If prices for a thing are high, there's both a supply problem (why isn't the market competitive?) and a demand issue (why is the good needed?)\n\nIf you simply set a price cap you end up distorting the market in strange ways; if we assume that for some reason the market has been cornered by predatory pharma and that no competitors are able to enter, they may well abandon a non-lucrative cost-center for something else leaving a gap in the market.\n\nGaetz is not saying that an individual should just get rid of their diabetes via slimming up. He is saying that the demand has spiked because diabetes has surged and that we should refocus on healthy lifestyles-- as pushed by Michelle Obama years ago. His statements on the importance of healthy diet and exercise are literal quotes from health guidelines and he acknowledges the difficulty of following that advice.\n\nHe isn't offering a solution to the prices, but in my opinion-- and I think this is Gaetz' point-- price caps are an absolute last resort that rarely accomplishes what you want.\n\nGaetz referenced FDR, and the history is instructive. During the depression FDR got heavily involved in the market, [specifically instituting price controls on food](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/11/21/do-farm-subsidies-protect-national-security/fdrs-disastrous-experiment). This actually directly increased food shortages as the market interference made it more lucrative to destroy food.\n\nWith insulin, a price cap might work-- or it might mean that production facilities are repurposed for other drugs, or that insulin is exported for higher prices, or that the divisions are sold off... It could result in shortages instead of low prices.\n\nThat again is not to say that they could not work, but I would personally start by asking what is restricting the market? With pharmaceuticals this is typically patents and regulation, and I wonder whetherInsulin production has a low barrier of entry that would allow a market solution if certain critical blockers were removed-- whether thats some FDA fast track or by fixing some patent minefield.",

When the people complained to the Queen that there was no bread, she replied \"let them eat cake.\" This was a self-inflicted wound. \n\nThis could cause shortages of insulin, if manufacturers cannot produce the product including payments for all the official graft and corruption in our system.",

Some people now pay more than $1,000 a month for insulin to treat diabetes, even with insurance. Democrats had been seeking a way to rein in drugs prices overall in a broader policy proposal, but it had little chance of passing the Senate. Hoping for bipartisan compromise, they siloed the insulin price control as its own measure. Still, only 12 House Republicans voted in favor of a bill that’s wildly popular with the American public.*\n\n*Among those voting “no” was Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), the GOP’s leading troll, who has come up with perhaps one of the most offensive justifications for GOP opposition to the popular bill. In his newsletter Friday, Gaetz told his constituents that he opposed the bill because fat people, not Big Pharma, are responsible for driving up the cost of insulin. He suggested that Type 2 diabetes, which is often linked to obesity, could be cured if only people would workout more and lose weight, at which point they wouldn’t need insulin anymore and the drug costs would fall without government intervention.*",

To say \"just eat healthy\" like it's no big deal is really out of touch (and again, has he met a diabetic? You try and eat healthy and your blood sugars go whack because the lack of carbs and the lack of nutritional labels on raw foods). It's not impossible, but it's definitely harder than making some hot dogs and mac and cheese or getting a $5 hot n ready pizza. If I had to choose insulin or food, I'm choosing insulin (I'm type 1, so my blood sugar is going to skyrocket eventually with no insulin even if I don't eat anything). \n\nInsulin isn't like a lot of other meds, if you don't take insulin you will die (especially if you're type 1), and for someone to just be like \"sorry, lose some weight\" (in his tweets he mentions \"I'm sorry for those born with Type 1\"...most Type 1s aren't born with it)...is very callous.",

I don’t agree with his fat-shaming horseshit and this is not about the people but the out of control drug cos— however it is true that people are seeing T2D and other ailments go away or reduce when they fix their gut and transition to a whole food lifestyle. However, what’s comsudered healthy on the food pyramid and 80% of the grocery store is mostly poison for your body and it’s kept that way to protect profits for big dairy, meat, ag. It is definitely possible to eat clean on the cheap (organic beans, rice, oats, lentils, seeds, fruit, veg) but also much organic/clean food is inflated for profit. Everyone is greedy. Additionally we are very sick because of all the chemicals everywhere that are outright banned in other countries. So if you want to blame lifestyle - then do something to help change the dangerous way we live. Most people haven’t even woken up to the problem or been given a chance to change because mainstream medicine doesn’t even recognize the gut or nutrition when it’s literally everything. \nDo you know diabetics usually lack akkermansia in their gut?

Or, a biological particle which carries a single instruction. It's like a post-it note or a memo that can travel through the blood stream. Cells randomly dip into the blood stream for their needs: oxygen, glucose, water, chicken. When (particular cells) see this post-it they take one (or a few if there's like really a lot) and it always means \"TAKE MORE GLUCOSE!\"\n\nThis signals to that cell to increase it's intake of glucose from the blood. The whole purpose of this is part of a checks and balances system to maintain a normal range of blood glucose levels. If your blood glucose is too low, glucose *needs* to be leaked back into the blood. If the blood is laden with glucose, generally because you have eaten very recently, the blood will be saturated with glucose and it needs to be removed. Removal is only a temporary storage within cells, it's not wasted or thrown out. It's just about clearing a traffic jam and letting those removed cars back into the flow a little later on. kinda. \n\nType I diabetics monitor their blood glucose levels manually. Taking a blood spot sample and using a glucose-o-meter to estimate the value. Let's just say it can be low, high, or good/normal.  \n\nWhen it's low it's a sign for the person to quickly eat a small sweet thing to bring it back up rapidly. When it's normal, it's a sign that nothing needs to be done. When it's high it's a sign that their blood is chonkers with food (glucose) and this needs to be taken up by cells. \n\nFor a healthy person high blood glucose automatically triggers the natural insulin response and you'd never even know about it. However Type I diabetics do not produce enough insulin (or any) due to a congenital disease. They try to produce insulin, but it comes out wonky looking; the wrong shape, colour and size. Cells do not recognise this particle as insulin, it just looks like junk. The cells which *should* be taking in the glucose right now are not because they aren't being told to; they think everything be fine.  This person injects themselves with a measured dose of artificial insulin. It makes its way through the blood stream and signals those cells to begin regular glucose take up. They recognise this signal and happily comply, no problem. \n\nThese cells are not faulty. They are normally functioning, and awaiting commands. It's the ... it's the bit that *makes* insulin (skipping details here, the organ in question is the pancreas). Remember that it can make the insulin particle but the recipe it uses to do this is wrong and it turns out wrong every time.  If this is weird to understand, you can imagine a more simple and effective equivalent which is zero insulin production. It's functionally the same and the accuracy is not important, the focus here is to highlight that there insulin is not being produced by the body. We supplement that with a lab made injectable version of the same particle. We use maths, behaviour, and lifestyle changes to accomplish what a normal body does unconsciously. When you think about it, it's a [gorram](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gorram) technological marvel, right? We're hacking a body system to get it to function properly. How fucking cool is that?\n\n------------------\n#     Insulin injections don't work for Type II\n------------------\n\nType II diabetes is the complete opposite of the above. This person is making normal insulin, in normal amounts, all of the time, no issues there at all. From the insulin side of things everything is A-Okay. Insulin is sent out into the blood during high blood glucose moments, and halted when they are normal again, or low. This person has zero need for insulin injections, just like you. \n\nSo... what's the deal?  The cells which would normally see the insulin and respond to the signal by taking in glucose have gone on strike. They have said \"fuck this shit\" and closed down their insulin-noticing-ability. They refuse to acknowledge  the post-it note. They have gone rogue due to being overly abused by the insulin system, and in retaliation they have simply chosen to no longer recognise the authority of insulin. \n\nThese people never buy insulin, they have no need for it.  They are also typically fat and it's through becoming overweight that has definitively lead to the condition of Type II Diabetes. Through poor diet they have injured themselves on a cellular level. Enough said. The focus here is only to highlight the difference, who needs insulin and who does not.\n\n------------------\n#     Rep. Gaetz is either stupid, or expects that you are\n------------------\n\n\nRep. Gaetz is reported to have said that insulin prices should not be capped, instead the people who would normally buy insulin should lose weight. \n\nHe has not understood the difference between Type I and II diabetes. The 'fat' people don't use or need insulin. The people who need insulin are not fat. \n\nRep. Gaetz is either fucking stupid, or has something to gain from pretending to be. If the latter then he is expecting you to be the former; fucking stupid.\n\nIf you rely on a technology to circumvent a health issue that you had no control over, you are in the exact same category as type I diabetics who rely on insulin.

When I was in my early 20s, I lost my health insurance and couldn’t afford $200 for a vial of insulin. I needed 3 vials a month, in addition to test strips, rent, food, college tuition, text book fees. My job paid $8.00/hour. I literally did nothing but work, sleep, and go to class and I was lucky that my type of job allowed me to study at work and that as a professor’s kid I got half off tuition. I was rationing my insulin, and my blood sugars were routinely sitting in the high 300s (for reference, most diabetics want to be in the 70-120 range). \n\nSuper dumbed down science lesson: normally your body uses insulin like a baby bottle to feed sugar from your blood stream to your cells. I’m Type 1 diabetics, our bodies decided the cells that make insulin were a germ and killed them all so we don’t make our own. So our cells are starving. Our bodies then start feeding our fat reserves to our cells instead. This can be problematic for a variety of reasons (I’m not going to get into ketosis vs ketoacidosis right now), and one of the more noticeable symptoms of undiagnosed T1 diabetes is rapid weight loss without a reduction in appetite. I was 5’11” and 105 lbs. Thats about 50 lbs underweight. I was so sick. \n\nThose “just lose weight” comments are a slap in the face. 1) for people whose medical issues would be made easier with weight loss, it isn’t that easy. 2) if I lost any more weight I would probably die. 3) CAN WE PLEASE STOP ELECTING LEGISLATORS THAT ARE SO IGNORANT AND UNEDUCATED THAT THEY KNOW FUCK ALL ABOUT SCIENCE AND SO EGOTISTICAL THAT THEY REFUSE TO LEARN?!",

We pay upwards of $300 a month for his pump supplies currently.\n\nBut simply taxing the American public to pay for it is ignoring the issue. Its like acknowledging their are rapists and sexual predators in our midst and saying that providing inexpensive healthcare after you've been raped is the final solution.\n\nCurrently, the one \"raping\" the diabetic public is the pharmaceutical industry. Insulin is a necessary drug for the survival of diabetics, and they are using that fact to drive up costs 1000%. Insulin could be made available at tremendously cheaper prices if regulation were brought to curb the abuse by the pharmaceutical companies practices. THIS is the legislation we need - not some bandaid that just drives up our spiralling government debt and subsequently our taxes and cost of living.\n\nI'm not a republican, but it makes me rage when I see people needlessly politicizing a serious health issue to feed their incessant political fundamentalism.

There's certainly some value to the more expensive options others no one would buy it. How much of the improvements are bells and whistles no one needs vs genuine improvements? \n\nIt's also true that regardless of how charitable a drug company is, it simply can't operate on nothing margins. Companies, research, production lines can't change instantly and government regulation can and should come in to apply a gentle nudge to free open markets when they run off the rails.\n\nI have no idea what the cheapest available option is currently and what the marginal cost of production is but if the marginal cost of the drug is more than 35/month/patient then such a law will just instantly destroy all production. If the goal is to sustainably lower cost to patients they should set the cap at a level where at least a few companies can operate profitably on an operational basis, this would force companies to pivot towards investing into efficient production but inevitably you will lose competition in the market as some participants no longer wish to be in the game. That's fine so long as you are left with a few players who can still operate indefinitely.",

This restriction does not apply to discounts provided to insurance plan holders at retail sale or to flat-rate fees for service paid to PBMs. Further, insurance plans are prohibited from applying a deductible to insulin that has received such price certification.\n\nA manufacturer may certify insulin prices by submitting to the Department of Health and Human Services data about the list price of any insulin the manufacturer has produced since January 1, 2000, and by setting the current list price for an insulin product at the 2006 rate. To remain certified, a manufacturer may not increase the list price of insulin by more than the annual increase in the medical care consumer price index. A manufacturer may certify the price of an insulin product for which it did not have a list price in 2006 by reducing the list price of such insulin to the weighted average list price in 2006 of specified insulin categories.\n\nThis bill also applies to Medicare prescription drug benefits. The bill sets the rebate for insulin under Medicaid based on the average manufacturer price of insulin during the last fiscal quarter of 2019, increasing by the medical care consumer price index thereafter.",

Doctors prescribe a band aid pill that never addresses the root cause of the issues: diet/lifestyle factors. Overall diabetes is widely preventable. No, a persons weight is not a stand alone indicator of diabetes, and neither is heredity. However, the vast majority of obese and overweight people struggle with a form of “insulin resistance” which unaddressed will result in diabetes. Poor blood sugar regulation in non diabetics can attribute to difficulty controlling weight and eventually developing diabetes. The diabetes and insulin resistance(pre diabetes) epidemic is caused by the common Standard American Diet, excessive, processed high sugar, fast food consumption, not getting the 90 minutes of recommended DAILY exercise, yes 1.5 hours each day, are exposed to constant high levels of stress and alcohol/drug consumption. These are ALL factors that can directly impact insulin production. As difficult as it is for many people to hear, your health is ultimately your responsibility. Sadly we cannot depend on anyone else, including the government, to provides us with the necessary access to education, tools and food to make better health choices. Education is power, ask your doctor questions, better yet do your OWN research. I have worked with clients on high doses of insulin who through simple diet and lifestyle changes were able to come off of medication completely, in weeks not months! We definitely underestimate the power of food and a healthy lifestyle as medicine.",
