God damn, I do.  All he would have had to do was nothing; the US attorneys are still investigating Hunter.  He may very well end up in prison.

Let's apply this to previous presidencies in times of conflict and see if this applies. \n\nLets look at some alt-history scenarios:  \n\n\nHypothetical example:  2012 Democratic President Barack Obama publicly calls on ISIS to reveal what information they have on Mitt Romney's son Tagg Romney.\n\nHypothetical example:    2008 Democratic Candidate Barack Obama appeals publicly to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il for intel on John McCain's daughter Meghan. \n\nHypothetical example:    2004 - Democratic candidate John Kerry publicly appeals to Saddam Hussein to reveal what information he has on Jenna Bush.   \n\nHypothetical example:    2000 - Republican candidate George W Bush publicly appeals to Chinese President Jiang Zemin for intel on Gore's daughter Kristen. \n\nHypothetical example:    1996 President Bill Clinton publicly calls on Russian President Boris Yeltsin to publicly reveal what information the Kremlin has on Republican candidate Bob Dole's daughter, Robin. \n\nHypothetical example:    1992 Independent candidate Ross Perot publicly calls on Somalia to reveal what information it has on the children of President George H.W. Bush. \n\n\n21st century Republicans think this is acceptable, somehow. Lost their damned minds.\n\nedit: For clarity, none of these things happened. Why? Because, even with all of their flaws Barack Obama, John Kerry, GW Bush, Bill Clinton, or the late Ross Perot were not TRAITORS to the United States in league with a hostile foreign nation.\n\nDonald Trump is absolutely guilty of treason. The only reason why he is immune to any consequence is because the Republican Party will always find a way to excuse him and protect him from the consequences that any other American would face.

            "text": "I regard Donald Trump as significantly more dangerous for the world, than Putin, if you can even believe that. Putin is a tyrant in charge of a medium sized economy, that just happens to have a massive nuclear arsenal. Whilst not necessarily wise, Putin isn‚Äôt stupid. He won‚Äôt use nuclear weapons because he doesn‚Äôt want to die. \n\nTrump is more dangerous because in my view, the greatest thing to ever happen to the world is the USA winning the Cold War and being the only super power. The USA is a benign superpower and stands for principles that we can all get behind. It absolutely is not perfect, but I would far rather the USA be the sole global superpower, than say China, Russia or many other candidates. The EU is maybe the exception here. It is not hard to imagine a fairly grim world with a high if a fairly high number of countries had the power that the US has had through the 20th century.\n\nAnyway, the point being, the USA, if it falls into becoming a different type of country, through someone like Trump effectively ending democracy, is far more likely to lead to a dark world for all of us than anything Putin is likely to do. The USA is and has been for a century, a buttress against the dark side of humanity, despite itself having veered dangerously close to that darkness post 9/11. Trump is the living manifestation of the worst excesses of the USA, an inward-looking cynical populist with almost zero personal integrity and not a single personal principle. He‚Äôs a shallow egotist and could conceivably burn everything down for his own personal interests, and he is more volatile than Putin. And unlike Putin and Russia, it really matters if the USA is a principled global superpower upholding certain standards on behalf of all of us.\n\nSo, from a concerned Brit, please do what you need to do to stop this traitor leading your country again, and hold him accountable for what he quite blatantly has been trying to do for several years.",
