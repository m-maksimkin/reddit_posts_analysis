She represents, at large, a community of people in this country.\n\nThe quote:\n\n>I tell you what pumpkin. How about you suit up and report to your commander and chief yourself and tell him your reporting for duty. You might want to train a little first, the only thing in shape on you and prepared for war is your little Twitter thumbs.\n\nThis is, by far, one of the most hilariously, grammatically incorrect screeds, I've ever seen.  Rife with punctuation errors, misspellings, and just a general lack of grasp on the English language.\n\nHere is my, admittedly uneducated, edit.  And I want to stress, again, this woman is a representative of a collective population of the USA.  I am but a lowly internet know-it-all.\n\n>I['ll] tell you what[,] pumpkin ~~.~~[;] How about you suit up[,] and report to your commander ~~and~~ [in] chief yourself[.~~]and~~ ~~t~~[T]ell him ~~your~~[you're] reporting for duty.\n[Insert line break]\n\n>You might want to train a little first~~,~~[:] the only thing in shape on you[,] and prepared for war[,] ~~is~~ [are] your ~~little~~(*repeating \"*little*\" is unnecessarily redundant, and therefor superfluous*) Twitter thumbs.\n\nHere is what the tweet should have looked like; all editing marks have been removed:\n\n>I'll tell you what, pumpkin; how about you suit up, and report to your commander in chief yourself.\n\n>Tell him you're reporting for duty.
