Remember Rep. Kevin McCarthy, to which Trump said something to the effect of \"well I guess they are more upset about the election than you are...\"\n\nRep. McCarthy's phone # is not likely to be some sort of secret.  If the J6 committee doesn't *already* have his call records, it's a trivial matter to request all of Rep. McCarthy's call metadata for that day.  Same with some of the other congressmen he allegedly spoke to - Mike Lee, Tommy Tuberville, etc.  So they will likely know what phone #s Trump was speaking on during the day - even if it's multiple phones.\n\nThen we just use those #s and look for all the *outgoing* calls.  There's a new pool of numbers to look at.  Hmmm ... are any calls to \"burner\" phones which were apparently purchased by the Stop The Steal rally planners?\n\nIf the WH had the audacity to use any \"burner\" phones internally they will likely show up as well at some point, perhaps as return calls from those Stop The Steal planners.  There's so many ways to draw linkages on all of this over time, with just a few \"known\" data points.\n\nAnd then you have all the tower data which can be used to locate where the phones were.  If I'm not mistaken, Congress has dedicated towers - it's one of the ways the DOJ has been proving that certain rioters were *inside* the building.  I wonder if the WH has the same thing.  Even still, it would be easy to show that the burners were at least within the tower coverage that covers the WH.\n\nIf the J6 committee isn't crafting a subopena for AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc. asking for all call logs on January 6th between all the phone numbers they already know about ... I'd be surprised.  In fact, I suspect they've probably got a lot of the carrier data already (which is why something like these call logs can now be \"leaked\" to the press, because they know they have the missing pieces).",
