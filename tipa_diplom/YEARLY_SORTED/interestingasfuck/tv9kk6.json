No seriously unless you are rich and influencial (both not either) you don't really matter. Lobbyists rule for att intended purposes.\n\nI honestly wish politicians wore stickers like they do in Nascar, displaying all the parties that are financially backing them so you can at least see who is really pulling the strings.",

As a live witness to the misery and anger, I would like to speak out. My family consisted of my husband, myself and two children…, a family of four.\n\n>On August 6, Showa 20 (1945), just after 8 am, we had just finished breakfast. As my husband was reading the morning paper, and I was cleaning up the breakfast dishes, our two children played nearby. Suddenly, what seemed like a streak of lightning lit the sky, followed by a thunderous noise. The house collapsed around us, and we were trapped.\n\n>As my husband and I were trying with all our might to escape, we heard, \"Help me! Help me!\" Our next door neighbor's wife was calling for help. I called out to her, \"As soon as we get free, we will come to help you!\"\n\n>When we finally escaped from our fallen house, the first thing we saw was the total destruction of the city of Hiroshima. No houses or other buildings were visible. They had all disappeared. Fires were evident here and there. In my shock and fear, my only thought was escape. And, in my fear and rush to escape, I forgot the promise to help our neighbor's wife. My thoughts swirled around finding our children.\n\n>Where are our children? As we called out our children's names, we heard, \"Help me, Mother! Help me, Mother!\", coming from a distance of about 2 or 3 meters away. I rushed in that direction. It was my own 6 year old daughter, Kazuko. I began calling for my husband who was at that time barely able to move. \"Come quickly!\" I screamed.\nAt that time my husband was bleeding from the shoulder and was badly injured. He was so weak that he was barely able to walk.\nOur daughter was screaming out, \"Mother, my legs hurt, my legs hurt! My legs are trapped. Help me to get them free!\"\nI struggled to free her, but no matter how hard I pulled, her legs remained trapped. She was covered from the chest down by debris from the walls of the house and by dirt. It was impossible to free her.\n\n>As I continued to pull on her, the fires were fast approaching. I could see and hear and smell the fires. I was hot and unable to breathe, and could no longer continue my struggle. At that moment, I knew that if I stayed I would die. Dying was not a choice I was willing to make. I could not imagine being burned to death.\n\n>I said a prayer for my children. \"Kazu-chan, I am sorry. I am a bad mother. Please forgive me. Kazu-chan, I know you don't want to die, either, but your Mother does not have courage to face the fire. Kazu-chan, forgive me, forgive me!\" I said as I turned and walked toward the area that was free of fire. I took my husband's hand to help him escape with me, but as we moved away, our hearts were left behind with our daughter.\n\n>As we escaped, we didn't realize that we were stepping and falling over dead bodies. As I stumbled and fell on those bodies, I was not affected by a feeling of creepiness. I just felt a deep sadness. As we continued our escape, we realized that we had made it to the riverside of Yokokawa.",

This resulted in many (most) of the pieces of equipment placed to collect data on the test being destroyed, and the residents who were assured that Bikini Atoll would be suitable to return to after the tests were conducted to be permanently forced to relocate.

            "text": "It is beyond f'ed up that our government literally made our servicemen sit on the deck of a ship to purposefully be exposed to a nuclear wave. I guess you can make the argument for negligence and underestimating the potential effects. As a veteran, it feels like patriotism is ALWAYS exploited instead of rewarded by Uncle Sam.   \n\n\nIts a sad state of things and a large part of why I got out after 4 years. The people that die for the military industrial complex and other policy never really have a dog in that fight. It's wealthy industrialists and other corporate interests that always stand to gain from war. I hope that one day we quit using our service members as pawns and give them their due respect as the vanguard of our security. Sorry for the negative Nancy rant. The whole thing just really bothers me on principle.",

            "text": "Based on the reference to the _HMS Warrior_, I believe the test referred to here is the “Grapple 2” test. This was billed as thermonuclear test but it ended up being “only” the largest fission detonation in history. It was about 750 kilotons, or about 50 times the power of Hiroshima. \n\nGo to 6:33 of reel 9 [here](https://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/record/1181/media_id/12617) to see footage of this test. It shows the _Warrior_ and the crew on the deck, doing what these men describe: turning away, crouching, covering their eyes. The white suits are to protect them from burns. Some of the veterans are probably in this footage. There is no on-deck footage of the moment of detonation (it would just be a white screen) but you can watch aerial footage. \n\nThe official exclusion radius was 35 nautical miles, so the _Warrior_ was around 40 miles (65 km) away from the detonation. This is consistent with what we see in the footage. It is a testament to the incomprehensible power of the explosion that they felt the incredible light and heat from that far away, and that the mushroom cloud still appears gigantic. \n\nThe sailors’ radiation injuries were probably not due to being directly irradiated by the test (since they were so far away) but from ingesting radioactive contamination during the overall mission, even though this was an “airburst” 2400 meters in the air, intended to minimize fallout. Contamination and fallout were not as well understood at that time, nuclear safety practices were looser, and the Brits’ first bombs were “dirtier” than they thought (or acknowledged). But there are definitely secrets about this test that the British government to this day chooses not to reveal. \n\nThe _Warrior_ was decommissioned not long after this, but many of these sailors stayed on Operation Grapple for even larger thermonuclear tests. \n\nThe main thing these veterans want today is compensation and care for their offspring, who evidently have genetic anomalies that have been and will continue to be passed down. The British government still asserts that the veterans were too far away to have any radiation injury, and that there is no increased disease among these veterans.",
