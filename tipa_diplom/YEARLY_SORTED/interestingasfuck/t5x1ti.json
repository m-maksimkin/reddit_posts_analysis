They further promised to work closely with Hitler, then helped to launch a pogrom that killed four thousand Lvov Jews in a few days, using weapons ranging from guns to metal poles.  “We will lay your heads at Hitler’s feet,” a Banderist pamphlet proclaimed to Ukrainian Jews.”\n\nhttps://historynewsnetwork.org/article/122778",

            "text": "I read that for the first two years of his presidency he was in absolute agony. In order to accept his presidential win he had to have a tube ran under his skin down his back to permanently inject morphine into his system. \n\nNow, I wear a fentanyl patch for pain. It puts a measure of fentanyl into my system 24/7 for three days. Upon which I add liquid OxyContin when the pain is intolerable. That this man managed such a big job whilst basically wearing a morphine drip is astounding. \n\nEven after years, I still tend to fall to sleep when the liquid kicks in. Either because I’m so exhausted by pain that when it’s relieved I fall to sleep and/or because it just makes me so drowsy. It is not something I can take, even with my tolerance levels,  without a very definite reaction to it when it’s starting to do its job. It is illegal for me to drive. It is extremely irresponsible if I cycle on my electric bike within an hour or two of taking the liquid. But to not take it means I cannot leave the house and to stay out for so long that it wears off means I am likely to be stuck wherever I am until my body adjusts to the next dose. \n\nSo I am personally quite in awe that this man was capable of making the kind of decisions a president must take, at any hour, sometimes without notice. Decisions that effect the lives of more than 44,000,000 souls. The agony he was in for the first few years is the kind of pain that I know is all consuming. It is greater than the obsession one develops about food when malnourished and starving. Or the total consumption of thoughts about water when severely dehydrated The compartmentalisation required to simply try to do a jigsaw or indeed any repetitive activity that allows a person to do anything more than curl into a foetal position takes extreme concentration. Obsession even. I wonder if that pain management was the reason he spent so much time caring for his plants? Regardless of how he had to manage that pain, it was a “win” for those that poisoned him - because it requires such obsession to just continue to live. Often in five minute intervals, five mins by five mins, every hour of every day. Regardless of the man’s politics- he gets my great respect if only for the personal mental strength it would have taken to achieve what he did. \n\nIt took a certain personality type to poison a man with agent orange as he runs The Orange Revolution. A psychopathic sense of cruelty and spite. Yet now Putin has achieved what the Orange Revolution could not - Ukraine’s acceptance into the EU. All whilst I marvel at the bravery of the people of Ukraine. This has been a long time coming.",
