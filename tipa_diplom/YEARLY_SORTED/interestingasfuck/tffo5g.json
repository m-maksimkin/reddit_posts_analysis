We met as teens and I truly had never had a serious or real relationship before him. It took me 5 years to ask myself if he was abusive and if this was normal or not. \n\nI would have a plan to get my hair cut, he would come for no reason when I did not ask and sit there forcing our five year old to sit there also. He would say he didn‚Äôt want to waste gas to go home and back but it was super close and I paid for the gas‚Ä¶ but he would sit knowing I was getting a treatment and cut with wash and style so it would be an hour or so. \n\nHe would scowl and huff and roll his eyes at me from across the chair so I would start to feel distress. It got to where the stylist told me she had been in abusive relationship too and that I should start asking myself if this was one. That it wasn‚Äôt okay and that getting my hair done twice a year at a low cost school salon I paid for didn‚Äôt make me a horrible person. \nHe would sit there just to have a reason to be mad. \n\nThen shopping. He would come and insist he come and then huff and puff and scold me for anything I bought. I was buying a 5 dollar small thing on sale at bath and body works and he goes and rips the money from my hand mid air me handing it to the cashier and tells her I‚Äôm not going to be buying it and then shamed me and embarrassed me in front of the whole store calling me an idiot and telling me I don‚Äôt need it. Again my own money. His money didn‚Äôt go to me ever but somehow mine went to him. \n\nIt got to the point my hands would shake if I tried on clothes because I would start to worry it was taking too long and then I would have to deal with being punished by him acting hostile and off with me but not saying it. Like a child who knows they are in trouble. \n\nI went Christmas shopping for HIM with my dad at night and he couldn‚Äôt go bc it was for him. My dad and I had fun and then I told him I should probably get home bc I would get in trouble for being gone so long. He looked at me and said ‚Äú in trouble? How do you get in trouble? What?!‚Äù I realised that this was not something everyone does. \n\nOver time he began to take and control all my money and eventually make it so I couldn‚Äôt work and was made to stay home with our child. He sold my car that my dad had gotten me and I paid off out from under me to someone on Craigslist without me knowing. He forged my signature on a hand written bill he wrote. \n\nI didn‚Äôt have a license yet only a learners and my dad got me the car to help me get over my fear and learn. I loved it and was doing great but he didn‚Äôt want that.  So i ended up stuck at home all the time and he moves us off to Colorado where we know not a single person and have never been and it‚Äôs 21 hours from home.  \n\nNow I‚Äôm super isolated. Eventually he started controlling every single thing I did. Including getting mad and accusing me of cheating for being in the bathroom too long and not unlocking the door. I was shitting. I have chrons. \n\nI wanted a slurpee and at this point I don‚Äôt even have a dollar and like a child I have to beg him for anything I want. \nI needed a dollar. I had been a in home nanny and he was taking all my pay and I wanted a dollar of it. He said no. \n\nHe called me disgusting sub human scum for asking for a slurpee and looked at me with hate and disgust like I was truly just nasty and a thing not a living being. I‚Äôll never forget it because he has all these peta and vegan stickers on his car (he feigns animal love like most sociopaths) and it said respect all lives! Love me don‚Äôt eat me! And I‚Äôm looking at this respect all lives sticker as he calls me subhuman scum and tells me the world would be better off without me. \n\nEventually it ramped up to being physically abused often and then to him attempting to end all three of our lives. I left after that. \n\nI still say sorry too much. Every time I shop I say sorry every four seconds and feel anxiety. It‚Äôll never go away. My first date after him asked me ‚Äúwhat for? Why do you keep saying that? You‚Äôve done nothing wrong. This is fun. This looks great on you! You should get it.‚Äù \n\nI wonder if I‚Äôll ever stop feeling that feeling or not. \n\n\nMy point was that I used to think these spots were for other monsters like my ex to keep them from being so angry and hateful or something. Like if they stayed busy they wouldn‚Äôt tell you you were a worthless whore who is nothing and you could die and nobody would notice or care just because you tried on a sweater and liked how it looked. \n\nI don‚Äôt really understand them now bc I think stay home if you don‚Äôt wanna go. I like doing shit on my own anyway. I totally get it. I have fun actively choosing things with partners or friends as well so either way.",
