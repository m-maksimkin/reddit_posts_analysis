Ironically, the most discussed item in our Agenda back then was de-escalation of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in the Donbass region.

It's very surreal to witness a full blown war, the thing the UN (and therefore us simulating it) were trying to prevent all the way back, and the actual ambassadors and diplomats use such straightforward language and burns in the real worst case scenario.
