            "text": "Tbh I’m astonished by the amount of faith some people here have in a theory about a process that has never been directly observed (to the extent of full speciation). Not saying who’s wrong and who’s right, but there are so many examples of fascinating species with incredibly specific characteristics that a) they could have easily survived without or b) would have no evolutionary advantage (and perhaps even a disadvantage) during the millions of years it took to finally complete said characteristics. As a software engineer, I know firsthand how incredibly difficult it is to create something that looks and functions correctly, even *with* immense intentionality and direction behind it, and that the chaos of chance overwhelmingly produces the opposite result. As we look for signs of life in the universe and even in our own history, do we not see patterns and structure and art (which this caterpillar arguably qualifies for) as signs of intelligence? How much more specific and intentional of characteristics could an animal have before there’s no more naturalistic explanation? I totally get people thinking it’s silly to believe in a supernatural creator, but it seems as much of a leap of faith to hold to something you equally have not seen, and relies on trillions upon trillions of statistically improbable outcomes with no intentionality at all to produce better machines and systems than billions of intelligent minds intentionally working for thousands of years have been able to. To each his own, but hard not to contemplate when seeing such a brilliant creature.",

I mean I'm curious is a caterpillar can even see it. Also how does the caterpillar know snakes are dangerous to birds?\n\nLet's say I realise pittbull dogs are dangerous, I see it with my eyes. I know this as an intelligent being. How on earth do we translate that into me influencing my genes to start changing my children over 1000s or 100, 000s years?\n\nThere would be prototype caterpillars with lots of random attempts at looking like a snake. But like I said how would the dna know to make a change, also the change would look like a deformity! For 1000 if not 100000s years.\n\nI believe in minor adaptions that are in our dna coding. But not complete species change. Random selection doesn't cut it because it narrows the gene pool not increases it as well.\n\nIf this makes sense or even if it doesn't look up intelligent design and have an open mind. Science isn't a religion but it's an open field for all to delve in.\n\nThanks if you read up to here. Tc Salaam.",

This caterpillar doesn’t know that it looks like a scary snake it just knows through instinct that when it does this it usually doesn’t get eaten. This developed over millions of years and millions of mutations. The ones that looked more snake like ended up dying less therefore being able to produce more kin and continue on. I think its important to note that nature repeats itself constantly. Fossil record shows that over eons and multiple extinction events evolution developed in many of the same ways. Look at how many things have fur or teeth or claws or fins or armored shells or arms/legs. A lot of that is because of common ancestors but not always. Bats and squirrels are more closely related than bats and crows despite them both having wings. You may say duh bats and squirrels are birthing mammals and crows are egg laying avians. At the other end of the spectrum you have sharks and dolphins. They look quite similar and share a lot of the same body parts but they’re very far apart. Sharks lay eggs and dolphins are mammals. Australia has a lot of good examples of this as it’s been separate a very long time yet still developed many strikingly similar species to the rest of the world.",
