O’Neill Jr. Tunnel. The project also included the construction of the Ted Williams Tunnel (extending I-90 to Logan International Airport), the Leonard P.

They ended up pumping liquid nitrogen into the ground to make it very stable and the tunnel proceeded without a hitch.\n\nLastly, this was the largest ever civil engineering project at the time.

There are over **30 thousand** more car trips through the CBD in Boston in just the last decade. That's not progress that's **induced demand** manifesting itself. Boston has the worst congestion per capita of major metropolitan areas in North America.  That's not progress.\n\nA project that was supposed to cost $6B ran over **$26B**. So bad were the cost overruns that they legally cooked the books, shifting $8B of cost overruns onto the MBTA in the name of \"Forward Funding\" for projects the T was *supposed* to see out of the Big Dig as \"mitigating\" factors (Roxbury/South End Silver ~~Line~~ Lie, South Boston/Seaport/Airport Silver Line, Chelsea Silver Line, Green Line Extension). The Roxbury/South End Silver Lie was reduced from light rail to $hitty 3-rd rate BRT; the South Boston/Seaport/Airport Silver Line and Chelsea Silver Line are a joke with low frequencies and circuitous routing; the Green Line extension is 16 years behind schedule, after being sued circa seven years ago to even make good on a promise to complete it. Even as I type it, GLX is still only a third done, with the longer branch delayed in opening three times already in the last six months.\n\nMeanwhile, other enormously beneficial green projects like connecting the Blue and Red Lines; electrifying the Commuter Rail, which still uses some Reagan-era diesel engines; and extending the Blue and Orange Lines are *long* on the backburner. Let alone, connecting North and South Station, eliminating the less-than-two-mile break in otherwise over 1000 miles of Amtrak trackage in the Northeast.
