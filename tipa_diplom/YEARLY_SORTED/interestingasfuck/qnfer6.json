They then later doubled-down by expanding a perpendicular street (that goes to a different bridge) into another highway.\n\nWhat used to be a small street with a beautiful linear park down the middle is now a monstrosity of a truck route that has physically divided a neighbourhood in half. The east side is cut off from accessing the core of walkable streets with shops and services and the west side is cut off from the river and parks.\n\nIt's honestly a catastrophe, particularly for people living in the Lowertown 'Wedge'.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the houses and entire neighbourhoods that were expropriated and razed to the ground to build the highway on and off ramps.\n\nhttp://www.pastottawa.com/comparison/king-edward-avenue-rideau-looking-north/333/",

What works in Europe doesn't necessarily work here, we scrapped our expansive electric trolley networks 100 years ago in favor of less efficient car/city bus and hwy systems because it would make the rich richer.\n\nRemoving our highways in favor of cyclists and tourists comes at the huge expense of the average working person's commute increasing by 50-100%. It's not like we can ditch our cars here, we still have to drive and we spend longer on the road which creates more emissions. It's one of those things that looks good on paper and in pictures.
