It's not because of you or anyone who owns them, it's because when I was a little little kid I was in love with astronomy, and there was this observatory in my town that was having a one-night showing of saturn through a telescope. There's a bunch of kids in line around this thing, it was the dead of night and the stars were out, and when it was my turn, I stepped up to the telescope and... It looked about a thousand times shittier than anything I've ever ever seen on any subreddit. Any. I'm not kidding, it looked like they poked a vaguely saturn shaped hole in a black piece of paper and put a light behind it, and then stuck it in front of the lens. My little 6 year old mind was so disillusioned, thinking \"the planets look nothing like the ones I've seen, it's just all artist renditions, they probably all look that.\" I even left my little astronaut toy there, I was so sad. Every time I see these developed photos, I can't help but wonder what kind of enjoyment I'd still get out of stuff like this to this day if it weren't for their 2$ telescope. Anyway it's a really great photo, I'll stop blabbing :3",

I have 49yrs of astronomy and a number of scopes I have used the only way I could get an image like this is to take a large number of images and stack them then adjust the light. the other thing to notice is Saturn shouldn't be that bright. so the image has been doctored its not a point camera on scope at Saturn and click. you need to do timelaps to get the detail and stack images. in my opinion its wrong for the size of scope and looks doctored it could also be someone else's work and they person is claiming its theirs. its surprising how often that happens. may be a 16inch not 6.",

I saw bright tiny stars near Jupiter, and didn’t think much of it… then it hit me that those were not stars but the moons of Jupiter. \n\nEverything was both larger and smaller than I’d imagined.  Like I didn’t think i’d see anything, but what I saw was clear but still so small.  Made me feel so fortunate, because my shitty telescope was ten times better than the best telescope Galileo had. \n\nHonestly think seeing the other planets through a telescope of your own is transformative.",
