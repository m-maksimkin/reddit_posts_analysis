The fact that we're still in Afghanistan(where no such WMDs were found and had nothing to do with the attack)  alone is enough to make me question what happened and what the motives were. I'm no expert on intelligence and military tactics but seriously, why the hell have we been there this ENTIRE time? I find it pretty funny how lazy the critics of a possible conspiracy actually are. Its always the same:\n\n\"Lets just make jokes about it and mock anyone we dont agree with so that we don't actually have to address any of the suspicious details!\"\n\nFriendly reminder that to this very day there has not been a single photo of an airplane hitting the pentagon. Not a single one has been released where you actually see a plane. The funny this is people don't know this. They believe they've seen a plane hit the pentagon.\n\nThey officially acknowledged that theres other footage that was confiscated and none of it has been made public. Not to mention the plane conveniently rammed into the most fortified edge( in the most difficult maneuver possible instead of simply aiming at the large surface area of the roof of the structure that would have inflicted significantly more damage) with next to nobody working on that side. How convenient for them.\n\nAnd heres the thing. I'm not married to any ideas here. I have no idea what happened. But examining the details makes it difficult for me to believe the official story. I'm naturally skeptical of the government and have an understanding that conspiracies do in fact exist and have been executed by the government in the past. False flag events have been officially recognized as possibilities the military has considered. My question is, why in the world would you take what the government says at face value? Maybe its because I grew up in a cult but I've learned that people and organizations can and will lie to you. And I have no intentions of being duped simply because its convenient to believe while getting to avoid ridicule.\n\nEdit: Someone pointed out that I should have mentioned Iraq instead of Afghan. Maybe I'm wrong but I thought we went into Afghan shortly after we invaded Iraq. Regardless, We're still occupying both of those countries. Now, correct me again if I'm wrong but neither of those places have anything to do with 9/11. Osamas been caught. What are we trying to accomplish?",

Was watching live when the camera zoomed out a bit amd the second plane hit live on T.V. i remember the whole class going silent and me personally speaking out loud \"Holy Shit\" . . . . . watched the whole process all day. When the first tower fell and we watched it live, it was truly the first time i watched people die outside of a movie and at that scale, i pushed all that pain aside. I wanted to cry but i was so mad that they were innocent people and this happened to them. I turned to another kid i grew up with Abdul, i told him \"Bro i got your back if this was a terrorist attack. People get stupid in these moments. Let me know if anyone fucks with you.\" He later told me at our reunion if i hadn't said that to him he would have been so scared at school.",

            "text": "I was in middle school in Pennsylvania at the time, I remember I was wearing my hair in pigtails with one yellow and one pink bow that day, that’s how young I was. During first period my science teacher burst into our homeroom unexpectedly and said “Here’s a piece of history for you — two planes flew into the Twin Towers in New York City.” I was instantly confused about what year that piece of history had happened, why I had never heard of it and why he chose that moment to interrupt our class to tell us about it. It wasn’t until they wheeled a CRT television cart into the classroom and put on the live broadcast of what was happening that it dawned on me in ice cold horror that it was happening right now. My science teacher’s oddly smug way of announcing it had failed to make it clear to me that it was CURRENTLY HAPPENING. The picture on the TV was so staticky that we could barely make out what was going on, but it was enough to see more smoke and soot billowing out of the two largest buildings I knew of than I had ever seen in my entire life. My family took a long road trip to NYC once to visit the Twin Towers, they were marvelously enormous, mighty, bright and shining, and made the rest of NYC look like a tiny toy city.\n\nThey stopped showing us live coverage before, or maybe right as, the towers fell. A particularly annoying girl in my class yelled in a panicked voice, “They’re gone! The towers have collapsed — they’re just GONE!” And I instantly reacted with disbelief and irritation. What news source did she have that the rest of us didn’t? What do you mean *gone*, they’re the biggest buildings I’ve ever seen, they don’t just DISAPPEAR. That’s preposterous. A few minutes later it was confirmed more broadly that they had, in fact, crumbled to the ground in a massive cloud of debris and smoke. Leveled, nearly, just like that. Thousands of people trapped inside to meet the most horrific end imaginable to my young mind, all of them unsuspecting on their morning commute that day that they’d kissed their families goodbye for the last time and would never escape their offices.\n\nMost people, teachers included, just stopped talking entirely at that point. Everyone was in tears. Our school was across the street from a military armory that they were concerned could be a secondary target, so our school was evacuated at that point and we were all sent home.\n\nOur lives and the entire world changed that day. Humans have been committing unspeakable acts for millennia before 2001 but none of us could recall such a singularly heinous, catastrophic, destructive act take place in essentially one instant before, live on television from the heart of one of the world’s greatest metropolises, ever. I was a kid and the sheer loss of innocence it wrought was overwhelming for a time.\n\nMy husband (who grew up in NYC) and I agree that to us the timeline of the history we’ve lived during is basically split into two eras: pre- and post-9/11. That day changed us and the world forever. It’s strangely difficult to relate to people who don’t remember it and don’t think it was that big of a deal.",

I had always dreamed of visiting NY (I live in Missouri) and standing atop the south tower. In July 3, 2000 I married my husband in Vermont. Being that close to NYC, we decided to drive to NYC and on July 4, 2000, we stood atop the south tower. 14 months later they were gone. I am so thankful I got the opportunity to tour the towers before it was too late. I also felt more personally affected by their destruction.",

All my life growing up in West Germany, the USA were our big powerful brother, making sure WW3 wouldn't turn my country (and me) into radioactive ash or worse - a half burned, puking living agony.

We had very graphic children's novels about nukes and I knew the physics of the atom bomb by age 10.\n\nIt was clear that day the calm times after the cold war were over and the world would change.

There were a few whispers and then the priest paused and said “I was just informed that an airplane has just collided with one of the trade towers. We don’t know many details so let us all pray for the health and safety of those involved.” I remember my friend asked me (as the airplane fan) what it probably was. I told him most likely a private plane and some mechanical issue. We had no idea obviously.\n\nHe continued with the sermon and we finished and left. We went back to our homerooms where there was a tv set up already covering the news. Our teacher said “class, a passenger aircraft has just struck one of the trade towers. Instead of normal class we will watch this.” And so we did, and almost instantly after the second plane hit on live TV. It was only 10 or so minutes after we heard about the first plane. I remember it happened so fast. Church at 830, news of plane, scurrying to class, one sentence from teacher, second plane. Then a really uncomfortable silence.\n\nThe teacher then said “Some days we witness history and never know it. Today you do, and you will remember this forever. Most of history is made up of terrible events. This is what it is like to live through it. Be extra kind, caring, and open with each other.”\n\nThat day we didnt have any classes. We just watched the fire, watched the news, then we watch the collapse.

At one point we thought a missile was fired into the tower. We smelled the smoke and could see a haze in the distance. We couldn't see the tower directly cause there were tall buildings closer that blocked out the skyline at that angle, so we just waited for more news. \n\nEventually my mom showed up a little after our lunch break to take me home - she worked in downtown NYC and was on the opposite side of the tower but roughly the same distance as my school was . She had left work and took one of the last running trains - only for it to stop running between stops and they had to evacuate everyone on the train on foot through a dark subway tunnel, and then had to finish the walk on foot because the trains weren't running for obvious reasons. She had walked over the Brooklyn bridge on foot with thousands of other pedestrians, everyone freaking out and spewing out theories and information that was trickling in pre-smartphones. \n\nBy the time she got to my school she was a mess. As we walked out of the building, ill never forget as we walked out of the doors of the school, there was a security guard phone, and a woman was seated using the phone...she was covered in head to toe in thick white soot, kind of like a powdered donut. We walked all the home through the streets of Brooklyn in a daze, the entire city smell of smoke and a plume of visible smoke coming from Manhataan...it was a fucking nightmare.",

I’d never been in trouble before, and definitely nothing to get the attention of the principal, so me and my classmates were weirded out. She took me off to a back office of the cafeteria to tell me that “Your dad is ok, he’s been delayed in Chicago but he’s perfectly fine” then left, since I’m sure she was dealing with a lot of shit at the time.\n\n It from my point of view I was freaking out. My dad was flying from Memphis to I think Boston for a week long conference. He had left the previous night because his flight was so early the next day. I had no idea why my principal had to pull me to the side to tell me that he was ok. Turns out my sister had been watching the whole thing go down and called our mom freaking out some. Once my mom got confirmation from my dad that he was ok she called the school to talk to me and let me know along with my sister. She was allowed to talk to my sister but not me since the school was trying to minimize the information from all the super young kids. I just happened to be on the very cusp of that age block of being told.

I was between my sophomore and junior years in college. I was on a backpacking in Europe trip with a friend. I believe we were in Bordeaux having lunch at a cafe when the news broke. The waiter came up to us and said the Pentagon had been attacked and there was plane crash in New York. My friend and I were confused and thought the waiter must have been mistaken, \"What? The Pentagon? That's nowhere close to New York City. He must have misheard something.\" My friend found a pay phone and called her mom back home in Seattle. When she came back she said, \"It's really bad... we should go watch the news\". We went back to the hotel and were glued to the BBC after that watching footage of New York on repeat. The shot of the rubble pile and the cacophony chirping PASS (Personal Alert Safety System) alarms from fallen firefighters still haunts me.\n\nAfter the immediate shock wore off we realized we were going to have to figure out how we were going to get back home. Our flights back were  scheduled back to the US on Sept 17, but every flight across the board was canceled for the next few days. We were both poor college students and couldn't afford to stay much past the end of our scheduled trip date. We proceed on to Paris, but the mood was totally different from when had visited a few weeks prior. Every major monument had police out front guarding it with some serious firearms. I think 1 day before our scheduled departure they started opening up flight again. We ended up both being fortunate as our original reservations we booked didn't get canceled. \n\nMy flight from Paris ended up going directly over New York City. You could still see the smoke plumes rising from wreckage of the towers out the window of the plane. Everyone on the plane got real quiet when they saw that out the window. When we landed a few hours later everyone in the cabin clapped once the plane came to rest on the tarmac. Everyone who had a connecting flight, including myself, had to go back through security and have our luggage checked a second time.

So I started towards the door to go home and a guidance councilor stopped me and said I couldn't leave because they were talking about putting all the schools in the country on lockdown. I remember I said something to the effect of an institutional building like a small school in southern Indiana is unlikely to be attacked, and definitely more likely to be attacked than my house. He said nah you gotta stay. All people were doing was watching the tv and crying. I told him I wanted to go home and be with my family and he just kinda threw his arms up and walked off, so I just walked home and sat on the porch and watched people line up a mile and a half for $7.00 a gallon gas and thought about the selective service card I was forced to sign not too long before that.",

She saw his cellular # on caller ID at least twice:\n\n>Tom Burnett, a passenger on Flight 93, calls his wife Deena Burnett at their home in San Ramon, California. [Longman, 2002, pp. 106-107] **She looks at the caller ID and recognizes the number as being that of his cell phone.** She asks him if he is OK, and he replies: “No, I’m not. I’m on an airplane that’s been hijacked.” He says, “They just knifed a guy,” and adds that this person was a passenger. [Burnett and Giombetti, 2006, pp. 61] (According to journalist and author Jere Longman, this would likely have been Mark Rothenberg in seat 5B; Burnett was assigned seat 4B. Rothenberg is the only first class passenger who does not make a call from the flight. [Longman, 2002, pp. 107] \n\n(Later, from the summary of an FBI interview describing the 3rd call):\n\n>Approximately five minutes later she received another cell phone call from her husband. **BURNETT was able to determine that her husband was using his own cellular telephone because the caller identification showed his number**, [REDACTED]. \n\nInterview source: https://kapitalgate.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/2001-09-11-fbi-fd302-deena-lynne-burnett.pdf\n\nHowever, a 9/11 Commission memorandum states:\n\n>**The call Burnett made from the cell phone did not show up on the cell phone bill,** neither [sic] did the one he placed to his secretary before take-off.\n\nThe source is here: https://web.archive.org/web/20130207095711/http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00260.pdf\n\nMy question is, how does someone place a phone call to a billable number, only for that call to not show up on their bill? 🤔 The 9/11 Commission, the FBI and Deena all concede that she received at least one cell phone call (Deena says she received 4 cellphone calls, but she actually received 3). So why didn't the confirmed cellphone calls show up on Tom's account? Any answers?",

She had a habit of watching the news in the morning and then leaving the TV on. So, as I go to turn it off, I see the North Tower with smoke coming out. The actual impact site was on the other side of the Tower from the camera, so, as the son of a pilot, I immediately jumped to the wrong conclusion. The position of the Towers, and the way they were offset from each other, meant that during the morning breezes you got all kinds of weird gusts at the plaza level, which were sometimes strong enough to knock somebody down or even tip over a food truck. I figured some hot-shot rookie pilot told his girlfriend, “Watch for me , baby, I’m gonna fly by your office window and wave to ya!” (This stupid, and illegal enough for the FAA to ground you for life, but it still happened.) The rookie show-off got caught in a strange gust 100 yards from the building and was thrown into it before he knew what was happening. In my defense, let me just say that one of the anchors described the plane as a twin-engine prop. But just as I was phrasing in my head the jokes I would make with Dad, the second plane hit and the studio camera captured it live. There was no doubt that the strike was the intentional impact of an airliner. \nI had to get to work. We had big stuff planned for the day. When I got to my office I checked a website that reported Internet outages. The whole East Coast Internet was noticeably slower. First, millions of people were hitting news sites or checking on loved ones. Second, a big chunk of East Coast IP infrastructure had just gone offline. I went to the room where the programmers worked and told them what had happened, after which I called my parents. Mom spontaneously made the comparison to Pearl Harbor. Then the techs from our new ISP arrived, right on schedule, and we spent the rest of the morning on work. One of the ISP engineers said, “Well, we’re at war now.” But I wondered, “Against who?”",

I remember as a 17-18 year old kid who did many jobs at night and during the summer in WTC 1-2. Being on this higher floors was crazy. I remember on windy days those buildings shaking like they were designed to do. I was in Disney World on my first vacation with my new gf who is now my ex wife. It was our last day there and I was tired from all the walking so I just wanted to stay by the pool and relax. We got up around that time that it happened and for some reason I didn’t turn the tv on we just went to the pool right after waking up. We get there and we here this woman with a sort of British accent tell her friend about buildings collapse in NY. I looked at my gf and shook my head. We went back to the room and put on ESPN and saw the replays. I was in total shock. Thought this was a joke or something. It sounds so stupid but it’s exactly how I was processing this. All of a sudden my gf starts screaming that “my dad works there” and I just said no he doesn’t. Thing was she was in her own state of shock cause her dad moved to 34th & 8th from WTC 1 over 2 years before. I called all over back to NY and every line was either busy or it sounded like off the hook. Finally I got a hold of my sister in law and everyone was safe in my family. Disney didn’t charge us for any phone calls and we checked out and went to her grandmothers house who lived in Orlando. Getting a flight home or a train ticket was impossible. Our only way back to Brooklyn was a greyhound bus. It was 28 hours of pure hell. When we finally got to NJ and we got out to stretch and change drivers for the last leg to the Port Authority the smell of death was terrible. In my yard I had papers all over the place. Seeing all the posters of people missing taped all over my neighborhood Carroll Gardens made me realize that life as I knew it would never be the same. Remembering working in those high floors and thinking what the hell those people endured to this day make me sick. I had a few friends from my old job my neighborhood which is a very tight neighborhood if you know the area and high school who lost their lives. God bless all the people and their families who lost so much. \n9/11 Never Ever Forget 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸",
