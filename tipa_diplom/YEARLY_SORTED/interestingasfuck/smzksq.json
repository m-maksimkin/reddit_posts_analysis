Everyone is saying things like \"omg why they kill a fish üò≠üò≠üò≠\" or \"grrrr I hate money üò°\". First off, people are acting so supprised that people are eating the largest animal we can but then forget that that is what every other preditor does. Yes, I do think that we should not be eating endangered species but at the same time what do you expect?\n\n Then on top of that people are upset at the act of killing the fish itself. And I garentee you that all the people acting surprised at the sight of a dead fish are the same ones who eat chicken, beef, salmon etc. Honestly I prefer wild caught animals because I prefer my animals to not have lived in a sad, depressing state, only being born for a profit. The idea that the reason why my fish died is because it was simply at the wrong place at the wrong time sounds quite a bit better. \n\nAnd then the like 300 comments saying \"why you kill such a beautiful creature üò≠\" is idiotic. I'm assuming that their just for karma but still, why? Are you suggesting that every living animal isn't a beautiful miracle and proof that there is amazing in our universe? Yea the fish is an apex predator but it's just by simple evolution that it got there. There's a chance it could have been just large prey but it just so happened that eating other creatures was the most sustainable way for it to thrive. And honestly, it doesn't look like anything extraordinary. Just looks like a large fish to me ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø \n\nAnd I am not saying that we should fish endangered species but I am saying to stop acting like Hippocrates on the internet dude.\n\nI probably didn't make much sense and I'm probably gonna come back and cringe at this in a few years but eh I'm only 13 so idk what to expect.

Catching idk maybe 100lb yellowfin tuna on fishing trips to Baja Mexico as a teen with dad was an absolute marathon, they'd immediately dive straight down once hooked and you'd have to haul them back up 200+ feet with them fighting all the way - took me like 30-45 minutes  \nAbsolute torpedoes of solid muscle, I remember being amazed that even their eyes were smoothed and streamlined against the body for minimal drag   \nIt was basically impossible to fight them whilst they had their fresh strength even with the massive (\"penn senator\" I recall heavily) reels and rods we had, the best you could hope to do was limit the amount of line they pulled out and gained upon you untill they started to tire   \nWhiiiich mostly meant sitting there while the friction clutch on the reel went *whizzzzz* as the fish pulled out line in length  \nThen slooowly hauling their ass up from the depths with long rising lifts of the rod followed by reeling in on the way down  \nI remember being amazed at how far the rod could bend to help you pull at them without breaking - but you had to be careful not to be lax and let it touch against the edge of the boat because that would give the forces a focal point and could snap the rod\nAnd when you finally got them up to the surface and near your boat - your Mexican captain / guide would gaff them with a very sinister giant hook on the end of a pole and haul them aboard impaled, leaking red blood like mad  \nAnd into the fish hold they'd go for the rest of the day before we'd return back to the hotel / \"resort\"\nWe'd then be able to supply our that-day personally and freshly caught tuna to the kitchen staff of the resort to process and prepare, the sashimi and ceviche were absolutely amazing and unparalleled in my restaurant experience as I recall - and I'm not one to usually like fish at all  \nThe resort was *rancho leonero* by the way, I am happy to say they appear to still be in operation  \nI recall dad telling me they used to have an actual live lion chained out on the front lawn - hence the name  \nAnother last note that sticks with me - dad insisted that I have a knife in an easily accessible sheath on the side of my leg when we were out fishing - so that should I become tangled in the line and be dragged into the water I would at least have a *chance* of freeing myself from death.

If you placed it near a river, or some sort of fresh water source, that‚Äôd make sense. But you find yourself in the ocean, 20 ft waves, I‚Äôm assuming its off the coast of South Africa, coming up against a full, grown, 800 lb tuna with his 20 or 30 friends. You lose that battle. you lose that battle nine times out of ten. And guess what, you wandered into our school, of tuna and we now have a taste of blood!  We‚Äôve talked, to ourselves. We‚Äôve communicated and said, ‚Äòyou know what?  lion tastes good.  Lets go get some more lion.‚Äô We‚Äôve developed a system, to establish a beachhead and aggressively hunt you and your family. And we will corner your, your pride, your children, your offspring‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n**Terry** ‚Äì ‚ÄúHow ya gonna to do that?‚Äù\n\n**Allen** ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe will construct a series of breathing apparatus with kelp.

That will give us enough time to figure out where you live, go back to the sea, get more oxygen and then stalk you.  You just lost at your own game.
