It was a nightmare, first off all the busdrive took us 12 hours because of complications with both the bus and boat, I also couldn't fit in between my chair and the chair infront of me so my knee got stuck on the chair, which made me unable to put my feet on the ground. I can only imagine the person infront of me going insane because I was pretty mutch pushing the persons seat the entire time. \nYou can also only use the toilet x amount of times before it got full. It was full and we still had a 3 to 5 hour drive and I had to piss so badly. Once arrived I wanted to find a toilet asap, but no.. my girlfriend had to make some stupid ass pictures first with some typical red English phonebooth.\nHad to walk though London all day being tired feeling shit and telling about 5 homeless people \"no I don't have money\" \nAnd we still had to drive home, so with that being said I wish we had those seats.\n\nTl:dr 6'7\" guy in bus to London, 12 hour drive because of issues.

It‚Äôs for long trips and you get on at like 5pm or sometimes later and ride until morning from one city to the next. Typically they will come to a rest stop every few hours and around dinner time/lunch. \n\nProblem was when they had stopped for dinner, I was so hungry I ate 2 Banh Mi on the side of the road. Filled my tummy but at the same time, I wasn‚Äôt feeling it like immediately. Half an hour into the ride again, my tummy is in so much pain and I can feel I have explosive diarrhea coming. I don‚Äôt speak much Vietnamese so I tell my wife to ask the driver to make a stop somewhere because I really have to go. I remember she say something along the line of ‚ÄúChong em sap lam se no‚Äù which is something like my husband will make this bus explode. So the driver pulled over on the road, I ran up to the nearest house I see that has lights on and knock on their door. A woman opened the door and I asked to use her bathroom in as polite Vietnamese as I could and I swear, even though I butchered the language, she understood the meaning since I‚Äôm standing there with my knees together like the iconic Marilyn Monroe stance. \n\nI ran in and shut the door and I felt bad for the family that has to hear the ‚ÄúPfffftftfftt‚Äù, *flush*. ‚ÄúUghhhhhhhghhhhdjsksksn‚Äù *flush*. ‚ÄúHuhppphphhhh‚Äù *flush*. \n\nI thanked her and gave her 500,000 and hop back on the bus. I lay there for a few minutes and fell back into sleep afterward. Apparently the driver and his shift switch driver was talking about me all night. I was asleep the whole night but my wife heard the whole thing.\n\nYeah definitely not going to do it again, and if so, bring your own food/drinks.",
