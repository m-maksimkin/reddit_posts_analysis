Late to the party, but I want to share that **the title is 100% wrong.**\n\nDirect detections of exoplanets have been going on for many years- I've actually done research in following-up (natural) radio emission from such nearby systems, and we have several choices in directly imaged exoplanetary systems, much closer than this one! (No luck in detecting anything from the exoplanets, yet, but we can distinguish between detected emission from the star versus the planet so that's cool.) Instead what this is is the first directly imaged solar system *around a sun-like star*.  [The original source says this much.](https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2011/) Further, most of the sources in this image are *not* exoplanets but instead are background objects or artifacts- [here](https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso2011a/) are the ones that are the real ones.\n\nSo, still cool, but very misleading title!
