Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.\n\nThis lines up with the Foundations of Geopolitics.\n\n>Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because \"Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics\". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.[9]",

The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine. \n\n2. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. \n\n3. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to refrain from economic coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by Ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind. \n\n4. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used. \n\n5. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm, in the case of Ukraine, their commitment not to use nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, except in the case of an attack on themselves, their territories or dependent territories, their armed forces, or their allies, by such a State in association or alliance with a nuclear-weapon State. \n\n6. Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America will consult in the event a situation arises that raises a question concerning these commitments. \n\n— Memorandum on Security Assurances in Connection with Ukraine’s Accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n\n\nTL:DR It was not just Russia, but also USA, UK, then later joined by France and China.\n\nAlso, nukes were not given to Russia, but destroyed as they were not operable when soviet union fell.",

To transfer all nuclear warheads to Russia for destruction. In return for becoming a nonnuclear weapons state as a signatory of the Nonproliferation Treaty. Ukraine would get financial aid, economic assistance, and security assurances from the US, UK, France, China, and Russia. Recognizing Ukraine’s independence and sovereignty. Specifying its existing borders could only be changed only peacefully by mutual agreement. Two decades later Putin took Crimea and the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine. So, much for treaties with Russia. Might as well be with satan. \nIn August of 2005, Senators Obama and Lugar, toured a conventional weapons site in Donetsk. Met with then Ukrainian President Yushchenko, as part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. They felt the program should be expanded to include artillery, small arms, anti-aircraft weapons, and conventional ammunition. They later exclaimed the US should provide funds to destroy 400,000 small arms, 1,000 anti-aircraft weapons, and ammunition of all kinds. More than year later President GW Bush, signed it into law. Obama, later stated, The CTRP, “ has effectively disposed of thousands of weapons of mass destruction, but we must do far more to keep deadly conventional weapons like anti-aircraft missiles out of the hands of terrorists.” Most of the weapons weren’t scrapped but sold by the Yushchenko regime. In 2008 the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute reported between 2004 and 2007, the Ukrainian Export Control Service told the UN it sent 721, 777 small arms and light weapons to 27 different countries.

When Crimea was invaded I am sure many smaller countries looked on in horror, and this week solidified their resolve to acquire nuclear arms.\n\nAny country that is not thoroughly protected by a nuclear power, will see their only chance of survival in developing nuclear arms, as they have undeniable proof, in their eyes, that only nuclear weapons can deter invasions. \n\nThis is a terrible outcome. Nuclear arms races have been described as \"comparing how many matches you and your opponent have, while standing knee deep in oil\". One miss click, one faulty sensor, one poor decision, one misunderstood order, and you start a nuclear war. The USA and the USSR learned from close calls how to handle, and make safety measures, for a nuclear arsenal through way too many close calls, and even then I still doubt the current safety measures. What if tomorrow's nuclear power doesn't have a close call, but actually detonates their nuke?\n\nWith nuclear weapons buildup comes paranoia, and just a little scare could cause a nation to launch its entire arsenal.",

            "text": "TL;DR - Russia was always coming back. Ukraine did the right thing at the right time there, having no nuclear capability worth mentioning in a breath in comparison to Russia. Ukraine relied too heavily on (ultimately meaningless) NATO backing. We need to learn from this, and also past over-sanctifications from the last world wars. Russia will still be a world power without Putin.\n\nThe problem with those nations both who truly are, and who tout themselves as democracy's (and representative republics) is that their leadership changes against a relatively unchanging landscape of global leaders for life. If Russian president #3 agrees to X, Russian pres #4 will undo X and destabilize tenuous peace seeking lasting peace (through war of course, duh). \n\nI'm full willing to belive that this was a legitimate effort and intention at the time from Russia. Let's say it was; nobody has devalued their nuclear arsenal the way Russia has, the U.S. included. But, then Putin comes into power next and thinks differently. Does this agreement go away? Why bother to make it with a single individual? What's it worth if the people of Ukraine hold it in high regard but those in Russia fear it thanks to their newest regime orders and news stories? If regimes change we're beholden to no long-term plan. \n\nThere are those who will call Ukraine stupid or foolish for handing over weapons of such significance over a promise. Those same people who would HAVE to acknowledge the nuclear de-escalation that's been happening globally since the 80's, in the U.S., in China, but especially in Russia. \n\nI worry about the treatise of verslai 3.0 that will come from a new Russian regime. Fighting to gain global legitimacy after their overthrown government is overly punished. \n\nHow do we rehabilitate countries through legislation? How does one capture the GOOD Russian citizens in form others without seeming like a Russian propoganda bot themselves?\n\nI see machine learning and AI being implemented to give individuals threat and reliability ratings, but Black Mirror already did that, not to mention Facebook or indeed's social value effects. \n\nTo help those hurting, you must recognize that those causing pain are hurting too. To accept them. And, to strive through suffering to teach them the truth. Russia needs a path to redemption, not a condemnation. \n\n\nUkraine did the right thing here, but it was a gesture for others to put the pressure on Russia, not a one and done 'solved issue' and people were following suit to de-escalate on a reasonable timeline, especially considering they're dismantling the most powerful weapon ever created which their enemies have. Nuclear de-escalation is something we can all get behind. We need to focus on unifiers like this in the US nowadays. And, remember our past.",
