At first it looks like she's kissing him.  But he's on his back and his boots are drumming the concrete.\n* She turns.  With blood dripping from her mouth, she smiles showing teeth filed to points.  \n* In a quiet voice that somehow seems to echo around the warehouse she giggles, \"You idiots were too easy.  Isn't that right Jack?\"\n* There's a deafening bang on the door.\n* The lights flicker.\n* When the lights come on again, behind the woman is a mountain of a man.  Water drips from his torn fur garments.\n* He stands at least 7 feet tall.  His palm grips the handle of a grossly misshapen war hammer.  The head lays on the floor.  It looks too massive to move.\n* The woman stands.  She steps forward and climbs into the air as though she were climbing stairs.  \n* In that same quiet echo she says \"You take this room.  I'll handle the runners.\"\n* It was then the guy at the door realized his coworkers were screaming and leaving.\n* He looked back and saw a purple glow emanate from both the giant man's scarred hand and the massive head of the war hammer.\n* The man casually raised it over head and splattered the body of the man bleeding on the ground.\n* The guy at the door felt warmth splash on his face and he too began running.
