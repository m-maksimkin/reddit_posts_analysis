I wondered if homosexuality was just that prevalent in ancient Greece but then realized they were an elite force of the Theban army so they were specifically chosen.  The psychology seems smart (at least to my simple mind) after I read that Plato kind of started the idea by saying \"no man is such a craven that love cannot inspire him with a courage that makes him equal to the bravest born.\"  Basically saying you would fight the hardest and be least likely to abandon the fight with the person you love fighting at your side.  Makes sense to me but it is amazing to see that 2000+ years later we've demonized homosexuals in the military when they once held elite fighting posts.
