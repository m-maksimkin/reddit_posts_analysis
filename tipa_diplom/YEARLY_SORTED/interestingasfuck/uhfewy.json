And risk of injury is probably higher in 1932 because that long-horse was practically designed to cause athletes to Full Scorpion if they didn't clear it.\n\nNot to say that vault isn't a much cooler sport now, and safer, and better in every way - but the general physiology of human achievement hasn't significantly changed in the last 90 years: Olympic gold is still Olympic gold. If 100 years from now we decide vaulters should have jetpacks, the 2012 jump will remain no less impressive (nor the 1932).",
