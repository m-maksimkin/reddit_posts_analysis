In most states the permitting follows the property and if there was a failure of disclosures that’s a separate issue with the legal burden on you. \n\nDo your own permit review first if you want, but you should take these photos to an attorney and see what are the necessary steps to document the failure to disclose. Assuming all this was built without a permit (sure looks like it) this is still going to be on you to make the necessary renovations and inspections to bring it up to code before you sell but at least you can start a paper trail now to try to recover it from the person who sold it to you.\n\nGood luck lol you’ll need it.",

Solid concrete walls and ceiling as well.  It added about $55,000 to the cost of our house, so not too bad in the big picture.  The inside the walls access was the expensive part.

The city was divided into colored zones that were supposed to use specific evac routes. However, I noted that my section of town had no color evac route???\n\nI later asked the emergency response reps from the facility about it and what the deal was. Basically we were directly down the valley from the nearest facility, which was only a mile or so away. We were supposed to go to the basement and stay there for further instructions from the authorities.\n\nSo basically we lived in the 'kiss you a$$ goodbye' zone, also known as the 'we'll dig you out in 300 yrs when the radiation subsides' zone.",
