Я навіть не можу повірити, що роблю подібний пост, і він, ймовірно, буде похований, але якщо хтось має можливість перекласти його українською, будь ласка, зробіть це. Я воював в Іраку і був інструктором міської війни.\r  \n\r  \nДля захисників Києва я можу запропонувати кілька порад, які, можна сказати, працював в Іраку (на користь іракців):\r  \n\r  \n1.) Тримайтеся подалі.\r  \n\r  \n2.) Тримайтеся подалі на вулиці.\r  \n\r  \n3.) Заради Божої любові, тримайтеся подалі на вулиці. Найгірше місце в умовах міської війни – це бути на вулиці.\r  \n\r  \n4.) Двері називають «фатальною воронкою». У людській природі властиво намагатися увійти через двері. Направте всю свою зброю на двері, щоб збільшити кількість вбивств.\r  \n\r  \n5.) Заблокуйте двері зсередини чим завгодно, меблями, стільцями, мінами (вибухівкою). Ідея полягає в тому, щоб загарбники думали, що двері не заблоковані. Таким чином, коли вони намагаються увійти, вони залишаються відкритими протягом максимально тривалого часу.\r  \n\r  \n6.) Сходи – ще одна хороша зона вбивства. Блокуйте сходи будь-якими перешкодами, які ви можете, щоб уповільнити загарбників.\r  \n\r  \n7.) якщо ви кидаєте гранати вниз, тримайте магазин повністю зарядженим і готовим. Загарбники, швидше за все, піднімуться по сходах, щоб втекти від вибуху гранати. Вам знадобляться всі боєприпаси, щоб збити якомога більше.\r  \n\r  \n8.) Якщо можливо, виріжте невеликі отвори в підлозі в кімнатах нижче, щоб в них стріляти. Люди, які проникають у кімнати, шукають загрози прямо перед собою і зазвичай не дивляться вгору чи внизу до останнього.\r  \n\r  \n9.) Не накидайте зброю навколо тіла. Якщо справи йдуть рука об руку, це буде заважати вам.\r  \n\r  \n10.) Тримайте ніж, лопату або палицю поруч і легко доступні. Якщо вам доводиться битися рукопашний, це набагато зручніше, ніж гвинтівка.\r  \n\r  \n11.) Ніколи не стріляйте з одного вікна двічі.\r  \n\r  \n12.) Ніколи не висовуйте дуло рушниці за вікно. Не виставляйте це.\r  \n\r  \n13.) Стріляйте з глибини кімнати з вікна. Це допоможе приховати дульний спалах і зменшити шум, що ускладнює визначення, звідки він прийшов.\r  \n\r  \n14.) Якщо ви поранили ворога, не вбивайте його. Нехай його друзі прийдуть йому на допомогу. Переміщення пораненого солдата означає, що для його вилучення з бою знадобляться 4 людини. Це на чотири гвинтівки менше, що стріляють у вас.\r  \n\r  \n15.) Стріляйте в чоловіків, які намагаються евакуювати пораненого солдата. Це деморалізує їх і витягне з бою ще більше людей, щоб його евакуювати.\r  \n\r  \n16.) Тримайте якомога більше вуглеводів і не забувайте їсти та зволожувати. Міська війна неймовірно інтенсивна.\r  \n\r  \n17.) Продовжуйте рухатися. Ніколи не залишайтеся на одному місці дуже довго.\r  \n\r  \n18.) Один дуже влучний постріл може утримувати багато людей дуже довго. Не обов’язково бути снайпером. Ви просто повинні переконати їх, що в цьому районі є такий.\r  \n\r  \n19.) Використовуйте каналізацію в метро, ​​щоб рухатися, коли це можливо.\r  \n\r  \n20.) По можливості намагайтеся повідомляти іншим товаришам, де ви перебуваєте, щоб уникнути дружнього вогню. У міському середовищі дуже легко почати стріляти один в одного.\r  \n\r  \n21.) Це може бути важким, але вийміть трасери зі свого запасу боєприпасів і утримайтеся від їх використання.\r  \n\r  \n22.) мати один магазин усіх трасуючих патронів. Використовуйте цей журнал лише тоді, коли вам потрібно повідомити всім іншим (друзям), де знаходиться ворог. (Через вулицю, в парку, яке вікно). Після використання бігайте як у пекла та втечіть від того, де ви щойно були.\r  \n\r  \nЯ не знаю, що ще написати, і я сподіваюся, що нікому з вас ніколи не доведеться цим користуватися. Бог з усіма вами. Мене як людину з українським походженням розриває, що я не можу бути з тобою.\r  \n\r  \nСлава Україні.\r  \n\r  \nРедагувати: кілька додаткових.\r  \n\r  \n23.) Боєприпаси йдуть швидко. Бережіть те, що маєте.\r  \n\r  \n24.) 10 чоловік, що стріляють з кількох різних будівель, можуть здатися невеликою армією і зупинити багато людей.\r  \n\r  \n25.) Зривайте дорожні знаки, спотворюйте назви будівель і робіть усе, щоб позбутися ідентифікації того, де ви перебуваєте. Це додасть замішання сил вторгнення.\r  \n\r  \n26.) Своєчасно евакуюйте поранених.\r  \n\r  \n27.) якщо ворог раптово відступить, ГІДАЙТЕСЯ З РАЙОНИ. Це не означає, що ви виграєте. Це означає, що вони збираються викликати і важку артилерію або авіаудар по вашій позиції.\r  \n\r  \n28.) якщо ви збираєтеся втратити територію, отруйте звичайні запаси води. Швидше за все, ворог спробує поповнити свої запаси в найближчому джерелі.\r  \n\r  \n29.) Згрупуйте свої міни-пастки в безпосередній близькості, щоб створити параної.\r  \n\r  \n30.) Завжди залишайтеся в русі. Ніколи не залишайтеся довго на одному і тому ж місці.",

The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside.\n\n4.\t⁠Doors are called “the fatal funnel.” It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills.\n\n5.\t⁠Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives). The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn’t blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible.\n\n6.\t⁠Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders.\n\n7.\t⁠If you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You’ll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible.\n\n8.\t⁠When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don’t look above or below until last\n\n9.\t⁠Don’t sling your weapon around your body.

It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from.\n\n14.\t⁠If you wound an enemy, don’t kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That’s four less rifles firing at you.\n\n15.\t⁠Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him.\n\n16.\t⁠Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive.\n\n17.\t⁠Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long.\n\n18.\t⁠One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don’t have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area.\n\n19.\t⁠Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible.\n\n20.\t⁠Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It’s very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment.\n\n21.\t⁠It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them.\n\n22.\t⁠Have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends) know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window). After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were. I don’t know what else to write, and I hope to God none of you ever have to use it. God be with you all. As someone with Ukrainian ancestry it tears me apart to not be able to be there with you. Glory to Ukraine.\n\n23.\t⁠Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have.\n\n24.\t⁠10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people.\n\n25.\t⁠Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force.\n\n26.\t⁠Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible.\n\n27.\t⁠If the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn’t mean you’re winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position.\n\n\n28.\t⁠Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia.\n\n29.\t⁠Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long.\n\nI am not the original creator of this, simply found it and the need to spread it to other posts.",
