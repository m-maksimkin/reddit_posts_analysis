It is almost certainly a joke on the part of the artisan who carved it; mediaeval masons and wood carvers were prone to such humour, often at the expense of local personalities. Another example is the famous Lincoln Imp in the cathedral there, who now has his own folklore story. Now easily accessible due to installation of an upper floor to the restaurant, when originally carved, the rude man would have been difficult to spot. A theory is that it is the wood carver himself, getting revenge for non payment for his work at the church.\n\n \n\nThe original church was built in 1200 but soon fell down, possibly following an earthquake. The new church was started soon after, and completed in 1330. The tower and spire quickly developed a list due to the foundations being laid close to one or more rubbish pits. It was straightened in the 1990s, but a further twist in the spire was created by metal fastenings rusting, causing stones to be pushed out of place. After extensive repairs and restoration during the 1990s, the church re-opened in 1997. Today they run a successful restaurant in the church.",

Opening and closing the flute was no use. The customer looks up into the chimney and sees nothing blocking the opening. Just open sky. Baffled by this, he pays the Mason the original amount agreed on. And Begs him to come fix it.\nThe Mason climbed to the top and dropped a brick into the chimney shattering a peice of glass he put in during earlier construction of the chimney.\n\nI guess it was fairly common for masons to do this just in case they didn't get paid? \nPretty tricky.\nWhen the customer couldn't get the chimney to work properly he looks inside and up and looks right through the glass.

Killingholme was the smaller of the two villages and so they did not have a church like Immingham did.\nOne day, the villagers in Killingholme decided that they would like a church of their own, and so they began work to build one. However, the villagers found that they couldn’t finish it one their own. They decided to ask the people of Immingham for help. The people of Immingham gladly helped the villagers and soon the new church was completed.\n\nA few years later, there was a terrible storm and the church in Immingham was struck by lightning and damaged. The next morning the people of Immingham inspected the damage. They decided it was so bad that they would have to ask for help repairing it, so they asked the villagers in Killingholme for help. \n\nThe villagers, however, refused to return the favour they had been granted a few years earlier. The people of Immingham were left to fix their church on their own. \n\nEventually they had repaired the damage, but the villagers of Killingholme had annoyed them greatly. They decied to stick a gargoyle on top of the bell tower, with its naked backside pointed toward Killingholme. The gargoyle can still be seen today.",
