Same with addictions, you have built all these pathways that connect the drug to other things like driving, eating, etc, so when you are trying to get off the drug you will keep wanting the drug when you drive, eat, etc.  Its very important to keep in mind that you arnt just \"stopping\" the drug, you have to let these pathways die off. And the only way to do that is to consistently not supply them with energy (doing the drug while doing the thing). So eat, and dont do the drug, causes the pathway to shrivel up a little more each time you do it, and over time the pathways literally die off.   This is why most people cant quit drugs cold turkey, the pathways are too active and need to be neglected.",
