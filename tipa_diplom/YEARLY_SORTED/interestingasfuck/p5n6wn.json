There will be no real way to take in all these people and do so safely. \n\nNot to mention we have more homeless people here already and those without work than any anytime in recent history. So even if you ignore the national security implications, which are massive and can’t be understated, we also have to look at prioritizing American “refugees” who had their lives, businesses, family, etc. destroyed over the past year and a half. \n\nIf anyone thinks we should just take in tens of thousands of these refugees blindly, even ignoring the national security threat they pose, they should watch this video about how doing so actually makes things worse overall and doesn’t make a difference in a positive way. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE",

Trillions spent, yep.   Vietnam parallels, absolutely.   These are all hindsight perspectives that are easy.

Feels good knowing that you would never make these terribly immoral decisions, right?  What about now?  What would YOU do NOW?  Would you send in troops now to allow more Afghanis to emigrate to the U.S.?   Would you justify your decision on the inevitable and let history repeat…I mean it is Afghanistan.  \n\nTo be fair, I don’t know the right answer(s), but I CAN’T STAND the righteous indignation that comes from those that can only see right and wrong in hindsight.  \n\nGrow up and put your decision on what to do next out there for the karma farm, or future you,  to judge.\n\nSoap box over.

They got out on a plane.\n\nGrandpa on my dad’s side was a smaller landowner. Not so lucky. Didn’t give up the land and took a bullet on it. Dad and the rest of his families were sent to the killing fields. Dad was stuck working the farms for nearly 5 years before he made a break for it through the minefields and jungles to a refugee camp over the Thai border. Managed to make it to the US eventually.\n\nIts an odd thing. Dad fully knows the US basically abandoned them over there, but he still thinks the US is the best country in the world.

But it’s usually women and children first.\n\nBut perhaps these were interpreters and other Afghans who helped the US so they’d be predominantly male just due to the norms in that region. I hope it’s not a case where there are thousands of women who want to flee but can’t because they cannot find a male escort (which I believe is a requirement to leave home in the Taliban-controlled areas). So much suffering. Awful. \n\nIt’s heartbreaking to see so many people fleeing and so forth. The I’m sure they vastly outnumber the Taliban douchebags.
