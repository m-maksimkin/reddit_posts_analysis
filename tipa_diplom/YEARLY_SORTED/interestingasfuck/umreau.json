Very thin, they will fill that cavity completely in a matter of days in the right conditions.  Quickly fill it with brood, and then swarm, spreading their genetics to more locations.  \n\nThe sooner you remove them, the easier the relocation.  They protect brood and food, they move in with none of either.  They are converting the honey they are collecting into wax right now to build a home.
