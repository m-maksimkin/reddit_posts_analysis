After initial flash, try to measure the fireball with your thumb, if the fireball is bigger than your thumb, you need to find cover fast.\n\n3. Find a ditch, any ditch, and launch yourself into it, keep you arms and legs locked at your side. And pray to God.\n\n4. The shockwave is extremely powerful, if you lift your head, your neck will snap. If you stand up you will disintegrate. Odds are your already dead.\n\n5. IF.... you survive your main priority, above all else, is finding a building with concrete structure. The thicker the concrete the better. If you find a concrete basement that the safest. Do not drink anything, do not eat anything.\n\n6. Find a radio, any radio and wait for the government to brief you. If the government still stands, they will eventually come for you. \n\n7. Do not use conditioner. Radiation bonds to it. It's impossible to get out once it's bonded. It's a one way ticket to death.\n\n8. Soap, not even shampoo. Soap is best.\n\n9. Do not leave your base, you've just survived, but there is no guarantee anyone else has. You need to stay put.\n\n10. You've just survived a nuclear holocaust. You will have PTSD, you will have burns, you will be malnourished, you will be alone. And it's theorized that it could take weeks for help to come. Not to mention the fallout afterwards. And I haven't even gotten to nuclear winter. You won't be the same person afterwards and you have a 80% chance of dying from cancer.\n\nIt truly is the worst way to die\n\nEdit: who ever awarded me, thank you. It means a lot, if I can help someone with this I've done my job. Much love everyone üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nYou guys are legends. Thank you so much üôÇ\n\nEdit Edit: for the people who need to hear this. You honestly are beautiful people. I'm not doing this to scare anyone. But you deserve to know the truth. And there are people contributing also. Which I seriously think is beautiful. Thanks again my friends üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nEdit Edit Edit: for all you trolls that think I'm lying. I studied for 3 years in a army course just to understand the effects of radiation and fallout. I'm by no means a expert and yes I do admit I'm getting a bit rusty with it. It was a while ago. But I'm only trying to help people. Not scare them. Grow up and actually learn something. I'm only trying to help you.\n\nI've never been so hurt. People are actually throwing doubt about my service. Like you would know. I can prove it. Away with you\n\nTo clear it up. These people saying \"YoU NeEd MiNImUm 11 YeArs To BeComE Sergeant\" your speaking the biggest amount of bullshit I've ever heard come out of someone's mouth. No you don't. Like I said. I earned it.

That's when a massive heatwave pushes out and sets the living green plants you see around you on fire. Inhale any of that air and you just cooked your mouth, thoat and lungs. \n\n\nGet in the water?

You might be okay. \n\n\n\nSo you somehow managed to stay alive for several minutes. Everything is on fire around you. By whatever grace something is keeping you alive. You need to run. Upwind.

You'll need clean food and water for that time. \n\n\n\nIt's just one nuke, our stupid leaders managed to stop further self destruction?\n\n\nYou'll need to be seen by medical and make sure you're not suffering from any kind of radiation sickness.

Within a few years due to nuclear winter, the spreading of radiation around the world, stupid people who were rich and had no skills to survive lived and are now fighting one another because they are now just poor people relying on the good grace of whatever they have until it breaks, most life on earth will die. \n\n\nMaybe intelligent life will evolve again before the sun goes super Nova but that's not likely from what I've been able to figure out.

You'll hear about heat and pressure, the fireball that continues expanding, exploding, and literally crushing and burning everything in it's path.\n\nBut what you won't hear about is the immediate aftereffect, the vacuum created when that fireball suddenly contracts.

            "text": "I see a lot of misconceptions on what would happen/what you should do in real life.\n\n1. You will likely not self combust. The incineration zone is actually quite small; if you‚Äôre in that and you‚Äôre outside or in a poor shelter, then yes, you‚Äôll be vaporized. Not 100%, but 99% true. Some in Hiroshima survived right inside the incineration zone by being inside sturdy concrete structures. Now, outside this is a much bigger 3rd degree burn zone. Obviously, the heat decreases with distance. If you are some km away, and you do not expose yourself to open air, you will not self combust like in Terminator. Stay in your basement, or if outside, shelter in a ditch. Basically, don‚Äôt just stand there looking at the explosion, and your odds are not that bad if you are a few km away. \n\n2. You are not going to immediately die of radiation. You have a 10-15 minute window from the detonation until fallout starts raining down. You need to find a shelter before then. If you‚Äôre outside still when it‚Äôs coming down, you will likely die a slow, painful death from radiation. But if you manage to get inside, remove all clothing and store somewhere people won‚Äôt be around (hint it‚Äôs radioactive clothing now). Take a shower with soap, NO conditioner (makes radiation tick to your hair), or wipe yourself off with a rag and water as best you can. \n\n3. Where should you shelter? Ideally a fallout shelter. Anything else offers poor protection. There are 3 types of radiation you need to worry about: alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha and beta can be blocked by thin materials, but gamma is the one that goes through steel, lead, and concrete. Every material has a property called halving-distance; the thickness of material needed to reduce gamma radiation by 1/2. For lead it‚Äôs something like 6 cm if i remember correctly. Now, a proper fallout shelter needs 10 halving thicknesses of whatever material its built with. This reduces gamma radiation levels by 2^10 (i.e. gamma rad reaching you will be 0.097% of full outside amount). So for lead, you‚Äôd want 60 cm thick walls and ceiling. Sounds crazy right? But it gets worse; your basement is poor shelter because the floor of your house is likely wood/concrete and definitely not thick enough. Still, it‚Äôs better than most other places. You won‚Äôt get 10 halving thicknesses, but maybe 5 (i.e. amount of gamma rad reaching you will be 3.125%). Just seal off windows and ideally filter the air supply to the basement. Folks in trouble will be the ones with no basement (apartments). Windows will be blown out for km around, and there will be no way to stop fallout getting in. Best you can do is hope your apartment has some kind of basement or deep underground garage. \n\n4. Most experts say it will take about 2 weeks before it‚Äôs safe to go outside. Plan to be self sufficient for that time. Don‚Äôt go outside at all until then, you will die very slowly and painfully. Consider your needs; food, water, waste disposal, self-protection. Your shelter should be equipped ahead of time. If you lack those when it comes to it, you‚Äôre likely also fucked. \n\n5. The world you come out to will be a nightmare. Your neighbourhood; rubble. Your city; rubble. Buildings, collapsed, with thousands lying dead in the streets. Emergency services; gone. Hospitals? Destroyed, flooded with the dying, and completely unable to offer any feasible treatment for radiation and burns. Government in all likelihood non-existent, or unable to reach you. Food and water stocks contaminated or diminishing. Electronics disabled by the blast‚Äôs EMP. Every comfort of modern life will be gone. Oh, and nuclear winter. A lot of the super doomsday stuff is from the 80s, when computer models weren‚Äôt as advanced as they are now. It‚Äôs doubted now that temperatures would drop by 40 degrees or what have you. However, it‚Äôs still not a rosy picture either. A 2021 study on a nuclear war between the US and Russia posited that mean temperatures around the globe will drop by 10 degrees celsius for at least 2 years, and the effects will still be felt for a decade. Rainfall will also be severely lessened in some areas. To sum it up, you will likely be living in some kind of pre/early Industrial Era state. Electricity will probably come back at some point, but will be severely limited. Most people will die off of starvation or cold afterwards, and the human population will fall back to pre-modern levels (i.e. billions will die). \n\nI hope this helped paint a clearer picture of what you can expect if the worst comes to pass.",

He also described the heat as well, something similar to being out on a hot summer day with no water, getting that crispness in the face from dehydration and cracked lips.. other had singe hairs including no eyelashes. Others lost eyesight. Over the years many of the soldiers died from cancer in some form of way. The few lucky, I think, 12 or 11 managed to either get surgery just before it got worse or were managing what they had.\n\nWhat really got me with this is the one vet who was speaking had been in several battles, killed several men, been shot at and had small explosives go off next to him and when speaking about the situation, he was crying.",

It might but that would require a massive amount of heat energy and while an Atom bomb or in this case I think its an H bomb is occurring, it appears the ground zero is several miles away from the observer. A 1MT bomb would give only first degree burns at 7 miles, 3rd degree burns at 5 miles. I‚Äôm gonna work on the calculations as best I can.\n\nEdit: I did some math. The time from the initial ignition to the shockwave impacting the observer is ~17 seconds. At 75 degrees F, the speed of sound is traveling at 1,133.25 feet/second. The shockwave travels at the speed of sound so it traveled 19,265.25 feet before hitting the observer. That means ground zero is 3.65 miles away. If this is a 1 Megaton bomb, that would land somewhere between second and third degree burns to exposed flesh. Third degree burns occur around 131 degrees farenheit. The ignition point of live plant matter is around 400-600 degrees C. That would be nearly quadruple the temp of what we‚Äôre seeing. I don‚Äôt think plant matter that far would ignite. My math is based on a few assumptions mostly the yield of the bomb.",

If it decays to roughly 340m/s (there's a hell of an initial impulse), that nuke was within approximately 6km , and we may actually be closer to 7km accounting for the initial burst. With nuclear weapons, its really horseshoes and hand grenades for close counts. If it missed bullseye by a kilometer because of CEP (Circular Error Probable) for a myriad of variable reasons, it still pasted its target unless you are a dictator dug into your doomsday bunker.\n\nLet's say it's a \"current\" weapon, a 750kt MIRV, which R-36M2 Voevoda (SS-18 Mod 5) will carry 10 of, which can get dialed up to 1MT if they are feeling particularly vicious. At that 750kt yield, the surface burst's thermal pulse sufficient enough to ignite dry wood would reach out to that approximate 6km standoff distance between the viewer and ground zero. I did the calc for a smaller 550kt weapon you can expect to be deployed from their boomers (Ballistic Missile Submarines), and the effects won't be quite as severe obviously, but we the viewers would still be fucked.\n\nThe overpressure effect at that range would be between 2.5PSI and 3PSI. 1PSI for reference is where glass begins to shatter, and 3PSI is where residential buildings are expected to start collapsing, while stronger structures (Concrete & Rebar) will start feeling it at 5PSI. Three Little Pigs in the modern age, really.\n\nAssuming that this took place in the Pacific Ocean, where the average wind speed over the ocean is 15km/h, then roughly 758(\\^)2 kilometers is going to catch 1000 Rads/Hour when the fallout hits. Even if you were completely upwind, you are still in the contour for 10 Rads/Hour of exposure if you've survived both the Thermal and Physical pulses and haven't found cover.\n\nTL;DR You. Are.
