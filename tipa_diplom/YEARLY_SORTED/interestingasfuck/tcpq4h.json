You can't start a riot alone, because then you'll be caught. But if a lot of people are ready for a riot, then they can start one.\n\nOrganisation doesn't happen with leaders, since the leaders will get arrested before they can organise. Organisation happens through people ambiguously signalling that they're ready to riot, then the police will be outnumbered.\n\nA blank piece of paper can mean \"I might be ready to participate in a revolution\". If you see enough pieces of paper, it's time to throw a stone and start the riot. This often happens when some event triggers it (a disaster, or police brutality, or England wins / loses a football match).\n\nPutin is losing a war (or at best winning it in a way that makes Russia look very weak). The economy is getting destroyed. He's purging people at the top. I'm sure enough people want a coup d'etat, and everyone suspects that there's the will and numbers, but no-one wants to move first without judging whether there is actually support.\n\nThis is also a coordination problem. You can't communicate, because there might be a snitch.\n\nThe solution to a coordination problem is ambiguous signals. Disrespecting Putin in ways that are subtle and ambiguous. Watching for other people doing the same, or whether there's a sense that everyone else is being a bit off. Normally Putin would detect it, but it's hard to do so if you're hiding in a bunker. And the snitches won't be sure (not that there will be many, who wants to support a guy who is going to either trash the country or end up getting deposed). And if a lot of people are doing it, there's safety in numbers.\n\nMaybe they could even do it to his face in the meetings. He's not there in person, and he doesn't know how people normally talk, so they could just do a bit of a silly voice (changing their accent a bit, or talking a little higher or lower than usual). He wouldn't really know how people normally talk (since he's hiding in a bunker and getting a bit crazy I think), and no-one would be sure whether it's intentional (or just a bit of nerves because of meeting the boss) but people in the room will get a sense that something is off, especially if a few people are doing it.\n\nThen make a feint. Attack some idea that is kind of Putin-esque but not actually Putin's when he's not paying attention. How many people side with you?\n\nThen start with the body language or interruptions to his face. Accidently cut him off as he starts to speak. Glance around the room while he is talking. Nothing big, but do other people join in? At this point he knows something might be coming, but you have a good idea of whether there's the numbers, or whether you apologise and just take whatever he dishes out.\n\nHe knows it's coming anyway. That's why he's purging people (possibly just at random, or for imagined slights, or because the Russian elites already know all this and it's what they're doing). And they know he knows.\n\nThen there's a trigger. A battle is lost. A casual nuke gets tossed and NATO gets mad. There's a natural disaster. There's a big riot in the streets. His cleaner trips over the wifi in an important meeting. Who knows, but the powder keg suddenly gets lit.",

I asked him about how he was doing over there, only to realise my reasonable friend was long gone. He started talking about the war, and it shocked me that he was full on pro-putin. He mentioned how this is all a hoax and how well they prepared for the \"operation\" to take down damm nazis over Ukraine. There I was thinking I knew him.. I told him yeah, like that was bound to happen. it's not like US would sit still if they put nukes on Canada pointed out to them, but then he thought I was pro Russia and kept on going.
