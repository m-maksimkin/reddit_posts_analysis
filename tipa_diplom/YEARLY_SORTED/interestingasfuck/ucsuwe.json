With these, they managed to beat back the Rus‚Äô and sink a significant portion of the Rus‚Äô navy. \n\nThe Rus‚Äô were not completely ejected from the country though, and they pillaged cities to the south and east of the capital, committing many atrocities along the way. \n\nI‚Äôm hoping the eerie similarities don‚Äôt end there. \n\nAs the Rus‚Äô were about to return home with their spoils of war, the resistance caught up with them and decimated what remained of the Rus‚Äô forces. \n\nOne of the outcomes of that war was that the Rus agreed not to invade Crimea. \n\nThe leader of the Rus‚Äô died shortly thereafter, when, get this, he had his legs tied to two separate trees that were bent over, then they untethered the trees, sending the legs in two different directions, ending his reign. His death was blamed on his excessive greed.",
