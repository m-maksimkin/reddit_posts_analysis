I don't have a very solid opinion about this, but I just wanted to suggest a few things to consider...\n\nYes, Sea World keeps wild animals in captivity and makes money off making them perform. It's easy to call that out as a bad thing, but it seems more nuanced than that. I've known a lot of animal trainers and most that I've met seem to genuinely care about the animals that they train. Also, couldn't places like Sea World also be responsible for some of the human empathy towards these animals? As in, you might never have had the chance to be up close to them and see them in a different light than just a wild apex predator. In order words, what would the public perception of orcas be if places like Sea World would have never existed?\n\nAnother thing is that I notice that reddit seems to have no issue pointing out when humans are being assholes, but seldomly extends that possibility to the animal kingdom. Is it possible that part of the reason this particular orca killed 3 people is because it might be a bit of a jerk? I remember hearing Jane Goodall talk recently about a problematic ape that she was studying in Africa. The interviewer was trying to get her to talk about why he acted the way he did, and her answer was basically that he was kind of an asshole. He just did shitty things regardless of how nice he was treated. She really didn't have anything good to say about the ape and I don't know that there are many more people on this planet that care more about animals in general than Jane Goodall.\n\nAnyway, just trying to say that maybe the humans aren't always the bad guys...or at least not ALL the humans. I like to think that most of us are a mixed bag and maybe just demonizing this particular group of people is over-simplifying it a bit.",

Worst thing was she said was that they only like 3-5 years in the wild so sea world is actually doing them a favor.

After that he transferred to sea world where he was forced to perform and force-bred until his slow death from bacterial pneumonia.  \n\nOrcas are extremely intelligent- to the extent of having culture and language they pass to their offspring.  Their language is so complex that different groups of whales can accurately be said to have accents and dialects. Orcas are known to grieve when one of their members is hurt/captured, and pods will commonly follow capture boats for many miles. They have also been observed isolating themselves, refusing food, and making specific noises associated with grieving after the loss of a pod member. An intelligent and social animal such as this should not be in captivity. \n\nTilikum was extremely psychologically damaged and traumatized, and acted out violently, as would a human being who was captured and abused since childhood.   The trainer's deaths were tragic, it was incredibly dangerous for sea world to force a large, intelligent, and mentally unstable animal to continue to perform when it was abundantly clear that his behavior was unpredictable.

But this is weak logic. Orcas aren't humans, and many species of mammals do very well in captivity, living longer and happier lives than their wild counterparts, given that they have sufficient socialization and stimulation. Their needs are not the same as ours. Also, these attacks are rare and unpredictable -- even this particular whale didn't harm anyone for 19 years (save for a stranger who climbed into the tank after sneaking in after hours). Literally tens of thousands of harmless interactions with humans had passed prior to the 2010 attack. Hindsight is 20-20 here. \n\nI'll reiterate that we shouldn't keep orcas in captivity, and that SeaWorld was negligent in the treatment of this whale and its caregivers.

The three whales submerged her, dragging her around the pool and preventing her from surfacing.\\[12\\] At one point, she reached the side and tried to climb out, but the whales pulled her back into the pool. Other trainers threw her a life-ring, but the animals kept her away from it, ignoring the trainer's recall commands.\\[18\\] She surfaced three times before drowning, and it was several hours before her body could be recovered from the pool.\\[19\\]\\[20\\]\\[21\\]\\[22\\]\\[23\\]\r  \n\r  \nTilikum was moved to SeaWorld Orlando on January 9, 1992.\\[24\\] Sealand of the Pacific closed soon afterward.\\[25\\]\r  \n\r  \nSecond death\r  \nOn July 6, 1999, a 27-year-old man, Daniel P. Dukes, was found dead over Tilikum's back in his sleeping pool.\\[26\\] Dukes had visited SeaWorld the previous day, stayed after the park closed, and evaded security to enter the tank unclothed. An autopsy found numerous wounds, contusions, and abrasions covering his body, and his genitals had been bitten off,\\[27\\]\\[28\\] all allegedly caused by Tilikum.\\[29\\] Despite numerous cameras around and inside the pool that are supposed to monitor the well-being of the whales, SeaWorld claims the event was not captured.\\[30\\] The autopsy concluded that Dukes' cause of death was drowning. The medical examiner reports that no drugs or alcohol were found in Dukes' system.\\[3\\]\\[29\\]\\[31\\]\\[32\\]\r  \n\r  \nThird death\r  \nMain article: Dawn Brancheau\r  \nOn February 24, 2010, Tilikum killed Dawn Brancheau, a 40-year-old trainer.\\[33\\]\\[34\\] Brancheau was killed following a Dine with Shamu show. The veteran trainer was rubbing Tilikum as part of a post-show routine when the killer whale grabbed her by her ponytail and pulled her into the water.\\[35\\]\\[36\\]\\[37\\] Some witnesses reported seeing Tilikum grab Brancheau by the arm or shoulder.

An autopsy found numerous wounds, contusions, and abrasions covering his body, and **his genitals had been bitten off**,\\[27\\]\\[28\\] all allegedly caused by Tilikum. **Despite numerous cameras around and inside the pool that are supposed to monitor the well-being of the whales, SeaWorld claims the event was not captured.**\n\n**2010**: Tilikum killed Dawn Brancheau, a 40-year-old trainer.\\[33\\]\\[34\\] Brancheau was killed following a Dine with Shamu show.

The orcas were valid in killing those who were torturing them, whereas my other examples were cases of the human/parent absolutely being to blame for the death of the animals, because of their own shite qualities. It's exactly the same thing, but because those animals aren't attracting nearly the same amount of people, they're put down because they're seen as a liability to keep around due to the negative press. And you can see a tiger in most zoos, so who cares if a few dies due to the reckless behavior of shit people? Orcas on the other hand are rare in captivity (for good reason), so they're worth keeping around, despite the outcry every time their welfare is brought into question when they kill someone.",

It seems pretty clear that these animals should not be kept in captivity or bread in captivity for entertainment or for our alleged \"learning.\"  Are there any valid reasons related to conservation for having a whale in captivity? I'm thinking of situations like where the San Diego zoo has some of the last of certain types of rhinos in order to keep them safe so that the species isn't poached out of extinction. Or would that never be reasonable for whales? Same question as to a whale that is injured: if it would have died in the wild is it better to let it? Or is it better to try to \"save\" it by raising it in captivity?\n\nGenuinely not trying to play devil's advocate: I'm not a biologist and my current knowledge about this topic is limited.

The three whales submerged her, dragging her around the pool and preventing her from surfacing. At one point, she reached the side and tried to climb out, but the whales pulled her back into the pool. Other trainers threw her a life-ring, but the animals kept her away from it, ignoring the trainer's recall commands. She surfaced three times before drowning, and it was several hours before her body could be recovered from the pool.\r  \n\r  \nTilikum was moved to SeaWorld Orlando on January 9, 1992. Sealand of the Pacific closed soon afterward.\r  \n\r  \n**Second death**\r  \nOn July 6, 1999, a 27-year-old man, Daniel P. Dukes, was found dead over Tilikum's back in his sleeping pool. Dukes had visited SeaWorld the previous day, stayed after the park closed, and evaded security to enter the tank unclothed. An autopsy found numerous wounds, contusions, and abrasions covering his body, and his genitals had been bitten off, all allegedly caused by Tilikum. Despite numerous cameras around and inside the pool that are supposed to monitor the well-being of the whales, SeaWorld claims the event was not captured. The autopsy concluded that Dukes' cause of death was drowning. The medical examiner reports that no drugs or alcohol were found in Dukes' system.\r  \n\r  \n**Third death**\r  \nMain article: Dawn Brancheau\r  \nOn February 24, 2010, Tilikum killed Dawn Brancheau, a 40-year-old trainer. Brancheau was killed following a Dine with Shamu show. The veteran trainer was rubbing Tilikum as part of a post-show routine when the killer whale grabbed her by her ponytail and pulled her into the water. Some witnesses reported seeing Tilikum grab Brancheau by the arm or shoulder. He reportedly scalped her then bit off her arm and swallowed it during the attack. Brancheau's autopsy indicated death by drowning and blunt force trauma.\r  \n\r\n\nHelped kill 1, presumably killed another, and *definitely* killed the 3rd.",
