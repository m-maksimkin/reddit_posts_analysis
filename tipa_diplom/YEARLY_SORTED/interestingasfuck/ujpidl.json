You decide :D\n\nBtw I think the most complicated valid character you can type on Reddit is 龘, a flying dragon.\n\nEdit: choice of words and pronunciation\nAlso these “prefix” are actually radicals! I just thought “prefix” might be easier to understand.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the awards! I tried answering some questions, but definitely check out other sources (there’s a Wikipedia page for biang biang mien!) about this character and this awesome language.

Does the extra effort make you more analytical and precise or are Latin languages allow for more rapid dispersal of information over short lengths of time? Or does it all equal out because Latin/Cyrillic symbols must be used in succession to create a word whereas a lot of languages like this are conveying a whole word or even words with 1 symbol?\n\nSay you are completely proficient in both English and Japanese and you HAVE to handwrite something fast like medical or cooking instructions, which would be the quickest and easiest choice? I could be wrong, but it seems like there's less room for error in these symbols than say misspelling heart or heat and still getting the point. The being said I'm sure Japanese like other languages also has shorthand too.

In one version of the story, the character biáng was invented by the Qin Dynasty Premier Li Si. However, since the character is not found in the Kangxi Dictionary, it may have been created much later than the time of Li Si. Similar characters were found used by Tiandihui.  \n>  \n>In the 2007 season of the TVB show The Web (一網打盡), the show's producers tried to find the origin of the character by contacting university professors, but they could not verify the Li Si story or the origin of the character. It was concluded that the character was invented by a noodle shop.  \n>  \n>One hypothesis is that there was no such character or meaning for this word in the beginning, and the word actually came from the sound people make from chewing the noodles, \"biang biang biang\".  \n>  \n>A legend about a student fabricating a character for the noodle to get out of a biangbiang noodle bill also is a commonly believed hypothesis about the origin of the character.  \n>  \n>According to a China Daily article, the word \"biang\" is an onomatopoeia that actually refers to the sound made by the chef when he creates the noodles by pulling the dough and slapping it on the table.",

That's more of a \"use it or lose it\" though. But it makes sense at least.\n\nI cannot for the life of me comprehend how any of these symbols work. Yet there are thousands of them (from what I understand, anyway). How do Asian cultures text? Do they have to scroll through thousands of text suggestions? How are their keyboards set up?\n\nI even tried learning Japanese on DuoLingo, and I didn't last long. I did it a few hours every day for a week and got many things wrong. I can't memorize the symbols to their meaning. I learned a bit of Japanese when I played Final Fantasy 11 online, but they used letters instead of the symbols. That much I picked up. Was able to communicate basic things like \"Hey, want to group up?\" type of stuff.\n\nDoes writing a line the wrong way transform \"Happy Birthday!\" into \"I'm washing my dog today\"? One of my best buds at work was a Chinese lady who was our DBA, and she'd be on her phone texting in chinese, and I wanted so bad to ask \"How are you even doing that? How do you know what to say?\" I realized that would come off as odd, so never asked. But it's still a curiosity. Especially since she showed me a picture of her sister in China with her kids, and the caption was *symbols* INTERNET *more symbols* - like... do you just make up a new character for \"internet\" or just resort to english? \n\nI'm not trying to sound ignorant, but I don't understand how most languages use letters, but this area of the world uses strange archaic symbols and people know exactly what they mean.\n\nIs anyone here that can explain how this works?\n\nEdit: for example, Japanese. The symbol for 1 is a dash. The symbol for 2 is two dashes, as is 3. but four? 四  ... what? Yet I type in google translate to Japanese \"I have 4 dogs\" and it comes out as \"私は4匹の犬を飼っています\" Mind blown.",
