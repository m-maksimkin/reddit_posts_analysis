Might I point you to one Dick Cheney and one George W Bush… \nThis collective belongs to them. Yes the vote to get Bin Laden was virtually unanimous, but the extension into occupation belongs to those two and the manipulated world they created. Especially given the later Iraq moves which highlighted the real goals and lies of that administration. Sadly Afghanistan became a secondary war and the people became political pawns. But the blame I believe lies squarely on the Bush White House and his business buddies. Every president since was given this pandora’s box of a situation. I feel bad for Biden having to decide whether to keep feeding the machine or solve COVID related and massive economic issues here at home.  And absolutely gut wrenched for the people of Afghanistan who’s only crime was being in America’s way… What a shameful day for us all as Americans, but let’s not forget, Cheney and Bush should get a fair share more shame than anyone else... Aside from the Taliban. They are the real bad guys.\n\nEdit: Really? We’re downvoting this? Ugh, conservatives…",

Sure, there are lots of Afganistan citizens who want a democracy, but if after 20 years a country can't and won't defend democracy, then maybe you were wasting your time trying to install it. Does anyone really think KKK, Proud Boys, or the GOP in political power wants you to be able to vote? The Jan 6 insurrection wasn't about a corrupt voting system, it was about ensuring authoritarian rule stayed in power, and you aren't going to convince them to accept Democrat rule any more than the Afganistan population to accept what the US and NATO were trying to install.\n\nAnyone who served in Afganistan knew the moment the US left, it was going to fall apart because the population as a whole just doesn't think like a country that is ready for a popular vote to a centralized government. It doesn't matter if it was Obama, Trump, Biden, or whoever is in US power when the troops are removed, we all knew that 20 years of work wasn't going to hold up and at some point, we had to accept that we were in Afganistan wasting time and money on a democracy missionary work to a people who won't fight for their own rights.  \n\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-quick-collapse-in-afghanistan-proves-biden-was-right-to-leave-11629124589",

It was America's naiveté that thought it could work, but when it mattered, Afghanistan does not have a sense of pride in their national identity. And it was naiveté that America thought they could \"build\" or inspire such. Just wasn't in the cards, because at the end of the day, Afghanistan is a decentralized country where provincial power and local authority rules over any sort of centralized government in Kabul, or the paper tiger army that's been given everything it needed to fight for their current way of life. And that's the rub. They don't want it. Their leaders don't want it. The ANA officer Corps and higher leadership dont want it. They chose corruption and a free lunch. They aren't inspired by what the west tried to setup for them (which is insanely corrupt of course and it just goes to show the make-up and character of the country in general). It is still so incredibly tribal and Americans are realizing, by the minute, that Afghani's (a very loose term btw) don't really see a problem with the Taliban returning - or else they would've fought to resist it. That's clear as day now (even though it was American naivete to think, again, it could inspire extremely conservative Islamic subcultures to unite and push for centralized politics where equality between men and women was an agenda item...). Ain't gonna happen. Afghanistan didn't want it and didn't fight to preserve it. There's a reason why democracy is uttered in the same breath as \"self-determination\", and it's because it must be determined by the people that they want to change paths. The last week has shown that Afghani's have determined that the Taliban are welcome and that they are fine with going back to the way things were. Well...it's a shame it took trillions of dollars and lives of the coalition to realize the naivete of the nation-building effort in Afghanistan. The US handed them the keys to a MRAP but they chose a donkey instead. \n\nGood luck Afghanistan. If you want to change (which they obviously don't), it'll have to occur from within. Good luck to all those young women who grew up in a place where education was encouraged for the last 15 years, because they are the ones who will be affected by this the most. Many of them don't remember or weren't alive when the Taliban were there. For them, their home and their way of life just came crashing down - but again, it's because their countrymen (emphasize the \"men\" there) welcomed it with open arms. Afghanistan isn't a nation united. It is still a quagmire of warring subcultures, religious fundamentalism, misogyny, and corruption - of which they've chosen to tolerate or even champion.\n\nNgl, but as a veteran who served in Kandahar over a decade ago, my message and feeling to all this is simply.... good riddance.\n\nAs for the people on the runways clinging to airplane landing gear for dear life... they are the minority here. Their end is nigh, because their country chose its path. And their demise is so saddening, and my heart goes out to them. Their lives and their future are shattered. But it is because their countrymen didn't fight to defend any of the values they've experienced over the last decade and a half. They didn't fight to preserve it. Their own let them down, and it is their own who will eat them. Such a sad day/week. The one thing I'm thinking about is that for the 20 years the US was there, they were able to push for women's education and were able to educate an entire generation of youth. There are girls in their late teens and early twenties (college age!) that don't know a world where the Taliban rule. The US provided a glimpse to those girls as to what could be possible if they came together to fight this off. But their own let them down. They (the men) chose the Taliban with open arms. My heart goes out to the women of Afghanistan. The shame and cowardice of the men and the ANA who rolled a red carpet out for the Taliban... they failed these girls and future generations of women who will only know cloth bags and never see a textbook. Afghanistan chose its path and it looks to be quite unanimous with how little resistance existed. It is very insensitive, especially to the original post where people are dying on the airport tarmac trying to escape, but Afghanistan gave it all away. They and the Taliban deserve each other.",

I’m not handling this well and am disappointed, not in the US’s decision to pull out, but in the response times. After the taliban took the first few major cities, it was well known the ANA, despite whatever efforts they were putting in, were losing, at a much quicker pace than expected. We needed evacuation planes ages ago, the US staying calm though the first few takeovers and undermining the talibans capabilities are why we are here. They somehow forget how ruthless the taliban were and that they really don’t give a shit. This was a clusterfuck, and while I know the decision to pull out was inevitable, I can’t help but think the Biden administration was just sleeping these past few weeks and in denial about how quickly things turned bad and didn’t act until they were basically forced to by social media.\n\nFrom what it looks like, it seems like only the citizens of foreign countries may be evacuated. There’s just not enough time to get to a majority of the civilians that risked their lives to help foreign nations and that breaks my heart. It’ll mostly be the Afghan people left behind, and I’m sick and tired of all the countries being responsible for this stupid war yet their just sitting on their asses like maybe we’ll send an evacuation flight for the Afghan people. From the Soviet invasion where my moms friends used to drown themselves to avoid being raped by the Russians, to the Americans who gave birth to the talibans roots, to the well known countries that fund these terrorists like Israel and Saudi. Fuck you all. Your responsible and owe it to the innocents there to get them out. I would say I hope many more countries open their doors to afghan refugees but I know that won’t happen and I know at the end of the day the foreign lives will be prioritized over the Afghan people, but you all played a part and I sincerely just want to say, fuck you.\n\nTo those making cruel comments about refugees and where we will house them. I’ve come to learn a lot. I came here with nothing but still managed to put myself through university and now work as a director for a global firm. I pay my fair share of taxes and have never relied on the system for financial assistance. In fact, I worked even harder because I was grateful for the opportunities here. This is the case for most refugees, they feel grateful to study and work somewhere where they don’t have to fear for their life. In fact, members of my community cannot begin to fathom how one ends up homeless here because they truly see this nation as their heaven and a land full of opportunities. I was a resident manager for three years in low income housing. Funnily enough, almost all of the applicants on some sort of social welfare (disability, homeless, etc) were never refugees but citizens born in Canada. The refugees were always hustling and working.

They couldn't stop, so they lowered the rear airstair and started pulling people on board, all while taking fire from NVA troops. The plane was so overweight it barely left the runway and people that were hanging on the wings and landing gears either fell or were crushed when the gears were retracted. Some apocalyptic shit.

What are they supposed to fight back with, rocks? Against a force that our fully trained military with its superior weapons and billions upon billions of dollars couldn’t root out after 20 years? They’re desperate enough to think they could stop this plane or to try and escape. Either way it’s tragic and have some sympathy ffs. Most people would probably be running for their lives too.",
