You have extremely good bois, I've never had nearly as much success running this process on an animal being live recorded. Congrats on whatever training techniques you've implemented, and giving these amazing animals a home where they feel safe enough to allow you to train them like this.\n\nThe data present in this model represents stationary information across the majority of your video recording. Some thin areas may just not show up due to the low resolution of the MP4 video I scraped from the GIFv.  Due to the limited viewing angles recorded, the rear facing sides of objects aren't correctly represented, but are automatically filled in to maintain reasonable shapes rather than hollow forms. Translation: if its not in this model, it moved during the recording, the back sides of everything are janky.\n\n_________________\n\n**A 3d Model view:** https://autode.sk/3urAk1B (any device)\n\nScreenshots of the 3d scan: \n\n* [Best case scenario viewing angle](https://i.imgur.com/NkroQZz.jpg)\n* [From the left](https://i.imgur.com/bBI2A7y.jpg)\n* [From the right](https://i.imgur.com/HWPC22e.jpg)\n* [Mesh wireframe view](https://i.imgur.com/3eiK1Fj.jpg)\n* [3D scan model 'confidence'](https://i.imgur.com/nbMUbIl.jpg)\n* [Point cloud view including camera location thumbnails 1](https://i.imgur.com/hPCoFFC.png)\n* [Point cloud view including camera location thumbnails 2](https://i.imgur.com/13h5pcY.png)\n\n________\n\nI hope you enjoy :) No animals were harmed in the making of this model, although a few GPUs cried some.",
