Metro stops themselves are underground mini cities, with hundreds of restaurants and shops between each station. Shinjuku station alone has over 3.4 million passengers pass-through it a day and there are over 200 exit points just from that station alone. \n\nThe only thing about Tokyo trains are they get unbelievably busy during rush hours.

I think this in part explains the decline of mental health in big cities. Japan has a hermit youth problem now, and has had a suicide issue in the past.
