            "text": "People actually shake this guys hand\n\nEdit: I decided to take u/cedarnotes advice and put some information about donating to Ukraine's armed forces here. \nThe National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) opened a special account to accept donations for Ukraine's defense online by credit card, wire transfer, crypto, and Patreon.\n\nPatreon closed the NBU's Patreon account because, understandably, Patreon doesn't allow for fundraising for military activities. Wire transfer and crypto options aren't accessible or convenient for many people. Over the weekend, the NBU updated their webpage with the new option of donating by credit card. Please note that online payment systems (PayPal, Venmo, etc.) don't work. You'll need a Mastercard, Visa, etc.\n\nSee link below for NBU's webpage announcing the news, with both wire transfer instructions and credit card payment screen:\n\nhttps://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi\n\nPlease donate and share.\n\nThere's less media coverage about this than I expected, so I double checked that this is legitimate. The NBU webpage fundraising for Ukraine's defense is, in addition to being on the NBU's official website, also (1) mentioned by the official Twitter account of Ukraine, (2) mentioned by several news sources, including Bloomberg, Business Insider, and LA Times, and (3) listed in the top pinned post in r/Ukraine. (I wouldn't spread information on sending money to foreign bank accounts without some due diligence first.) See links below:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/1497294840110977024?t=dRvd2DdiW9hwppRZMma3fA&s=19\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-24/ukraine-is-using-crowdfunding-to-raise-money-for-its-military-in-war-with-russia\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-is-crowdfunding-to-shore-up-defense-against-russian-military-2022-2\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-03-08/la-ent-ukraine-digital-resistance\n\nhttps://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/ukrainians-living-in-san-diego-react/509-6ed713e5-815a-4b74-b46d-7bfb07b58b30\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/93bgba/stalker-2-developer-asks-fans-to-donate-to-ukraine-military\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/s6g5un/want_to_support_ukraine_heres_a_list_of_charities/\n\nAs with sending any money online, you should independently verify the information and the links. If you go to the National Bank of Ukraine's official website, you'll find the donation announcement and donation page under their news announcements.\n\nYou should always ALSO donate to conventional NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders, Red Cross, International Rescue Committee, UNICEF, UNHCR, etc. to support much-needed humanitarian efforts. I would actually urge you to donate to humanitarian efforts first. At the same time, repelling Putin's invasion will most directly end the deaths and suffering in Ukraine, and only then, can the rebuilding begin.\n\nThe OP from the original post scheduled a $500 wire transfer and made a $20 credit card \"test\" payment, and both seems to have worked: https://imgur.com/a/Aj42dRT.\n\nThere's a nominal processing fee involved for credit card payments, while banks normally charge $15 to $25 for wire transfers. If you're wiring the money, you should donate a higher amount so it's \"worth\" the wire transfer fee you might incur. International wire transfers involving intermediary / correspondent banks are also inconvenient and complicated if you haven't done them before. I'd recommend the credit card method.",
