People give Bush a lot of crap for his presidency  but he handled 9 / 11 pretty well and the days to follow as not many president have been privy to an attack on the united states. He was constantly engaged with the public and his improved speeches were alot better than his scripted ones. He then offered a pound of flesh for the American public by providing a target similar to the responce during the pearl harbor attacks.  Could you say the extended war was a mistake yes but in all honesty he was given bad Intel and rolled with it. The best time to leave next was the Obama adminstration after bin laden was killed after that it turned into nation building which doesn't really work that well but hey the mission objective changed when we didn't find weapons of mass destruction the words that were a stain on the bush administration. The reason we went in gun blazing is not because of Bush but the American public and the pressure for a swift responce.  We stayed longer mainly due during are initial interaction with the taliban when we supported them to fight off the soviets and did not support reconstruction efforts which I understand the reason of why not to leave as it would have been a problem down the line to prevent a reoccurring issue which is why the Obama administration said we would pull out but offered up more troops instead. We will skip the Trump admistration but for the most part the plan changed again and turned into making peace with Isreal and the neighboring countries in order to reduce strain on the region Parly because of the massive amount of hate for America revolves unrivaled support for the isreals government when almost everyone hates them in the region. Not a bad plan but  in all honesty it wasn't his plan either It was more of set up for him by the Obama administration. So in all honesty I don't think he brought much to the table for that one except being the public face for it. Now we are finally at biden who left after realize nation building during his time with Obama wasn't going anywhere. Not pushing blame on Obama or any of the others I think the lack of a plan comes back to the American public and then as soon as we got our pound of flesh we didn't care what happened next.

The Defense Department is one of the world‚Äôs top greenhouse gas emitters. The wars have been accompanied by erosions in civil liberties and human rights at home and abroad.\n\nThe human and economic costs of these wars will continue for decades with some costs, such as the financial costs of US veterans‚Äô care, not peaking until mid-century.\n\nMost US government funding of reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan has gone towards arming security forces in both countries. Much of the money allocated to humanitarian relief and rebuilding civil society has been lost to fraud, waste, and abuse.\n\nThe cost of the post-9/11 wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, and elsewhere totals about $8 trillion. This does not include future interest costs on borrowing for the wars.\n\nThe ripple effects on the US economy have also been significant, including job loss and interest rate increases.\n\nCompelling alternatives to war were scarcely considered in the aftermath of 9/11 or in the discussion about war against Iraq. Some of those alternatives are still available to the US.\n\nhttps://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/\n\nAll Papers\n\nhttps://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers",

There‚Äôs so much evidence, but the clearest is the huge amount put options placed in the stock market on the airlines previous to that day. A vast majority of those options moved through A. B. Brown, A firm formally headed by number three in the CIA. George Bush Senior was the head of the CIA, and just before 911 had a major meeting with a very important company that you probably have never heard of. The company is called the Carlyle group. The meeting had some of the main shareholders of the company present, the Bush family, the bin Laden family were included. The Carlyle group helped to broker a lot of the contracts that were received by Halliburton because the war began. It‚Äôs called pay for play. You have a vice president and president that have the power to execute various responses in war, and coincidentally, every reaction from the White House profited Cheney‚Äôs Halliburton and the Bush families Carlyle group, along with the bin Laden‚Äòs. Are you people crazy?\n\nPeople need to really stop reading any official news. The 9/11 commission is as much of a falsification as was the Warren commission in JFK‚Äôs time.

I phoned a friend who was on maternity leave and asked her if she could watch the news and find out what happened for me so she turned on the news. Not even ten mins later I answer her call and she screamed into the phone hysterically ‚Äúa plane just hit the other tower! America is being attacked‚Äù and my heart sunk. All of us were just stunned and didn‚Äôt know what was happening. Trying to call family members and find out if they were okay. It was scary. Every minute seemed like hours. On my coffee break we headed to a restaurant that had televisions on the wall to watch the news. The first tower had just fallen and it was so eery as hundreds of us packed into that small restaurant to watch in silence. I cried so much just thinking about the first responders and people who didn‚Äôt make it out. This changed me so much. I learned that day what anxiety and PTSD was. I‚Äôve lived with anxiety for twenty years now. It‚Äôs been hard to understand how it could have happened and I witnessed history unfold. Whenever I watch a movie or show with the Twin Towers in the background, my stomach aches and I feel that pain again. That night the news was just a repeat over and over of the footage of people jumping, of the tower being hit, of the buildings collapsing and it was like a horror film on repeat. My 11 year old asked me some questions last night and I tried to explain to him that some bad people wanted to hurt America and they ended up hurting the whole world.",

My teacher had gotten a call in his classroom and then wheeled over the TV to the center of the room and turned it on.  He flipped it over to the news and we could see that one of the towers was smoking.  We had no clue what was going on but we all remained glued to the screen.  And then it happened.  United Airlines flight 175 crashed into the south tower.  I remember one of the students screaming and getting up to leave.  The teacher asked him where he was going, and with tears in his eyes he said, ‚ÄúMy mom works in that tower.‚Äù And then he left.  I never saw him again after that so I have no idea what happened, but his name was Eric and I think I will always remember that too.  Going to my next class, that‚Äôs what we did in there as well.  We watched.  My teacher rambled about what he thought was going on.  He believed it was investors who had lost a lot of money and flew their planes into the buildings.  Until the news broke that a plane also flew into the Pentagon.  I think he was just in denial before that.  We were released early that day.  The town I‚Äôm from has three military bases and the closest one to me is a primary training base for Air Force pilots.  It was an eerie walk home. The roads were quiet; the skies were abnormally quiet.  I think people were afraid that the base could be a target of attack.  When I got home, my parents were watching the news as well.  I remember watches President Bush deliver his speech to the nation.  I don‚Äôt care how you feel about the man, but that speech is one of the most chilling and empowering speeches ever delivered by any American president.  Then I went to bed and woke up to a new America.  The American spirit didn‚Äôt die that day, but our innocence did.  Or maybe it was mine.  I don‚Äôt know.  But I do know that I will never forget that day.  Things were never the same again and everything before that seems so hazy and just out of reach.

Two people disagreed, said ‚Äúno, its just behind the other tower‚Äù. \n\nWhen the second tower collapsed, I remember the look of horror on the faces around me. One of them, from New York, walked away, unable to watch anymore.\n\nThe anthrax letters came like a couple of days later. This made me wonder ‚Äúwhat is next?‚Äù. It was all so unpredictable and confusing.\n\nI remember making contingency plans with family on the 11th and 12th to evacuate the United States. We felt like there would soon be military checkpoints at major intersections, and we wanted to get ahead of that, before road travel became restricted.\n\nA friend who was planning to visit from Canada in a few weeks called to cancel on the 12th or 13th, saying they didn‚Äôt want to come if there was going to be a war inside the United States.\n\nThis may sound insane, but keep in mind we didn‚Äôt know for the first few days who was doing this, why, or what they may do next.",

I remember waking up and 7 am and going upstairs to get ready for school. If I'm correct the tv was already on and I couldn't understand what was happening. My mom was yelling is what I remember. I remember seeing the building on TV. I remember I had gym that day and my mom said we couldn't go to school and I was saying \"no I want to go no no\". We kept begging to go to school that day. \n\nThen the 2nd plan hits and we see it live on TV. I'm kind of just staring in shock. Too young to understand. Hearing my mom yell and calling my grandma. The next moments are a blurr. Then I suddenly remember my mom being very frantic walking us to school. Me and my brother. I think my sister wasn't in school yet or in kindergarten. I didn't realize I got to school late until I walked into my class. I realize I get to school around 9:30am. \n\nI was so confused because everyone was quiet and working like normal. I told the table I was at because it would be 4 desk together like a square. I said \"did you hear about the planes? You guys didn't hear about the explosion in the building? Somewhere along the lines of that. \n\nThe other kids all said no. I was so shocked that they didn't know what happened because they went to school on time. That's all I remember about that day. When the pentagon got attacked my mom ran back to the school cause we only gives a few blocks down. To see if our school was still standing because she thought the school got hit with a bomb. Very scary times. I remember a year later so 3rd grade taking a moment of silence in P.E class, the class I didn't want to miss the a year prior when it happened :(. I had so much anxiety and it felt like it just happened. For the rest of elementary school we had a moment of silence for September 11th. For me that wad until 2008. \n\nEvery year we talk about that day. My mom remembers the whole day so she always tell us how the rest of the day went. I can't remember at the moment so I'll come back to edit this comment after I talk with my mom.",

The cowardly terrorist attack on our soil changed our way of life in many ways and exposed us to the reality that we were no longer safe at home from a new age of terrorism. While we commonly say 'Never Forget', I think it is important to not just treat that as a comfort phrase. It's important to remember the real meaning of the phrase and how the events of 9/11 united our country in a common purpose and sense of interdependence. The meaning of 'Never Forget' seems to have been lost over the last two decades. Today, we fight over things as silly as masks and as serious as the cause of the Capitol Insurrection. We no longer seem to have a collective common purpose. We no longer have that sense of national interdependence. 'Never Forget' needs to be more than a passive expression to pay homage to a tragedy. It needs to be a meaningful statement that leads to reflection of ourselves as a nation and how we all are in **this** together. Weak people have made hard times in this country. We need to return to the day that strong people make good times.",

I was across town. \n\nSitting in English class with the sweetest and most soft spoken teacher I ever had. The math teacher popped in and whispered something to her and she paled. She turned on the TV and we all watched the reporting not really understanding. Shortly after switching to my next class, we saw the 2nd tower get hit. I‚Äôve never seen a teacher cry before, so when the big, tough math teacher started tearing up..we all knew it was the start of something awful. So many of us went home early that day because that was a real fear that, since the POTUS was visiting a school in Sarasota, something may happen at one of them. \n\nThat was actually the first day I ever wrote in a journal.",

All of us installers were in the office getting ready to go and we were glued to the television after the first plane hit.  It was a perfectly clear sky in NYC that day.... we were so perplexed on how a plane accidentally hit the WTC.  The last thing anyone imagined was that it was on purpose.  Then the second plane hit.... I recall a split second of \"wait, was the a replay of the first hit?\" and then realizing it was a second plane and the immediate realization of this being intentional.  We were stunned.... and of course now we didn't know how widescale this would become.  Did they plan on hitting 1000 targets, 1 target, or something in between?  \nThe bosses eventually ushered us out of the office and on to our installs. I called my wife and she went to get our children from school.   I made it to my first appointment and I just joined that customer watching tv coverage of the attack until the second tower fell.  Cancelled all my appointments for the day and went home where we just stayed glued to the news for days.  \nI think the world suddenly lost an amount of innocence that day when it became clear that this was the new threat.... that people would sacrifice themselves along with an entire plane full of people to cause terrorism .While this might seem normal to people today, it was not 20 years ago.... nobody saw something this extreme as a possibility.   \nI planned to drive to NYC and help.  But the news kept telling us that they had too many people already and not to come.  I recall a local fire department here had guys collecting donations right in the middle of our busiest intersection.  I literally emptied my pockets into their boots every time I passed.  \nThere was a unity among Americans that I've never witnessed at any other time in my life.  Even the petty bickering of politics ended in DC for a good while.  \nI also think we were so blind with rage that we wanted someone to pay and we didn't care who.  Taking down Iraq was good enough for us... they were the scapegoat we needed.  They weren't the masterminds behind this but at the time I don't think anyone cared since Saddam Hussein was known to fund terrorism and that was close enough.  \nGeorge W Bush and Rudy Giulianni were America's darlings at that time.  They were everything you wanted in such leaders.  We were in pain and they acted and spoke in the ways that we needed.  \nThe feelings of that day are still with me.  Even 20 years later it feels like it was only a couple years ago.",

He could have been the face of the nation in that time but he didn't have that charisma or whatever it is called to be the go to guy for our healing and recovery. I moved to another major city about 8 months before 9/11 so I was saved from actually being in Manhattan during the attack. Unfortunately I had family and friends still there at the time. It really affected me even to this day. My Dad helped out as a project manager at the site of the towers starting less than 12 hours after the towers collapsed. He wrote all of his kids a letter about what he saw and experience. I haven't read it. It is too much pain and feeling helpless at the time. Would be brought up I think. I haven't been to the site since before it happened. I don't know if I will ever visit it. Too many memories for me I guess. So sad all around.\n\nTo me the person the face of 9/11 was Rudy Giuliani who brought me through and I think a lot of the nation. He was the US's \"mayor\" our beacon of hope. It is been really sad to see him fall so so much in these last 5 or so years. I'm Social Democrat and even I toyed with the idea of voting for him when he ran in the primary for president in 2008. That would have been a major 1st for me. He did a beautiful job at reviving New York City from what it became in the 70's and 80's to the shining city looking so squeaky clean that Time Square is now thought of as Disney, CNN and MTV instead of seedy sex shops and live all nude girl shows. He and his team did incredible things to make NYC the \"greatest city in the world\". He has fallen so hard. I really wonder how it happened to him. He was once \"Mayor Rudy\" the face of a nation, our beacon of hope. He is now a comic book villain, a joke with hair dye and spray tanner running down his face on TV. To a meme that makes him into a running joke as a crazy old boomer ranting complete bullshit with statements easily proven false and insane in a lot of people opinions.

I was in history class when all of a sudden a teacher opened the door to our classroom and told my teacher to turn on the TV. He did, and we all watched in shock. After watching the second plane hit he turned to our class and said somberly, ‚ÄúThis is history in the making. The world will never be the same after this.‚Äù We continued to watch for a bit longer until they started showing people hanging out of windows and on the roofs of the towers, then he turned off the TV and we all just sat in silence. Counselors started coming back into the classroom about every 10-20 minutes, pulling my classmates out to take them to the office. This continued happening for the remainder of the school day, in every class. The entire school was in shock. The kids being pulled out were being told that their parents or siblings hadn‚Äôt been in contact, couldn‚Äôt be reached. I got home that afternoon and remember my parents talking to our neighbors in the streets. Our neighbor‚Äôs husband hadn‚Äôt returned home yet. The bridges and tunnels and trains out of the city were all shut down. Finally around 12-1 AM he made it home. He had to walk from the financial district, across all of Manhattan, through the Bronx, New Rochelle and all the way to Stamford before he could get back in his car he left at the train station that morning. My best friend had saved her dad that day because she was running late and he always drove her to school. He missed his usual train and had to take the next one, making him ~30 minutes later than usual. He got all the way to Manhattan before all of the lines were shut down. The rest of the week in school multiple kids weren‚Äôt back in class. They were the ones who had lost parents and siblings in the towers.\n\nThat was, and still is, the longest, toughest day of my life.",

On the walk back, the skies were filled with military helicopters on the move from the nearby military base. Nobody talked. All classes were immediately canceled and buildings were locked up.

Felt like we were watching the world end in front of our eyes.\n\n20 years later it's hard to believe what came from that day. The political, social, financial impact from that day. What I never forget is between the time when the tragedy occured and before the insanity of how we retaliated and how some people (mostly military contractors) profited off of the tragedy, for those first few weeks.

            "text": "I recall being a senior in high school. Lived about 45 mins south of NYC. We had computers in our classroom, and our teacher liked to have one of us login to bring up the opening stock market stuff on screen. Was a small class (special Ed math) When I logged in, CNN, AOL, and MSN didn't load like normal, so I went to Yahoo. That's when we saw images of the first tower hit with speculation that a small plane struck the tower. Her husband worked in NYC so she went and turned on the TV, and we saw the live footage happening. While watching the news, another teacher came running in to ask her (our teacher) if she had talked to her husband yet. With the door open, we saw the second plane hit. The screams echoing down the hallways through our door, along with our local class gasping still gives me heart dropping palpations again while typing this.\n\nWe had many classmates who's parents worked in NYC and several in the twin towers. We went into almost an active shooter type lockdown, parents started showing up getting kids out, class was cancelled the next day. I remember vividly walking outside my parents house the rest of the week and smelling very clearly the smell of sheetrock and dust in the air. Grief counseling was brought into our school. The candlelight vigils that happened outside so many of my classmates homes, that turned into empty casket funerals was even worse. \n\nTwo of My neighbors dad's worked for the city municipal cleanup crews, and took photos (that they weren't supposed too) mainly because the grim cleanup of remains was too much to believe without photo evidence. Buckets of \"like objects\" for example was straight out of a Halloween slasher films. Arms, legs, hands, etc in buckets/piles. That really messed me up for a while.\n\nThe memorial unveilng at our school was updated as more names came about after confirmation of death. That was basically the culmination of my senior year. My teachers husband was ok, he happened to be one of those people who missed the train in the morning and was running late. He turned around when he saw and heard what was happening.\n\nAdditionally, our Junior Prom the year prior was on \"The Spirit of NY\" which was a boat cruise that went around new York harbor. We all have couple photos in front of the twin towers at sunset. Who thought anyone would want to remeber junior Prom.. let alone... That way.",

One of them was in my class, kind of confused, and they got up to go.\n\nA minute or two later, our teacher got pulled aside, then she left and wheeled in a TV.  The lesson for the day was canceled, this was too important.\n\nShe explained briefly what was going on, and said that anyone who wished not to see what was happening had her permission to go up to the library until the next bell.  I don't think anyone left, and she turned on the TV, and none of us said a word as we watched the towers fall.  I remember a girl in the class, Nirosha‚Äîwe just sort of stared at each other, everything was too fucked up to take in.\n\nThe bell was cut and students were told to stay in whatever classrooms they were in, and school was cancelled shortly after that.

You could clearly perceive the horror in his voice when he asked that question.\n\nA few more seconds passed by in silence (while, I assume, the studio confirmed that it wasn't a replay) then we finally heard the reporter again, almost screaming at the microphone:\n\n- OMG OMG A SECOND PLANE JUST HIT THE TOWER!

It was found out that one of the terrorists had made their way down to VA Beach in a cab with plans to do something there. The news coverage was on every channel about the towers. Then finally in the evening the tower collapsed live on the news, to hear the people below on ground watching the tower fall, to hear the cries, people screaming ‚ÄúOh my God, oh my God it‚Äôs falling‚Äù,  hearing screams of ‚ÄúGOD NOOOOO!!‚Äù It was a horrible day for America.

There were murmurs in the break room as it's happening of \"We need to go nuke those fuckers!\" and at that time **we didn't know who \"those fuckers\" even were**. That struck me odd. Drag out nuclear weapons and we don't even know who or why? I truly suspected it was a group of Ex Wall Streeters who'd lost big and went apeshit. Lost it all and decided to strike back at the financial machine that they viewed as being the cause of their failures. At that point, if you'd said \"Taliban\" most would've thought you were talking about someone making a rule about not using the tally marks to keep count of things or something.\n\nI was just about to turn 16.

The pages had the dates and time of when he printed them and apparently his computer had the dates wrong and it showed something like June 2000 or something and I immediately didn‚Äôt believe it because I would have heard about it if that had happened over a year ago! Remember kids, we couldn‚Äôt just take out our iPhone to get the news these days so it wasn‚Äôt until later that night I learned it was actually true and I knew then and there that this would be something that would change the world moving forward, especially for the US and their allies. It didn‚Äôt take many years before many of my friends had their first deployment to assist USA in the Middle East and one of my friends just came back from his last deployment a few months ago.
