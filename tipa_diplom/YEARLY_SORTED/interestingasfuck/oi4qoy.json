My car went down a hill and crashed. I took the “backroads” in Texas and nobody saw it. Thankfully no other cars were hit. I had no feeling of the crash and I didn’t feel the car go down the hill. I woke up with shattered windshield glass in my lap & both airbags deployed.  I was able to walk away from the crash on my own and walked up the hill sitting on the curb. I thought I was dreaming and I called 911. The police and ambulance came within 3-5 minutes and took me to the hosptial. The hospital staff performed X-rays and an MRI scan. The scans revealed 3 cracked ribs, a fractured spine and a brain tumor. I didn’t need surgery for the ribs or spine but the tumor had to be removed. The surgery was 5 hours with one week of physical therapy & 3 months of paid time off to recover. The total cost was $140k with my health insurance covering it. Fast forward after the surgery and I had 3 more followup MRIs done with no tumor regrowth found. I have lived longer than the 2 year diagnosis originally given. I am thankful for a successful recovery, thankful to the police, ambulance crew, hospital staff and doctors. I am thankful to my family and friends. It has put life in a different perspective on many levels. \n\nBe safe & take care.\n\nMark",

Dr office called me while I was on break & in the break room (want to shut up a room full of bus drivers really fast) the nurse tells me that they found a tumor in my nasal passage about the size of a of my thumb nail) and the 2 tears in my rotator cuff (& that was why I couldn't use my arm) so she gave me the names of 2 Surgeon,  a ENT & Orthopedic. I got in to see both. The Orthopedic Surgeon wouldn't touch me until I had the tumor dealt with.  So spring break (I normally would work as sub when we had breaks like this, but told my dispatcher that I was having surgery & wouldn't be available the week of my break, was having problems with my supervisor & didn't bother telling her) so have the surgery on Monday and was sounding like Minnie Mouse (I did for almost 2 weeks) on Thursday the lab called me.
