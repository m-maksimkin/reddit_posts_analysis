Eugene Williams, a Black teenager, walked to South Side Beach. Eugene, who was 17 at the time, put his make-shift raft into Lake Michigan and began floating in the cool waters. \nAs he waded, Eugene’s raft mistakenly crossed an invisible color line drawn in the waters of Lake Michigan. Suddenly, a white man trying to protect that invisible color line, began to throw stones at the Black teenager.\nThe barrage of stones hit Eugene, knocking him off his raft. Eugene fell, sinking into the cold waters. The Black teenager drowned.\nHis murder would spark one of the worst episodes of racial violence in the city’s history, setting off seven days of clashes. White people climbed into cars and raced through the Black Belt of the city, shooting at Black people, burning and looting Black people’s homes.\n\n“After seven days of shootings, arson and beatings, the Race Riot resulted in the deaths of 15 whites and 23 blacks with an additional 537 injured (195 white, 342 black),” according to the Chicago History Museum. “Since then, a century of African American activism has challenged the racism and social hypocrisy that allowed those responsible for Eugene Williams’s death to elude justice.”\nThe NAACP investigator Walter White concluded: “The Chicago riot taught me that there could be as much peril in a Northern city when the mob is loose as in a Southern town such as Estill Springs. I was constantly made aware in white areas, especially the Halsted Street area near the stockyards, that eternal alertness was the price of an uncracked skull. I naively believed that I was well enough known in Negro Chicago, despite my white skin, to wander about at will without danger. This fallacy nearly cost me my life.”",

That’s a great drive time for us to go to the beach, since a trip to the ocean would take a minimum of 12 hours.\n\nAnyways, I’ve taken this exact photo every year. Amazing to see it on the front page of Reddit. However, the picture makes it seem like the skyline is directly across the lake which is untrue. (Not the fault of OP - Just the way it appears). \n\nWhen actually looking straight out over the lake, this view actually follows the coastline to the left. Another cool (albeit unsettling) view which is a little closer than Chicago, is the giant steel mill pouring smoke into the atmosphere in Gary, Indiana.",

It's possible the outline of the buildings, that are blocking the Sun's light that is travelling directly into the eyes of the viewer, are subsequently 'magnified'. (By the same illusion from the refraction of light that it appears to be surrounded by, that had caused the initial illusion of the Sun being large and red. \nAnother thing is sea level. I don't know if it applies to this picture of not, but you can see further if your on higher elevation than what is on the horizon or if what is on the horizon has a significant elevation in general, like if I put an object on the top/back of a large ball. I won't be able to see it unless it's big enough to been seen over the top of it.

If you were there and looked to your left about 45-80 degrees, you’d see the Steel Mills. That area is Gary Indiana. There’s a minor league baseball team there called the Gary SouthShore Railcats and sometimes, my mom would drive me up there and see a game. The actual field is about 1/4 the size of a major league field, but I always enjoyed those games more than a major league game live. Felt more intimate and real.",
