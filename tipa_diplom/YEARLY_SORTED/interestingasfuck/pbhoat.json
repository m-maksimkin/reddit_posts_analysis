With our new heat shielding technology, I‚Äôd love to see either some sort of heavy-duty rover or, if that‚Äôs too impractical, a stationary lander, with a high quality video lens and sensors to get as much data as possible.\n\nThere‚Äôs only so many Mars photos you can take before you realize that most people only see it as just a red rocky terrain due to over-exposure. I think, that even IF it was impractical, the photos of a 4th targeted celestial visitation mission would be a really cool idea.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk though. Sorry for the rant!",
