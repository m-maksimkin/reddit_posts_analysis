The pup has just learned (rightly so) that actions have consequences when interacting with the world around you - sometimes good ones, sometimes bad ones.",

I‚Äôve never had to hit any of my dogs in my life, and have no problems communicating with them when they‚Äôre doing wrong or good. They don‚Äôt want to do wrong. They want to be accepted in a social group, they need it. Even when you see a violent dog, it‚Äôs because they think they‚Äôre doing right. And you can let them know they‚Äôre incorrect, without ever getting violent back. \n\nIt blows my mind how many breeders, to this day, honestly believe the ‚Äúalpha male wolf‚Äù nonsense and defend it to their grave that it‚Äôs some kind of natural truth and not man-made horseshit. Even the guy who lived with wolves and wrote the book where it was referenced first has been spending the last like 40 years desperately trying to correct peoples nonsensical oversimplified interpretation of his observations. Wolves and dogs aren‚Äôt organized with an alpha male leader. It‚Äôs always just more of a family setting, even when wolves from other families pack together, and leadership is exchanged temporarily with the situation, male or female. It ESPECIALLY isn‚Äôt based on violent strength. If a young mother manages to bring home the bacon and keep others warm, she‚Äôs followed. When she‚Äôs off somewhere, another one that has good instincts is followed. \n\nYou can literally debate with a dog with body language and learned sounds/words/behaviors. You have to learn how they communicate just as they have to learn how you communicate. If you have to get a dog to do what you want with brute force, even if they‚Äôre eventually conditioned to accept that as their life‚Äôs reality and find happiness with it, it‚Äôs cruel and you don‚Äôt understand dogs very well. Just because manipulating from a young age gets the job done, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs natural or the right thing to do.\n\nExample- it‚Äôs always SO much harder to train a dog to do advanced things, like open round door handles, with brute force and repetition, than it is with communication and trust building. Because the latter is simply the natural way they do things and what they‚Äôre wired to be comfortable with and understand- not brute force. They have to be conditioned and manipulated and raised to understand and learn things through force- It‚Äôs not how they are out the womb.",

Every time the puppy did this the old dog snapped and barked at it. When she eventually caught the puppy she pinned it. Within a day, the puppy was no longer making the lunging attacks and would gently approach the old dog to engage in play. They played together so sweetly it was super heartwarming. Most dogs seem to instinctively know how to be gentle and tolerant with puppies but also firm about their foolishness. Some dogs really don't like puppies of course so it is important not to force it and monitor carefully. It is really hard as a human to replace the dog-to-dog interaction and reinforcement. I believe it is quite important to socialize puppies both with other puppies and with older dogs.",
