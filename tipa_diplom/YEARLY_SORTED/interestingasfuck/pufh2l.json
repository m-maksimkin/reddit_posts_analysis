Absolutely. Would the batteries be heavier? No doubt.

Really just depends on what you're trying to do.\n\nThe pace of EV development is moving fairly quickly and there are several promising battery technologies on the horizong that might be somewhat game changing for EVs either by making  batteries cheaper to produce, more easily replaced/recycled, more stable and long lasting and potentially greater capacity (although this last one is perhaps the most difficult). The next 10 years or so will be very interesting for this space as just about every major manufacturer of cars and bikes (and scooters and everything in between) will have EV options on the market by then.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if we start to see hybrid swap/integrated solutions either.

With the drop in oil prices, plus electronic components are easier to have problems which means more maintenance fees, and so on.  \nOther than that, I think the experiences of riding a Gogoro are very satisfying. Since it is super quiet while waiting for the red light, the acceleration is very smooth and fast, and most importantly, riding a Gogoro on the rode always catches people's eye(not anymore since it has become more and more prevalent)  \np.s. Ironically, Taiwan uses thermal power plants to generate 70-80% electricity for our country. So is Gogoro real \"clean\" to earth? In my opinion, there are still lots of space to improve.  \n\n\npicture of my sister knocked off my Gogoro due to improper way of parking.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/j3DLOaM",

I’ve ridden it over 20K km, mainly as a commuter, and with my recently upgraded belt, it should go for at least another 20K.  I love riding my Gogoro and here are the pros and cons, from my own experience:\n\nPros:\n\n- smooth riding experience, no vibrations\n- ⁠sufficient acceleration to get you out in front of traffic and stay there\n- ⁠lack of sound and smell at stop lights\n- Bluetooth / App key\n- ⁠battery swapping is very fast\n- battery swap stations are everywhere (over 2100 in Taiwan now)\n- can use Apple Pay to pay the bill directly from the app\n- customizable preferences from the App\n\nCons:\n- the advertised range and reality is pretty different. I’m about 80kgs and I ride on the faster end of the spectrum, so I average around 40kms on a swap. I did recently get over 60kms with the newer generation of battery which was nice. It would be best if we could get 80-100 kms but the battery swap is so easy, that it’s almost a non-issue for a commuter\n- at peak times (basically around 6-8pm on weeknights), you can’t get a full battery so you have to be strategic about when to swap. Gogoro has attempted to solve this with the app by showing which stations are fully charged, but I’m stuck on going to the same stations rather than a different or unfamiliar one\n- on the S1, the Bluetooth key capability can be slow to respond at times \n- the S1 has a relatively small compartment underneath the seat, though that was solved in later models \n- the S1 seat, without the additional rear bumper bar, isn’t suitable for taking a passenger. This was also improved in later models\n- the cheapest monthly billing model still has a minimum 299 NT (~$10) fee which prevents Sunday riders from buying in",
