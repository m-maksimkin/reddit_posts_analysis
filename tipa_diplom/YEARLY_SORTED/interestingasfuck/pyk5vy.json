There was no interruption to gas, heat, electricity, water, sewage, or the telephone service they provided. No one inside felt it move.\n": [

There is a commemorative statue of the engineer that made this project a success.\nHere is a quote from a website I found…\n\n “IN 1927, PLANS WERE MADE to expand Juárez Avenue. The Mexican Telephone Company building, which stood in the middle of the avenue, was protected from being demolished, however, so as not to interrupt the country’s telephone service. The building stood in place for more than 20 years, clogging the newly expanded avenue, until someone came up with the idea to move the building while the telephone operators worked inside.\n\nEngineer Jorge Matute Remus proposed the idea of sliding a platform under the building that allowed it to be moved along a set of tracks. The proposal was cheaper than the costly alternative of building the telephone company a whole new building, and also prevented the telephone service from being disrupted for more than six months.\n\nThe historic procedure took place from October 24 to 28, 1950. With the help of mechanical jacks, the 1,700-ton-building moved about 40 feet (12 meters) while the communication operators continued to work inside. It was considered an engineering feat, and that is why a commemorative statue of Remus was placed in front of the building”.",

Architect Kurt Vonnegut Sr. had other plans. He suggested the building could be moved to make room for expansion.\n\nJohn Eichlea Co of Pittsburgh was contractor for the move while Bevington, Taggert & Fowler were the engineers, Vonnegut, Bohn & Mueller were the project architects.\n\n\nBetween Oct. 12 and Nov. 14 1930 the eight-story 11,000-ton Indiana Bell building was shifted 52 feet south along Meridian St. and rotated 90 degrees to face New York St. Workmen used a concrete mat cushioned by Oregon fir timbers 75-ton, hydraulic jacks and rollers, as the mass moved off one roller workers placed another ahead of it. Every six strokes of the jacks would shift the building three-eights of an inch - moving it 15 inches per hour.\n\n\nGas, electric heat, water and sewage were were maintained to the building all during the move. The 600 workers entered and left the traveling structure using a sheltered passageway that moved with the building. The employees never felt the building move and telephone service went on without interruption. And yes, the move took less than 30 days. It remains one of the largest buildings ever moved. The building was demolished in 1963.",

There was no interruption to gas, heat, electricity, water, sewage, or the telephone service they provided. No one inside felt it move.   \nPeople could still enter/exit the building thanks to an entryway that moved moved it, which connected to a special curved sidewalk.

They planned to demolish it but that would've interrupted phone service for a big chunk of Indiana, which they didn’t want to do.  \n\\- They lifted the whole building with steam-powered hydraulic lifts, then set it on enormous pine logs. It was moved via hand-operated jacks, which pushed it over the logs 3/8\" at a time. Once the building rolled far enough forward, the last log would be moved to the front.  \n\\- The rotation plan was conceived & executed by famous architect Kurt Vonnegut Sr (father of the famous author)  \n\\- The feat remains one of the largest building-moves in history.  \n\\- The building was demolished in 1963.",

Meridian was sold and has since been converted to a mixed-use building with condos, apartments, pool, parking garage and really neat amenities. It's now called 220 Meridian. Here's their promo page https://www.220meridian.com/photogallery ATT had their call center in that building and they had several other office users over the years to split costs. As technology improved and labor forces consolidated, the new addition just wasn't needed and didn't make sense. So the buildings were severed in 2018-2019. This building pictured was designed to make it through the worst of circumstances, that if all else failed at least you'd have a means to contact someone. But now, that's relative given that building doesn't host our telecom towers but does have a lot of backup equipment as always. It's a true marvel that it's still here, lived through an addition and seperation. I don't believe that building was meant to outlive the addition's usefulness for what it was, but it did. They also bought very random, expensive fairly rare Azure glass that make replacements tricky and costly so honestly the new part wasn't ever going to be sustainable in a new tech, profit driven world.",
