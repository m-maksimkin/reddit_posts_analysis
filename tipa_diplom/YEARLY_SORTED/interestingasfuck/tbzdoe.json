This does a disservice to the reality that these troops face on the ground. Don't think they're always winning, this is a hard fight. Fear for the lives of Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n\nTactics time;\n\n\nI would say this is an uneven fight and the Russians will have certainly won this engagement if the Ukrainian ambush party didn't happen to escape in time. \n\nThe reason I say this is because while burning and exploding tanks are clearly seen, it's only two, and there are clearly more. The Russians in this case have more men and armour. Sure the Ukrainians gain the initiative via surprise, and eliminate a chunk of the heavy armour at the start. The Russians however, can easily gain that back by having the infantry take cover in decent firing positions, and having their armour consolidate and surround the Ukrainian position. Once the Ukrainians begin to peel back, the BMP's and infantry can pursue. The Russian response to the ambush more or less followed that pattern, as can be seen. \n\nHopefully we can get the full video for this, and find out what really happened.",

This is a very undisciplined/untrained unit. \n\nYou can’t see it in this video but there’s more footage that shows dismounted troops alongside the tanks as well. As soon as the first RPG hits, you see a couple vehicles and about a dozen troops IMMEDIATELY try and run away to the other side of the road. I couldn’t spot the machine gun fire, but it’s there, because the ambushers immediately gun down about a half dozen soldiers.\n\nThis column absolutely froze up. There was really no effort to return fire (you should always do this, immediately violently in order to stop the initial ambush and gain fire superiority), and that’s why those Russians aren’t going home. Towards the end, one tank does return fire, but it seems sort of panicked, through trees, and I think they immediately catch a rocket after shooting. \n\nIf two teams of 4 Ukrainians can absolutely dismantle an entire armored unit like this, it’s going to continue to be a long and costly war for Russia. \n\nIf anyone is interested, check out the Wikipedia about the first Battle of Grozny when the Russians fought the Chechens. It’s eerily similar and it seems like Russia hasn’t learned a thing.\n\nEdit - here is the unedited footage I saw first: https://www.instagram.com/tv/Ca-lXwvtABy/?utm_medium=share_sheet",

So you can assume:  30 seconds for them both to make the field?  It took 5 seconds just for the 2nd APC to cross the road (there's a joke there).   \n\n5) Then eventually, you see the stopped tank fire a round into the trees.   You can see the amount of smoke resulting from that blast -- so you know its the first round fired.  A 2nd tank has had time to pull up beside it.   \n\n6)  So what the heck were they doing?   They had to stop and load a shell?   And no machine gun fire from the tank?  I would expect that you'd see the muzzle flashes if it was firing.
