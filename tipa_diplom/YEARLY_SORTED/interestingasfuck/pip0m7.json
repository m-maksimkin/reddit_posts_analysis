If one had mental health issues, would the other have the same issues?, do intoxicants affect them both equally when ingested?\n\nThen there's the nitty gritty: do they both feel orgasm at the same time? If not, and one was gay, would they they both feel turned off by the other having sex? Would that affect lubrication? Do they feel awkward doing certain everyday tasks, like using the bathroom, because it's similar to having someone else in the bathroom? What would happen if one, or both, developed blushing bladder syndrome? Obviously the question of marriage, and how it would be the most comfortable for them (polygamy? Separate partners? If it's not a polygamous state, and they want to be, would it cause issues if one was the sister who was legally \"married\"?) How would they rationalize sexuality between them, as any sex would require your sister to be there?\n\nA lot of these might be offensive, but I'm asking in genuine curiosity, not any sort of intentional prejudice. I've genuinely never seen something like this before. It must be insanely genetically rare that conjoined twins would be this intertwined and still have a decent looking quality of life. Its incredibly cool to me.\n\nEdit: I also thought of some genetic questions, is there a possibility to pass it to children they have? Does it cause any other related genetic issues?\n\nI kinda like the thought of a complete separate person who you're literally attached to, who goes through all the exact same experiences in life as you. They'd be an incredible reservoir of advice.\n\nAlso: can they do two separate tasks at the same time as long as they require one hand? Could they play 2 different video games using 1-handed controllers?\n\nEdit 2: I would literally kill to see an AMA by these two",

Would you have to remove all the tissue/organs from the dead twin because the tissue would also be dead/not receiving blood? Would that tissue, say the spinal cord of the deceased twin, continue living if separation is possible, meaning does it receive enough circulation for necrosis not to be a worry? The end of life plan for either/both of them would be so complex.. I feel horrible even thinking about it but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm most interested in.

They are dicephalic parapagus twins, and are highly symmetric for conjoined twins, giving the appearance of having a single body without marked variation from typical proportions. Each has a separate heart, stomach, spine, pair of lungs, and spinal cord.\n\nEach twin controls one arm and one leg. As infants, learning to crawl, walk, and clap required cooperation. They can eat and write separately and simultaneously. Activities such as running, swimming, hair brushing and driving a car require coordinated action.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abby_and_Brittany_Hensel",
