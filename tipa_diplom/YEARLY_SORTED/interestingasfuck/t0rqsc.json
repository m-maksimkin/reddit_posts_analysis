If there would be a WW3 (a Western World war) many of the great powers and many nations would get involved and the destruction and disruption of the entire world would surely follow.\n\nI’m not saying that we shouldn’t help Ukraine. I’m just saying that unfortunately, we can’t risk more war. It is, cynically, better to isolate the warring and destruction to one place and not let it spread. \n\nEconomic sanctions is the best way so far. I hope more military intervention won’t be necessary. If it gets to the very edge and it is necessary, then so be it. With the faith of the modern world of humanity as we know it. \n\nWhere are the neutral league of assassins when the world needs them?",

This is going to progress into a world war and we're doing exactly what we did to England and Greece and other parts of Europe who were begging for our help all because Americans don't want to be apart of war right now and want to do everything possible to prevent our people from being involved over a threat. Putins crazy, but he's not crazy enough to END THE FUCKING WORLD IN A NUCLEAR DISASTER!

He's been hinting at it for 20ish years! I pray we don't abandon Ukraine. They've shown that they are a proud people who support America's way of life, so much that the president spoke out against our own orange tyrant, even in the face of financial consequence through massive sanctions.

Today Russia attacked the entire territory of our state and today our defenders have done a lot, protected almost the entire territory of Ukraine which suffered direct blows.\n\nThey also counterattacked occupied territories, for example Airport Hostomel, near Kyiv. This gives us confidence to hold our capitol, Kyiv. According to preliminary data, we have lost 137 of our heroes, our citizens. 10 of them are officers, wounded 316, all of our border guards on \"Snake Island\", defending to the last man. All the border guards- died, fighting heroically, but none of them surrendered. Every one of them will be awarded as the \"Hero of Ukraine\". Eternal memory to those who gave their lives for Ukraine.\n\n-moment of silence-\n\nI am grateful to everyone who saves people right now and helps maintain order in the state. The enemy bombs not only on the military targets they stated, but they also bomb civilians, they kill people and turn cities into military targets. This is pure evil and will never be forgiven.\n\nI know that a lot of misinformation is being thrown, a lot of fakes. IN particular, that I allegedly left Kyiv. I stay in the capital. I stay with the people. I had dozens of international talks during the day, directly ruled our state, and I stay in the capital Kyiv. My family is also in Ukraine, my children are also in Ukraine, my family are citizens in Ukraine. But I cannot say where they are, because according to our information, the enemy has marked me as a #1 target and my family as target #2.\n\nRussia wants to decapitate Ukraine politically by destroying its head of state. We have information that small tactical saboteur groups of the enemy have entered Kyiv, so I ask the citizens of Kiev, be attentive and follow curfew rules. I stay in the capital, I stay with people. I stay in the government quarter with everyone who is needed for the work of the central government.\n\nI have many conversations today with the leaders of different states. I heard the following. First: We are supported, and I am really grateful to every state which helps Ukraine by doing not just by talking. Second: We are left alone to defend our state. Who is ready to fight with us? Honestly ... I see no one. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO? Honestly...  everyone is scared.\n\nToday we heard from Moscow what they still want to negotiate on the neutral status of Ukraine. I say to all our allies, now is a turning point. The fate of our country is being decided. I ask them \"If you are with us?\", they answer that they \"with us\", but they are not ready to take us into an alliance with them. I asked the 27 leaders of Europe today whether Ukraine will join NATO, asked directly. Everyone is afraid and do not respond. And we are not afraid. We are not afraid of anything. We are not afraid to defend our country. We are not afraid of Russia. We are not afraid to talk to Russia. We are not afraid to talk about everything about security guarantees to our country. We are not afraid to talk about \"neutral\" status as we are not in NATO currently, but what security guarantees will we have? And most importantly, which specific countries will give them to us? We need to negotiate the end of this invasion, the end of this war, but now the fate of the country depends entirely on our army. Depends entirely on our heroes, from all our defenders, from our people, from your wisdom, and from the great support of our allies. \n\nGlory to Ukraine!",

You are brilliantly defending the country from one of the most powerful countries in the world.\nToday Russia attacked the entire territory of our state. And today our defenders have done a lot. They defended almost the entire territory of Ukraine, which suffered direct blows. They regain the one that the enemy managed to occupy. For example, Hostomel near Kyiv. This gives more confidence to the capital.\nAccording to preliminary data, unfortunately, we have lost 137 of our heroes today - our citizens. 10 of them are officers. 316 are wounded.\nOn our Zmiinyi Island, defending it to the last, all the border guards died heroically. But did not give up. All of them will be posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.\nMay the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine live forever.\nI am grateful to everyone who saves people right now and helps maintain order in the state.\nThe enemy strikes not only at military facilities, as it claims, but also at civilians. They kill people and turn peaceful cities into military targets. This is vile and will never be forgiven.\nI know that a lot of fakes are being produced now. In particular, that I allegedly left Kyiv. I stay in the capital, I stay with my people. During the day, I held dozens of international talks, directly managed our country. And I will stay in the capital. My family is also in Ukraine. My children are also in Ukraine. My family is not traitors. They are the citizens of Ukraine. But I have no right to say where they are now.\nAccording to our information, the enemy marked me as the number one target. My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the Head of State.\nWe also have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv. That's why I am asking Kyivites very much: be careful, follow the rules of curfew. I remain in the government quarter together with all those who are necessary for the work of the central government.\nNo matter how many conversations I had with the leaders of different countries today, I heard a few things. The first is that we are supported. And I am grateful to each state that helps Ukraine concretely, not just in words.\nBut there is another - we are left alone in defense of our state. Who is ready to fight with us? Honestly - I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO? Honestly, everyone is afraid.\nToday we heard from Moscow that they still want to talk. They want to talk about Ukraine's neutral status.\nI tell all the partners of our state: now is an important moment - the fate of our country is being decided. I ask them: are you with us? They answer that they are with us. But they are not ready to take us to the Alliance.\nToday, I asked the twenty-seven leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer.\nAnd we are not afraid of anything. We are not afraid to defend our state. We are not afraid of Russia. We are not afraid to talk to Russia. We are not afraid to say everything about security guarantees for our state. We are not afraid to talk about neutral status. We are not in NATO now. But the main thing - what security guarantees will we have? And what specific countries will give them?\nWe need to talk about the end of this invasion. We need to talk about a ceasefire.\nBut now the fate of the country depends entirely on our army, on our heroes, our security forces, all our defenders. And on our people, your wisdom and the great support of all friends of our country.\nGlory to Ukraine!",
