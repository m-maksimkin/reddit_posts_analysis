Not long ago in the United States many rivers and fisheries were desimated from pollution, over fishing and littered with trash. Many older fishermen did not even think about conservation or catch and release. Slowly first with fly fishing for trout and later, for bass and esox spices catch and release became a tool to help promote healty ecosystems. Fishing and outdoor activities are a huge industry and with the help of participants, non profits (trout unlimited), governmental bodies and clubs/organizations (B.A.S.S.), legislation has been passed multiple times on the state and federal level that has a direct positive impact on the environment ([Federal Aid in Sport Fishing](https://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/fasport.html)). We are in a much better place environmentally now in part to conservationist minded fishing (we have a long way to go with the environment too though, the is not over)\n\nRevenue from fishing licenses purchased by catch and release anglers are required to be used in a fashion that promotes conservation and supports the fishery and other open spaces. Again due to money that directly comes from catch and release fishing thousands of acres of land has been purchased that is now safe from development, deforestation and other damaging practices. You can look up the amount of land being purchased and projects going on that are majority funded by the licenses on your state's .gov website. \n\nTo address the mirco view of \"torture\" of fish, there are many popular and proven ways to greatly improve the fish mortality rate. Organizations like Trout Unlimited, B.A.S.S and even companies like Bass Pro Shops work hard to promote a culture of careful fish handling. Things like barbless hooks, single hooks, nets and keeping the fish in the water improve fish mortality significantly. If done correctly an experienced angler will rarely kill a fish. Many fishermen are some of the biggest advocates of conservation. People can enjoy fishing and protect native species at the same time due to catch and release. \n\nThe overall measureable benefits of catch and release to the environment outweighs the small percentage that unfortunately die and people need to open up to this. We would undoubtedly be in a worse place without catch and release.",

They discovered the scope was bad. They fixed the issue. He practiced a few shots and all was good. \n\nSo a week later he is back hunting and a buck walks through. Looks a bit thin and has a large mass on its face, so he figured he’d shoot it and then report it to DNR if it was a disease. \n\nClean shot first time and down it went. When he got to the deer and got a good look at the deers face. There was the tip of his arrow from the previous week in the deers jaw. The loud crack he heard was him hitting the poor deers jaw and shattering it. The area got all infected and swollen and the deer couldn’t eat. \n\nHe was just glad the same deer came back so he could put it out if it’s misery.",
