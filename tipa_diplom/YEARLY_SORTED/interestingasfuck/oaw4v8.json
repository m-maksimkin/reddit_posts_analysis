This results in animals suffering extremely miserable and painful lives even on free range/ humane farms. Artificial selection has led to a great increase in the speed with which broiler (meat) chickens develop and reach slaughter-weight. The time required to reach 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb) live-weight decreased from 120 days to 30 days between 1925 and 2005. Selection for fast early growth-rate, and feeding and management procedures to support such growth, have led to various welfare problems in modern broiler chickens. This leads to many health problems such as cardiovascular dysfunctions (sudden death syndrome - SDS), skeletal dysfunctions (There is a high frequency of skeletal problems in broilers, mainly in the locomotory system. These leg abnormalities impair the locomotor abilities of the birds, and lame birds spend more time lying and sleeping. The behavioural activities of broilers decrease rapidly from 14 days of age onwards. Most broiler chickens find simply walking to be painful, as indicated by studies using analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broiler",

I cringe every time I have to put these guys under anesthesia because their risk of death is higher.

Treating these guys is extremely stressful and even recovery from anesthesia can be tough due to their high risk of aspiration. \n\nI used to hate hate hate owners who got these dogs but I have since learned I cannot change who buys them. But i can educate them on the breed. I do corrective surgeries to open their airways and it brings me a lot of joy knowing I’m making a difference in a dogs life (it’s one of my favorite surgeries to do). I offer it to every single new brachycephalic owner and make sure they understand how difficult it is for these guys to breathe with this anatomy and the consequences of not doing the surgery. \n\nYou can’t fix stupid people who purchase these dogs sometimes for tens of thousands of dollars but you can at least educate.",

It's not a purebred Frenchie. \n\nBut nose length is a farce anyways and has little to do with how well a dog can breathe. What you want to see is open nares and a BOAS score. Usually it's the length of the soft palate and not the length of the nose that is the culprit in breathing issues. Well bred Frenchies (from health tested and titled parents) can breathe and do activities just fine. The problem is 90%+ of Frenchies you see are from backyard breeders or mills who couldn't give two shits if your puppy can't breathe cause they've already got your money.

            "text": "Okay, SO. There is a lot of misinformation flying around this thread about the AKC and who sets the breed standards that lead to the above. The AKC does not create the breed standard for any breed, they are the overarching organization that handles registration. The breed standard for every breed is developed by the breed club for each one - in my breed, the German Shepherd Dog Club of America. In purebred dog circles, the culture dramatically varies by breed but one common note between most of them is a modern emphasis on genetic testing for common diseases, and standardized evaluations on hips, elbows, heart, ears, and eyes. The list varies by breed and is managed by the OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) via their CHIC program (Canine Health Information Center).\n\nNow, depending on the breed and its relative health status you will find some really interesting efforts to improve breed health - for instance in Dalmatians there is an outcross program with pointers intended to improve genetic diversity in the breed and reduce the occurrence of certain genetic issues as the gene that carries the spots can also cause deafness. Really GOOD preservation takes health, temperament, conformation, and adherence to the historical purpose of the breed super seriously. \n\nAs far as Frenchies and the standard for what the head shape should look like goes, that's not my breed. I'm into working line GSDs, which might as well be the other side of the planet as far as purebred dogs are concerned. But the reason these dogs look the way they do is people buy them. They're great apartment dogs, they're cute as fuck, they have a fun personality, and its highly predictable that that's the dog you'll get if you go get a Frenchie. But finding a healthy one is hard and it is my experience as an advocate for ethical purebred dog breeding that the first question your average pet shopper asks is \"How much for a puppy?\" then they stare at you in pure sticker shock when they find out how much a well-bred puppy actually costs. So they go buy a cheaper one whose parents WEREN'T health tested, thus incentivizing shitty breeding. It's as much a market-side issue as it is a cultural issue within dog breeding itself.",

His puppy couldn’t keep up with mine. He wanted so badly to play, and run, and have fun with the other dogs, but he would start to weeze very quickly, and before he was even a year old developed painful warts on his paws that keep coming back after multiple surgeries. \n\nI hate telling my dad “I told you so”, but I just really want him to fucking see what he is perpetuating.

We have Pugs and a French Bulldog only one came as a rescue from a legit for profit breeder and that was because they couldn’t breed him with the pugs they had left as he was related.

My clinic sees so many backyard bred Frenchies, bred by selfish people who probably didn’t even pass high school biology, because they’re the new, trendy money maker. \n\nThese dogs are always horribly bred. We never see the adult dogs until the breeder brings the female in for a progesterone test to see if it’s time to breed yet, or when it’s time to euthanize. The puppies are born already struggling to breath. As most need c-sections, anesthesia is a nightmare for both mother and pups due to their squished faces and squat body conformation. C-sections in a “normal” dog, are time sensitive as you don’t want pups exposed to anesthetic gas for too long, it’s even worse when the mother and pups can’t breathe properly. Then you feel bad taking the ET tube out afterward because that’s the best that dog has ever been able to breathe. \n\nThese people make at LEAST $2,000 per pup, yet come into my clinic and tell me they have no money for basic care. Their adult animals never have vaccinations, health screen blood work, or any basic care, and the pups? Sold as soon as possible with no health exams or shots. \n\nJust last week I had an owner bring in his new Frenchie puppy because he was limping. Turns out this 7 month old pup already has degenerative disc disease and will need to be on pain meds the rest of his life(Frenchies can also be prone to spinal issues due to breeding to make them more short and stocky looking). \n\nI once had one of these breeders have a female with a broken leg. We needed to change the splint and take X-rays to make sure the bone was healing correctly.

            "text": "They are literally doing this to horses in recent years. I guess now that horses aren’t really “needed” for actual things besides companions and sports people are starting to select disgusting traits to pass down. I’ll pop the link of the article somewhere. Arabian horses are much like this dog, they have a funky face, smaller face and wide nostrils and they’re sought after for these traits. Recently they’ve decided they need a bigger dip in their face for cosmetic reasons. Arabian sport horses aren’t seeing this new trend but horses that are used for halter shows (no riding or endurance) are seeing this new trend. Vets currently find no issues with this horse’s conformation or abilities to breathe correctly but I feel and the author feels that this could be a problem down the road. My childhood pony was an Arabian welsh pony, she didn’t have a large dip in her face, he face was dainty with large eyes and large nostrils. The farm I grew up training to ride on bred American quarter horses. They were a specific line of quarter horses that were used for sport and dressage and they largely resembled thoroughbreds with long legs and a body that was slim. Take a moment to look up American quarter horses and halter quarter horses. Big square bodies and super tiny heads. The discrepancy between the head and body is disgusting. There has got to be issues waiting ahead for how these horses are being bred. Not only that, these horses are made to run with their heads almost dragging the ground. I at one time was on the conversation about quarter horses with another trainer at another facility and I said I don’t like the way they look, I feel it is unpractical to have a horse shaped like they are now and it’s ugly. This trainer was a pure inbred local redneck who simply said “they’re cute that way” okay cute doesn’t mean functional and safe for the life of the animal. Quarter horses were known for their speed, some quarter horses do come out tanky looking, we have one that was bred by our sport quarter horse mentioned before and she’s wide and a cute head but it’s..normal looking and not exaggerated. Both of her parents were the sporty type and the mother was actually smaller in frame. But yeah, people are fucking trash for doing this to animals. It’s bad enough these animals have to rely on us for survival and now we’re absolutely not doing them favors by allowing this to happen. We should be improving their lives not making it worse. We’re not a species meant to survive I guess.[here is the article](https://horseyhooves.com/el-rey-magnum-arabian-horse-breeding/)",

Still distinct if the name of the game is about looks, I would absolutely recognize that dog as a bull dog variant.
