That pushes the bag open with momentum, which then pulls in additional air. If he cut off the piece of the bag near his mouth and blew through that the same way, he wouldn't send as much air through the opening, even though the Bernoulli principle would be equally at work. It's the closed bag being pushed open that draws a lot of the air in.\n\nE: Folks with the downvotes, what's up? If you disagree, by all means reply, I'm open to being wrong about it.",

The wing is shaped in such a way that when the air is split at the front of the wing the air over the wing will have to move faster than the air under it, creating lower pressure.",
