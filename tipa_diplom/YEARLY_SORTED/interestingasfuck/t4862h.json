Please don't be a hypocrite if your country did a similar thing.\n\nAnd for people and governments from powerful countries, please this world is not yours to play, be respectful to each other country and other countries are not your pawn. NATO was founded to fight against the USSR, but the Alliance is still there when the USSR collapsed. So we can conclude that NATO is an alliance to fight against Russia and the CSTO, so when NATO offered a lot of ex-soviet countries to join them, it kinda playing with fire and they know it. The people from ex-soviet countries will suffer first as you can see from the Ukraine case right now.\n\nSame as in the Pacific area with the AUKUS thing to fight China. The people who will suffer are not rich, developed, and powerful countries but people from those areas are treated as a pawn. I know a lot of people on this platform are from those powerful countries. From what i know (maybe wrong) people who are capable to escape as a refugee first, usually are the rich and powerful, they left behind their middle class and poor countrymen to suffer while they profiteering from the exposure and \"the pity\". \n\nSo please again, don't be a hypocrite if your government also did a similar thing in this past two decades. Condemnation on this invasion is right and must be encourage but you also must see if the side that you are on is also have some hands in this kind of conflicts. \n\nShame on you people on every government that rarely represent the will of ordinary people but often benefiting the little group of rich and powerful people.",

Now, some people here are commenting how some of these countries haven't done their fair part even if they're against Russia invasion, you gotta remember that some of them are still under some sort of control by Russia and they can't do too much too fast cause then they will get punished by daddy Putin.
