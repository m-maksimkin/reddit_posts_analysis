Eventually, you'll have to pay a monthly premium to not advertise on your vehicle. There is no one in the world that needs this. No one. For any reason. \n\nThis is a huge waste of engineering effort, time, and manpower. There's so much more we need in this world, not a fucking BMW that changes color.... How about we fix batteries so they last longer or become more sustainable? Or come up with new fuel sources so we don't have to live underwater in the next few years? Sounds like to me BMW is going to wait until real engineers solve problems that matter. \n\nFuck you, BMW. This tech is nothing but a $$$$$$ grab.",
