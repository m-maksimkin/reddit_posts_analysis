Each flush of toilet tends to take at least 5 litre of water (that depends on the manufacturer), but only water used in washing hands is reused, which a few websites estimates to be 1 gallon (3.78 L). Either way it's not too far off, and let's say, conservatively, that 3L of water is saved every time.

This just the water from the tank into the bowl . The bowl by design will auto flush once enough water pressure builds ( try pouring a bucket of water just into the bowl ) it will flush on its own without you having to hit the flusher . Main point im making is the water from washing your hands will just go into the overflow and into the bowl regardless . A quick wash of hands for a few seconds and this saves some water . Anything more than a few seconds and your going through near the same amount of water and it will just auto flush anyways . There must be more by design i cannot see .",
