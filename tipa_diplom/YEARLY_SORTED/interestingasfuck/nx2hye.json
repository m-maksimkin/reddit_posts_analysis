(bksonntag@ThisIsToPreventSpam-902-RemoveThis.cs.com) on 1 Nov 2002 at 10:36:58 PM\nIn-Reply-To: famous demolition of swastika posted by Chad on 9:47:58 AM 13 Mar 2002\n\nno Chad,\nI think the swastika in question is the one seen in that famous newsreel footage of the swastika on the roof of a building being blown to bits. If this is the one which is the subject of the question, it wasn't in Munich but Berlin and the hated swastika was on the roof of the Reichstag and was blown off by the Red Army with an anti-tank gun. The Red Army (or more accurately, \"the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\" as it was called) were the ones who blew it off the roof and I believe it was a female Red Army sniper who was awarded the honor of firing the shot that is seen in the footage. In larger terms, taking the Reichstag itself, the objective of all objectives, was awarded to Zhukov's 1st Byelorussian Front as opposed to Koniev's 1st Ukranian, because Zhukov's front had won the race for Berlin; the demarcation line between those two fronts would run just 150 meters west of the symbolic seat of Nazi tyranny. But to the artillery of 1st Byelorussian Front the Reichstag was simply 'Target #105'. The honor of actually assulting it was given to regiments of the 150th and 171st Rifle Divisions, which belonged to 79th Rifle Corps. So, at around 1200 hrs. on 30 April of '45, under a swathe of covering fire from machine guns, heavy guns, Katyusha multiple rocket launchers, and even captured Panzerfausts, brave Red Army soldiers careened across the open ground in front of the Reichstag and up the central staircase. At 1425 hrs. Sergeants Yegorov and Kantariya flew the Red Victory Banner from the second floor, and at 2250 hrs. (though there were still some Germans inside and it was not 100% cleared until 2 May) it was finally raised above the roof. Weidling's Berlin garrison surendered on 2 May (and Germany itself on 7th May to the western Allies and on 8th May to the Soviets). Thus ended the so-called \"Thousand Year Reich\" and because she bore by far the brunt of the fighting (and the casualties) and were the ones who really broke the back of the Wehrmacht, the Soviet Union can be rightfully credited with destroying Nazi Germany, much more so than the U.S. and Britain put together.\n-Billy S.",

            "text": "I highly recommend watching [\"Judgement at Nuremberg\" Directed by Stanley Kramer (1961)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055031/). Very compelling movie that is super relevant to what's going on today. Spencer Tracy at his finest. Also a great performance from an older Judy Garland. She died eight years after the release of this movie. This film starts with this video footage of the Swastika being blown up.",
