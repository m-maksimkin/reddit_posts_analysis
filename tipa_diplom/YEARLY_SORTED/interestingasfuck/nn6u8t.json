Is it as simple as wind/animals brining dust/dirt/seeds that slowly accumulate, then sprout plant life, inevitably gaining a foothold from which to continue spreading? Like, those seats were covered to a point where jagged steps become a forested gradient slope. That‚Äôs a decent amount of material they had to excavate. Maybe earthquakes/landslides contribute as well, but only if the region is seismically active/has poor soil retention/heavy rainfall?",
