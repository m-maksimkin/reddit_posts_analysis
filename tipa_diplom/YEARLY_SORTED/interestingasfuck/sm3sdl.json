Allow me to shed some light on this.\n\nYou are probably aware that animals are not capable of human language, so they all evolve their own way of communicating.\n\nA lot of animals have tails, so they use their tail to talk.\n\nBut that's kind of confusing, because there isn't a universal rule about what the tail means.\n\nDog waving their tail?  Means that's a happy dog.\n\nRattlesnake waving their tail?  Doesn't necessarily mean it's not a happy rattlesnake.  He might have just molted, gotten laid, ate a impressively large gopher and be thinking \"Buddy I don't have to do shit for the next two years except slither onto a warm rock sometimes.  I got nothing to worry about except for the occasional Bald Eagle that thinks HE'S hot shit enough to be put on a country's flag.  So...watch your fucking step.\"\n\nThat should give you pause.\n\nYou should wonder \"Oh, do mammals and reptiles communicate in fundamentally different ways.\"\n\nAnd the answer is: Sorta.

Didn't eat, didn't want to do much of anything.\n\nWell during my time with him, I played with him, introduced him to my dogs, took him almost everywhere I went, and showed him the same love I did the dogs.

He would bolt to my direction both in and out of his tank, and knew my voice apart from others!

It had no reaction to anyone other than her, even if she was across the room; as soon as she was in the room, he would rush to the closest wall of his tank, stand on his tippy toes, and 'walk' along the side of the tank to stay in line of sight with her as much as possible. He would rush to her hands, and loved being cleaned by her - she washed him every couple days by holding him under lukewarm running water, and scrubbing him all over with a soft-bristled tooth brush. He would extend his neck and every limb as far as possible, and close his eyes for the entire duration, in an expression of what - though I cannot read a turtle's mind - could only be read as utter contentment and bliss. He fled, turned away from, or showed outright aggressive behavior to any other being to approach his tank, never mind allowing any kind of direct handling. He would struggle and kick, or draw everything in and freeze up. But that turtle trusted and adored my mother.   \n\n\nSadly, her constantly assuming the best of animals and believing that she really could communicate with them meant that she over trusted our dog, a terrier that had grown up on a lake and had spent many happy days killing any small animal that came out of the water, and the turtle met a terrible and bloody end when mom left it within reach of the dog - and without proper supervision - for less than a minute.",

My mom picked it up and we had him for a long time after that. My mom would let him roam around our house and when she called his name he would get up on something high to tell her where he was. He was spoiled haha. She would carry him in her bags and take him into town with her and he would peek his little head out of the bag to look around. She let him sleep under her pillow every night to keep him warm. Lol yeah that’s my mom haha. He was just really unique and very smart. She would rub this hoof stuff on his shell so it would shine haha. She loved that guy and he was a pretty cool tortoise. He was such a unique color and he was so little too. One day my mom told my little brothers to go let him get some sun outside and to watch him. My brothers got distracted and our sweet little Franklin ran away and was gone forever. We looked and looked for him, called his name, but nothing. He’d been with us for so long we hoped he remembered how to be out in the wild. I would look for him everyday for quite a while. We lived out in the country in Missouri and there were so many acres, no telling where he went. I’ve never seen another one like him either and I still miss him to this day!",

He hangs out in the front room a lot and when I come home from work he rushes towards me and sits on my shoes, it’s very cute like a dog. If he’s in a calm/tired mood he will sit on you and push himself under your clothes/joints and sleep. He also circles around the fridge sometimes as he knows this is where his treats live. \n\nHe’s come so far we bought him off a family who got him for their kids but they got bored of him after a while. They didn’t bother with UV or letting him out of even proper nutrition. He couldn’t use his back legs really they just limply dragged behind him. I’m so glad we found him (this was 6 years ago)",

Instead, he was in a very busy area and thrived. He got occasionally startled, but was generally very cool.

I honestly never questioned it... he lives on vegetables and fruit and was rescued just amateurly back in the day (to own one these days is not even legal here). We don't know his real age but he is older than my mom so over 60 and we think around 70/80... we only knew its a him for sure when I was small and had another tortoise for sleepover! She popped his cherry and he was in love with her we actually had to put them separate 😂 Sadly she is not alive anymore 🥺\n\nAlso he does his business in the morning when not in wintersleep and mostly does not break this toilet habit.

She would continue to show up once a week in the middle of the day and would let us feed her.  I'm so glad my mother documented this and took as many photos as she did, I really need to find them.\n\nShe even began to wait for me to come home from school.  It was common to see her come running down out of the woods when the school bus would drop me off and would meet me before I walked into the house.  I loved her so much.\n\nThere was also a time I had a manatee swim up to me in Florida and just poke it's head up while I was kneeling down looking into the ocean next to our little seaside motel.  Their skin feels so much like an elephant's.  Incredibly graceful creatures.\n\nSome of us just have that natural magnetism that animals have an attraction to.  Maybe they have an ability to see some aura or pheremone we emit that tells them we are worth their trust.\n\nRegardless, always great to see another lover of animals.",

What they found was that over generations, certain regions of their brains were getting bigger which encouraged dog-like behavior in the foxes. More interestingly, the foxes started to develop dog-like color patterns and even lost their signature foxy stink.\n\nI am in no way a scientist, but judging from the history of dog domestication along with the fox experiment, I'm drawing the conclusion that the same evolutionary pattern is starting to happen in this man's turtle.

Maybe most. \n\nPlease note that turtles shouldn't be for long on the floor, expetialy naked or carpet floor.

I’ve also had an iguana and a ball python and they were both very affectionate so I don’t think it’s that unusual. They can identify a lot of things with their human caregivers - food, warmth, scratches - and then correlate that with affection.\n\nI’m not doubting what you said, and it’s a really cool turtle, I just wanna point out that reptiles can be a lot more affectionate than people expect when they’re raised correctly. Clearly you did things right with the turtle because he identifies you as a source of all those positive things.",

Gonna give my best “explanation” based on my knowledge and experience.\n\nThe life of an animal in human care is drastically different than one in the wild. There, everything revolves around survival. Finding food, mates, shelter, etc.\n\nHowever, they don’t really have to do any of that in human care. We provide everything for them.\n\nNow, take an animal with a higher level of cognitive sophistication, like your turtle. They’re no longer using they’re brain power on a constant basis in the same way. So what does this leave them to do with all those turtle thoughts?\n\nHard to say. We don’t understand the level of thought that goes on within their mind compared to ours. But, we know for a fact it’s there. Depending on the animal, they may just adapt their natural behaviors into something more usable in their natural environment.\n\nExample: lizards bobbing their heads in terrariums. Even though we’re not part of their environment, we’re a reasonable stand in for other animals and it feels natural to them.\n\nThat being said, sometimes weird stuff happens. Animals may develop behavior we’ve never seen before by chance. Or they learn something in human care and adapt it to their needs. \n\nPlaying is a great example of this. Some animals will play in the wild and in captivity, but some have only been seen to do it in human care.\n\nThis could be a version of play with your turtle. There’s not any natural behaviors that necessarily translate to what they’re doing, but it may be something they find stimulating anyway. That’s really the definition of play.\n\nSo there you go. Sorry for the wordy response, but I figured you might be interested.",
