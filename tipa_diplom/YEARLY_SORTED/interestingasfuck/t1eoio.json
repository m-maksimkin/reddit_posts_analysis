We don‚Äôt want too see what they are truely capable of and it‚Äôs disgusting that Ukraine would fight over border territories that are ethnically and historically Russian lands.

Plebiscite would have been the preferable option and acting like it‚Äôs some heroic thing to offer up the young men of Ukraine to the meat grinder is disgusting. We should be truely anti war and this could have been solved diplomatically but Ukraine was unwilling to allow that from happening. I curse Volodymyr Zelenskyy for sending young men to die for his own selfish gain. He has no care for Ukrainian people he is not even Ukrainian himself.

If not from Poland at all, as Comrade Avakov does\n\nDo you still have tanks and bayraktars? We apologize for the shortcomings of our command, we are trying to correct this. At the moment, it's not even the military district that's at war with you, it's just a part of it, in which case we can launch a more full-scale offensive, and you, again, will have the opportunity to make your threats come true if you don't die before you notice our guys. \n\nAfter all, our guys held the airport near Kiev, only 200 Russians were in the very rear of you, and you could not squeeze them out and thanks to this we are already storming Kiev. Maybe it was worth saying \"your ass is in our hands\" and \"we're going to kick you out\" a little earlier? \n\nI really hope that your colleagues share your fighting spirit, because so far we have not met adequate resistance. \n\nBest wishes\n\nRussian occupier\n\n\nP.S. Killing 8 years of peaceful people in the Donbass just because they considered themselves Russians, you should have understood that the hour of reckoning would come sooner or later. Our military do not have claims against the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, lay down your weapons and you are guaranteed life. \n\nTo militants of nationalist formations who execute their own soldiers for not wanting to fight and hide from us behind the civilian population, as well as those who have committed numerous war crimes, I advise you to pray and look for a place in the cemetery",

This guy is pronouncing the word what as \"sho\" instead of \"shto\", which is Ukrainian-Russian pidgin. Actual Ukrainian pronunciation is \"shcho.\" I also heard \"dumayete\" (think) pronounced the Ukrainian way, Russian would be \"dumayetye.\" Another sign, which I didn't hear in this video, is how Ukrainians tend to pronounce the \"g\" sound. There is a hard G in the Ukrainian alphabet, but it's rarely used. Ukrainians pronounce it like a voiced \"h\".

The moon shines in the midst of the sky; the immeasurable vault of heaven seems to have expanded to infinity; the earth is bathed in silver light; the air is warm, voluptuous, and redolent of innumerable sweet scents. Divine night! Magical night! Motionless, but inspired with divine breath, the forests stand, casting enormous shadows and wrapped in complete darkness. Calmly and placidly sleep the lakes surrounded by dark green thickets. The virginal groves of the hawthorns and cherry-trees stretch their roots timidly into the cool water; only now and then their leaves rustle unwillingly when that freebooter, the night-wind, steals up to kiss them. \n\nThe whole landscape is hushed in slumber; but there is a mysterious breath upon the heights. One falls into a weird and unearthly mood, and silvery apparitions rise from the depths. Divine night! Magical night! Suddenly the woods, lakes, and steppes become alive. The nightingales of Ukraine are singing, and it seems as though the moon itself were listening to their song. The village sleeps as though under a magic spell; the cottages shine in the moonlight against the darkness of the woods behind them. The songs grow silent, and all is still. Only here and there is a glimmer of light in some small window. Some families, sitting up late, are finishing their supper at the thresholds of their houses.‚Äù Nikolai Gogol, A May Night.",

Everyone who grew up in peace seems to forget that in times of war it is what rallies the troops and keeps people alive and the enemy in fear.  It is the strength and backbone of a defense.

Subduing and weakening boys to disengage from physical activity, sports, being competitive, and embracing traits that project strength would leads to weakness.  I applaud Ukraine for letting g boys be boys and allowing them the strength to defend their families.
