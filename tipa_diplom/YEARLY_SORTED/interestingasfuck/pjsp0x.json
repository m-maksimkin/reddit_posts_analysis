            "text": "This is actually somewhat of my dream set up for my dream home. Not necessarily a timber frame house in a wooden barn, but more like an inconspicuous house inside another structure, kept safe from the sun but perhaps with an open top. \n\n\nSee this in Paris, where I work, a lot. My job often takes me to those hidden gems of houses of all sizes and shapes nestled and hidden in the space in between other buildings, only accessible through a large, typical Parisian wooden door/gate hybrid they used back in the day to bring their coaches and later even cars through. Sometimes even then you'll have to look around to find them. Very interesting. Sometimes not too different from the type of mews you'd find in London, but far more charming and hidden. Plus, they keep the heat away rather well, which I love. You won't get much sunlight into those, if any at all, but that to me isn't an issue, it's an advantage.",
