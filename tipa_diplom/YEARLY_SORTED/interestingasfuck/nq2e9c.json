The lactose was run through granulation machines which had been previously cleaned.  Since the lactose was clean, it was deemed acceptable to be donated to local farmers to enhance their cattle feed.  \n\nA particular farmer also kept bees at his farm.  He stored the donated lactose in an area that his bees were able to access.  As a result of the bees consuming the lactose, their honey was cloudy.  Even though the lactose had been donated to the farmer, he argued that his harvest for the year had been ruined.  He demanded cash for his crop.  The company recompensed the farmer for his entire season's honey production which totaled about 20 five gallon pails.\n\nThe company destroyed the honey.",
