Um, if you weren't lazy people and were watching whats going on, you can see the footage of the bombing taken today. I watched a few live streams of events and this bombing was one of them. More so one the missiles launched to take out airports and what not, ended up hitting this building. Heck there are even links to multiple confirmed reports about this incident.   \n\n\nTo be fair maybe the dumb Redditors are Russian bots. In that case, they sure got a ton of bots.",

            "text": "Apparently China is backing Russia. This is not going to end well for Russia. 1st of all they have the gdp of texas and war is very expensive, Russia is also a facing a massive population decline, that's one of the reason putin is so eager to annex. Their birthrate has gone to shit. Ukraine army is battle hardened. They might lose to Russia but its going to cost Russia a lot of bodies, bodies they can't afford. And after they finally beat Ukraine their coffers will be borderline empty and their military would have been affected heavily. That's when China is gonna show its true face and stab them in the back. The same way the Germans stabbed Russia in the back in world war 2. People seem to forget Russia was supporting the nazis until the nazis turned on them. Stay tuned.",

If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.\n\nGet to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.\n\nMessage any of us we will be checking.\n\nStay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.\n\nMay Putin burn to dust.\n\n***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.\n\nTry to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.\n\nAnother user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:\n\nThis is a copy and paste and I encourage you all to do it too where appropriate!
