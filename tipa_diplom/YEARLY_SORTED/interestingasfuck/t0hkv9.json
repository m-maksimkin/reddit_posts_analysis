Everyone is at fault and everyone is paying for it.\n\nWhat he should be asking is why does he know russian? Why does half his country speak russian natively, and why ukraine wants independence when at least 50% of their culture is shared with russia. To me, as someone who looks from the outside as a ukranian, there is no difference between the two nations. Both are full of stupid leaders, and both people's should let the countries unite then collectively over throw both governments (or one government, since the unification will make it easier to over throw one rather than 2 governments).\n\nWhat ukranians don't understand is that their previous leader sold them out to russia, and this leader sold them out to the west. Both are farming them for free influence, resources, and using them as a bargaining chip to play their politics.\n\nMore lies please. We know how it goes, we have been lied to since the Tsar.\n\nIf you want peace, get out of russia, get out of ukraine, get out of belarus, you are probably better of in china, how ironic.",

My half-sister. She's 10, for fuck's sake. They managed to get it, but that was the easy part. Once he gets home he has to pack what he can and then drive north and get to the border, avoiding warzones, and keep driving until he gets to England.\n\nI'm fucking terrified for him, can't imagine how he feels. He's having to leave his mother-in-law and stepson at home because they won't be able to get in to the UK. The mother-in-law just lost her husband 2 weeks ago after a long battle with cancer.\n\nI don't know why I'm writing this.

            "text": "Full transcript of the subtitles here (typed it for a lesson for my class):\n\nToday, I initiated a phone call with the president of the Russian Federation. The result? Silence. Although the silence should be in Donbas. That is why I come today with an appeal to tall citizens of Russian. Not as President. I am appealing to the people of Russia as a citizen of Ukraine. We share more than 2000km of border. Around it, today, is your army: almost 200,000 soldiers, thousands of military units. \r  \n\r  \nYour leadership has approved their movement towards us. Towards the territory of another country. This step? This step can become the start of a huge war on the European continent. The whole world is talking about what can happen any day now. A reason can appear at any moment. \r  \nAny provocation. Any spark. A spark that has the potential of burning everything down. \r  \n\r  \nYou are told that this flame will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine. But the people of Ukraine are already free. \r  \n\r  \nThey remember their past, and are building their future. They are building it, not destroying it, as you are told every day on TV. Ukraine in your news and Ukraine in reality are two completely different countries. The most important difference is that ours is real. \r  \n\r  \nYou are being told that we are Nazis. But how can a nation be called Nazist after sacrificing more than 8 million lives to eradicate Nazism. How can I be a Nazi, when my grandfather survived the whole war as part of the Soviet infantry, and died a colonel in an independent Ukraine. You are told that we hate Russian culture. But how can a culture be hated? Any culture? Neighbors are always enriching each other culturally. Yet, that does not make them one entity, and does not separate people into ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúthem‚Äù.\r  \n\r  \nWe are different, but that is not a reason to be enemies. We want to build our own history. Peacefully. Calmly. Truthfully. \r  \n\r  \nYou are told that I am ordering to attack Donbas. To shoot. To bomb without question. Although there are questions: To shoot who? To bomb what?\r  \n\r  \nDonetsk? Where I have been dozens of times? I have seen their faces and eyes. \r  \nArtema? Where I‚Äôve walked with friends before?\r  \nDonbas Arena? Where I have rooted with the locals for our boys during the Euros?\r  \nShcherbakova Park? Where we drank together after our team lost?\r  \nLugansk? The home of my best friend‚Äôs mom? The place where his father is buried?\r  \n\r  \nNote that I am now speaking in Russian, yet no one in Russia understands what these names, streets, and events mean. This is all foreign to you. Unknown. This is our land. This is our history. What are you going to fight for? And against whom? Many of you have visited Ukraine before. Many of you have relatives in Ukraine. \r  \n\r  \nSome of you studied in our universities. Befriended Ukrainians. You know our character, you know our people, you know our principles. You know what we cherish the most. Look inside you, listen to the voice of reason, of common sense. Hear our voices. The people of Ukraine want peace. Ukrainian authorities want peace. We want it, and we make it. We do everything in our power. \r  \n\r  \nWe are not alone. It‚Äôs true. Ukraine is support by many countries. Why? Because we are not talking about ‚Äúpeace at any cost.‚Äù We are talking about peace, and about principles, justice. About everyone‚Äôs right to define their own future, of safety, and everyone‚Äôs right to live without threat. \r  \n\r  \nAll of this is important to us. All of this is important for peace. I know this is also important for you. We know for sure that we don‚Äôt want war. Not cold, not hot, not hybrid. But if we are threatened, if someone tries to take away our country, our freedom, our lives. The lives of our children. We are going to defend ourselves. \r  \n\r  \nNot attack‚Äîdefend. By attacking us, you are going to see our faces. Not backs‚Äîour faces. \r  \n\r  \nWar is a big distress, and it has a big price, in all meanings of this word. People lose their money, reputation, quality of life, freedom, and most importantly, people lose their loved ones. Lose themselves. \r  \n\r  \nA lot of things are always lacking in war. But what is in abundance is pain, dirt, blood, and death. Thousands, tens of thousands of deaths. \r  \n\r  \nYou are told that Ukraine is a threat to Russia. This was not true before, not now, and won‚Äôt be in the future.  You want security guarantees from NATO. We also want guarantees of our security. The security of Ukraine‚Äîfrom you, from Russia, and from other guarantors of the Budapest memorandum. Today, we are not part of random security alliances. The security of Ukraine is tied to the security of our neighbors. That is why are now talking about the security of all Europe. But our main goal is peace in Ukraine, and the safety of our citizens. Of Ukrainians. \r  \n\r  \nWe are determined to let everyone know about this, including you. War is going to deprive everyone of guarantees. No one will have guarantees of security. Who is going to suffer from this most? The people. Who doesn‚Äôt want this more than anyone? The people. Who can prevent all this from happening? The people. \r  \n\r  \nIf these people are among you‚ÄîI am sure they are. Public figures, journalists, musicians, actors, athletes, scientists, doctors, bloggers, stand-ups. Tiktokers, and more. Ordinary people. Ordinary, simple people. Men, women, old young, fathers, and most importantly‚Äîmothers. \r  \n\r  \nJust as much as the people in Ukraine, not matter how much they try to convince of the opposite. I know that my speech will not be aired on Russian television. But the citizens of Russia have to see it. They need to know the truth.  And the truth is, that this needs to stop, before it‚Äôs too late. And if the authorities of Russian don‚Äôt want to talk to us, for the sake of peace, maybe they will talk to you. \r  \n\r  \nDo the people of Russian want war? I would like to be able to answer this. But the answer depends only on you: the citizens of the Russian Federation. Thank you.",
