That means (assuming my math is correct) to recoup from their single one way flight (0.285 * 88 * 4500 = 112,860 Kg CO2), I would have to NOT drive (112,860 / ( 0.055 * 4 ) = 513,000 km) AROUND THE ENTIRE EARTH 12.8 times (circumference of earth is ~40,000 km).  \n\nAlternatively, assuming my daily commute is 100km (62mi), that is 5,130 days of commuting!  Or ~20 years.\n\nSo, I can just not drive for 20 years or some rich fuck can not fly his plane once.  I'm really hoping my math is wrong because that just shows there's no point in even trying.",
