We fucked up dogs with breeding for characteristics. Natural selection happens for a reason. \n\nIf someone makes themselves infertile with horse de-wormer, I think we should allow Darwinism to do its job. Just because advancements in science make longer lives possible and idiots to survive and breed doesn't mean we should. We're overpopulating our only habitable planet, and as a society we're held back from social progress by selfish science nay-sayers (anti-vax, flat-earth, racists). \n\nNot all infertility is because of idiocy, but maybe there's a good reason a person is infertile. Maybe there's something in their genetic makeup that nature thinks shouldn't continue for the health of our species. \n\nI do feel for the couples who are desperate for children and want to find a way. I don't think they necessarily shouldn't have kids. I do think we, as a species, need to be a bit less hung up on our egos wanting to pass on our own genes. I'm guilty of it too. Couldn't more of us adopt? There are plenty of kids who need a home. But like a lot of people, I wanted my own. \n\nAlthough, is there still a good reason in nature for wanting your own?

The results from the analysis they did on the count and quality was not good, it seems for some reason she was essentially infertile prior to even starting her transition. Perhaps it was tight underwear or smoking, but regardless, we have at least enough sperm for in vitro.\n\nI haven’t yet started taking hormones due to lack of funds to store my own gametes. Where we could largely use the stimulus payments to cover her sperm banking, in order to extract and store my eggs we’re looking at closer to $6-10k. My eggs will be rendered useless once I start hormone replacement therapy to transition from female to male, so I must put off my medical transition indefinitely in order to have my own children.\n\nBefore you ask, I don’t feel dysphoria about carrying a pregnancy or giving birth, and may even surrogate for a gay friend of mine to make sure everything works down there prior to putting our entire future into our own kids. Growing up with stories in the news about the pregnant man who did reciprocal ivf for his wife made me hopeful, and reassures me that its a very manly thing to do 😎",
