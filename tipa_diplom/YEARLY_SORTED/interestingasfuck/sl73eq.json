I've been scanned myself for well over 100 hours, and have scanned other people several times that. It's actually quite difficult to stay awake in a scanner at time.  You can use eye tracking devices or behavioral tasks to tell when people fall asleep. True, it is noisy at the very center of the machine, but we use ear plugs, foam padding, noise canceling headphones, and other tricks to reduce that  down to a subtle rhythmic sound, which itself can be hypnotizing. As well, your head is packed into memory foam to keep it from moving around too much, but can be very comforting and relaxing. The room is cold from the chillers keeping equipment at optimal temperature (electromagnet), so you always have the option of a medical blanket, and most people will take off their shoes and wear comfortable clothing if  they are used to getting scanned.\n\nIt's hard to stay awake in the scanner, its just that most experimenters consider data collected from people who fall asleep during functional scans to be garbage b/c they're looking for what happens in the brain when you're awake/behaving/perceiving/etc.",

I’d say pregnancy helped too. \n\nI figured that even if it didn’t work, I needed some help with my neck and shoulders anyway so what the heck…\n\nThe rain stick sound has gone.\n\nWeird.\n\nEdit: additional sentence",

It was something that if I focused on it would snap me out of it and I would revert back to normal consciousness, but if I just let myself experience it I could play around in this state. The describe the transition is almost like I was mentally confined in a smaller space, like as if the room shrunk and wrapped around the space of my head. Anyway in this state I was able to visualize anything with a lot more clarity than my normal mental state. \n\nAfter a while there was some other transition that happened, but this one was way more of a physical experience. It sounded like a swoosh making its way into my head, and I experience a sort of pulsing. It may have been this spinal fluid cleaning this out.

CSF pulsations are frequently seen on brain MRI (specifically, on a routine part of the scan called FLAIR sequence), but are rarely mentioned in diagnostic reports because they are a normal process. It is actually possible to quantify CSF flow through natural bottlenecks like the cerebral aqueduct  or foramen magnum using advanced techniques like phase contrast which is occasionally used in certain disease states.\n\nAs far as I can tell the video is a kind of computer reconstruction image that maps csf flow over brain anatomy similar to how functional MRI studies are presented rather than any kind of standard diagnostic method.\n\nIt would be interesting to see more such studies of CSF pulsations in normal people rather than seeing it as a normal incidental finding on brain MRI",
