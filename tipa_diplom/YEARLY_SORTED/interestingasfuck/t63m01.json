Most of our military equipment is either based on fighting an insurgency or is as old as the crap the Russians are using. We’re sending M72s. WTF, M72s were useless against armour decades ago. We’re sending flak jackets. We haven’t used them since Yugoslavia. It’s like we’re cleaning our basement and giving the Ukraine the stuff we would put in a garage sale. We are sending Carl Gustavs, which are quite effective despite the age of the original design but we are pulling them from our own military units. WTF are we going to use if/when we get called to fight? Rocks?  We’re sending handguns. Our pistols have been in use since WWII. They are old and they are worn out. We’ve been in the process of replacing them for years with no purchase in sight. It’s like Trudeau is emptying our inventory to say, sorry we can’t send troops because we can’t arm them. \n\nIf this blows up, by the time we even get our equipment there, it’ll be too late. \n\nThere is no line in the sand because the West doesn’t want to make one. Even if we had one, it would be like Obama’s which changed every time it was approached. \n\nNothing changed the fact that Russia has lots of soldiers to absorb our munitions and attack again once we run out. \n\nI don’t like what I’m saying but in WWII terms Putin has taken Poland and we’ve made a lot of promises we probably won’t fulfill. We could’ve stopped Putin 20 years ago but we said the same thing. Putin will starve his own people to death before he’d even consider stopping. We’re not on 1939 anymore. We’re in 1940. \n\nIt’s no different from the soft touch we are using on the Nazis with pin our countries today. They aren’t following the law to make their gains. But we prefer that we can deal with them like civilized people. \n\nAs a Canadian, our commitment to help the Ukraine is useless except for money which  can buy modern arms from other countries. \n\nI know I’m starting to ramble but I’m so damn frustrated.

He sadly had pretty aggressive cancer and was dying and wanted to do so where he was born so the plan was to ship his belongings to him. He’s sadly passed and we still have his belongings (all the port issues recently. Irrelevant regardless. His wife (also Hungarian) came by two days ago to go through the stuff to decide between keep & trash and while she was there myself and a coworker were just kinda chatting her up while she looked through everything and she was telling us about how everything being shown on the news isn’t accurate, that basically there was/is a lot of internal beef amongst Ukrainians between I guess certain groups/backgrounds I guess? More or less the punchline seemed to be pro Russia in her eyes and mentioned that Zelensky had been attempting to get into the Nuclear arms game via Chernobyl. \n\nNow before you rip my head off, as she is talking about these things I’m quietly thinking to myself “wow, this sounds *a lot* like what Russia is saying” in regards to their justification and i more or less wrote it off as her likely receiving news/updates from family she has in Hungary or possibly other neighbors who are spoon fed Russian propaganda. However myself simply being an ignorant American trying my very best to pretend I’m a functioning adult who knows.. stuff.. and things.. I wasn’t going to call her out or otherwise really question her on something that I admittedly don’t know shit about (aside from what’s been plastered everywhere since this started). \n\nTo be honest I never watch the news but as of the past 5ish years it’s simply just unwatchable now and while I’m not someone who runs around shouting “fake news” and scrolls Qanon all day I just simply don’t trust American media. At all. But indiscriminately. I hate them all equally. I mention all of this simply to state that it’s very difficult to know what to trust these days as everything is so goddamn narrative driven. \n\nIm just genuinely looking for some *real* feedback from someone with actual knowledge about what’s going on on the ground because as always there are two sides, both of which are claiming very different things. \n\nAnd to be clear, i personally am on the “fuck Putin” bandwagon.

You can bet your ass he's not going to be sending a ruble to rebuild their homes or get their economy back in order when this all dies down. I wish we'd also milk all the loopholes like giving Ukraine NATO jets to pilot themselves and give the remote control to Zelensky's army to pilot US drones to destroy their convoys.

(Many will say but Putin was targeting civilians already what should they do!. no. Putin was not targeting civilians directly. these were collateral damage as a result of bombing buildings he had intelligence of shoulder fired missiles or snipers in'em. but now he won't even aim)The war took longer than it should. but it went as expected. Ukraine army hid and deployed guerilla tactics as it's much smaller and weaker than Russian army (obviously) giving the Russians the field between cities. but also forcing them to fight in tight areas where their numbers won't matter. and air superiority is harder to achieve. anyone who read any war history should've seen the bombing coming. it's the logical conclusion here.",

            "text": "There are several different narratives claiming that Russia is not to blame in this conflict.\n\nOne of these is the one that Russia used, which is that they are erradicating sources of Nazi behaviour. If we were to believe that, then I see in no way whatsoever how this kind of slaughter goes towards that goal. Is the whole of Ukraine nazi? It is not logical.\n\nAnother one, to which there is at least some merit (i.e. I think it's obvious that the west is not without blame) is that **Russia is taking a kind of stand against a progressively expanding west** (similar to the cuban missile crisis, except via NATO and EU expansion). Even if there is indeed some merit to this (i.e. they were certainly vocal about not wanting Ukraine near NATO/EU and it is not too dissimilar to how vocal the US/EU would have been in a reverse situation), I do not see how just completely destroying Ukraine helps them achieve this goal of driving the west away. If they conquer Ukraine, they are closer to the west (and they have clearly escalated conflict and, thus, assured that there WILL be western weapons on their borders). If they don't conquer Ukraine and just destroy it or leave a puppet there, a similar kind of logic applies wherein by acting like ruthless murderous maniacs they have forced the west to increase their militarization.\n\nThere is a kind of third angle which is claiming that **Ukraine is a divided country and that Russia is trying to intervene in that division, bringing the parts of Ukraine that want to be in Russia to Russia**. This is equally ridiculous because I don't see how dead people can be a part of a country, since Russia is hell-bent on bombing the shit out of Ukraine.\n\n**There is no single scenario where this move makes any sense**. **Even if we look at supposed \"arguments\" that insane russia-proponents use**, this just seems like a rash move. Plus, we can't ignore the obvious amounts of misinformation (\"it's just a training exercise\", \"we're not invading\", \"there's been a terrorist attack\") and escalation before the \"pseudo-declaration of war\" (increased shelling activity, cyberattacks, etc).\n\n**No matter how badly the West may have acted in a kind of bullish attitude trying to spread their values to the borders of Russia, simply going on a rampage and murdering the people who you claim to be your brothers achieves nothing.** Russia comes out of this looking like a weak, power-mad or at least unstable country, akin to a \"much more powerful\" North Korea. If Russia was indeed attacking because of the West, then why not simply be more vocal about it? There's this insane narrative that they were, but that is false. They mentioned that the westernization of Ukraine was dangerous several times, but they just straight up started wrecking it out of apparently nowhere.\n\n**Russian people, you are not all like this, I'm aware. Unfortunately, I nevertheless cannot respect your people.** I cannot respect most russians, because somehow in that gigantic country, you have managed to let this murderous cunt rule. You have been emboldened by nationalism (oh how I fucking hate nationalism) and, even in poverty and oppression, failed to fight with the spirit that dear Ukrainians fight for their lives. **Why must the Ukrainians fight the regime you failed to fight against? Your \"brothers\" are more courageous than you.**\n\n**Fuck Putin. And, sincerely, fuck Russia.**",

After that it's going to a long, brutal guerilla war, with pockets of resistance throughout. Once that insurgency starts it's going to be TOUGH on the Ukrainians. Tough on Russia too but resistance won't really have any safe space to fall back to, very hard to get medical attention, resupplied with ammo, food, etc. It's going to be fucked depending on how much ground is completely under Russian control. Hopefully there's enough land left after the fall that Ukraine can use as their safe zone for the most part. But damn dude this sucks for the people of Ukraine, sad",
