I'm sure people noticed, some knew what was happening and some didn't and didn't care. Then, the \"reporters\" decide to make it a more interesting story and start adding claims they couldn't possibly know to be true like nobody noticed and usually add things that are flat out false like the stunt isn't humanly possible or nobody knows how it could be done in order to make the story more appealing.
