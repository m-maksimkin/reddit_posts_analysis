People were arrested for wearing Confederate buttons and for singing Confederate songs.\n\nGovernment officials shut down the Chicago Times for excessively criticizing the Lincoln administration. Editors were arrested, papers were closed, and correspondents were banned from the fields of battle. A military governor with the approval of the secretary of war, Edwin M. Stanton, destroyed the office of the Sunday Chronicle, a Washington, D.C., newspaper.\n\nDuring Lincoln‚Äôs administration, Clement L. Vallandigham, a prominent Democratic member of Congress from Ohio, was arrested for making an anti-war political speech in his home state. After his conviction by a military tribunal, Vallandigham was sentenced to prison. Lincoln, however, changed the punishment to banishment.\n\n[source](https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1425/abraham-lincoln)\n\n---\n\nFew presidents have interpreted their wartime powers as broadly as Abraham Lincoln, whose presidency‚Äîfor all of its many successes‚Äîdid have what some consider a \"dark side.\" Most famously, Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in the first year of the Civil War, responding to riots and local militia actions in the border states by allowing the indefinite detention of \"disloyal persons\" without trial. Habeas corpus, which literally means \"you have the body,\" is a constitutional mandate requiring the government to give prisoners access to the courts.\n\nLincoln ignored a Supreme Court justice's decision overturning his order, and over the next few years, the Great Emancipator, in one of the war's starkest ironies, allowed these new restrictions, which also imposed martial law in some volatile border areas and curbed freedom of speech and the press, to expand throughout the Northern states.\n\nAs the war drew to a close, though, some historians believe Lincoln may have begun to recognize the dangers of his own unprecedented expansion of presidential war powers. More than 13,000 civilians were arrested under martial law during the war throughout the Union. \n\n[source](https://www.usnews.com/news/history/articles/2009/02/10/revoking-civil-liberties-lincolns-constitutional-dilemma)\n\n---\n\nLincoln‚Äôs troops razed the South and doomed to poverty‚Äìgenerations of Southerners for many years to come. General Sherman‚Äòs ‚ÄúMarch to the Sea‚Äù was nothing more than a marauding rampage filled with robbery, rape, and murder. These men were less soldiers on a military mission and more common thugs on a crime spree. Northern armies brought war to women, children, and privately held property as a matter of official policy (rather than as so-called ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù).\n\nLincoln ordered the arrest of Baltimore police chief George P. Kane, police commissioner Charles Howard, as well as fellow commissioners: William H. Gatchell, John W. Davis, and Charles D. Hinks. Baltimore Mayor George W. Brown was arrested and sent to Fort McHenry. The men were incarcerated because they dared to publicly disagree with Lincoln and refused to carry-out the President‚Äôs tyrannical orders.\n\n1. Lincoln waged a war that cost the lives of 620,000 Americans. Including the murder of 50,000 innocent Southern civilians.\n\n2. He arrested several thousand Marylanders suspected of Southern sympathies, including 30 members of the State legislature, a US Congressman representing Maryland, the mayor and police commissioner of Baltimore, and most of the Baltimore city council. These political detainees were imprisoned in Fort McHenry and Point Lookout without trial, in many cases, for several years.\n\n3. He suspended the writ of habeas corpus without the consent of Congress (as required by the Constitution).\n\n4. He illegally shut down and confiscated the printing presses of dozens of newspapers that had spoken out against him.\n\n5. He re-instated and summarily promoted an Army officer who had been court martialed and cashiered by the US Army for war crimes.\n\n6. He even had an arrest warrant issued for the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court because said justice refused to back his illegal actions.\n\n7. Chief Justice Roger B Taney ruled that Lincolns actions were illegal, criminal and unconstitutional.\n\n8. He invaded the South without the consent of Congress as required by the Constitution.\n\n9. He blockaded Southern ports without a declaration of war, as required by the Constitution.\n\n10. He imprisoned without trial, hundreds of newspaper editors and owners and censored all newspaper and telegraph communication.\n\n11. He created two new states without the consent of the citizens of those states in order to artificially inflate the Republican Partys electoral vote.\n\n12. He ordered Federal troops to interfere with Northern elections to assure his Parties victories.\n\n13. He confiscated private property, including firearms, in violation of the Second Amendment; and effectively gutted the Tenth and Ninth Amendments as well.\n\n14. He had his Generals attack US cities full of women and children and burn them to the ground.\n\n[source](https://southernsentinel.wordpress.com/lincolnwas-a-war-criminal/)",

If what I feel were equally distributed to the whole human family, there would not be one cheerful face on the earth. Whether I shall ever be better I can not tell; I awfully forebode I shall not. To remain as I am is impossible; I must die or be better, it appears to me.\"\n\nThere are numerous articles about his constant battle with depression, but I highly recommend reading Joshua Wolk Shenk's \"Lincoln's Melancholy\" if  you're interested. His story is even more fascinating and inspiring than what is typically known, I think.",
