Your limbs are discolored and you can't feel any pain, because of damage to your nerves from hypothermia. You must be an invincible demigod. \n\nYou die an early age, your body and mind brutally damaged by the expedition, but your people will say you were enraptured by your newfound power and incurred the wrath of the Gods, screaming at the sky and beating your chest.
