This, rather than public anger will decide any change of course; and is why the sanctions are so specifically targetting individual Oligarches. It's only when they are really suffering that there's any chance those around Putin will consider it worth risking his wrath to try and rebuild ties with the West.\n\nWhilst people are foaming about harming average Russians, the sad fact is that even if you wanted to hurt them out of the idea of breaking morale, it was never going to be a popular war in the first place... and so what the public think is, at the highest political level, largely irrelevant.\n\nPeople can say \"Well, what if the lack of support in Russia leads to the army rebelling and refusing to fight...?\"  You won't see that, even in a conscript army these days, unless the army has no morale in the first place either. A well trained army obeys orders and, despit what Reddit was telling itself until today, Russia does have a highly efficient army... and police force, at least with regards to those dragging these protesters off the streets.\n\nBut when this is all over, you will need to rebuild a society in Russia that understands and nurtures the democratic principles; turning on the Russian demos *now*, whilst it may feel cathartic and a way of dealing with the sense of impotence, will only complicate and frustrate that issue because the Russian people were never your enemy.

For instance, I just saw a video link here in the comments that's from a UK protest. I'm not trying to sound rude but I don't understand the point of it. Putin doesn't care what his own people say, so what good does it do to have protests in OTHER countries? Like what good would it do if I went to our downtown in the U.S. and started chanting against this invasion? Is it merely to show the Ukrainian people our support?
