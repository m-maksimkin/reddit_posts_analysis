He knows one step too far will get him killed(I think if he calls the nuclear strikes someone will take him out) and he will try to damage Ukraine to it's hardest. There can be indiscriminate bombing in a large scale and this will have unnecessary casualties.\n\n\nNot only animals have a fight or flight response even we humans do. And if Putin gets pushed too hard in the corner he might fight back with his full force. He started the war, the conflict and the terror but for the sake of saving even one more life we need to continue talking and find a way to stop this war. Everyone is seeing red against Russia but everyone should aldo know that this war will end someday. And when the war ends there will be talking again. So let's start talking and don't stop until we find a solution.\n\n\nWe also need to start thinking how the Ukraine will look like if this war keeps going. There is a huge amount of weapons that will be there after the war and extremist groups which established themselves in this war will try to get control and power. These are the next huge challenges if Ukraine wins the war and keeping the war going will only make these challenges harder. \n\n\nAnd let's not forget Russia. The economic damage it has taken will make the country unstable. From the last few days we have seen brave Russians protesting against their leader. We have to ensure, that those people are not punished by the decision of Putin and we have to find a way to include Russia into the World again. It won't and it cannotbecomea second Nort Korea. \n\nI hope for peace and safety for everyone.",

They have big massive Steel Balls.\n\nThe president will not leave his people to suffer and die while he could turn tail and run. He's right there with them to the end.\n\nThe Mayor of Kyiv is an ex-boxer and has tooled up to fight Russians with his neighbours.\n\nThe ex-president has tooled up his neighborhood and is ready to fight and die for his people.\n\nThis guy stands in front of the world's powers and tells Putin to kill himself like a little bitch like Hitler did back in 1945.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTitanic Steel Fucking Balls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan we in the UK and US really say the same about our leaders? Would they stand up in the open while the bombs fall and tell Putin to fuck off? Or would they cower in their nuke-proof bunkers miles underground while their people get blown up defending their land?\n\nIf our leaders in the west were as bad ass as these fuckers are I think a lot less of us would be disillusioned with our respective ineffectual leaderships, because they'd actually get shit done.",
