As the solution evaporated, crystals started forming.

Can you check a bit of my math?\n\nI want a 250g crystal out of this, and I'm going to assume a 50% yield by the end, so I need to make enough solution for a 500g crystal.  It's 35% copper by weight, so I need 175g of copper. It takes 80mL of 6% H2O2 to oxidize that, and 700mL of 45% vinegar to dissolve all of that.  It will be soluble to about 20g/mL in the final solution if I hear it up to 190F, so I can use additional vinegar to bring the volume up to 800mL. When cooled, it will be super saturated.\n\nSo my shopping list is:\n\n175g of powdered copper\n\n800 mL of 45% vinegar\n\n80 mL of 6% H2O2\n\nTwo 1L beakers\n\n*****\n\nSound about right?",

I definitely wanna give this a shot, I’ve always loved rocks and minerals and loved growing crystals with those kits as a kid. \n\nI do have one question/request. For your salt crystal formation, I think it would be really neat to add a section about forming sodium chloride crystals for culinary use (for example, Maldon salt). Most guides I’ve seen online don’t even get close to the large, unique crystals that Maldon seems to achieve. From what I’ve seen, they just look like clumps of salt, and I think it’s really missing that visual allure that the store bought fancy salts gave. I’d love to know how to grow those (for culinary use) so a guide would be really awesome. I think a lot of home cooks would love something like that (or maybe I’m just super nerdy about cooking).\n\nAnyways, again for sharing and providing such detail for anyone to replicate. God bless!",
