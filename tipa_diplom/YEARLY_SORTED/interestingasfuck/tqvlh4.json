Years ago my aunt who has a farm called me and asked me if I wanted some \"Strazzberries\" which were what the online seller called the variety.  The reason why she wanted me to come out and get some is because apparently she was plowing them all under for the second year in a row as they were extremely hardy and spreading rapidly.  She stated they grow a giant beautiful Porsche Red berry with the sweetness and juiciness unlike any other.  I was like \"I'll be there\"  and subsequently harvested about 6 plants and planted them on my back fence in the crappiest shaded spot ever in an alley.  They took off and spread quite rapidly.  The next year they were the very first plants up after the harsh winter, they hadn't actually decomposed all the way and still had green on the leaves after copious snowfall (Michigan) I pulled 6 of them by hand quite mercilessly and transplanted them to a prepared 6'x6' bordered section of my sunny garden in which they proceeded to fill completely in one season.  It's been 5 years now and I have them all around my property as ground cover in a variety of poor sun and soil areas and they're fantastic hardy ground cover much superior to the weeds previously found there.  They get walked on, driven on, played in by children and grow right back thicker than ever.  The berries are a delectable large size of a sweetness and flavor which cannot be adequately described.

The inflation involved here is prohibitively obscene and is all about the consumer festish that this film wants you to think is believeable. But that's not how pleasure works. Read your Epicurus and get wise, don't waste your fucking money on overpriced bullshit. Instead, enjoy what you have deeply. That's my advice, take it or leave it.  Now, if this guy wants to gift me one, I'd eat it.  Sure, but buying it is for someone who doesn't know what to do with their money and for those lucky few who have abused and disregarded countless humans to be able to over pay for a prestige product. I'm sure the farmer knows his stuff and does good work, but he's also smart enough, competent enough and been at the game long enough to know that bilking conspicuous consumers with more money than sense is sweeter than any fruit.  So I don't blame him. But buy his product? Give me a break. I've millions of dollars that I've worked for in my life and I enjoy and afford whatever I want in this world.

But there are also stores with the same appearance [and products with similar price tags] that sell fruits. But not your everyday apples - these are Japanese luxury fruits. \n\nAcross Japan products from the field of luxury fruits regularly sell for tens of thousands of dollars. For example, a premium Hokkaido Cantaloupe sold for a record of 27240 USD [3 Mio Yen]. While there are also cheaper products like the white strawberries that are sold for around 10 USD a piece, prices beyond the 100 USD border are no rarity. \n\nThe reason for the immense love for fruits has its background in its ties with social and cultural practices. Besides being an important part of a diet, fruits are considered a luxury item in Japan. Therefore they play an important and elaborate ritual part in Japan's extensive gift-giving practices. \n\n\"People purchase these expensive fruits to demonstrate how special their gifts are to the recipients, for special occasions or for someone socially important, like your boss,\" says Soyeon Shim, who has conducted extensive academic research into Japan's luxury fruit market in an interview with CNN. The high value of fruits in Japanese culture also derives from their spiritual usage, offering them to the gods. For this reason, high-end fruits have become a symbol of special respect. \n\nThe cultivating involves year-long tested practices by Japanese farmers. From cube- or heart-shaped watermelons, over grapes, the size of a ping-pong ball to strawberries selling up to 5000 USD because of their baseball size and their finessed taste the farmers strive for perfection. \n\nThe fruits, regardless of size and shape always come carefully packaged. From jewelry-like boxes for strawberries to wooden boxes for melons, the staff makes sure the high standards of Japanese customers that are said to also \"eat with their eyes\" are met‚Äù\n\nSource is a really interesting Instagram page that posts aesthetic pictures while also going into great detail about what they are about.\n\n[sabukaru.online](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWOcnacj651/?utm_medium=copy_link)",

When the meal arrives the owner gives him a small plate of Castanhas.\n\nConfused, the tourist says:\n\n\"I didn't ask for these\"\n\n\"they're on the house\"\n\n\"you're giving something so expensive for free?\"\n\n\"expensive? we usually give these to the pigs.\"\n\nT.L.D.R.: castanhas are a luxury abroas, but here they're so cheap, they're used as pig feed (just about anyone can afford a tray-full of them)\n\nP.S.: castanhas are a type of fruit (if you look very closely there's seeds in there) very popular in Portugal that is harvested in the autumn. They come inside a spiky ball and have a brown inedible shell and the edible part is yellow on the outside and whiteish on the inside. They are often steamed, but I think they're best in the oven with pork or roasted in the oven (by the tray full) with only some salt).\n\nEdit:They're chestnuts",

They also had strawberries that were $13 for 4 and they had $22 peaches (for one). \n\nIt's like guaranteeing you get an absolutely perfect melon. Even at only (üòÖ) $16, the center of the melon was so aromatic, and almost TOO sweet. It was by far the best melon I've ever had. \n\nBut, personally I'd rather spend $16 on like, 9 melons, and take my chances on quality. You can't put a price on experience though! When in Rome!",
