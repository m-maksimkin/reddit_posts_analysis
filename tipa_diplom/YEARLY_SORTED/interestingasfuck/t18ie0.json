This list was drawn up and annotated by journalists from the¬†Kyiv Independent, so we cannot verify the exact nature of these organisations. Please take time to do your own due diligence before donating. Thank you to Karty for the suggestion.\n\n\nCharities that help the war effort\n\nSave Life: This NGO crowdfunds non-lethal military equipment, such as thermal vision scopes & supplies it to the Donbas front lines. It also provides training for Ukrainian soldiers, as well as researching troops‚Äô needs and social reintegration of veterans.\n\nDonbas SOS: This organization helps those who live in the Donbas war zone, those who relocated to other parts of Ukraine, and freed prisoners of war. It offers legal support, accommodation assistance, and psychological aid among other things.\n\nCrimea SOS: This organization has been helping internally displaced people from Crimea since Russia occupied the peninsula in 2014. It documents Russian authorities' repressions against Crimeans and advocates for the end of the occupation.\n\nHospitallers¬†: This is a medical battalion that unites volunteer paramedics and doctors to save the lives of soldiers on the frontline. They crowdfund their vehicle repairs, fuel, and medical equipment.\n\nCharities that help children\n\nTabletochki: This foundation has been supporting children with cancer for 10 years.
