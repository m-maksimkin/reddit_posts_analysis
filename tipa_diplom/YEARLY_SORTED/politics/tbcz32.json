I just want to say: I vote for democrats the vast majority of the time, so I'm kind of at a loss that I'm taking the opposing view here, but: High prices are a symptom of tight supply relative to demand. This program cuts the incentive for oil companies to produce more fuel by - let's call it - half. If we really want the producers to drill and produce more crude, this incentive may be a bad plan.\n\nThat said... if the goal is to ease the pain a little while without boosting drilling so much? Maybe there's something there. I'd like to see the math on whether this would actually do enough to help out low-income Americans.\n\nWhat I'd like to see instead, or maybe in combination: Ask corporations to have employees that can work from home to do so, thereby eliminating a fair bit of demand driven by daily commutes. Maybe it's WFH 3 days/wk and 2 days/wk in the office... we can iron out the details.

Domestically, we (had) a series of policies that encouraged domestic production of energy and energy friendly policies which resulted in low prices of oil and gas products.\n\nCovid aside, we had policies that were friendly to the blood that is necessary to operate the American body. \n\nWhen the new administration took over, they not only signaled they were actively hostile towards domestic oil and gas, but put in place policies that killed some existing and future domestic oil & gas production and the ease of movement of fossil fuel products through America. \n\nThis was taken by the oil companies and the banks that financed their capital expenditures that the \"new\" domestic energy agenda was to be wrapped up in forcing \"clean\" energy initiatives and accelerating the transition to alternative, non-fossil fuel forms of energy. \n\nThe result is that oil companies, drillers and explorers spent less on Capex among other things. \n\nNow that the Biden admin is in a political nightmare with inflation via high energy costs, they have tried to extend an olive branch to big oil. But big oil will say, either you explicitly reverse the disastrous policies that have largely contributed to this mess, or fuck you. \n\nThey made their bed for their climate agenda and they are now laying in it (unfortunately for us). \n\nThey made a gamble. Their bet was that global energy prices would remain relatively low enough and stable for their green energy policies, credits, etc to catch. They calculated horribly wrong (given that they knew that inflation and energy prices would increase post COVID hysteria) and then, they just got black swan'ed on top of it via Russia v Ukraine. \n\nThe sensible approach would have been just put an impossible to pass bill with some the things he put through executive order attached to radical stuff, take your lumps and say \"we gave it the old college try\", blame it on Manchin and not fuck up a good thing while quietly stuffing piecemeal their green energy policies slowly into other bills. Instead, they played politics to score points with their base and more radical factions of the Democrat party. \n\nI have also seen comments like, \"just fucking lower the cost of gas.\" You can't do this via back door price controls, (aka basically the idea in this article) because that may temporarily work in the very short term, but will ultimately make the situation way worse in the intermediate and long term. \n\nThis is a disaster we haven't seen in 40 years. In this scenario, the Biden energy policies can be equated to the meme of the guy on a bike putting a stick in the spokes. \n\nIf they continue to deflect, blame Putin, Covid and any other excuses they can throw at the wall and not actually concede, reverse course and address the issues of suppliers of the product they need have levied, this will only get worse. \n\nMy bet is that if he just admits that he was wrong, reverse course and actually \"do all that I can to lower gas prices\", he will see a bump in his poll numbers. Admitting your policies were wrong may be suicide in Washington, DC but for the good majority of Americans, conceding and changing course when action is needed, is viewed as leadership and we need alot of it now.",

I’m a leftist and I hate when democrats try doing stupid shit like this. Real socialist programs can be very effective and helpful - NOT taxing a huge industry while prices are already insanely high to get people enough money to buy 4 more tanks of gas. If this somehow gets passed and gas prices even slightly increase at any point afterwards? Forget it, we’ll never fucking hear the end of it. On top of that, imagine what other industries will do to take advantage of this. Would this taxation cause a price increase in gas? Let’s hope not, or the grocery stores will complain about “increased shipping costs” while artificially raising the cost of groceries well beyond what is needed to actually compensate for the increased cost. They’re already doing this now from COVID. \n\nNow, if this was done as part of a larger scale effort, like taxing oil, big tech, big pharma, etc and redistributing that wealth to the Americans below the poverty line/use it to build homes for the homeless/help fund Medicare for all, that would be a different story. But $240 a year? The right is going to have a field day with this. Classic Democrat bullshit where they act like they’re fighting for the working class when really they just want to virtue signal. Can’t believe this is the most “progressive” party in our country and their solution to rising gas prices is potentially giving people $240 a year after major taxation. \n\nThe working class in this country is in need of serious help, and this won’t do shit. We got through a pandemic and still don’t have single payer healthcare, we worked from home and made historic wealth increases and yet are still being urged by companies and the fucking POTUS to return to office, POTUS promised to cancel student debt and doesn’t even bring it up at the SOTU, the list goes on. It’s a shit show, the people in power don’t give a fuck about any of us.

I, an oil company, make an extra $5 per barrel over the old 2015-2019 figures; consumers pay $5 more per barrel for derived goods and services.  Now the government takes $2.50 as taxes, leaving only $2.50 as extra profit for me.  But wait, I'm free to set the price I sell at, so I can just charge a $10 markup!  Now I get my $5, same as before the tax.  Consumers now pay a $10 markup on goods and services derived from oil, but the government takes half of that and gives it back to them, so they only pay $5 overall.

No more subsidies, no more tax breaks, now THEY start paying.\n\n3) Institute price caps tied to actual market factors (cost per barrel, manufacturing costs, distribution, taxes) with a maximum of 5% profit margin allowed. \n\n\nEnd result? The people stop subsidizing the oil industry which saves us tax dollars. Those same companies are now PAYING their taxes rather than getting big, fat rebates every year (or owing 'zero'). AND the market price is capped so that we're not gouged to hell every time a seagull farts in Gulfport. The companies themselves will still make a modest 5% profit. And before someone says '5% isn't much' - it is when you factor in their supply. Even at 5% they'll be bringing in millions each quarter in pure profit. \n\nThere is a reason that the oil companies are posting record profits right now - coincidentally at the same time we're seeing a record for inflation. Look at the cost per barrel for oil. Its not that much higher than in the past. Lower in some cases! Yet the price of gas is MUCH higher. Why? 'Inflation' is a convenient excuse that the oil companies (and others) are using to jack their prices up. But its not going up to compensate for their own costs - its 100% going to profit! Much of the current inflation numbers (not all, but a lot) is completely due to corporate greed taking advantage of the situation. And of course the media is happily going right along with it. 'Big Inflation' makes for a great story.",

Oil is a global commodity and publicly-traded companies have little control over price.  Even giant, definitely-illegal-if-they-weren't-other-sovereign-nation price cartels like OPEC have only limited control.  \n\nThe underlying problem is that oil supply depends very much on oil price.  Some oil in the ground (especially in Saudi Arabia) can be brought to the surface very cheaply.  The more you are willing to spend, the more oil you are able to get out of the ground.  There are fields that would cost $100/barrel to produce and so won't be produced unless oil will reliably be above that amount.  Ramping down and especially up supply can take years.  When there are demand or supply shocks, the price can jump very quickly.  When that happens, oil companies will *temporarily* see an increase in profit.  They will green-light more expensive oil projects, increase supply, and slowly steady out the market.  They need the boom times to level out the bust times.  Just look at the XOM ROI:\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/XOM/exxon/roi](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/XOM/exxon/roi)\n\nIt's averages out to about 10%.  That's a good return, especially considering the size of that investment, but it's not insane.  It's also probably not a coincidence.  They are only working on project that they think will yield a 10% return over the long haul.  Having been through a number of layoff cycles, they will absolutely grow or shrink the business in response to having to hit that mark.    \n\nNow maybe you think even 10% is too much profit for a company to be making.  Look at Alphabet, for instance:  \n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOGL/alphabet/roi](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOGL/alphabet/roi)\n\nThey are doing much better.  In that case, I don't think your problem is with oil and gas specifically so much as it is with capitalism in general.\n\nNow there ARE a lot of things that can be criticized about the oil industry and especially the oil industry in the US.  I think the US gives away far too much in terms of public drilling and leases (compared with the rest of the world).  In large part that is driven by unrealistic demands to \"keep gas cheap\".  Oil companies are generally shooting for their base ROI and less of the money going to taxpayers for the use of public land helps make oil that would be unprofitable in, say, Norway, feasible in the US.\n\n[https://www.npr.org/2021/11/26/1059398764/biden-calls-for-higher-fees-for-oil-gas-leasing-on-federal-land-stops-short-of-b](https://www.npr.org/2021/11/26/1059398764/biden-calls-for-higher-fees-for-oil-gas-leasing-on-federal-land-stops-short-of-b)",

            "text": "TLDR: I don't think this will work the way they want it to, even if it were to pass.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean, I'd need to get deeper into the weeds on the legislation that a BI article, but this feels like it has the potential to hugely backfire, similar to the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nFor those not aware, after the 2008 Financial Crisis the CFTC wanted to bring in more control over the rampant speculation in the market with the creation (in 2010) of the Dodd-Frank Act (adopted and en force much later). The Coles Notes version is that in attempt to remove speculators they imposed a tiered burden-of-proof reporting system and position limits that were dependent on whether you were an end-user (small investor, or hedger), or \"market maker\" (there were different classes, I'm over-simplifying because it's a 600-page legal document).\n\nThe aim had been to remove some of the speculators in the market, thereby \"protecting\" the small mom-and-pop investments (and hedgers in the case of commodities, etc.).\n\nThe problem was the mat many of the speculators it removed were a lot of black-box trading shops (machine algorithm). These companies often (but obviously not exclusively) tended to trade on mean-reversion statistical trends which actually had the effect of pushing the market back to the middle on an average day (although admittedly if they got stopped they tended to exacerbate the Black Swan events).\n\nThe end result was that the average day in the market became significantly more volatile. Yes, there were less tail events (read: giant market-move single days), but the intraday choppiness it created was more damaging to the small guys that the speculators had been. This was particularly true in Oil, where front-month WTI went from trading an average of \\~600-800 Mbpd to more like \\~350-450 Mbpd. Basicaslly it cut out like 40% of the liquidity. This in turn was a contributing factor to the severity of the crashes in Oil price in 2013-14 and early 2020 (yes, clearly COVID caused 2020, but we never would have gone negative on the K0 expiration day if not for the reduced liquidity).\n\nAnyhow, that's long and STILL over-simplifies an incredibly complicated market. So here are my top-level thoughts on this new legislation:\n\n1. I have no problem with taxing ALL corporations more. If you want to single out Petroleum companies, that's fine. But the corporate tax rates in N.A. are problematically low across the board.\n2. The issue is that the price at the pump is only secondarily driven by the headline price of crude oil. For example, the Diesel and Gasoline cracks have nearly doubled in the past week and a half, and that has to do with the refineries.\n3. Another issue is that unless the tax rate is >=100% above a price threshold, companies are STILL INCENTIVIZED to charge more. Example: Price over $4/gallon (USG), company gets charged 50% tax (instead of 25%). At $5/USG, company presumably takes home at minimum $3.50/USG (25% of $4 + 50% of the extra $1), under old method of taking home at minimum $3.75/USG. These are at 0-cost base, deductions.\n4. This also ignores that the biggest factor in at-the-pump pricing (at least in Canada) is Gov't taxes. That's approximately 40% of the pump price where I live.\n5. The complicated one. See below.\n\nHere's the trick though, even if I'm wrong about this - this legislation would still fail. As we saw with the stimulus checks printed through the Western World (not just the US), putting cash into everyone's hands doesn't actually solve problems. Yes, many people needed that cash and used it to combat rising grocery costs, loss of income. But MANY others, including \"not wealthy\" people turned around and invested the money. Because of an entire generation's disenfranchisement with their parent's generation, and Wall Street, and the gov't these investments trended towards non-traditional investments (Crypto, Memes like GME/AMC, etc.) including directly investing in the commodities themselves via ETFs.\n\nThis is key, ETFs have allowed direct access to investing in market prices instead of need to invest in companies in those spheres (for example, investing in a Oil ETF instead of Exxon gives more direct gain to the price of oil). This rise of ETFs has caused a decoupling of the financial contracts behind those ETFs (like WTI) and the physical supply/demand balances themselves. This is one of the key drivers behind the increase in backwardation in all global crude prices (current price greater than future price) because the investment money is all coming in on the front/long side of the market and has forced the hedgers further out (or stopped them from hedging).\n\nIf this money goes straight to the hands of everyone it genuinely risks making the current problem even worse.\n\nTo solve this, the better way would be to subsidize goods and services. Unfortunately, cash in hand is (1) a better vote-gainer, and (2) better in general for the people receiving it). Hence I think this piece of legislation would go wrong, even if it's coming from the right place.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a \"don't tax rich people\" comment, it's a \"tax them smarter\" comment, and I'm Canadian, so not necessarily fully in the loop. I do, however, know a LOT about these markets, seeing as it is my job to.\n\nSOURCE: It's my job to look at this stuff.\n\nApologies for the length - if you made it through well done.",
