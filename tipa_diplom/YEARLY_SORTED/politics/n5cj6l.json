Not to punish those states, but to more comparatively set taxes.\n\nLET‚ÄôS TALK ABOUT THE .01% please! \n[link to comparative picture](https://twitter.com/harold90179988/status/1389971392028872707?s=21)\n\n[read this article about the .01% the real issue and don‚Äôt let them punish the actual working rich. #go after old money!! ](https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/never-mind-1-percent-lets-talk-about-001-percent)\n\nSince the 1970s, average incomes have grown, but the growth has not been uniform across the income distribution. The incomes at the top, especially in the top 1 percent, have grown much faster than average,‚Äù wrote Harvard‚Äôs N. Gregory Mankiw, in a 2013 paper entitled ‚ÄúDefending the One Percent.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese high earners have made significant economic contributions, but they have also reaped large gains. The question for public policy is what, if anything, to do about it. This development is one of the largest challenges facing the body politic.‚Äù\n\nMankiw noted that the 1 percent‚Äôs share of total income, excluding capital gains, rose from about 8 percent in 1973 to 17 percent in 2010, the latest figures available at the time. ‚ÄúEven more striking is the share earned by the top 0.01 percent. . . . This group‚Äôs share of total income rose from 0.5 percent in 1973 to 3.3 percent in 2010. These numbers are not easily ignored. Indeed, they in no small part motivated the Occupy movement, and they have led to calls from policymakers on the left to make the tax code more progressive.‚Äù\n\nIn the nearly five years since Mankiw‚Äôs paper, economists have assembled more data with which to analyze the 0.01 percent. In the 35 years ending in 2015, the share of total income has accrued faster to the 0.01 percent than it has to the rest of the 1 percent. The share of total income has risen, according to 2015 data, to 5 percent for the 0.01 percent and 22 percent for the 1 percent. The 0.01 percent‚Äôs share of total US wealth quadrupled in the 35 years ending in 2012 to 11 percent, argue University of California at Berkeley‚Äôs Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who have made wealth calculations through 2012.\n\nThe United States has 325 million people‚Äîin 160 million households, as viewed by the Internal Revenue Service. That means 1.6 million households fall into the 1 percent category.\n\nThe threshold for membership in the 1 percent in 2014 was an annual household income of $386,000, excluding any capital gains, according to Chicago Booth‚Äôs Eric Zwick. That‚Äôs more than seven times the median household income that year of $54,000. The 0.1 percent, 160,000 families, in 2014 made at least $1.5 million a year. The top 0.01 percent, 16,000 families, had annual income of $7 million.  \n\nThe 0.01 percent also perform best in comparisons of wealth. Saez and Zucman, in an influential 2014 study, used income data from the IRS to ‚Äúcapitalize,‚Äù or derive, wealth based on the expected aggregate rate of return from every asset class or source of income reported on tax returns. They say the share of total wealth of the top 1 percent has increased steadily, from below 25 percent in 1978 to 42 percent in 2012. The share of total wealth of the top 0.1 percent has roughly tripled, and the share of the 0.01 percent has more than quintupled. The top 0.01 percent of US households had at least $111 million in net worth in 2012, compared to $4 million for the 1 percent.",

I am by no means rich and I have accountants that use the code to write off all kinds of things because it's legal and just like every politician and every other \"ultra-rich\", they are doing what the democrats and republicans currently in office have written for them to use....LEGALLY.\n\nBOTH PARTIES changed the tax codes after Reagan left office to give themselves and their financier buddies all the write offs and loopholes we have today. You may hate Reagan, but one thing he did do was trim the tax codes and actually made the rich pay their fair share. We saw a drop in tax rates BUT we also had a jump in tax revenues because rich people couldn't write off all the bullshit they were doing..and are doing once again.\n\nAuditing the \"super rich\" isn't the issue. You have to tell those you support as your political leaders to audit themselves and quit buying into their bullshit lies.",

Richer people pay more than their fair share because they don't get extra govt representation than those who pay a lower %.   \n\nThe government doesn't need all this damn money. These people are so damn corrupt, give themselves raises every few years, lie to and cheat us constantly, and every now and then offer us a few crumbs of the pie, as a gift used to give us some hope and keep us dependent on them. They use things like race and sex, sexual orientation, gender identity whatever it is to pit us against eachother and victimize us in different ways to get us to depend on their salvation from the chaos and threat of identity wars that THEY helped fuel. This is all just so they can remain in power financially, culturally and politically.   \n\nThis right here might be presented as just a legal matter but it's not, it's political. They'll do this so they can find out how much companies like Amazon pay in taxes vs. R&D and use that to pit us against them as if they're thieves because they deduct half their taxes on account of research and development. Even though that's a good thing, as it's used to employ many people to invent new products and services, whom they give healthcare to, and pay fairly, and create much cheaper products that we can all use while they do it.   \n\nThey'd rather have the government take that money instead (who doesn't pay taxes and is the biggest corporation of all), which will end up slowing that process down and making prices go up. They'll want the govt to provide those things instead with that money even though the govt. is terrible at that and it will just allow anyone they pay to just hike up the prices like colleges. Just like insurance companies. Why not charge $1M for an education if the govt will just pay for it? Unless the govt just sets the price, which will be really fun times if the government has the power to just set whatever prices it wants for stuff.

Tax breaks so the ultra wealthy, who already hold 90% of the country's wealth, can make even more? That's just greed.

Whether you like Bernie and AOC or not, I believe that this shift has slowly happened because they have been applying constant pressure to combat the propaganda of the ultra-wealthy. This brings me hope for the future. But reining in the ultra-wealthy alone won't be enough. We need to change the culture entirely. We need to replace the worship of greed with the worship of productivity and material contribution. We need to do away with jobs that shouldn't exist. This means jobs that only exist because the cost of labor has been so low, and jobs that shouldn't exist because they capture value that they didn't generate. e.g. stockbrokers, scalpers, insane realtor commissions, all sorts of buying low and sell high schemes, advertising and the markets for overpriced poor quality goods they create, landlords, and any form of rentier class economic vehicles.",

The IRS scrutinized these applications and the DOP Tea Partyers got angry and cut the IRS funding. \n\n>Between 2010 and 2012, the number of applications the IRS received each year seeking 501(c)(4) certification doubled.[35] During this period, budget cuts and personnel cuts reduced the IRS's ability to adequately perform its core duties.[36] When the Obama administration requested in 2011 that Congress increase the IRS's $12.1 billion budget by $1 billion to allow the agency to hire 5,100 additional agents, Congress instead reduced the IRS budget to $11.8 billion, and the IRS offered buyouts to 5,400 of its 95,000 employees.[36] The U.S. National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina E. Olson, told The New York Times in January 2012, \"The overriding challenge facing the I.R.S. is that its workload has grown significantly in recent years, while its funding is being cut.... This is causing the I.R.S. to resort to shortcuts that undermine fundamental taxpayer rights and harm taxpayers‚Äîand at the same time reduces the I.R.S.'s ability to deliver on its core mission of raising revenue.\"[36]\n\nThe IRS had their budget cut and had to review many more applications than normal in '10 to '12. This lead to the IRS using various search functions that were intended to do more with less. These search functions were perceived to target right wing groups and thus an adversarial relationship between the right wing and the IRS was created. The current IRS budget is still at about 11 billion, even less than it was in 2011. Total taxes brought in to the US are about 3.5 trillion. This would be effectively the same as your company (contracting for example) reviewing a bill for 3,500 USD but only paying the guy to review it 11 dollars. I have been involved with proposals for 10k to 100k USD as part of my job (consulting engineering services) and each of those contracts are reviewed by someone who's bill rate was north of 200 USD for at least a half an hour.
