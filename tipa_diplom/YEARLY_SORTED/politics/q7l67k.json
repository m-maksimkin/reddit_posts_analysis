It is the single most important thing for Republicans to do.\n\n\nHe's talking about solving \"fraud,\" and implying that Republicans votes won't be counted AKA fraud will make it so Republicans effectively don't vote.\n\nHe's not telling Republicans to avoid voting. He's trying to scare them into \"solving\" a fake problem, which keeps them engaged, so that they **do** vote.",

Not entirely sure as his Twitter description doesn’t go into detail) who also doesn’t have any additional details regarding the info other than quotations. It’s easy to take these headlines as fact, but as a regular citizen am I just supposed to believe this person at face value? Granted I haven’t looked too deeply into the sources behind this, but as an average person I shouldn’t really have to.\n\nEdit: I located the source via reading the comments on this thread, which comes from [Trump’s website](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/news-vh9rfuemhp0). Nevertheless, I shouldn’t have to find the source myself. That should be the journalists responsibility when making such claims. Being downvoted when asking for references to a source is pretty humorous, even r/conservative -esq. I guess that’s why r/politics is known as the liberal version of it.",

They took 20% of every dollar you earned, then they shipped your brother off to die in Afghanistan.\n>\n>Then some guy from Queens moves in next door. He laughs at those private school kids. He pushes them around until they give back some of your money. They call him a bigot too, but he doesn’t seem to care. He promises you another of your siblings will never come home in a box.\n>\n>It might bother you when he uses vulgarity and invectives, but that’s easy to overlook because for the first time, someone is standing-up to those private school kids, calling-out their foolishness and self-righteousness. He might be a bully, but he’s on your team. That doesn’t mean you approve of bully tactics to get your way, or want to be a bully yourself, but it does mean you accept that nobody should think it’s okay to bully an entire worldview and way of life out of existence unless they’re prepared for the possibility to face a bully themselves one day. In other words, “if you don’t want none, don’t start none.”\n>\n>The thing is, despite whatever those private school kids and their teachers say about you, and whatever they write about you in the school paper, you are more than happy to tolerate and respect their values, so long as they extend you the same courtesy. You don’t want to legislate their jobs out of existence, tax them until they’re as poor as you are, fill their schools with your teachers, or make them pay for a new roof for your church.\n>\n>You believe diversity means more than skin tone, gender, and sexual identity. You believe a diverse society is one where different ideas are allowed and even encouraged to co-exist. They might squabble once and a while, and that’s okay, because that’s how consensus is reached between parties with different goals.\n>\n>But these private school kids, they don’t like that idea. They won’t leave you alone until you embrace their ideas, adopt their lifestyle, and share their vision for the future—a future that has no room for the person you are or the community to which you belong.\n>\n>So yeah, you’re glad this guy from Queens showed up. He’s not perfect—far from it—but he’s willing to take the punches and it’s really hard to knock him down.\n>\n>You might say, “but this Queens guy...he’s also a private school kid!” That’s true, but they never accepted him either, repulsed by his love of Big Macs and resentful that he only got accepted because his dad had cash. But that’s precisely why he gets your situation. He might have money, but he knows what it’s like to be sneered and heckled by the Lacrosse Team.\n\n~some Republican snowflake",

It worked and even though \"Yes\" won out, no one really wanted to move ahead with it because staking your career on a politically-questionable hot potato was an iffy proposition. \n\nThe vote was repeated in 2017 (97% yes, but boycotted by the anti-Statehood party) and in 2020 (whete Statehood also won). Likely no move will be made on it.\n\nThis is the exact same thing. Drive down voter turnout and, when the Dems win, say that the elections were unrepresentative and therefore the result was illegitimate. Double points if they say it means it was stolen. Triple points if it gives Dems overwhelming wins and they start making comparisons between election results in 2022 and in the Soviet Union (cuz dems r commonists).",

Thinking back to Hillary and how trump became the president. It seems like the strategy at the time was to destabilize the US through the Democrats, but instead of there being a massive shift to the conservative side, democrats (especially progressives) just stayed home and still held on to their core beliefs despite not being very active during the 2016 election. I mean think about it? I was furious that Bernie lost, but I would have never voted for trump even if my life depended on it.\nEven worse, what if some Republican politicians are in on it? Trump couldn't have done this on his own especially after being impeached TWICE. There should have been at least one republican senator ensuring the mission wasn't derailed by anything. Not stormy daniels, not the quid pro quo, not all the meetings be had with Russia that were not recorded, not the times he threw our intelligence community under the bus, not the times he tried to bully the SC, not the inserruction, not the indiscriminate firings, nothing. Trump could have murdered someone with his bare hands and he would have stayed president until the end of his term. \n\nI'm sure they knew early on that trump wouldn't get reelected, so their strategy must have changed to focus on trumpism and amplifying the radicalism of trump supporters who they've clearly established are gullible and devoid of common sense. I mean? Who politicizes vaccines?! So, my big question now is what's the endgame?! They know trump will never get reelected again, unless the republicans go full trumpism and start chipping away at democracy from the local and state levels. Hence the voting laws and all that because they've realized that democrats are essentially powerless without their votes. It's not like democratic politicians care so much about making sure trump and his cronies are persecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nIf we all know that trump can never be democratically elected again, why is he still doing what he's doing?!",

First, the 2020 election was rigged and not valid despite all the audits. This is the biggest and most substantial claim. This is factually wrong and the Arizona audit makes this abundantly clear. The second claim is this rigging will result in no republicans electives. The issue though is folks are being told not to vote.\n\nReality is, despite all the other things working against the Republican Party, they are actively encouraging people not to vote. This is making their nonsense a reality. I hope midterms work in the favor of democrats but if it does it just fuels the nonsense of the rights. If the Republican Party simply doesn’t vote that means they lose the election which further validates the notion “republicans will never win again.” \n\nTrump being an open friend to the Clinton’s it is clear he is playing a long game to help Dems. /s to the last part.
