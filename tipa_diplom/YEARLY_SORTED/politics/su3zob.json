In my state, state representatives are paid under $20,000 for that work.  Tack on a prohibition against buying stocks with your personal savings and it is a job you can only take if you are wealthy enough to afford hurting your personal finances. \n\nMeanwhile, what are we trying to prevent with this?  A state representative would have a hard time making a dent in the fortunes of a sufficiently large company.  If there is any actual potential for conflicts of interests, it would be with smaller local firms.  Banning state lawmakers from trading stocks of small, local businesses makes some sense, but banning them from trading the S&P 500 firms really does not. \n\nIf we want sound, thoughtful policy instead of a puritanical soundbite, any ban on stock trading for state and local officials should exclude index funds and large companies, at least the companies in the S&P 500 and similar global large-cap indices.",

Warren is fighting for this, Trump, Cheney, Bush...(Haliburton, Black Water, Exxon...)  the rest of the right-wing scum profit brilliantly off this, but then Pelosi, Boxer, etc. are just as bad or worse...They have, if not the deepest, the same ties to corporate scum and fraud as any Republican.

I firmly believe that the American people can change from the ground up.  Without violence, perhaps maybe some boycott power.  Gen x’ers and millennials need to step into the arena and not fall prey to special interests groups and fundraising by lobbies. The “boomers” failed us. If you claim to be conservative, demand your conservative leaders cut spending. Balance the budget, rather than just keep racking up debt. The overplay is trying to run your govt like a business. It is not.   The left needs to put down some of their special interests and focus on reduction of govt spending to justify all the pet projects and theoretical social justice/ promotion that they hide behind.  Both parties are failing and there is no moderate so the new adults in the room need to step in and moderate, perhaps even take the lead.  It’s nice to see people getting into politics, regardless of how much or little money they generate,  we need to get fresh faces in there and get the old ranks off the treadmills in the congressional and legislative gyms and send them packing.
