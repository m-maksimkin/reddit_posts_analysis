The free lunch program was supposed to help both lower and middle income families that were being squeezed due to the economic fallout of lockdown measures, and other pandemic-related issues.\nAs the economy and jobs continue recovery,  many pandemic-era help programs have been scaled back or eliminated, such as unemployment benefits, small business loans, etc.  As one would expect them to be, because they were only instituted as temporary measures. \n\nNow, I happen to agree that this is a good program, and should be permanently enshrined.  So why dont the Democrats do that, instead of relying on indefinite extension of a temporary benefit?  Oh that would require them to do something or accomplish something politically? Of course, thats not what they're paid to do, they are paid to fail while pretending to try.",

It would be double-dipping for schools also to provide an additional meal at more tax payer dollars.\n\nIf the parents/guardians of these kids are using their stipends for other means, and not to feed their kids when they go to school, then they should be charged with fraud and those kids removed from the household. Plain and simple.\n\nWhich means, yes, America needs better orphanages, better foster care programs, and more incentives for affluent people to adopt.

The federal government gave us the option of doing the SSO, which has a higher reimbursement rate per meal, similar to SFSP, where NSLP is a lower reimbursement rate,” Adams explained. “Obviously, that was an easy choice – all students would be free, plus we would get a higher reimbursement rate.\"\n\nSo its easier to provide meals AND schools get more money per meal. Now they have to go through the proper channels (which is more work) and get less money per meal. That was always supposed to be a COVID relief package that ended at some point. It was never intended to last forever. \n\nI can't find anywhere that children who previously got free lunches would no longer get free lunches. \n\nCan someone else find that?",

I cannot help but think about how many of their parents decide every six years to vote against their own best interests and reelect this husk of a person. I know, that like a hydra, cutting off the head only causes more to grow in its place and there are plenty of McConnells waiting in the wings. I also realize that his constituency is not the people who elect him, but the entities whose dollars help buy elections with their campaign funding and more insidious tactics that shape the social/political narrative. \n\nI went off the rails a bit there, but I haven’t lost sight of the forest for the trees. It took a pandemic to get some basic services in place for people who need them, greatly benefit from them, and should have had them all along. They should have had them all along. That’s the thing. That should be the focus. Flipping this dialog on its head and forcing it to be about basic human decency and not a couple percent of a percent of a percent of gov’t spending, and being willing to die on that hill, is the only way. “Whoa, you sound like a capital ‘s’ Socialist and that’s not what America’s about.” Well, yeah, I am; and well, yeah, that absolutely is what America is about.
