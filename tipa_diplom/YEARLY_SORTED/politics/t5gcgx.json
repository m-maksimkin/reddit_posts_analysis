Sure, I can see why it would be important to examine his behavior and his words directly leading up to the storming of the capitol, but this was never about one speech. \n\nDid Jim Jones inspire his followers to drink the cyanide laced kool-aid merely after one single speech? Or was it something more comprehensive? \n\nTrump cultivated the following of fanatics and glorifiers, the lies and conspiracies, the circumstances, and the justifications that altogether contributed to the events of January 6th. \n\nHe lit a flame under millions of mindless chauvinists, bigots, culture war militants, right wing reactionaries and deranged, antipathetic counter-revolutionaries, he enabled and empowered the animosity, the antagonism, the hate, hostility, contempt, vitriol and victimhood. He inflamed the culture war, encouraged the fringe conspiratorialists and propagandists, he bred the fanaticism. \n\nThen he lied, over and over again, in the face of defeat and humiliation, his biggest fears, he conjured up lies of a stolen election, convincing himself and his supporters of a reality where he was cheated, where *they* were cheated. *That justice had to be taken into their hands,* that there was no other recourse. \n\nBecause of Trump's narcissism, his vainglorious self centeredness, his obsession with his image, his sense of entitlement and his deep seated insecurities he's become utterly incapable of acknowledging a reality where he isn't the winner. Life is a zero sum game for Trump, and in his mind, he is always the winner, no matter what. This is not the first time Trump has claimed an election was \"rigged\", and it won't be the last either.\n\nIn persuading not just himself, but his supporters that the election was stolen from *them*, and continuously spreading misinformation, propaganda and conspiracies through deranged rants on social media, at masturbatory rallies, press conferences and through bizarre appearances on fringe broadcasts, while then going so far as to facilitate the event itself, he fomented what would lead to an attack on our democracy and incited a movement that continues to threaten that democracy on all fronts. And make no mistake, he's more than happy to have contributed to the enduring crusade and unrest, while both Trump and Republicans nation-wide continue to capitalize off of it.",

If there are corrections needed or clarification, please upvote anyone under this and I will try to edit. Just know this is in good faith. For now, I‚Äôm tired after ready 61 pages of legal text. \n\nIn summary: Eastman claims privilege. The only document identifying the client of Trump Org wasn‚Äôt signed. If it was, he still broke privilege by volunteering the information to a third party. He broke the privilege because legal advice is covered not political and political strategy. He broke privilege by sending info on a company email and the company policy also states that the email servers are subject to privacy. Chapman is in a small minority of university to have such bare bones email policy without user privacy. Eastman was even notified about and warned of the policy, in the form of an automated splash screen relating the policy to him upon use. And they have additional policy against use of the server for advocating a political candidate. His rebuttal to the court was that it applied to students not professors. Chapman‚Äôs President addressed him a month before use that it is crystal clear that it applied to faculty and staff. Trump then broke potential privilege by authorizing the disclosure of info to several third parties. Eastman discussed the legal memo, trump authorization, and one of the third parties on a Podcast. On May 5, 2021, Plaintiff appeared on the Peter Boyles Show and stated that ‚ÄúI would normally not talk about a private conversation I have with a client, but I have express authorization from my client, the President of the United States at the time, to describe what occurred‚Äîto truthfully describe what occurred in that conversation.‚Äù He then broke it by emailing the info to a journalist with adverse priorities to the supposed protected client. The evidence shows at minimum, Trump violated the U.S. section on obstruction of official proceedings, and The Select Committee also has a good-faith basis for concluding that the President and members of his Campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States. It then mentions his call with the swing states to decertify their results. \n\nConclusion: The release of this document and supporting evidence was only done to obtain the ADDITIONAL evidence that is being withheld by Eastman on privilege, and freeing up Chapman University to comply with the house subpoena for more evidence. Oh and also, Eastman literally ask to commit a minor legal violation when trying to pressure former VP Pence.",

I even almost voted for Trump the first time around however I started seeing the circus unfold about 5 months before the election and went with Hillary. The Republican Party has turned into one big alternate universe where real facts and data doesn't exist. They're hypocritical, self entitled and selfish programmed robots who can no longer think for themselves all the while calling everyone else sheep. Although I'm not fond of CNN, Fox and a couple others because they are biased there are some like NBC, CBS, our CDC, American Medical Board, Board of Pediatrics, and many others who have been trusted sources for information for decades. That doesn't change because they report things Republicans don't like to hear. That doesn't change because of the copious amount of BS Trump gives them to report. It definitely doesn't change because it's easier to call something a hoax than it is to call their beloved orange God imperfect. Do they get it right every single time? Of course not, they are human and especially when dealing with a virus we've never seen before. But they remain unbiased and many of them, like our medical agencies, don't even have a horse in the damn race because politics don't control them! Let alone the fact if these same exact sources say something that supports Trumplikkkans then we can MAGICALLY trust them again lol They're pro-life unless it involves something that requires them to  physically do something to save lives, other than pointing their finger and telling someone else what they should be doing. That's pro-politics, not pro-life. They believe in law and order unless it involves their party then it's a \"witch-hunt\". They believe the Republicans and Conservatives on THE SAME TICKETS won fair and square ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Every damn time a Democrat is in office they start saying \"anti-christ\" and start preaching the \"end times\". Yep they've done it to every single one, this is nothing new! They conveniently forget our country started falling apart during Trumps last 18 months lol We are where we're at because we had the worst financial crash in history under Trump. We lost the most farms and small businesses under Trump. We also had the worse unemployment rate in a century under him. Yes it takes time to dig us out of that mess!

Gerrymandering the hell out of districts that make it almost impossible for anyone else that‚Äôs not a Republican to win.  This will put us under an authoritarian type of government.  Capitalism and democracy can only work if democracy comes first or it will quickly become despotism which is absolute control.  Since huge corporations have effectively ran our government for decades now, who do you think will have the control?  First comes democracy, our freedom and freedom of religion will be next.  If the military falls in line with this new regime, it‚Äôs over.  We can‚Äôt fight aircraft, that‚Äôs impossible.  The only way to fight aircraft is to keep them on the ground where they are useless and good luck doing that.  That would take a small army who are disciplined enough to do it right.  We could take our country back but it would make the civil war look like a small skirmish and as a vet I don‚Äôt know if the loss of life would even be worth it anymore.
