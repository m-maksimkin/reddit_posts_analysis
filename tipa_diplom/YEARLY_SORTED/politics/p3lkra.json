Further investigation revealed that each of the four had also been following a daily routine of outdoor walking and shuffleboard in the afternoon three times a week,.\n\nThe nation's top scientists and leading medical authorities tell us this is most likely when their skin was most exposed to the direct sunlight, making them most vulnerable to contracting sunspots.\n\nDoctors are warning people that exposure to direct sunlight more than three hours a day at the rate of three times a week, MAY lead to contracting sunspots!\n\nThe death rate for elderly over 85 and living in Florida, has increased at an alarming rate during 2020!\n\nDoctors are advising the elderly not to move to Florida or Arizona where they would be at increased risk of contracting sunspots.\n\nMany doctors are advising the elderly take additional precautions and stay indoors to reduce their exposure to direct sunlight.\n\nFurthermore, scientists are still determining how dentures may be a contributing factor in the rising death toll among the elderly population over 85.\n\nScientists still aren't sure if the dentures found in the mouths of the victims were purchased and installed in Florida, or if the victims acquired the dentures in some other state prior to relocating to Florida.\n\nTherefore, government officials are issuing mandates across the country which would require communities to keep their elderly indoors to prevent any further risk of contracting sunspots. Mandates also include mandatory use of sunscreen by anyone being seen outdoors in public.\n\nEveryone is expected to apply sunscreen with minimum SPF-50. While applying sunscreen does not guarantee you will not contract sunspots, this statement being consistent with warning labels on all packaging of sunscreen, scientists and politicians agree it does offer each of us a sense of hope and security that we all are participating in helping our elderly follow our example of being good citizens and supporting the enforcement of our government mandates.\n\nDoctors, scientists, politicians and government officials all agree anyone expressing their own views on the death of the elderly, sunspots, sunscreen, dentures medical conclusions and findings, or government mandates that is inconsistent with theirs is simply unpatriotic and harmful to the public.\n\nThe nation's top doctors and leading scientists have determined and issue the following warning:\n\n\"For our elderly citizens, especially over 85 years of age, living in Florida, with more than 10 hours a week of exposure to direct sunlight MAY lead to contracting sunspots. Furthermore, elderly citizens of Florida over 85nyears of age, having undergone any dental procedure in the past 10 years, especially to acquire dentures, May also be at some level of increase risk of dying before reaching 100 years of age.\n\nTherefore, having either exposure to direct sunlight or any dental procedure, or having neither, everyone is susceptible and will someday succumb to death. The ederly over 85 are more susceptible. The elderly living in Florida are most at risk, especially on Thursdays!\"\n\nPresident Biden is expected to make an announcement today introducing a new vaccine which is hopeful in preventing the harmful effects of the sun. The vaccine reportedly will keep the country in the dark for as long as possible, protecting us from shining any light on controversial subjects such as the election results or anything related to any type of virus and the origin of any virus.\n\nEarly trials of the vaccine has produced promising results. Reports are coming out indicating that those vaccinated were kept in the dark from questioning anything presented as fact by government officials.\n\nNancy Pelosi says: \"This offers a promising future for American politics and our ability to govern not only our own country, bit now we have the possibility of helping bring the world together under one, unquestionable, government rule trusted by a global community.\" Pelosi says she is volunteering to be among the first to get the vaccine.\n\nPresident Biden is expected to make an announcement today signing a new Executive Order issuing a nationwide mandate and publicly calling for the removal of Florida Governor Ron Desantis.\n\nBiden has been calling for the removal of Desantis for his blatant disregard for public safety and his refusal to stop the sun from shining in Florida.\n\nIt is believed that Desantis is seeking some form of political favor, or possibly an endorsement fromformer President, Donald Trump. who resides in Florida.\n\nIt is believed Trump has requested Desantis to continue providing sunlight to Trump's Mira Lagos estate located in Florida where Desantis is the Governor.\n\nWhile both Trump and Desantis have refused to comment on this story, Pelosi is calling for a special session of Congress is preparing to approve funding to send Faichi and leading medical experts and scientists from the CDC to the sun to determine ways to stop the sun from shining.\n\nBe sure to follow us for the latest updates on this breaking news story.",

Having your teacher out for two weeks is going to impact your learning for the year, but it's pretty clear that they don't care and instead want the free babysitting schools provide. Plus it's not like teachers go home and shut down for the night, if they catch covid they can spread it to their entire household.",

Then, because the pitcher is on the enemy team, you say \"nah, that's how you swing if you wanna get a home run\" instead of \"hey sorry.\" As a result, you and your team continue to wildly swing and eventually start having players get flagged and your team received game losses and penalties. And then you say \"idk why they can't take a hit with my bat, it's how you win games.\" Your team cheers and the enemy teams just stare at you like you're a fucking idiot. And then, you realize it's actually bad, so you tell everyone \"yo, keep swinging like this\" but you stop doing the stupid swing because you don't want the penalty and just let your teammates continue to believe you and get your team penalty after penalty. \n\nWe know republican leaders got vaccinated. The lady who shoots a sign that says \"socialism\" says \"you're infringing on my rights\" when asked if she's vaccinated.

And why would anyone think that making a political statement about their freedoms are going to be more important in a children's hospital when so many of our patients are vulnerable.  They don't need to catch covid to die. But if they do, chances are bad.  So this someone thinks that their own rights are greater than keeping our children safe? Lets not forget she has a child in all this.  Poor thing. This is my frustration.  The idea of personal rights make little sense when we allow children to die.  I also don't want my 70 something parents to die either. But right now, I see way too many kids who could die tomorrow or next week because some maskless wankbanger decided that twitter doc, who has a degree in nothing, knew better than our scientists, and they thought best.\n\nb",

They call it quitters flu when I looked it up. I was working 7-12 hour shifts and a very physically demanding job. After ten days I thought withdrawals shouldn‚Äôt last this damn long so I went to the hospital to get checked out. They said you have the Rona.  I said ok what are you going to prescribe me since the nurse said they have all these medications to deal with it.  Dr said Tylenol or ibuprofen. Go home you‚Äôll be fine. Two days later I felt better and was fine. The actual flu I haven‚Äôt had for years was worse for me than Covid. Most of my friends and family have had it and symptoms varied but they where fine.  None of them but my mom had co-morbidities.  She‚Äôs 61, 350lbs and has asthma.  She wasn‚Äôt given any treatment and was fine.  A close relative we know had taken a vaccine several years ago for something else and it hospitalized them and then they died in the hospital due to the vaccine.  I‚Äôm Not against vaccines but I am for people to have the choice. I‚Äôm not sure why the reports from all the deaths and injuries from taking these vaccines are not so prevalent in the news.  I think your all adults and can make the decision for yourselves.\nOne of my actual dr.s and nurses I listen too have been banned for warning of the side effects or giving legitimate data that may give you pause before taking it.  I‚Äôm not sure why some Drs are allowed to speak on national television and then others social media are taken down if they have concern.  I listened to a dr and read some of the data on this virus and the vaccine and made a decision for myself.  Also the Dr that treated me told me you‚Äôll be fine.  He didn‚Äôt seemed worried or bothered at all with the diagnosis of covid. It was like talking to a mechanic who says just needs new spark plugs bud.  So if your worries do what makes you feel comfortable, all I can say is knowledge by reading and looking at data just like we do for stocks will make the pictured more clear and then make your decision.

Obviously I wish they hadn't died, but they made their choice just like anyone who smokes or abuses alcohol. No one writes articles about all the people dying early deaths from smoking and alcohol while governors refuse to reinstitute prohibition. Why is this headline insinuating that it's DeSantis' fault, despite the fact that he's been extremely pro vaccine?  \n\n\nThe fact is either you're vaccinated and covid (yes even delta) is basically a cold, you're unvaccinated because you chose to forego a free medical miracle in which case you made your choice, or you're a statistical outlier who has underlying medical conditions preventing you from getting the vaccine. In the last case a mask is probably not enough to protect you and you should be wearing an n-95 and/or working in a profession that does not interact with the public.",
