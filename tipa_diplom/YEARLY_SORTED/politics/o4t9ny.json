Lol, good luck! Doesn't fall under medical insurance, and half the time dental doesn't cover it. Even if it does, it's often 50% coinsurance and it's *expensive* so you're out $500+ per wisdom tooth (more if you've had any work during the year since you'd go way over the annual maximum). As a direct example, I had to get one wisdom tooth out when I was still on my dad's plan. He had the best his work offered because I've always had issues with my teeth. Even with insurance, it was over $750 for a single wisdom tooth that was already through the gum.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the silver, I'll see if my dentist can use it in my next filling to save a little money.",

My dentist has sent me for second opinion even, and they determined it's a genetically super thin amount of enamel on my\nTeeth, and the medications which cause dry mouth as well as the fractured and micro fractures in my teeth made for the perfect storm. \n\nI've been OCD about my dental care for years including before my accident. And it's mentally torture for me to do my oral care and find new cavities... I've had teeth crumble while trying to eat. \n\nI've been on high dose Vit D since my accident as well as regularly have magnesium and potassium infusions. \n\nI have done everything in my power to maintain the little health I have, and it's a constant battle with prior authorizations and denials and appeals. To end up toothless... I've paid cash for a bridge ($3500 with root canal and extraction, buildup and bridge) and 2 crowns ($2400 for the work) and Medicaid won't pay to fill minor cavities. They offer limited services even when there is a traumatic injury cause. \n\nUntil PRIVATE insurance companies are not in the marketplace for Medicaid or Medicare and its supplements- this shit isn't gonna be any better. \n\nHealthcare in the US is laughable. That's my\nOpinion as not only an unfortunate burden to the medical system myself, but also as a nurse. \n\nWhen the insurance companies override physicians it's a problem. Let's not mention the extras- ophthalmology and dentistry. That blown out eye socket proved the eye care is shit as well. \n\nOne accident has completely handicapped my ability to survive as an adult, much less be able to provide form my 2 children.\n\nMore government agencies like SS/disability are inherently flawed.

No more employer headache about health coverage  \n- it makes YOU more mobile! Don‚Äôt worry about how you‚Äôll be covered for healthcare between jobs again‚Ä¶ not just the ‚Äúlazy fucks‚Äù, but this is an issue for career driven people as well!  \n- these programs actually big-time subsidize poor red states at the expense of rich states. West Virginia, South Dakota, etc would benefit disproportionately compared to what they‚Äôre paying in, which maybe a random citizen doesn‚Äôt care but it‚Äôs a big reason for such Senators to vote for it.  \n  \nI will say though, big time against any provision to outlaw overlapping coverage. Maybe I‚Äôm paranoid, but I don‚Äôt want the government 100% dictating what doctors and nurses are paid (etc) or what treatments/meds are allowed for what.
