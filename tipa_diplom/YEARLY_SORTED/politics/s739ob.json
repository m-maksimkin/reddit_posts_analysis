But one source of unexpected opposition still isn't nearly as bad as hundreds of sources of totally expected opposition, which she should be getting lumped in with here.

However, today with industry being outsourced with globalization, workers and people have even less power in the United States. To make matters worse, cooperations, and other nations, particularly Russia but China too, can spread misinformation on social media that just polarizes society even more. High school education has been so watered down, and if u want a higher education that will actually give you insight into our system; be prepared to dish out thousands of dollars in debt, for which you will never be able to make a profitable return on, although universities and cooperations make billions. This is true on fundamentally every level. Americans were blessed with an anomaly with industry following WW2, and due to greed and chasing never ending profits, blew it and the system is becoming exposed. America is desperately trying to avoid an ego death. Our transit is broken, political system broken, and people are polarized more then ever to help a R or D win elections, when behind closed doors laugh together as they rake in their profits. These politicians are all lobbied by a handful of very wealthy people, and this was the case during the ENTIRE guilded age. Instead of us being here to manufacture cheap, our purpose is to consume nonstop even if it doesn’t make sense, is unsustainable, and destroying our environment.",
