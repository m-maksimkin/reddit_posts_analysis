Did the county have to raise utility rates to make up for the shortfalls?\n\n>At her Monday sentencing hearing, Friedman noted that Bosworth used her money to pay for her kids’ schooling, *among other things,\"\n\nWhat are the other things: At least $100,000 compounding for her retirement, an expensive defense lawyer, etc.\n\n>Judge Hollie Gallagher said *because Chagrin Falls Mayor William Tomko did not ask for prison* in a letter read aloud in court and Bosworth paid back all the money, she would sentence Bosworth to probation.\n\nMayors have informal influence over the court system now? Probably her neighbor or some bullshit.\n\nShe lost her job, got another one somehow, and almost had worked out a plea deal where she probably would not have had to pay anything back, and held on to the remaining payment until the day of sentencing. And now her life goes on unperturbed.\n\nCase B:\nAssistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor James Gutierrez, like Brydle did with Bosworth, sought a prison sentence for Hopkins. *He told Bell that the state would be fine with a sentence of between nine and 12 months.*\n\nBell scolded Hopkins for taking her pension money, and sentenced her to 18 months in prison -- *six more months than Gutierrez requested.*",

First off, the phrase;\"innocent until proven guilty\" is 100% BS. It is actually the exact opposite. Cops want to arrest you. The D.A. wants to convict you. They could care less about facts. At least, in my experience. The judge is the most unwarranted power in the courtroom though. \n\nAlso, in an ideal world we would want to have empty jails.

Under Ohio law, the state can seize the money left in a public employee’s pension once they are convicted of theft in office. Bosworth had more than $200,000 in her pension and used that to pay back some money. She cut a check for the remaining $100,000 the day of her sentencing.\n\n>Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Ed Brydle asked the judge to send Bosworth to prison, but did not request a specific amount of time. Judge Hollie Gallagher said because Chagrin Falls Mayor William Tomko did not ask for prison in a letter read aloud in court and Bosworth paid back all the money, she would sentence Bosworth to probation.\n\n=======================================\n\n> Karla Hopkins worked as a secretary and executive assistant at Maple Heights High School. Her job was to collect various dues and fees **from teachers and students** and turn in money and receipts to the school treasurer. Hopkins kept $42,000 out of more than $71,000 she collected for a year, an audit later determined. She was indicted in May 2020 on a single count of third-degree felony theft in office.\n\nShe also plead “not guilty”.\n\n> Hopkins told Bell that she **emptied her pension** -- she didn’t know how much was in it but said, after taxes, she received about $20,000 -- to pay her bills **after the school fired her**. Her attorney, Bret Jordan, said that **she began stealing the money while dealing with mental health issues and her gambling addiction** but has since gotten treatment and gone through a job placement program. In the meantime, she came up with $5,000 to pay toward her restitution.\n\n\nSo one lady plead no contest and paid the money back entirely.\n\nThe other literally stole from students and teachers to fund her gambling habit, and plead “not guilty”.
