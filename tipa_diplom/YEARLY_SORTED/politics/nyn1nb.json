Does anybody in this thread actually know anybody who genuinely likes the concept of tipping?\n\nYou might argue that the customer gets better service if there is an incentive for employees to work hard for that extra tip. The problem is that tipping is far too often completed dissociated with the quality of service and not always the fault of the would-be tip receiver. \n\nI don't feel like any consumer should have the ability to deny another person their ability to pay for the things they need to live (and continue working!) because they were upset that their steak came out overcooked.\n\nThere's already a free market mechanism in place to filter out bad restaurants and bad employees. Didn't like how you were treated? Don't go back. I never tip poorly if I get bad food or bad service, I just complain and if that doesn't satisfy me I don't go back. No need for me to equally punish the waitstaff, hostess, dishwasher, busboys, etc for the one negative experience I had.\n\nEliminate tipping. Factor sales tax into prices. Pay everyone a living wage. There, life just got a whole lot easier for a ton of people. The billionaire class will be mad about it, but they'll get over it in a day or two after crying themselves to sleep in their money pits.\n\nEDIT: To all the waitstaff and bartenders replying to me who love tips so much, remember my post the next time you get stiffed on a cover and ask yourself if relying on the generosity of others is preferable to being compensated for your work with a fair wage. If your restaurant is raking in massive profits, they should be paying you close to what you were earning with tips.",

When I say living wage it should be around $15-$30 per hour based on location plus benefits (health insurance, 401k). Tipping still exist in non tipping culture. So that would be extra.

Your pay is between you and your boss. It’s not my job to supplement your pay except through the cost of your product. If service is part of your product, work it into your advertised price as overhead, like every other normal business does. \n\nThe fact that your boss isn’t willing to agree to pay you the equivalent of what you make currently in tips means he or she doesn’t think you are worth that price. If they fear adding that additional cost to their menu prices will drive customers away, then that means your boss thinks you aren’t worth that price to the customer either. \n\nEither way, how is that my fault? If your sign says your product costs $X, i expect to pay $X. End of story.

Some don’t like the volatility of wages from day to day, but it’s never bothered me because it all averages out in the end.",

I tell every server I hire they will never make less than $15/hr if for some reason they have a ‘bad week’. I will personally make up the difference in their paycheck. \n\nI am only required by law to make sure they make at least $7.25 which is ridiculous, no human is worth less than $15 for an hour of work from them.\n\nThere are very few ‘professional’ servers that do this for a long term living. The ones that are professionals are making more than $25-$30/hr. Server jobs are typically transitional. It’s a high burnout rate/high turnover dealing with customers and frankly some owners/managers and co-workers.\n\nIt is also one of the most LUCRATIVE part time jobs you can get very easily. Some owners/managers suck and take advantage by bending/breaking rules and use servers as a labor saver.\n\nThe fix is simple imho. We do not need to reinvent the wheel. When minimum wage gets increased, keep tip credit at $2.13/hr. This allows tipping to continue. This allows servers working in good restaurants to continue making 25-30/hr. This makes poorly run restaurants and owners that don’t care about a living wage pay then the difference to $15 if they don’t provide the environment for them to do so. This also allows for guests to not see a 10-15% increase in all restaurant prices across the US.\n\nReading the comments as a restaurant owner really makes me wish people would look into where/how restaurants make money. We are not rich. My wife and I make on average about $12/hr all said and done. My cooks make $20/hr. My support staff averages $15-$17/hr. An average restaurant makes about 10% after everything is paid for. A good restaurant can get that to 16-18%.\n\nThankfully I love what I do and I love my restaurant family. I don’t agree with tipping but it’s also a monster we created. It creates income inequality in a restaurant. \n\nAnd for those who say ‘be the leader in getting rid of tipping’ go look at the track record of an individual restaurant trying to change the rules. 90% of them go back to tipping. Yes there are indeed a few isolated examples of restaurants that have done this very successfully and kudos to them! To remain competitive in a small market the rules would have to change for everyone to make this happen. Independent restaurants do not have the same margins as chains and most could not absorb the cost.\n\nNote: tip credit is a below minimum amount you are allow to pay someone. You are 100% as an owner required to make up any pay under current federal minimum wage.",

And yep, I don't want to advocate for something that the subject doesn't want but with respect it's madness.  I can only think that it's not clear that in Europe and the UK, tipping *still happens*.  It's just that a) I'm going to tip if you do a great job, and if I don't I don't have to concern myself that you aren't making rent, and b) I want all of my tip to go towards the person I'm tipping.  If I add ten pounds as a tip to the server, they're delighted, not pissed off that it isn't more.\n\nWhich brings me to another point.  Any pretense of \"creating a meritocracy\" goes out of the window when it comes to the practice of tipping out the house.  I get sharing tips with back-house staff.  But breakages and mistakes are the cost of doing business, not something that you get to *charge your employees for*.\n\nThe whole damned system is a symptom of capitalist leaders tightening the screws on the working class.  And in effect, they've created a system in which the wages of the working class are tied directly to the moods, whims and wealth of the middle and upper class.  It's a yoke.  And there is nobody like the US for ferociously defending the whip that is being used on them in the hopes that they'll get a go eventually.",

The restaurants exploit the 2.13 an hour in labor to have servers do everything but cooking.  Note that a lot of restaurants still have servers do light kitchen prep and food prep like setting up and garnishing dishes, prepping salads and soups along with cutting veggies and other basics.  Servers are never expected to work with ovens, stoves, or burners.\n\nIt is not uncommon to have servers come in an hour before open and clean the restaurant and set up for open while only paying them 2.13 an hour.  The same happens when the restaurant closes, cheap cleaning service and labor for 2.13 an hour without tables.  I haven't seen a restaurant paying servers more than 2.13 an hour for being at the restaurant before open or after close even though they are no longer serving.\n\nWhile the restaurant is open servers are often doing the job of hosts, bartenders, dish, bussers, food runners, during non peak hours.  Why pay people who get paid more than 2.13 an hour to do their job when when you can have servers who are paid 2.13 an hour in labor do it?\n\nWhen the restaurants get busy they have the hosts, bartenders, dish, bussers and food runners scheduled then immediately cut most of that staff when the restaurant slows down and again have the servers who are only paid 2.13 an hour take over while also serving their tables.\n\nRestaurants are quick to cut people who are paid 8-10 dollars an hour like hosts,  food runners, etc, but will keep servers around for hours without tables to fill in these jobs during the slow periods.  It is not uncommon for restaurants to hang on to servers and have them clean for hours a week while only having no tables just in case the restaurant gets busy (or because they are only paying 2.13 an hour in labor for service work to clean the restaurant).\n\nNot only that but every restaurant I have worked at takes around 15-20% of the servers tips and uses that to pay the hosts, bartenders, dish, bussers and food runners.  This is not optional, the managers take a percentage of the servers sales away from their tips and gives it to other employees.\n\nAs a bonus, very few restaurants who pay 2.13 an hour offer servers holiday pay, sick pay, sick days, any form of vacation or vacation pay.  You either work or you don't get paid.",

See http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped.htm#foot2 for each state's requirements - and although most states do require that the employer \"make up the difference\" (for instance, if there is a weather condition and the work is \"slow\" during the worker's shift), but many of the workers are afraid to complain for fear of losing their jobs - which is one of the reasons why those workers (especially at low to lower mid-range restaurants) are often earning well below the poverty level despite generally working 40 (or more) hours/week. Note that because fast food places don't normally have any tipping (excluding pizza places), those workers tend to be paid at least \"regular\" minimum wage. Throw in the customers who believe that a 10% tip is \"plenty\" (that's what should be tipped on PICK UP ORDERS: there is still a worker getting that order ready, the pots & pans used still have to be washed, the rent and utilities still have to be paid, the \"to go\" containers have to be purchased - as well as \"unique\" condiments, like sweet and sour sauce for Asian restaurants or taco sauce for Mexican restaurant, which come in \"high priced\" not even a single serving packet - etc). Note that a few restaurants have gone to paying their workers a living wage and charging for their menu items accordingly (and they generally post that no tipping is required) and are doing just fine years after they started the \"experiment\". On the other hand, servers and bartenders at high end establishments often fight that idea (some would lose money - the folks who can afford to pay $50-100 per person for the meal plus a like amount for \"adult beverages\" apparently tip quite well).  Meanwhile, folks scream about both raising the minimum wage (and service industries that count on folks to tip fight it hardest) AND the folks who have to rely on minimum wage being a \"burden\" on their tax dollars.",
