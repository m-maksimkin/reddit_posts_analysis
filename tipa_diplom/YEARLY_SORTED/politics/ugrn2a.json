Then also allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy.  That will alleviate unlimited loans being sent out and put a downward pressure on tuition prices.

What we really need are reforms that lower that cost to a much more reasonable and sustainable $30-50, so average Americans can actually afford college in the first place.\n\nAfter all, every single time we’ve increased financial aid in the past, it has led to significantly increased tuition and larger student loan balances. That’s how we got into this mess in the first place. Rather than forcing colleges to offer an experience people can actually afford, we keep throwing more subsidies at the problem and removing price sensitivity from the college selection process. Meanwhile the schools turn around and construct more $100 million buildings, offer more useless classes and majors, and more niche student services rather than focusing on affordability. The average campus today is terribly bloated and inefficient.\n\nWe were FINALLY starting to see trends toward affordability in enrollment with students choosing in-state vs out-of-state, public vs private, commuter or online programs vs residential, or even skilled trades and apprenticeships instead of college.

Any attempt to tackle the debt problem needs to take into consideration what the potential outcomes are. One of those could be a wealth transfer to people who simply haven't bothered to pay back their loans (I said \"potential\", meaning I know it does not apply to everyone with student debt). Consider three cases:\n\nA, B and C went to college and financed their education via loans. Let's assume all of them majored in a similar field. A prioritized paying back his debt by living frugally. B only paid the minimum and used his money to buy a house instead (alternatively B wasted the money on whatever). C had some unlucky circumstances and barely managed to pay minimums on his debt. Would be fair to unconditionally forgive B and C their student debt? You can make a case for C but why would you help B and indirectly punish A for prioritizing debt repayment over wealth accumulation?\n\nI think any debt forgiveness program needs to take into account the current employment and assets of any debtor who is applying for it (to be able to answer the question why someone is not able to repay the loan). 0% loans are also a tool that should be employed. \n\nLastly, the money people borrowed came from somewhere. If federal loans are forgiven, the public will need to eat the cost (most likely in form of higher or additional taxes or a budget cut for other federal expenses; to think that taxing corporations or billionaires for this is naive because it will just not happen).",

My wife and I did it by sacrificing hard. Ruthlessly prioritizing our budget, working multiple jobs, shopping for groceries on a discount, coupon cutting, using old phones, driving old cars, not contributing to retirement, not eating out and socializing with friends, etc. Yes, we had good jobs but we also made it our singular focus to pay our loans off because that was the agreement I signed. \n\nSo, yes paying them off is doable. Telling those who did it to “suck it up” is only going to curry short term gains and I’d venture to say hurt the democrat party more in the long run. Do I want some form of forgiveness for others? Absolutely! School and tuition reform? There better be. What else? Figure out a way to incentivize those that also sacrificed to pay their loans off. Fuck, can we not walk and chew gum?",

It makes sense to forgive loans and reduce costs of education going forward so that everyone's working with the same information (level playing field).  It makes less sense to do it retroactively because it dicks over those who made decisions using current information.\n\nIf loans are forgiven, perhaps those who went to school and paid off their loans should also be given a check to offset the sacrifices they made to accomplish that.  If you think that handing a check to people who made that sacrifice is wrong...well 'We can support things we won't directly benefit from'.",

Introduce a whole new generation of folks who will not have to make that sacrifice, who in essence will come out ahead in life of those who paid, will saturate the market with educated employees and all that comes with that like employers being more capable of finding people willing to work for less for the same job. I just do not forsee anyone willingly giving up what they worked for, unless they are already comfortable with what they have accomplished in life, through altruism alone, especially when presumably the working population would then also be required, presumably, to not only have paid for their education, but subsidize those who benefit through this through an increase in taxes.

Altruism would be advocating for something you do not personally benefit from, like reining in college tuition for future students. I wholly support that.\n\n\nI'm fine with 0% interest rates, something I did not get. I'd go as far as crediting interest paid toward the original principal, something I did not get.

Frankly many of my peers paid their minimums, and bought homes, and have gained a massive asset as a result, while still paying minimums. Even, in many cases, asking for deferments they did not actually need. I want more data on that- I only have anecdote. But out of 15 pp I know with graduate school student loans, 14 of them did that. \n\nSo I paid my Loans off early.  But to do so, I delayed buying a home by 10+ yr, and I lost that asset growth in comparison.  And now my taxes will be going to pay off some portion of the loans of those same peers that have net assets much higher than mine because they made a less responsible choice.  SO yeah, I resent that. Because if you are my peer?  You do not NEED any forgiveness. We make plenty of income, they are just choosing not to pay this off. \n\nIn contrast, I fully support complete forgiveness for kids that never finished- and make the universities that conned those kids into getting those loans for an education they had no intention of ever providing (only 30% of us ever finish our degrees- That is by design for revenue), should be asked to subsidize that too.  I am 100% ok with forgiving that- those kids never got the asset they paid for, and were manipulated at a young age into that debt that went to growing admin at universities so we have 18 deans for every professor now.  \n\nI am also 100% supportive of fixing the public service programs aggressively, so that those that went into lower paid roles in their career areas in order to serve the public good are not completely screwed by that choice. \n\nI get that it is easiest to just do a blanket forgiveness, and programs are not always fair.  And as such I am generally supportive of these policies.  But don't pretend that some of us are subsidizing others by being responsible vs selfish. It 100% happens. And it is annoying.  The fair thing would be to yes, have a means test- make it flexible, make it fair- realize that NYC is different than Lincoln, NE, etc. OR refund the amount of the forgiveness up to what we would still owe if we paid off early.  I paid mine off 8 yr ago- if I paid my minimums I would still owe more than $25k. But That would require actual work and oversight- since so many services are so awful, because they have little oversite, that is unlikely to work. \n\nSo, fine, do a flat forgiveness- because in the larger picture it is the right thing to do. But don't act like those of us that are a little resentful are the selfish ones.",

People are struggling to pay car loans and credit cards. The laser focus on student loans exclusively is quite regressive in many ways:\n\n* It doesn't help people who couldn't afford/chose not to go college at all.\n* College students are statistically more likely to come from wealthier families, even those with high debt levels.\n* People who chose to sacrifice to pay off their loans are punished for making an otherwise smart decision.\n* People who chose to attend community college or a cheaper state university are punished for making an otherwise smart decision.\n* People paying college loans usually have more disposable income AFTER their loan payments than those who didn't attend college at all.\n* It doesn't fix the root cause of the problem: Rising tuition, loans that are too easy to get (by design), and the poor decision making of many students and their families.\n\nI understand the argument: \"you suffered, why should everyone else suffer too?\" I get it.

For example, some people believe cancellation would be regressive because statistically it would most help white, high income potential individuals, thereby further widening the racial income inequality gap. Others believe that such an act is unconstitutional and gives the executive branch far more power than it should. Others believe that without fixing the root cause of the problem, we’re only applying an expensive bandaid on the problem. Others believe that in a high inflation environment, applying this would be equivalent to a stimulis further compounding risk of out of control inflation.\n\nPersonally, I’m in support of student loan cancellation especially if there’s a more equitable mode through which it is applied (e.g. if it was applied in a more targetted way) but I am tired of seeing the same strawman beat to death everyday on Reddit.

Proponents suggest this helps students while also helping everyone else that were forced to or chose the workforce or are suffering from the lockdowns and current inflation. Giving to everyone, providing relief to everyone & nobody feeling left out etc. \n\nI’ve heard rumblings from folks I work with both w/ college degrees (some still paying) and some without. The general consensus is everyone wants their pound of flesh and are willing to vote one way or other if they’re left out. For context, I live in a mostly blue Midwest state and folks are mad. Mad at the state of our nation, it’s infrastructure, their wages, inflation and costs, debts, political bs, etc etc etc. a general hopelessness.\n\nObviously student loan lending needs to be revised. Interest needs to be capped at 1-2%. Allow people to include student loan debt in bankruptcy. Fixing this system for future generations prior to handing out forgiveness checks is the best case scenario. \n\nThe cost to give 10k to the 50 million people that filed tax returns is less than giving 50k to 43 million student debt owners.

It's a shame they're still the lowest voting demographic by capita lol.\n\n- As a side note, Reddit is really the only place this takes such a serious note. The majority of this forgiveness only helps people that are -already- very well off compared to the majority of democratic voters. It helps only the middle and upper class with very little of it affecting the majority of actual constituents. The vast majority of these people do not need the forgiveness.

You need to lend your money, car, or even house to people, not just friends and family, but everyone. Then when it time to be paid or give back, you must not accept anything. Wanting to do things with other peoples’ money, but do not hold themselves to that own standard (likely given an excuse if “well, I would if I could”) are indeed hypocrites. \nI do not personally like bankers or government representatives, but I am a person of principle. I was taught at a young age, if you borrow something, give it back. If you break something, you better work until you can replace it. Perhaps that’s just being a privileged first generation American with immigrant parents and an absent father who grew up in poverty… What a crazy thought that you shouldn’t take what you can’t give back.\nBut guess what… my mother worked 2 jobs and went to school and sacrificed dearly for me. I was so thankful that I was given the opportunity to borrow money to attend school. I struggled socially, academically and economically, but I worked very hard and graduated with pretty good grades. I landed an entry level job, ate rice and eggs, didn’t go out or spend on anything I didn’t need and saved up until my loan interest started accruing. Then I put everything I saved into my loan payments because I needed to uphold my end of my agreement. I didn’t have an enjoyable life, I made decisions and sacrifices that not many would be willing to because people seem to think they deserve everything. I was debt free and am going to attend graduate school and take out more loans because I believe it will return the investment, not because it’s fun.\nI’m sure there are a small percent of those who borrowed loans and something very severe happened to them like truly debilitating issues. But for the majority of those who want their obligation to be wiped clean, it’s because they either did not sacrifice like they should, or they made many bad decisions and want to get bailed out for their mistakes. Either way, it’s pretty sad that people cannot look inward and take personal reasonability but a kid who was bullied with a broken home and no resources could make it, what’s your excuse? \nHold yourself to a higher standard, and ask yourself, “what could I honestly have done to not put myself in this situation” and DO NOT blame others. No one forged your signature on the loan agreement, the internet is available and assuming you know how to type, you can walk to a public library and research if taking out 10s or 100s of thousands of dollars to get a degree is worth it.

It’s a midterm year and this approach would not solve any of the root causes of rising education costs. \n\nI currently have a smaller amount of student loans from a public university. This is an important problem to solve as it prevents people from fully participating in the economy and having a good quality of life. This would be a significant GDP boast. Education costs (tuition and room and board) are astronomically high compared to earlier generations. It’s a big disadvantage. \n\nHowever, only around 15% of American adults have student loans. This does not target the majority of US citizens and may lead to negative ramifications from the working class + others that paid off their loan previously. Would private university loans from questionable schools be removed as well? I’d vouch for reforming the current system before absolving student loan debt. \n\n\nSolutions: \n\n- Allow option for bankruptcy. Student loans are the only type of debt that can’t be easily removed compared to other debt. \n\n- Explore the idea of reforming how the government runs the student loan program. The Federal government has assisted with student loans since 1965. Unfortunately, the government is a terrible market actor and doesn’t handle these types of things in an efficient way. Government is great for incentives but terrible for making market decisions as oftentimes leads to higher costs. \n\n- Our gov student loan system is not efficient and the ease of handing out loans to everyone (regardless if someone can pay it back) is the main driver in higher education costs. Majors that are in demand and that lead to jobs are less risky and may qualify for higher $ in loans vs majors that are not in demand.  \n\n- States have dramatically decreased funding for public universities over the years but admin costs have steadily increased to very high levels. How can the fed and state governments work to improve schools while preventing high admin costs? \n\n- Decreasing interest rates to near 0 for current borrowers.",

A formal education isnt needed to make a living contrary to popular belief. So if a person is interested in further education it comes at their expense, because that education may only benefit that individual. Only highly technical jobs need a degree to perform them. But on that note, you dont hear from those people because their career can reimburse the education it took to get the job.

            "text": "I think Democrats have a huge messaging problem. They constantly want people to view things from another perspective, but there are a lot of people who are just not wired that way. A huge issue for the Democrats, and something that has been a problem for a long time, is that they don't speak to poor whites very much. Yes, the Affordable Care Act is something that was meant to help them, but it's something  they got no credit for, and in some cases, Republicans are trying to take credit for it.\n\nI've seen blue collar people post on social media complaining, asking why they should be giving free money to people who went to college and couldn't find a job, when there are blue collar people who could potentially use the money for their businesses. From that perspective, I could see how it's unfair. It feels like in the media, we're talking about how we need to support only certain groups of people.\n\nI used to be friends with a white guy who was a waiter. He probably had some advantages in life just being white, but his life wasn't necessarily easy. He was frustrated always hearing how he had such advantages compared to others. He might have had advantages, he might not have had advantaged. We spend a lot of time talking about race in the US, and race issues are certainly a problem. But we also have issues based on wealth/social status.\n\nSome poor white people can identify where they might have an advantage against others. But there are other people who feel beat down by life who want more help and feel they are being ignored. That's part of why some of these populist movements have become so popular. \n\nThis is obviously an oversimplification, but you're not going to convince anyone by saying, 'We can support things we won't directly benefit from.' This falls in line with how a lot of people complain that Democrats think they are smarter than Republicans. In some cases, value systems are just very drastically different. I'm not trying to say one side is good and one side is bad (that's another debate), but quotes like what are in the headline won't really solve anything.",

How about making the system better, like not actually letting 18 yr olds take out huge sums of money a lot aren't able to pay back. Especially considering the size of the debt as a whole is second only to mortgages. So how about the Government not backing loans in this way. Or even since education is a societal and public good maybe the cost of a university going down (there are tons of ways to do this, trimming the fat in administration is a good start. Because the loans are federally backed the schools can essentially set whatever cost they want and make it seem reasonable by increasing it every year. etc.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou could setup a fund where anyone who CHOOSES to help those struggling with student loan debt can pay into it, kinda like a GoFundMe/Patreon, but with some simple oversight.

The fundamental problem is most college degrees aren't with the paper they're printed on.

Getting the government to pay for this schooling isn't a solution... at least not a very good one. Society needs to get rid of the misconception that ANY 4y degree is something to aspire to and will be a ticket to move up the social ladder. It simply isn't.

That’s no different than gambling losses or Ponzi scams that you got yourself into. School costs too much, yep and so does a lot of shit you shouldn’t buy into. If you don’t like the debt, don’t do biz with con artists that took over colleges a long time ago. You don’t think you can get a job without college? Maybe don’t be so narcissistic and perhaps get a labor job first if you’re able bodied. Work your way up and be disciplined instead of hoping you’ll be my boss right out of school because you think you can pay your way right to the top. Nope, it took me 15 years of living very frugal to become stable and middle class wages- I mowed yards and learned how to build shit and got paid garbage for years while I patiently saved money and avoided indolence.

So I was literally day trading during Architecture class my senior year of High School. I genuinely did that because my parents took $2,000 out of my bank account during my junior year of high school to make a mortgage payment one month. They didn't tell me they were going to withdraw that amount, so that almost gave me anxiety attack when I looked at my account balance. I had been lending my parents money since I was 15 to pay for the internet or the phone bill and once the electric bill.\n\nBut that made me want to study econ and really made me want to read everything I could related to the economy and the stock markets. After high school I did 2 years of community college then transferred to UMD which I had wanted to go to since I was 6. But after 3 years of investing I saw a good enough ROI that I could cash out and use it to pay for Maryland. I should probably mention that my parents never applied for financial aid for me like ever, which honestly does still upset me a little years later.

NACA still made money off my loan, they just didn’t make a killing off me.\n\n    Oh , and for airlines, why didn’t the government and huge companies just be allowed to pre buy travel books to prop up airlines years ago. That way no bail out is needed . There just pre selling future seats to save their company instead of free money from out taxes.

All while colleges engage in predatory tactics to get all of the money that was injected into the system. The problem then compounds because students need more debt to pay for a degree that will likely not be able to pay for itself. Colleges need to be accountable for their “education” they provide. In any normal loan scenario you need to be able to prove you will be able to pay it back. If we start implementing a system where colleges prove their worth before kids get loans to attend, then both prices of college and outstanding loans will decrease.

What can we give them? Just print more money. Who cares if a steak is $100 or gas $10. Just take a loan out to pay for them then beg for forgiveness. \n These people signed a contract, took the money. Pay it back. How about those of us that paid in full for their kids educations?

            "text": "1. I know you can get a high paying job without a degree. However, you can also get a high paying job without a high school education. Trade schools are also an option but I didn’t even know what a trade school was until I was almost done with my college degree. In my company, you’re more likely to get paid more as an electrician than as an engineer. After a few years, our electricians make upwards of $130,000-$150,000 a year. I’ve never been exposed to that information though so I thought that was impossible. \n\n2. When you have you parents and teachers telling you that you need to graduate grade school, many people do it because they’re pressured into it. There’s plenty of kids in the US that just don’t finish because they don’t have the motivation, and society dictates that “these kinds of people” get hooked on drugs, commit crime, or something negative. Parents don’t want that, so the argument becomes finish school  or you’ll be a gangbanger. If you’ve been finishing school because you HAVE TO, you’ll go to college because you HAVE TO and you’ll take loans because you HAVE to.\n\n3. People go to school because employers have a tendency to equate education to experience. The better your education is, the more likely you are to be picked over other candidates for higher paying jobs. An employer will be far more impressed with a degree from MIT or Stanford than they will from a community college.\n\n4. At higher end universities, you gain access to resources non-students are locked out from. Most of these universities have career fairs and internship opportunities that are exclusive to that university. For example, many companies, including mine and even the top Fortune 100 companies, only put recruiting funds and award internships towards their chosen core schools. The better the school is, the better the companies are that have selected it as a core school.  They allow candidates from these schools access to special, fast track career paths, higher paid internships, and have aggressive career prep departments.\n\n5. If you’re attending mostly or fully, on loans, by the time you graduate, your loan amount is so high, that even with a high paying job, your loan principals are at a level where you can’t even cover your interest.  Student loans percentages are more than double most mortgages. So what’s left? You get placed into an income based repayment plan where your minimum payments don’t even cover your interest and it grows until you either default or reach your 25 year forgiveness. \n\n6. Say you’re in income based repayment. Are you going to wait 25 years before you can put a down payment on a house and start a family? Not a chance. \n\nSo you make minimum payments for years to get your life together, find a partner and start a family on a $60,000-$80,000 salary while some lender sells your debt off as a security to some rich investors. They own you now and the interest you’re paying allows them to pay their children’s tuitions upfront. \n\nNow it’s 10 years later and your initial $200,000 loan now has a remaining principal of $250,000 despite having paid back $175,000 so far. You finally score that high paying job you wanted, you have a house & kids. Just when you think you can finally stop living paycheck to paycheck, you get kicked out of income based repayment for earning too much. Now your loan payments increase by 300% or more, you have less money coming in than when you earned half as much and,  in the case you ever become eligible for income based repayment, your forgiveness period resets back to 25 years. What do you do if you incur a large emergency cost? Nothing you can do because you have no savings and student debt doesn’t qualify for bankruptcy. \n\nSo now you’re 50 and you’ve finally either paid off your loans or have reached forgiveness. You still have no savings but you can at least save enough to put a down payment on a house and maybe a nicer car. Out of one debt and into another so you can forget about retiring until you’re 70-75. If you have kids, you now watch them go into the same cycle because you weren’t able to save for their college. \n\nThis was what I was living through before Covid hit and interest-free deferment saved me. When it literally takes global pandemic to get you in a situation where you can pay off your loans and finally start living your life, you realize how screwed the hundreds of thousands of others are who don’t have your 6 figure salary or zero percent interest. They become indentured servants and don’t realize it until 4-6 years later when it’s too late to do anything about it.",
