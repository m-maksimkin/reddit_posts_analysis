It is not even been scheduled for discussion much less a Committee vote to put it on the floor. If you wonder why that is, remember we have the richest House and Senate in history. To pass Bernie‚Äôs legislation, the Congress would have to slap the corporations, donors, and other uber wealthy that made them that way with a huge tax increase.
