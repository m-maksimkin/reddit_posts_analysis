As a forewarning, the following information is very unsettling and will explain why Carter never ‚Äúkept his promise‚Äù of revealing classified UFO information to the public.\n\nAccording to the story that was corroborated by more than one witness, U.S. presidents are only given a cursory overview of the subject.¬†Apparently, the CIA runs the program, only provide information to the President on a need to know basis, and do not consider presidential curiosity as sufficient need to know. This was implemented after Kennedy, and all presidents after him have been given only summary briefings (some presidents for unknown reasons were given more than others).\n\nOkay on to your question. President Carter is a deeply religious man who had also witnessed a UFO with 6 other people. Everyone thought that he would be the one to finally release UFO info to the public but as the story goes, he was repeatedly stonewalled. Eventually, the CIA had ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù with him, and afterward it was reported that he sunk his head in his hands and not only began to deeply sob, but was visibly disturbed for some weeks afterward.\n\nWhat was he told and shown?\n\nHe was told that the major religions including Christianity were programs created by extraterrestrials to prevent us from destroying ourselves while they ran their experiments on us ‚Äì and that they made us.¬†At this moment it became clear to Carter that such information could cause tremendous economic and social upheaval",

This is setting aside the fact that he is (likely deliberately) confusing his lawsuit over applications for mail-in ballots and the ballots themselves.\n\nIn [Harris County](https://www.harrisvotes.com/HISTORY/20201103/Official%20Cumulative.pdf), Biden won 918,193 votes to Trump‚Äôs  700,630. Considering only absentee votes, Biden won 114,103 absentee votes to Trump‚Äôs 61,681 absentee votes.\n\nThere are 2,431,457 voters in Harris county of which 1,656,686 voted (68.14 percent voter turnout, above the national average of [66.3 percent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/voter-turnout/)), and 774,771 did not vote. \n\nTrump won by Texas by 631,221 votes. If all 774,771 additional Harris County voters voted for Biden, then Biden would have won Texas by 143,550 votes.\n\nIf the 774,771 additional absentee votes in Harris County voted absentee and split along the same percentages that they did for the absentee votes actually cast, 64.45 percent to Biden and 34.84 percent to Trump, then Biden would have received an additional 514,835 votes and Trump an additional 269,930 votes. \n\nIn this more realistic scenario (because no candidate would receive 100 percent of more than 700,000 absentee votes) Biden would have won a total of 1,433,028 and Trump would have won a total of 970,560 votes in Harris County. Biden would have a net gain of 462,468 votes which is not enough to close the actual 631,221 vote gap between candidates.\n\n**TL;DR** Paxton is full of shit.",

In some districts turnout was as high as 60%, and some districts had higher turnout than during the last presidential election. [1]\n\nDemocrats gained 40 seats in the House of Representatives. [2]\n\nDemocrats also picked up seven governorships in 2018, and two more in 2019, in Kentucky and Louisiana. [3][4][5]\n\nDemocrats picked up more than 300 seats in state legislatures, and over half of the Attorney General's seats in states across the country. In the states where Democrats did not get outright control of the state legislature, they were able to, in most cases, break Republican super-majorities. And in 2019, Democrats took full control of the Virginia state house for the first time since 1994.[6][7]\n\nAgain, voting matters.\n\nIf voting didn't matter, then Republicans in Arizona wouldn't have filed a lawsuit to prevent mail-in ballot counting in a very tight Senate race. [8]\n\nIf voting didn't matter, then Republicans in Florida wouldn't have filed a lawsuit to prevent a recount in a very close governor and Senate race. [9]\n\nIn Georgia, voters actually had to file a lawsuit in order to get Brian Kemp to resign as Secretary of State, so he would not be overseeing voting counts and recounts in that state. Which is something he should have done to begin with anyway in order to avoid conflicts of interest. [10]\n\nIf voting didn't matter, Georgia and Wisconsin wouldn't be attempting to purge 309,000 and 234,000 voters, respectively, from the rolls in their states. [11]\n\nIf voting didn't matter then the governor of Texas would not have ordered the removal of mail-in ballot drop boxes all over the state, which would have left one drop box per county. [12]\n\nIf voting didn't matter, Republicans in Texas (again) would not have attempted to get a judge to toss out 127,000 legally cast ballots. [13]\n\nIf voting didn't matter Trump would not have screwed around with the post office in an attempt to hinder mail-in votes. [14]  \n\nIf voting didn't matter then Ken Paxton would not have tried so hard to keep Texans from voting in 2020, which he now freely admits helped Trump win in Texas. Paxton's interference probably helped John Cornyn keep his Senate seat as well. [15]   \n\nThe previous list doesn't even take into account the new voter suppression laws that have been passed in Georgia, Florida, Utah, and Wyoming among others, or the laws that have been drafted but have yet to go through their respective state houses.\n\nBecause it bears repeating.\n\nVoting matters. If voting didn't matter the Republican party would not spend so much time and money attempting to keep people from voting.\n\nGo. Vote.\n\nSources:\n[1]https://www.npr.org/2018/11/08/665197690/a-boatload-of-ballots-midterm-voter-turnout-hit-50-year-high  \n[2]https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-house-elections.html  \n[3]https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/11/09/so-much-changed-in-statehouses-this-week-heres-what-it-all-means  \n[4]https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/elections-kentucky-mississippi-test-trump-s-political-power-n1075581  \n[5]https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/louisiana-gov-john-bel-edwards-wins-re-election-blow-trump-n1084236  \n[6]https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-gain-hundreds-of-legislative-seats-and-secure-majority-of-state-attorneys-general/2018/11/07/cef1ebd6-e2aa-11e8-ab2c-b31dcd53ca6b_story.html  \n[7]https://apnews.com/article/87ba998f09fd43359011e64fe0e68ad2  \n[8]https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/arizona-gop-sues-limit-mail-ballots-senate-race-n933866  \n[9]https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/415852-scott-sues-broward-supervisor-of-elections-as-florida-senate-race-spirals  \n[10]https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/06/voters-file-lawsuit-to-stop-georgia-gov-candidate-kemp-from-overseeing-election.html  \n[11]https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/17/georgia-purged-voters-its-rolls-its-second-state-make-cuts-less-than-week/  \n[12]https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/texas-mail-in-ballot-drop-off-vote-2020-election-b744020.html  \n[13]https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/10/texas-drive-through-voting-throw-out-ballots.html  \n[14]https://apnews.com/article/ece1f6e9cea1b2aa0a8c6af7ca003f26  \n[15]https://www.newsweek.com/texas-ag-says-trump-wouldve-lost-state-if-it-hadnt-blocked-mail-ballots-applications-being-1597909",

It has been parroted so many times now that it is part of standard dialogue, and countless people believe it. But people should be concerned at the actions of the Republican party..closing down poliing places, seeking to gain complete control of the election process, quietly and behind the scenes, legislating electoral districts out of existance, that farce with de Joy and USPS. And drivelling on about removing dead people off the electoral roll. How many, I speculate? Tens? hundreds? thousands?\nI occasionally wonder on the motives of the Republicans and their well-financed aiders and abetters, the right wing media..do they wish the DNC off the face of the earth along with all other inconvenient people?
