Let’s just look at the facts.   \nFacts  \n1.We Attacked Iraq unprovoked. They did not attack us, nor  \ndid they want to fight us.  \n2. We blatantly lied about WMDs. We clearly wanted to invade  \nIraq for geopolitical goals, and made about WMDs and other nonsense like  \n\"yellow cake\" to justify invading.  \n3. When we attacked Iraq, we directly attacked civilian  \ninfrastructure. Many Iraqis went without electricity and water for more then a  \nyear.  \n4. It is reported that more then 185,000–208,000 civilian  \ndeaths occurred because of the Iraq war.  \n5.The Iraq war destabilized the religion, and Iraqi  \nChristians were forced to leave when ISIS showed up. They lived there for  \nthousands of years.  \nI am not saying all this to be a bleeding heart liberal. I'm very conservative. I  \ndid deploy to Iraq in a combat MOS, 13b, I was used as in a infantry capacity  \nduring the conflict and served near the Iraq Iran boarder. I just don't  \nunderstand the \"we da good guys, they the bad guys\". Russia is  \nclearly attacking the Ukraine for geopolitical reasons that serve Russian  \ninterests, much like the war in Iraq. Neither one of these wars meet the  \ncriteria of Christian just war doctrine. Democracy is not a prerequisite for  \nmoral just Christian society, nor does US foreign policy represent anything  \nother than serving national interests, \"making the world safe for  \ndemocracy\" is a propaganda term. Think its best that we put aside  \nnationalist bias when looking at conflicts like these. So when I say that it  \nlooks like Russia is using restraint, I mean that in the context of recent  \nunprovoked conflicts. That is not a compliant to Putin. This does not make me a  \nRussian supporter. I am so sick of Jingoistic neolibs and neoconsertives. I pray for Russia and the Ukraine, this war needs to stop.",

            "text": "Mitt Romney is a relic of a defunct conservative party that has long sold out to corporate interests. You can't really call the republicans conservatives anymore. They're not conserving anything. If I recall, an old philosopher, travelling through the US in the last century, made the statement, \"The democrats make the mistake and the republicans don't fix them.\"  \n\n\nThis is the massive blunder the dual oligarchic party system brings. Until real voices are allowed to make themselves known, rather than simply who makes the most money, the North American Union will never be able to properly respect the rights and interests of its citizens. More jobs will be given to other countries at the US's expense. This will have a detrimental effect on the Union's capacity to protect its own political interests. Or any of its interests for that matter. Mitt Romney, like General Floyd and several other politicians, have sold out the United State for selfish gain. Especially when it comes to the cheap labor of countries like China, India and Vietnam.   \n\n\nI find it astonishing that he dares declare that anyone who shows even the most nominal sense of even-headedness concerning the situation in Ukraine is an \"almost traitor\", when he's doing Xi Jing Ping's bidding and insulting republicans whilst demanding that they vote for him.  \n\n\nPutin has made three demands of President Zelensky:  \n\n\n1. Do not join NATO or the European Union.\n2. Respect the rights of ethnic Russians in Donbas\n3. A complete denazification of Ukranian government officials  \n\n\nIn retrospect, this doesn't seem unreasonable. There seems to be a lot that we're not being told. But with these demands, it seems that Zelensky is willing to put Ukranian lives at risk to forcibly remove any Russians from Ukraine and to join NATO. If Ukraine joins NATO, this will mean that nuclear weapons will be brought into the region, which Putin has said, is not acceptable. Remember that the reason he's invading is to ensure that this doesn't happen. People in the west can call the Russians the aggressors, but that's to remove any responsibility they have in attempting to place nuclear weapons in Ukraine and to increase Russian border spending. In essence, I doubt Putin felt that he had a choice in the matter, but to invade.\n\nWe should never glorify anyone. Putin has his downsides as well. And so does Zelensky. So taking a side when nuclear weapons are involved is a foolhardy response. Remember that nobody wins in a nuclear war. \n\nBut for those of you who can't be expected to have a reasonable argument about a matter that is probably poorly understood and heavily propagandized by the media (shocking I know), you should go play that new Elden Ring game that just came out three days ago. It's great! I love it! This might give you a chance to relax, and think with a clear head. It wasn't that long ago that Canada's Prime Minister Trudeau, ran over an old lady who was peacefully protesting the vaccine passports and other stuff.  \n\n\nPoliticians are just bitter old people tricking the young into killing each other. And there is a lot of lying going on.",

            "text": "I’ve been going over some of the Trump era rhetoric toward NATO. The 2018 summit got lost with all the other drama, but this bit is pretty prescient:\n\n> This past July, on the final day of the nato summit in Brussels, Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, proposed a closed-door emergency meeting. The emergency was Donald Trump. Minutes earlier, the President had arrived late to a session where the **Presidents of Ukraine and Georgia were making their case to join nato**. Trump interrupted their presentation and unleashed a verbal assault on the members of the alliance, calling them deadbeats and free riders on American power. Trump threatened to go his “own way” if they didn’t immediately pay more for their own defense. His barrage centered on Merkel, Europe’s longest-serving democratic leader.\n\nTrumo was looking for excuses to sour the US’s opinion of NATO, and idiots ate that up. He was undermining the alliance that is Putin’s number one problem. And what a coincidence that this outburst comes just as Ukraine and Georgia are making their case for membership. Hmmm….\n\n> “You, Angela,” Trump chided Merkel. Most of nato’s members had failed to fulfill the goal of spending two per cent of G.D.P. for defense, but Trump focussed on Germany’s military spending of just over one per cent of G.D.P. In front of television cameras the previous day, he had accused Germany of being “totally controlled by Russia,” because of a proposed new gas pipeline. His tweets that day sounded like blackmail. “What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? The U.S. is paying for Europe’s protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.”\n\nIn fact, the [US trade deficit with Europe had gone up during Trump’s tenure, and Europe had upped their NATO spending prior to Trump taking office](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/12/factchecking-trumps-nato-remarks/). Under Trump, it continued to go up, but they were under no obligation to do so and they had been doing that of their own accord. They didn’t owe us anything. \n\n>And yet, when he emerged from the meeting and spoke with reporters, Trump lied, claiming not only that his allies had capitulated to him but also that they would consider his demand to raise their annual military spending to four per cent of G.D.P., an assertion so politically impossible that Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, immediately issued a public rebuttal. Trump, of course, went on behaving in his erratic, inexplicable manner. As he left the summit, he interrupted the Chancellor while she was addressing her fellow nato leaders, and kissed her. “I love this woman,” he said. “Isn’t she great?” A senior German official who told me about that particular Trumpian flourish resisted any attempt at full understanding. “It’s up to psychologists and historians what to make of that,” he said. Four days later, Trump ended his European tour in Helsinki. There, standing next to Vladimir Putin, he spoke with bewildering sympathy for Russian foreign policy, ill-concealed contempt for his nato partners, and implausible skepticism about his own intelligence services.\n\nSo Trump didn’t help our trade deficits with the EU, and NATO spending had been steadily increasing prior to his taking office. He verbally assaulted our allies and demeaned the NATO organization, causing it to lose stature and be seen as faltering or weak.\n\nHe didn’t care about Nord Stream, he cared about pissing Merkel off and he used their energy independence as a pretext for doing that. His sanction of a small Swiss firm who was working on a tiny fraction of the pipeline did nothing to stop the project. \n\nHis rantings were counter-productive and ineffectual, unless you’re a Russian. When you look back over Trump’s record on NATO, knowing what we do about Putin’s obesssive hatred for the alliance, his actions seem decidedly traitorous.",

Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.\nRussia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome.

Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin holds an operational meeting with permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation - RIA Novosti, 1920, 25.02.2022” source: https://web-archive-org.translate.goog/web/20220226051154/https://ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp",

Finland's section reads:\n\n\"Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be \"donated to Murmansk Oblast\".\"\n\nFinland will be next after this Ukraine crisis. At the section for Ukraine it reads:\n\n\"Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because \"Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics\". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.\"\n\nTheir plan for the US is to:\n\n\"fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke \"Afro-American racists\". Russia should \"introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S.\"\n\nThink about [\"Russian troll farms\"] (https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/.../troll-farms-and-fake-news...) that continually stir things up on different social media platforms to get us, the American people, to be at each other's throats over such trivial things. Think about what it says for the UK:\n\n\"The United Kingdom, merely described as an \"extraterritorial floating base of the U.S.\", should be cut off from Europe.\"\n\nand then think about how more research is coming out to show that [Russian troll farms played a part in the Brexit vote as well] (https://www.npr.org/2019/01/19/686830510/senate-finds-russian-bots-bucks-helped-push-brexit-vote-through). People treat them like \"trolls\" & not foreign digital attacks on the people of other nations aiming to cause instability.\n\nThis needs to be a wake up call. This is Putin's game plan for the world. MAKE NO MISTAKE, it isn't the Russian citizens who want this. It's the Russian elites, it's Putin & his oligarchs who want this. And they won't stop with Ukraine. It's just one step in their plan.",

Stoking conflict between Russia separatists and Nationalist Ukrainians. Do I like the war? hell no, but I am not going to jump up and down parroting the propaganda of either country for getting us in this damn mess. The US (and NATO) has been fomenting conflict in the region and trying to install politicians in office that are favorable to the west, and Putin has been doing the same thing. Only now do we find out, almost by accident, that The west has been cooking biological agents in the Ukraine. We are not the innocents in this skirmish. The only innocents are the people of the Ukraine and Russia. People buy into the hate and propaganda too soon. I am disgusted that biden is pushing to punish the Russian people. They don’t deserve putin, but the people also don’t deserve their financial ruin. Now I find out the WH has been updating TikTok stars about the conflict so it reaches your 1/ year olds at home. Desperate. The west has been stoking conflict for their own benefit, the Russians have been fighting for territory and resources so they strategically choke off Europe and the globalists are playing god.",
