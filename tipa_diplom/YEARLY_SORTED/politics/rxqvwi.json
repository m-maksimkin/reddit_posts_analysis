Ever.\n\nThe house set the crime of not wearing a mask to $5,000 as a fine. MGT made 2000x that in state and federal fund raising campaigns, so she just kept violating the rule and gave zero fucks about racking up fines even when she racked up to 100k in fines. When the fine is less than the severity of the crime, there's zero reason anyone would give a damn.\n\nThis is playing out with the insurrection situation. Some woman took part in the insurrection, was arrested and jailed, but then released out on bail. She then proceeded to kill someone while out on bail.\n\nTreason against country was allowed by letting the criminal out on bail and now an innocent unrelated to the original crime is dead because of such common disregard for the severity of the crime.",

One of the most disturbing things about Trump's presidency was the fact that it turned out all the ethics rules were just suggestions.  When a president came along who just thumbed his nose at anti-corruption rules and literally did business with the federal government while simultaneously running it, **nothing happened to him**.

We have a new Congressman in my district and he has to share a D.C.-area apartment with a bunch of other Representatives just so he can afford rent in two HCLAs. Representatives make $174k according to Wikipedia; for reference, that’s less than the average municipal department director in my hometown and about $50k less than our city manager, and even that salary is barely enough to qualify for a mortgage on the median-value home in our city. I get why our federal-level electeds want to try to make money on the side. And I know there are probably per diems and various travel/other allowances, which I haven’t researched.\n\nBut, I also believe our elected officials need to be impartial, and stock trading seems to compromise that unless it’s restricted to index funds.\n\nMaybe the answer is to compensate them better overall, and also figure in the expense of maintaining their required residence in their home jurisdiction. Spend 1% less on the military budget and give it to our fed-level electeds, possibly. Not extravagant salaries, but enough that they can live comfortably in D.C. and back home, and also save well for retirement and a nice buffer for if they’re defeated and have to transition back into another career back home before retirement. That would cut down on the temptation to do weird gritting in the hope of a future consultant gig.\n\nI like the idea of compensating them well enough that they can just represent us and govern according to their platforms and personal ethics.",

What we need is campaign finance reform, and a complete block on any form of compensation. Stocks are a fine first baby step, but most of the time it doesn't matter because politicians get golden parachute do nothing job offers from companies they allow to dictate policy.

One broader solution for instance, once you've been elected to office.

But we know had she had truly had them turn on her she wouldn’t of came out of prison now making  more money on her brand, deals, etc…then before she got locked up.  Since as of now until the swamp gets drained of all these old old politicians, government employees the best thing to do is find the Pelosi’s, The Biden’s, the Bush’s, the Clinton’s stock files and invest in the same companies as they do and if you see them selling a lot of a certain stock or buying one of a certain stock follow suit!! (Not final advice just play their game with them!!) I think the problem is term limits!! The POTUS only gets 4 years possibly 8 which as POTUS to truly get permanent fixes to real world issues that position should be minimum 6 and 6 years we have ways to get bad POTUS’s out of office if we the American people feel they are corrupted and not putting Americans citizens, our military people and our country first before any of their rich friends, etc..and then positions that have no limits should have 4 year terms, etc…I’m sorry but we shouldn’t have Pelosis’s of the world running the show for so many years to the point they mentally aren’t sharp like they were 20 years ago In their prime! We could still use their knowledge, MAYBE BECAUSE THEY ARE DINOSAURS NOW FAYS BECAUSE WITH TECHNOLOGY THE WORLD IS MOVING WAY FASTER THEN IT USED TO but none of them should be at the top of their fields! We have so many bright 30-40 year old people who could be fixing all the issues these groups of names that have been in our government for so many years have screwed up over and over because of their Pride, their greed, them putting themselves and their little group of friends in front of our country over and over!! Also they need to stop with the rules for thee not for me stuff!!!! They Literally shut the world down, acted dumb told everyone the POTUS at the time was lying about everything from where the virus came from, that the election was stolen, that Russia did it, wasted millions of tax dollars trying to pay enough people to make up a rumor and have it stick which btw was our tax money that could have gone to much better things!! They were acting like our white house/Americas government was a high school and not one of the most powerful places on earth!! America truly needs a huge reset and we need a way to honor our Declaration of Independence and remember we as citizens are supposed to be able to get rid of a tyrannical government and I truly feel we are there!! There are a lot of good politicians and people in government but I feel there are more bad then good and it’s the old group of the same names in the same circles that feel like America is theirs, we are the peasants they toss some stimulus checks too, every single election they divide the country with race, terrorism, stock market crashes, bubbles, it’s always trying to instill fear into Americas Citizens to get a vote!! Make empty promises over and over and over and over and over seriously reminds me when I was in high school this girl promised to get pop machines into the cafeteria if we voted for her she won and we never got a pop machine!! Just like real presidents of today!! SORRY for the long rant I’ve been holding all my feeling towards stocks, inside trading especially Pelosi’s husband account grabbing every single stock for cheap right before the government announced they were backing it and they just make millions upon millions and that’s just one dirty politician now times that by them all because they are all greedy, liars, who only care about power to control the citizens that are sheep and comply with everything they are told and in return we now have a country full of Karens!!! Have you noticed people that will record any and I mean anything they think will get them views on their Facebook page, or their tik tok purposely now look for arguments to record or someone just having a bad day ends up viral for literally nothing just arguing with another person and it goes viral because Kevin or Karen start it but don’t start recording until they get the reaction they want and then hit record and play innocent so now days video is t even real enough to tell the truth!! Seriously AMERICA NEEDS A RESET WITH POLITICIANS WHO DO INSIDE TRADING, BEEN IN POLITICS TO LONG, THWY NEED TO GET REMOVED AND WE NEED THE YOUNGER 30-50 YEAR OLDS IN POWER AND THE 20-30 YEAR OLDS ON STANDBY TO TAKE OVER AND HAVE THE OLDER PEOPLE TO ADVISE AGAIN SORRY FOR THE RANT JUST LOVE MY COUNTRY AND RIGHT NOW I DONT RECOGNIZE MY COUNTRY!!
