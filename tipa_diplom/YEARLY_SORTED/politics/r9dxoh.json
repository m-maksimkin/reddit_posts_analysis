Even if they're not up to speed on modern-day, that's why they have advisors and staff. Almost none of these people are scientists, or climate experts, or (insert specialization here). They are supposed to get this info from their team and experts. But money talks louder than education to them.\n\nBeing wealthy makes them out of touch. Lacking empathy makes them out of touch. Having their seat entrenched makes them out of touch (see: term limits here). Money in politics makes them out of touch.\n\nIf you think it's age, you're just setting yourself up to have a younger crop of assholes to fleece you. \n\nLet's fix the real issues.

It's unique to the individual, and it's determined by technological progress. If we are able to develop treatment plans that stave off senility for a few more decades, then how do we adjust law to reflect that? \n\nThe first issue is also subjective, and legislating on it is nigh on impossible. How do you measure that? How do you justify the age you've chosen? How do you adjust it in the future as knowledge spreads quicker through the internet, and this issue becomes potentially obsolete? Hell, you might as well ban rich people from the government because they're out of touch with the issues the average American faces, you'll come across the same issues. \n\nJust about all the other problems people have with old people in the government could be better addressed by term limits and restricting campaign financing.

How about taking money from churches that don't pay taxes but the pastor has a 5 bedroom house,  4 cars,  one of them is over 50k.

How will a 70yo guy ever understand what a 15yo is going through right now? Old people make laws for old people first, then the others second (not 100% of the time, but way too often). And why wouldn't they do what benefits them? Sure, they have more experience, but this isn't 1500 anymore where progress is so slow that experience outweighs \"updated knowledge\". Now, you always have to balance experience vs. being up-to-date on the world and its issues.",

Here's what I think will eventually occur over the next two years. A non-Trump Republican will come forward in the event of Trump running. Remember his most vocal, loyal ground roots supporters, the rally followers, are least likely to actually vote. This moderate Republican could challenge Trump in the primaries, or set up a 3rd party.  Ben Sasse and Rob Portman attractive, moderate Republicans come to mind. Sasse or Portman would find support from moderate Republicans and moderate Democrats. I'm not able to read the numbers, but I would suggest the moderates of both parties could pull 40 to 45% of the vote. The time is right to begin to accept a political system of 3 or more parties made up of  Extreme Left, Extreme Right, Moderate. We need the ability on the national level to negotiate a working majority of fewer than 50% as it is today. Otherwise, we are stuck with a Legislative Branch that is powerless with an Executive and Judicial branches that just totally out of sequence.",
