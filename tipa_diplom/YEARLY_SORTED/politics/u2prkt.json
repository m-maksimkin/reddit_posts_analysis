I know everyone loves the idea of the IRS taking taxes from the mega rich to give to the poor but the IRS doesn’t want to go against people that can afford to fight back and the mega rich will always be finding the holes in the system as fast as they can be patched. The IRS will always go after the poor because they are easy pickings. We already pay taxes on income and purchases. It seems like there is a way to just collect taxes in that way and no need annual reports and shit. It seems like the only way money is not being taxed is in rare situations like a businesses profit. I am confident the majority of businesses are not just squirreling millions of dollars away to never be used, as soon as they are used they have to pay taxes on it and that money they made was taxed when they customers made it abs taxed when they spent it, how many times is taxes paid on ant given dollar printed? Make taxes simple ffs and dump annual reports that just favor the rich. Who cares if peole squirrel away a ton of money so long as they are taxed when they eventually spend it?",

It's much more profitable to be a tax attorney than a tax collector.  \n  \nFor decades now the Republican party has been bleeding the IRS dry, and Democrats haven't been able to stop the bleeding.  Make no mistake, Republicans haven't just been cutting taxes, they've also been firing the tax collectors.  \n  \nWhat this means is that the IRS doesn't have the resources, ability, or manpower to audit the wealthy, who can afford $500/hr tax lawyers, shell corporations, and offshore bank accounts; the IRS only has the resources to get the poor schmucks who transposed a digit in their regular tax filings.  \n  \nBy way of analogy: The IRS goes after the low hanging fruit because they can't reach the higher boughs, we've given them a step stool when they really need a fire ladder. \n  \nUnfortunately funding the IRS isn't super popular among the electorate.  \n  \nIf you asked the average American voter \"Would you rather fund the IRS or public education?\"  They'd probably choose public education.  \n  \n\nIf you asked the average American voter \"Would you rather fund the IRS or national security?\"  They'd probably choose national security.  \n  \n\nIf you asked the average American voter \"Would you rather fund the IRS or public health care?\"  They'd probably choose public health care.  \n  \nNow you and I know that funding the IRS would result in a strong positive return on investment, the additional tax revenues we'd collect would far outstrip the revenues we'd spend getting the IRS up to speed... but the average American voter doesn't know that, they just know that the IRS takes XX% out of their paycheck.  \n  \nThis is a real problem with discernible causes and *comparatively* easy solutions, we just need put an end to the modern variety of [Starve the Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast) Republicanism.

When the Covid Relief Act was passed, the relief amount couldn’t be $2000 but the gig worker reporting requirement was dropped to $600.  Granted, these are people who Uber and bartend and make a few grand a year and ARE NOT  reporting it. But is it prudent ti wag a finger at them and say “tsk tsk you should be paying your taxes!” When the rich don’t pay and don’t get audited? \n\nThey are the working poor. They are 28 year olds to 35 year olds living in a shady part of town paying $1500/month in rent and driving a 10 year old Honda. They are semi broke. And the IRS will more likely audit them than Bezos. So they get mad to learn the first and most significant act passed by Dems couldn’t even match Trump’s number but it could put them in the bullseye for tax enforcement. Optics. The “Pay your taxes” argument doesn’t play well as a message when voters see the rich get away with not paying taxes and the poor are being told “well if you just paid your taxes you wouldn’t have to worry about that $600 reporting requirement.” Why are they being targeted when the wealthy are not? \n\nThe righteous Redditors who vote blue no matter who will down vote this comment. \n\nBut, I’m NOT saying vote R. I’ll be voting straight D this November.   \n\nWhat I AM saying is that the Democrats need to stop passing laws that strengthen the IRS’ ability to go after gig workers and start fighting for voting rights and worker rights and prosecuting employers who commit wage theft, fight police corruption, pass tax breaks for the working poor and middle class, and take a break from arguing that the IRS needs more funding. Because the IRS is absolutely targeting the poor despite the claim that more funding will help them target the rich. Nobody believes that. \n\nAnd why should they? Making the payment processors report all accounts that cross the $600 threshold WILL net more tax revenue for the IRS - from the working poor and middle class, to be spent at the Pentagon and on corporate welfare. \n\nGreat optics. /s\n\nThat’s my point. Vote for the Democrats who will change that paradigm. Because these Corporatist Dems are destroying the morale of the very voter base needed to unseat the Republicans.\n\nEdit: the gatekeepers are butthurt! Fuck the Corporate Right Wing of the Democrats. We can get a gist of this sub by seeing how many people are pissed off.  But it is true that the first major legislation the Conservadems passed was to lower the reporting threshold to $600.  Wasted zero time doing that. Passed in March 2021.  Could not pass Voting Rights Act or Build Back Better but sure could pass the $600 threshold.",

Tax laws that allow them to pass income through S-Corporations and take large expenses that may not really be expenses as well as new depreciation laws enacted in 2017 mean that, while a person may have very low income on paper, they may actually be making a lot of money. This is only a very small number of ways a person can appear to have far less income than they actually had. Think of how Amazon avoided paying income taxes by reinvesting their money into growing segments at a loss. What they report to the IRS may not be what they actually earned, this is the entire reason you audit.\n\nI’m a democrat, but honestly this outrage just shows a fundamental misunderstanding of our tax system by Democrats.",

            "text": "I volunteer to do taxes for mid to low income earners in low income communities, and I can honestly understand why these audits have increased among lowest earners. Reasons are pretty simple: much of the new tax provisions during the pandemic concentrate relief among low earners. Two main examples: the earned income tax credit, usually a huge relief to low income people, has been tripled. The EIC is only available to people earning around 40k or less, and it tapers off, depending on how many children you have, between roughly 15k to roughly 35k. The child tax credit has been massively increased, and this is not available to high income earners either. All in all, these refundable credits have 2-3x’d in the last year. \n\nThat has lead to rampant fraud. Yes, there is rote tax fraud among the taxpayers themselves, but there is also fraud which targets the taxpayers. I have seen, so many times this year, instances where someone will “prepare” someone’s taxes, then put the return into their own bank account, the disappear. My taxpayers tell me the stories. The incentive to defraud low income earners has increased as much as the returns have. \n\nI know audit usually means making sure someone is paying what they owe, but I would guess it also means verifying the identity of the taxpayer—a process in which the IRS would learn if the return was fraudulent. If this is the case, the increased audits would definitely help many of the taxpayers I have had throughout the year who have had their returns stolen in previous years. Increased audits don’t necessarily mean increased tax burden. People seem to be conflating the two, but if the question is whether the last year has increased the tax burden on low income earners the answer is emphatically no.\n\nEdit: Also, one thing this article strategically left out is that after the 200k-1M income band, the rate of audits increases greatly. \n\nSome context when talking about the tax burden of the poor: the average tax return I prepare for low income earners is around $2000. It is not uncommon to see $15,000 returns if the taxpayer has children. And it is rare that a taxpayer making less than 30k without children will owe. Really the only scenario where they owe is if they have the “Married Filing Separately” filing status, which renders you ineligible for most credits.",

The \"audit\" is simply a request for documentation (by mail) to substantiate what the person put on their return for that particular item. You get a letter saying \"You put down X but it should be Y and this means you owe us Z. If you disagree please explain why using the attached form.\"\n\nDetecting these discrepancies is entirely automatic (software sees that X doesn't match Y and flags it for audit). These are probably hitting poor people more often because poor people are less likely to use professional tax preparers that wouldn't be making these mistakes in the first place. I bet a ton of this is related to stimulus payments and unemployment insurance.",

That doesn't mean they actually MADE 25k - that's what they filed on.\n\nIf anyone knows what it costs to live (they have charts of every county in the US with average minimum 'standard' living expenses) -it's the IRS. filing a tax return on 25k that kicks you a GIANT refund due to the EITC is going to get scrutinized\n\n25k  Not a lot to work with. Especially if you have kids.\n\nerrors of any substance are more easily seen , verified and corrected. A lot of it falls under 'fake businesses' or other losses to offset W2 income and EITC fraud.\n\nIn many cases, the IRS gets to the filer via the corrupt tax preparer. They have an ID number that goes down on the form too and if the IRS catches more than a few random errors of an egregious nature - they pull all the paper that preparer has ever touched.\n\nIn fact, if you have any concerns about the person doing your taxes, (if they are a freelancer be especially careful - the guy sitting at the end of the bar doing returns in between scotches is almost ALWAYS **no bueno**) -  look at the back of the return at the bottom. If it does not have their NAME AND PTIN (Preparer Tax Identification Number) ON IT, and/or it says SELF PREPARED that's a BIG FLAG.\n\nIt means they have zero confidence in the return - or it may mean they do not have credentials.\n\nIf you walk into a low rent shop in the ghetto with YUGE SIGNS in the window - WE WILL GET YOU UP TO 10k TODAY! and they sit down and start filling out a schedule C (profit and loss from business) and you work a regular J-O-B as a WAGE EARNER - do yourself a favor - get up and leave.\n\nThey are scamming, you will (most likely) get caught (especially first time filers - they are the most likely to get checked) and while the IRS is more focused on building a case against the tax preparer (who can and will go to jail if they keep it up) they can make you miserable as well + they can kick you out from applying for the EITC for 10 years if they deem it a fraudulent filing and the money you received will have to be repaid. The penalties will roughly double what you owe and the compound daily interest will make you regret it. You got a $7500 refund which you blew taking the kids to Disney and a shopping spree? Now you owe 15k and they want $500 a month which will take you about 4 years to pay back.",
