In fact, so well that he got a 1000% return on his investment for Fox News.\n\nBut at the heart of the matter is a very important economic question that this, and recent past, administrations should be tackling which is: \"What actions are you going to take to reduce inflation?\" or \"Do you think that the inflation that will result from your current plans to increase spending and the national debt is a wise choice for the economic health of our nation?\", \"How will your administration deal with the increased inflation that will result from that spending?\"\n\nNo, sorry, there's a ton of questions/answers that SHOULD absolutely be being discussed surrounding the unchecked spending that has been taking place for the past 16 years and the significant increase in inflation that has occurred in the past 18 months. We've been able to avoid increased inflation in the face of unchecked government spending due to an incredibly strong economy/GDP for the past decade. The strength of that economy was challenged and went tits up due to Covid. Now you will be seeing the inflationary consequences of that spending and it will be significant and all economic sectors and demographics and may be extremely difficult to mitigate or reduce.\n\nDoocy may have the job because of nepotism, and he may be woefully underqualified for the job compared to those that should have it but:\n\n1. At the heart of the question is a very important political and economic issue that should be being discussed by the citizens and the politicians rather than being ignored and treated as a whimsical fantasy where debt has no consequences, and\n2. No matter what, that was an insanely unprofessional and unpresidential response whether or not it was intended to be heard. And he's an idiot for not censoring himself instead of even having a remote chance such a thought could become public and give the republicans absolutely everything they need to wipe his party of the board come mid-term elections.\n3. It would have been easy to respond: \"Increased inflation is obviously not a positive economic trend and it is an important issue for my administration. Thank you, next question.\"",

How the hell can we keep making legislation regarding minimum wages, when we do absolutely nothing about rising consumer prices, rising cost of housing (afterall remember, most landlords charge 30% of the areas average income. So increased wages=increased cost of living, and that’s a widely followed “rule”.).\n\nThis entire r/politics forum just baffles me; how can literally all of you defend ANY party, or ANY president when in just the past 10 years we’ve seen absolutely no changes. Increased minimum wage? Increased cost of living.  That’s what I’ve seen and it’s not stopping\n\nPs. I live in New York. I love alot of our policies. But we have some of the highest minimum wages and also some of the highest costs of living. The only reason people around me can pay rent is because the local area is so poor and rent reflects that. But we’re stuck. Make too much money we lose our benefits and have to pay for all the things we didn’t have to pay for, punishing us for making more money. Make too little and you can’t afford the price of living. It’s not working. We need legislation that attacks cost of living. Not income. We need to tackle people losing health insurance and being afraid to reach “middle class status” because they’ll lose their benefits.\n\nAnyhow. Rant over. Biden sucks. The only reason he got angry, would be because he like all the other politicians, know for a FACT we are suffering terrible costs of living, and doesn’t want to face up to the fact the Democratic Party doesn’t have a solution, nor do the republicans.

DJT hid behind his computer screen to dish out insults left, right and center more than 100 times a day! Now he hides behind his telephone interviews, and his terribly worded statements… He got away with everything for so long! Not only did he get away with it, he was applauded for it by some media platforms.  President Biden says it ONCE, and all the DJT and GOP supporters complain the media is not going hard enough on him?? Please, you make me laugh!
