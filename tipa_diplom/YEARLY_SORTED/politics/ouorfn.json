The delay is on Congress. They have been reviewing, under law, Trump's tax refund. Yup. That's correct. Various members of Congress on for both the Dems and the Republicans have seen Trump's taxes, possibly all of them, for the last 10 years. Crazy to hear that huh? \n\nThere is this law created back in the 1920s that established the [United States Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congressional_Joint_Committee_on_Taxation) and that law means Congress is required to review any tax refund over $2,000,000 (was $75k back in the previous 20's).\n\nTake a quick read/listen ([Transcript and 3 min clip](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/02/919411676/congressional-committee-has-been-reviewing-trump-tax-refund-for-nine-years))  \n\n> every large federal income tax refund has to be reviewed by a little-known congressional committee. According to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html), that includes President Trump's $73 million tax refund, which has been under review by this committee for nine years now.\n\nThis is the audit Trump is talking about. It's not the IRS. It's Congress reviewing his taxes. \n\n> NOREN: Typically, the joint committee clears refund reviews in about three weeks, maybe a little bit more than three weeks, in a standard, run-of-the-mill case.  \n\n> GOLDSTEIN: Some really complicated cases might take a few months to figure out, but the president's case is still unresolved.\n\n\n[Full podcast 21 min listen](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/30/918894535/trumps-tiny-taxes) - NPR: Trump's Tiny Taxes\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the NYTs reporting on Trump's Taxes (same link as above) [Trump's Taxes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html)\n\nNYTs reporting on Trump's taxes even said this and everyone missed it.\n\n> Refunds require the approval of I.R.S. auditors and an opinion of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, a bipartisan panel better known for reviewing the impact of tax legislation. Tax law requires the committee to weigh in on all refunds larger than $2 million to individuals.\n> \n> **Records show that the results of an audit of Mr. Trump’s refund were sent to the joint committee in the spring of 2011. An agreement was reached in late 2014, the documents indicate, but the audit resumed and grew to include Mr. Trump’s returns for 2010 through 2013. In the spring of 2016, with Mr. Trump closing in on the Republican nomination, the case was sent back to the committee. It has remained there, unresolved, with the statute of limitations repeatedly pushed forward.**",

Freedom comes with responsibility. \n\nNo victims need to apply no People who think they are entitled need to apply please don't whine.  \n\nWe the people understand that freedom comes with responsibility when we decided most of us decided to leave a tribal society and join together for the common good we've it's good we agreed that under certain circumstances in circumstances we would submit regardless regardless of how we felt personally we it's out personally we would submit to the business of keeping our fellow Americans alive.\n\nIs who information is coming out about Boston it's Boston and the smallpox epidemic of 19 0 1 and what was said then and what the Supreme Court of the United States of America said then.\n\nIs Al we are a nation of angry victims and those victims are being bled dry is in blood dry by grifters. But they just don't get it and I no longer care if they get it or not.\n\nI don't mind watching hundreds of thousands of backward ignorant jerk's die it doesn't bother me one bit.
