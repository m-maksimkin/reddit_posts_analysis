I was paying way above minimum wage, I would pick them up and drop them off from their homes, regularly buy them lunch, give them advances on pay if they needed it, completely flexible with their schedules, didnt put all the bullshot hard work on them, actually taught them and trained them and encouraged them to use their experience to get better jobs in the future AND IT DIDNT FUCKING MATTER AT ALL. Whenever I turned my back they just wouldnt do their job, they would get high in my trucks and dent them, ruined my trailers and Toro riding lawnmowers and just didnt appreciate anything I did for them. All they wanted was more money and less work to do but good hours at the same time? I cycled through like a dozen employees before I realized that I just cant trust anyone and decided to sell off my spare equipment and focus on quality over quantity with one truck and one trailer, so I can always be there. I try to look back and reflect on what I could've been doing wrong but it just isnt there.. I was nothing but patient, fair, and understanding and just got taken advantage of over and over again.",

The actual term that they use is \"food insecurity\", which is massively different than starvation or hunger, feel free to go argue with people in 3rd world nations who are actually starving otherwise. The lower and middle class of America are actually suffering from an obesity epidemic.\n\nSecond, nearly every corporation that pays minimum wages operates in markets that are highly competitive and offer low cost goods.  As a result, they operate on razor thin margins.  Any increase in labor costs has to be accounted for by either a decrease in manpower (through automation or overwork), a decrease in benefits, r a decrease in supply costs (ie using lower grade goods), or an increase in costs of services/goods.\n\nThe most sensible method in most markets to make up the difference is an increase in the cost of services/goods or a decrease in benefits, which is then propagated to the consumer who then has to pay more for all their everyday goods and services, thus negating a portion of their increased pay.\n\nAnd then you run into housing, whose pricing is dictated entirely by supply and demand.  Since you are neither decreasing demand nor increasing supply, all your are doing is setting a new normal for the amount of income all individuals in the lowest bracket can afford to pay for rent.  Rent will go up, and the person that was making $12 an hour who is now making $16 dollars an hour will have no more disposable income than he had when the whole thing started.\n\nThe whole argument is grossly flawed on nearly every level.  It has no rational or logical base.  The end result is that in 5 years you'll just be calling for another wage hike and nothing actually changes.  If you want to actually benefit people in the lower wage brackets, the easiest way to to incentivize the development of cheap housing through lower regulation and various other incentives, thus drastically increasing low income housing supply (and as a happy side effect, increasing construction job opportunities).   This is why it's so much easier to live on so-called \"starvation wages\" in the Midwest as opposed to the coastal regions.",

            "text": "Good afternoon Reddit world,\n\nIts easy to point fingers because there is no accountability in the process unless one points the finger back at themselves.  I am an American Business Owner.  I currently employee 326 people and the starting wage for my company is 15.00.  I believe that if you cannot pay someone a living wage to do a job, you should do it yourself until you can afford to do it.  However, I do believe this is a choice.  The Govt should not be mandating a minimum wage because the Govt doesn't hold up its end of the bargain in supplying a work force that is educated enough to earn 15.00 an hour... Hey thats not nice, your calling us dumb...\n\nNo, I am saying as a land owning tax payer, I support public schools, and the level of preparedness our schools ready our future work force is extremely subpar.  Doesn't matter where they come from, disenfranchised urban, rural or middle class neighborhoods.  American schools got it wrong.  Our schools teach a general education standard which was necessary when we as a country were developing through the industrial age.  Now, we are supposed to be a 1st world leader and our schools never got the memo... OK, I'm listening....\n\nYou see when I was in Highschool 21 years ago, I was taking a senior year English Class and we were learning about Baowolf and Chaucers Canterbury Tales.  Would you believe in my professional career I have never used any of what was taught in that class.  Yet it was a standard Gen Ed class that in the curriculum path I was a part of, I had to take.  This is just one example of the giant waste of time we spend in our schools pushing the agenda of general education rather than problem solving for practical application. Nothing against those that want to be a literary scholar or a teacher or a writer, the class would be applicable for those professions, but not as a general study.  We are not making a well rounded society as what was originally pushed as the agenda.  We are putting forth people who accept mediocrity and allow excuses to be the basis for their failures... Ouch, ok that hurt, but I get it.  The truth hurts.  Well what would you do differently smarty pants?\n\nGlad you asked, while I believe a public school system is one of the most important staples in a civilized society, I would restructure the focus to a more tailored approach to skills for practical use and refine as we move through middle school and high school.  Elementary school would be K - 5 and teach general education and supplement with electives.  Then in middle school start to target the aptitude of the child and direct them towards their strengths and supplement their weakness with supplementary classes to ensure they maintain a basic standard of reading and writing.  Then in high school tailor the program based on the direction they are testing towards.  By no means do we restrict access to English or Math classes, but they should become the elective if the child isn't demonstrating an aptitude towards those subjects.  We need to look at society and how money is made and structure classes to facilitate a direction towards understanding and capitalizing on those areas.  We need to have experts in all fields compensated for their knowledge and encouraged to share that knowledge in an environment created for learning.  \n\nThe biggest glaring problem that supports we are not doing this is our higher education system and how teachers are educated and trained to teach.  It is mind blowing preposterous.  Sorry teachers, but in a school of 100 teachers, maybe, and I mean maybe 5 are half way decent.  1. You don't engage the kids to want to participate.  If you teach a subject that people are made to take, here is a hint, most likely the majority of the class doesn't want to be there.  So, they are not going to learn until their attention can be captivated.  So, you have to learn how to engage a classroom.  2. You don't demonstrate practical application in how this will be used in their life in the immediate future or how it can be useful monetarily in their life now or in the immediate future.  This doesn't mean what your teaching isn't necessary, but if you want people to enjoy learning it, give them a reason they can identify with and get excited about how to apply it in their life now. 3. You are not connecting in a way they empathize with the importance of the lesson.  \n\nI am currently developing an Apprenticeship to be recognized as a Federally Registered Apprenticeship Program for my business in Mortgage Banking.  Most of my Operations Staff I trained myself and taught them how to do every job in the business.  My experience in training people comes from all walks of life, White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and from all income backgrounds.  Many of my managers have never been in management, but were taught how to lead by me and the first lesson in my leadership class, Accountability.  You cannot hold another person accountable until you look inward and hold yourself accountable first.  Many of my managers do not have college degrees and perform ad good or better than the ones that do.  Why is this?  Because we are all capable of learning and performing to a standard, but the people teaching it have to work hard to understand how their student learns, get them engaged, teach them the practical application of the why and demonstrate situations in where they can apply the lesson in their day to day to demonstrate empathy to correlations they can understand.  Our apprenticeship is designed to do this and once approved will be taking it on the road as a model for other industries to develop their version to help bring appropriate education and training to our future generations of American Workers.  \n\nIn MD where I live and went to college, we have a very rigid standard for a person to become a teacher.  Based on the number of credits, it takes 138 credits or did.  That is almost 5 years worth of classes.  There are 2 testing components called the praxis 1 and praxis 2.  Each component has prerequisite classes that must be taken before the testing component can be taken.  The prereqs are not offered every semester, so if one is available in the fall only and you don't realize this early enough on, guess what you are waiting to the following year to take the class.  This by default causes many college students to have to go to college for 5 to 6 years to become a teacher!!!  MD realized the ridiculousness of this when I was in school and created a masters program to help calm the burn a little bit when they realized many of their teachers were taking more than 4 years by default to graduate.  So that is nice but still not enough to warrant the amount of school compared to the pay.  \n\nBachelors in Math with Education cert leads to 48k in starting salary, 60k with the masters in education.  While the avg student loan debt for the 6 years to get the degree from a mid level university will run you 80 to 90k all in for tuition, room and board and books.  Why would anyone pay that much for a profession that will take 20 years to get to a standard to pay it off.  MD realized this and started to forgive education loans for teachers.  Problem is, noone has taught them how to engage kids so many get placed in troubled schools with high turnover and have to learn how to really do the job on the fly.  Maybe if they are lucky.  But in reality, it doesn't need to be that complicated.  Mark Zuckerberg never graduated from college (I know he has an honorary degree) so by this standard, he will not be allowed to teach computer programming in a MD Highschool if he wanted. But he is a billionaire who has taught others what he knows who in return became millionaires.  Yet most MD schools probably have a computer programming class and the teacher teaching it probably makes a salary of 60 to 70k.  My point isn't to disparage the Computer Teacher, but the fact that someone with a proven track record of success is not able to be a teacher because of how the rules are made very arbitrarily.  And yes I use that word purposefully.  It is arbitrary because while they may make an exception for Mark Z because of his status, their standards are arbitrary because they are not based on true results.  If they were based on real results,, then the employers of America would not be looking at a major deficiency in entry level worker skills that we are.  \n\nReal results would demonstrate a working class that is able to compete for entry level jobs that is ready and educated out of highschool.  The level of preparedness has steadily declined every generation since the Boomers.  So, IMO these teaching standards that produce such quality educators instead of industry leaders is a giant contributor in the void of practical application of the subject they are attempting to teach.  I know, why would Mark Z teach when he makes billions, maybe its a bad example, because most likely he wouldn't in a formal classroom.  However, maybe there is a 14 year old who can hack bank security or some other crazy feat just for giggles.  Society will punish this kid and then the FBI or NSA will employ him.  But maybe that Kid would be able to teach his peers how he does what he does (w/o the nefarious aspects).  Kids speak the same language and are generally into the same things.  So, why not have the ones that are clearly leaps and bounds ahead in the knowledge of useful skills have a crack at teaching other kids the things that they know and can use practically in their life and maybe make some money at it in the process.",

Tying the top earner to the bottom earner on a multiplier within a company, free education for anyone who doesn’t make above a living wage, hard capping the amount of hours you can work in a week, mandatory vacation minimum amounts.  All would change the supply and demand curve creating increased salaries.\n\nYou also could push the cost of living down through policies like requiring builders to make low,medium, and high income housing at a certain ratio to help the community address housing issues.  You could also do the same for transportation and health care which are large contributors to the cost of living.\n\nAnother thing that should be done is that the minimum wage should be set at a much more granular level.  National $15 makes no sense.  It’s not nearly enough for places like NYC where the cost of living is as much as 87% higher than the national average and it’s likely too much for rural cities that can be as much as 50% of the cost of living in the area.

That said, it is a community priority and expecting the burden to be carried completely by \"greedy\" business owners rather than the community as a whole is misguided. Here is an example of why:\n\nI can't speak to every industry, but I am very familiar with the restaurant industry as both low wage worker and manager. The average restaurant has about a 5% profit margin with top performers hitting about 10%. Bear in mind that some are making less and many are losing money. Labor is typically 25-30% of sales. The balance goes to food cost, rent, utilities, insurance, payroll taxes (which benefit workers), and other minor costs. This is all before income taxes. If every cent of that 5-10% profit went to pay increases, the $7.25 worker would make between $8.46 and $10.15 an hour. The solution for those restaurants to stay in business and raise wages to say $15 an hour is to raise per worker productivity to $15 per person hour plus some reasonable profit. (5% doesn't seem \"greedy\" to me.) There are ways that can happen, but pretending they have no other consequences like reduced competition, higher prices, higher expectations of workers, and more automation is unrealistic.",

Not to say it’s bad to reduce turnover or increase retention, but if doing so is at the cost of skilled labor, then it is not efficient. \n\nSecondly, this approach doesn’t take inflation into account at all. If the living wage is all of a sudden double what it is now, this will create a cost-push inflation scenario, having a direct correlation with the value of the dollar. There are of course many other factors that influence inflation and the value of money, but raising wages across the board for menial jobs would not have a positive effect on the macroeconomic side. \n\nThird and finally, how does this take care of the business? This type of policy penalizes the employer at all levels. Of course McDonald’s could “afford” to pay a higher wage, but the employees do not carry risk. \n\nLet me explain further. Why does the CEO of McDonald’s make money as well as the individual franchise owners? They make more money because they carry the risk. If the business fails, you may be out of a job, but they will be in the tank financially and lose their investment. It is the same reason that large shareholders make money and don’t even work for the actual company. They carry risk, and thus they reap rewards. \n\nIf you have the knowledge of flipping burgers or frying potatoes, then you do not have very much specialized knowledge. To increase your wage, you should naturally increase your skill set, or develop a skill set altogether. Instead of focusing on getting paid more to flip a “damn burger”, maybe learn how to be a carpenter, or go into a field that pays more. There is a huge demand for restaurant servers and cooks, as well as manual labor jobs, all of which pay much better.",

I’m not saying $600 is a lot but it’s twice as much as this article is claiming. You also have to look at it this way, if you’re being paid $18.75/hr and working 40 hr weeks, you will make (before taxes) $750/week. I live in a rural area where $18.75 is a pretty decent wage. From the employee’s perspective there is a cost benefit analysis, it’s not exactly “if I work this job for 40hr / week then I’ll get paid $750.” It’s more like “if I work this job I’m dedicating 40hr / week for $150.” Because they’re all but guaranteed the $600 if they do not work. I agree that businesses should pay their employees as much as they can but UI should not be this high. The trade off of work a full time job and make 100% of your income or choose to go on UI and make 85-90% is too lopsided.",

I'm a huge proponent of UBI and I think it's a trophy of our collective human experience to allow machines to do more of the work while people enjoy the fruits of their labor. \n\nFor the people who WANT to work- especially tradesman- I would love it if the opportunities were there. Well, if people want to work, why can't they? If it makes more economic sense to collect unemployment than return to work, why don't employers offer a higher wage? \"Ahhh those greedy business owners, they just hate giving up money out of their pockets!\"\n\nIt's not that simple. In fact, employers are desperate to hire. Why can't they? It costs significantly more for employers to pay a worker's salary than many people may realize. For example: your $20/hr wage that you need to survive isn't even close to what the employer actually pays. That hourly wage costs the employer (at least in California, where I live) well over $30/hr due to taxes and insurance. So when you ask for a starting wage or a raise, it could cost your employer well over 50% more than what you're asking for. \n\nI would love to see the government leverage the tax system through incentives to encourage employers to hire skilled laborers. I think this would free up capital for employers to pay more competitive wages while simultaneously encouraging the youth to purse jobs that actually pay (i.e. skilled labor). \n\nSorry, boomers. The days of getting a job to ride a desk for 40 hours a week and supporting an entire family on that income alone are way over. \"Marketing\" and \"business analyst\" aren't really jobs anymore and the few that remain will see their days numbered.",

Retired now, but drove truck for 15 years. As a driver, you HAVE to take and pass a physical. You HAVE To take and pass a drug test BEFORE being hired. You HAVE TO go thru and pass a Homeland Security check. When I retired 5+ years ago, wages were either by the mile, run or by the hour.  Last time I looked several years ago, hourly drivers were making $22-$25 an hour. Part of it depended on your experience and qualifications. I've pulled doubles, triples, reefers, Hazmat and Rocky Mountain specials. And I STILL get the occasional email from companies asking me if I'd like a job with them and many are offering bonuses ranging from $1,000 to be paid after your first 90 days, up to $10,000 which would be paid over a years time. \n\nAnd I've been there, done that as a temp worker when I first got out of the Air Force in '81 and REALLY needed a job quick. Remember, this is pre-internet days so the newspaper with its classified section was the only thing available when looking for a job unless you knew a relative who was working some where and hiring. I dug ditches so a new water sprinkler system could be put in front of an office building, made plastic pots at a factory. These were different sizes and the kinds you put real & fake plants in. I was hired to do data entry, but found out within 5 minutes, this was a program I had NO qualifications on or had used before. Told the lady in the office this right off that, along with telling her to call the temp agency about this and don't even bother paying for me to show up because fair is fair. She kept me there the entire day filing paperwork, typing up checks, etc. for her. The temp agency didn't look so good, but I got one hell of a recommendation from her to the agency. \n\nThing is, some temp workers were bitching about not getting called often enough. Why? Oh, I wanna go to the beach with some friends of mine. This was during the week and all the temp jobs I worked at, you had weekends/holidays off, though not paid for the holidays. And the one I worked at, paid every week and had a couple of coolers filled with soda pop/water and small bags of chips. Didn't bother me one bit to grab  2 sodas and a bag of chips as I headed out the door with paycheck in my grubby little hand.  \n\nThing is, a lot of temp agencies will usually go for the temp to hire jobs for their employees as they get a bonus when the temp worker is hired. That's how I got 1 job as a truck driver. Found out my partner (we ran from Reno thru out Calif.) was making about double the amount I was, even though I was doing the same work as a driver. I didn't care....I was working and knew eventually (90 days later) I'd get hired.\n\nFlipping burgers has NEVER been intended to be ones main source of income.

One employee makes more than me and that’s because they earned it lol. I’d be ashamed if I had someone working for me and having to drive Uber or something - during COVID I paid everyone to not work. I mean honestly now my crew is so tight we are sort of like family (I literally just got home from an employees kids birthday party- I was invited not because I’m “the boss” but because their kids are amazing and I adore them. I was literally the only non family to attend. We are close and I’m lucky to have all of them in my life. \n\nAnyway sorry for my rant but Screw the corporate greed and let people live enjoyable lives so they actually love coming to work. It will benefit all.",

Quite literally meaning that to stay in business in a competitive world, doubling Min Wage means consumers pay... that raise, in product prices.\n\nOne can presuppose you have no concern about rising prices= inflation... a 6$ meal has to go to 8$ a meal.... so.... where has the raise in wage.. actually gotten the worker.. as he is a consumer also?\n\nWell, he might still starve then. \n\nLost in this touchy failure narrative about 'evil corporations' are things like who donates to politicians... that make Government Wage controls- min wage. And more importantly is seeing who promotes these wage increases- 90%+ are 'Public Worker Unions'..... which make way over Min wage, but get the same raise.\n\nThe Public(Government worker) is 97% of where all wages would be affected in a raise of min wage.\n\nThen take how Public workers derive wages- taxation.. not making something for sale, not flipping burgers..... taxation, Fed, State and local... taxes pay Public workers wages. Those wages well above 'Min wage, but will get the same raise(>< 7.5$ per hour) has to mean taxation is increased.. there is no money fairy, no beanstalk, no money tree... taxation.\n\nNow consider who does not get a (>< 7.50$ raise ie: going to a min wage of 15$) raise from the Min wage Increase. Most PRIVATE JOBS... or relatively few... compared  to 30+ million \"public Workers\".\n\nSo you have everyone paying the extra taxation for Government workers getting '7.50$' raise...\n\nBut not everyone gets that extra 7.5$ raise.... they still pay extra taxation.. meaning their net net actual income drops... so a government worker, making well over 'Min' gets his raise.\n\nNormally there are 2 private workers for every government worker.. do the math,,,,, every one taxed equally.... 7.5$ in taxation, everyone paying 2.5$ extra in taxes.... so the private worker in net net is taking a 2.5$ CUT IN PAY..... all for the narrative... 'living wage'.. that does little to nothing for living wage, reduces 2/3rds the countries workers net net wages.... but get those complaining about wages, the pretty well paid already, government worker... some 30 times as many as would be 'burger flippers' get a raise.\n\nOh yeah... and your 'happy meal just went up in price also.\n\nEnjoy Government Wage Control= double taxation.",

I just got around to thinking about it...\n\nAt my work I would have about 200 customers per 8 hour shift. Of those customers I'd say on average they'd buy about 3 things each, lets say 600 items I sold per shift.  If I were to get a $5 an hour raise, that would have been amazing, it would have helped me out so much in my life.  What would it have cost my customers?  The store would have to pay me an extra $40 a shift.  $40/600 items I sold means that the average price of every item in the store would have to increase by 6 cents.  That's it.  And that's for a $5 an hour raise!\n\nThis is a rather simplistic example, I know, but it still works.  Worth mentioning the 200 customers/day is ones I ring up, my co-workers would be ringing up 200/day too so the same 6 cents would pay for their raise as well.\n\nI just think about how many times prices have increased over that decade I worked there and how many raises I got...

They expected me to be there 8+ hours a day, run all the bar specials/events myself, work on weekends for special events and also represent them to the neighborhood, which also included hours organizing events for the neighborhood and going to board meetings. I'd often work 50+ hour weeks, without additional compensation. In the first year I raised their business by 1M dollars, because of effective advertising, effectively doubling their revenue. They gave me a $300 bonus in cash, and intermittant cash bonuses depending on the size of party I threw. One of my biggest made them $150k in one day, and they gave me a $200 bonus, but I can count on one hand the times I ever got a bonus. The second year, I raised that by an additional $500k, and I got no bonus. Then the owner told me he thought I was doing a shitty job and cussed me out during a staff meeting with all the managers, after he had thrown a lamp at a server because she had to go home early because of a childcare emergency. These people aren't paying ANYONE appropriately, are taking advantage of people and they know it because they view people as expendable, even in small companies, where solo people doing good jobs have large effects on revenue.

Republicans response is, it’s not the corporations it’s the people. In reality it’s both and for any group to claim one or the other is ignoring the complex labor force.\n\nThis isn’t one side or the other, its multifaceted. “Wages are too low!” Ok so it depends on the work being done, the qualifications needed for the job, and the industry the job is in. If it’s McDonalds, then we’re flipping burgers, no degree is required, and it’s a low margin industry in fast food.\n\nShould McDonald’s pay a living wage? Not for me to answer, but the humanitarian will say of course it is, the business person would say, it’s not the corporation’s responsibility.\n\nThen there’s a completely different side of the argument, which is the government presenting an opportunity cost for people. We’ll pay you $X of dollars per week and in return you get 40 hours of your life back, or you go out and make little more and spend 40 hours.\n\nI don’t blame people for taking Unemployment with no hard skills when they can make almost the same doing nothing. It comes down to, or used to come down to pride and the hope for a better future. People work to get ahead, and if you believe in climbing the ladder and getting ahead, you don’t sit on unemployment. So the broader sense is people don’t believe in the dream anymore.\n\nWhy don’t they? I’d argue government intervention. You don’t make $100k off the bat in any job. You work your way up, develop the skills, develop the connections, your 9-5 isn’t and shouldn’t be an end all be all. The government presented an end all be all to mediocrity and an opportunity cost where people would rather have time than work and develop that sense of pride.\n\nIs it the corporations fault? Depends on the profit margins and the work being performed. I don’t think a high school kid should make $15 / hour at McDonalds in her spare time. But I also don’t think a 35 year old should make more than her with the same skillsets but needs the job to support his family.\n\nIt’s not a one size fits all. This subreddit treats all issues as a one size fits all. It’s so complicated I can present 20 more examples, but the common theme is people stopped believing in the dream and government allowed them to settle for mediocrity.",

That's not an exaggeration; 11 line cooks and 2 dishwashers on a Friday down to 6 line cooks (apparently washing and sanitizing dishes after use isn't an essential enough position for Bloomin Brands inc). The company told each store they had to lay off half of the staff. The first week or so was extremely slow, and the move made sense to us. After everybody started to realize we were in for the long haul and more and more people were getting pandemic benefits, we were busy again (I'd say week 3 of the pandemic). On a normal, pre-pandemic Friday there would be about 13 or 14 of us and we would clear 20k in sales easily. Post pandemic Friday, we're running with a 6 man line (no dishwashers) doing 25k and closing an hour early because of the back logged orders.\n\n\nDid Bloomin Brands do anything to accommodate its employees? Nope. No bonus, no raise, no extra hours (they cut us from 40+ to 25 hours each) no extra help, no communication or direction from management. Business as usual.

I’m talking about stay at home parents and those taking care of other family members, mostly. \n\nI often hear about the labor situation in in the context of women being driven out of the workforce due to the brunt of new domestic labor being thrust on women (from lack of school, childcare, and the danger of retirement communities pre-vaccine). Lots of coverage about these changes being driven by necessity - but I wouldn’t be surprised to hear that a lot of it is also by choice... I just haven’t heard much discussion about it from that viewpoint. \n\nAlso, regardless the reason, the UI benefits alone appear to effect the economy in much the same way UBI would, in particular for those who need to or prefer traditionally unpaid domestic work. And so far, this seems to be a good thing for lifting wages at the bottom in lieu of a minimum wage increase.",

A restaurant entrée cost about 20-25 minutes of minimum-wage work.\n\nToday, a similar entrée will cost at least $8 or $9 for a small lunch special, and probably around $15 for dinner, an increase of about 10-20x.

They’d rather appeal to people’s lizard brains, their hate and fear, in order to enact some 1984-esque society where they use Faux News and OAN to tell people what they should be afraid of and how to think.\n\nThey demonize education and Socialist ideals because they are the greatest threats to them. That’s what could keep them from their bonuses and lobbyist money, an educated and motivated population. They’d rather have us fighting amongst ourselves and caught up in idiotic populist politics, because that keeps us distracted from the real fight.\n\nSocialism isn’t perfect by any stretch, it has some horrible aspects, but we as working-class have so much more power than we realize if we’d just have the ability to work towards something meaningful. It’s sad to see the 24/7 news cycle, the partisan politics, the populism all taking a toll on any true progress that we could make.",

But even then the workplaces are usually the same, skeleton staff, everyone working multiple roles so the store can make more money. I was getting nearly $25 AUD an hour at my retail job but left due to the conditions, and honestly you could have paid me 4x the amount and I'll still leave. With a minimum wage being actually livable, amount of pay becomes less important to most over quality of work. I had to work my department, cover breaks in other departments, serve on checkouts and unload trucks all while expected to keep the shelves full. After a particularly busy 8hr shift I got called to the manager's office and given a warning about being fired because my department was trashed and I didn't do my 10 hours of jobs they left for me while spending a total of 4 hours on checkouts and 4 hours on the back dock unloading deliveries. Hell the company also had an ideas competition over the years, where staff enter ideas on how to improve the business and winners got $50 gift cards. I suggested one directly to a manager that saved time and resources but would have cost a little bit of money to set up and it got rejected on that basis. It would have saved money in the long run and I proved that to them. They only wanted ideas that they could write off on tax like pizza parties etc. The company loves tax breaks. They won't replace anything that's broken, that only gets 50% tax back. Repairs get 100% of the cost back in tax breaks, so they repair things over and over. If a store gets something new, it's a second hand repaired one from another store that argued for a new one successfully. Also any managers who stood up for staff got promoted to area managers or higher, so they then spent more time in offices or travelling and weren't there to stand up for the staff anymore. I witnessed this firsthand at 2 different stores with the company on different towns, and the replacement managers come straight out of their management school, ready to push what the bigwigs want (budget cuts etc)",

Perfect grounds for people with mental illnesses and money. Sounds kind of similar to slavery days, except they’re now paying pennies instead of food and shelter for their abuse, while taking away opportunities for the sake of more profit.\n\nLets take this opportunity to change things towards where they should be, a democratic progressive system, where people improve economic conditions steadily and gradually instead of waiting for the right person. No one working for most of their day (fulltime) should be paid less than livable wage where they can afford food, shelter and entertainment to sustain, until they want to pursue better opportunities, which follows having better education opportunities, TIME, and teachers to help those unfortunate catch up. Which follows again, livable wages making it worthwhile for teachers to work hard. If we change working hours to hours that allow people to enjoy time to themselves, businesses and the economy will thrive rather than rot, because everyone is so agitated, struggling and miserable.\n\n5hrs is enough for companies to have solid steady work from their employees, and splitting shifts will grow job opportunities since more people will be needed to cover hours through out the day.  Combine that with livable wages, and you have more people eager to work and maintain these life changing opportunities, while giving others a chance to pursue opportunities that might make them even more valuable to a progressive society.\n\nWith clear written guidelines of job responsibilities, rather than cost cutting, crammed, ambiguous responsibilities, that conclude in rippling poor performances and results, people will know exactly what they need to achieve and leave it to others who are more suitable for other responsibilities, resulting in thriving businesses. For the business owners, clear, written guidelines will also hold employees responsible if they don’t perform those said responsibilities.\n\nIf old businesses won’t, new business will, resulting in old businesses losing employees for the new ones while losing their profits.\n\nIf you want to join this nation, learning the language, and be proficient with it. That's one requirement I believe should be a standard, and doesn't mean you have to abandon your native language.\n\nConsidering how crazy people acted and steered and supported the world in a genocide direction, these ideas are much less crazy and I doubt the results would be worse than silent blind genocides and on going sadistic greed.",
