And they go around pulling rope ladders off the fence all the time for those useless fences out in the desert. Of course they monitor people crossing the entire time. That's what's so insane about this, with all of our surveillance technology which has come a long way since the invention of walls, we can see every foot of the border. The issue is not that they're crossing without our knowledge and that somehow a barrier will stop it.\n\nThe issue is that there are groups of exploiters known as \"coyotes\" who will convince these immigrants from Central America that an asylum claim will solve all their problems - in exchange for everything they have. A lot of them do actually have family in the US legally and they plan to stay with them but they can't get a visa. So they cross the border, wait for CBP to show up and arrest them, and do as they were told to say: \"I'm requesting asylum\". Once they're on US soil we're obligated to keep them somewhere until the claim can be heard before a court.\n\nIt's not the monumental issue that's to blame for all the nation's problems, as the GOP would have you believe. In the big picture it's a very minor issue that the GOP has used to demonize to appeal to older racist white voters. But if you want to stop the problem, all you have to do is overhaul the legal system so that asylum claims are expedited and it's not dragging down the system with claims that take 2-3 years to process through.\n\nHell of a lot cheaper than building a wall.",

Soon enough surely mental health for the thousands of little girls and teenagers that have been sexually assaulted enroute to the US. Thank you Bidens first round of executive orders.\n\nIf you don't believe this, they are being bussed and sent everywhere in the US. There's 3400 of a potential 6800 kids at the pomona fairplex in Los Angeles county and they are paying with fema money all the amenities listed above. Most things they don't provide for most of our homeless and impoverished children are going to non-citizens. The wall and previous policies drastically crippled this human trafficking opportunity for drug cartels. The next boom in business will surely be guns and drugs being worked across now that they have more money to work with.",
