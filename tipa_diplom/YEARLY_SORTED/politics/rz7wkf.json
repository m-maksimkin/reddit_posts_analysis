This ol’ gal is downright shameless.\n\nHer district out in California includes San Francisco, where StarKist Tuna’s headquarters are located. StarKist is owned by Del Monte Foods and is a major contributor to Nancy Pelosi. StarKist is the major employer in American Samoa. Pelosi’s husband, Paul, owns $17 million dollars worth of StarKist stock. In 2007, when the minimum wage was increased from $5.15 to $7.25, Pelosi had American Samoa exempted from the increase so Del Monte would not have to pay the higher wage making Del Monte products less expensive than their competitors. Last week when the huge bail-out bill was passed, Pelosi added an earmark to the final bill adding $33 million dollars for an “economic development credit in American Samoa.”",

            "text": "It is time for the American people to stop believing that \"the right people\" will fix our country.\n\nThere seems to be very little evidence that voting has much of a tangible effect on the decisions of the representative body. There is very little relationship between the desires of the populace and the votes of Congress members.\n\nI firmly believe that voting is pushed so hard because it generally doesn't solve our problems, and that's how the ruling class likes it. Every time government misbehaves, we are gaslight into thinking it is our fault for voting poorly.\n\nNo. It isn't. Or at least, not for that reason.\n\nThe eventual goal needs to be an increase in measures of direct democracy, including:\n\n1. Earmarking of a minor portion of tax money to allow citizens to donate to the particular governmental apparatuses they most support, thus voting with our dollars\n\n2. Direct voting on a small number of bills per session in the vein of ballot measures. Ballot measures have consistently passed progressive legislation in the red state of Missouri for several elections that I have paid attention to and perhaps longer. We need more of this.\n\n3. Direct submission of bills by third parties and a ban on laundering such bills through politicians (i.e. Shell writing a bill and acting as though their shill wrote it).\n\n4. Tracking of changes to US law via a version control system such as Git or MediaWiki (used to power Wikipedia and Fandom, formerly Wikia). We need to be able to see who is responsible for every single piece of text in the US legal code.\n\n5. Enforced transparency for all federal and state agencies in the form of a monthly newsletter sent directly to all citizens giving updates on the activities and policy changes within those institutions. Opt out is possible, lasting a year. \n\n6. Adoption of the direct popular vote by approval voting for all federal and state elections.\n\n7. Federal requirement to record every moment of deliberation on redistricting.\n\n8. Term limits to 12 years in Congress total.\n\n9. Federal and state agencies need mandated transparency for their workers at the minimum. As it is, teachers, post office workers, social workers, state level LEOs, and so on have no power within their own institutions and typically have to rely on strikes and huge initiatives to be heard. It is vital that every major decision and personnel change in these agencies be communicated directly to all workers under their authority on a monthly basis, exceeding the requirements for what is sent out to everyone else. I would personally argue that public employee bodies should have supermajority veto votes--these would be a means of collective action which can prevent the need for strikes. These would be directly counterable only by the senior most executive of that body, i.e. the president or governor, to centralize accountability for ease of voting. We disallow strikes in this group, and I understand the nominal explanation of why, but they still need some power. Voting is a peaceful means of dealing with the issue.\n\nElections should be better managed, yes, but they should only make up a portion of the people's power. Voting is not the fullness of democracy. It is the base requirement. A vibrant democracy requires other actions and other means of voicing the people's wishes.\n\nThat is a vital check and balance not considered by the developers of the US constitution. If you try to take away one of the people's powers, you will have to get past another one to do so. We should have had recourse all this time to stop destruction of our voting rights. But because we HAVE no other powers, that does not work",

Ossoff himself has millions of dollars in various equities. Although it's all in a \"blind trust,\" so it would be somewhat harder for him to use congressional knowledge to trade them at an opportune moment, he's still motivated to pass laws that benefit the companies that he owns. (*Side note: he's in his 30s, so he's orders of magnitude less interested in selling equities at this stage of his life than his much older colleagues would be.*)\n\nPoliticians are already banned from trading stock based on privileged information, so truly problematic stock trades rarely happen. Yes, there are exceptions (e.g., Richard Burr) and politicians who violate those rules should be expelled from congress. But congress already has the power to do that.\n\nEven if Trump's assets had been put in a true blind trust, it wouldn't have changed the fact that he was always going to be unwilling to sign any tax reform laws that disadvantaged real estate developers.\n\nThere is simply no law that will change the inherent problem of politicians with valuable ownership stakes in companies being tempted to use their power to advantage the types of companies that they own.\n\nThe best we can hope for is establishing norms that encourage politicians to be completely transparent in revealing their assets as candidates and then holding their feet to the fire when they do anything self-serving while in office.",

Congress isn’t a government of the people, for the people and hasn’t been since this. \n\nhttps://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained\n\nThe Supreme Court decided that corporations have and endless ability to sway members of Congress with bottomless funds. So the people who are voting on whether or not they can own stocks, really have no fealty to the citizens. Ask yourself why our healthcare is so complicated and expensive since the government got involved. It’s because the policymakers are invested in those companies. Ask why we spend so much on our military. Especially this gem. \n\nhttps://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-05/us-navy-spends-37-billion-ship-that-barely-works/\n\nThe article is old, but the problem still exists. We spend billions on war machines that don’t even work. Why, any sane person would ask? Because members of our congress are heavily invested in the companies that sell this worthless junk. \nHere’s a more recent story, same end. \n\nhttps://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a35631305/f-35-doesnt-work-1-7-trillion-dollars/\n\nThe headline on that article, WE ARE BUYING PLANES THAT DON’T WORK AND ARE SO EXPENSIVE WE COULD CANCEL STUDENT DEBT. So it’s absolutely foolish to think our elected officials are going to vote to cut off their “free money”. Congress won’t police themselves. It’s 4-5 honest people fighting 230 dishonest people. Those people care way more about their own bank accounts than a single person in their constituency. \nSorry for the rant. The whole topic is dismally depressing and an obvious signpost to the dystopian future becoming worse.",
