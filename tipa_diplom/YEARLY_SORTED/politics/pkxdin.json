Such civilian employees and contractor personnel who are unvaccinated for COVID-19, as defined in this guidance, or who decline to attest to their COVID-19 vaccination status will be subject to COVID-19 screening testing at least weekly as set forth in this guidance (Attachment 3). Such civilian employees and contractor personnel who refuse required screening testing, will be denied access to DoD facilities. Service members who are DoD contractor personnel are subject to the requirements in this paragraph.\"  \n\n\nAttachment 3 lays out testing procedures. Interesting to note that they only allot 1 duty hour to travel to the test site, get tested, then return back to work. Meaning, if your testing site is particularly busy and more than 1 hour is used, the extra time has to be made up. Section 6 of attachment 3 lays out consequences of refusal to get COVID-19 testing by unvaccinated DoD civilian employees. \"DoD components may initiate adverse employment action, up to and including removal, against unvaccinated civilian employees who refuse COVID-19 testing.\" They also mandate that DoD components can bar you access to your worksite or the installation as a whole, put you on telework or administrative leave.
