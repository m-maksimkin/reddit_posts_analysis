From this thing the most inspiring detail is that the aforementioned possible bill that being working bans spouse and direct family from selling and trading stocks and holding them in a \"blind trust\". But what does blind trust mean? So they can hire a broker and have them trade and sell what they want and tell them too. You have to get mad about these things and pay attention to your local representative. Sorry if this sounds like a rant but it is. These kind of things make my blood boil",
