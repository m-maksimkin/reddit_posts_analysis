First of all, I don't think that making cities into states is a good idea in general. Ideally DC should be incorporated into Maryland or Virginia. I believe the issue is that Maryland and Virginia don't want all of those Democratic voters either. Given that, DC statehood does make sense as a last resort, since they should be allowed proper representation. At least from my perspective the story about Maryland and Virginia refusing to take in DC voters is important.\n\nEDIT: For anyone who's upset about the suggestion that incorporating DC into Virginia or Maryland is the most fair option, please explain what would be wrong with that if Virginia or Maryland allowed it? It seems to solve all problems we're discussing. It solves the issue of DC not having full federal representation and it prevents us from adding a new state that has outsized federal representation like Wyoming.",

Without it, not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity, but a dependence of the members of the general government on the State comprehending the seat of government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national council an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the confederacy.2",
