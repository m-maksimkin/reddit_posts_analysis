She is representative of her district, as Jim Jordan is representative of his Ohio District.  They are both Trump Republicans, and like Trump, they say out loud what other Republicans are thinking; don't be fooled by other Republicans' statements, look at their records.  Liz Cheney is anything but a flaming liberal, or even a middle-of-the-road conservative, but she was given the boot, both in The House, and by her State GOP, simply for not being 100 percent for Trump.  The Republicans have \"sowed the wind\" and are now \"reaping the whirlwind\".\n\nI would say too, that simply calling bad names, and blaming all Whites in this Country, accomplishes nothing, nor do marches and riots; that simply strengthens the Republicans' hand.  Joe Biden is doing a reasonably good job with the hand he has been dealt; but he also needs a lot of help.  He does need to take a page out of Harry Truman's book, and call the Alt-right Republicans, and Donald Trump what they are:  the Red, White, and Blue version of Hitler's Nazis; they have all the characteristics.  Defunding the Police, and all of the national handwringing going on, will also accomplish nothing. What we need to do; is first, get those elements out of our police forces, sheriffs' departments, National Guards, and Armed Forces, whose allegiance is not to The Constitution, but to Trump, or someone like him.  There are poor Whites, as well as Hispanics and Blacks, who have been victimized by the Republicans, Ronald Reagan, George  Bush (both of them), and Donald Trump.  I could give you many, many, many, more names; but I'll send you a list.  In short, our Congress, Judiciary, Statehouses, and Corporations; are lousy with them;  Look at their records, and there are many Blacks, and Hispanics among them.  Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, (I think) and definitely Clarence Thomas, are among them, as are Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch.  Again, look at their public statements, and decisions.  We need to demilitarize our police, and retrain them, so they stop acting like an occupying army, and more like public servants.  There are others; of all ethnic groups, races, and creeds; who are doing their best to destroy this country.  Beating up and killing each other, will accomplish nothing.  Arresting and prosecuting scofflaws, rioters, those who forge documentation of all types, rogue and corrupt police and politicians, and those who assault store clerks, security guards, and Airline employees; along with our neighbors, and fellow Americans, will accomplish far more.",

Just because right-wing antisemitism is more overt, doesn't mean it's the greatest threat.\n\nAntisemitism is masked through political causes, by taking the Jewish body collective and portraying it as the cause for all harm one's voter base disagrees with. Whatever you think the major societal ill is you mold the Jew to fit that narrative.\n\nDo you hate globalism, immigration, communism? Blame the Jew, they're the ultimate offender.\n\nHate apartheid, capitalism, genocide, human rights abuses? The Jew is the ultimate offender bar none.\n\nCori Bush Tweeted not long ago, \"why are we sending millions to Israel when we don't have healthcare?\"\n\nBecause replenishing Iron Dome saves tens of thousands of lives Jew and Arab alike, and we routinely give aid of similar sums to our regional allies. \n\nSupporting Jewish survival isn't the reason you don't have healthcare, Cori. Akin to, \"why are we accepting refugees when we have homeless Americans?\"\n\nRight-wing American antisemitism is a wolf in wolf's clothing. Left-wing antisemitism is a wolf in sheep's clothing: hyperobsessed anathema toward Israel that is applied to no other place (e.g. 28 million Yemenis on the brink of starvation because of Saudi Arabia and Iran; 1 million Uyghurs in concentration camps; ); claims of Jews 'controlling' in the music industry; etc. It's masked as a political cause \n\nIf you only care when it's a conflict with Israel, you don't really care. You're pinning it on the collective Jew. The left views itself as the good guys and are incapable of stepping back for a moment and saying, 'hmm. Perhaps my political cause is influenced by 2,000 years of societally baked in antisemitism.'",
