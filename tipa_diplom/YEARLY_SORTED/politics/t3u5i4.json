Inflation most definitely happened. The money supply was expanded dramatically for the reasons we know (military spending, social programs, and pandemic relief). The problem is people are accepting the BS propaganda that the expansion of the money supply benefited regular people. It did in a small way, temporarily, but the vast majority of wealth generated was transferred to the top 10%. \n\nMost people live check to check. The weekly infusions of stimulus and unemployment cash are all spent. But after it was spent by the original recipients, where did it land? Back in the hands of the landlords and corporations; benefitting the already rich, and already politically powerful. \n\nNow that the spigot is running dry, they are raising prices on everything in hopes that their profits continue to increase. \n\nModern day inflation has little to do with modern day consumer prices, because the wealth that was created was not distributed to most people. The wealth was simply handed over to the already-haves. \n\nCorporate profiteering is absolutely taking place, but that has to do with shareholder primacy. Corporations are obligated by law to act in the interest of their shareholders above and beyond all other interests. It‚Äôs simply unacceptable for a corporation to make the same profits year after year. Shareholders want profits to increase every year. Those profits are not distributed to employees.\n\nSo, there is inflation, and there is corporate profiteering, but one is not the cause of the other. \n\nIt can be argued that modern monetary policies that caused the expansion of the money supply (inflation) are highly correlated to the profiteering we see with corporations, but it‚Äôs virtually impossible to draw a causal relationship without sounding like a conspiracy theorist.",
