Consider how observant Jews and Muslims have a religious schedule that is tied to the motion of the sun; in DST, they have to shift their schedules back an hour in order to break fasts (e.g. Ramadan) or engage in work (Shabbat).  Given how DST is all about changing the clocks to take advantage of more daylight in the afternoon, it presumes that all other schedules (work, school, commuting, etc.) stay the same; for Jews and Muslims (or others who have religious rites and schedules timed to the Sun), this means that they're forced to wait an extra hour while getting up at the same time.  For others, this wouldn't be such an issue who could set their own schedules, but many don't have this luxury.\n\nA number of other countries have experimented with using permanent DST before, but just as many seem to have reverted after noting problems with it, especially in wintertime with such long, dark mornings, and there are a number of experts recommending sticking to *standard* time year-round for the general health and well-being of most.  (And before people go on about light-availability depression like SAD, yes, I know, and some people also have it in the *opposite* direction, to say nothing about how some people prefer more light in the mornings than the evenings.)",

[Link to episode page](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/matters-of-time/4/)\n\nThe US has already had this during the energy crisis in the 70s and we immediately went back because people hated it. UK has tried it twice and they went back. For all its faults DST is actually the most preferred option because people hate having long dark mornings more than they hate an earlier sunset.\n\n**Listen to the whole podcast episode if you have time though.** Another super interesting piece was how China has only 1-time zone based out of Beijing, the easternmost part of China. The size of China would require 5-6 time zones but they force everyone to have the same. Where the Uighurs are from is basically the equivalent of San Francisco compared to NYC and they are forced to keep their time the same as Beijing. This forces everyone to think and look towards Beijing the political center and model for the rest of the country. It goes into how you can be identified as an Uighur just by how you talk about time and they spy on phone data just to see how you refer to time to discover if you are Uighur and not assimilating to the desired culture.",

California and the guys over there are pretty cool and all, but only for like half the year, you know? I love that Los Angeles makes all our movies, and gives phoenix all it's culture, (in the way the lead human in a human centipede gives the next person in the chain its food), but I don't wanna be stuck with their time zone.  Maybe back in the 80s when they were making great action flicks like Predator 2, but not now.\n\nThe ending of Predator 2 was awful though. It could have been saved **if the predators had allowed him to keep the predator's skull as a trophy, instead of an irrelevant 300 year old pistol.** The worst part was when our protagonist decided to climb down the side of the building, instead of going back inside and taking the damn stairs. But the movie has to happen! I think of the Pitch Meeting (by Ryan George) would be, \n>\"So you've got a sequel for me?\"  \n>\"yes sir i do\"  \n> etc. etc.  \n> \"and then he climbs down the side of the building to get to the alien.\"  \n> \"why doesn't he just go back inside and take the stairs?\"  \n> \"because I need to build more tension to the climax sir,\"  \n> \"yeah, but there's no reason for him to risk falling to his death just to get down there\"  \n> \"I'm gonna have to ask you to get all the way off my back about him climbing down the building.\"  \n> \"OK, let me get all the way off that\"  \n\nI don't watch many sketch comedy channels on youtube, but Ryan george consistently hits my funny bone. I tend to lean more toward educational youtube.  My favorite is probably \"Medlife Crisis,\" run by British doctor Rohin Francis. [Here's a great video of him doing a tier list of human organs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtfwmRlQAmQ). Another favorite is 3blue1brown; [here's a fantastic video he did about fractals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4). If I had had these videos while I was at university, I might have passed calculus.

As I leave before it comes up regardless of the time of year, and I have headlights. \n\nI do get a massive amount of stuff done with an extra hour after work. I can get things done that would eat up a day on the weekend otherwise.\n\nThe only single reason I’ve seen people give for the winter hours is kids getting on a school bus in the dark. Well, guess what? The hours they want, I saw kids getting on a bus in the dark every day at 6:30am. So if it doesn’t matter and they’re doing it in the dark anyway, I’d prefer to have evening light to do something productive.\n\nIt would even be better for the economy. I know many people who can’t see well to drive at night/dusk and they skip events because of it. They’ll be out later, eating, shopping, etc.",

            "text": "Kinda late, but I have mixed feelings about this. While I’m super, super glad they got rid of the switch between standard time and DST every year, I feel they should’ve made standard (“fall back”) time the normal one. I prefer lighter mornings and darker evenings, as that’s best for our circadian rhythm. Studies have proven that standard time is much better for us, and it’s near impossible for our bodies to actually adjust to DST due to our biology. I guess the Senate’s reason was that there would be less crime in the evenings, but that also goes hand-in-hand with darker/more dangerous mornings for children waiting on their buses. Well, the House hasn’t passed this yet I don’t think, but I guess one being permanent is better than neither.",
