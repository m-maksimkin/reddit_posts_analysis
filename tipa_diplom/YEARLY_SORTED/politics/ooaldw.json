We can argue over whether he paid enough taxes, but his effective income tax rate was 23%.\n\nI understand that his net worth rose by more than $4 billion, but that's not especially relevant, since he can't actually use the money until he sells the assets that make up his wealth. He could lose half of that wealth next year, if the market doesn't go his way. And when he does sell, he will be subject to a 20% tax rate.\n\nPersonally, I think that the tax rate ought to be higher for people as wealthy as Bezos. Bezos has publicly stated that he thinks so as well, and has donated to candidates who promise to raise capital gains and income taxes on the wealthy, including Joe Biden. So it appears that he's being demonized only because Elizabeth Warren likes to practice the politics of envy, and so will always use whomever happens to be the wealthiest American as a punching bag.",

Guy does something even 10 years would be seen as borderline impossible, and your first thought is to try and “dunk” on him? \n\nI mean yes, Bezos pays what is not a “fair share” and he should.  But also, the guy pays more individually as a single person (about $1B) then the bottom 10% of people probably pay collectively. Considering the bottom 50% pay 3% of federal taxes.  Got to imagine the bottom 10% pay an incredibly tiny fraction although I couldn’t find that stat. \n\nThat is not to say what’s “right” or what’s “just”. But it is to say it’s still a shit ton of money on a gross basis, even if not a “fair share” on a net basis. Further, it’s worth considering when reading articles: If they say something like this (Forbes), “the difference between federal taxes legally owed and those actually collected”, they do not mean “legally”.  That is 99% of the time used in an overly broad, non specific manner.  I.e. if it was legally owed, and he wasn’t paying it, he would be in jail. What he does do is find perfectly legal procedures in tax law to reduce his taxes as low as he can while within (or toeing the line of) legality. \n\nOnce again, hate Bezos.  Guy definitely can find more ways out of taxes because he has so many fucking resources to find ways to maneuver out of taxes. And that is very frustrating.   But honestly, who wouldn’t if they could? I get furious paying my couple thousand a year in taxes. \n\nTLDR: give the guy a day for achieving something great before dunking on him in a cheap manufactured statement for political points.

Odd that she is worried about somebody **not paying enough tax due to the tax laws she and Congress have passed** but she has no issues with massive deficit spending on her path to expanding dependence on the gov't over self reliance. Just my opinions.  How many people here pay more tax than is legally required? Jeff Bezos started out Amazon with a family loan and a crapload of hard work and intelligence and built a huge success. He could not have done this in any other country on Earth. It is called freedom and it is scary to many. Sad now many wish our country to become a welfare state which punishes achievement.

            "text": "Everyone in the world has been watching the US population being duped and exploited by its leaders and corporations for decades. The only one not savvy is the population itself. It is being fed that bs that the US is the best, number one in the world, so why look critically at anyone else with the possibility that there is a lesson to be learnt from someone else?\n\nFor decades US-Americans have been lecturing everyone on inclusive action, thought and language - absolutely, rightfully so - but watch any US movie, talkshow, be it from the right, center or left, and all you hear when foreign nations are mentioned are derogatory remarks. French stink and are unshaved, Germans are Nazis, British have bad teeth, etc. Putting others down to elevate oneself is very weak game. WTF!\n\nGet your crap together! I have lived, studied and worked in the US for a couple of years and can say that I really like the population. Some more, some less, but that should be normal. You are incredibly generous and welcoming. I remember that there was not one foreign student I knew who was left to be alone on Thanksgiving. Everyone was invited to a home and was welcome. That is an incredible, human achievement! \n\nYour corporations are not doing you any favours. They will do everything to be able to bend your free will even more and reliably than is evidently possible today.",
