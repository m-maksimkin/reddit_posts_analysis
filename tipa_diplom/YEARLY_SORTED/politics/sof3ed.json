They imposed tariffs, taxes and various other regulations on southern goods, as well as constitutional infringements upon state‚Äôs rights. They used those taxes and regulations to support northern industrialism. The south relied heavily upon agricultural, whereas the north relied upon industry. It‚Äôs important to note that the north and south had two very different economies and still kind of do. The north didn‚Äôt call out slavery until the south began making a ruckus, saying they would no longer stand for the heavy taxes and big government violations. They planned to peaceful seceded the union, as it had become a federalist, overreaching system. It was the north who went to war with the south. The north used slavery as a tear jerker to justify going to war with the south, because they knew they needed the south to sustain their industrial expansion. Many don‚Äôt realize that after the war, many northerners didn‚Äôt even want the Africans (now African Americans) in northern states. They wanted them ‚Äúfree‚Äù but didn‚Äôt want a thing to do with them. In fact, the very first black governor in the U.S was a man from Louisiana. He ran as a republican, and fought for the Union occupying troops. He eventually left the Union due to the prejudice he endured. Many also forget that the north had its own form of slavery. Children: Children were worked to the bone because there were no labor laws, they didn‚Äôt have to be paid hardly at all, and were not afforded the same human rights as opposed to an adult.
