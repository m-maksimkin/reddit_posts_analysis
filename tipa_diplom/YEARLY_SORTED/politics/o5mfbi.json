Isn't it best that we just try to ignore him as much as possible for at least a little while?  \n\nDid we learn nothing from 2016?  Trump doesn't care if you are praising or bashing him, he just wants to be in the spotlight.  And being a big, controversial figure constantly in the spotlight through all of 2016 is why he got elected.  If we had just ignored him like the bad joke he is none of this would have happened\n\n It seems the press just can't stop trying to turn out stories about him even now.  And for some reason we can't stop reading them.  But we have to stop.   I know it feels great to be all outraged.  And I know in a sense the trainwreck is wildly entertaining.  But please just stop.  Stop it.  If we aren't going to hold him to account, then don't give him the time of day.  He will wither away in darkness.\n\nBut if we keep talking about him, if we keep indulging ourselves on our own self satisfaction, then I guarantee 2024 will see the return of Trump (or one of his children) in a big way.

Great...but that doesn't change the fact that they're outside folks coming from all over the country during a pandemic. They deliberately engaged in unsafe and borderline illegal behavior with only the thinnest veil of dishonesty making it seem even close to 'legit'.\n\n\nOh also all of Trumps biggest donors are sponsors of the show that's why they don't actually do satire anymore. Resorts casinos is a very big sponsor of NBC and until he recently died its owner was one Trumps biggest donors. They just repeat rightwing stuff in a slightly exaggerated manner. They're basically just retweeting stuff they don't like.\n\n\nThe show is a public health issue. The show is a labor rights issue. The show is a political influence issue. And in a world where throwing paint on a statue gets you investigated, maybe someone should look into the horrible things that Comcast/NBC/SNL have been doing for the past 2 years.",

He was absolutely bound and determined to test the fences on absolutely everything - he did not consider himself bound by tradition, ethics, or norms on any subject. A lot of that was driven by egomania and just the stubborn refusal to learn anything about anything, but the end result was a presidency in which we discovered we'd been papering over a lot of really bad shit with, like, concerns for norms and appearances. \n\nAnd now, we know two things: 1. the holes are there, and they're glaring and we have real problems in the construction of the presidency and the expansion of the office over time. And 2. the American voter is not necessarily going to punish a president who finds and exploits them. We have a greater appetite for totalitarianism than we ever would have thought before 2015.\n\nThe next charismatic populist fascist isn't going to be a bumbling idiot who can't find the light switches and wants to use drone strikes to make comedians stop calling him dumb.
