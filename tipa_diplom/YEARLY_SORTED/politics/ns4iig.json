And not just because Republicans champion it.  As we all know, votes can be changed without any record of that change, and there's no way to recount or verify votes.  Biden won by .3% votes in Arizona, so it wouldn't take much to change the outcome.  That's only 10,457 votes difference, and it wouldn't be hard for Republicans to \"find\" 10,458 more votes for Trump, as is expected by Republicans, apparently.\n\nThere is still fraud using paper ballots.

Millions of dead people were sent ballots and hundreds of thousands were sent back filled out is a big issue in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania right now too. As long as this corruption benefits the Democrats they will push for it until it gets turned on them.\n\nWe can all hope that Nevada, where you need a driver's license or ID to do everything because it is a gambling state, at least wouldn't send dead people or at least require people to prove where they live so people aren't getting old residents ballots too.
