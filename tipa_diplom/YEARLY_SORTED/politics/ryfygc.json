Surely they can't be that bad, right?\n\n[lol hoo boy they *are* that bad.](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Convention_of_States_Action) Anyone that's outraged by the headline without looking at the source is easily manipulated.\n\n\nIn a June 2020 edition of his video blog The BattleCry with Mark Meckler, Meckler said that \"Black Lives Matter as an organization is evil. It is anti-American, it is anti-nuclear family; they say this on their website. It is pro-transgender- it's a mental illness by the way, you can't be pro-mental illness it's a terrible thing.\" [8] Meckler also told viewers that there is a danger in labeling ANTIFA or BLM a terrorist organization because \"most business insurance policies have an exception, in other words they don't cover terrorist incidents. And so that would mean if a business gets burned down and they've been declared a terrorist organization, no insurance coverage, so we've got to watch out for what we ask for.\"[9]\n\nIn response to Black Lives Matter protests around the country, Meckler told his viewers in July of 2020 that \"I'm sick of these thugs and these hooligans, whatever you want to call them, criminals, radical elements in society, Marxists, whatever you want to call them, running wild in our society, running rampant in our society.\"[10]\nCOVID-19 Reopen Protests\n\nIn April of 2020, Convention of States helped coordinate protests against COVID-19 lockdowns.[11] COS launched the website Open The States which allows users to organize on online forums and petition state and federal officials. According to Politico, in a COS Facebook livestream Meckler told viewers that \"Facebook…[is] literally working with the governors to find out what the policy is and they're trying to shut [us] down... So what we're trying to do is we're trying to create other ways to communicate with people about what we're doing.\"[12]\nConvention of States Holds First \"Leadership Summit\"\n\nIn August 2019, Convention of States held its first \"Leadership Summit\" in Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia.[13] That event featured many right-wing speakers including Fox & Friends' Pete Hegseth, Wallbuilders' David Barton, Charles Cooper, Eric O'Keefe, Rob Natelson, Tom Coburn, and Mark Levin.\nEmerging Leaders Program\n\nCOS hires college students and high school seniors for an internship program called the \"Emerging Leaders Program.\" In an interview by PragerU, all of the Students were from Hillsdale College. The interns work remotely, as COS does not have an office space.[14]\nClaims Medicare-for-All is Why \"we need to call an Article V Convention of States\"\n\nFollowing the first congressional hearings on Medicare-for-All, a proposal in its current iteration put forth by Rep. Pramila Jayapal[15] COS claimed that \"Nationalized healthcare\" is \"why we need to call an Article V Convention of States.\" The COS argument is that \"the Founders never imagined that the federal government would control industries as massive as our healthcare system -- or any industries at all\" further stating that an article five convention should be called to so that the United States can return to the \"Founders' original vision.\"[16]",

This is when someone who has inside information about how a company is doing changes their position to profit off of that information.\n\nCongressmen and congresswomen have the ability to change the law regarding a business’s survival and outlook. This is part of their actual job. They can’t ignore this.\n\nHere’s the paradoxical part. Members of Congress can participate in the trading of stocks, despite having no legal rights to do so according to the laws written by congress. Under the definition of “insider trading”, it is mentioned that inside knowledge can come from anywhere in the production chain— including the legal aspect. All Congress has to do is corner the market, then sell all their stocks in said market right before they drop the hammer on that stock for some arbitrary reason. Everyone else with stock in this company will be completely boned as they will now have worthless shares. But not Congress. This is illegal. Then again, this one always made me question the reasoning behind it. “I’m going to buy a part of your company!” “… Why not just buy the whole thing? Are you going to be responsible for your share of the costs? Are you going to be taking your share of the profits? Are you going to attend staff meetings?” \n\nWhat is the logical reasoning behind allowing the game rule makers to participate directly in their game? There’s a reason why in D&D we have the players, and the dungeon master. Who is the puppeteer for all the bad guys, but never profits from the actual gameplay. This is like playing Poker but changing the rules as you play the game. Once money is involved, hands off the rules. Once you are back in control of the rules, all bets are forfeit. These “rules for thee but not for me” mentalities are how corruption takes root.

There's 104 days that are weekends. That's 260 days to make money. They on average, are in session [146 days a year since 2001](https://www.thoughtco.com/average-number-of-legislative-days-3368250). When in DC they work about [70 hour work weeks](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sporcle.com/blog/2019/06/how-many-days-a-year-does-congress-work/amp/). Not everything happens in session but that's already lower days of labor than the average citizen and getting paid higher than the average citizen; although are working 70 hour work weeks. They do work outside of session, though, the previous source citing approx. 59 hour work weeks. \n\nIn 2018 there was [174 sessions of congress and 191 sessions in the senate](https://www.thoughtco.com/average-number-of-legislative-days-3368250). If they averaged 70 hour work weeks then, that's 34.8 work weeks which comes out to about ~2,400 hours of labor. Outside of the session congressman, reportedly, work ~[40 hours a week](https://www.thoughtco.com/average-number-of-legislative-days-3368250) on activities related to their position (like doing things for campaigning, planning for another session, communicating with press, etc). \n\nSo if we only include those 40 hours in weeks not in session (guessing that's part of their 70 hour weeks). There are 11 federal holidays but let's take of 50 days assuming our leaders are lazy. That leaves 80 days (16 work weeks) of labor with the hours coming in at 640 hours. Totaling ~3,000 hours in the years worrying about political issues, public concern, publicity, re election, and the problems no one likes to being up in any conversation. \n\nThey get paid, with this very non accurate guestimation, approximately 58/hour to worry about public problems. It takes up over 200 days of their year. \n\nI don't think the issue is whether they should be allowed to trade or not. The problem is the people being elected use their position to increase that 58 an hour to 100 an hour to a 1,000 an hour and on and on and on. Educate yourselves and others in your community about public electees, learn about them. I promise you, if the people elected into these positions were actually vetted by the voting public by their own research, the winners wouldn't be focusing on stocks. They'd focus on public affairs and issues; as a result they may get information which may help them buy the right call or put options. It was never meant to be the focus of their jobs, as it seems it is now, it was meant to be a bonus for helping society.",
