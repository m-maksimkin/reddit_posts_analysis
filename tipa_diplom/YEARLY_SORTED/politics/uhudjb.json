They just want to have assurances that the American slave wage labour pool will always remain full so that corporate productivity always remains steady; which in turn, strengthens the pyramid scheme that is US capitalism by guaranteeing more wealth and power to them in the long run. \n\nAlso, don’t be fooled by the bait-n-switch that the Supreme Court *allegedly* pulled with that “mysterious document leak”. The capitalists don’t want us talking too much about how the U.S. economy is on the verge of tanking into another recession which could mean catastrophic consequences for them. This “leak” worked exactly as planned as it took any and all talk about the flailing economy right out of the news headlines.",

Instead we have allowed Congress to devolve into a non-functioning 3rd appendage that exists solely to fundraise for the two political party machines.\n\nThis complete failure of the House and Senate to embrace their historical role as the primary (read: sole) driver of legislation and policy in our system has had two major detrimental effects.\n\n1:) The shrinking role of the legislature has caused presidents to fill the power vacuum and expand Executive power via executive action, which is immediately revocable by the next president.  There is no political or legal stability in this situation.\n\n2:) The inability of the legislative branch to tackle and resolve policy issues causes political groups to identify, select, and bankroll activist cases in an attempt to direct them to the SCOTUS and obtain a ruling that will bypass the other 2 branches of government and enact policy change via court decisions.\n\nBoth parties utilize these tactics. Both parties are complicit in our broken government. Voters are complicit in failing to hold congress accountable and falling into the political spin machine.\n\nThe failure of congress to do its job over the last nearly 30 years has caused this issue. We now have groups attempting to remove policy and legislative action away from the 400+ House Reps and 100 Senators and into the hands of 10 people, 9 on the court and 1 in the White House.\n\nThis is the symptom of a systematic failure of our government. It is not going to be solved by packing the court. The court is almost by definition supposed to be conservative and resistant to change. This ruling has simply forced congress to codify abortion into law should we as a nation decide to do so. The court does not exist to make policy. Democrats have controlled all chambers for 2 years now, they controlled all chambers under Obama, and numerous other time in the last 50 years.\n\nThey simply dropped the ball.\n\nIf you are angry, get involved. Learn the attendance rate of your House Rep, of your Senators. See how they voted on issues important to you. Vote out incumbents.\n\nThis is the only way this is fixed.",

After its born and u still dont want the baby, there are people that are crying to make kids and cant have kids of their own, who can love and teach those kids to enjoy life and learn everything there is to learn here in this place and maybe find out who their parents are and find out the reasons for their parents decisions when they were young and stupid.

Absolutely wild....in an absolutely terrifying way.\n\nHow can anyone be stupid enough to think that banning abortions (even though it won’t be country wide) is a thing. I hate to break it to you guys but prohibition  on abortion only increases the rate of illegal and often dangerous abortions. Women will die....a lot of babies will be born in bathrooms and discarded.  Then there’s the percentage of women will be murdered because they can’t get to a place where they can have an abortion and their questionable partners don’t want them to have a child. The young girls who get raped by a pedo uncle / father / brother / family friend etc. \n\nThis is such a disaster on so many fronts. Women will die, either via DIY or shady back alley abortion, or because they’ll just resign to their fate of forced pregnancy, not get any care and potentially have dire medical consequences because they don’t know they’re walking around with placenta previa....or they’ll become very depressed and...well, you know the rest.\n\nThe rights of the child are equal to the rights of the mother? \n\nHA!!\n\nThat’s rich.\n\nAnd the babies? I suppose it doesn’t matter then that a lot of them will be abandoned...and that’s a “good” outcome...many of them will be abused and neglected...some of them will be subjected to infanticide.\n\nIt’s fucking stupidity.  It’s 2022. People are allowed to have sex and still decide not to have children. Yes, in an ideal world birth control is universally accessible and flawlessly effective....but you’re tying to do away with abortion while simultaneously making birth control to act in place of needing abortion harder to access....and no, sorry I know it’s 97% effective or what have you, but that’s with 100% perfect use....I have children...one was an IUD baby ffs, another I was on birth control but I didn’t realize it’s more important to take a low dose pill at the same time every day.
