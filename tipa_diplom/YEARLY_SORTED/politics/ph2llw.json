It is now the life in her womb who should be both prioritized and protected. If her pregnancy is unplanned, either embrace it or consider adoption as an alternative. Every child deserves to be born. He or she was created by God for a very special purpose. The Texas law may well represent a precedent for ridding society of abortion in its entirety. We need more compassion toward the unborn and not to have them regarded as expedient and immaterial. Women have been brainwashed  by abortion providers saying that the procedure is safe or that \"you won't really feel a thing\". But  the woman is discarded like used Kleenex after the termination has been completed and abandoned to pick up both the psychological and physical wreckage of her life on her own.  Let us not forget the baby as well. That baby in the womb is feeling the total pain of its premeditated murder.Abortion is never a win for its victims only for the abortion providers who gleefully capitalize on a woman's vulnerability and/or desperation.

The heart is still being formed during the third trimester (starting at 27 weeks). Sophisticated ultrasound machines at or before six weeks of pregnancy detect a ‚Äúflutter‚Äù of electrical impulses from embryonic cells.\n\nForced-birth fanatics have also falsely claimed that abortion is linked to breast cancer and promoted the quack notion that it possible to ‚Äúreverse‚Äù abortion, so this stupefyingly disingenuous law is par for the course. \n\n Anyone who seriously believes that women with life-threatening pregnancies will truly be exempted or protected under this bill is blissfully naive or ignorant of Republicans‚Äô willingness since aligning with Donald Trump to lie, distort and misrepresent the facts on any issue. \n\n Moreover, preventing  a woman from exercising reproductive freedom‚Äî *even if it kills her* ‚Äîis a long-standing GOP policy goal. \n\nThe Republican National Convention‚Äôs platform every four years starting in 1980 has called  for amending the U.S. Constitution to completely, unequivocally and totally eradicate women‚Äôs reproductive freedom. No exceptions for saving the life of the mother, much less for rape or incest. \n\nThis Texas law is monstrously flawed in so many ways. It appallingly empowers forced-birth fanatics to morph into forced-birth vigilantes motivated by $10,000 bounties to spy on, stalk and literally snitch to the state on women and anyone attempting to assist them in seeking to exercise their still-constitutionally protected right to reproductive freedom. \n\nThis law also deliberately upends and circumvents decades of legal procedure and jurisprudence to effectively bar direct legal challenges to the law. The conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and a 5-4 ultraconservative bloc of the U.S. Supreme Court bought into this racket by refusing to hold a single hearing or otherwise accept any challenges to the measure before it became law‚Äîeven though the bill was passed and signed into law in mid-May 2021, nearly 4 months before it took effect.\n\nIf this irretrievably flawed law is allowed to stand, forced-birth fanatics will almost certainly next turn to contraception/birth control, which wasn‚Äôt legal even for married couples until the 1965 Supreme Court decision in *Griswold v. Connecticut.* \n\nReactionaries like forced-birth fanatics *never stop* with rolling back just one major individual or civil right.",

They don't care about facts, they don't care about women's safty/health, and they don't care about the kids that will be forcibly born to this world. \n\n\n The numbers on injuries related to back ally abortions are terrifying as well. World wide there are an estimated 20 million \"unsafe abortions\" performed. This results in an estimated 68,000 women dying from these procedures, and an estimated 5 million  with long term health effects. So this means roughly 1/270 receiving an unsafe abortion will lose their life, and 1/4 will have lasting health consequences from it. In fact, unsafe abortions are the leading cause of death for maternal death rates at a whopping 13%( that's an estimated 1 death every 8 minutes). \n\nNow the relation to unsafe abortions and restrictive abortion laws are of course in direct relation to each other. The median rate of unsafe abortions in the 82 countries with the most restrictive abortion laws is up to 23 of 1000 women compared with 2 of 1000 in nations that allow abortions. As you can imagine, abortion related death are much higher in restrictive areas/countries at 34/1000 per child birth in restrictive and 1/1000 per child birth in unrestricted.  \n\nThe common misconception down here(I live in TX) Is that if abortion is made legal, people will \"abuse it\" and use it as an excuse to have copious amounts of unprotected sex, thus getting a ton of abortions. This is inherently false. In countries where abortion is legal(Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands)the average rate of abortion between the ages of 15-44 is 10 per 1000 as where the inverse abortion rates(heavily unsafe ones) are 39 per 1000 women. This drastic increase can be correlated to a lack of sex ed(religious reasoning) and lack of contraceptives available. \n\nSo in conclusion, these law makers don't care about women, they dont care about kids, they only care about getting reelected and stroking their religios ego. Women's rights in Texas have been set back decades and Texas is trying to turn neighbors on each other. There is no good end with these types of laws in place.\n\nEdit:added stats and info\n\nSource: \nUnsafe abortions: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/",

I had had 13 up to that point and starting at the age of 7 or 8, I wanted them to stop. I was fine with the way I looked and fine with my own face. \n\nYes, I know that very concept is alien to most 13 year olds. I was forced to mature early. :)\n\nMy mom and doctor did the right thing and tried to convince me that I should continue with the surgeries. I stood my ground and said no. I was done. I told them that the state of Ohio recognized that at 13, I had the ability to make decisions about my reproductive health, meaning I could get birth control without parental consent, the same should apply to the rest of my medical health. So, I said no more surgeries and they stopped.\n\nNow, at the age of 40, if I lived in Texas, I no longer have the right to make my own medical decisions about my medical and reproductive health. \n\nThat is just one of the many serious repercussions that the Supreme Court is failing to recognize. I just lost a right that I earned 27 years earlier as a child. \n\nI am prochoice, not because I am for an abortion, but I have first hand experience of having someone else make medical decisions about my own body. It sucks. You feel helpless, hopeless, and can make you not even feel real. You feel like you are just someone else's plaything, a doll. Why get out of bed? Why live if you literally have the inability to make decisions about yourself? Are you even real at that point? I will not tell another woman what she should or should not do with her own body because I don't want that to happen to me again.\n\nWhile, rich women will still be able to get abortions because they can afford to travel, poor women in Texas are in the position I was at 13, except they have real longterm life changing consequences and no way out. They are going to have to deal with these consequences. Not the government, not religious nuts, not the State of Texas. Women. \n\nTo the Texas Legislature, while I know you will never read this, please stop trying to make women second class citizens in their own state. Please stop trying to take away rights that we earned simply by growing up. \n\nTry thinking of the issue like this. What if there was a law that demanded all women to get an abortion?
