This same government is using this kinda shit to distract from the fact they won't do anything about the republican led coup of 1/6. People spout off about their rights all the time but fail to remember their responsibilities so here you go I'll show you.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, **Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed**, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. **But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.**\\--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\n\\-Declaration of Independence\n\n[https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript) \n\nIf you feel like it can't be done ask yourself how people in pre-industrial times managed to strike, or change their circumstances? How did people in the late 19th/early 20th century get their workers rights? They sacrificed, endured hardship, and worked for their rights because the government back then just like now isn't gonna do shit for us without us actually making them. Work Strikes Nationwide, Mass Civil Disobedience, Boycott Useless Consumer Goods. No workers, consumers, or taxpayers negates the 1% and their government's power and shows we actually revoke our consent of their actions.
