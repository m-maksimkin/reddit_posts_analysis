Proving something is a product of I‚Äôll gotten gains is  difficult, but seizing something first and forcing the owner to prove it was not  the result of I‚Äôll gotten gains is illegal.  But, the US seizes money from citizens everyday usually at airports and on roads and highways, and they must prove its source is legal and proper.  The oligarchs are not necessarily Putin  co conspirators, but many are.  The problem with  seizure is it violates the innocent until proven guilty concept.  When your possessions are taken, and you are forced to fight for them  gives the government authority to deprive you of life liberty or property without due process, and it clearly violates the Constitution.    If the government can arrest you and take your money, and you cannot afford to fight the seizure, you may never get your day in court.  Today it‚Äôs Russian oligarchs tomorrow it‚Äôs citizens going to deposit cash after work.  Our government has proven that  they see this as a source of income, and it incentivizes and makes  for unlawful overreach.  I‚Äôm not a fan of Russia, but This should be discouraged not made commonplace.  I don‚Äôt believe our government should ignore due process just because Joe Biden thinks it makes him sound badass.
