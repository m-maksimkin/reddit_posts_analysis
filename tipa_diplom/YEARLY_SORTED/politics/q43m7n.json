However, I don’t exactly like Biden either, although I like him more then Trump, I question a lot of his decisions like his handling of the end of our involvement in the Middle East. I know that for any administration that decision would’ve been hard and that there’s no way we could’ve possibly trusted the Taliban, especially when Trump did nothing after his agreement with them. I just think there might have been a better way of going about it; like building a full scale defensive perimeter around the airport while evacuating all civilians and political officials who helped us for the last 20 years, and doing a full body search of all who entered the facility. I don’t know, maybe it’s that I try to look at things from all possible angles before giving my opinion, but I just feel like I’m the only neutral person in all this while everyone else murders each other over political ideologies.",

The Court granted that there was a limited executive privilege in areas of military or diplomatic affairs, but gave preference to \"the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of justice.\" Therefore, the president must obey the subpoena and produce the tapes and documents. Nixon resigned shortly after the release of the tapes.\"\n\nIf today's highly biased S.C. rules differently today then the Burger court ruled back in 1974, we are no longer in Kansas anymore and it gives the President unlimited powers to do as he pleases.

When Congress asked George Washington for access to his records of private deliberations with his cabinet and closest advisers in the government, he wrote back that if they started an impeachment investigation, all of the Executive branch records would be made available, without exception, but that the president is entitled to some privacy in the normal course of business.\n2. President Polk was placed under investigation for conduct during the Mexican war of 1846-1848, an investigation preliminary to impeachment. He replied to Congress that he was giving the House complete access to all of the records of his administration, in accordance with the precedent set by George Washington, and added that he was sure they would find nothing that was done improperly.  The House investigators concluded that no impeachable offenses were committed.\n3. When Andrew Johnson was impeached, I believe no effort was made by the administration to hide anything from Congress. \n4. In response to the impeachment investigation of Richard Nixon, 2 new precedents were created, apparently out of thin air. 1)  Nixon asserted the new principle of executive privilege, in violation of the constitution's statement that Congress has oversite over the Executive branch, especially and without any limitations in the case of impeachment investigations. 2) The Watergate prosecutors invented the notion that presidents could not be indicted while still in office, despite precedents to the contrary in the form of traffic tickets issued to 3 previous presidents (U.S. Grant, F.D Roosevelt,(?) and L.B. Johnson). \n5. Bill Clinton fought the House impeachment inquiry. Approximately 40% of presidents have committed adultery, so that is not a high crime. The steps taken by Clinton to conceal his adultery from congress was what he was impeached for. (Note that the  Speakers of the House who led the impeachment included a triple adulterer and a child molester.)\n6. In Trump's first impeachment, several of his co-conspirators were convicted of lying to the FBI and committing other offenses of obstruction of justice. They were pardoned. Accepting a pardon includes an admission of guilt.\n7. 1. In Trump's second impeachment, several of his co-conspirators were convicted of lying to the FBI and committing other offenses of obstruction of justice. They were pardoned. Accepting a pardon includes an admission of guilt.\n\nNo president has ever asserted executive privilege after leaving office, until now. The principle is less than 50 years old, but there is no indication that an ex-president can assert it under any circumstance except while advising the present president.",

He was also quite upset that when he was arrested, they didn't let him shower for 9 days. Lol, try joining the real Army, instead of parading around pretending to be soldiers.
