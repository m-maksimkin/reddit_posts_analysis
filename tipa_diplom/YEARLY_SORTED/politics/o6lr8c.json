The FBI and the rogue operations that seem to define it have destroyed many political movements, trained militia to perform coups, and killed innocent people like Jean Seberg among others.  I’m sure they do a lot to defend this country, but along the way they have forever changed international politics for the worse with their tactics, something that local police agencies could never dream of.  So yeah don’t defund cops, consider giving the FBI less money for rogue operations and Matt Gaetz probably did sleep with some underage girl just like so many major politicians are forced to just do they stay completely bought and paid for.  These people don’t speak their minds unless allowed to and sometimes they even have to have good opinions so they don’t lose their seats at the kids’ table.  You all remember that crazy Tucker interview with him, just try to make it make sense.  He’s been absolutely smeared and they will do it again to anyone who is trying to get a seat at the big kids’ table.",
