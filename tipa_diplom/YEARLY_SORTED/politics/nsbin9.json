Gotta give to the Dems; They were well organized in suppressing Repub votes, and loosenening up voting laws in many states that were actually not allowed by the state Constitutions. Zuck and his big-tech buddies censored almost anything that would have hurt Sleepy Joe, and then Zuck donated millions to set up voting boxes on street corners in Dem (but not Repub) districts. Signatures didn't have to be verified. Blanket ballots were sent out without the traditional system where mail-in ballots had to be requested. Then the Dems in the big Blue cities stopped the vote (amazingly all at the same time) on election night, when they realized they needed to call in more ballots. Joe is not the legit prez and anyone who is honest and paid attention knows it in their heart of hearts. The guy couldn't draw flies to a 'rally' if he was covered in feces. JPM knows who's in power right now- the Dems- so they are just hedging their bets as usual. The Dems have some of the most incompetent committee heads in US history- see Maxine Waters (BS in Sociology) as head of the House Financial Services Cmte. LOL.",

Define a period of time yearly when voters can freely assign the money in their election account to candidates and approved local referendums they support.
