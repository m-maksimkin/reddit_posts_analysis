He’s republican and republicans will ignore this story and continue blindly following the agenda. Democrats do it too. \n\nA politician could go on the news and preach helping the poor, and then immediately turn around, steal the jar some homeless dude has been collecting money with, spit in his face, and then murder him, and everyone would just ignore it and talk about the fact that he “cares about the poor! Look what he just said on the news!”\n\nPoliticians and so many others are held completely unresponsible for their actions. It honestly seems like a pretty sweet deal.",

Fuck this dude. Horrible character for a congressman. Leaders of the country shouldn’t behave like this. Congressmen and women are supposed to be the best of us to represent the area we live in this country to help get a budget to do things we need for our little section. These assholes these days are more interested in filling their pockets and scamming as much as they can off us. For Fucks Sake they shot a lady upstairs and killed her. What type of Tourist Visit is that?!?!",
