Now that the Cyber Ninja's have proven the votes were accurate they also showed we should never waste million of tax payer dollars on an \"audit\" like this ever again. So Republicans will enter into law a way to block all audits in the future. So then when THEY cheat next time and Dems need to prove it... They cant because audits like this are illegal because Cyber Ninja's proved how much of a waste of time they are.\n\nBoom. Plan worked all along. Set up a path for party X to cheat and stop any way to audit that cheating.\n\nWild I know but not implausible.\n\nEdit: to be clear Im not implying either Dems or Republicans cheated in the election.",

And then that crazy little mishap of droning a civilian and innocent kids oops. I guess it also kind of freaks me out that General Millie has no problem calling his Chinese counterpart to warn them when we're going to attack. Maybe that's due to some of that CRT training he's been getting. I suppose when you're \"WOKE\" that's more than enough reason to commit treason, and pretty damn proud about it. Americans are after all disgusting, racist, white supremacists, privileged, unworthy, etc.\n  Or we can talk about the southern border. That's just about as crazy as it gets when anyone from anywhere can walk right into your country, get benefits, \"AKA\"  welfare, food stamps, stimulus checks and whatever else, oh yeah transportation wherever they want to go. Raped and murdered on their way over here, indebted to the cartels to repay their transportation cost with future crimes.Oh, and no covid tests or vaccines. You really have to wonder why it doesn't matter if illegal aliens in our country are vaccinated, but American citizens are lied to, paid, threatened, coerced, blackmailed, and lied to some more, they come up with something new everyday. Isn't that scary to you?  Why are they so desperate to vaccinate us? He Killed Trumps policies that put America first. You know like quit letting China rip us off, get out of the Paris climate Accord, nuclear deals at our disadvantage, everything at our disadvantage. Great economy gone. Energy independence gone.  But hey we didn't need that keystone Pipeline, but Russia sure did. Doesn't quite seem right that Germany wants us to protect them from Russia at our expense but they want to buy their fuel from Russia hmm. Well that does sound like the hell of a deal. Oh big thank you too Biden for that gift that they got for absolutely nothing no. In my opinion he's destroying this country on purpose. He's a liar, he's brain dead, I plagiarist, corrupt, along with his family and everyone knows about his son the artist. And that's just a few of the reasons why I stated what my opinion is of Biden supporters. I don't know what he's done that hasn't been a disaster. I'm interested to hear what you have to say.",

There has never been much of a question of whether the ballots were counted properly.

Anyone and I mean anyone could have compromised these systems with very basic tools (Im not saying they were) .\n2. Without going into detail, **these systems had less patching and less security than your own home system you patch everyday**.  They werent even CISA compliant at a basic level.\n3. **These servers had no user-based auditing**.  This is a big deal in the cyber sec world.  The idiots were using shared passwords, shared accounts, etc.  The servers werent airgapped, i.e. were attached to the goddamn Internet, something that wasnt ever suppose to happen.\n\nOne of the solid recommendations from Cyber Ninjas so far:\n\nThe systems need to be \"brought up to the same standards as the rest of the industry and it needs to be independently audited by multiple vendors so those standards are maintained\".

The leaked report conclusively shows there were enough fraudulent votes, mystery votes, and fake votes to change the outcome of the election 4 or 5 times over. The number includes 23,344 mail-in ballots, despite the person no longer living at that address. Phantom voters! The official canvass does not even match who voted, off by 11,592—more than the entire Presidential Election margin. Voters who voted in multiple counties totaled 10,342, and 2,382 ballots came from people who no longer lived in Maricopa County. There were also 2,592 \"more duplicate ballots than original ballots.\" Just those fraudulent ballots alone total 50,252, and is fraud many more times than the so-called margin of “victory,” which was only 10,457. In addition, election data appears to have been intentionally deleted, and ballot images were “corrupt or missing.” This is not even the whole state of Arizona, but only Maricopa County. It would only get worse!\n \nThere is fraud and cheating in Arizona and it must be criminally investigated! More is coming out in the hearing today.",

Conveniently burned but votes must remain in. Well its better they announced it.. \n\nJust like to say congratulations to all the people who is now kicking their own rears cause this is what they wanted. Higher taxes, large inflation and i want to gove up my us citizenship so i can come in as a illegal. Get free housing, power, water,  medical and dental for whole year. Plus stipend and can go to college.. wow..  thank you biden for making Democrats love Trump!!! Might not like the way he talks but his action speaks louder than his words \n\nBiden is surely a individual that promised the democrats the world . No fracking. And other promises and he has broke all of them..  yeah i know Trump pays to sleep with porn stars and hookers, but at least it consensual... I guess it only works one way. We no longer believe..",

If the race had been between a .01 margin then sure.... maybe you could flip it. Meaning maybe you could say yes it was really too close to call. But you can't turn back time anyway... Even if all these recounts turned over great victories for trump. Biden would still be president and trump would still be a former president. There's no constitutional process to change that. So, this is all political theater of the worst sort. And all the agitation pundits that hyped this recount for the past how ever many months will quietly move on to the next manufactured scandal. And they likely won't even tell their audience about this.",

Cyber Ninjas are also blatantly ignoring court requests for their internal communications, so that legal fight is on going. It was a very Partisan process from the beginning and will continue.

Your guy still won, and you called it a sham and a fraud?'\n\n\nBut for me it wasn't about the outcome, but the process. Think of it this way. Say there was a crime, a crime so heinous that the entire State was swept up in the drama. A suspect is caught and sent to stand trial. In the trial a verdict comes back 'not guilty'. To many people it seemed a reasonable verdict, the state's  evidence was weak, there was several other suspects and the defendant lacked motive. All that the State had to go on was one  witnesses rather shaky description that the defendant passingly looks like.\n\n\nNow for some reason Republicans decide they don't like that outcome. They think this guy is guilty, in fact they're convinced of it. They're so convinced that they run a completely new sham trial outside of the normal legal system. They hire GetTheGuilty Inc, who have no experience in jurisprudence, but are generous donators, to run a new trial. \n\n\nFor 8 months, what used to take 8 hours they 'examine' the evidence with their handpicked witnesses only approved by GTG, they bring in every expert witness that was rejected as untrustworthy or insane (Mike Lyndell, fiber expert, why not?), they confer with their all Republican jury to feel their towards a verdict and months later they finally concede that no, there's not enough evidence to convict.\n\n\nIt's not the outcome, it's the process. In this process one party has set themselves as the universal arbiter of truth. An election isn't done until Republicans say they're done. A person isn't innocent until Republicans \nsay they're innocent. Justice is denied until Republicans deem a person, even a President, worthy of justice. \n\n\nThat's not how this should work, there is election law and an election process. The fundament of functioning democracies is if the process is fair and agreed upon the outcome must be respected. Bluntly, this type of audit shouldn't be allowed, there are legal mechanisms for recount. They were used, think the system is broken, empanel a jury of both parties to exam the system, not the outcome, to ensure it's fair.\n\n\nI'm glad the good guys won the day, but this should never had happened and should never happen again.",

It's not only pathetic that they are so willing to drop something because it didn't go their way, but it also shows how dangerous those places can be. If conservatives flock to the same handful of sites, and none of them report on something, their readership will likely never know of its existence. And worst of all, they *know* that.\n\nTheir attempt to overturn the election tripped at the first hurdle, and they'll never see it on the news sites they trust, and thus will never trust it if they don't just forget about it or never hear about it. Think about how many other stories, that have made them look bad, have been treated the same.

So much so that the senate ordered another machine recount.  During the machine recount of the audit it was leaked by the senate liaison to the audit that the machine recount numbers matched the official tally, not the numbers from the hand recount.  After that was leaked the senate liaison to the audit was barred from entering the counting facility.  He threatened to resign because he was concerned that Cyber Ninjas was going to cook their books to show that their numbers matched (because if cyber ninjas bungled the hand recount it would further delegitimize the audit).  All of the sudden it's coming up that the hand recount very closely matched the official tally.  I get the sneaking suspicion that the only reason the numbers closely matched is because of the machine recount that was ordered. \n\nSecond, I guarantee you that there will be other bullshit in the report.  Things like, we couldn't find the chain of custody documents for 10,000 votes.  Or there were 30,000 votes that didn't have enough creases in them.  Even if complete bullshit, there will be just enough obfuscation to add fuel to the conspiracy fires.  I guarantee you that by the end of today Trump will be declaring that the audit proves that he won AZ if only the \"legal votes were counted.\"\n\nRemember 2/3 of the republican party believes that the election was fraudulent despite no evidence presented.
