It’s entirely possible that these donations don’t need to be itemized as long as they can prove it’s all from small donors. I used to have to do campaign reporting and we never raised enough to have to itemize so we just reported gross numbers too. As long as all the donations were under $200 each, and no person cumulatively donated more than $200 they don’t have to itemize. It seems very unlikely that’s the case but who knows, trump had all sorts of grandmas and disadvantaged people donating tiny amounts to him.",

It matters when one sides issues are relatively non-existent while the other basically holds criminal indictments as a brand.\n\nIf you've always heard people say that there \"isn’t much difference between the parties\" when it comes to bad behavior and felt that couldn't be true, read below. And keep in mind, this is just those in the administration, not all the down ballot republicans getting caught in hotel rooms with underaged boys, tapping toes in the airport bathroom, embezzling funds from their campaigns or getting raided for child pornography and underaged sex trafficking.\n\n>“I made a comment recently where I claimed that Republican administrations had been much more criminally corrupt over the last 50 plus years than the Democrats. I was challenged (dared actually) to prove it. So I did a bit of research and when I say a bit I mean it didn’t take long and there is no comparison.\n>**When comparing criminal indictments of those serving in the executive branch of presidential administrations, it’s so lopsided as to be ridiculous.** Yet all I ever hear about is how supposedly “corrupt” the Democrats are. So why don’t we break it down by president and the numbers?\n\n* **trump (r) - 4 yrs in office.** from the Mueller investigation alone, 37 criminal indictments, 7 guilty pleas and 5 prison sentences. Most notable so far are manafort, gates, kilimnik, flynn, cohen, stone, papadopoulos, barrack. (Still actively developing - currently 13 active civil litigations against trump and 3 active criminal litigations ongoing as of 8/21)\n\n* **Obama (D) – 8 yrs in office.** Zero criminal indictments, zero convictions and zero prison sentences. So the next time somebody describes the Obama administration as “scandal free” they aren’t speaking wishfully, they’re simply telling the truth.\n\n* **Bush, George W. (R) – 8 yrs in office.** 16 criminal indictments. 16 convictions. 9 prison sentences.\n\n* **Clinton (D) – 8 yrs in office.** 2 criminal indictments. One conviction. One prison sentence. That’s right nearly 8 yrs of investigations. Tens of millions spent and 30 yrs of claiming them the most corrupt ever and there was exactly one person convicted of a crime.\n\n* **Bush, George H. W. (R) – 4 yrs in office.** One indictment. One conviction. One prison sentence.\n\n* **Reagan (R) – 8 yrs in office.** 26 criminal indictments. 16 convictions. 8 prison sentences.\n\n* **Carter (D) – 4 yrs in office.** One indictment. Zero convictions and zero prison sentences.\n\n* **Ford (R) – 4 yrs in office.** One indictment and one conviction. One prison sentence.\n\n* **Nixon (R) – 6 yrs in office.** 76 criminal indictments. 55 convictions. 15 prison sentences.\n\n* **Johnson (D) – 5 yrs in office.** Zero indictments. Zero convictions. Zero prison sentences.\n\n>So, let’s see where that leaves us. In the last 57 years...\n* Democrats have been in the Oval Office for 25 of those years\n* Republicans held it for 32. \n* In their 25 yrs in office Democrats had a total of three (3) executive branch officials indicted with one (1) conviction and one prison sentence. That’s one whole executive branch official convicted of a crime in two and a half decades of Democrat leadership.\n* In the 32 yrs that Republicans have held office over the last 57 yrs they have had a total of (a drum roll would be more than appropriate), **157** criminal indictments of executive branch officials. **96** criminal convictions and **39** prison sentences handed down. That’s more prison sentences than years in office since 1968 for Republicans. \n\nIf you want to count articles of impeachment as indictments (they aren’t really but we can count them as an action), in that time, the democrats have one (1) and the Republicans have three (3). Nixon resigned and was pardoned by Ford (and a pardon carries with it a legal admission of guilt on the part of the pardoned). So those only serve to make Republicans look even worse.\n\n* With everything going on with trump and his people right now, it’s a safe bet republicans are gonna be padding their numbers even more real soon.\n\nThose aren’t “feelings” or “alternate facts.” Those are simply the stats by the numbers. republicans are, and have been for my entire lifetime, the most criminally corrupt party to hold the office of the presidency.\nSo those are the actual numbers.

However, just to play devil’s advocate, it may very will be there is nothing wrong with the donations mentioned. Given just what I have seen in the media (TV clips, News articles, etc.) she may have raised this amount over the last 2 quarters. \n\nIn short, she has a very large following of individuals (probably 3-5x more than typical for office and area), which can attributed by the attention she gets from elsewhere (e.g. media, Trump, interest groups, etc.).  Largely, these individuals fall into the demographics who typically donate in such amounts (<$200).  In Georgia, when candidates file their disclosures they typically do not provide all the information for such donations because they are not required to do so.  Basically, without getting into the election laws, these are small donations and it is burdensome on campaigns to provide a long itemization of all of them (i.e. it sort of goes back to the history of small town days where people passed a hat around).  However, campaigns would have to provide more information upon request. \n\nDisclaimer: to put it politely, I am not a MTG supporter (i.e. I’d rather pull my teeth out). Although I am independent (I vote for the best candidate and not by party), I must say it is extremely disappointing how politics has changed so much where she could be elected; let alone stay in office.",
