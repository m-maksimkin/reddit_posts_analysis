This isn't a slam on Abrams personally. She lost in 18' in an election her party members came out in droves to trash Trump in those mid-terms, gaining seats in national and statewide offices. Every congressional/senatorial election in the last 50 years has seen the opposing party take seats back nationally in a new presidents first mid-term election. That's a significant trend, and Republicans are likely to come out in better numbers than usual because of this, just like Dems did in 18'. If GA did their statewide elections in odd years (like NJ and VA) I could see how she could avoid this trend. But I really don't see where the optimism is coming from for Abrams winning this election using massive historical data to beat an opponent she lost to four years ago with the opposite momentum.",
