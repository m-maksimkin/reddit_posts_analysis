            "text": "It's such an obvious no brainer, but...  Well. I'll surely be proven wrong.\n\n1.) A mind-bogglingly large number of of people think it's okay to ignore the democratic process within a democratic republic.\n\n2.) Despite there being absolutely no valid argument against the fact 1-6-2020 was an insurrection, lots of Republican politicians are pretending otherwise, or worse, justifying and supporting actions \ntaken by whitewashing the events and incitement.  This includes shitbags like Clyde (R-GA) try to say it was like any other tour.  (Big surprise from that state's politicians.). Yes, because every tour involves multiple deaths, millions in damages to the building, and has this same asshat Clyde filmed shitting his pants and screaming.  (PSA - To those unaware, Capitol toured are  NOT a cross between the Mackinaw Island reenactments and paintball. You'll get shot from here on out, I guarantee it.)\n\n3.) Expulsion is not based on allegations, but proof.  There will be lies about how it's a scam to get rid of opposition... I'm sure \"witch hunt\" will be tweeted about a billion times.  Fuck that.  How many \"representatives\" that try to kill this will be self-proclaimed \"Christians\" who suddenly don't think their god has a plan?\n\nWe need to do a lot of work to be the country we could be, and I don't mean sticking our heads further in the sand to pretend it's the 50's.  I don't pretend to be a leaned professor of anything (unless I'm in bed with my SO!  HEYO!).\n\nI would suspect term limits for all elected officials would be a good thing for all, even SCOTUS. If they didn't be some painfully political, there would still be value in measured apolitical continuity they could provide.  They're actually not even functioning like they should anymore but ignoring precedent.  They're supposed to sort of be the last line of defense against the fabricated turmoil of the corruption below them.  That went to shit thanks to... A lot of things.\n\nCitizens United is a dramatic blow to a government for the people, by the people.  The population should guide government, NOT business.  It was bad enough with lobbyists massaging old white male prostates to get what they want.  Now BILLIONS are funneled into politically motivated sharply divisive 'projects' by NON-VOTING entities to influence voting.  It has fundamentally and deeply destroyed the integrity of our political process.  International dark money spent to influence any election (local, state, federal) with the goal of making changes that potentially impact the entire nation.\n\nThat was certainly not the first step bringing us to this shit show, but it was HUGELY important to conservatives who represent an unarguable minority voter base at a national level.  The GOP exists to be the GOP, and that's the end of it.  They do not exist to be a viable party in touch with their purpose of representing EVERYONE, but specifically cater to a minority AT THE EXPENSE of the others. The party knows it's basically out of touch to the point that they whine that if rules/laws aren't shifted in their favor they they can't win!  I don't mean arguing for FAIR laws, but slanted in their favor because they have some Animal Farm mentality that they should get some sort of handicap because they're special.  Adapt or perish... Grow or fade away.  We do not live in the same world or grandparents did growing up.\n\nWe should also be pissed that more steps aren't being taken to ensure integrity in news. And I mean \"news\", not media.  Media includes the talking heads that do opinion shows that pretend to be news.  I'm not for stifling free speech even that I find repugnant.  News though must have some standards to be called that.  It's a slippery slope, but it's quickly becoming a necessity.  This should also include SERIOUS limitations on the breadth of news outlets that exist under one owner (human or corporation), and across all distribution platforms.\n\nWhat's so sad is that much of this damage was done, and continues to be done by one party that represents a minority of Americans.  They can only exist because of these problems, so they will fight, cheat, and lie like hell to make it even worse.",

Instead what needs to happen is they need to be prosecuted for insurrection and treason so that they become automatically ineligible for their office and immediately removed.  Much easier to convince 12 people off the street that someone is guilty than to convince a party to kick out its own member.\n\nEdit: Article I, section 5 of the United States Constitution provides that \"Each House \\[of Congress\\] may determine the Rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.\"  Dont confuse this with 14th Amendment section 3 - No Person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\nEdit 2: For all those saying that treason would require us to be legally at war with another country/enemy.  Levying war isn't limited to formally declaring war. It includes any forcible opposition to the execution of a public law. Such \"forcible opposition\" ordinarily requires actual use of force by multiple people with the common purpose of preventing some law from being enforced. Weapons aren't always required; sheer numbers can be enough. Merely conspiring to overthrow the government isn't levying war‚Äîthere must be an actual assemblage of people who are ready and intend to use force. So, no person acting alone can be guilty of levying war. The insurrection on Jan6th as well as all the congress members who conspired together to organize the insurrection would be prosecutable for treason.  The terms used in the definition derive from English legal tradition, specifically the Treason Act 1351. Levying war means the assembly of armed people to overthrow of the government or to resist its laws. Those who assemble to levy war, as well as those who conspire with them, can be prosecuted.",
