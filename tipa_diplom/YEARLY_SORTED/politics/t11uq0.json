Impossible to say since we don’t have alternate universes to play this out.  We know he didn’t do it durning Trump’s four years in office despite a well known desire, that pre-dates Trump’s term, of Putin to re-form the USSR.  We also know that Putin was planning and staging for this starting only a few months (July) into Biden’s term.\n\nNow I’m sure that this comment isn’t going to be well liked in this sub, but everything above is fact.  It will get downvotes rather than meaningful discussion.  But that doesn’t change the facts.\n\nCriticize Trump if you want, but do it on the facts.",

This is exactly quid pro quo and it was smuggly admitted to on video by then Vice President and now president Joe Biden. Neither Obama nor Biden have been impeached or even forced to account for this action in any way. Hillary Clinton created a chain of false evidence in an attempt to tie Trump to Ukraine and there is evidence that she did so. She destroyed and withheld evidence. This is known as obstruction of justice. Has she been prosecuted or did you turn a blind eye again? Don’t pretend that Democrats are ethically or morally superior in any way, shape or form. Many of you will write this off because you are hypocrites. Many people in this thread accuse others who disagree with you of blind partisanship while blatantly displaying a double standard. I have noticed this to be standard practice for Democrats. Trump was held accountable for everything on the planet from day one on matters from diplomacy to economy. Any time anyone tries to hold Biden accountable for anything it’s,”well, the president doesn’t really have much control over this or that…blah blah blah”. I definitely agree that this president doesn’t have control of much of anything but in general they tend to have a bit of control over many things. I am not a Republican by the way. I am Independent with a slightly broader and more objective view than most of you who are either unwilling or incapable of conceiving of. Why am I bringing this up? The headline of this example of subjective yellow journalism clearly attempts to immediately discredit Trump because he doesn’t fall in the same political sphere as they do. As evidenced by the fact that Trump was found guilty of nothing in a partisan circus that placed Democrats as judge, jury and executioner. They still lead with the impeachment statement to somehow place themselves in a place of moral superiority. This is a feeble attempt at lending legitimacy to a blatantly partisan and biased article. Sadly, it will work for most of you. Democrats are blind to all things that don’t lead to them having unobstructed power and control. I guess the end justifies the means?  Btw, he is absolutely correct that this wouldn’t be happening under real leadership that kept the wolves at bay. Feel free to block me now so you don’t have to consider anything beyond your sculpted reality inside your little snow globe. You could accept reality and do a little research beyond social media and your usual Democrat and Republican mouthpiece news networks. You would find that the World is and has been in a growing state of chaos for a while now partially due to instability in the US. As goes the US , goes most of the developed world.",

Now that Trump's out he wanted to stop further NATO membership in its tracks. Trump is playing Monday Morning Quarterback and offering no strategy except saying it wouldn't have happened if he were in charge, because his base doesn't need proof or evidence as long as they feel like it would have been true. \n\nHis supporters don't realize that they're cheering on the man who would have been the Neville Chamberlain of this conflict. He would have started siding against Ukraine when it was clear Putin was going to take it anyway and make them pinky promise to not take any more land, then wash his hands of it when it escalates and say he kept the US out of a foreign war to cheers at his next rally.\n\nWith so many Republicans and conservatives pundits actively siding with Russia and Putin, I genuinely think the American political landscape will never recover from this. Brutal dictators are seen with more favor than domestic leaders of the opposing party because of how hyper-partisan things have gotten. I don't see how this doesn't result in a physical divide or a new cold civil war.",

Biden has Russian ties just like Donald trump. Stop the fucking division and playing into the hands of what both sides pander to.\nAnd also, Putin invading Ukraine is just as much about control of energy as it is about what Putin says it’s about (reuniting the former Soviet Union). You don’t think it’s notable that Putin took control of Crimea in 2014 with a democrat president which gave him key southern access into Ukraine and waited until the next democratic US president to close the circle in on Ukraine? No, Putin knows the Dems will let him invade Ukraine even if continuing the keystone pipeline project could solve a lot of our problems. You think Putin gives one fuck about climate change?  No, but he knows the far left in our country does. Think.",

Democrats fought tooth and nail to find SOMETHING to impeach him because as Peter Strozck said, and I’m paraphrasing “we have other ways of dealing with Trump if he becomes President” insinuating a coup of sorts. And after a Meuller probe and a Durham probe we found out all of the accusations were not only false but manufactured deliberately by Democrats to undermine the legitimacy of a sitting President. Yet still people today are still spreading fake news about a Trump Russia alliance. And now we have the weakest leader in our nations history and his most inept cabinet ever in power.

He was rightly castigated and impeachment proceedings were begun.  Maybe a month later, Trump provided arms to Ukraine, including sniper rifles, rocket launchers and 150  Javelin anti-tank missiles.  \n\nAs concerns NATO, Trump called them useless because countries were not spending the required $ on military.

He was reluctant to give aid to Ukraine due to its history of internal corruption and Russian antagonism. Unlike his predecessor Obama, refused to give lethal aid to Ukraine. To keep from provoking Moscow. He gave non lethal aid such as night vision goggles, helmets, food rations, etc. When Russia annexed Crimea in Eastern Ukraine. Then President Poroshenko, came to Washington to plead for weapons to defend his country. He addressed a joint session of Congress. Biden, was sitting directly behind him as Vice President. He thanked the US for the aid, but stated “one cannot win a war with blankets.” What is missing in all the finger pointing? Congress has to approve the aid. Not just the President acting on his own taking it out of his stash of cash. \nDecember 2017, the Trump administration sold $47 million worth of Javelin antitank missile systems to Ukraine. On a tweet in May 2018, Poroshenko exclaimed “Finally this day has come! “ In 2019, Congress approved $250 million in lethal aid. \nTrump is right, This deadly situation would never have happened.” If he were still in office. He had all the dictators or wannabes in check. He didn’t make empty threats like Obama. That the use of chemical weapons by Assad, crosses a red line. Assad, used them not only once but 16 times. Trump on the other hand didn’t make empty threats. After an 04 April 2017, chemical attack. He retaliated with 52 sea launched cruise missiles on the airfield that launched the attack. In early Feb 2018, Syrian gov forces backed by Russian mercenaries attempted to capture an oil refinery. They came into contact with American troops stationed there. The troops returned fire and called for artillery and air strikes. Up to 300 or more were killed. Up to 215 were Russian nationals. Trump exuded strength instead of weakness.

Biden is “withholding severe sanctions still” while people are being blown up by Russian troops. He doesn’t give a shit about Ukraine people, he only cares about his shady business dealings being effected. \n\n You ignoramuses who yap like chihuahuas that trump bad despite the fact trump is chilling in his mega mansion in Florida while Biden is taking the reigns of the western world doing absolutely nothing to help anyone anywhere at the expense of innocent lives and a nations sovereignty. Anyone who actually believes trump was serving Putin and Biden is against Putin is an absolute fool since Putin doesn’t care what Biden does since he just does what his incompetent handlers tell him to do anyways.\n\n And all you care about sitting behind your keyboard in a place that I doubt is being assaulted by Russian commandos is poking bad at trump.

Later he \"corrected\" himself, claiming that he meant to say \"wouldn't\" instead of would.\n* Trump suggested the U.S. work directly with Russia on cybersecurity. Trump refused to do anything about Russia's attack on Solar Winds.\n* Almost directly after the 2016 election, Trump sought to weaken U.S. sanctions on Russia, while he was even open to lifting sanctions.\n* Trump dismissed the notion that Putin was a \"killer\", downplaying the idea that Putin resorts to using violence and oppressive tactics to crush political opponents. He defended Putin, rationalizing his ruthless despotism in the process, declaring, \"There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?\"\n* Trump shared highly classified U.S. intelligence with Russian officials in the Oval Office in 2017.\n* Trump repeated Kremlin talking points related to the Russian annexation of Crimea, reiterating things like, \"The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.\"\n* Trump constantly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin. (quite relevant)\n* Trump thanked Putin for expelling hundreds of U.S. diplomats as a retaliation for sanctions.\n* Trump refused to make a statement about the 10th anniversary of the Russia-Georgia war. According to John Bolton, European leaders noticed Trump's silence and \"became even more concerned about American resolve.\"\n* According to congressional testimony, Trump declined to publicly condemn a Russian attack against Ukrainian military vessels in November 2018, even though the State Department prepared a statement for him\n* Trump congratulated and gave legitimacy to Putin's re election win in 2018, a victory said to \"lack genuine competition\"\n* Sergei Skripal, an ex Russian spy that defected to the UK, was poisoned. Sanctions were announced, Trump attempted to rescind them, while asserting that the U.S. was being \"too tough on Putin\"\n* When congress passed new sanctions against Russia in 2017, Trump was very reluctant to signing the bill, and probably wouldn't have signed it if the bill didn't pass with veto-proof majorities in both houses\n* In 2017 it was reported that Trump was considering returning spy bases to Russia.\n* Trump praised and highlighted pro-Russian leaders in Europe. Far right European leaders with close ties to Putin. He even met a Kremlin ally at the Whitehouse.\n* When Trump withdrew troops from Syria, it gave Russia and Putin an opportunity to control abandoned U.S. outposts and checkpoints.\n* Trump froze U.S. aide for Ukraine in it's war against Russian proxies. He repeated Russian disinformation surrounding Ukraine as well.\n* Trump made requests to bring Russia back into the G7 and invited Putin to the 2020 G7 summit",

And so smart. When you see the riots in a country because they’re hurting the Russians, OK, ‘We’ll go and take it over.’ And he really goes step by step by step, and you have to give him a lot of credit.”\n\nApril 28, 2014:\r  \n\r\r\n\n>Putin has shown the world what happens when America has weak leaders.

This was only going to be felt years down the line and this is just the first major instance. Trump was also openly hostile to Ukraine a few times pretty blantantly.

Trump even started testing the waters for no term limits on presidents during rallies, and he received praise for it. There’s no doubt in my mind if trump stayed in office, we would look the other way, as a nation, to this invasion, under the guise of “he’s the only president that doesn’t start wars”. This was well orchestrated. MAGAs overlook the fact that trumps divisive antics, destroying americas camaraderie, we’re extremely beneficial to Russia (and all autocracies). Trump was overly confident in his second term, due to electioneering in 2016, but he was sloppy by shaming democrats for four years. This slop caused many to vote who generally never would.

Oh, that’s wonderful.\n\nSo, Putin is now saying, “It’s independent,” a large section of Ukraine. I said, “How smart is that?” And he’s gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That’s strongest peace force… We could use that on our southern border. That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen.

Trump was very pissed when some NATO countries (Germany specifically) began buying their natural gas from Russia via the NordStream pipeline. Why? Because Germany (a key EU / NATO ally) handed Russia the keys to their breaker box and crossed their fingers that the lights stay on.  \n\nUnder Biden, energy policy has been reversed 180 degrees. Pipelines cancelled. Leases not renewed. In 11/2021, the US alone imported 17M barrels of Russian crude oil. We have intentionally moved away from our position of strength (cuz batteries…or windmills…or turtles…or something).  So what is NATO or EU or USA going to do besides slap Putin on the wrist?

Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated the ICA.”\n\nThe legal and faithful execution of the law does not permit the President or his administration to substitute personal policy priorities for those that Congress has dutifully enacted into law.\n\nThe Constitution “specifically vests Congress with the power of the purse.” and Trump, as well as all other presidents, “is not vested with the power to ignore or amend any such duly enacted law.”\n\nThe faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law.\n\nTrump was dangling military aid to a country under threat in order to have that country announce unwarranted investigation for the sole purpose of having a negative impact on a political rival.\n\nThe lives and security of the Ukrainian people represented nothing to Trump who selfishly pressured a desperate nation to act dishonorably.

Which Putin could do on his own, unprompted.\n\nTo make it seem Trump was effective, all Putin had to do was put off any geo political hanky-panky until trump was no longer president.\n\nAnd now that there’s a Democrat President who has to deal with Putin invading Ukraine, while the agent of chaos former president loudly supports Putin.\n\n2024, the agent of chaos president gets reelected, or someone who’s about as bad.\n\nAmerica and democracy are further disableized, and all Putin has to do is play his long game.\n\nAnd if you’ve made it this far down, Putin, who’s the richest man in the world, doesn’t give a shit about sanctions.  He doesn’t care if sanctions cost him and his oligarchs billions of dollars.\n\nAs real estate agents say, one thing that they’re not making more of is land land land.\n\nPutin knows he can take Ukraine, and more of the now independent former Soviet union states.  In a couple of years everything will be forgotten.  Nordstrom 2 (built starting 2018 while trump was president) will be delivering gas to Germany and money to Russia.  And  the world will have stopped giving a fuck.",
