Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, sponsored companion legislation in the House last year.\n\nBoth Warren bills died in the then-Republican-controlled Senate Finance Committee.\n\nWhat's different now is that Democrats control the Senate, and Warren, who sits on the Finance Committee, has greater leverage to push the bill forward.\n\nNumerous members of Congress have come under scrutiny for their stock trades in recent months. They include Sens. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican; Rep. Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat; and former Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both Republicans of Georgia.\n\nRep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican, went to federal prison last year after pleading guilty to insider-trading charges. But Collins served time for only a few weeks before President Donald Trump pardoned him in December.\n\nTop government officials, Warren said, \"are there to serve the people, not their personal financial interests.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Congress should pass anti-corruption legislation and restore American's faith in government by making it work for everyone ‚Äî not just the rich and powerful.\"\n\nWarren did not offer a specific timetable for when she planned to introduce her stock-trading legislation this congressional session, which concludes in January 2023.",

Hell, not only can they, it is pretty much Yellen's favorite past times these days. \n\nI get tired of hearing Yellen and people like the SEC are there for the people. Anyone who believes the them, get your head out of the sand. A large amount of their regulations do nothing but put unnecessary restraint on retail traders and investors. If I want to put my life savings on 100x leverage on a trash stock, I should be allowed. My money is mine to throw away if I good and well please. If I am trading margin without understanding the risk that carries, that is on me and I promise I will learn the lesson quick. Sometimes you have to burn your hand on the stove to learn not to touch it. \n\nWe also see the government very often take the side of Wall Street, and just keep the vicious cycle going. When retail traders get burned, it's crickets. If the big boys get burned, man the government is quick to start talking about new regulations and to bail them out. Take the Gamestop short squeeze for example. Those big boys do that shit to retail investors every day, but the moment it happened to them, all hell broke loose. All I can say is they are big boys, and they knew the risk of taking a short positions. Maybe they should have been more responsible with their trading.\n\nWe have enough of this manipulation going on from the big players on Wall Street, I would love members of congress and even people in equivalent positions of power in the government to not be allowed to trade. I know I saw a comment that we have seen proof that they have used inside information for their trading. The Federal government's job is to take care of our economy, not to take advantage of it. I believe we also saw it in 2020 right before COVID if I am not mistaken. \n\nSo for once, and I never thought I'd see the day I said this, Warren is on to something.
