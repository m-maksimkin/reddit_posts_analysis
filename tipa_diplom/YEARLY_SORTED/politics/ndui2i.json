He didn't watch thousands of Trump supporters trespassing and storming the steps of the Capitol building, didn't see them replacing the American flag with a Trump flag. He didn't watch people breaking through windows and doors of the capitol. Didn't watch Trump supporters pinning a cop down between a door, while someone shouted \"take his gun and shoot him with it\", the cop reeling and screaming from pain. Didn't watch them smear their shit over the walls, and steal government property. Didn't hear them saying \"We're here for Trump\". Didn't hear them shouting death to Pelosi, Didn't watch a seething mob of fanatics storming through congress looking for anyone to get their hands on.\n\nFor fucks sake, it's a guarantee that if capitol police and secret service inside the capitol didn't do their jobs properly, didn't prevent the mob from reaching congressmen and women, didn't put up last ditch barricades, didn't pull their guns, that the mob would have given any senator or house member a thrashing or far far worse if they actually got their hands on them, including the fucking piece of shit here who is defending them. Oh the irony.\n\nImagine for a moment if the shoe were on the other foot.
