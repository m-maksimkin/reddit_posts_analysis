If the federal government passes a law regulating abortion, the court signaled with this opinion that such a law would be unconstitutional.\n\nSo, no, it's still not the Democrats' fault, no matter how much you wish it was.",

This is exactly what will happen. Because of the filibuster and several democrats that are pro-life, there won’t be anything signed into law. It will be DOA on the Senate floor. \n\n\nEveryone can have all the Hopeium they want on either side of the argument. The simple truth is Roe v Wade is going to be gone. Why do you think the fencing is up around the SCOTUS? They know the Left will riot. They already doxxed many of the Justices. Democrats won’t get anyone to budge on the filibuster. They will also fail at expanding the SCOTUS. I’m not taking sides on this issue. I’m simply being intellectually honest as it’s very clear the way this is going to go. The Left will hate it and the Right will cheer. It is what it is. Don’t shoot the messenger.",

I can’t say I’m a very religious person but I definitely grew up being forced to go to church. It’s weird to me seeing how many people call it murder because of the Bible yet in the Bible it also says that “All animals belong to God” -psalm 24:1 and also “God values everything He created, including animals, and He wants only the best for them.” - Psalm 104:24-25 so it is weird to me that they have no issue killing an elephant for a new wall decor, or even something as simple as a cow for steak. Lastly, around 20% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, and the number jumps to 31% if you add in death prior detection of pregnancy, so why are our efforts not being focused on solving this problem, and is God the one killing 30% of all babies in the world?

            "text": "So many people here are saying that any bill passed will just get shot down by SCOTUS. There seems to be a big misunderstanding here of what SCOTUS does and does not do. SCOTUS's ability to overturn Roe v. Wade is because that is a previous court case. SCOTUS is all about *interpreting* law. Specifically, they can look at a law through the lens of the US Constitution. \n\nThe Constitution says a few things:\n\n1. There are some things only the federal government can do\n2. There are some things only states can do\n3. There are some things both can do, but if they ever conflict, the federal government's policy wins\n4. Neither the states nor federal government can do ANYTHING that breaks any of the rules established by the Constitution\n\nSCOTUS is in charge of number 4, basically. If there is ever a question about whether or not something breaks a constitutional rule, they get to decide. And they can change or revise their own decisions later. But they can only do so through their one lens, the Constitution. They have no say in lawmaking. They are just referees.\n\nRegarding Roe v. Wade. The decision made by SCOTUS in 1973 established that access to abortion was guaranteed based on a certain interpretation that SCOTUS made of specific text in the constitution. However, SCOTUS is free to update their reading or opinion on any past ruling, which is seems they are poised to do.\n\nHowever, if Congress drafts a law which says the same thing and also doesn't break any constitutional rules, SCOTUS can't do anything about it (in theory).\n\nBasically, back to the numbered list above, this is where number 3 comes in. If SCOTUS says there is nothing in the constitution that says that a state cannot ban abortion, then states are free to make their own policies which do or do not allow it. However, if Congress comes in and says that the states aren't allowed to ban it, their law overrules the state law.\n\nAs for what solution is more permanent than any other solution, the answer is none. A law passed by Congress can be repealed by Congress. An interpretation of law or the constitution by SCOTUS can be changed by SCOTUS if the question ever comes up again. And even amendments to the constitution by Congress can be repealed by further amendments to the constitution by Congress. That said, the harder something is to do, the harder it is to undo. In theory, the hardest thing to do in the US is to modify the constitution with amendments.",

There are 'laws' in place that allow me to justify killing this life inside of me that I don't want to have to be responsible for.

            "text": "Why are people making moral arguments against the stances of these politicians?  Why are people commenting that certain leaders don’t seem to care?  Of course they don’t care.  It’s a waste of time to point out hypocrisy as if that’s some kind of zinger that would have any effect upon them.  That’s not what concerns those politicians in the slightest.  \n\nOne advantage that they will always have over the public is that you have feelings about what they cause to happen and they don’t.   It’s not about “how could you?” and clutching pearls.   They do that because that’s the job to them - it’s not about making “hard decisions” because for them it’s about what keeps them in power and profiting.  I mean, we should be angry about it, but maybe take a page from their book about knowing when the negotiations are done - which means: it’s not a question of not showing up to vote anymore. The people saying it’s pointless have been duped and worn down - convinced it’s all hopeless.  That may be easy - assuming a position of helplessness - but it’s childish, and it’s not reality.  \n\nYes, things are hard now.  So many people are just trying to scrape by. Years of bad and worsening education for most people; nationalism styled after religious devotion; and individual exceptionalism combined with devaluation of the worker to somehow convince the public that they are responsible for failing in a system designed for them to constantly be at a disadvantage; and at every turn setting us against each other; so we are too busy, tired, hungry, and scared to blame the people truly responsible for the state of our country. \n\nAnyone who thinks we haven’t been an oligarchy since the beginning is fooling themselves.  \n\nWealthy land-barons who didn’t want to pay taxes they didn’t get any benefit from - who made some general laws cribbed from some of the flawed thinkers of the time (Locke, for example, a slave owner who wrote about “natural rights) to instill reverence into the minds of the people as much as bring order (because they knew very well that the tools they had were the same as those used by religion to influence large numbers of people). A business decision to break off from the control of the king, decorated with flashy banners about freedom - when the freedom at issue was their own, not the people who lived in their territories; but how else could they convince the public to go fight and die for them?  And then states’ rights became important because the big land-owners had their own revenue streams and their own interests that were not the same as the ideals put forth in the national documents.  And so we have amendments that were compromises of their time - the Second amendment being accepted so that wealthy slave-owners could put down revolts from the people they enslaved, and yet worded in a populist and pseudo-patriotic and vague fashion that we suffer from to this day, because it’s easier to argue old theory than it is to make new law.  And the law-making process is inherently conservative - nobody wants to be the first to do anything, which is why real change takes so very long.  See climate change. \n\nThis is how it’s been.  Want something different, or are you content to lie back and whine and stream movies?  Then understand that the other advantages they have over you are a) your learned hopelessness and b) that it’s a few of them and lots of us, which means it’s difficult to get organized and have the actual will of the people presented without passing through countless petty channels that they designed, and maintained by those who are trying to be like the people we want to get rid of.  \n\nAnd another advantage they have is that they get lots of money from lobbyists, so their interest is to put you off as long as possible, take the money, and leave if they get too unpopular.  They have little incentive to work for you.  And that’s what kind of leaders you end up with when the system is based around outside money influence.  Our diplomatic enemies know that they can pump money in to influence the path of the country - we live in that now.  \n\nSo no more lobbyists would be a major step, and publicly funded elections only, and ethics certification as well - and most of the people that are wrecking everything good about this place wouldn’t find it a draw anymore, and go back to sales and inventing new crypto and what have you.  It’s difficult, but it’s not impossible.  Do not be fooled by the sheer volume and intensity of fear- and hate-mongering - even from people you know - that is not statistical data, it’s an impression.  Remember Clinton v. Trump?  Social media presented a false picture of what “the people” think, and still does. \n\nAt rest, most people just want to get through their days and don’t care who marries who or what someone’s choices are - it’s only when they are threatened and scared that these things (mistakenly) become an issue.  So look at who is reporting new things to be scared about all the time. Not just Fox et al there’s plenty of shrill alarmist media focused on the left market too - that’s how they make money. \n\nAnd to be clear - these politicians who blow racist dog whistles all day long?  They don’t care about race all that much - they care about money and influence.  Their contempt and hate is directed at people who are not wealthy, when they think about them at all, and only insofar as it affects their power and wealth.  Racism is a vulgar but expedient device for them - it’s a program, a botnet that they have doing things for them passively.  They don’t need to work up a sweat - you will for them as you (rightly) object to the suffering and inequality, and their true-believer minions will for them as they gratefully accept an available target to blame for their own misery.   And the noise and emotion reduces our bandwidth for fixing the problems.\n\nLet’s just not waste all of our energy on the anger.  Ever arm-wrestle someone? Try doing it without straining every muscle in your body and gritting your teeth and so on, just using the ones you need, and you will find that you will win more often, even against a stronger opponent.  “I’m not tense - I’m just not moving for you.”\n\nAnd the rule is: the wealthy and powerful will continue to do what serves them and not you until prevented from doing so.  Nothing inherently wrong with success or wealth.  But we need a better class of wealthy around here.",

            "text": "I read Judge Alito's answerlast night.  What really got me was when he discussed Casey and the point of undue burden.  \nHe states it's not proven that regulating abortions have not proven to be an undue burden on women. \nStates Casey case did not demonstrate that abortion access would affect a large percentage of cases that are relevant. There was no substantial obstacle here. \n\n\nThen goes on to admit that in general...\nRegulation could affect women's places of residence, financial resources, family situations, work and social obligations,... Psychological and emotional distress and the firmness in the desire to want an abortion.\n\n\nAnd in order to determine if it's a substantial obstacle for women, a Court needs to know which set of women it should have in mind and how many women in this set must find the obstacle to be substantial.  \n\nUh? Answer. The set is every woman of child bearing age. I think any kind of regulation preventing abortion would be an obstacle that is substantial to every single woman in that set that wants to have an abortion. And no woman can predict that for the entirety of her childbearing years she'll be pro-life or pro-choice as an incident like rape, incest, inability to have a child or defamation of a child in utero and more could change their mind. But it's an individual's choice not the voting public as he States later on.\n\nHe says women can vote you can vote your legislators in to change this. So what we're going to have like a change of this law in every state every time the majority flips from Democrat to Republican? \n\nThis was not a Democratic or Republican party line notion, that split down the lines so feverishly until about 1998... Then  really took off in the early 2000s.\n\nEssentially getting rid of roe v Wade and putting the burden back in the States would make a huge obstacle for women all over the United States. By the time a woman has a chance to vote to try and get a legislature change; she could have already had a baby during that time, one that she didn't want to have.  \n\nThe government needs to step back in so many different ways that they have been intruding in our lives in the past few years. It's not up to the government to make personal decisions for us like this. Just like vaccines just like masks they have overstepped their bones and we have been letting them and every single time we give up a freedom we are never going to get it back. It will empower them to take even more. \n\nMuch of the decisions made in this country today are because we allowed for anonymous pack donations and we considered companies the same as an individual when it came to donations to politicians campaigns. Those are two the worst laws made in recent time that have f***** up the country. \n\nRoe v Wade is not going to be the end of this until we can undo the laws that allow for anonymous pack donations and we can turn back the idea that accompanies the same as a person and they can donate as much as they want to a campaign. Until then it's going to be companies hugely Rich nonprofits with very narrow views that are going to be buying all of our votes.\n\nAs it stands,  unless we're all voting in brand new blood with no political connections, we stand no chance to have our vote count in any way. A bought politician does not listen to their constituents, they listens to the donors.  \n\nWithout them they don't have a job. \n\nAnd since most likely we can't undo those two laws we should fight to get a new law made a quick decision vote can be made accurately from the people to recall any politician at any time. And I mean quick as in we don't have to do the petition process and have it validated then go to vote eight months later. \n\nWe've have internet, we have a way to validate that we can turn in our tax forms without much fraud in identity theft.  Then we come up with a voting system where we can log in cast our vote quickly.  Those who don't have internet access can go in show their ID and vote. What's the barrier to get a vote for recall put up I haven't worked that out yet but seriously it needs to be done. And don't let the government tell you that it's not easy they're the ones who don't want this to happen, it is super easy.",

It's been debated for a long time that the notion of the amendments acknowledging unenumerated rights, within our legal system, either protect everything or they protect nothing. An over emphasis on the interpretation of the \"written word law\" makes something as abstract and broad as unenumerated rights stand at odds with the system. The moment any exception or narrowing was made and accepted by the court the precedential logic was in place to undermine any right protected by such broad provisions. And that happened long ago, even before this case.\n\nOur legal system only protected this right indirectly as something unwritten with tinges of privacy right considerations.

Why you may ask well the democrats need a win. And with the striking down of rowvwade it opens up Congress to pass new laws that federally protect the right to an abortion. If this new legislation were to pass it would be a major win to tue democrats and it would give them something to brag about for the coming elections. \n\nNow why did they need the majority opinion to be leaked. This is because as things stand right now the senate would be unlikely to pass anything regarding abortion due to how much of a hit button topic it is.

Any counter argument that does not address the fact is useless. This is why I can tell the left has not listened to the right. If they had there would be arguments constructed that addressed this point. All of this reinforces the gallop poll citing at the right can articulate the left’s positions at a very high rate but the left cannot articulate the right’s positions even a third of the time. \n\nAnother interesting thing is pro life right wing people saying that women who have abortions should not be arrested or jailed. This is a logical disconnect and I believe and out right lie from their true position. If you believe that abortion is murder then you would be happy to see a woman in jail to prevent the murder of her unborn child.  Make no mistake that to enforce an abortion ban some women will be jailed and the right is okay with this. Again, they would view this as preventing a murder.
