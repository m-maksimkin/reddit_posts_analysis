Every single day our politicians sell out the rights of citizens for corporate gain. \n\nThroughout this pandemic, when millions have been affected by a deadly virus, talks of ensuring people have access to healthcare have ceased entirely in the halls of Congress. \n\nAs Republicans waged war on the populace through redistricting and gerrymandering, Democrats are sitting idly by. They have no concern for the wellbeing of their constituents. \n\nAt what point will we, as a country, realize that the people in power - both republican and democrat - don't actually give a fuck about us? At what point do we stop playing the game of 'if you vote, things change' and see the situation for what it is: every 4-8 years, Republicans actively dilute the rights of the citizenry, and when the democrats do finally get power, they sit on their hands doing nothing (at best) or (most likely) seek to exacerbate the situation.\n\nWe can, like the dems, sit on our hands complaining about people like Sinema and Manchin, but until people actually get pissed off enough to do even one goddamn thing about it, those in power will continue to maintain the status quo.",

Our company did have paid sick time for over a year during the pandemic up to 15 days but took it all away. Now, even though I'm fully vaccinated if I were to get sick and test positive I'd have to be home for between 1-4 weeks potentially depending on how severe the illness is. That could be up to a month without any pay or income at a wage just above minimum. Without universal paid leave they are just encouraging people to come to work sick.

Sadly, I suspect this entire practice is designed to force Progressives to oppose this deal, thus giving mainstream dems the ammo they need to continue to oppose Progressives in future elections. \n\nHow many more times do we put up with being told that Manchin and Biden are negotiating the bill, only for the result to be yet another cut? It's evident that the president has absolutely no negotiating power, as he hasn't gotten a single concession from the two holdouts. If he isn't willing to fight for his own bill, we need to stop subjecting the American people to the slow motion middle finger that is this \"negotiation\" process. Just kill the bill and the accompanying infrastructure bill and move on. \n\nProgressives will get the blame, moderates will pretend that this bill would have ever had the potential to pass, and dems will lose Congress next year. That's what happens when you put up with members of your party negotiating in bad faith. \n\nMy only hope is that we see Progressives truly go on the offensive,  calling out the rest of the party,  including Biden and Harris, for not taking this shit seriously. I'm sick of the charade. These are things that Biden ran on,  and we were assured that he was the only candidate capable of getting these things passed. Well,  he can't. He needs to be challenged in the 24 primary. \n\nWe simply can't afford to keep playing politics with this shit anymore. Republicans are on the fast track to fascism, dems NEED meaningful legislation if they have any hope of overcoming the myriad voter suppression laws being implemented in red states. But the current leaders have proven that is something they are incapable of providing. \n\nI'm sick of being promised everything and having the rug pulled out from under me every time. The current Democratic leadership needs to go. The future of the party needs to be progressivism if they want any hope of winning future elections. The only other path is eventual civil unrest after Republicans retake control and start chipping away at your rights.\n\nTake politics more seriously than your moderate representatives.

I was also denied a chance to work remotely from the hospital because \"we're not a company that does that\". I work as a loan officer, and we have an entire group that does lending remotely.\n\nWe have had to turn to donations and fundraisers to keep afloat. Meanwhile, due to having covid pneumonia at the end of last year and many doctors apts for long-covid (hooray for permanent lung damage!) early in this year, I will be running out of FMLA. I will have to go on unprotected personal leave soon. \n\nI sure dont need money to pay my premiums, my $8,500 deductible, the two fucking helicopter trips my son had to take to the children's hospital, or for the 2 month stay this time. \n\nIt's not bad enough trying to fight UMR for every fucking insurance claim, or Cigna for every leave, or my employer to not fucking fire me when my son is in the hospital fighting to stay alive. \n\nNoooo, Joe wants to make sure that everyone knows  he \"fights\" for the average American.

The more public hate Manchin gets over this, the more likely he is to be replaced by a progressive in an upcoming election. We now know it‚Äôs not about having democrats in the senate.
