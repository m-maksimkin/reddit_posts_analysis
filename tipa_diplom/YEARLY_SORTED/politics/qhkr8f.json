Do you know how many billionaires live in West Virginia? The answer is zero. There are no billionaires in his constituency, but he still thought he needed to protect billionaires.

This is not one asshole. It is one scapegoat. Pretty much everyone in Congress short of progressives are actually conservative in nature. They want you can remain rich. They do not want you to have a better quality of life. People like Manchin exist solely to protect the interests of the wealthy benefactors of Congress and prevent progressive or leftist momentum from taking power away. \n\n\nRemember that Elon Musk made $35 billion in one day and complained about the tax bill being unfair to him. 35 billion dollars.

Our company did have paid sick time for over a year during the pandemic up to 15 days but took it all away. Now, even though I'm fully vaccinated if I were to get sick and test positive I'd have to be home for between 1-4 weeks potentially depending on how severe the illness is. That could be up to a month without any pay or income at a wage just above minimum. Without universal paid leave they are just encouraging people to come to work sick.

Sadly, I suspect this entire practice is designed to force Progressives to oppose this deal, thus giving mainstream dems the ammo they need to continue to oppose Progressives in future elections. \n\nHow many more times do we put up with being told that Manchin and Biden are negotiating the bill, only for the result to be yet another cut? It's evident that the president has absolutely no negotiating power, as he hasn't gotten a single concession from the two holdouts. If he isn't willing to fight for his own bill, we need to stop subjecting the American people to the slow motion middle finger that is this \"negotiation\" process. Just kill the bill and the accompanying infrastructure bill and move on. \n\nProgressives will get the blame, moderates will pretend that this bill would have ever had the potential to pass, and dems will lose Congress next year. That's what happens when you put up with members of your party negotiating in bad faith. \n\nMy only hope is that we see Progressives truly go on the offensive,  calling out the rest of the party,  including Biden and Harris, for not taking this shit seriously. I'm sick of the charade. These are things that Biden ran on,  and we were assured that he was the only candidate capable of getting these things passed. Well,  he can't. He needs to be challenged in the 24 primary. \n\nWe simply can't afford to keep playing politics with this shit anymore. Republicans are on the fast track to fascism, dems NEED meaningful legislation if they have any hope of overcoming the myriad voter suppression laws being implemented in red states. But the current leaders have proven that is something they are incapable of providing. \n\nI'm sick of being promised everything and having the rug pulled out from under me every time. The current Democratic leadership needs to go. The future of the party needs to be progressivism if they want any hope of winning future elections. The only other path is eventual civil unrest after Republicans retake control and start chipping away at your rights.\n\nTake politics more seriously than your moderate representatives.

He will be here at least 3-5 more weeks, as they will be doing his big 10+ hour heart surgery on Nov 5. \n\nWe also have a 3 year old at home. He cant be in the hospital due to covid, so my wife stays with him while I stay with the baby. She is working 3 days a week (we cant afford to pay for daycare and our other bills otherwise) but that money is eaten up instantly. I have been unpaid the entire time I've been out. I was also denied a chance to work remotely from the hospital because \"we're not a company that does that\". I work as a loan officer, and we have an entire group that does lending remotely.\n\nWe have had to turn to donations and fundraisers to keep afloat. Meanwhile, due to having covid pneumonia at the end of last year and many doctors apts for long-covid (hooray for permanent lung damage!) early in this year, I will be running out of FMLA. I will have to go on unprotected personal leave soon. \n\nI sure dont need money to pay my premiums, my $8,500 deductible, the two fucking helicopter trips my son had to take to the children's hospital, or for the 2 month stay this time. \n\nIt's not bad enough trying to fight UMR for every fucking insurance claim, or Cigna for every leave, or my employer to not fucking fire me when my son is in the hospital fighting to stay alive. \n\nNoooo, Joe wants to make sure that everyone knows  he \"fights\" for the average American.

I’d rather it be known to the public that the majority of democrats are trying to pass progressive legislation but it’s just one or two people holding it up, rather than have democrats keep gutting this bill to please Manchin and then continue to give the democrats the reputation of getting nothing done. \n\nFor those of us paying attention, yes, democrats are actually trying to get some serious shit done here. But if they keep catering to this guy, the result is not much will get accomplished. And people can say “well we would’ve gotten more but Manchin did xyz so we had to gut the bill”, but at the end of the day, it’s just a classic case of nothing getting accomplished in government, EVEN WHEN the democrats had the majority. \n\nI’m sure many will disagree with this comment but personally I would love to see the democrats really stick their ground, even if it means it delays the bill even further. The more public hate Manchin gets over this, the more likely he is to be replaced by a progressive in an upcoming election. We now know it’s not about having democrats in the senate.
