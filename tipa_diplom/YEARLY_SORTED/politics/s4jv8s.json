I suppose when the government is incapable of doing anything at all, you cannot look to the future, so they must look to the past.  Too bad many voters would rather have more money than hear a bunch of scolding.  The DNC is, again, presenting the GOP with some of the easiest campaigning they'll ever do.\n\nI expect the GOP to mop up during the mid terms and then in 2024 as well.  Sad days ahead!",

First, by saying he made up that conversation at the time to make Trump seem reasonable while the country was still reeling from what happened. In the two weeks after the insurrection, McCarthy likely thought admitting responsibility was going to be good distancing and damage control while also cooling down investigations. But then he realized that Trump and the Republican base *liked* what almost happened that day, and that they would support anyone who kept at what they were there for. That's why he and most Republicans went from shock and condemnation to simultaneously downplaying it and alleging conspiracy.\n\nThat leads me to the second way he'll defend himself, by saying he was still \"emotional\" from the insurrection and \"didn't have all the facts\" about it when he said all that. He'll pat himself on the back for having a knee-jerk reaction to the insurrection by condemning it, but then turn around and say it wasn't all that bad, because now he thinks they were *right* to storm the Capitol. Now that it's part of the Republican narrative that Democrats cheat in every election they win, McCarthy is going to distance himself from this prior distancing, but ride the line between encouraging the people that supported it and claiming no responsibility whatsoever.",
