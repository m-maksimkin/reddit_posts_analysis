The theory was that the way questions about sexuality are worded actually minimize the amount of respondents who say they are not straight.\n\nSo instead of asking people about their preferences, or how they identify themselves, we asked people about their interests. A question like \"have you ever had any sexual interest in a person of the same sex\" had a shockingly high percentage of yes answers at around 25%.\n\nThe thing is interests do not necessarily translate into actions and we actually think that if the participants had been informed that the survey was anonymous, that the percentage would have been even higher.\n\nYou might be wondering what on Earth that has to do with this story.\n\nWell, we kind of came to the conclusion that these hate groups are part of the reason why people don't identify more with their interests.\n\nGenerally people don't want to be hated or be the target of hate groups.\n\nIt's not just hate groups as well.\n\nThe hatred also comes from groups of highly religious people who frequently try to apply their religion to people who don't participate in it.\n\nWhich is exactly what's going on with these bills that are attacking transgendered people.\n\nIt's just so wrong and so misguided on so many levels.\n\nIt's clearly a religious and bigoted attack on American citizens that doesn't solve any problems and creates victims of government legislation.\n\nIt's also a highly unpopular idea for many reasons, one that I explained above.\n\nWhen is the GOP going to stop hating and attacking Americans?",

Fox News and those over on r/Conservative are doing this same garbage literally right now to paint Ashli Babbitt as an “unarmed petite woman who served her country,” instead of as a member of a group of domestic terrorists who was shot and killed while actively trying to harm our political leaders and overthrow our democracy. Reddit drags those types of headlines and people through the mud. This article is praised for doing the same exact thing. The difference is it’s just for someone on our side.\n\n**“*Concerned* father...”** Why was “father” not enough to tell who he was? Once you read the whole headline or watch the video in the article, you know he’s concerned simply because he’s taking the time to give his heartfelt testimony on the topic.\n\n**“... *peacefully* testifying,”** as if providing testimony isn’t usually peaceful, or as if you can’t be arrested while doing something as long as it’s peaceful.\n\n**“[Someone else] before him talked for 40 minutes.”** It’s obvious that this was put into the headline only to incite that at-a-glance assumption that his allotted 2 minutes was unfair compared to the previous speaker’s 40. I’m not saying it wasn’t, but having that in the headline is only there meant to make people *feel* that.\n\nThe article says, *“[R]epresentatives from the...designated hate groups...were allowed to talk for up to 40 minutes and that only opponents of H.B. 1570 were held the the two-minute time limit.”* It never explains *why.* Being a red state, it could absolutely be for bigoted, ignorant, or hateful reasons. But what if it was because those against the bill so greatly outnumbered those in favor, that the only way they could allot the same TOTAL amount of time to both sides, was to give those against it just two minutes each? Again, I don’t know why they did it, but I’m just pointing out that articles like this try to do your thinking for you. By misleading, omitting, and/or being overly descriptive, it puts thoughts in your head while making you believe you came up with them yourself.\n\nThis guy is a lawyer. He’s familiar with rules being in place for a proceeding. He’s familiar with having time limits to present an argument. He’s familiar with the person governing that proceeding to keep all parties in line with the rules and maintaining order. He knew the time limits and he knew he went over them. He was given a 15 second warning. Then he was told twice that his time was up before they cut off his mic. He was told a third time that his time was up. He sat there continuing to speak as officers came to remove him. He is forced to stand up and continues to speak. When the camera is off of him and he’s being removed, he’s likely still giving his speech when he yells something inaudible and is told to relax.\n\nWe all wished this shit would happen to Gym Jordan during the impeachment trials. This guy was brazen in his disregard for the rules and was removed because of it. He was right for being there and saying why he said. But he was wrong in the way he did it. I think people need to understand and admit that being wrong can happen on either side of a discussion.",

White is normal, black is not.  Straight is normal, gay is not.  Christian is normal, Atheist is not.  You do what's expected of you.  Men play football, women are cheerleaders.  You have an American flag outside your house. You do all the things that are \"normal\".  \n\nTheir perspective: By not conforming with this construct, you're not doing your duty.  After all EVERYBODY else has had to swallow their feelings to fit into this oppressive machine - why do trans people get to be special snowflakes?\n\nWhat they fail to realize is that this reinforcement of \"what's normal\" hurts everybody and oppresses everybody from being whoever and whatever they are.",

(I'm new to reddit and not sure if I can post links to them).\n\nThird, here's an update: \n\nMy trial for \"disorderly conduct\" is currently set for late August 2021 in criminal court here in Little Rock; the charge carries a maximum sentence of up to 30 days in jail simply for speaking to my elected officials. \n\nNearly two months later, I am still in shock that this happened. \n\nI served in the US Army from 1993 - 2004, and never imagined I'd be thanked for that service by being thrown in jail for telling elected officials how their hateful laws affect my family, my friends, colleagues and employees in the transgender community. \n\nA bright light needs to be shone on the Republican Party of Arkansas.\n \nState Senators like Breanne Davis, Stanley Rapert, Bart Hester, Trent Garner, Missy Elliot (and quite a few more) are pushing HARD to make it impossible for people who are transgender to live in this state: they make no attempt to mask their hate. \n\nSenator Breanne Davis told me that she was concerned that transgender kids are \"just a fad.\"  Bart Hester thinks that parents are forcing babies to change genders because \"they wanted a boy and got a girl.\" They are out of control, ignorant, and do not believe that every American is entitled to dignity and civil liberties. \n\nThe Arkansas Republican Party is bad news, and there is little investigation done into their backgrounds, their financial relationships with Alliance Defacing Freedom and other hate groups and white supremacy organizations, simply because Arkansas is a small state with little money or national political influence. \n\nIf you have the resources to look into their backgrounds, there are skeletons to be found.\n\nI will keep everyone posted with any major developments, but my focus is on doing everything I can to protect the trans community here in Arkansas.  \n\nPeace,\nChris",

This stance has earned the group a controversial [designation](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/alliance-defending-freedom) as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>***When GOP state legislators began to push “bathroom bills” in 2016 and 2017, it was ADF that*** [***ghostwrote the model legislation***](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/alliance-defending-freedom-lobbies-anti-lgbt-bathroom-bills/) ***and*** [***lobbied for it behind the scenes***](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/law-firm-linked-anti-transgender-bathroom-bills-across-country-n741106)***.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are all astroturfing under a group named [PromisetoAmerica'sChildren](https://promisetoamericaschildren.org/about-us/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9th commandment: Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [article](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/04/short-history-anti-trans-stuff-came-concerned/) lists out the fact these groups were butt-hurt about losing the gay marriage Obergefell case, and now they are bullish on taking rage against the transgender community in retaliation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/anti-lgbtq-coalition-targets-equality-act-name-america-s-children-n1258884](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/anti-lgbtq-coalition-targets-equality-act-name-america-s-children-n1258884)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese horrible monsters are just intent to terrorize people in the name of religion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe worst part is they have a major lobbying group behind them, basically swaying legislators.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***The leader of Focus on the Family, James Dobson*** (whom Mike Pence called his inspirational role model), even started an [astroturf group known as the Women's Liberation Front (WOLF)](https://www.transadvocate.com/fake-radical-feminist-group-actually-paid-political-front-for-anti-lgbt-james-dobson-organization_n_20207.htm) for TERFs to basically make it look like a feminist website, even though he's a white evangelical male. These guys bear false witness and think it's okay because it's about stopping *\"The Queer Agenda\"*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese groups all take as White Christian Nationalist Groups their directions from a leader known as RJ Rushdoony, who came up with the idea known as Christian Reconstruction. It seeks to instill Biblical law into government, creating Christian theocracy. Rushdoony had been quoted in saying many things, such as this quote:\n\n>*Fundamentalist Christians must take control of governments and impose strict biblical law on America and the world. That would mean the death penalty for \"practicing homosexuals,\" among many other \"abominators.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough most fundamentalist leaders now deny holding Reconstructionist beliefs, several — including Beverly and Tim LaHaye (Author of the book series Left Behind & founder of Concerned Women for America), Donald Wildmon (see American Family Association) and D. James Kennedy (see Coral Ridge Ministries) — did serve alongside Rushdoony and other Chalcedon associates on the Coalition for Revival, a group formed in 1981 to \"reclaim America.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese groups have been advocates for conversion therapy, banning of pornography, and have openly stated that LGBTQ+ people are pedophiles that must be stopped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* From James Dobson\n\n>\"The homosexual agenda is a beast. It wants our kids.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* From another group, known as the Traditional Values Coalition:\n\n>*\"As homosexuals continue to make inroads to the public schools, more children will be molested and indoctrinated into the world of homosexuality.* *Gay-Straight Alliances on high school campuses are also part of a plot to \"target children for recruitment\" to gay sex, cross-dressing and sex-change operations*.\"\n\nSo, if you ever wonder who is working behind these bills, look no further than these groups. It's just a bunch of Christian Nationalist organizations that want to instill Christian theocracy onto the United States, making everyone swear on the Bible again. These groups are beyond repugnant, and their stances in the past reflect that.",

You know what We told our son, own your truth love who you are and those that have a problem , that is their problem not yours. We love our son And both my husband and I could not be more proud of him and the man he is. I just feel like all these people that spend so much time and energy , anti-this an anti-that with the LGBTQ could maybe educate themselves and show compassion, empathy and start having conversations with people instead of going out of their way to get involved in bans.  I feel like these are the same people that want less government, yet are the same people that want government in women’s rights, minority rights and LGBTQ rights. Think about that for a minute!",

These people are attacking one of the most vulnerable youth segments there is. Unfortunately it is also the segment with the highest youth suicide rate. https://www.thetrevorproject.org/resources/preventing-suicide/facts-about-suicide/ These people are going to be directly responsible for more kids killing themselves. There is no question about that. Children's blood is on their hands.    \n\n\nI personally believe God and the teachings of Christ. In the last 10 years however I have gone from a supporter of organized religion to believing it may need to be outlawed. It has become a tool for the wealthy to predate on other taxpayers while simultaneously being funded by these same taxpayers. Christ taught a singular message that we are to love each other. These people are massively funded and are working feverishly to do the exact opposite of what he instructed. That is Satan's work then, pure and simple. Now their dangerous ideas are becoming laws. I'm done. From this day forward I no longer support religion and feel it is one of the most dangerous threats we face.
