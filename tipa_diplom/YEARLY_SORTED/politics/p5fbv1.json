Ask the English, Soviets, and now us. After 9/11, they were correct to go into Afghanistan to rout the Taliban, which they did. They were foolish to think they could make the country a democracy, and even more foolish to invade Iraq, which made Iran a regional power. They should have left, or keep a small contingent base behind after several years. 20 years is way too long to keep wasting human and military capital on an impossible task. The people of Afghanistan are just as culpable as they did little to battle the Taliban through this entire mess.",

Biden didn't follow through with Trump's pressure and decided to pull Americans out, when in reality, none of these men established what the end-game was in concrete terms.\n\nThe next time America goes back to the middle east, it'll be to nuke it from orbit, not to hang out and be friends with the Afgans.

Biden was really given three options, go along with the peace deal for the most part (which he took), commit to withdrawal but drastically extend the timeline and risk restarting hostilities with the Taliban, or scrap the peace deal and continue America's decline in reliability on international deals and restart the war in full force. \n\nNONE of these options represented a good choice. The Trump administration had no business making such an important deal at a time when they were not sure if they would even be around to see it through. They could have started the talks, but should have let the next administration finish the talks. I'm not convinced that wasn't intentional, to tie the hands of the next administration and ensure they have a foreign policy mess right out of the gate. Regardless though, it was highly irresponsible.\n\nAll that being said, despite the fact that Joe Biden was in a no-win situation, that doesn't mean that he HAD to go along with what the Trump admin was doing and that doesn't mean there weren't better options. The Biden administration bungled the execution, hands down. Was it inevitable that the Taliban would have taken over? Probably, yes. Was it even inevitable that they would have taken over this fast? Maybe, maybe not, but it should have been seen as a possibility, given what we already knew about the ineptness of the ANA. The administration should have had seen the possibility of the Afghan army surrendering and prepared for it as a worst case scenario. The fact that they were predicting that Kabul would be taken within months, only DAYS AGO, is just a complete intelligence failure. It's just not acceptable for Americans to have to rush out of the capital with no guarantees they won't be slaughtered. The Biden administration owns this execution failure, and I have no problem admitting that as someone who voted for Biden.\n\nIt definitely would have been worse if Trump were still president, but really bad is still really bad, and the fact is that Biden is the one in charge now, not Trump. I hope the Biden administration learns volumes from this mess and figure out what the hell went wrong and fix it. \n\nI also hope he takes a good hard look at his Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense. He shouldn't rush into firings like Trump did, but he really needs to evaluate if this blunder will be good in the long term, as in it is a mistake that will teach these two men volumes and improve their decision making abilities in the future, or if this mistake signals a lack of competence from both or either of them. Joe Biden has too much experience to let something like this happen, so it needs to be the last time he has such a massive foreign policy failure.\n\nI'm glad he's keeping his promises, but the promise is only truly kept if it yields net positive results, which so far it is not.",

First, we can and should get out earlier. Nineteen years is enough, in fact, far too much and way too long. I made early withdraw possible by already pulling much of our billions of dollars of equipment out and, more importantly, reducing our military presence to less than 2,000 troops from the 16,000 level that was there (likewise in Iraq, and zero troops in Syria except for the area where we KEPT THE OIL). Secondly, September 11th represents a very sad event and period for our Country and should remain a day of reflection and remembrance honoring those great souls we lost. Getting out of Afghanistan is a wonderful and positive thing to do. I planned to withdraw on May 1st, and we should keep as close to that schedule as possible.",

And in typical Trump style, the administration left the negotiations claiming they had negotiated a peace treaty and there was peace in the Middle East all because of him etc. Total bullshit, because we know that the ~~sovereign~~ government of Afghanistan wasn’t even involved in these supposed negotiations.\n\nThere are so many things about the last administration that I want more details on, but this is definitely near the top of the list.\n\n\nEDIT: It was pointed out to me in a comment below that there was a complete refusal of Taliban and the Afghan government to negotiate together with the US for years prior to these Trump admin negotiations. Apparently this left US in a difficult spot as we had to negotiate with someone before withdrawal of troops, hence the negotiations with Taliban. I was not aware of this prior to my comment.\n\nThis in no way changes the absurdity of Trumps ridiculous hyperbole and demagoguery about the “success” of the negotiations though.",

They'll forget about things they and Trump bragged about just to score points against Biden.\n\nEvery time the negotiations between the Taliban and Trump administration advanced or broke down, the common talk I heard from conservatives was reflecting Trump's stance, which was \"All we care about is getting our troops out of there\", with some saying we should just bomb everything. Now all of a sudden they really care about the people of a country that they said multiple times before they did not care about, just because they want to make Biden look bad.\n\nIt's hypocritical, it's revisionist, it's disingenuous, and the worst part is it's likely going to work. The GOP base doesn't care about consistency or integrity as long as they make the people they dislike look bad.

Nobody legitimately thought the Afghan government was going to have centralized control over that country. The United States isn't the only country that has been wheeling and dealing with the Taliban to try to make the inevitable as painless as possible. The fact it was Trump seems to matter more than the fact we were trying to negotiate a peace deal with the Taliban. Everyone all over the world should not be surprised that the Taliban was well positioned to slip right into power the minute occupying forces leave.  \n\n\nThe fact of the matter is we couldn't stay in Afghanistan forever, and really should have organized this after Bin Laden was taken care of. If Biden felt that it was such a bad deal, he could have said no thanks and kept the US forces in Afghanistan longer and worked out something on his own. But he knew just as much as the Trump administration knew, and probably just as much as the Obama administration knew in that we'd been in Afghanistan way past the expiration date. Someone had to take a shot in the dark and try to make something of a deal to try to get out as painlessly as possible. Sorry that it was Trump to finally be the one to jump in that pool I guess?  \n\n\nI also don't understand why, if the Biden administration didn't want to do it in May and decided to extend it, they didn't use the extension to slowly get Afghan and US Citizens out of the country over the summer leading up to this date. I mean, if the plan was to just pack up and leave in a matter of weeks, might as well have done it back in May as it was originally drawn up. If they legitimately thought the Afghan government and army was going to hold off the Taliban, then sorry but that's on them.",

Russia left after two years realizing they could not defeat the Taliban. America was there for 20 years and after pulling out it crumbled in mere days. The argument that thousands of soldiers lost their lives for nothing is deeply flawed. They fought a good fight and lives were lost when our leader at the time saw fit to keep them there. After 20 years, how many more lives must be lost for a war for which, we truly do not know why we are there. Osama Bin Ladin was not from there and he is dead. What were we doing there in the first place? What is happening to the citizens of Afghan is sickening but it is a civil war—a war they must fight. I am deeply empathetic for what is happening there. I called crying about the young girls getting raped to a friend, a former Vietnam officer, to which he said: to the victor goes the spoils. Heartless! I exclaimed. We cannot stay in a war because no other leader has wanted to accept the responsibility that it is time to leave.",
