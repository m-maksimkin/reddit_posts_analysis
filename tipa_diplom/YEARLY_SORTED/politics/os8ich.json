One topic was clean coal.\n\n\nIf radical steps were taken to reduce toxic emissions while a FULLY stable alternative was developed and made viable it would make sense.  \n\n\nThe idea that there is enoigh power being made in the next 15 years for each car manufacturer to go fullly electric is misleading.\n\n\nWhere i am we are building a very large dam.   Its been about 10 years.  If everyone in just my province had an electric car we would need 12 more of these dams just to charge the cars.\n\n\nThis isnt even addressing the aging power networks.\n\n\nCoal power plants, ironically, are used at night and the dams are shut down.  It lets warer build, and then the task of firing the coal plant (2 weeks from what ive heard) is avoided.   \n\n\nWe need to keep these power sources in the interim.  Until nuclear, solar, wind, and hydro are more established.",

Those are garbage power producers as solar needs sun and wind needs power this they can't produce 24/7. Nuclear has gotten much much better in recent years. Fukushima was an old plant so no dims you can't count that. \n\nBut dims love regulations and so many regulations that it forces nuclear out the window and is super costly because of regulations.\n\nDims have zero solution to replacing coal and think solar and wind will work when in fact they cannot produce enough energy. But hey, dims sure do know how to raise costs of good and services on everything",

She did this in tik tok, yet nobody is even reporting it.\n\nLooking at the video of her and Biden when she was 8, you can clearly see him feeling around for the nipple and she claims he pinched her and that’s why she moved away in disgust.   This is on video.   This sick mother fucker, to be connected to this sick fuck is like being connected to Satan, it’s not like, it is being connected to Satan.  A drone of his, that’s why there is no outrage, no liberal news media is reporting it, her tik tok was deleted, and now it’s gone, where is the outrage, thats why you cant feel it,  because you are dead and under his control and you willingly gave it to a literal anti Christ, a sick, perverted, mass murderer and spreader of perversions, and he is unrepentant.  He, according to the laws of the Holy Catholic Church is excommunicated.  Automatically, that’s who serious he is.  He can longer receive communion.  He can only enter into the house of God to beg forgiveness and receive the sacrament of confession.  Then he has to show repentance for all the evil he has done and reveal all the sick twisted things he did,  and name all those involved and testify against them using the United States legal system, to rid the grip Lucifer has on the government of the unites states those connected to them.   \n\nHe was denied communion in South Carolina by Christ himself when his Holy Priest turned his back on him.   \n\nWhy, because this priest was upholding the laws of the Catholic Churh, which uses excommunication for a chance of repentance when your crimes and sins are so grave and unholy, and evil, that this is the only way to release the grip Satan has on the person, making him use his own free will to go receive the sacrament of confession and renounce all sin and evil and expose them, to the world.  \n\nJoe Biden doesn’t do this.     He is surrounded by priests that will give him communion breaking the laws of the Catholic Church and of Gods will to try to save that person.   By giving biden communion you are interfering on Gods work, because Biden is not innocent, he is a mass murderer,  a main architect of abortions laws and legislature designed to spread abortion to the poorest individuals in need of the most help in minority neighborhoods mainly black and latinos. to stop them from breeding and have a majority vote and take over the United States government. That is the lie Satan gave him. That is one of the reasons.   In his 40 years in office he has shown no remorse, no repentance, nothing but a spiral towards Lucifers complete control, a unholy apostle of Satan, who is dividing the Catholics around his presence with his satanic charisma and energy, causing Christ’s sheep to gather and run to the wolf, willingly, giving him money, support and votes, going against God, against his Holy Catholic Church, against God, the laws of his Holy Catholic Church and Christ’s salvation. this video, is Satans grip on him, to control him, because he can open the eyes of those connected to him and have them turn on him.   Since this is not happening, Biden is still under the control of Satan.  He has to be denied communion so he can have the ultimate decision, that leaves no doubt on where you stand with, will end up, and why, and that he chose hell, knowing the consequences, and excommunication is Gods way , to try get Biden, because hes Catholic, to stop what he is doing, renounce the evil party of Satan, the Democratic Party, and over God and Christ’s salvation.  Out of his own free will.  So all of Creation will know where he stands.  As of right now he stands with Satan. And he will lose his mind and will forget all he’s done,  and he will go to Judgement,  not even having the remembrance of his sins to be able confess them and save his soul.  \n\nAll the corrupted are being exposed, that includes the priests who are going against the laws of the Holy Catholic Church and giving him communion in an excommunicated state and not informing the public and him if they haven’t of his state of excommunication and why, and it’s abortions that he helped architect in his election in ‘72,  and his total support and influence of the judiciary to get abortion legalized in Roe v Wade in ‘72.   Meaning that he and his co conspirators are directly responsible for over 50,000,000 million abortions, thru lies and deception and corruption, a traitor who has directly orchestrated the American Holocaust of over 50,000,000 American citizens who were denied life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, against Gods very will and the very words declared and written to the world, the british and God, that everyone, has the right to life, liberty, and to the pursuit of happiness, betraying the very foundation of the constitution he swore to uphold.    \n\nHe is a very sick, twisted, evil man who is corrupting Catholics with his evil satanic liberal ideology and dividing the Catholic Church from within.\n\nAs of right now, he stands with Satan, and is refusing Christ’s salvation as he surrounds himself around Catholics whom he has deceived and lied to and corrupted.",
