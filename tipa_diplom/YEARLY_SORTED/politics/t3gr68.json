In the US we are already in a transition phase where this power order is dying a natural death due to age. Leahy himself is a Watergate Baby.\n\nSo respectfully, Sen. Leahy, this has zero to do with Trump. This is about perceived weakness by Putin, Russia's national defense and of course energy because Russia is a petro-state just like Saudi and Ukraine as a shit-ton of energy on the coastline between them/crimea as well as shale reserves.\n\nStrategically from a War Perspective - Ukraine is lost without full military intervention which should be led by Europe. Putin has pretty much just replayed his Georgia playbook. In the US we are going to continue struggling with distrust/lack of confidence in Biden/WH after Afghanistan's FUBAR. Our MIC has been on a bit of diet during Trump's term so I am sure they will gladly work overtime to increase war-products for a Ukraine/NATO borders and to protect/defend Finland/Sweden. \n\nFinland, Sweden and the Baltic States especially Lithuania are extremely vulnerable. \n\nPressure media allies to stop fucking covering Trump, its like feeding a troll.",

But maybe Putin is just a bad judge of timing. Maybe Putin is fucking crazy and maybe he would have done it in 2022 regardless of who. Maybe he didn‚Äôt do it sooner for other reasons. It is silly to see both parties trying to use this tragedy as a political football. I‚Äôm not going to say Trump caused this attack and I‚Äôm not going to say Biden is the reason either. Putin miscalculated and Ukraine under Zelenskyy put up a fight nobody expected. Credit first to them. NATO and US and everybody else is doing the right thing but what choice did they have? I think everybody needs to realize we probably can‚Äôt assume the world revolves around the US President. My bet is that anybody in the Oval Office will be in same hands -tied situation: do we fight a nuclear Russia directly or do we covertly aid and apply economic sanctions? Probably makes no difference who is President in that regard. Both would do the same thing. Trump did want to dissolve NATO but he didn‚Äôt actually do it. He was talked out of it. Also, Trump did assassinate an Iranian general. But I doubt he‚Äôd assassinate anybody now. So who knows how this would go down in another scenario? I think who was the POTUS is maybe 5% a factor. NATO and Ukraine are the key players pushing back and that‚Äôs mostly on the countries nearest to the conflict.  Fuck Putin. But the hero is Zelenskyy and neither Trump nor Biden should get any unwarranted glory out of this. They should both agree that Z needs US support and they should both be saying Fuck Putin.

As tenuous as things are now, we can sleep peacefully knowing that President Biden isn't going to pour gasoline on a fire the way Trump loved to do.\n\nTrump is too stupid to be a Russian agent. But he is either in debt to them, Putin has something leveraging his submission, or he genuinely just has cock envy with Putin. He sees a former KGB leader as a \"tough guy\". That's also very likely because Trump seems to have the education and maturity of a boy in 11th grade.\n\nNobody lives forever. Eventually Putin will not be around. That might not be for another 30 years though. \n\nTrump losing in 2020 was critical for the safety of the world. We can never overstate that.",
