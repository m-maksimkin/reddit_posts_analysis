That turned things into a sunk cost fallacy even after Bin Laden died (in Pakistan, even) and Obama failed to go through a full pull-out because we'd entangled ourselves so deep in Afghan affairs you'd need the jaws of life to remove us properly.\n\nAnd then when we finally do, we ignore that entanglement, fail to read the mood in Kabul utterly, and now we're morally responsible for tens of thousands of Afghans we've screwed over in the transition, including getting them out of the Taliban's way. \n\nIt's been a series of poor decisions. Bush for not keeping on target, Obama for not getting out at an ideal time for political gains, and Biden for botching the exit strategy.

It created a situation akin to Vietnam and Korea where we had invaded a country but because of a large neighboring country giving the enemy military support it was impossible to dismantle their forces. \n\nSay what you will about whether or not Biden or Trump or Obama could have done a better job preparing for an ultimate withdrawal, the end results was predestined to be the same and that original fault lies squarely on Bush’s shoulders.",

He added: “What are we trying to do here? We didn’t have the foggiest notion of what we were undertaking.” \n“If the American people knew the magnitude of this dysfunction . . . 2,400 lives lost,” Lute added, blaming the deaths of U.S. military personnel on bureaucratic breakdowns among Congress, the Pentagon and the State Department. “Who will say this was in vain?” \n\n\nOr Donald rumsfeld complaining that he doesn't know who the enemy is. \n\n“I have no visibility into who the bad guys are,” Rumsfeld complained in a Sept. 8, 2003, snowflake. “We are woefully deficient in human intelligence.” \n\nRyan Crocker on corruption in the Afgan Government \n\n“Our biggest single project, sadly and inadvertently, of course, may have been the development of mass corruption,” Crocker, who served as the top U.S. diplomat in Kabul in 2002 and again from 2011 to 2012, told government interviewers. He added, “Once it gets to the level I saw, when I was out there, it’s somewhere between unbelievably hard and outright impossible to fix it.”\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/afghanistan-papers/afghanistan-war-confidential-documents/",

            "text": "There are two separate events here that should be addressed. The first is the Fall of the Afghan State. The second is Saigon 2.0. While linked, they should largely be discussed separately as one is a consequence of long-term US foreign policy and the other short term policy. \n\nThe fall of the Afghan state falls on the shoulders of every US president since Bush. It also falls on the shoulder of every Congress since 2001, as they all had a responsibility to oversee the execution of US policy in Afghanistan. We threw away boatloads of money fighting this war without much oversight. Those in power go rich off of American dollars that were meant for the Afghan people. We allied ourselves with the same Mujahdeen and warlords whose oppression led to the rise of the Taliban. The first President of Afghanistan is basically a Taliban, and his position was largely influenced by the US because the US did not want Mohammed Zahir Shah back on the throne. One thing is for certain, Mohammed Zahir Shah did not have Taliban sympathies. Secondly, we know that Zahir Shah was a modernist and modestly westernized. Thirdly, he had legitimacy outside of being an American puppet. For all of this, the Bush Administration can take the blame. The Obama administration deserves some blame for the bloated Afghan Nation Army. Their army numbered around 85k I believe and the Obama admin wanted that number tripled. If the government couldn't train 85k good troops, then there really isn't a point in making an army of 300k. Its just more resources being thrown together for the same poor result. You might as well burn the money. And surely the Obama admin knew this, because we've heard the grumblings of American military personnel for at least a decade about how ineffective the ANA at large was. The Obama admin gets both credit and blame as they pressured the country to remove the first puppet, who was corrupt and as I said before, basically Taliban (though it might not have been known then) but it doesn't appear from the evidence did anything else to try and make the new administration be less corrupt. Trump, as I will mention below gets blame for dealing with the Taliban. Other than that, I'm not sure of the specifics of Trump's Afghanistan plan because that administration was just a whirlwind of fucked up news. What is quite apparent is that the Trump admin did not pursue, or at least not successfully, a policy of jealously tracking American funding, training and state-building. To a large extent, the reason everybody deserves blame, including Congress (whom I might remind everybody authorized the use of military force in Afghanistan and continued to do so for the entirety of this war) is that we never actually pursued a policy of state-building. We just threw money at the problem in the hopes it would go away, while trying to build propaganda success stories that nobody would follow up on because nobody actually gave a fuck. \n\nSaigon 2.0 falls exclusively on President Biden's shoulders. Nobody held a gun to his head and told him to execute the evacuation in this manner. He doesn't get to shake off blame by claiming to not know the Afghan military would collapse the way it did. It was his job to gather accurate information on this matter and use that information to formulate a plan that would allow an orderly evacuation of American personnel and their Afghan allies. Instead, we got Saigon 2.0. I simply ask, why couldn't the US complete its mission of evacuation of civilian personnel, both American and Afghan, before removing all of our military personnel? Why did we have to send more troops into Afghanistan than were there when Biden took office? I just don't understand how somebody can rationally look at this situation and say this was handled well? Congress doesn't share the blame here because it wasn't Congress' policy. The President pursued this policy on his own. And even if Congress' refusal to override this policy is taken as a consent to this policy (as I have done above with regards to each Congress that succeed the Congress of 2001-2003) the policy itself was not a bad policy. This is a pure failure of execution and execution alone, and that fall squarely on the shoulders of the current administration, whom is responsible for the execution of policy. Anybody blaming Biden for losing the war is a fool. Its obvious the war was being lost before he came into office. Anybody saying he isn't the blame for the Saigon 2.0 scenario playing out is also a fool, if they believe this in earnest, else they are a partisan. \n\nAs far as I can tell, we were basically at the mercy of the Taliban. Had they opted to storm the city, it appears they could have turned this into a hostage situation. \n\nNow, somebody is going to come in and say Biden was just executing Trump's plan, or a modified version of it, or just in some way bring up the Taliban-Trump deal. Firstly, let me state unequivocally Trump should never have held talks with the Taliban without the Afghan government. We should not have released thousands of Taliban back into the country. Ultimately however, my critique of Biden should not be seen in any way as a praise of Trump or of the Republicans (I loathe them both). I am critiquing Biden for falling short of my own standards I hold a president to, not as a comparative exercise. He was not required to execute Trump's withdrawal. Regardless of the position he inherited, he most certainly did not make the best of that situation, and quite frankly, didn't even execute it well. This was a failed administration of policy, pure and simple, even if the reasons that execution failed may be complex. \n\nThis weird defense of Biden and effort to backwards blame shift to distract from what the current administration has done and is doing is blatantly partisan.",

When you are at war in their conditions, you want them to settle down and sit and talk and be more negotiators politicians. Now, that they have won, they have a lot to lose. So, risk will go down. Afghanistan is a mix of tribes and they need to sit down and talk. For them, Afghanistan is a concept. They don’t even feel from the same country. There is no country. If they build the Caliphate, you have a structure in one place and you can concentrate. Of course, my thoughts for a penny. The 9/11 people is gone. What we have now is a political force that might constitute an Emirate Country. That is what they want and we can not tell people how to run their countries. Twenty yrs of war speaks by itself. The will to form a country was not there and they faked the whole thing to get the US money. There is no other way to explain why 300,000 people quit against 75,000 people.

Carter was running for reelection and wanted to appear tough, so, we gave USSR her very own Vietnam, and we got in return 9/11. The Communist government of Afghanistan didn’t persecute woman, or destroy art treasures, or allow its soil to become an anti-American terrorist base of operations for Al-Qaeda. We should learn to mind our business. Jimmy Carter was a geopolitical disaster, easily manipulated by David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger, both of whom were the real cause of the Iran hostage crisis. \n\nThe unpopular war contributed greatly to the USSR suicide… which I am still not convinced was a good thing. Gorbachev was a democrat and tried his best to covert communism to democratic socialism. I think the world would have been a better place had he succeeded. The world would certainly be a better place without the evil Taliban. \n\nAfghanistan policy for 42 years has been about international arms sales. Too bad so many people had to die so that dealers and their bankster partners could get richer. US spent $2 trillion (that we know about) in 20 years. Plus, NATO threw in considerable resources.

Just kidding, he said that the buck stops at his desk and is taking responsibility for the fuckup because it happened under him.  Sure as shit wouldn't hear that from the last guy; he would've blamed Democrats for impeaching him and impeding on his focus cuz he can't multitask, but moving on...\n\n\nThat being said, the Biden administration isn't the reason why the Taliban took over so easily.  The last four administration's military leaders spent 20 years teaching Afghans how to fight against the Taliban, but we ended up doing the heavy lifting to flex our firepower.  Teaching them to use OUR technology, OUR intel, OUR weapons, OUR fleets, OUR aircraft, and OUR method of fighting the Taliban, not theirs.  The Taliban isn't a bunch of \"sand people with guns\"; they're seasoned fighters now that have been fighting the U.S. Military for 20 years.  Read that again.  The Taliban are trained to fight against the U.S. Military by experience.  The Afghan government was trained to fight against the Taliban **with a handicap from the U.S. Military**.  Take the U.S. out of the equation and wouldn't ya know?  The Taliban runs roughshod over the Afghan government in a single month because the Afghans can't fight without the United States being in front of them.  \n\n\nThere's a lot of finger pointing going on and lots of frustration over how quickly this turned.  Seems reactionary to me.  Both sides are to blame and all four administrations share the blame.  I mean, I'd be frustrated too if I spent twenty years training someone to fight my long-time opponent of twenty years, only to be knocked out in the first minute because it was their first fight without kiddie gloves.  All the money pissed away, time wasted, soldiers sacrificed, limbs lost, families broken, mental health crises and effort gone in one month. \n\n\nNobody wins in a war, except weapons manufacturers.",

After all, from the 1930s to the 1960s, Afghanistan was a vacation spot for some and women in Afghanistan enjoyed a large dose of progress in the social and economic spheres of life. But the threats to that progress were always there and the bulk of those threats had nothing to do with outside powers. Natural divisions in Afghan society are also to blame for the situation in the country (urban/rural divide, religious views, limping economic development). \n\nAnd, of course, there is the idea that Afghan people are tired of fighting. They have stopped caring who rules them - neither Karzai, nor Ghani really did anything for them (at least in the minds of many Afghans). They just want the bloodshed to stop.",
