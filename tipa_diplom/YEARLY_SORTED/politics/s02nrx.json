Props to the 70+mil real votes. That's legit. But not one time in the 2 years since covid did I see a single supporter get pissed off when Trump literally diverted PPE in the early stages of Covid **away** from blue states. There are Republican voters I know personally that **were laughing when they read that**. This is what I mean. They actively cheered hurting only blue states. Republican voters in this very subreddit were actively defending the actions, too). I just don't know if I can trust Republican voter intent ever again. I gave it a debate chance (never a voting chance) and it still failed me.\n\nRemember this famous doozy? ***\"He isn't hurting the right people\". Case in point.***\n\nBut, that's exactly why it *should* be popular because it's **literally** *only* going to effect people who are currently already powerful and any future members of said powerful entity. Not 1 every-day person (no matter what side you are on) will feel any effect of this.\n\nThe problem itself is a very very unethical one and an extremely advantageous one. They have the power to craft, pass, etc. laws of any kind. Those laws can have a direct impact on the very stocks they are allowed to buy/sell.\n\nThat entire concept is at odds with itself.\n\nWhich means this ***should*** be something **everyone** would want to team up to tackle.\n\nEdit: If I did not clarify, what I mean is: voters on both sides should easily get behind a law that prohibits members in office from buying and selling stock. As, the only ones it will effect are going to be literally just the people in office. Which will piss off both sides **in** office.\n\nNot out of it.\n\nAnd that Republican voters these days seem to only want to vote for anything that hurts Democrats, but not them.",
