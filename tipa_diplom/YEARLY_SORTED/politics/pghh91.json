The entire point is the chilling effect the spectre of being sued has on abortion. They could attempt to sue zero people and this law will have its intended affect. \n\nThat is the point of laws like this, even when they are totally unconstitutional. They cause people to stop doing the action for fear of the law, not because they will be actively sued. \n\nRepublicans are doing this all across the nation currently, I live in KS and we have a law going on the books that says basically \"anyone collecting ballot applications to turn in and is confused as an election official will be charged.\" No one has been sued yet, it isn't even in full affect; but every college campus registration drive has been cancelled for fear of running afoul of the law. Their intended goal is already being achieved and the law hasn't even been put into affect and no one has been charged. They are getting what they want - fewer voter registration drives which are more likely to be to register a dem than a repub.",

I certainly understand the need for a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body.  I choose this as well and I’m a man.  I’m just as guilty as I have been involved in two abortions.  I wonder what would have happened to them if we had kept them instead.  God holds me accountable and although sin is a sin, murder is not something I can take lightly.  I pray for forgiveness daily.  If you’re not Christian, it may not matter to you.  But remember, this country is A Godly country or at least our forefathers intended it that way.  On each coin reads “IN GOD WE TRUST”.

If the right people had found out, I would’ve been kicked out of my school - I had seen people get kicked out for way less - I would have lost all my scholarships, been booted from my sorority and lost my degree. My partner could’ve left me (luckily he didn’t believe the ex and also, ya know, didn’t care if it was true). The amount of strife it would’ve caused in my family having to explain the reason I was expelled would’ve left me homeless and destroyed my family life, because there would be no “proof” that I didn’t have one. \n\nAnd this was in 2009. I didn’t have to worry about legal repercussions. I didn’t have to worry about having a record. \n\nThis bill is so dangerous for women. They will become the target of jealous exes, narcissistic parents, competitive coworkers, bosses who didn’t like they asked for a raise...the implications for how this is a set up to destroy the lives of thousands and thousands of women/girls, and that doesn’t include the lives of the women who can’t get abortions when they need/want them...",

If the heartbeat is detected, then the abortion is prohibited. A heartbeat is generally detectable around six weeks of gestation. The Texas Heartbeat Act will take effect on September 1, 2021.\n\n>Any abortion performed in violation of the Texas Heartbeat Act is a criminal offense, and any individual or entity that aids or abets an abortion on a child with a detectable heartbeat in Texas is violating the law as well. This includes: (1) Abortion funds that provide financial or logistical support to women who kill their unborn children after a fetal heartbeat is detectable; (3) Doctors or medical personnel who provide abortion referrals after six weeks of gestation; and (4) Any other individual or entity that aids or abets an illegal abortion in any way.\n\n>#*The Texas Heartbeat Act is unique because it calls upon private citizens to hold abortion providers and their enablers accountable. Any person can sue any abortion provider who kills an unborn child after six weeks of gestation—and any person can sue anyone who aids or abets these illegal abortions. All of these individuals must pay damages to the person who sued them of at least $10,000 for each illegal abortion that they perform or assist.*#\n\n>Texas Right to Life will ensure that these lawbreakers are held accountable for their actions.

Don't use automated scripts to write the fake reports. Even if they're done pretty decently, this will make it way easier for them to filter things out. It could be from massive influence of reports at certain times, common patterns in language uses that the script writes, etc. Basically, they're easy enough to detect that it will only waste a little time assuming they have at least a few competent tech people behind the scenes.\n\nDon't use names like Ted Cruz or Trump or anything like that. Even I could filter that shit out of a database. Even if they don't have the best help over on the backend, they'll still Barely even be annoyed by something like that regardless of how many reports come on with those names. It barely takes any effort to remove anything with the word Trump in the name field from the database.\n\nMost importantly, you have to make them sound plausible. Now, don't give anyone's real name, that could lead to them getting harassed, death threats, lawsuits, etc. What you need to do is get a random, but not obviously fake name, and description.\n\nTo repeat, the thing that will do damage isn't a large volume of fake reports, it's reports that can't be reliably deemed as junk data. There are plenty of tools to mitigate or negate the effects of DDOSing and hacking the website, but an effectively poisoned dataset has no easy fix.”",

Brief summaries:\n• A pregnant woman who is injured and aborts the fetus warrants financial compensation only (to her husband), suggesting that the fetus is property, not a person (Exodus 21:22-25).\n• The gruesome priestly purity test to which a wife accused of adultery must submit will cause her to abort the fetus if she is guilty, indicating that the fetus does not possess a right to life (Numbers 5:11-31).\n• God enumerated his punishments for disobedience, including \"cursed shall be the fruit of your womb\" and \"you will eat the fruit of your womb,\" directly contradicting sanctity-of-life claims (Deuteronomy 28:18,53).\n• Elisha's prophecy for soon-to-be King Hazael said he would attack the Israelites, burn their cities, crush the heads of their babies and rip open their pregnant women (2 Kings 8:12).\n• King Menahem of Israel destroyed Tiphsah (also called Tappuah) and the surrounding towns, killing all residents and ripping open pregnant women with the sword (2 Kings 15:16).\n• Isaiah prophesied doom for Babylon, including the murder of unborn children: \"They will have no pity on the fruit of the womb\" (Isaiah 13:18).\n• For worshiping idols, God declared that not one of his people would live, not a man, woman or child (not even babies in arms), again confuting assertions about the sanctity of life (Jeremiah 44:7-8).\n• God will punish the Israelites by destroying their unborn children, who will die at birth, or perish in the womb, or never even be conceived (Hosea 9:10-16).\n• For rebelling against God, Samaria's people will be killed, their babies will be dashed to death against the ground, and their pregnant women will be ripped open with a sword (Hosea 13:16).\n• Jesus did not express any special concern for unborn children during the anticipated end times: \"Woe to pregnant women and those who are nursing\" (Matthew 24:19).",

AND if they lose the case, they dont have to pay any attorney fees for the winning side.\n\nI mean why not? bigotry in business is actually illegal, unlike abortions.\n\nand of course due to the idiocy of standing and the fact our courts are NOT proactive, a corp actually has to get damaged by this law or have a high threat of damage from this law  to sue against it. and the only way you could have a high threat from this law, is if you ran an inherently bigoted company.\n\n\nthere is good reason why fascist nations tended to involve citizen police. and why no modern civilized nation thinks that is a good idea.

The majority of major companies and public organizations lean pretty clearly to the left. There is a majority left senate, house, and executive. So here is my question to Reddit, are the polling numbers about Americans supporting right to choice just fluffed up by liberal media? If there is anything I’ve learned from the 2016 and 2020 elections are that Republicans and their issues are always seen as an after thought by polling organizations until they aren’t. Examples include both of Trumps turnouts in the last elections. Also people are acting like we don’t live in a democracy, if there is one thing Reddit has shown all of us is the ability to unify as a powerful collective for the change we want to see. Maybe I’m crazy or is the reality just that a lot more Americans than we thought find abortion immoral and not fit for our society? (Just so people get a feel for where I lean, I am a big pro choice dude but a lot of my family isn’t but they respect me and my beliefs.)",
