I thought body-autonomy was something this lot on here cared about.  We are talking about the federal government more or less compelling non-consenting adults to allow them to inject a substance into their bodies against their will... or else lose everything.  Even given that the vaccine is safe, effective, and necessary, does that not set a frightening precedent?\n\nWould most of you be comfortable with, say, the next Trump administration having the power to *compel* you to be injected with whatever the next GOP administration deems necessary?

There are lots of truck drivers saying that they would leave their jobs if forced to vaccinate. The country is already experiencing huge trucking shortages, the industry has a shrinking, aging workforce despite growing demand, and the majority of trucking is owned by major fleets, meaning the majority of truckers would be effected. This would result in massive amounts of early retirements, and folks leaving big fleets to join smaller businesses to avoid the mandate. \n\nThis could exacerbate every shortage we are already experiencing nationwide.\n\nAre private firms just going to break up into multiple smaller ones on paper to get around this? Will commercial driving become owner-operator dominant again? (Probably not). Will we see a boom in small businesses as people actively seek out sub-100 employee businesses to work at?\n\nI am 100% for everyone being vaccinated, but can someone talk me through how this gets effectively implemented in conservative industries?",

We are almost at the 20th year anniversary of 9/11, why in that time are we not concerned about giving the government the power to mandate what individuals do concerning their healthcare? After 9/11, a truly scary event, we gave so many powers to government to spy on us, have secret courts, extraordinary rendition. Generally, just how out of control everything got. \n\nI can see it as being laughable, *\"Vepper, It's for a deadly pandemic. Why shouldn't the government concern it's self with the health and wellbeing of the country, especially when there are so many holdouts?\"* ...and I would normally agree. I'm concerned that once this genie is out of the bottle who's to say that there won't be further mandates in regards to public safety. Why not force all teens take Gardasil? All men in the US have to sign up for the draft, why not mandate that they take a cocktail of vaccines as a readiness measure? Maybe think about a conservative Supreme Court (and what they let Texas get away with) could do with a Republican Neo-con? Once we allow this kind of power, they won't give it up and I don't we should allow the next Raytheon/Goldman sacs/Black Rock/Nestlé/Monsanto/GSK president to have that kind of pull.\n\nEdit: I know a few people that don't want to get the jab for a variety of reasons. I would like them too, I'm concerned about their health and wellbeing. **Getting the shot won't prevent you from getting sick, just not dying from it**. Maybe forcing it is the only way since this whole thing has been mishandled and this is a grasping attempt to have an appearance of control. Once Mu come into play or god forbid, it crosses over with delta. We could probably see the body count rise like it did last year and the long covid symptoms will get everyone.

Traditionally, we consider people like that immune.  They now have antibodies (which is the whole point of the vaccine).    So what's going to happen with them?  If  I can't count the antibodies my body made to fight off the disease, why would antibodies made due to the vaccine count?  At that point, why even get the vaccine if the antibodies don't count?\n\nBefore you make assumptions, I am vaccinated.

The article says mandate is done to stop the spread. How will it stop if you can still spread it after vaccination?? Anyways this decision is going to give heartburn to lot of people.

Can we seriously not see that people shouldn’t be forced to take an injection just to find employment??!! Whether you are for or against the vaccine itself that doesn’t matter, what does matter is that the choice is being taken away from us. Take me for example, I have an underlying heart condition and so am much more likely to die from the vaccine than I am from covid, and I’m supposed to just be quiet and take it anyway just to be able to work? Yeah the vaccine probably won’t kill me but at least I should have the right to choose not to take it if it involves more risk to me? Let’s also not forget the fact that this vaccine is essentially useless, people are still receiving and transmitting the virus after getting the vaccine, this same vaccine that has killed multiple otherwise healthy people, but if it’s so ineffective then why on earth are we literally forcing people in a plausibly deniable way so as to take this dangerous vaccine THAT DOESNT EVEN WORK? I’m sorry but some people just can’t see what’s happening right in front of them. I’ve personally been mocked by so called friends, refused service and been isolated from others as I literally can’t go out anywhere with my actual friends anymore… all because I have an underlying heart condition and wont take a vaccine that has not gone through the proper development protocols, was essentially fully developed and distributed within a few months, didn’t even include a control group in Pfizer’s official research (like wtf?) and to top it all off isn’t even nearly similar to your typical vaccine, you can barely even call it a vaccine. This isn’t an anti-vax thing, this is specifically anti-this vaccine as it is barely even passible as a vaccine anyway. Also ask yourself, since there are already some pretty serious short term side effects, what could the long term effects of this be?

This is sort of bad.\n\nWe might be able to eat a 14,000 a day fine tho. It is only 5 million dollars. Or not, we would probably go bankrupt and shut down the USA operations for at least the time being. Unemployment it is I guess lol.",

President Biden is truly pushing the boundaries and limits of what the American population is willing to stand in regards to federalism.\n\n\n\nThis country was founded on revolution, and has been through a Civil War when many states disagreed with the federal government.\n\nBiden himself said 100 million people are unvaccinated. Depending upon how deep these views are, that is more than enough people to start a country, more than the population of many, many countries.\n\nAnd the issue of forced vaccination is a deeply personal one to some people, they liken it to forced abortions, or forced sterilization. It is in essence, by depriving people of the ability to feed their family or put a roof over their head forcing them to inject something in their body they do not want.\n\nA Civil War over something like this would not unify the North like slavery did. I would argue a good deal of Americans would not be willing to literally shoot and kill their brothers and sisters that were uncomfortable putting a brand new medicine into their body.\n\n\nEdit: Another question I have, is I wonder what percentage of the unvaccinated already has antibodies through prior Covid? I have received vaccination, and have had Covid, I know many people that feel like since they have had Covid and have the blood test to prove they have the antibodies they shouldn’t have to get two shots of the vaccine.\n\nEdit 2: I also find it odd, since he is trying to stretch the limits of his authority and literally require anyone that the federal government has the power to to be vaccinated, why did he not force people receiving government assistance to be vaccinated? Statistically speaking they are more likely to spread the virus among each other since they live in closer quarters, and if they are requiring everybody that works to get vaccinated it’s only fair to require everyone that receives government assistance to be vaccinated.",

This allows Congress to be subverted by using already established laws.\n\nOSHA has the authority to establish rules for how workplaces must protect workers at work. While This is an Federal OSHA rule, expect to see those States that have their own “OSHA” plan (CA, OR, WA, AZ, HI, UT, etc.) to follow along with this rule. \n\nFor those who may not know, about half of States have their own “OSHA” departments and administer their own rules. For this to be allowed, the State must get Federal approval. In the end of the day the Federal OSHA sets the minimum standards that every other plan must at a minimum meet as well. \n\nThe penalties state that there is a $14,000 penalty. This is for “serious” penalties. This does not include companies that blatantly say “screw that we aren’t following this”. Companies that willfully violate this rule are subject to a “willful” violation which carries approximately a $135,000 penalty per violation.\n\nIn short a company with over 100 employees that has 20 unvaccinated employees that blatantly says “we aren’t following that” are subject to a fine of $135,000 per unvaccinated employee per shift. \n\nOwners and executive leadership that are responsible for deciding to blatantly disregard this rule can be criminally charged and sent to prison for a plethora of reasons. This single provision will be why most companies will follow this rule. It is similar to not following federal financial rules.\n\nAt the end of the day, NOTHING has actually been instituted yet as the official rule has not been written or published. Expect this to be enacted within the next couple weeks with a deadline to comply sometime before the end of the year.\n\nWhile States like GA and TX are guaranteed to sue over this, realize that most of these 100+ employee companies also reside in States where this will be a State “OSHA” rule. These companies will make a blanket policy to follow this rule.\n\nThis is only my take on the OSHA rule portion of this announcement. \n\nPlease feel free to argue or ask questions, this is my personal interpretation as a CSP and PhD Candidate in Occupational Health and Safety.

My ex was a victim of the lockdown policy of the \"convalescent\" home she was in after a series of strokes. They banned my son's weekly visits and she stopped eating.\n\nThe only label for this whole thing is genocide by any other name still is. Goebels style.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n> The Biden administration is requiring employers with more than 100 employees to mandate vaccines or weekly testing - a move that will impact more than 80 million workers.\n\n> That plan includes vaccine mandates for federal employees, contractors of federal agencies, and staff at all healthcare facilities that receive federal funding from Medicare or Medicaid.\n\n> By introducing new mandates, and making it harder for federal workers to skirt existing ones, Biden hopes to counteract the Delta variant&#039;s prevailing threat in the US. The variant now accounts for more than 90% of COVID-19 cases in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/pl6kqr/biden_to_announce_requirement_for_employers_with/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~597319 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **mandate**^#1 **more**^#2 **federal**^#3 **Biden**^#4 **tested**^#5",

We've been really \"kid gloves\" at handling these people, but what if this shit drags on for YEARS all due to their own failures of personal responsibility? I mean in this very country it's a crime to let someone die through your own actions, say you knew someone who was blind, and was going to open a door to a lion's cage and you didn't shout \"don't open that!\". It's negligence. When are we going to start charging these people for negligence? These people aren't going to change, and they will continue to either die or take out people with them, and once they DO die from it, they won't be around anymore, so it's not like they give a shit either way.\n\nAustralia didn't have one new case for what, like 270 days?

Unless there’s a vaccine that prevents you from catching covid all the vaccines and booster are never going to stop it.

I know the science and I admit that I should have listened to my own intuition, however, I digress. \n\nAt any rate, I'm not sure how POTUS can mandate (via E.O.) a vaccine that is STILL under an EUA. Yes, I stated that correctly. If you read the 8/23/2021 FDA letter regarding the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine \"which is not an FDA approved vaccine\" it clearly states that this vaccine (aforementioned) is the same as the newly marketed COMIRNATY vaccine which has not yet gone to production and therefore not in stock. So legally, and the FDA again spells this out in that letter, the provider of the vaccine MUST still provide to the recipient of the non-approved vaccine, information \"consistent\" with the Vaccine Information Fact Sheet (insert) that comes with each vial. So COMIRNATY is \"future\" use as legally implied by the FDA. The reason: there still isn't sufficient data on the long term issues associated with the non-approved vaccine. In that sense, Pfizer remains legally in the clear since the non-approved vaccine currently in stock and being provided to the general public/ government employee and contractors is still in fact under an EUA. \n\nIt's all a legal word-play. I see this issue being played out in the courts as both the E.O. language along with the FDA language make clear that the current non-FDA approved vaccine in use is still in fact an EUA vaccine.",

Jacobson v Massachusetts established that government has the authority and responsibility to enact vaccine mandates to fight a pandemic, even at the expense of some individual Constitutional liberties. But to date all such vaccine mandates have been at the state level, not federal, and it’s never been tested in court whether the federal government has jurisdiction to implement a nationwide vaccine mandate or if it has to be done at the state level.\n\nMy guess is that the federal mandate will hold up since courts have recognized OSHA’s authority to regulate workplace safety nationally and because there is a decent argument that a national vaccine mandate may be necessary to properly secure the safety of interstate commerce and travel which is a federal prerogative.  That’s just a guess though, we’ll find out soon enough I guess since it’s pretty much guaranteed that the anti-mandate crowd will sue. 🤷‍♂️",

Also i see some articles that say covid vaccines protect against the delta variant, with that being said, if the vaccines are effective against covid 19 and this delta variant why do we keep seeing spikes in cases? I saw a figure that said around 50% of adults in the U.S are vaccinated, if this virus is THAT deadly and contagious among the unvaccinated, not to sound edgy or anything, but shouldn't the problem in a sense ya know \"fix itself\" rather quickly?
