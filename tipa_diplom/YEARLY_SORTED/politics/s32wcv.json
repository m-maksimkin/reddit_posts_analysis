Not all of them and things have gotten better but this kind of thing invariably happens to some degree.\n\nWhen Paul and I went to medical school, usually first two years are generally a mountain of facts:  anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, histology, pharmacology, neuroscience, genetics, biostatistics, etc.  Traditionally first year is \"normal\" and the second focused on \"abnormal\".  Anyway, there is just SO much to learn that you can't hope to know it all.  \"Trying to drink from a firehose\" is a phrase you hear a lot.\n\nSo with so much information you start prioritizing what you need to focus on.  And while there's the old joke about how the lowest scoring person in med school is still called \"Doctor\" there are definitely people who are trying their best to be the top of everything from day one.  They're referred to as \"gunners\" (gunning for the top grade/rank) and they're often those who have their mind set on highly competitive specialties and residencies.\n\n Now, I'm happy to say the vast majority of folks I went to medical school with are awesome individuals you'd be happy to have as your doctor.  And even the  vast majority of gunners are actually generous.  We had dudes who'd be like \"Hey I made these PPT and flashcards about the urea cycle, I thought you guys might like them\" and share them.\n\nBut you will absolutely run into dudes like Paul who see their success coming from other's downfall.

Firstly, Rand Paul is a POS, already been known, especially after watching the Fauci-Paul heated exchange that recently happened.\n\nAnyways…\n\nMisinformation is when lies are spread about a certain topic under the condition that the consumers of the incorrect information is believed as the principal truth and are ignorant and defiant of known credible information that debunks or proves against the point.\n\nDisinformation is the intentional and deliberate spread of lies, typically caused by a single or multiple parties, despite having full knowledge and agreement (privately) that the information they conceived is untrue, but instead they push with intention to propagate a particular agenda usually for some form of personal gain.\n\nRand Paul pushes disinformation. He does it because it riles up his base and gets him monetary political contributions and other favors for his own gain, despite the consequences of his rhetoric. His base then becomes misinformed and just repeats the lies to other consumers until it transforms over time. Kind of like COVID having many variants now. Also like a bad game of Telephone, you relay the information until it becomes naturally skewed.\n\nWent on a tangent, but there you go.\n\nDis/misinformation go hand in hand, but for misinformation to manifest, disinformation campaigns must occur first.\n\nEdit: words",
