            "text": "I'm really confused by this article. In the abstract, it focuses on the Patriot Act and the broad surveillance powers it gives to the government. In the specific, it focuses on a terrorism entrapment sting enacted by an FBI informant. There's a very heavy implication that the ridiculous nature of this sting - the way the informant masterminded the plot and basically tricked the defendants into going along with it, even though they would have no capability of carrying it out without the informant's planning and promises of rewards - is an example of the egregious oversteps of power that the Patriot Act enabled.\n\nHowever, as far as I can tell, *these two things are not related*. FBI entrapment schemes aren't directly enabled by the Patriot Act, and the legal precedent used by the judicial system to deny these defendants' appeals - basically saying that \"the FBI is allowed to entice you to commit terrorism, you have to personally back out to avoid prosecution\" - is not an aspect of the Patriot Act either. Although the article notes that this precedent was developed \"post 9/11\", it doesn't actually show any direct relationship. Fundamentally, repealing the Patriot Act would not have any effect on these abuses.\n\nSo what is the deal here? This makes me feel like this article is either poorly/imprecisely written in a way that fails to highlight the actual connections between these visible abuses and how the Patriot Act enabled them; or, it's intentionally trying to obfuscate a lack of ability to tie the Patriot Act to any outrageous conduct by the government in the decades since it was put into law, by introducing unrelated outrages and implying that they're directly connected.",
