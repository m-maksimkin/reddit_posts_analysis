Candidates that promise to be the least like an actual Democrat. Picking presidential running mates solely by electoral map or demographic. They are playing some 1800’s strategies and dilute their party. \n\nNow you have a Republican party that stands for nothing and a Democratic party that stands for everything, including what Republicans used to stand for. \n\nIt’s a breath of fresh air to hear a candidate actually speak their ideals and not dumb things down and only talk in sound bites. \n\nRight now all of the names in politics on the right are trying to appease a mob and the names on the left are silently pointing in disapproval while nothing is done and there isn’t even a chance at any dialogue. Democrats have a <1% chance in states where the mob is popular, but they always find some decorated person to smile for the camera and lose.\n\nI don’t expect Mr. Chambers to unseat Kennedy, but he will outperform every single democrat nationwide.",

If cali wants to make it legal for people to sell, use drugs, Rob places of business and use the bathroom on their sidewalks and the ppl from that state vote for it then so be it....Same for him,  If the state votes this man in and are better for it, Who is anyone to say different when they don't live in that mans state.
