Think about this. And as you think about it, consider that this pertains to more than this non-starter of COVID response activism. It reflects on all sorts of other progressive causes. What if the activism on those other causes actually has this same structure, this same form, of lacking a real \"mortal edge\", a real ability to undertake serious activism? \n\nLet me give just one example of what I'm talking about: what Greta is talking about when she calls out even the supposed progressive legislators and others on climate change.

Conventional wisdom is that natural selection will remove highly lethal pathogens if host death greatly reduces transmission. Vaccines that keep hosts alive but still allow transmission could thus allow very virulent strains to circulate in a population. Here we show experimentally that immunization of chickens against Marek's disease virus enhances the fitness of more virulent strains, making it possible for hyperpathogenic strains to transmit. Immunity elicited by direct vaccination or by maternal vaccination prolongs host survival but does not prevent infection, viral replication or transmission, thus extending the infectious periods of strains otherwise too lethal to persist. Our data show that anti-disease vaccines that do not prevent transmission can create conditions that promote the emergence of pathogen strains that cause more severe disease in unvaccinated hosts.\n\nOriginal languageEnglish (US) JournalPLoS biology Volume13 Issue number7 StatePublished - 2015\n\nhttps://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/imperfect-vaccination-can-enhance-the-transmission-of-highly-viru-2",

What would possibly be unscientific about that. \n\nBy the way, where did the virus originate? Where did the Brazilian variant, the UK variant, and the delta variant originate? I thought we stopped naming the variants after the location of origin because we don’t want to hurt people’s feelings, but I guess that only applies to tyrannical communist dictatorships like China. \n\nDeSantis is very pro vaccine, so I’m not sure why he’s pictured here. He’s against lockdowns and mandatory masks and vaccine passports. Data from around the world shows that these policies are not effective. The data is clear that the vaccine is the best option. Every adult in America can get the vaccine for free whenever they want. Death rates and hospitalizations are way down, even as case levels rise. From a public policy standpoint, the pandemic is as good as over. \n\nI can’t wait until y’all find out that vaccine passports will basically ban 65% of POC from participating in public life, and have to start arguing that they are a form of systemic racism. Only about 30-40% of black people are vaccinated.
