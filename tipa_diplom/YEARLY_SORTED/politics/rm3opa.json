I hate Mitch McConnell, but that entire crisis could have been avoided if we had had the majority. Obama completely failed to pass an effective universal healthcare option, and having been on the ACA It is horrifically stressful to you, and costly if you want any kind of coverage. And this occurred while Obama had a super majority...\n- Or the Clintons both trying to make themselves relevant again, despite Bill being deeply tied to Epstein, and Hillary remaining to be one of the least likable figures in politics who managed to lose to a loathsome orange con artist; people seem to forget her messaging was terrible, and she once suggested she should stay in the race against Obama because he might get shot (Keith Olberman exploded for 10 minutes, saying she should never run for office again which people have also forgotten)\n- The Democrats also seem to have forgotten they were the ones who first questioned the trustfulness behind electronic voting systems when Trump first won, and blamed it on hacking by the Russians. Nobody seems to realize, Trump basically flip that table one for one. If neither party trust nothing electronic voting systems can't be hacked, then why the fuck are we using them, and neither party making a real effort to get rid of them??\n\nThe Democrats need desperate change in leadership. I don't know who that person is, but at this point they're going to have to be a complete outsider... Because I don't think there's a single Democrat in office right now that could win the majority of the American public against Trump. \n\nMaybe Warren, but her campaign last time was such a disaster, and kept waffling on every major issue important to her immediate base. All she literally had to do, was stay on message with regards to health care, and perhaps making agreement with barony for whoever does best to become VP. Instead she took out her closest ally...\n\nThe Democrats don't seem to understand they aren't a cult like the right, they can't just run on and say whatever they like without repercussion. Although that line for the right, might be vaccinations 🙄 since Trump has now been booed multiple times for even remotely suggesting people should get it. Although at this point, I suspect Trump will win again in 2024 based on the current culture of the Democratic Party. \n\nBut hey, everything going wrong right now can still be corrected.
