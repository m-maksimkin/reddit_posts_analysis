If redditors actually watched or read the news articles they're commenting on they'd notice the GOP is trying to stop the teaching of the 1619 project. The writer, Nikole Hannah-Jones, is a journalist, not a historian. From what I can tell from reading the actual issue of the project, the thesis is that America's real founding date is the first time African slaves were shipped to the American colonies, and it also said that the American Revolution was due to Americans not wanting to give up the institution of slavery. \n\nThere are so many things wrong with this argument. There are dozens of well established historians who refute these claims. To say that the founding year of America should be 1619 is an objectively false narrative. There was no United States at that time - the first colony wasn't even established until 1607! The American Colonies were under British rule for another 120-something years, and Britain didn't abolish slavery until 1807, so there would be no logical reason for the colonists to separate from Britain to keep the institution of slavery a whole forty years earlier if Britain was still one of the main perpetrators of said institution. \n\nThe project after the main paragraphs talk a lot about atrocities against African Americans throughout American History. Yes - these are absolutely conversations we should be having, but by putting those in while also trying to establish a false narrative about the beginnings of our country is not the way to do it.",

I would imagine that many people have no idea what critical race theory is, so I will give a very brief summary of what it amounts to. Critical race theory teaches that white people are evil, you should apologize to anyone that is not white for existing if you are white, and no matter your circumstances, any shortcomings or problems you face in life are a result of white people being responsible for them. \n\nThere is a reason why critical race theory is mutually disliked on both the left and right.

My wife is a card carrying member of the Choctaw Indian Tribe, a beautiful redhead, but her ancestors on her Grandfathers side were american Indians. We are all mixed! My family is conservative, and we are not evil. I believe our schools should teach history accurately, I don't agree with whitewashing it. But we shouldn't politicize it and hold contemporary whites somehow responsible for what happend hundreds of years ago. The media has fueled this fire and what was non-existent 24 months ago is now a short fuse ready to ignite; any time you get someone cutting in line or making a mistake in traffic, self-righteous violence ensues against the whites. We are accosted by BLM activists with bullhorns while eating with our families in restauraunts taunted, being called racists, over and over...Meanwhile career criminals being shot by cops are being canonized by the press further fueling the fire-where does it end? This is madness, I do think non-lethal police technology should be developed further, but the vast majority of the shootings were not racially motivated, regardless of what the vermin media reported (the media cannot be trusted, by anyone, they are not on anyone's side other than the dollar). Black on black crime is the biggest problem in this country, nobody wants to talk about that, it doesnt make Al Sharpton any money. I am afraid for my son who is about to leave for college. None of us have ever lashed out at anyone because of their race, but it seems it has become politically correct for whites to be violated because..slavery? Fuck that.",

Things like these fuel anti-white sentiments and can make white children feel alienated, which can also fuel anti-black racism.

If you aren't aware, the 1619 project is journalism written by journalists, not historians.  It's an editorial that has been highly criticized by not just the GOP, but also historians, scholars, and archeologists.  Here are some of their reactions to the writing:\n\nSeveral historians expressed \"strong reservations\" about the project and requested factual corrections, accusing the authors of a \"displacement of historical understanding by ideology\".\n\nThey disputed the project's claim that  \"one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery\". One historian even said, \"I don't know of any colonist who said that they wanted independence in order to preserve their slaves ... No colonist expressed alarm that the mother country was out to abolish slavery in 1776.\"\n\nAnother responded, \"No effort to educate the public in order to advance social justice can afford to dispense with a respect for basic facts\"\n\nA group of scholars stated, \"The 1619 Project offers a historically-limited view of slavery.\" While agreeing to the importance of examining American slavery, they objected to what they described as the portrayal of slavery as a uniquely American phenomenon, to construing slavery as a capitalist venture, and to presenting out-of-context quotes of a conversation between Abraham Lincoln and \"five esteemed free black men\".\n\nHistorians dispute the projects claims that American slavery began in 1619 when the US colonies brought over black slaves.  The Spaniards had slaves in America nearly 100 years earlier. One historian went so far as to say people have \"spent their careers trying to correct the erroneous belief\" put forth by the 1619 project.\n\nOne historian who even consulted on the project warned that the idea that the American Revolution was fought to protect slavery was inaccurate.\n\nAll this is readily available information - you can find it easily summarized in the project's Wikipedia article.\n\nTLDR: So in summary, the GOP is not trying to ban teaching the history of slavery.  They want to ban the inaccurate history of slavery that tries to push a biased social narrative.  We should all want history based on facts not journalists' ideology. That's not history at all.  It's opinion.",

Teaching the next generation about the slave trade, plantations, the controversy at the constitutional convention, the subsequent struggle between slave and nonslave states, the Civil War. The occupation, Jim Crow, and segregation is fine. I certainly leaned all about it before a certain NYT essay won a Pulitzer for daring to challenge our precious founders and ideals.\nThe problem is when the 1619 Project rewrites history, ignoring the fact that many of the founders were agaist slavery, and that the US was the first nation to consider banning it. Proof of this is in the 3/5, and also a moratorium on banning slavery until the 19th century. This conflict eventually lead to one of our bloodiest, most destructive wars, fought against our own.\nThe bigger issue is that the 1619 Project essentially blames all our current racial disparities, in which whites have significantly more income and wealth than blacks, on slavery and it's legacy. But this ignores contemporary issues like the rise of suburbs, the war on drugs, and various other policies made in the last 50 or so years that had a direct impact on those alive today or their parents. Slavery has existed for all of recorded history, in all parts of the world. Making it black VS white does not explain how Asians outperform both on standardized tests and academics. It neglects the ethnic cleansing of the native tribes, or the discrimination against countless other groups, be it Irish, Italians, Jews, Latinos, Chinese, Japanese, Germans.\nThe 1619 Project pretends as if the mere existence of slavery, which became racialized when Britain cut off the slave trade from Africa, inherently leads to blacks being the under class, perpetually struggling, poor and unable to succeed. This mindset will ensure that nothing is done, because it ignores the very real problems of today, problems that affect all races, to perpetuate racial hatred that only divides us. The way forward is together. A tiny minority of 15% of the population does itself no favors by enslaving itself to perpetual victimhood. The solution is not reparations, not discrimination against whites or Asians, but a true examination of the restriction of opportunities, the cycle of poverty, and providing the tools and ability of our people to live fuller lives. This is not a uniquely American challenge, it's an economic and societal one that all nations face.",

They’re still teaching about the history of slavery and racism in the state, they’re just prohibiting things like getting course credit for political activism (which candidly sounds ridiculous anyway) and passing on a new initiative that’s reframing history to put race issues and black contributions at the CENTER of the narrative, vs. simply included alongside other factors. \n\nYou can argue that the 1619 initiative is a good cause and that we should put black issues front and center throughout teaching history, but that’s clearly a subjective opinion, and there’s a wide chasm between that and “banning teaching about slavery.”",

The way southern states teach slavery/Jim Crow is ATROCIOUS and is setting black kids up for a lot of confusion and self-esteem issues.  I'd rather they just not talk about it at all because the way they teach it is damaging black kids' sense of self.  I had to watch a 5 year old black boy go from confident and carefree earlier this year, to now worried that everyone hates him because of his skin color and concerned that he's inferior some how.  We're doing major damage as it is.\n\nAnd to all the predictable downvoters who think they know better because they live in \"polite\" society but have never had to witness the effects in their own home - No other group of children in this country is constantly bombarded with messages about their historical trauma and perceived inferiority throughout history. We don't teach Jewish kids about Ann Frank and the death chambers in Kindergarten.  Why the heck do black kids need to be fed these messages so early?",

We then totally didn't try to kill all those guys. Then some other white guys (We think they were Dutch or something) showed up and said they had a bunch of folks from Africa on their ship who totally hated living in Africa and we could adopt them for a nominal fee just to cover the transportation costs.\n\n\nWe, being a completely pro-immigration society that has never *ever* tried to commit genocide on every single ethnic minority that ever showed up here, thought that was a great idea. So we took those Africans and gave them \"freedom housing\" and let them work in our \"freedom fields\" in \"freedom chains\" until a few of them said they didn't like it, and then we stopped doing that. Oh and some dickhole burned down Atlanta this one time FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER!\n\n\nNothing much of interest happened after that until Nixon declared the war on drugs and won the war in Vietnam. A bit later, Regan won the war on drugs and opened the way for our lord and savior DONALD TRUMP, who couldn't tell you whether this history lesson I just posted is made up or not.\n\n\nHow'd I do?",

Almost ten minutes and no text summary, so we have to listen to the whole thing.  \n\nThis appears to be about state legislatures taking on the teaching of the 1619 Project in schools. So the headline, of course, is completely inaccurate, and at least 99.9% of commenters are responding to the headline rather than the actual issue at hand.\n\nSo to recap:  \nNHJ: Writes 1619 Project.  \nConservatives: Point out factual problems with the 1619 Project, and also disagree with the fundamental premise/assumptions.  \nPulitzer Foundation: Offers 1619 Project module for schools to use in teaching the 1619 Project.  \nState Legislatures: Ban teaching of the 1619 Project.  \nMSNBC: OMG the GOP is banning the teaching of slavery!!!  \nreddit: Those GOP bastards are all white supremacists.  \n\nIf this were a discussion about whether the 1619 Project is factually accurate, and/or if it had value to being taught in schools, that would be a legitimate discussion. Instead, this is a discussion about something that is categorically false.  \n\nImagine the flip side: a headline \"reddit wants American children to be taught to hate America\". What's wrong with that? Well, first, there is no such thing as \"reddit wants\" or \"reddit thinks\". Something that has 25% support, 20% against, and 55% don't care will show up on reddit as overwhelming support because of the way the voting works. It doesn't mean that redditors as a whole agree, or even that there is such a thing as \"redditors as a whole\". Second, it presume the 1619 Project (in this example) teaches those who read/study it to hate America. Third, it presumes that wanting it to be *allowed* to be taught in schools is equivalent to wanting schoolchildren to be taught to hate America. And then you read the article or whatever, and find out that what it means is that there was a discussion where a majority of people did not agree with state legislatures outright banning the teaching of the 1619 Project. It's about three giant leaps too far.  \n\nThis is a false headline and a false premise.",

It’d be a shame if a bunch of random assholes on the internet shared slavery related facts to counter it...\n\nFun fact: Georgia started out as a slavery-free colony. 20 years into its existence however its board of trustees managed to wrestle control from James Oglethorpe and codify slavery into their charter.\n\nOglethorpe was an interesting dude. From what little research I’ve done on him he at least once bought a slave specifically to free them, he was known for keeping his word when dealing with the indigenous people and taking them seriously as human beings. His idea for Georgia (which he’d had when originally seeking the colony’s royal charter) was to take the dregs from London and giving them a chance to start over with less focus on punitive servitude (as was the case in other colonies) and more on the belief that people could get their shit together if they had the chance.\n\nUnfortunately most of the people who came to America *with money* wanted a whole hell of a lot more of it than a colony without slaves could provide so as soon as it was possible Oglethorpe was ousted and Georgia was put on course to become the state with the highest population of slaves in the nation. Or the highest ratio of slaves to free men, Im a little rusty on my Georgia history overall and I could’ve gotten that mixed up for sure.\n\nWe’re told that slavery was a thing the British insisted on and that institution itself was simply too deeply ingrained and complex to remove. Meanwhile Georgia was founded in 1733, slavery was installed as law there in the 1750s. In Georgia at least, these mfs wanted slavery so bad they could taste it. That’s why Georgia started keeping slaves. They didn’t inherit it, they *installed* it. Georgia in particular is unique in this way (even most NE states largely didn’t outlaw slavery until the 1780s) but it also kills the myth that slavery was some universal given. It was not. Not even in the south. What we think of as chattel slavery had opposition since its conception but it had enough *mainstream* opposition that the crown let a mf found a slave-free colony 100 years before they would outlaw it themselves. It was not a pre-requisite for granting a charter.",

I am fully aware of what kind of nation this is (hint hint this is a nation built on the backs of slaves, over the graves of the native inhabitants, chock full of lies and dependant upon illusions to maintain the delusions!). I have been painfully aware that I live in a place that will always consider me to be a part of an inferior subgroup, since I was 9yo and started getting harassed by the local cops and security guards at Sam Goody (despite the fact that I didn't even realize that stealing was a thing yet! I was 9 I didn't even own a record player in the 1970's nor did I have any reason or desire to steal anything at that age! this type of shit still happens to me and since I have grown up, I also get falsely accused of a random assortment of other crimes due to racially motivated errors in judgement let's just call them...). I have lived through this pattern of harassment for years now, as it comes in waves, depending on how upset white people are at us at any given time. Collective punishment, systematic racism, or just \"playing the race card\" however you look at it says more about you than it does about anything else. Either way, America is falling into the dustbin of history much more rapidly than I ever could have predicted. It is as if the Civil War never took place! Since it was a lost cause from it's cursed founding (a founding based on genocide, slavery and white supremacy, the only 3 things that made America's founding unique), it was always just a matter of time before the raw seething hatred that brought us the revolutionary war stirred again as we dove head first into the civil war, which (even after a decisive victory and no retaliation from the north visited upon the south) evolved into a bitter, persistent north/south rift, racism of the jim crow era, and it also spawned the destructive (for us blacks) movement known as massive resistance, from here we see the growing roots of the modern neo nazi movement and the various offshoots. Eventually many of these disparate groups merged with other groups like the evangelical christians or the religious right, from which we eventually got groups like the tea party which eventually got distilled down to the current modern white supremacist movements and the plethora of white supremacist hate groups we see today (including the numerous hate groups affiliated and infatuated with the GOP!). The GOP is the in cahoots with the police, has it's tentacles in the criminal justice system (from the Supreme Court all the way down), has infiltrated the military, pentagon and other agencies that were created to ostensibly be apolitical. The cultural rot that is destroying America at the highest rate was born and incubated inside the GOP. Since the majority of Americans are white and since the majority of white people voted for DJT twice in a row, it would appear that America will not be open to change until demographics have shifted to a point where whites are in the minority. Even then, the chances of some new form of Apartheid, or worse, forming in the absence of white hegemony, seems practically inevitable. I don't even want to contemplate the potential \"something worse\" than Apartheid timeline. I still distinctly remember the days of Reagan and Mandela. As a youngster I couldn't for the life of me understand Reagan's logic in shutting out the ANC and deciding to use the CIA to help arrest Mandela. I also watched Reagan's response to the newly discovered AIDS crisis and then it all made sense. These are very bad people we are dealing with here.",

There's actual methodology to it that (real) historians use to come to a consensus on what actually happened. There is a *degree* of subjectivity to it, as human psychology plays such a large role in it, the subject is complex, and so many things are open-ended, but that does not mean that pseudohistory based in \"alternative facts\" is in any way valid.\n\nAny good history curriculum I've ever taken starts with a breakdown of historiography, different schools of thought, how to detect narratives and biases, cross referencing sources, critical thinking skills, etc. so that students are learning a *skill*, not just a story. The study of history is not meant to be just memorizing whatever story we agree to teach.\n\nAnd in this case the story they want to teach isn't history at all, it's mythology and loaded opinions. These guys freak out over us not learning that \"America is the freest and richest country in the world\" and shit like that when that's *literally just an opinion statement that does not belong in a history class*. Watched some dude on Fox freak out over \"critical race theory\", citing the \"fact\" that America has never conquered or colonized and like, bruh shut up. Edit: gonna add that when I was in school we *were* taught this nonsense.\n\nI'm convinced American exceptionalism causes brain rot. They turn it into some weird personal thing when it's not. Of course the reason is they attach themselves to this weird quasi-religious nationalism where they can feel superior for existing and continue benefiting from racist power structures while denying they exist, and the only way for it to make any sense is to destroy logic. Hence the \"paranoid style of politics\", blatant erasure of history, alt-right conspiracies that make zero sense, etc.",

Do you know that on their march to Florida (the trail of tears) they took 2,000 of their slaves with them?  Do you know that there were several Black slave owners in America?  There were several free Blacks that bought White indentured servant women and took them for their wives and their decedents being lighter skin, moved to Kentucky and passed themselves off as Cherokee Indians?  Many of us (me included) supposedly had Indian blood in our family tree, but when DNA tested, no American Indian, However Black DNA.  If you want to teach American History, teach the facts not the Bullshit the ignorant Left is trying to shove down our throats.  Teach about how the Jews have been persecuted for over 2,000 years, and still are around the world as well as in America today.  Teach how in many Arab nations slave ownership is still fairly common.  The ignorant use racism when they run out of logical arguments.   They perpetuate racism by dividing us into subcultures (African American, Asian American, Mexican American, etc....)  Bottom line we are a Nation of Mutts, and WE ARE ALL Americans!  There are good and bad in every race, none are better or worse then the others, it is an individuals choice.  I am VERY proud to be an American, I have some Black DNA, My Mother was an Australian Prostitute, my Dad an American Sailor I never met.  I had a not so good Childhood after surviving a 7 month failed abortion attempt.  I succeeded through hard work despite my horrible abusive childhood, I never did drugs, I could not afford to go to College.

The Teacher even jokingly said, that he had some applications if anyone was interested and we all scoffed.\n\n  \nI don't think it should be covered up. It needs to be taught so we can learn from the past.
