So now just a week and a half away from 9/11 he directs Justice to start the declassification process “to deliver on a campaign promise.” Bullshit! He just wants the ability to show up at the memorials without angering people by doing this this half hearted EO. He could declassify the report immediately, but instead we’re setting up a commission? \n\nJust like we were going to set up a commission about the structure of the Supreme Court after ACB was seated? What happened to that now that we’re in the throes of the Texas abortion crisis?\n\nAnd what about fulfilling other campaign promises like reforming the way people pay for secondary education and are left with tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of debt? What about the $10,000 in forgiveness for all and up to $50,000 of forgiveness based on time spent in public service careers?

So Muslims decided to attack the symbol of American greed, the WTC in the Wall Street district. \n\nThe culpability is on Bush Jr. This wasn't the first time teh WTC was attacked, and CLinton knew and had evidence that it would be attacked again. WHen he tried to pass this on to Bush and Rice, in fact tried several times, even Officials flying out to Bush's ranch to pleade with him Bush's response was to ignore them. That is why Bush had that \"oh, shit\" look on his face when he got word. \n\n  \nThe truth of 9/11 is that it was entirely preventable, if only Bush, (a Repub, of course) had acted on the warnings, and checked boarding passengers for weapons.

The State Department was \"in charge\" of exit which involved many unmarked USA government aircraft coming from all over the country but particularly California. The FBI was present at most of the embarking's and debarking's. They requested and were denied interviews of the Saudi's leaving the country. They were not even allowed to get the names of the Saudi's that were on the aircraft. When FBI agents pushed the issue at one location, a State Department Marshal pulled his gun and threatened the FBI present with the words, We are in charge here, get the f\\*\\*\\*\\* out of here (sic).\r  \n\r  \nOne can only imagine what the motivation was for the Bush administration to get all Saudi's out of the country.
