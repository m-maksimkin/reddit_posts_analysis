The most likely idea is that the smugglers know that if they get caught they lose all their money, so they actually spend it rather than hoarding it.\n\nSo maybe the best way to get trickle-down to work is to tell millionaires and billionaires that after a year all their unspent money money will be taxed at 95%. Simply put, you have a year to enjoy what you made last year.\n\nThis would also agree with sensible economic theories that say the best way to stimulate the economy is to give money to those who are not well off, because they use the money immediately. Basically, for trickle down to have a chance to work, you need to force wealthy people to stop hoarding and start spending most if not nearly all of their money.",

            "text": "There isn't any economist ever who talked about trickle-down economics. It was used first by a comedian attacking a politician and then by an opposing campaign manager. This fantasy construct has become synonymous with supply-side economics which have no trickle-down theory. The Laffer curve also has nothing to do with wealth trickling down, but with tax revenue. Then there are just so many misconceptions in this thread alone about what it ought to do, when it's about something else entirely. \n\nEspecially when people who surely didn't read the study throw it around here act as if that's the definitive proof. It measures a made-up issue like inequality (as If LeBron earning millions more than you do somehow makes you worse off and if he didn't get that much money, then it'd be in your bank account? Obviously not.) against a 'not good enough' estimate of growth and unemployment without taking into account wage developments, standard of living improvements or at least living cost changes. \n\nTax increase on the rich just leads to them giving money to the government and the government spending it on shit that rarely covers the additional administrative cost it comes with. If you want corporations to actually improve, then write appropriate legislation - worker rights, minimum wage etc. Taxes just takes money from one body, gives it to another, less efficient body that cannot create self-sustained jobs as government jobs mostly do not generate revenue (especially ones that don't come at the further expense of the tax payer).",

This wealth capture is a huge loss to the economy and the country.\n\nWe should retroactively re-asses taxes on the ultra-rich.  The US IRS should not shy away from going after the off-shore untaxed money retroactively.\n\nThe other funny thing about American oligarchs is that some of them will flee the US if we increase taxing...  Which is just fine.\n\nThey were parasites to begin with.  We do not need this type of business owner.  The type who does not re-invest money earned using the awesome American capitalist economy back into the US economy and our country.  More tax money means more infrastructure projects, a better social safety net, better healthcare, better schools, a better standard of living.  It means making sure that all Americans benefit from the economic powerhouse that we drive with our labor.  (the US economy)  \n\nThe oligarch class has used the awesome American capitalist economic engine to generate their wealth which they promptly siphoned to offshore tax havens.  \n\nTheir only scope was to \"wealth capture\" as much money as possible while they were able to get away with it during Republican administrations.\n\nI love Capitalism.  It's the best economic engine we have so far.  But it only works if the capital generated from surplus labor value is reinvested back into the economy.\n\nWhat the American oligarchs have done (wealth capture) is not patriotic or capitalist. \n\nDemocrats need to call out Republicans on this.  We need to call out the Republicans' tax cuts and their policies which have allowed the ultra-rich oligarchs to legally avoid paying taxes.  \n\nThe Republicans are the party of the oligarchs.  \n\nThey need to answer as to why they let the oligarchs conduct off-shore wealth transfer and why they've shifted the tax burden onto regular Americans.  \n\nThey (Republicans) also need to have no way to dodge this question.  \n\nPut simply, we need to call them out for supporting the moneyed few over supporting the many and their country's economic well being.  \n\nWe need Democrats who will step forward and explain that wealth-capture is harmful to the economy and the country.  \n\nIt decimates the tax base and leaves diminishing capital for infrastructure projects, for the social safety net, for healthcare, for schools and for improving the standard of living of every US citizen.\n\nThis (wealth capture) is why the US is an economic powerhouse while at the same time has a third-world standing in terms of the social safety net, healthcare, education and standard of living.\n\nRepublicans, wealth capture to offshore accounts and legal tax avoidance is not patriotic!  It harms America!  It is un-American!",

You can go to the poorest ghetto in the nation and you’ll see nice cars, smart phones in every pocket, clothes on everyone’s back,(usually nice) shoes on everybody’s feet, and morbidly obese people waddling around. \n\nTrickle down economics undeniably works. Leftists are just upset because the poor in this country aren’t just given money simply because they exist.  They’re mad because they think the federal government is entitled to their cut of everything, just like some kind of legal bureaucratic mafia.  How can left ever gain power if they don't paint the bleakest picture possible when it comes to free market capitalism?   \n\nJust ask yourself a question- are socialist nations classless societies?  Are you under the impression that socialism cures poverty or creates ambition?  Do you really want a cradle to the grave government which you become beholden to?  A second set of parents who will\ndecide how to spend the money you earned as they see fit?  \n\nWe are by far the most prosperous nation this planet has ever seen. Millions of people risk life and limb to get to our nation for the economic opportunity which exists here. This is all due to free market, trickle down economics. The only thing the left knows how to spread evenly is misery.",
