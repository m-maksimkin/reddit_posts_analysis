Comes as little surprise that she's long, and curiously, taken the Offocial Kremlin-line regarding Crimea, Syria and Assad and the chemical-weapons used there, along with buying into the \"Respect Russian Security concerns\" today. \n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/russia-s-propaganda-machine-discovers-2020-democratic-candidate-tulsi-gabbard-n964261\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/tulsi-gabbard-being-used-russians-former-us-double-agent-evidence-clear-opinion-1466750\n\nMeanwhile here on Reddit, authentic Sanders subreddits became overrun by \"Russiagate / Anti-Russophobia\" peddlers toeing an incredibly Pro-Russian / Anti-American line — engaging in the sort of Gaslighting Whataboutism the Russian Troll Farms (e.g., IRA) and FSB have as textbook tactics. Other subs like Way of the Bern or Kossacks for Sanders were even more blatant launching-points for right-wing groups and Russian-apologists masquerading as Sanders supporters. Unfortunately some legitimate supporters drank the vodka, here, as well.\n\nI further want to bring attention to the likes of Glenn Greenwald's (Former UK Guardian journalist following Snowden, Intercept founder) descent into this narrative; and it strikes me as odd on hindsight how both Greenwald and Snowden fled to Moscow, and Greenwald increasingly took up this pro-Russian / Anti-American narrative in kind. It was a stark contrast to his previous years and he became more...Unhinged interviews he'd give. https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712173436/police-in-london-arrest-julian-assange-after-ecuadorean-embassy-evicts-him\n\nJust a few days-ago Greenwald was on Fox News, pushing a both-sides narrative seemingly in an attempt to muddy the waters. https://video.foxnews.com/v/6299015942001\n\nTo me, either they were Russian assets all along, or they bit off more than they could chew and became severely blackmailed while remaining in Russia. If you read Luke Harding's work in Russia and his reporting on the Polonium Poisoning, this shouldn't come as a surprise. Greenwald essentially went from being a respectable Journalist to an attorney to Snowden and an outright activist/apologist for Russia in many instances.\n\nTo me it seems pretty clear there is a concerted effort from right-wing extremist groups and pro-Russian groups to drive a wedge within the progressive coalition with this issue, chiefly to fragment the Democrats while simultaneously promoting Trump and Republicans. (And that's coming from someone who was ardently opposed to Neoconservative invasion of Iraq in 2003).\n\n(Friendly reminder that Putin pushed for Trump's reelection; perhaps in part because Trump both publicly and privately embraced the idea of not just de-funding NATO but withdrawing from it, entirely. Also that the NRA was a laundering-point for Russian money, and that Russian money was flowing into Republican campaigns).\n\n(apologies for not formatting links; I understand many are concerned about malware URLs)\n\nEdit: correction on date for intelligence report.

In general, I would think any infectious disease that you are researching could be dangerous and used as a bio weapon. Intentionally or not. They could blow up the building and release something, I don’t know. Maybe that’s not how it works. But are we all upset because of who is saying it? Or more because it plays into the hands of the propaganda of Putin? \n\n\nBecause in her tweet reply which I took a glance at, she doesn’t mention a government website that confirms the US funds left.

            "text": "Let's look at Gabbard's original tweet and see if it bears truth:\n\n\"There are 25+ US-funded biolabs in Ukraine which if breached would release & spread deadly pathogens to US/world. We must take action now to prevent disaster. US/Russia/Ukraine/NATO/UN/EU must implement a ceasefire now around these labs until they’re secured & pathogens destroyed\"\nhttps://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1502960938147729413\n\nFirst she claims there are US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. After facing backlash she provided evidence showing that the DoD has programs in place which give money to the Ukrainian government to help run these labs. Nowhere in the tweet does she mention the creation of a bioweapon. The program run by the DoD was started in 2005 to help keep the Ukrainians biolabs safe (many of these facilities were created during the Soviet era). You can read the state department's original publication about the program here: \nhttps://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/05-829-Ukraine-Weapons.pdf\n\nNext she calls for a ceasefire. Much of the backlash from this is coming from the fact that the Russian's are using the existence of these facilities to promote their war. This conspiracy is being used both in Russia and abroad, including the United States. However, Gabbard is not calling for war, but a ceasefire.\n\nThere is an excellent Snopes article which debunks the conspiracy and talks about the program run by the DoD to support the Ministry of Health of Ukraine in preventing the proliferation of pathogens studied in Ukraines various bio facilities. The one's named in the State Department publication are Scientific Research Institute of Epidemiology and Hygiene (Lviv), the Ulaainian Scientific Research Anti-Plague Institute (Odessa), and the Central Sanitary Epidemiological Station (Kyiv). Here is the snopes article:\nhttps://www.snopes.com/news/2022/02/24/us-biolabs-ukraine-russia/\n\nOverall I'm really dissapointed in the overall reaction to the tweet. I don't feel it's promoting disinformation, although it's certainly clear the Russian's are using the existance of these facilities to do so. Gabbard may very well be issuing these statements to gain the favor of Americans who are falling for these conspiracy theories, though. I wouldn't be surprised if she runs under the Republican ticket in 2024. The conservative establishment seems to be preparing for it.",

Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) during a visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. The senators credited Ukraine's reformist leaders, ushered into power by last fall's Orange Revolution, with breaking bureaucratic resistance to the pact.\n\n> One lab to receive funding is the I.I. Mechnikov Antiplague Scientific and Research Institute, in the Black Sea port city of Odessa. **The institute was part of a Cold War network of \"antiplague\" stations that supplied highly lethal pathogens to Soviet bioweapons factories**.\n\nie: Literal bio-weapons labs\n\n> \"This agreement will allow us to begin addressing the problems faced by the Odessa antiplague institute and places like it,\" said Mark Helmke, a staff member for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which Lugar chairs. Under the pact, the United States will fund security upgrades at key Ukrainian biological institutes and support peaceful research by Ukrainian scientists to fight the spread of natural diseases, Helmke said. The amount of funding has not been determined.\n\n> The senators' visit to Russia and Ukraine was disrupted Sunday when local authorities refused to allow the delegation's military plane to leave Perm, a city in Russia's Ural Mountains. The officials demanded that they be allowed to search the plane, then relented after several hours and allowed the aircraft to proceed to Ukraine, a spokesman for Lugar said. Yesterday, Russia's Foreign Ministry formally apologized for the incident.\n\nOK, so where is Tulsi lying exactly?\n\n> In a video, Gabbard claimed that the \"undeniable facts\" are that 35 to 40 \"U.S. funded bio labs\" in Ukraine that are conducting research into dangerous pathogens. Gabbard went on to express concerns that these \"deadly pathogens\" could be released if the labs in Ukraine are targeted amid the conflict with Russia.\n\n> \"Like COVID, these pathogens know no borders,\" Gabbard said. \"If they are inadvertently or purposely breached or compromised, they will quickly spread all throughout Europe, the United States and the rest of the world, causing untold suffering and death.\"\n\nBarack Obama helped secure the funding deal with these Ukrainian bio-weapons labs.\n\nTulsi is calling out that they do exist, that the US is providing funding to them, and then explains that she is worried about it considering the current war in the Ukraine.\n\nIt was Putin who implied that these labs are somehow tied to Covid, *not* Tulsi. \n\nSo, what is Tulsi doing wrong in this particular scenario?",

After all, it was one of the first countries to develop a COVID vaccine, one which Lancet, on February 1, 2021, pronounced was “ safe and effective” (even though U.S. officials pressured multiple countries, including Brazil, not to accept any Russian vaccine, while U.S. allies such as Australia refused for a full year to recognize the Russian COVID vaccine for purposes of its vaccine mandate). The only reason to be “quite concerned” about these \"biological research facilities” falling into Russian hands is if they contain sophisticated materials that Russian scientists have not yet developed on their own and which could be used for nefarious purposes — i.e., either advanced biological weapons or dual-use “research” that has the potential to be weaponized.\n\n\n*EDITED: To add Glenn Greenwald's substack & excerpt from the article.",

Gabbard says they are, US state department says they are not. I’m very open to how others think, and maybe I’m missing something, but I fail to see how arguing about the source of funding, even if Gabbard is dead wrong, qualifies as treasonous. \nThe US, being a world leader in medical research, undoubtedly does fund different labs around the world, possibly including this one, and I’m sure the state department has many reasons to publicly deny that, even if we do. Take out the portion of her tweet that says US funded and we should all be in agreement. There is more than likely pathogenic labs in Ukraine, and it should be sensible to advocate for their protection during a time of war so that a mistake from either side does not lead to a pathogen escape. India just accidentally sent a missile to Pakistan, it’s not inconceivable that either side could “mistakefully” bomb one of these labs and lead to something like World War Z. I understand how bio labs have become controversial with COVID, but I think it’s stupid. They are very important to medical research, and for understanding how pathogens work but also very dangerous, especially if a rogue country does decide to use them in war (it is very possible). Russia used chemical weapons on civilians before, they certainly could do it again. We should secure these places so its harder for them to do them just shooting a missile into a building and waiting for various pathogens to escape.",

Gabbard went on to express concerns that these \"deadly pathogens\" could be released if the labs in Ukraine are targeted amid the conflict with Russia.\n\n\n**Also from the article.   This tells me why someone [Tulsi] might make such a claim:**\n\nAccording to a fact sheet released by the Defense Department, the U.S. works with Ukraine and other countries to research the threats of dangerous diseases affecting both animals and humans.\n\nThrough BTRP, the U.S. has invested $200 million in Ukraine since 2005 to support 46 Ukrainian laboratories and their research into disease threats. Such work in Ukraine helped the country in its response to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThere is no evidence of U.S.-funded labs in Ukraine developing germ warfare capabilities. Similar conspiracy theories have been pushed by Russia for decades, including claiming HIV/AIDS was developed in a U.S. military lab.\n\n**I'm not an expert** on any of this stuff.  To me it seems like Tulsi said there are US funded biolabs rather than US funded labs developing biological weapons.   What am I missing?  Did she say there was bio weapon labs on Tucker Carlson or something?",

People who grow up in those environments with extreme religious views are so much more prone to conspiratorial thinking so she probably really believes some of that crazy shit, but it's pretty clear she's also been bought/compromised as well. You can follow the money coming from Russian sources since she became a member of Congress. You all would be shocked and rightfully terrified if you realized how cheap politicians will sell their votes on an individual bill or an entire platform. In America, it's common for corporations and lobbyists to literally write the bills Congress actually votes into law. At the same time, the percentage of average Americans who support a bill has ZERO impact on whether it passes or fails a vote. Something like 80% of people support changing our federal marijuana laws, but that just started being a possibility in the past few years and still might be a ways off because religious zealots will fight it (ironically, most wine was \"infused\" with either marijuana or terpentine during Jesus' lifetime so he likely partook). Then you have Trump's tax cuts which never had more than 35% support that easily passed.\n\n\nI think the majority of Americans agree that we shouldn't be constantly getting involved in proxy wars, but this is why people shouldn't be single issue voters and pay attention to any candidate's entire platform... As well as who is giving them money, any candidate that takes corporate money won't get my vote no matter their political affiliation. Yes, that makes it a little difficult to find candidates that can actually win because our elections are like a popularity contest so if you don't have millions to spend on advertising then people won't pay attention long enough to learn your platform. It's common where I grew up to vote for \"the person you'd like to have a beer with\" based off seeing them on TV which is fucking moronic.\n\nPersonally, I think we have to kill the two party system if we are going to have any real chance at campaign finance reform. As long as we allow our politicians LEGALLY bought and sold by corporations, special interest groups, and dark money (thanks SCOTUS) then it's not really accurate to say we live in a democratic republic. More like a kleptocracy/oligopoly. There's really not a big difference between Republicans and Democrats... That was especially true ten years ago, but obviously things have gotten more divisive most of that is rhetoric not action. I will say that Republicans current platform seems to be \"obstruct everything until we are in power, then change the laws so we can keep that power in a majority progressive nation, and all they really do with that power is cut taxes for corporations (lying to people saying they'll see money from it \"trickle down\" which was genius messaging by Reagan, but was always known bullshit) and, ironically for this post, start some wars. Oh yeah, they also really seem to like to implement Judeo-Christian norms into law which is completely unconstitutional. Still, pretending democrats aren't bought and sold as well is naive and I'm not just talking about people like Manchin.",

It would make sense for all of these strains to be under research for treatment since they do tend to affect hospitalized patients more than healthy individuals.  Except for Diphtheria, that is the odd man out of the group, even then though it's not a pathogen that could be easily weaponized, at least to my knowledge.  The more I look into this it does actually just seem like it's part of a global health program and I was very apprehensive at first based upon what Victoria Nuland said about it earlier when questioned by Rubio. I think her answer was just from a lack of awareness on how it could be interpreted and it's unfortunate to see Gabbard jump on this train of Russian propaganda.

Russia has shared documents of the lab apparently showing gross violations of the biological weapons convention of they’re true, so it’s a very serious accusation. Ftr I haven’t seen these documents aside from a screenshoot of the front page of one of them, bc the media/internet blackout on Russia has made things super difficult to cross reference or verify unless you know the exact url. \n\nThe US hasn’t done a great job at not looking guilty. It has changed its story on tbe existence of these labs, and has accused China spreading lies about the labs, despite China having only asked the US for evidence countering Russia’s statement due to the “severity of the accusation”. Simply dismissing it as Russian propaganda works well on a western audience, not as well with foreign heads of state. It also isn’t helping that the US has operated under “US exceptionalism” for decades, where the US has been uniquely exempt from international law. That and the US has dabbled in biological weapons in the past. So Russia’s claim is entirely possible, but given their position right now with regards to the US, either a multilateral investigation is needed, or the US needs to provide documents from said lab that shows inconsistencies with the documents that were released by Russia.\n\nBasically it’s a bad idea to assert the truth of Russia’s claims, but they are severe claims and seem entirely plausible, so to write them off as “fake news” or “kremlin propaganda” without directly confronting the evidence is irresponsible as well",
