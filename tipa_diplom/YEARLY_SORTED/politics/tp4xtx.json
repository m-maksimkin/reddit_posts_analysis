Both republican and democrat-led governments have lied to us so much I'm surprised anyone willingly believes anything any politician says. There are some serious issues with plans to tax \"unrealized gains,\" and I don't buy for a moment that this will only affect households with net worth above $100 million. First, smart rich people don't really \"own\" anything. They use corporate structures and trusts to hold assets, including real estate, investments (stocks, bonds, gold etc), cash and other property. If I understand this, then so do the people always looking for more and more ways to tax everything. But if you put out the headline \"Biden wants to tax the super-rich, then the dem based is energized and poised to get super pissed at republicans who stand against the measure. Two wins in one: rally the base who's been taught to hate the rich (even though 99% of them would love to be rich themselves), and give them yet another reason to see their political adversaries as impediments to the \"progress\" such a measure would provide.    \n\n\nSecond, if the measure passes, or taxing unrealized gains becomes law, then you can kiss any opportunity of becoming truly wealthy goodbye.  Imagine you buy a Bitcoin at $45,000 and on December 31st, it's value is $100,000. You don't sell because you believe its going to keep going up. Then on January 4th, the BTC value is $42,000. Well during that tax year you had an unrealized gain of $55,000 and this new tax would require you to pay 20% on that unrealized gain. Gov will expect you to pay $11,000 on money you never took out. Same with the equity in your home and other assets that fluctuate in value due to market forces. I don't see any mention of being able to write off unrealized losses. Also, would this apply to retirement savings plans? Your Roth IRAs? Maybe it won't now, but we've become far too comfortable giving government more and more power when the liars we want to believe are in office. That new government power won't disappear when your preferred team isn't in control.  \n\n\nI know taxing the rich is a really popular idea, but I hope more will consider the long-term potential impacts of these proposals. Government has not shown itself to be a responsible steward of power or money. As such, perhaps we should all be hoping they get less of both.",

There is no fucking way a billionaire 20% minimum tax gets passed, or it gets passed in a way that doesn’t actually effect their true income.\n\nVote them all out, left and right. Get enough random people out of a phone book to fill congress and the executive branch and we’d have a 100x more efficient and effective government. \n\nThese people are so disconnected with the reality of everyday people they have no idea what really matters. Which is why they talk about voting rights, Jan 6 commissions, banning abortions, critical race theory, etc etc, and not about real issues like combating inflation, homelessness, universal prek, universal healthcare, universal childcare.\n\nWhy is it that blame for inflation lies first with Putin and not our insane monetary and spending policy. We will all end up beggars on the street in a few decades when we lose our status as world reserve currency. \n\nStop falling for the same lies every few years. Wake up to the fact the whole left and right paradigm is fake and a game to keep you distracted from the class politics at hand. The rich oligarchs and corporations run this country. The tech monopolies are working in conjunction with the elite to create compliance. The fight over “disinformation” is just a fight for which side gets to control the narrative machine. Total free speech and in all its glory and horror is the only way for a free democracy to shine. We must legislate against big tech before we lose total control, if we haven’t already. \n\nIt is incredibly dangerous, we are currently being shepherded into WW3 so they can use it to blame for all their failings and to clamp down on your freedoms harder. This is the Iraq war playbook of 2003 on steroids, and all dissenting voices are labeled as pro-Putin without a second thought.\n\nRather than pass laws to apply their authoritarian agenda they apply pressure on corporations to do “more”. While this may be seen as a “good thing” in the short term, the more power and control we allow private corporations to seize will ultimately destroy our democracy. Everything from what are acceptable political views for employees, to your own health / bodily autonomy. \n\nWant to know why the housing market is bananas and has been for most of the pandemic? Supply. Big corporations who can spend infinite QE dollars which they know will be worth little with inflation rising, are dumping it into property. Black rock is buying houses at 30-45% above list price, in cash without inspections. Go look on Zillow right now and look at recently sold, see everything listed at $0? That is a corporation or investment fund buying up land. That is the only thing that will survive inflation. They will make you all serfs in the new American fiefdom of our corporate overlords. So next time you hear someone say “well they’re a private company so if you want free speech go make your own platform” just know you are playing right into the hand they want you to play.\n\nI fear for the future of our country.",

Called the &quot;Billionaire Minimum Income Tax,&quot; it would assess a 20% minimum tax rate on U.S. households worth more than $100 million.\n\n> &quot;This minimum tax would make sure that the wealthiest Americans no longer pay a tax rate lower than teachers and firefighters,&quot; the document said.\n\n> &quot;As a result, this new minimum tax will eliminate the ability for the unrealized income of ultra-high-net-worth households to go untaxed for decades or generations,&quot; the document stated.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/tpb2zp/president_joe_biden_to_propose_new_20_minimum/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~637028 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **tax**^#1 **minimum**^#2 **new**^#3 **household**^#4 **deficit**^#5",

After a certain income bracket, your worth or status as a Billionaire isn’t just “income” it is also assets and “unrealized gains.” \n\nThe document says this will hit unrealized gains but not really. It is just total income and is that AGI or gross or what? Unrealized gains are things like stock positions and property not income. The stock positions will be income when they get exercised but until then they suffer the same problem as assets like property. The value continues to go up without “income” to tax until it is sold. This also doesn’t take into account off shore, foundations, non profits or religious. \n\nThis premise is good though, assuming the Americans/entities who are also billionaires want to stay US.\n\nIncluding unrealized gains in the bench mark for the 100M line makes more sense. Similar the NY Corporate tax. \n\n100M seems arbitrary. But if it has a rational, it could be okay. \n\n20% is interesting. I see more 22%, which is inline with current income brackets…in which case the minimum should be that.\n\nEdit. Since the line is 100M, should you name it something like Net Worth Minimum Tax? Edit 2. Or Total Worth or something other than billionaire since it’s not technically correct and math is hard.",

NYS made 250 million plus from legalizing gambling and the city has more crime, the roads are awful, more mom and pop/small stores closed. Lets stop believing this government cared about us. They never have and never will. Theres a true evil that lurks in this country.  We need to focus on loving each other first. We need to put differences aside. No more Democrat vs Republican. Vax vs Anti. Straight vs Gay. Who cares! This what they all want! \n\nJesus said the most important rules in the book (Bible):\n\n*Love the Lord with all your heart*\n\n*Love thy neighbor*\n\nThere are very evil people in this country and most, if not all, are rich. Biden been handing out crack pipes. Bush opened poppy fields to funnel heroin after Clinton pushed pharma pills. I can go on and on from every politician. Almost every polician does not care about us only money.  If they did we wouldn’t have the Federal Reserve, CIA, Military Industrial Comples (*Very very evil for all of these*)\n\n\nI am a true believer in God and Jesus. I believe the wicked will wither and the good will prosper. Many will be surprised in the end to see who goes to Heaven and who does not. Remember, God tests the heart. Many of you I know struggle but we will win this fight. Stay strong and vigilant. Its gonna get harder. This country is going to be handed to Republicans who will make you all believe how can God be good with their followers. Remember, many will be *surprised* who goes to Heaven and does not.

It just means that every march I get a bill equal to about 20% of my portfolios value increase (NOT the whole portfolio value, just the increase). I can either use my money or cover it by selling some stocks. It means that a 10% return is actually an 8% return. Its a lot over 20-30 years, but so is the tax I pay on my paychecks and both stocks and paychecks are income. Both should be taxed. \n\nJust be happy that this is something that only applies if you are worth over 100 million USD. None of you guys will ever pay this tax.",

Because it’s a tax on those just worth 100 million or more this includes unrealized gains, you know not physical wealthy but stuff that adds to your net worth like stock and businesses. So this kind of tax creates the potential scenario that every tax season the “less rich” people caught up in this tax don’t actually have the money for that kind of tax just lying around and could lead to them selling off stock to be turned into liquid wealth for tax payments which leads to the very real scenario of the stock market crashing every goddam tax season as rich people who haven’t got the proper tax money yet sell of stock so they can pay taxes.

There is no good reason for this, and it allows people who own all kinds of stocks and bonds to evade taxation in the gains while the little guys pay it. Those gains are *never* taxed, which is absolutely not right, it is a massive tax benefit to the super-wealthy.\n\n2) Reform the estate tax so that it significantly taxes the transfer of large inheritances, while reminding people that the estate tax is to prevent familial dynasties. Currently, the exemption is for $12.6 million. That is way too high. Drop it down to $1 million. It would not affect 90% of the population even at $1m. I don't give a fuck about \"family farms\", which largely don't exist at that level the way people thinking of them (as in an elderly couple with a $15m plot of land making $35k by selling eggs). If you inherit a \"family farm\", then take out a fucking loan against it to pay the inheritance taxes, this will prevent inherited farms from having a massive competitive advantage over people who acquired their farms the old-fashioned way, by buying them.\n\n3) Treat loans against assets as step-up events. This means that if you buy stock for $1m, it grows to $100m, and you take a loan of $10m from it, that is a step-up on $9m ($10m - $1m purchase price) and you have to pay the capital gains tax. Don't like that? Then sell your stock to get your money instead of borrowing against your money vault. \n\nThese should be done in conjunction with:\n\n4) Raise the top income tax bracket to very high percentages for very high incomes. I'm talking at least 70%, starting at around $3m per year. Go up to 95% when you get to the $50m range. 70% was the rate when Steve Jobs & Steve Wozniak founded Apple - yet neither of them said \"you know, I have this really great idea, but fuck it, taxes are too high so I'm not going to even try\". Also tax capital gains the same as regular income.\n\nAnd while we're at it:\n\n5) Close up loopholes around \"foundations\". These are vehicles to allow super-wealthy people to retain the power around their wealth while not counting it as income. \n\n6) Close up loopholes around \"tax exempt\" organizations. Do you realize that when a billionaire donates to something like \"Citizens against Immigration\", **it is fucking tax deductible**? As long as the organization is solely producing propaganda, and is not explicitly too political, this is perfectly legal.",

Like the electric cars new energy your production of goods for global distribution and learning to control the corporate greed. Everytime the minimum wage is raised the companies use less employees and make the company automated and self check outs... To pocket the money on higher levels ..like the government says America is over worked and under paid...we can not be successful if the human body life expectancy is just 50 years old after the year 2000 when retirement is at 65. The college graduates suffer cause there's thousands ahead of them waiting all this time for the same jobs... But end up at fast food joints... And not able to pay the loans back... The retirement age needs drastically lowered...other countries went as low as 30 years old...right now in USA we can retire at 50 years old with 25 years of labor... Life on earth has now become a automatic prison sentence...forced labor or imprisonment for taxes... Not paid even if they need help ...nobody does...and yet sending hundreds of millions to other countries seems to be the answer of our employees...named the US government. Peace",
