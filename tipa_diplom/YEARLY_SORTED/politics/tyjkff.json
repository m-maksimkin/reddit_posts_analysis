From some of the sentences she has handed down that I read about, she did her job and followed the law.  The biggest thing I have against her confirmation, is Biden went against laws preventing race discrimination when he said he would hire a black woman.  He by-passed all men of any color and all non-black women, even though they could have been more qualified. Other than that I really don’t have a problem with her being confirmed.

Just because a person of color doesn’t get selected for every job, doesn’t mean racism was involved, sometime the people better fit for the job just so happen to be white. Given her track record with giving PEDOPHILES BELOW THE RECOMMENDED SENTENCES in court cases in the back she was involved in, this isn’t the kind of person I’d want in a lifetime position on the Supreme Court. Not saying she doesn’t have the capacity to be a good Supreme Court justice, she very well could turn out to be a phenomenal addition to the roster, but her track record was clearly not considered at all when she got the nomination, only her skin color and gender (which she couldn’t even define) which is both racist and sexist and unfair to everybody else in the running for this position\n\nEdit: Biden is quoted saying he will nominate the first female person of color to the Supreme Court, that’s the only argument I need he picked on skin and gender that’s the only argument that matters",

Trans issues are such a niche issue to society at large (not for the people themselves though of course) and yet the entire GOP's platform basically revolves around it, because it is the one cultural bigotry that is somewhat still acceptable.

So basically, in the future, when any black woman, or it's safe to say, any black person or woman for that matter, is appointed to some prestigious or coveted position by democrats, it's simply a matter of identity politics, it's only because of their race, sex and/or gender. Ironically meaning that conservatives for the foreseeable future can reject all liberal candidates or nominees based on their race and gender (don't forget religion either), rationalizing it with some petty, presumptuous and shallow argument along the lines of *\"no no no, it's democrats here who are solely voting, nominating and appointing based on race, us conservatives, we're above that!\"*\n\nWhile I think it's also pretty safe to assume that Martin Luther King Jr would not be radically opposed to this decision. And dont forget how one minute MLK is a \"commie\" and the next he's being called upon as the basis for an argument. I mean holy fucking shit, c'mon now. If anything, he certainly *would* look at the fact that less than 5% of lawyers are black and just 70 black women have served as a federal judge, and he wouldn't take these statistics, turn them around and lambaste the appointment, I'm almost certain he'd count it as a step forward while understanding and noting, despite flimsy right wing narratives, that Jackson is more than qualified for the position. Anything else would be out of character, stop grasping at straws.\n\n*That's the fucking point! That in spite of her qualifications, particularly compared to former supreme court picks, conservatives are still hell bent on blaming it on race.
