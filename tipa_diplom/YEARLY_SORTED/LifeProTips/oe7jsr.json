It’s funny that this post came up because I’d like to chime in on my experience.  \n\nI started off with a low profile bed that had a five inch mattress made of foam, a bed and frame I found on Amazon that I thought was cool. \n\nThe beginning of this year I took it a step further and bought a shikibouton style mat and mattress for the sake of being able to roll both up and put them in my closet so I can have a modular working space in my room to exercise and shit. Essentially I purposely sleep on a piece of toast like a fucking idiot. \n\nI’m honestly so over it. Even though I sleep well and get my eight hours it is fucking uncomfortable. I toss and turn constantly as the days go by and again even though my quality of sleep hasnt gone down, it hasnt gone up eother. There’s no real benefit. Im not stronger or more agile, being used to this hasnt made me more flexible or resilient… At the end of the day its just a fucking uncomfortable piece of shit bed. \n\nIt doesnt work for me anymore and I tried riding that idea of minimalist sleep horseshit for about two years now. It may offer benefits i guess for some people but I feel i get it a good honest try for two years and just get a comfortable bed ladies and gents. \n\nThere is no point in suffering through this stupid idea, learn from my mistakes.

Then your shoe expenses may not need to be as high as if you were an engineer on-site or construction worker.\n\nOr in my case, I had a job for the last few years that required me to be at work 60-80 hours a week. Since I wasn't going to be at home a lot, I made sure to not spend too much on housing and furnishings. If I were working at home, then I would spend more money on say, a desk chair, a desk, a nice monitor, and other comforts like that.\n\nOther examples:\n\n* Don't cook a lot? Get cheaper knives. Cook every meal? Get nice knives.\n* At work a lot? Don't get too many living organisms (plants, pets, children, etc). Stay-at-home person? Make your home homely with plants, a dog, and a couple kids (if these float your boat)!\n* Is it easy to take public transit to work? Get a boring used car. Have a long commute?

If your answer is \"all sides\" it's because you're in the wrong firmness and your body is having to fight to find \"whatever is comfortable at the time\".  If you're not sure what part of your body you should focus on, try to think of what position you first try to go to sleep on.\n\nStomach Sleeper = Firm\n\nBack Sleeper = Medium\n\nSide Sleeper = Soft\n\nYour pillow also affects this.  Thin pillow for stomach sleepers, moderate thickness for back sleepers, and thick pillows for side sleepers (and yes, the broadness of your shoulders does matter).\n\nYou're wanting to do anything possible to keep your spine straight.  Side sleeping on a firm bed? Your hip is being pushed up at a curve and your shoulder is being jammed into your neck.  You can offset this with body pillows but not completely.\n\nStomach sleeping in a soft bed?  You're being bent backwards for hours on end.  Your lower back hates you.  Full stop.\n\nEdit: If you're searching for a mattress for anything other than a rarely to moderately used guest bedroom or a mattress for a child under the age of 10, do not expect to get quality for less than $500.  I spent multiple entire *days* watching the most boringly narrated videos about the layers and technology in each and every mattress that came to our floor, every time we got a new brand or set.  There absolutely is a difference between them.\n\nAlso... *FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, PUT A MATTRESS PROTECTOR ON IT*.

Same with a mattress, but sleep on it right or it doesn’t matter.    \n\nDon’t be cheap and don’t cut corners on vehicle safety. If there’s a cheap car but it’s safety rating is bad don’t get it. It’s better to spend a little or wait for the right car then to drive around in a death box. And I realize not everyone has this luxury, but try to get the safest vehicle.    \n\nDesk chair, especially if you work at home or game. Best for your posture, health problems etc. It saves you money in the long run to go for that slightly more expensive chair.   \n\nDental care, it’s not really about being cheap so much as it is about cutting corners. Don’t. Dental problems are expensive. Like super expensive. Best way is to prevent cavities but if you end up with one get it tested because even if it’s a few hundred dollars now it’s cheaper than in a few months when it’s a few thousand.",

It doesn't have to be the name brand ergo stuff either, but something with good lumbar/ass support for the chair is definitely worth it. Depending on your work needs a monitor or two (if you have the space) makes a big difference for your posture. If it's at the right height then you won't be slouching as much, and having a second screen means it's much easier for some to do their work (this part really depends on what you do). Finally, an external keyboard and mouse are worth it because most laptops are fairly cramped. If you're gonna be on a laptop for 8+ hours a day it makes sense to loosen up a bit. This also helps with posture because you're not hunched over a tiny keyboard and trackpad.\n\nThe point? Posture is everything. A chair, monitor, keyboard, and mouse all make sure that your posture isn't horrendous. None of these have to be super expensive either. Are you going to enjoy a $300 keyboard and a $1000 chair? Absolutely. Will it provide a substantial increase over a $20 board or a $100 chair? No. \n\nOne last thing- fancy desks and gamer chairs are often not worth their premiums.
