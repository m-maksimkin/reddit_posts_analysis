    "LPT: College students: If you are a victim of a crime at school, call police FIRST, not the school.\nColleges and universities will try to  get you to use their \"internal\" reporting systems when something bad happens.  That system is there to help the school protect their image, not to protect you.   They will waste valuable time at best, and some may even try to talk you out of filing a police report, or they may even trick  you into reporting to a campus authority instead of to police.  If you want a  law enforcement response, get it yourself.  You can report to the  school later.  The college will have a harder time covering the crime  up if the police are already involved.\n\nSource: I have worked for multiple colleges that pull this kind of crap.\n\nBTW: This is just as true of lower level schools too.  If your kid is assaulted, threatened, or victimized in another criminal way, don't call the principal first, call police first.  Let the principal catch up later.": [

It's a federal law that we report every crime that's reported to every staff member, even if the person reporting it doesn't want to report it to the police. It's called the Clery Act. All school employees that have any regular interactions with students have to be trained every year in this. The only time they don't have to report it to police is if the student specifically doesn't want to, but we still have to report that a crime happened. \n\nEvery state employee that works with students is a mandated reporter as well. There are so many laws and things in place because schools are literally wracking their brains trying to figure out how to get more people to report. The reason they want you to report it to us isn't because they want to cover it up, it's because most of the time when a crime happens, no one reports it at all and we are trying to get people to report it more. That's literally our whole entire goa because we have less crime when you report things more.   \n\n\nThat's why  the logic doesn't make any sense.. You can absolutely always report a crime to police first and you ***never*** have to tell us, it's literally no difference to us if you want to or not. Some colleges and universities have their own police departments on campus, so if you decide to report it to the city police they'll only refer it back to the campus police department anyway.   \n\n\nBut we don't get paid more or less based on the number of crimes on campus. In fact, I'd probably have more incentive to have more crimes reported because it would make our board of directors allocate us a bigger budget. We literally have no financial or social incentive to \"cover up crime\". We're state agencies, not private businesses. We don't get paid based on effectiveness.. And students are attracted to schools based on how good they are, almost no one looks at the ASR. I know, I manage ours. I have literally never had anyone request it for the past 8 years.   \n\n\nI get the whole, \"adults don't give a shit about us\" mentality. But believe it or not your smaller college or university has more invested in you, a lot more time for you, and a lot more resources to offer you if you've had something traumatic happen to you, than your local PD.",

A lot of public universities have campus police that are actual police. Calling 911 will often reroute to campus police because they are police.\n\nThis whole thing about campuses covering things up comes from a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding about how higher education works. Of course there's plenty of shady stuff that can and actively does happen behind the scenes, and that's inexcusable. We should hold those people accountable. With that said, if you trust calling 911, you should trust calling campus police because they are usually the same thing. Just do your own research on your school if you're unsure.\n\nIf you're worried about campuses covering things up, just look up the Violence Against Women Act (Clery Act), and you'll see that schools are more inclined to know about and handle an issue rather than \"cover it up.\" Also, when it comes to sexual assault, become familiar with Title IX and its processes. Almost everything that is or isn't reported is on the student to do themselves. Reporting is a scary and difficult thing to do. It's even harder/scarier to pursue an investigation. But you should definitely seek out your school's Title IX office or representative if you are sexually assaulted in some way. They can do more than investigate like offer you resources both provided on and off campus. Make the decisions that are best for you.\n\nI'm not defending bad things that happen at schools or the mishandling of situations by the schools. When things go bad, we should be angry, we should seek accountability. It just helps if you actually know what you're talking about when it comes to this stuff. Most of what I've mentioned applies to state schools, so ymmv with private colleges. Just do additional research as needed.",

It wasn't just keyed panels and slashed tires; she busted all the windows, carved up the interior, and ripped/cut any cable or hose she could get to. Not to mention putting definitely not gas in it. All in the school parking lot, during class. Girl A had got to school late for reasons and girl B saw her come in just after lunch. Girl B used her connectedness to be allowed outside (which is banned for any student not connected) to do the damage. Girl A saw what she was doing but, as someone not connected, couldn't get out.\n\nAfter it was all done, she went to the office and asked for help. There she was told the administration would deal with it. She began to call the sheriff to get a report filed but was quickly stopped and told she wasn't allowed to do that. The administration would handle it. After crying for about 10 minutes she left the office and came to our class to seek out our teacher, who is distinctly and uniquely a decent human being, for comfort. And that's when the part mentioned before, us convincing her to get the police report and ignore the office, came in.\n\nEventually she did. I never got the full epilogue, but it was at least paid for. Outside of those possible monetary things Girl B received no punishment.\n\nGirl A got suspended for a while, ostensibly because she came to our class rather than her scheduled class. Though I should note that her class wasn't a standard class and she was free to roam the school (don't remember, newspaper or yearbook or something), since she never went to the classroom itself to check in, despite the teacher not being there to check in with, she technically broke the rules. While this is why she was suspended, administration reminded her multiple times that she should be careful when messing with other people's relationships, the office could have handled things better and the police can potentially make her school life difficult, and it is nice to practice self-control around men.\n\nGuy got in trouble but not suspended for \"cyberbullying\" and \"bullying\", by causing drama and toying with Girl B, taking advantage of her kindness. It was mentioned that he should be less promiscuous. He, as they said, was primarily responsible for the situation as the male and therefore the one making decisions. The females simply responded to his actions.\n\nSome time after the event, we were all reminded (coincidentally) that any dangerous situations or interpersonal relationship issues should be reported to the office. The secretary, to be specific. After that was done, the secretary would pass the issue up to the principal. They would then decide if the school counselor was needed to address the issue. This was to be the first response, and no student should call outside authorities without the permission of the administration, for the student's safety.\n\nBONUS: The Guy getting in trouble for \"cyberbullying\" was based off of a private message group on Facebook, where he said he wasn't interested in Girl B. That was that. It was a large group and had one of the administration's mole accounts added in. This used the precedent set a few years earlier when someone got suspended, similarly, for cyberbullying by saying he didn't like (but didn't have any problem with) another student who was not in the group chat (though a mole account was).\n\nNotice: While I was only present for the end of this situation, I heard segments of the story from multiple largely un-connected sources. This is sticker together from their various recollections. Not all of them even knew much of the story when it happened.

Colleges are required by law to release an annual crime statistics report for their campus. It’s public so people can know what kind of crimes have occurred on campus. If the school has a bunch of crimes reported, it obviously makes the school look bad and unsafe. \n\nSchools are known to do their own investigation regarding alleged campus crimes that are a violation of the student code of conduct, regardless of and independent of charges/conviction. \n\nI don’t think that schools outright discourage students from making police reports so much as they lead students to believe that their best source of support, guidance and justice is through the school. For support sure, but for justice- that needs to be in the hands of the law. At my school, they were constantly telling us how campus police was an under-used resource and were obsessed with safety. There was no clear corruption that I observed, but I have no doubt that they ultimately have the interests of the school ahead of the victims. \n\nI’m sure there are plenty of blatantly corrupt schools out there who discourage victims from reporting crimes to LE and that’s completely unacceptable.

Our staff took this VERY seriously and I felt handled it better than police could. Police were more often backup for our jobs. For drug cases, I would only call the police if there was obvious intent to sell, weapons, or suspicious objects / non-students living in the room. Otherwise, guaranteed jail time versus school conduct systems is what students were looking at. For reported abuse cases, students were IMMEDIATELY separated physically and interviewed by staff. Police were contacted if necessary AND students and staff were encouraged to file police reports in some cases. If the school conduct system is incompetent that’s a different story. If not a life or death, urgent, or time-sensitive, please contact university staff. They’re specifically trained to keep your concern confidential and handle it as best as possible.

So why not call them if at a college?\n4. in some cases the police will protect the 'state' when in fact their real job is to protect the citizens who pay for them, via tax, and that should be their primary focus.\n5. Police forces should not be controlled by the state and only receive funding. Their could be committees that are made up of ordinary citizens and professionals that govern the police force - without any monetary gains through their decisions - other than getting a payment for their time.\n6. one comment mentioned that a person should have been reported to the police so that if they did such bad actions again it was already on record and that is why one should, try, to report to the police as the authorised carers.\n7. keep a record of all your activities when calling the police/security - be consciously active if you can in the moment.\n\njust some of my thoughts when reading the post and the great comments - some great advice here",

And I know it is stupid but I was expecting that he could just talk with perpetrator and tell him to stay away from me or something in that line. It couldn't have gone more wrong. Professor was obliged to report the incident by law or something and I had to go to different officials of the university and explain the situation in shock and tears over and over again. I think it was 3-4 different officials.  Also all this was 3-4 days before my final exams. So additional to having stress of the schoolwork I had all of this on top of it. It was horrible. But I will tell you what the initial sexual harassment incident wasn't the one which left me shook till this day( although I was terrified at that time)  it was the incident with one of the university officials. When I expressed that I don't feel safe around perpetrator and being told that he is basically going to get away with what he did I was basically shut down. The university offical basically talked over me, raised his voice, grinned in some cases while I was expressing my disagreement shook and crying( I think for him it was more a game or something) and more( i will spare you detailes). After that I asked to be heard by another offical who works in the same office and while telling my disagreement about how perpetrator is going to get away with what he did I told them about the incident with the precious university official(UO). And you know what 2 people in the room did. Nothing. They looked more uncomfortable about hearing the incident with UO than concerned about what I was telling. I believe till this day that UO got away and hasn't been even told off about how he treated me in his office. After that I just tried to forget everything and move on but obviously  couldn't. I though thousands of times about writing a letter  to the President of the University or do something about that but it just sends me into spiral of anxiety and panic. My current health situation doesn't help with this either. I don't know what to do anymore. I hate that UO got away with what he did. And probably he is out there doing it to another student or worse. I asked for help and advice from people around me and they also don't know what is best to do in this situation. It has been more than 2 years and I don't know weather there is any point in bringing this up again and again. But it still hurts. I can not forget about it or just brush it off. I believe my current health situation also adding to it and that's why I can't process it. And please be kind if you decide to leave a comment.🙏 I am willing to answer questions in a respectful manner. Thank you for reading.",
