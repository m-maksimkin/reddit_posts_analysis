    "LPT: I'm 43. By your late 20's/early 30's, make sure physical fitness becomes an absolute top priority.\nI started a dedicated fitness regimen when I was 28 to improve my odds with a girl. Didn't work on the girl. What did work was that the routine stuck. Now pushing my mid-forties, I can't believe where I am physically compared to many others my age. Also scary is how they regard physical deterioration as an inevitability. It isn't. Get started now. It will be one of the greatest gifts you'll ever give yourself.": [

You burn approximately the same amount of calories in a 1 hour workout as you do in a nights sleep (about 500-750 calories, for each).

I've seen significant improvements in my strength, muscle mass, body composition, and overall energy and well-being, but I'm never going to be Mr. Olympia or anything and I still have some stubborn flab around my gut that I just can't seem to get rid of.

            "text": "I'll be 29 in a couple months and I'm starting to feel the effects of a mostly sedentary lifestyle. I work mostly at a desk all day then I come home and watch TV or play video games. I'm honestly not really that out of shape, but I'm starting to develop a bit of a dad bod. My old clothes are all getting a little too tight to wear, I've got some minor back/neck pain like all the time, I get winded really easily.\n\nProblem is, I absolutely *despise* working out. I tried going to a gym a few times when I was fresh out of high school and I just hated it. I was miserable the whole time and then I was sweaty and gross, and all I could think about was how much time I was spending on being miserable when I could be doing other things I actually enjoy, like working through  my enormous backlog of games, movies, tv shows, books, etc at home.\n\nI also love eating unhealthy stuff too much.  I put cheese on like everything and drink milk or sweet tea with almost every meal, I love ice cream, I love pastas, I love greasy foods like pizza and burgers and fried chicken. I love gummy candies and sweets. I honestly think sometimes I would rather die than have to give all that up for the rest of my life. Not only that, but I don't like cooking or food prep, and eating healthier would mean more time doing that sort of thing. It's so much easier and less time consuming to make a pot roast or chili in a crock pot, or throw a frozen meal in the microwave.\n\nAs a single dude living on my own til now, I haven't really had a whole lot of motivation to improve myself. But now that I've got a girlfriend that I would like to eventually settle down with, I'm starting to think more about my future. I want to still be able to do stuff with my kids, assuming I end up having them. But whenever I think about cracking down on my eating and fitness, it just seems so intimidating. I dread the thought of working out. I dread the thought of giving up my favorite eats. I dread how much money it would cost me to get a gym membership, or buy workout equipment, and buy and cook healthier foods.\n\nI recognize all these issues mostly stem from a lack of self control and laziness. I do want to start correcting it, but I know I just can't jump in headfirst. I'd quit after the first day. What can I do to maybe ease into it a little more? What are some smaller things I could maybe do from home for short periods of time without needing to buy equipment that would actually be at least somewhat effective? How much of my diet would I really need to change? I don't really feel the need to get super muscly or anything, I just want to avoid future health problems and gain a bit more stamina.",

I don’t think I can even kneel down like that without it hurting”. He’s only 33 years old. I laughed and said “well, my leg might be a little numb when I stand up, but it doesn’t hurt”.

These are the inevitable outcome for anyone who is lucky enough to grow old/older.\n\nOf course, we should all make the effort to be as active as possible, and keep weight off.

I will never like exercise, but I will always love the end result. I don't do it for others, I don't do it for some silly intangible benefit like looking good; I do it because after I'm done, I know I'll feel better.\n\nPeople have remarked on how I look so much better and all the other accompanying comments, and say they wish they could *motivate* themselves to do something about it. **Motivation is shit.

Mix them up. Do 4-5 of them per day. No need to do a ton of fancy stuff. Work on form though more than weights. \n\nGo every day. Don't stay long.

My friends were shocked and couldn’t fathom biking that long of a distance, but cause i kept active for my whole life so far, it wasn’t hard.

Not only is it essential to build up of your past performance, but it’s highly rewarding in a few months/years when you look back and go “damn, I’m a beast!” \n\n-you don’t always just keep adding and adding weight. Once in a while (I say a ratio of a few days for every month) you need to Deload. This isn’t the same as a rest day. It’s a weekish workout, but you’re significantly cutting down on the weight and volume. Your body needs to catch up, recover and grow, and giving it the time to do so will maintain long term progress. For some reason, I come back really damn strong after 2-3 days of nothing. \n\n-start now! Especially if you are young! Your best years are here and you will have the most of your peak years. It gives you a load of confidence and break from every day stresses. \n\n-try different things out! Not only different sports, but also at the gym. Like bodybuilding (getting big and sculpting yourself), powerlifting (getting super duper strong and bulky too. Really nice if you like pushing yourself), powerbuilding, CrossFit, weightlifting. You might find something that becomes your passion, like it did to me. \n\n-love yourself and don’t be too hard!",

            "text": "As a fellow 43yo, who is in the best “shape” of my life—even though over the years fitness was at the center several times—I agree to an extent. Physical health is definitely important, but until I got my mental health together, my physical didn’t matter. For everyone else, who would see me fluctuate, they used how I appeared to judge their degree of support, based on how they “perceived” I was doing. Most of the time my fitness was great was when my mental health suffered the most, but because I “appeared” okay it was difficult to get anyone to care.\n\nIt wasn’t until the beginning of the pandemic, when I lost everything due to addressing my mental health, that I put my emotional needs first, and the weight started melting off. Currently I’m at my lowest weight in more than 20 years, and dropped the pounds mostly with walking. People look at me and assume I’m much younger, and that I have some strict diet/workout schedule, but I don’t—yet. Because I’ve survived and bounced back from some wild events (outside of pandemic and social issues), my focus is shifting to more cardio and muscle defining activities. \n\nWhat I learned is that it’s never too late. Never. Someone can be in their 50s and decide to get their health in order—as long as their mental health aligns—it will benefit them. However, if they have ulterior motives, like impressing someone else or fitting in, it will be difficult regardless of their age.",

            "text": "I’m 42. 6’1” 205lbs. I’ve run outside for exercise on and off over the years. Occasionally indoors on a treadmill but I prefer outside. Sometimes I’ll run 2-3 days a week for 6-9 months, then winter (rain) will come (Vancouver) and I’ll stop. Sometimes I won’t run again for 6 months and will slowly gain some weight, before starting the routine again. I’ve worn 34” waist pants since I was 22, so I figure that’s a good sign of stable weight and body shape. Mentally and physically I still feel 20 something. No aches and pains. Don’t get winded going up stairs. Just spent two days skiing all over Whistler 5-6 hrs/day and wasn’t particularly sore. My problem is that I do it because you have to and are supposed to so you don’t die young, but I don’t actually like the act of doing it. Never have. It’s more self discipline than pleasure. \n\nWhen covid hit, I was 40 and started working from home. To manage stress and get out I started running again, a lot. Forrest Gump styles. Mostly to manage my anxiety around what was happening with covid in March/April 2020. I started running more and more until it was 4-5 miles (6-8km) 3-5 times per week. Over the next 12 months and over the course of 150-175 runs I got into the best shape of my life. I felt like a fucking beast. I threw down a 10km in 51min and could bust out a sub 8:00 mile with ease. I tracked my runs with Runkeeper and I ran about 1000km in total over the first year of covid, which basically stretches from Vancouver to the northern California border. Hard to believe I ran my ass from BC to Cali, one step at a time. \n\nI suffered an ankle injury that took me out of commission for several months in late 2021 and haven’t really found my way back to it yet outside of 1-2 runs per month. Need to find my motivation again and get back out there. The other way lies poor health and poor life outcomes. I’m also trying to make up for years (decades) of too much partying and throwing caution to the wind, which I fear has done permanent damage that will come back to get me prematurely. Hopefully running will keep that at bay as long as possible. I had one friend drop dead at 39. He never exercised and it showed and ultimately took his life. It’s hard to make the time, but it’s the only way to get the results you want. You have to make it a priority. Always easier said than done. It’s an ongoing struggle, even for me, who has run on and off for 25 years. Sometimes you just don’t wanna go. You always feels better if you do. Putting on the shoes and just going is key. As they say in prison (so I’ve heard), do your time, don’t let your time do you. Your body and mind will thank you. I need to go take my own advice and get my ass off this couch and go clock a few miles. I doubt that I’ll ever “want” to, but if I don’t, the outcomes are likely to be poor and the regrets high. You only get one go around. Never too late to start.",

People who train 6 days a week (which gives you a pretty basic alternating three days of strength and three days of endurance training) will get concerned looks and prying questions about whether they are maybe overdoing it a little from people who just by looking in a mirror should be able to tell that they have no business giving lifestyle advice.\n\nWe have normalized fatness to such a degree that it’s expected.",

More so seeing some of my friends constantly throwing out their backs or not being able to walk long distances. \n\nAccording to the CDC  you need to move 150 minutes of activity a [week](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm) as an adult.\n\nHere's how I started slowly. \n\n- 30 minutes jogging on tread mill\n\n- lifting small weights in multiple reps (30 minutes)\n\n- 60 minutes walking throughout the rest of the day (at random but I keep a tracker on me)\n\n5 days a week, arms day, abs day, legs day, stretch day and \"around the world\" day (all of those combined in one smaller set of sets and stretches)\n\nAlso yoga, but restorative yoga can help after the workout.\n\nEventually I got to an elliptical rather than a treadmill, I moved to heavier weights with less reps to begin building muscle.\n\nIt takes a lot of mental strength for the first 30 days but, after that your muscle memory kicks in and you just keep going.\n\nAlso ditch junk food, less sugars and change breakfast to a post workout protein shake if you're going in the morning. Protein shake after the workout helps.",

Cutting food portion size also makes a massive difference; eat when you're hungry, only just enough though (don't try to stuff yourself). When you feel snackish, eat a big salad with fewer carbs (croutons, cheese, etc.) and more protein (tuna, chicken, etc).

Needless to say i was devastated and got this crazy idea that I'd show her what she was missing (yes i cringe even admitting that and yes it's perfectly ok to question my mental state at the time). So i started walking, then lifting weights, and before i knew it i had a 5 1/2 pack (almost made it) and believe or not i even managed to get her back. For all of a month but couldn't give up on her highschool crush. \n\nfunny thing though, i ended up dating his girlfriend (who also happened to be the head cheerleader and my ex secretly hated) and after finding out ahe thought it was her chance... And he shot her down after she asked. I didn't plan or tried to make that scenario happen, we just happened to talk a lot during gatherings, but honestly that just made for the sweetest revenge just a little more sweeter.\n\n Then I had surgery on my knee and let my daily routine slide and honestly that right there was the dumbest thing I did at the time.\n\nGirl aside, i was in the best shape of my life! I jog an hour every single day (mostly because I did it long enough i actually loved doing it), could lift more than any of my coworkers, and had tons of energy. But the most important thing was that happened years before my bipolar disorder was properly diagnosed and treated so the exercise is what truly kept me from mentally crashing and burning. My biggest regret was nit going straight back to my daily routine right way because know I'm in horrible shape and I've been trying to turn it around but it's not so much willpower at this point but rather it's almost impossible to get a routine going without causing some form of injury or muli-day pain. I honestly don't think I'd be this bad of right now if i had even just gone back to only 1/3 of my daily routine. \n\nIf i could change only one thing in my past it would be to going back to 2 weeks post surgery and paddle locking wrist weights on myself for a few weeks!",

            "text": "Good morning,\n\nYou have some good advice here. I used to be at the top of my game until I reached my late 40's. I used to ride my bike 200- 300 miles a week. I used to walk 4-8 miles a day. I loved the outdoors, hiking in the mountains, sports...  I was born with epilepsy and so most of my getting around was on foot or riding my bike or I depended on friends and public transportation.  I did not mind at all! After I got married and had kids and worked and exercised, I reached my late 40's , I started having lower back pains, and I had learned that I had to stop riding my bike. Because If I did not, I would lose the use of my back, I had stage 4 degenerative disc disease, I could end up in a wheelchair. So I went and started walking 4- 8 miles every day. After many years of walking, my feet were falling and I started walking on my ankles. I went in to see about what was going on. Doc sad good thing you got in here when you did! Another 6 months to a year, you might not have had any feet to walk on. You need to have corrective surgery.  So now, it has almost been a year since I have had surgery on one foot, and now I might have to schedule surgery for the other foot. \n\nMy suggestion is to live a strong and healthy life. Do not overdo the exercise. Enjoy, your life and the exercise that you do. I loved my biking and walking and hiking and all the other sports... Do what you can that fits for your age and health.  Enjoy your life! God bless!",

I let the pain stop me from exercising for a few years and got up to 285lbs (I'm 6'4\"). When my doctor told me that I would eventually need both knees replaced and my weight was speeding that up, I got serious about fitness. I did elliptical and swimming combined with very low weight/high rep dumbbell workouts, as well as an intermittent fasting plan. After 6 months, I was down to 250 and now, one year after starting, I'm at a comfortable 220, which was my military weight. I feel so much better, younger, more energetic, mentally healthier, and I've got much reduced pain levels in my joints. Don't wait - get moving now, no matter your age!",
