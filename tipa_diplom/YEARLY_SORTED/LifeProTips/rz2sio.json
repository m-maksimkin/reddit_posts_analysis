The thing is, it's entirely possible to filter bias from an article and still take in whatever information might be contained therein.\n\nThe fact that it's easy to tell if something is biased is a really big clue that *bias isn't the worst thing to find in your news*. You can look at the facts as presented, and then at the way they are presented, and immediately develop an understanding of the bias contained therein. You can filter the bias out with very little effort.\n\nWhat you *cannot* immediately do is tell when a source is lying outright. To do that, you need to fact check, which requires a lot more effort.\n\nBecause bias is so easy to spot, we talk about it a lot, and a lot of people seem to have gotten the impression that bias is The Big Evil in media.\n\nBecause misinformation is comparatively more difficult to discern, people tend to behave as if they can substitute bias, as if the presence of bias were evidence of misinformation. It isn't.\n\nInstead, I would suggest people DO read such articles, and make an effort to identify the ways that bias is presented, build those reading comprehension skills, and by all means judge the author harshly if you like. By avoiding something easy to spot, not only are you not going to gain any such skill, you're likely to begin to subconsciously believe that your preferred—and apparently unbiased—sources are telling the truth.
