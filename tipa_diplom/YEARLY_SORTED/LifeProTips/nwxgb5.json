This goes for everything from productivity to weight-loss. If you have a day where you don't work hard or fail at the diet or whatever, don't try and work twice as hard or diet twice as much the next day, because you burn out. The day after the 'catch-up day' becomes a 'failure day' again because you overdid it to catch up. Then you get into the habit of overworking then underworking alternately, which is both less productive and more tiring than maintaining a good level.\n\nIf you 'miss' a day, or a quarter of a day, then that period is missed, it's just that. It was time not spent towards to goal but that's okay, make the next day (or quarter) good again, not to catch-up, just get back to normal working level and take the lost period as sunk. \n\nThis mentality is better for you long term because it stops you being able to justify lost days with \"I'll catch up\" (you won't), *and* it stops you worrying on planned rest days about \"but I could be working\" because they're part of not over-doing it. \n\nSometimes a deadline is a deadline and 'catching up' is unavoidably necessary. Life will definitely conspire this way sometimes and that's okay as well. But a cycle of missed days then overworked days will break you while also causing you to be further from your goal than maintenance (whatever level maintenance means for you personally) achieves. Find what you can sustain and try to work that hard in each working moment, letting the times you didn't manage to work at that fade into the past, not letting them make you feel like you need to work harder.",
