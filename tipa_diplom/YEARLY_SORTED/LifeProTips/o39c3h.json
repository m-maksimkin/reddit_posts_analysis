    "LPT: Never compliment someone for losing weight unless you know it’s intentional. I once told a coworker he looked great after he lost a little weight. He looked sad afterwards. I didn’t understand why. I found out later he had terminal cancer. I never comment on anyone’s weight now.\nEdit: I’m just saying don’t lead with “you look great!” Say “wow! Great to see you! What have you been up to?” People will usually respond with an answer that lets you know if they have changed their lifestyle. Then you can say “yeah! You look amazing” \nI’m a super nice person. Not a jerk for those of you saying I’m a robot or making mean comments or saying I should have known the difference. Wow.\nThis man had just lost maybe 7-10lbs. It was early on in his illness. He eventually get losing weight and passed away...\nSo I was giving this life tip so people aren’t haunted like I am. In that moment I reminded him he was dying and I hurt him.": [

She couldn't eat, sleep without medication, let alone sleep in her own bed for months because that's where it all had started, she could hardly function and she had absolutely nothing left in her. When she'd try to talk, all she could do was cry. I remember one time I was leaving for work and came downstairs at 5 am and she was just sitting on the couch crying and it broke my heart that I couldn't help her. That was 4 years ago and I still tear up talking about it because she was in such a bad place and I was so afraid that I'd come home to find her dead. Long story short, at this time she was a lil on the heavier side and she lost 15 pounds in a few weeks. All her clients (she does hair) and coworkers kept saying how great she looked and how happy they were to see her working hard to take care of herself, which is pretty fucked up to say unprovoked, and it just made her feel worse about herself. After that I can't bring myself to comment on anyone's weight unless they talk about it because I saw how it hurt her and how she had to play it off that I'm forever nervous about doing that to someone else.

I tried everything I could, but it was hormonal, so what I really needed was birth control - which I couldn’t get because it was *Texas* and I was poor with no insurance. I was super self-conscious about it, so I wore makeup to try and make it less noticeable, which only made it worse. And like I said, I tried everything - benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid wash, Korean skin care method, clay masks, honey, etc. - I was more than diligent about taking care of my skin. I could have been a goddamn esthetician. \n\n\nAnd *every single fucking day* at work, one or more customers would comment on it, or give me a suggestion of something I have either tried about 90 times, or something that would be horrible for my skin because they’re idiots. I guess people were trying to be helpful, but in reality it just destroyed my self-esteem and made me really neurotic about wearing makeup at ALL times. \n\n\nSo yeah, no matter what it is and how helpful you think you are being, *do not* comment on other people’s bodies.

I got really sick and lost a lot of weight and that’s all anyone commented on, and it was so hard because they would say it in this excited congratulatory way, and yet I was dying inside.

Alice was naturally of average build and still had a little bit of ‘baby fat’ I guess you could call it but she definitely was not overweight. We were 14/15 so everyone had just started going through puberty. Art lessons were only once per week and Alice sat in front of me. One week I noticed she looked like she had lost a bit of weight. I didn’t think anything of it and just thought her body was starting to even out with puberty. But each week she looked thinner and thinner. A couple of weeks since I first noticed the weight loss my art teacher said “wow Alice, you look amazing, have you been loosing weight?” Alice said yes thank you. And the teacher said “well done, good for you!”. As a 14 year old even I could see something was obviously seriously wrong, this was not normal weight loss. A couple of weeks later her parents pulled her out of school and it was confirmed she had anorexia, and they sent her to a treatment facility. She had only been eating a small amount of salad per day and exercising excessively.\nI will always remember how disgusted I felt at that teacher for her comments, she was literally encouraging anorexia in a child! It’s one of the reasons why I will never comment on someone’s weight as you never know what’s going on in their life. I was never friends with ‘Alice’ but from what I’ve seen on social media she seems to be doing a lot better now.",

Like, I know we are societally conditioned to praise it, but it just throws how they must have thought about you before and will if the weight comes back into focus. I'm actually really sick of being told how awesome it is. It's the first thing people say to me after seeing me for the first time in a year like yeah nice to see you too. I know some people are the opposite of me, though, and I don't hold it against them but its just. Very individual.\n\nAnd if you know someone has been really intentionally trying, you dont know what their relationship is with weightloss. Compliments on weight loss can mess with eating disorders and body dysmorphia too. But so can the lack of them\n\nThere's really no easy answer here. I'd say just. Try not to focus too much on a person's weight, up or down, unless they bring it up, and even then, try not to make it sound like its the most important or biggest thing about a person and what they've been doing.\n\nLike. I'd prefer people ask me about walking more, or cooking, than tell me I look great and whatever I'm doing is working.

I felt uncomfortable, but I worsened my internal reaction as it was the first time I've lied about why I might've lost weight (in other words, I don't know if I actually have or if I have, there's a specific reason why) and provided some form of explanation of it.\n\nThe weight loss, if I have lost weight might've been because I've been eating a lot less, as in limited or no comfort eating, and that's the truth; I've eliminated a lot of extra food or meals beyond my two or three full meals, and I've rarely been snacking. But it was a lie because I have no idea if they've made that kind of a difference, as many people have commented the same thing.\n\nThe other reason I have trouble handling comments like that, or even physical compliments on specifics of my appearance, is because I have body issues going back to when I was in my teens; eating what I was fed and was made available for me for eating was very difficult for me and I was exceptionally underweight until I was almost 20. I began binge eating (not purging) when I started having enough money to buy my own food, usually burgers and fries, lots of sugars and fats and greasy foods.\n\nThat, coupled with physical, verbal and emotional bullying through the entirety of my developmental years, has made it very difficult since then for me to accept compliments on my appearance, having come to expect such comments to be lies and insults wrapped in a thin layer of supposition of honesty.\n\nI do not think I am particularly ugly  or unattractive nor that I present myself as unkempt, and I take reasonably good care of my hygiene. But I do not know how to accept or process comment on my appearance or attractiveness, the mental machinery inside of me does not know what to do with them and will almost always end up with my being frustrated and upset.",
