    "LPT: When You are Done Drinking Alcohol For the Night, Start Drinking Lots of Water\nThe major reason for nausea and hang-over effects from drinking is dehydration.  The body requires a lot of water to flush the toxins from your system.  After you're done drinking alcohol, if you start drinking plenty of water (even though you probably won't feel like it), it will greatly mitigate the negative effects from over indulgence.": [

As it breaks alcohol down and continue to dump the enzymes to break what its byproduct is - methylacetate iirc (yes, basically nail polish remover, its the thing that causes cirrhosis) - you will continue to be blocked out of meaningful hydration. Some people have the gene for overdrinking where it dumps alcohol directly into the intestinal tract for overflow processing, and the intestine is much less effective and efficient and causes cytokine build up more significantly and is really just delaying the alcohol getting back into your blood to have the liver take another whack at it. Drink a lot and dont feel drunk? Thats a really bad sign and you need to curb your drinking because your body won't be giving you the warning signs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, if youre at the point where youre creating strategies to not have crippling hangovers, I highly suggest you find a way to stop the transition from livin' to drink to drinking to live. Alcohol is a drug and is **used.** You **use** alcohol just like you would any drug. There is use, misuse, and abuse and thinking of it as a drug that costs the U.S economy more than heroin (and almost just all the drugs combined) does from its impact on society should make you pause when it comes to our favorite party drug.

            "text": ">The body requires a lot of water to flush the toxins from your system.\n\nBollocks. The general tip is actually fine, but saying stuff like this makes water sound like the elixir of life or stuff like that. \n\nDrugs (medical and non) are almost all toxins our body needs to eliminate sooner or later, but many don't involve dehydration, nor need a higher intake of water to be eliminated. For a lot of drugs it's way more useful to eat than to drink, because food will rise the pH level in your stomach significantly better than water, making the acid less strong thus less likely to attack the drug (which is why some drugs are only recommended after a meal). \n\nFilling your stomach with fluid only could also very easily trigger a vomit response with drugs that have nausea as a side effect. Don't drink tons of water if you had aspirin or ibuprofen for example, you'll probably end up throwing up. Alcohol most definitely causes nausea, **please keep in mind that throwing up while high/drunk is one of the most dangerous things you could do**, many people more intelligent than you died choking on their own vomit while shit faced drunk. \n\nThis tip is true for alcohol specifically because alcohol is a diuretic substance and actually actively causes dehydration, thus making you thirsty (and making you pee a lot), and the usual response of the average drunk person to thirst is drinking more alcohol. Drinking water when you're drunk is useful to put up for the dehydration and to actually satisfy your thirst, stopping that vicious circle from getting worse and worse, but this does not work for any drug. \n\nWater is not a magic potion that cleans your body from toxins and when in doubt, one less drink is always better than a fuckton of water to make up for it. \n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk.",

The best way to avoid methanol is, as a rule of thumb, to drink as clear and colourless as possible. Eg, white wine is better than red, vodka is better than whisky, and pilsner is better than stout. And for the love of god, avoid brandy at all costs. \n\nSadly, alcohol is metabolized by your liver, not your kidneys, so all the water in the world won’t speed up the pain.\n\nGood luck out there on New Years!",

That and dehydration. But that’s totally half the answer \n\nFrom what I gather, Pills have been developed that help the body eliminate and process this toxin by upping the amounts of a precursor to the substance that helps the body eliminate/process the toxin. I think, the body doesn’t have to make as much precursor / part of the chemical required . I assume that makes return to normal quicker, it would make sense that it’d make us more efficient…. If one didn’t have to wait for the body to replenish that requisite component of the required substance that helps us eliminate the built up toxin. I forget the name of it, really easy to Google tho \n\nAlso apparently women react better to this exogenous introduction of requisite substance. They tend to see better effects when taking this “anti hangover” substance. I read about it a couple times, but I may have gotten a detail wrong somewhere. So I suggest you do your own reading lol, I don’t drink so IDGAF.\n\nWomen also tend to break down the initial toxin better in most cases\n\nI suggest reading gender studies on differences between men and women in alcohol processing related to toxin (acetaldehyde) buildup and to blood levels of ethanol and obviously on gender differences in hangovers when extended or instant release L-cysteine is used as a hangover “cure”. I did read women rate less nausea and dizziness and fatigue when they get the same amount of l-cysteine compared to\nMen. \n\nNote on actual chemicals/ enzymes whatever: Acetium capsules include 100mg of natural amino acid as an active ingredient. L-cysteine reacts with acetaldehyde, forming harmless 2-methylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (MTCA) and thus reducing the amount of acetaldehyde in the stomach.",

Its funny reading the comments below about electrolytes, Gatorade, vitamins, bread at a party (?), water after every pint and so on during a night out to curtail the effects of drinking. If you want to curtail the effects of drinking, just drink less or don't drink at all. In Ireland, you go out, drink as much as you want and enjoy it. People open up, lose their inhibitions, meet people and have fun. The next day you endure the hangover like a penance. It's a badge of honour to suffer the hangover the next day - the worse the hangover, the better the night before. You can try to recover by a) having a big full Irish breakfast (look it up) and lying on the couch all day watching TV or b) having a big full Irish breakfast and going out for \"the cure\",  going to a quiet pub and having between 5 - 8 more pints with friends before going home to sleep it off. \n\nNow I know this might not be everyone's solution on how to manage the effects of your alcoholic consumption but it is definitely common in Ireland. And Ireland is a very fun place to go out in. But if you're preplanning how you're going to manage your hangover the next day with vitamins, electrolytes, etc  you will have a clear head in the morning but you won't get invited to the after party at closing time ..",

Our bodies try to reach equilibrium when we introduce exogenous chemicals, like alcohol, into our systems. To counteract the depressant effects on our nervous systems that a GABA agonist brings, our bodies use stimulating stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol; they basically keep us breathing while we party. \n\nNow, those neurosteroids have a significant half life,longer than that of alcohol. When the alcohol is gone and you sober up, those chemicals are still there, causing undesirable effects. These effects are a hangover. Extreme vasoconstriction causes headaches and an inability for the body to regulate temperature, leading to hyperthermic symptoms like nausea and cold sweats. Hangovers can be so severe that these symptoms can kill you if not treated. \n\nEventually the stress hormones leave our system and we get very fatigued. \n\nHangovers are essentially GABA agonist withdrawal symptoms. If y’all want to know how to fix a hangover, just look up how benzodiazepine withdrawal is treated.\n\nHangovers are treated with more GABA agonists; alcohol is a great one. Just drink a bit and the hangover will cease. Then, slowly sober up. \n\nHangovers can be completely avoided by refraining from sobering up too quickly. Full stop. \n\nAlso, don’t drink too much water. It will throw off your electrolyte balance and make you feel like shit. Don’t believe me? Try it.
