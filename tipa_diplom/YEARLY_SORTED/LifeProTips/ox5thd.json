As I passed him, his brake lights came on, so I knew he was pulling out. \n\nBefore he had a chance to pull out...I pulled over. He pulled up, came up to window, slightly chuckling and said \"I've been doing this for 10+ years and have never had someone pull themselves over... As long as you aren't wanted for murder or anything, I'm gonna let you go. Let me just run you real quick\".\n\nHe came back, said I was good to go and that he wished everyone took responsibility like that, told me to slow down, and enjoy the night. \n\nI've repeated that same tactic several times with near similar results each time 🤷‍♂️  Also, my car definitely stands out in the noise department, as it has a fully built engine and is procharged, so I'm sure I draw more attention than in my grey Suzuki Aerio, lol.

Traffic court already assumes you’re guilty and will do anything they can to keep you from going to court where admitting guilt during the stop actually matters. Every officer will be different but you’re better off being cordial and giving them a blanket apology to avoid getting the ticket in the first place. If you still get a ticket and can make it to court, the DA will then work with you on a smaller fine and getting rid of points. If you plead “not guilty”, the magistrate will then try to get you to plead no contest by lowering the fine and removing points. If you still plead “not guilty” your lawyer will then work with the DA to avoid court. This is for minor infractions.

            "text": "Hmm. One time as a kid I was grounded during summer break but was too young to be at home on my own. So I rode with my father as he did his route back when he worked for H. H. Greggs. Being in a large company van, at least back then, made you a target. This was before dashcams and cell phones so the driver would almost always make the situation worse if you tried to point out that you weren't breaking the law.\n\nWe were pulled over and the officer came to the window. Took the license and proof he had permission to drive the vehicle. The cop was in a mood. He mentioned that dispatch had let him know that my father hadn't had a ticket in over 15 years so he was well overdue for another one. This was also a time when Click-it-or-Ticket was being pushed hard I believe. \n\nThe cop asked my father if he'd been wearing his seatbelt. My father was the type of person where the car didn't move until everyone was buckled up. My father said he always wears his seatbelt, especially since not doing so would set a bad example for me.\n\nThe cop (paraphasing cause it was a long time ago) said obviously he hadn't made himself clear. Was my father driving without wearing a seat belt or was he speeding, which is a moving violation (one that can get your license taken away). It was my father's choice. Obviously he chose the not being buckled up. He even had my father unbuckle the seat belt while he wrote the ticket. Ugh. Then it was \"you have a real nice day now\".\n\nEven that far back, there were limiters put on vehicles to limit how fast they could go to avoid being pulled over or speeding to the next house that needed something repaired so the estimated time given to the customer was at least in the same zip code of accurate.\n\nDunno what happened after. My father had to turn around, go back to where we'd started the day from, and submit a bunch of paper work. No idea of what, if anything, happened.",

Apparently you are expected to slow down to the speed limit by the time you reach the slower speed limit sign if the speed is decreasing, but you cannot start increasing your speed before the sign if the limit  is increasing. So we could not argue that we though it was fair to increase our speed to 45 (although we were doing 48). I am not arguing against the officer, but sitting where he was just before the sign seems like a jerk move. \n\nAnyways, I asked my friend what the officer got him with and he replied “for having fun in a no fun zone.” I am tempted to answer future officers with that reply.",

That said, let’s weigh out the probabilities here.  \n\nProbability of legitimately beating a traffic ticket on the evidence? Generally pretty low (absent the whole “cop doesn’t show up to court” scenario, which is unaffected by whether you made statements to the officer).  You sometimes get lucky on an out of date equipment calibration or typo on the citation, but most traffic court judges have already weighed credibility in favor of the officer before you show up that day.  \n\nProbability of catching a break if you just have a pleasant and direct interaction with the officer? Not guaranteed, but much higher.  My easiest traffic cases were those where I could call the officer and say “look, my client made a mistake, he was really respectful about the whole thing, and he has some serious consequences if he eats this citation. Can you cut him a break?”  Obviously it’s different if you have other exposure (e.g.- you may be over the limit or you’re carrying something you shouldn’t be), but sometimes it’s easier to try and catch a break than to get into a mind-battle with the police. \n\nDon’t take it as legal advice- just a practical thing to think about before getting too deep into asserting your rights in the middle of a traffic stop.",

He started by asking “do you have any *lawful* reason to be speeding?” Which is a trap anyway you look at it because there aren’t “lawful” reasons for speeding- like if I said my wife was in labor and I had to get to the hospital would it be lawful to speed? No, but they might cut me some slack. He wanted to see what excuse I spouted off. I ignored the question and asked if there was a problem and I flat out said in my nicest most polite customer service voice “sir, I’m asking if there’s a problem with my vehicle or registration today because I have passed many of you many times on my commute with my cruise set on 65mph and none of you have ever pulled me. So is there a problem today?” He broke into a little bit of an awkward chuckle and said no there wasn’t a problem. “Then why did you pull me today?” “Well to be honest I just lowered the threshold today” was his reply. He then asked if I had any warrants and if he could see my license & registration just to check. Sure fine. He does, comes back, tells me to remember 65mph is still speeding and lets me leave without a hassle. \nFun fact too- yes police can and will pull you over and can and will give you tickets for speeding even it’s under 10mph over the limit BUT, most sheriff and highway patrol agencies do not give a flying fuck if you’re going 5-10mph over unless you’re in a school zone or similar. \nMy BIL is a deputy and the sheriff flat out told patrol officers they better have a good fucking reason for pulling someone over if they weren’t going 10 over. If you’re going 15mph and up you’re a target for getting pulled over because that’s the amount over the speed limit that goes into misdemeanor reckless driving or speeding charges- in some states this means you can be arrested on the spot and have your car impounded. Small town cops will pull you over for almost anything if they can make revenue off the ticket for it, so bear that in mind. Some medium sized cities have a do not pursue policy if a car fails to stop for a traffic stop and flees- the departments have backed off that because the risk of serious damage, injury & death to innocent citizens is too high. But highway patrol, sheriff departments and wildlife law enforcement? They will chase you until your wheels fall off, out of the damn state sometimes, or until you’re dead.
