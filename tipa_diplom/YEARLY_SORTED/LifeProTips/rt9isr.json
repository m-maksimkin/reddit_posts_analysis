    "LPT Ubers are cheaper than DUIs, and funerals. Stay safe out there, happy New Year's.\nIf you plan to party, have a planned out ride or safe way to sleep it off.\n\nI'm no saint, I've spent more than a few evenings sleeping in my car to sober up.\n\nIf you plan to ever sleep in your car, have a blanket and a few insulating jackets handy. Also, a beanie is great to block out the light and some noise.\n\nWhen you wake up, drink water and get out of your car to walk around for a second to make sure your equilibrium has entirely returned. If it has, you can safely drive home.\n\n**Edit: I don't support Uber or Lyft explicitly, i just want a safer New Years.**\n\nMany are saying cabs can be cheaper on holidays, and considering these price surges from the ride sharing apps.. Uber and Lyft should instead be offering discounts, if anything, on nights like this.\n\nThat being said, please still tip well, it's your driver's holiday too.\n\nIt's also really endearing to hear about Coors' and AAA Insurance's free ride services for tonight. All these programs I'd be oblivious to without your comments. Thank you all, please take care.\n\n**Edit 2:** For all those saying this post is common sense, yes, \"don't drink and drive\" is common sense. Although not common enough imo.\n\nHowever, perciving the perspective that an even an $800 Lyft could cost less than a DUI, (I'm hoping) could possibly make at least one person think twice before deciding to write off the safer options of getting home tonight.": [

Family, relationship best friend had COVID. \nI relapse. I get borderline blackout.  I drive. Pulled over. DWI. \nI have to go back to work in a month. I have no choice. Need to take care of DWI ASAP. I cannot tell my job that I have court dates for DWI. I will lose job for sure. This is not to mention the shame and fear I felt for driving in the shape I was in. I am so, so, so glad I didn't hurt anyone. \nI go to jail for one night. I get convicted.\nAttorney is 8k, he gets fines down to 1500. License is suspended and now when I Renew my documents for the industry I work in I have to disclose the DWI which will ultimately end in my said documents/license being revoked permanently.\nThe governing body for my job does not play around with DUI/DWI or any other drug related offense. \n\nI fucked up. Could have hurt or killed someone and feel like a piece of moral. \n\nMoral of the story. Ubers/lyft/ cabs or whatever the fuck are way cheaper. Just leave your house in one of those initially and then once you're  out and about having your drinks then you don't have a choice but to take a ride back home. \n\nI know I have more than just that to fix. I need to work on getting sober, alcohol and I do not mix well. \n\nThis all happened in Oct. 21'. Fast forward to Dec 21'. I get a text message from a family member telling me that a cousin several times removed, younger than me, he was 24. Died in a vehicle accident on Dec 17th. Alcohol was suspected to be involved. Only 24. Just like that. \n\nWhether it's the money you have to spend or you losing your life being via death or prison. It. Is. Not. Worth. It. \nThe job? I mean what can I do? I'm just glad no one was killed but definitely could have not used a DWI. \nStay safe.",

That sucked, for many reasons, including the cost.\n\n6 years after getting a DUI, my wife and I were hit by a repeat DUI offender while riding our bikes. He hit her, kept going, hit me and kept going, pushing my bike under his Jeep for about 500‚Äô (I was thrown from the bike).\n\nI was relatively uninjured but have incredibly annoying tinnitus as a result.\n\nMy wife had a broken leg, collar bone, fractured cervical vertebrae and fractured ribs. She was in thr hospital for 2+ weeks, did rehab for 12 wks, had a rod put in her leg (and removed a year later), metal put in her shoulder (and removed, along with the end of the bone) and more. Her son was devastated to see her in the hospital (he was 11 at the time).\n\nIt‚Äôs been a number of years and it still affects us.\n\nWhere we live, convicted drunk drivers have to attend victim impact panels. I now know people whose children, husbands and wives have been killed by drunk drivers. I see more DUI people than you would believe on a regular basis, way more than we should ever see, and they are only a small fraction of the people who drive drunk.\n\nFor the folks who says ‚Äúthis is common sense‚Äù: no shit.
