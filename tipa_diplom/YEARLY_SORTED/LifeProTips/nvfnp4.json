    "LPT: When you don't have all the facts, try to give people the most generous reason you can for their behaviour. Annoyingly slow driver? Maybe it's a mom with a birthday cake in the back. This mindset will gradually make you less reactive, more compassionate and more forgiving of your own bad days.\nEdit: thank you for all sharing your tips (didn't realise \"they must need to poop\" was such a common assumption!), awards and stories of how you do this in your own life. You're all fucking awesome, have a beautiful day and take all these good vibes out with you into the real world and spread them around! üåª": [

Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he‚Äôs trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he‚Äôs in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way.\n\nOr I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket‚Äôs checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.\n\nAgain, please don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm giving you moral advice, or that I‚Äôm saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it. Because it‚Äôs hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you won‚Äôt be able to do it, or you just flat out won‚Äôt want to.\n\nBut most days, if you‚Äôre aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line.

Or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but it‚Äôs also not impossible. It just depends what you want to consider. If you‚Äôre automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won‚Äôt consider possibilities that aren‚Äôt annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.\n\nNot that that mystical stuff is necessarily true.

On my way out, I heard our nurse asking if the oncologist could be called in from vacation to see her the next morning (it turned out ok, but I couldn‚Äôt know that at the time!)\n\nI shouldn‚Äôt have been driving of course, but no one was thinking straight at the time. I remember drifting between lanes and not realizing my lights weren‚Äôt on until I was almost home, god knows what other awful things I did on the road.\n\nFrom that point on, I almost never get road rage. Because whether it‚Äôs something crazy or food poisoning or a hot tinder meet-up‚Ä¶it could be anything. Assume it‚Äôs something incredibly important and go on your way.\n\nFYI, I left my wife at the hospital that night with her mother, because we needed stuff from home for a long hospital visit and everyone agreed I needed a shower, badly. And everything turned out ok! The baby was fine and is now a healthy 9-year old, with two younger siblings. It wasn‚Äôt brain cancer of course (another neurological condition which sucks but not life-threatening).\n\n\n\nwith her mother, because someone needed to pick up supplies, and I desperately needed a shower and sleep.",

By assuming they did not have malicious intent towards you, you can become understanding, calm, and patient. This is a way to find peace in a world where others often intrude on us.\n\nThere is more to learn than just the TLDR from this and Chuang Tzu‚Äôs other amazing writings. This one writing has a few lessons buried in it for those that care to study it.\n\n>\tHe who rules men lives in confusion;\nHe who is ruled by men lives in sorrow.\nYao therefore desired\nNeither to influence others\nNor to be influenced by them.\nThe way to get clear of confusion\nAnd free of sorrow\nIs to live with Tao\nIn the land of the great Void.\n\n>\tIf a man is crossing a river\nAnd an empty boat collides with his own skiff,\nEven though he be a bad-tempered man\nHe will not become very angry.\nBut if he sees a man in the boat,\nHe will shout at him to steer clear.\nIf the shout is not heard, he will shout again,\nAnd yet again, and begin cursing.\nAnd all because there is somebody in the boat.\nYet if the boat were empty.\nHe would not be shouting, and not angry.\n\n>\tIf you can empty your own boat\nCrossing the river of the world,\nNo one will oppose you,\nNo one will seek to harm you.\n\n>\tThe straight tree is the first to be cut down,\nThe spring of clear water is the first to be drained dry.\nIf you wish to improve your wisdom\nAnd shame the ignorant,\nTo cultivate your character\nAnd outshine others;\nA light will shine around you\nAs if you had swallowed the sun and the moon:\nYou will not avoid calamity.\n\n>\tA wise man has said:\n‚ÄúHe who is content with himself\nHas done a worthless work.\nAchievement is the beginning of failure.\nFame is beginning of disgrace.‚Äù\n\n>\tWho can free himself from achievement\nAnd from fame, descend and be lost\nAmid the masses of men?\nHe will flow like Tao, unseen,\nHe will go about like Life itself\nWith no name and no home.\nSimple is he, without distinction.\nTo all appearances he is a fool.\nHis steps leave no trace. He has no power.\nHe achieves nothing, has no reputation.\nSince he judges no one\nNo one judges him.\nSuch is the perfect man:\nHis boat is empty.\n\n-Chuang Tzu\n\nLink with full text (as above): https://www.thedailyzen.org/2015/05/27/the-empty-boat-by-chuang-tzu/",

Tom Hanks on an island all alone has no need for morality. Only in a group of people does good or bad have a meaning. And in that group of people, a \"good\" or \"moral\" act is one with the highest possible outcome for all members of the group. \n\nEmpathy is when a person can accurately sense and understand what another person feels and therefore what would make them feel better. Or in other words, as empathy approaches infinity, so does the potential for virtue. Now it is important to remember that empathy cannot be infinite as our brains and bodies cannot possibly fathom the totality of what every one else thinks and feels. It is therefore important to always leave room for mistakes to be made, miscommunications to occur, and redemption to be had. However, even in the lack of the capacity for perfect empathy we can create algorithms to approximate it. \n\nAlways trying to imagine what others are going through, including this exercise where you try to think of any possible reasonable explanation for someone's insensitive behavior, brings you closer to the ideal of perfect empathy. Now, maybe that person is just a jerk. Sure. But assuming they are not and acting accordingly brings you no harm but only good. Giving others the benefit of the doubt raises the overall outcome of society and in turn benefits you personally as well. Win win!\n\nNow, don't be gauche and think you should blindly trust others to have your best interests at heart. You can be suspicious of others and protect yourself while also allowing for the possibility of their innocence, or rather their redeemability. \n\nI am not Christian but this is what Christ was on about with the forgiveness and the turning of the cheek and all that. It's not about objective morality where some Sky Lord judges you, but rather it is about relative morality where the best outcomes for all occur when we support and believe in each other, and allow each other to grow and heal. Striving for empathy is akin to achieving virtue which is a path wherein our best shot at a collective happiness resides.",

He was just past middle adult years, so around 6 or 7, and had been playing frisbee. After going one of the throws, he held his backleg all the way up as best he could. So I'm already upset, my buddy is hurt because I threw the frisbee.\n\nHe was very good as I sat down and tried to understand what hurt. Did he pull a muscle? Did he have a charlie horse? He only whined a little bit when people got home from work or school but he was in full vocal mode. His haunch seemed to be okay but I barely touched his knee when he cried. And it took a few seconds to stop crying.\n\nBy that point, I had him stay and I got my keys and a blanket and threw the blanket in my backseat so he could lie down more comfortably. My dog was 88lbs of pure lean muscle, fuzz, and good boi. He always had excellent results from checkups. I managed to pick him up and carry him to the backseat, then call the animal hospital to tell them I was on the way, and we hightailed it out of there.\n\nI'm already holding back tears because I was afraid it would be something serious enough that combined with his age, they'd recommend putting him to sleep. I've never NOT been there with my dogs during the procedure, even when I was fairly young. I don't want them to be afraid and wonder where I'm at. One of my greatest fears in life is one of my dogs wondering where I'm at while something horrible happens and they die, alone and afraid. If I end up a situation, I know why I'm in said situation. I swerved on a road to avoid something and hit a tree. I developed a fatal disease, etc. Obviously a dog can't do that and they count on us to make things better.  I don't cry at funerals as I've had time to grieve already, no one in my life has had a sudden end. If that were to happen, I probably would cry. Again, dogs can't understand and it hurts when they hurt and don't know why they hurt and why haven't I made the hurt go away like I've done before?\n\nSorry, off track. Short story long, dog deaths just wreck me on a entirely different level.\n\nSo I'm driving to the animal hospital, definitely speeding, but also very well aware that being reckless or getting pulled over would endanger others and make things worse for my buddy. I was just...urgent. All the roads to the animal hospital are one lane both ways and I'd have to cross at a minimum of four sets of railroad tracks. I didn't tailgate, or honk, or flash my lights, all I did was pass someone when the coast was clear.\n\nAnd two people, two very nice people somehow understood I really wanted to go around them. I wasn't being an asshole, I didn't tailgate, and I was hyperaware that getting pulled over or getting into a wreck would be extremely unhelpful. But the first person pulled off to the side, slowed down, and actually waved me forward. After I passed them and they were back on the road, I waved out my window in thanks.\n\nThe second person didn't wave but did let me pass and I waved in thanks. I don't know why someone built the animal hospital on the butt end of town but it was one of the longest routes from point A to B for me to drive. When we got there, it was hard getting him out the backseat but managed to get a hold of him and carry him up the steps. Some kind soul opened the door and we had made it.\n\nAs best I understood, one of the long, long tendons or ligaments in the leg had broken completely. The part it...anchored? or held was the long bone in the top part of their leg connected with the smaller leg bone at their kind of backwards knee thing? Whatever it was called, they were just freely moving when that leg moved, rubbing or clacking into each other, obviously causing pain.\n\nThe vet stablized the bones where they needed to be with wrapping the leg in the correct position, nice and secure. My buddy had surgery two days later and he stayed at the hospital those first two nights before surgery so they could make sure he didn't accidentally further injure himself.\n\nHe ended up having to need the surgery twice. The morning of his last post surgery check-up, the same exact injury happened again as he got out of the car. I will never understand how it happened as he got out of the back seat very gingerly, with me helping keep him steady. But it happened. I don't know if they used it during the first surgery but the second on for sure replaced that connective tissue with Teflon I think. And I got another half decade with my buddy.\n\nSo when someone is driving like a jerk, or that they get by me is of supreme importance, I very quickly remember how I felt that day and cut them a lot of mental slack and just do what I can to let them go by. Someone could be driving their buddy to an animal hospital. Or a person to a regular hospital (cause fuck paying 6k for calling 911). Or any myriad of other reasons. Maybe they just really have to go to the bathroom. Both days are made better by letting them go by.",

His friends get him in a car and try to rush him to the hospital. They‚Äôre somewhat speeding down the interstate, trying to be fast and cautious at the same time, when this one car decides to change lanes and block their car in the lane, deliberately slowing them down. They change lanes, the car changes too and keeps them blocked in. Now this guy is bleeding badly in the back seat while his friends are trying their damndest to stop it and honking at the car to move out of the way. This goes on for miles, gets the attention of a police cruiser and they eventually pass the car. When they finally arrived at the hospital, the guy was already out and unresponsive as hospital personnel rushed him to the ER. The driver blocking them turned out to be this lady who followed them and was complaining to the officer about how kids these days do what they want joyriding and speeding with reckless abandon blah blah blah. The doctors informed the guys their friend bled out and didn‚Äôt make it, and while the friend who told this story didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell the lady, the cop sure did and she went pale, like next fucking level dying inside kind of pale. \n\nI feel like I need to find this story, but the tl;dr is: Driver thought she could stop youngsters from ‚Äújoyriding‚Äù without knowing the facts and essentially killed a man because he didn‚Äôt make to the hospital in time.",

It wasn't even meowing, and that scared me. \n\nI was split between \"Gotta make it to the vet\" and \"Oh fuck is it still breathing\" and \"One hand to support it, one to drive - don't hold too tight or you'll hurt it.\" and \"oh god I hope it hasn't lost too much blood, I don't want it to die but there's so much blood on me right now\" \n\nGoing around that super-curvy road's turns while doing the speed limit needs both hands - I went slow because I needed to be able to turn one-handed and people behind me *did not like that*. A LOT of them were honking angrily, and one person tailgated me for a few minutes \n\nI also didn't want to be doing what I was doing! It was an awful experience! \n\nGood news? The kitten survived! His leg had to be amputated from the knee-down because several bones in his foot and ankle had fractures, but thankfully the blood loss was less severe than I thought.  The vet gave me a bit of a discount, and a couple friends helped pitch in to pay for the surgery and aftercare. \n\nLast update was that he had recovered, and was being moved to a shelter for adoption.   \n\\---\n\nSo... if anyone in Kentucky adopted a little white and orange kitten missing his hind left leg about 3 years back: I hope he's doing well!",

It's a wierd line to walk, in the sense that something that happens on your tome by yourself is whatever but when other people are watching it starts developing a stigma about the type of person you might be, also known as \" being the bigger man and walking away \" \n\nOne story that always stuck with me if I remember correctly was from Lao  Tzu's concept on the superior man. Say you meet someone at an event and have to ask them their name and they somewhat with  haughtiness tell you it.  only to further get upset when they realize you don't know who they are. \n\nNow you could believe this person to be vain, or stuck up and disregard it as someone who is self absorbed or full of themselves and become mad yourself for their arrogance,  or you could instead react like the superior man and take a step back to try and understand why in fact you didn't know this person on sight or when you heard their name. Was it a lack of knowledge,  laziness to not care or be perceptive enough of your surroundings. Did you overlook something about this specific situation an important figure attending it or a relative of the host. Was this person involved in political happenings.  \n\nI know it sounds a bit like rubbish but really the key point here is, why allow yourself to be ruled by spontaneous emotions, question the authenticity of your awareness and consider you lacked knowledge that was either readily available or expected. I'm sure as well as simply conduct yourself always in a manner that can best diffuse altercations. \n\nInteresting none the less.",
