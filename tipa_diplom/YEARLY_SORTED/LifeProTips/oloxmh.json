Is there other sensations or emotions added to the mixture?\n\nThe idea is that the feeling of anger really doesn't have any power once you stop cycling through the thoughts that are causing the anger. It feels pretty much the same as being restless, or anxious, or even excited/euphoric. Its not inherently bad on its own. If you're focusing on that and not the cause of the anger, it just doesn't stick around. It goes away remarkably quickly.

If you use that negative energy in the presence of someone you're angry at, it becomes pretty obvious pretty fast that you're doing it because you're angry and then there's an association created between \"doing chores\" and \"being angry\", and then you have a whole new set of problems to deal with.\n\nIf you really need to unleash anger in a physical way, just get something you can beat up harmlessly. It doesn't have to be expensive like one of those torso training dummies, just beat the shit out of a cheap mattress in private if you have to.\n\nBetter yet, when you feel angry, learn how to express that in words to the person you're angry at.\n\nYou have value, so if you feel you've been wronged by somebody, teach yourself to be confident in expressing your point of view when you've been wronged. If you can't express yourself without resorting to yelling, insults, or violence, consider why that's the case. Is it because you're wrong and you need to admit YOU are the one that fucked up? Is it because the person you're angry with doesn't value your opinion and maybe you need to consider your relationship with them?\n\nVenting frustration externally is okay sometimes, but don't learn to rely on it. Sometimes you just need to confront your problems and solve them directly.",

I‚Äôll pick it up soon‚Äù. Whereas microdosed brain thinks ‚ÄúPick it up now. You‚Äôre being ridiculous. Pick it up **now**‚Äù\n\nSorry for the tangent but yeah, if I feel misery but have been exercising and going to therapy and all that jazz (and microdosing, which I couldn‚Äôt do for a while when trying a different treatment, and the day after I tried it again, I felt like **trying again**), I use the inescapable feeling to handle tasks that I don‚Äôt care all that much about (which encompasses pretty much all tasks outside of caring for my dog, eating, and bathing), but which some part of my brain (that I‚Äôve always found difficult to tap into) still apparently recognizes as important. It doesn‚Äôt make me happy. And when I‚Äôm eating the .25 grams, roughly, I know it won‚Äôt make me happy, but experience has taught me that as long as I‚Äôm experiencing the subtle effects, one effect is helping me recognize the reality that being happy isn‚Äôt necessarily a helpful goal at that time.
