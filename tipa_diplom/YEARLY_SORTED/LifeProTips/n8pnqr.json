My phone was on my bike's handlebars as I was using it for navigation.

It will help you learn how to stop giving a damn what other people think of you, and it will teach you how be comfortable being alone with your own thoughts. There‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôve learned in personal development more valuable than this.\n\n**EDIT:** Since this picked up a lot of commentary I figured I'd drop some answers to the most frequent replies here.\n\n1. **What if I CAN do these things, but I just don't enjoy doing them alone?A.** Not a problem! You've already got the skill. The important thing is being ABLE to do these things.  We shouldn't tie our own happiness and contentment to any other individual. It's important for us to be able to function and enjoy ourselves when we're alone.  There is, however, nothing wrong with being ABLE to do this but not enjoying doing so.  If you prefer time spent with other people that's just fine!\n2. **I don't really like eating alone, and I don't really go to movies either way. What else is there?A.** Amusement parks!  If you go to an amusement park on your own it's ALL about you and your fun. You ride only the rides YOU want to ride. You stay as long as YOU want to stay. Since many rides often have an available seat left over you'll frequently be given a chance to bypass the line because the ride operators are trying to fill a car to capacity before sending it off. Museums and Zoos are also incredible places to go by yourself. You get to see only the exhibits you're interested in and you can spend as much or as little time at each exhibit as you like. Again, it's also nice to be able to stay as long as you want without having to worry about friends getting tired or having other engagements they need to get to that make you have to cut short your plans before you do everything you would have liked to do.\n3. **I've been in a longterm relationship and am having trouble figuring out how to function on my own again//I've moved to a new town and don't know anyone here, so I'm trying to do things by myself.A.** Flying solo isn't always the answer. If you've recently been cutoff from your usual social circle it's wise to take steps to build a new one. Try volunteer work, or sign up for dancing or cooking classes, join a yoga or exercise class, or sign up for the local amateur sports or theater group.  Get yourself out there in the world where you can meet new people and experience new things!",

I researched it, realized plane tickets were 50% lower than normal, I got a hotel for 50% off (friends and family at the Hilton Grand Naniloa), and got a rental for thirty bucks a day thanks to Costco. I brought all the non perishable snacks I would need for day trips in my luggage, drank free Kona coffee at the hotel, and only bought dinner at the hotel on a discount every night. I even brought a small filter pitcher and tons of canteens so I wouldn‚Äôt have to buy bottled water. \nI covered 900 miles in five days, hiked just about every major landmark/park that was open to the public, and never once stepped foot into a tourist trap (except to go the bathroom at an outdoor mall in Kona).

My bud invited them to come bike with us, as we were not going fast. She invited 2 friends, and after that the group exploded from 2 to 6 people. Since then, the group was always about 3-4, and with some days up to as many as 8.\n\nI have since left that town, but I know the core group still gets together for biking and drinks afterwards. It took months to get one person to go with me, and more months to continue to grow it. I would have never successfully started this group if I didn't have the courage to go and do it by myself for weeks before. Yeah, it was lonely at first. And then, once I got over that and started pushing myself and exploring new places, the word spread and the people came. \n\nBeing alone, confidently, without being lonely, is a hard skill to master, but so worth it.",

            "text": "Did this Oct/Nov 2019. Was living in France for a short period and always wanted to do a UK trip off season during a study break. Looked for people in class to go with but no one took. I‚Äôve done short solo trips before but I had never booked a detailed trip. I remembered how awesome my trip to Hawaii was which was planned by my friend. My budget was tight, but I had 14 days to kill so here goes:\n\nFew things I learned when booking a solo trip: \n\n1) Prioritise what you want done and have some activities/places as backups that you could use to fill in some time gaps and spread them throughout the trip to not tightly book your schedule. Overbooked a day and missed a train. It also leaves you breathing room to be flexible in case the weather changes, your mood changes, or you‚Äôre just tired and need a break.\n\n2) Stay at hostels for 2 reasons: a) saves a lot of money to spend on experiences instead and b) you get to meet people who are also on their own voyage. Do your research though - super important.\n\na)I kid you not, I think my overall lodging cost was ‚Ç¨350 for 2 weeks; expensive in magnitude but divi it by day and that‚Äôs about avg ‚Ç¨25/day. It also helped for a budget-friendly gastronomic experience. (Though I was not in the UK for a food experience lol)\n\nb) You can discuss your ideas, events or just have a drink and socialize (always protect your drinks!). Happened to be in Edinburgh on Halloween and hot damn the number of awesome activities available was WILD! Was planning to do the Halloween bar hop but was tired from a day trip to the Highlands so did a tour of a part of town that was built over by the Chamber of Commerce and had been subjected to multiple plagues. Yes this part of the city was under a building! Great Halloween experience lol\n\n3) if you do happen to miss something, don‚Äôt feel too bad about it and take it in stride because maybe it happened for a reason: woke up late and missed my trip to Stonehenge on day 3/14. Happened to leave a day to chill in London on the last day and the company had an opening on that day and allowed me to move my trip! Good thing that happened because I went to Stonehenge and Bath on a fantastically sunny day. My pics are AMAZING!\n\n4) Pack light and get a good back pack. Also pack a smaller back pack for the smaller day trips if needed. It was great to not lug a suitcase around, especially without a car.\n\nNow I know what I would revisit and spend more time on (a camping trip in Inverness, a day at the spa in Bath, hop over to Ireland since I missed it due to lack of time vs places to see!). Unfortunately that trip was near the end of my time in France, but now I know where I can‚Äôt focus more time and money for the next time!\n\nSolo travels are a great way to have fun on your own time at your own pace without someone pushing you or waiting for someone. It helped me build confidence, how to not be too hard on myself if something didn‚Äôt work out and also how to be more thrifty than I was at the time. I was lucky that everyone I spoke to was genuinely friendly so it made for an unforgettable trip (France is not as friendly, and I speak French!)\n\nI‚Äôll admit though, that trip was a one off: BoJo had just been elected so the pound dropped to about the value of about a Euro so this Canadian jumped on it. Don‚Äôt know if I could ever do that kind of trip again at a similar budget.\n\nHave fun and be safe!\n\nEdit: I wrote about this trip because I was not a major traveller though I enjoyed travelling, mostly because if I waited for someone to go with, they usually had 1) already been there or 2) didn‚Äôt want to go. I was fed up of waiting so this was my first planned trip. I‚Äôve always gone to movies, concerts, unplanned drives solo. I learned long ago to not wait for people, because time will move on without you!",

I never learned how to enjoy my own company or be content alone. If it was a nice day out and I wanted to grab a coffee and take my dog to the park, it was like I couldn‚Äôt do that unless BF came with, but he didn‚Äôt like the park so we just stayed home. There were so many small things that I never did alone until I was single, and I never really appreciated those things until I did them alone. \n\nI love taking my dog for walks. I love getting a coffee and sitting outside. I love taking my laptop to a coffee shop. Even going for food or picking a movie to watch. If the person you‚Äôre with doesn‚Äôt feel like doing it, just do what you want by yourself and enjoy it. \n\nDisclaimer: please note that there should be a fine balance in a relationship. You shouldn‚Äôt feel like you can‚Äôt do anything without your partner, but if you aren‚Äôt doing anything at all WITH your partner, that doesn‚Äôt sound healthy either. You should have some individual interests and some shared interests. If there are things that are really important to you to do together as a couple (eg, I think that having my partner at family holidays is important), then make sure you‚Äôre on the same page about those expectations, because what might seem obvious to you, may not to others. I had a friend who was seeing a girl that was shocked and insulted that my friend didn‚Äôt text her while he was working. She was so hurt and angry at him about it, because it was an expectation she had that a boyfriend who cared would want to text all day. He hates texting, and would rather talk in person when they see each other. Their expectations didn‚Äôt align and it didn‚Äôt work out.",

I actually quickly began to prefer it and would choose not to invite my friends along. \n\nThe initial reason for this was I had moved to a city that was an hour or longer away from all my friends, and I had a hard time making new friends while living there. I had just turned 21 at the time, and I was very interested in going out every single weekend. Usually, if I couldn‚Äôt find a friend to join me in going out, I just wouldn‚Äôt, but I quickly grew tired of this and eventually said, fuck it, I‚Äôll just go by myself. \n\nIt turns out that it was one of the best decisions I ever made. No one was going to screw the night up by being in a bad mood, getting too drunk, getting into a fight, not want to go to certain places, need to be home early, etc. I was a completely free agent and whatever I chose to do was what I did, no ‚Äòif‚Äôs ands or buts.‚Äô \n\nThis created a whole collection of random and crazy events that would transpire while I was out on the town, and eventually led to me taking a trip out to LA by myself. It was my first time on a plane, too. I was pretty nervous, but it can be really exciting and rewarding to push yourself out of your comfort zone, especially when you are by yourself.\n\nTake a ride on the wild side, guys. üòé\n\nTLDR: I started going out to bars by myself and it was one of the most rewarding decisions of my life.",

After I had decided to actually go, I opened up the invite to any of my friends months ahead of time to see who would want to go and got a few people who were interested. \n\nEventually though, everyone had backed out mostly due to financial situations. I still really wanted to go so I changed my plans up and made it so that I would go alone for a week. (As a sidenote, I understood that it wasn‚Äôt going to be a cheap trip and I made it clear to my friends ahead of time but between airfare from the east coast, accommodations, food, spending money, and experiences, etc., I was able to get the price of the trip down to about ~$650-$700 dollars for one week after a ton of research into budget-friendly methods of traveling.) What ended up happening was I went on the greatest solo trip of my life. \n\nSome notable stories from the trip that I have include meeting 3 guys sitting next to me who went to college in my city at a genuine yakitori place in the Omoide Yokocho neighborhood and taking sake shots with them/telling stories to each other. \n\nAnother fun story from the trip was while I was at one of the two Disney parks, I was standing in line waiting to go on a Finding Nemo-esque ride while it started to rain. I, always trying to be prepared for any situation, came ready with an umbrella. There were two Japanese girls that I later learned were my age in front of me who were getting absolutely soaked so I held my umbrella out above them. This started a conversation between the 3 of us while we waited to hop on the ride. Well lo and behold, they were both studying English at the university of Tokyo so I got to talk with them and we ended up bonding over similar music tastes. It‚Äôs been 3 years now since I‚Äôve gone and we still keep in touch. (I‚Äôll be planning on going back to see them after covid is over!)\n\nIf anyone ends up reading this and is thinking of traveling alone somewhere, even a little bit, just do it. Save your money up, research budget traveling, stay in a cheap 700¬• per night hostel like I did. It‚Äôs going to be the greatest experience of your young life. I‚Äôm now 22 and nothing I‚Äôve done in my life before or since then has ever been as comparable. I would do it again in a heartbeat. I hope this response inspires some people to take the leap of faith and try a solo trip like this. You won‚Äôt regret it",

Another big example is if he's hungry. He will ask me if I am hungry, usually I say no because I only eat like once, maybe twice a day. He gets kinda mad and pouty, and I tell him to stop and get something, but he doesn't want to unless I eat too. If you are hungry, eat! Don't wait for me.

Trust me you will thank yourself later its truly a humbling  experience  to do the things you enjoy alone and just basc  in that moment. I swim 6 times a week plus cycle, I cook when I want clean when I want play music when I want, it's truly epic.\n\n\nSource came out of a 9 year relationship brought my own home it's sooo nice knowing, where everything is enjoying my hobbies without feeling worried about another person's time. \n\nPlus no ones stronger than a person who don't need anyone else to motivate  them other than themselfs.",

The show had already started and there was a scalper left, no one else around looking for tickets. Told me it was a front row seat. I was skeptical but he took my offer of $55. Sure enough it was front row and I had the best time ever!",
