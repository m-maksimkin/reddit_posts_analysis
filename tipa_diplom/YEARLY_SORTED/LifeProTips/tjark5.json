In your recording software, you can set it up so that you just place your cursor before where you messed up, hit a key, and a custom macro will cut at cursor, delete after cursor, and 'pre roll' or give you the last few seconds of 'good' audio to cue you in.\n\nPro tip on that, the best place to join up takes is on plosives like p, b, t, k, not spaces between words or even sentences a lot of the time. Spaces are fine, but it takes practice before you can make the sentences or phrases run on believably over multiple takes. Using punch and roll, you can speak over your cue to get the tone and speed just right, and 9 times out of 10 the join with the hard consonant is inaudible. For example in the phrase 'practice t/alking every day'.",

Another thing to add to the clapperboard conversation.. theres also 'soft sticks' where the clapper board is near a subjects face and it'll be too loud to clap there.
