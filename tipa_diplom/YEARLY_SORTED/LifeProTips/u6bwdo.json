    "LPT If you're planning on visiting San Francisco please for the love of God do not leave ANYTHING of even a vague resemblance of value in your car, or your windows will get smashed and you'll lose it.\nI'm not talking about a laptop or a purse. I'm talking about a hoodie, a blanket, a travel mug, a USB cable, or heaven forbid a few coins in plain sight. Hell, even kids toys aren't safe.\n\nTinted windows are practically a guarantee your windows will get smashed. The biggest pain in the ass is getting the windows replaced, not necessarily whatever gets stolen.\n\nBuddy of mine who used to live in lower Haight got his car windows smashed so often he decided to just leave them down one night. He woke up to find THREE homeless people sleeping in his car.": [

They don't know where footage is going to. One of my camera actually has wifi so I can activate it in my house and look through camera in real time, and save footage.\n\nAfter my car was broke into I put my first dash cam in. 2 years later some lady also hit my car and lied to insurance and police, saying she had green light. I handed over the footage to insurance and they cut me a check within 2 days and thanked me for making thier jobs much easier. You cant trust anyone anymore for anything. Better to have hard proof and film as much as you can when in your car and also at home.\n\nMe putting up cameras in my vehicle, in my apartment, and outside my apartment  has literally gave me such a peace of mind and also has almost eliminated people tailing me or driving aggressive around me, or stealing my packages.

I could see a bit of the ocean from my top floor flat and spent many days at Baker Beach watching the dolphins play.   Amazing beauty!\n\nI loved most everything about my experience there but hardly ever went to tourists spots and never went downtown the last 15 years I was there.    I was fortunate to have a two car garage but parking while out in the city is always a hassle.  Luckily, I never had my car broken into. \n\nI moved because the owner of the house I rented did an Ellis Act eviction and I couldn‚Äôt afford to continue my lifestyle there.  I rented a house with two flats, two car garage and big backyard for SF.   I ran my business out of the bottom floor flat.  Because of rent control I only paid $4000 a month total for flats that would easily go for $8000 each a month now.  \n\nIf you can afford it, I think SF is still a great place to live.

Cars are less likely to be broken into if they're parked in an area with a lot of consistent street traffic \n* Out of state plates and rental cars are an especially juicy target because tourists tend to keep their luggage in the car \n* Items like suitcases, charge cables, battery banks, etc. are useful to the under-sheltered and therefore a target",

We were walking around, went into a small shop, and were chatting with the worker.  As soon as he found out we were from out of town, he gave us this exact same advice.  I sprint/walked back to the car right then, and LUCKILY nothing had happened yet.  We were gone from the car about 10 minutes.  On my wife's way back to the car behind me (because she was walking at a normal pace) she saw a car parked with the window busted out and multiple homeless folks going through some victim's suitcase on the sidewalk.  On the trip, we saw tons of cars with windows busted out.  We took the advice of not leaving ANYTHING in the car, and we didn't have any problem.  To be honest, that was a little annoying, but the trip overall was really great.  We never felt unsafe at all.  It seems like the crime was more related to homeless people stealing crap, versus people trying to mug you/hurt you.  We enjoyed the city and would still go back.  So yes, to echo some people here, there is crime, homelessness, dirty, dirty things....but overall, lovely city :)  At least for the few days we were there.",

Nothing bad happened to my car.\n\nThat said, my coworker was there more recently (5-4 years ago) and got his [rental] car window smashed and his expensive MacBook Pro stolen.  Never recovered the laptop.  He street parked.  I don‚Äôt even think he was gone for that long. I think he just went to grab a bite to eat and by the time he was back the window had been smashed.  He said he‚Äôs never going back to San Francisco again.\n\nSF has highly organized street gangs who do these smash and grab operations.  I would bet that it‚Äôs probably around 15 to 30 people tops that are doing all the smash and grabs.  They exclusively target tourists and rental cars.  Always street parked.  They also case the car and do their homework extensively.  I have never heard of a San Francisco native / resident getting targeted.  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they have a DMV informant who looks up the license plates of the cars they are intending to smash and grab.\n\nContrary to popular belief, it is not homeless people or junkies who are doing this.\n\nIMHO, I‚Äôve only been to SF as a tourist but I would never ever leave my car parked out in the street there.  Even for 15 min.  Always shell out the extra money for a hotel lot with cameras and a parking attendant.  \n\nTake an Uber or Lyft when you need to get around SF.  It‚Äôs too much hassle to get your car out of the parking lot and find parking wherever you‚Äôre going in the city.  There is no parking wherever you‚Äôre going in SF.  Also those hills are pretty bad on your car as far as wear and tear.  So Uber or Lyft.\n\nConsidering the high SF real estate values and the fact that residents aren‚Äôt getting targeted, it seems that the city government is somehow complicit in these crimes.  They seem to not give a shit about funding street surveillance to stop car thefts.  \n\nIt could be that somebody in LE or city leadership is getting paid off to let the crime continue and not prosecute or gather evidence.  It is conjecture.  \n\nMy anecdotal experience tells me that it‚Äôs 99 out of 100 tourist cars and the police / government turn a blind eye to this frequent crime.\n\nThe car thefts really are a deterrent for repeat visits and tourism.  Too bad because San Francisco is such a beautiful city.",

Third time, they broke into our Tesla (yes, with all the security cameras) and stole our $30 emergency kit from the frunk, and a pair of prescription sunglasses that‚Äôll be useless on anyone else. \n\nIf you have a garage door opener hidden in the car, they will take it and use the address on your car registration to break into your home. \n\nThey use devices that search for wifi and bluetooth signals, so if you have anything like an iPad or a laptop in your car, your car will be broken into. If it‚Äôs in your backpack, they know. Turn everything off when you‚Äôre carrying it. \n\nI know of photographers and ebike riders being brazenly robbed at gunpoint in daylight in crowded areas on a daily basis. If you have a valuable device like a camera, you need to understand you have a giant target on your back. \n\nIn SF, the contents of a parked car are basically public property. These thieves are VERY organized, quick, efficient, do not care if they are being watched or recorded, and there is little you can do to prevent them besides not bringing anything valuable and hoping they don‚Äôt try anyway. They are usually armed, so fighting back is not a good option. \n\nPolice will typically do nothing, even if you have a tracking device and know the stolen item‚Äôs location.

I was tired and didn't feel like walking back from the garage, so I took a spot directly in front of the hotel. My wife left her secondary purse with make-up and other non-essential stuff on the passenger floor board. I woke up around 4am and I could here a car alarm going off, but couldn't tell if it was mine. I had to get dressed and put on my contacts, but once I got outside, it was surely enough my truck. None of the other vehicles had been touched and I didn't know about the purse until I told my wife about the break-in. She had a mix of expensive and inexpensive makeup (as well as several gift cards she had recently gotten for her birthday) in the purse. She decided not to take it into the room with her because she didn't expect to do her makeup in the morning. They also got my camera bag with a Sony A6000 and 2 lenses that I forgot was on the back floorboard. The back windows are tinted, so if it hadn't been for the purse in front, I think they would have skipped our truck. My wife had also left some gold jewelry (about $600 value) in the center console out of sight, but the found it while ransacking the truck.\n\nI did get lucky that they missed my debit card that I forgot to put back in my wallet and a few other random things of value. It was pretty much an opportunistic smash and grab.\n\nAuto insurance didn't cover the personal property and I was able to replace the passenger window for $80 myself (vs $500 insurance deductible). Home owners insurance deductible also would be more than the value of the stuff taken minus the gold jewelry. The jewelry isn't covered unless you have declared it on your policy before the loss.",

But it's from a mathematical/chance perspective; I'm not trying to look like some risk taking badass (dumbass). I just tell people that depending where you live, it's overkill to lock everything up all the time. You don't need to roll your windows up, lock your car, and take your keys with you, to go into a damn 711. Where do you live that people just jack cars left and right like that? Or even quickly reach in your car and grab something?\n\nAnd no need to say \"Uhhh dude you've obviously never been to \\_\\_\\_\\_\", because I live 30 miles from one of the most crime ridden places in the country. Where I most definitely wouldn't leave my car running or unlocked. But I'm talking about the vast majority of Americans who act like their shit is gonna be stolen if they don't lock it up. Like you live in the suburbs, why are you chaining your lawnmower to your shed and shit? Oh better not leave the car in the driveway overnight, someone might break into it. Etc. People get crazy paranoid and they usually have little to no reason to. And it's often over something that they can claim on insurance or isn't even worth much.\n\n1000s of lockings and unlockings. Those times you lock your door, start walking away, but realize you forgot something. And oh shit I forgot my key in the house, did I hide one outside somewhere? Etc.\n\nLike would you not trade all that in for like a 5% chance you get robbed *once* in your life? I gladly make that trade on the daily. Especially with my car, if it took a physical key.\n\nWhich I realize a big part of the problem is we still use physical keys. (I would totally leave my car unlocked everywhere I go, but it's just a button press.) Which honestly surprises me. I would think by now everything would be keyless/electronic like with cars. At the very least, why don't people have electrical combination locks like at workplaces?\n\nIt's risk assessment. I hate the phrase \"better off safe than sorry\", as it usually only refers to the consequences of the sorry, and ignores the effort/cost of the safe.

Neither have ever been pulled over by cops nor have I ever been written up for tinting. I do believe in tinting to avoid a \"fishbowl look\" but not to the point where I'm some obnoxious 5% limo tint looking douchebag. I want pedestrians to see me that I'm making eye contact with them.\n\nWith that said my car hasn't been simply smashed for having a tint in San Francisco. I have, however, gotten my vehicle smashed in San Jose using the typical rear quarter panel smash which doesn't trigger alarms then getting my rear seats pulled down to see what's in the trunk. Nothing was there, but had I had a bag or valuables in the back they probably would then smash the main windows to get that bag out. That same night 5 other vehicles, some tinted, some non tinted also had their windows smashed. Mostly I noticed they were going for cars with easy rear seat releases rather than tinted cars.\n\nTint if you want, but it probably has a small or negligible effect on smash rates. Also with enough rear tint, even 30-40%, you can definitely get away with some small item on the floor without easily being seen--not that I would recommend it, but it's definitely helps makes stuff less visible.\n\nAlso tourist license plates (out of state) or rental looking cars I've heard of having high smash rates, but hey.. 2 weeks ago I took my in laws out on a rental car (FL license plates). Boy I was worried about having our windows broken into, but thank goodness nothing. I was really upset with myself for not picking the car with CA plates (I picked the car with lower mileage on the lot), but thankfully it didn't matter.",

I think I would have rather them lied to me that they didn't see anything.

Y‚Äôall somebody stole my fucking 17 year old cat. It was 2p, broad daylight, in a very commercial place with people everywhere. They drove up, got out, broke the window, yanked him out, and drove off. All in a matter of seconds.\n\nListen to OP y‚Äôall.\n\nI got him back, thankfully. After losing my ever loving mind, I mean a totally fucked in the head moment, some angel dude drove up and asked if I had lost a cat. Apparently Moo, my cat, was dumped on the sidewalk a block away. The guy watched the carrier for a minute expecting somebody to pick him up or something and after some time passed he decided to check it out. A moment later he saw me in the passenger seat, of a car with the window smashed in, looking crazy as hell and he put 2 and 2 together. Dude drove around for a while to try to find me again. He was about to give up and take my cat to a shelter when he spotted me. So in the span of 45 minutes I witnessed both a horrendously cruel and a beautifully empathic side of humanity. \n\nI‚Äôm from SF.

Don't put anything of value inside your car and don't lock your doors unless you have something that is more valuable than your deductible inside. If this is the case, place it in your trunk. Never have anything of value showing, or anything that something of value could be hiding under (blanket/jacket). When OP says that a hoodie or blanket can cause someone to smash your window, it's because most people think they're being clever hiding valuables underneath those things. If your doors are locked, they can't toss it aside to look. Spend a few extra seconds and put whatever it is you can't take with you in the trunk or glove box. If you have a valet key and can lock your trunk while leaving your cab open, even better.\n\nI know it sounds counter intuitive, but think about that deductible. The window is the most expensive thing you're going to lose, the thing they don't care about, and the first thing they will break to get less valuable things. Imagine that your window is a PS5 that can't be stolen, and you're saying \"you have to go through this if you want to get to my Friends season 3 box set.\" Whatever you have, it's probably not worth it.\n\nAlso don't waste any money on a car alarm. No one has ever heard one and thought \"oh shit someone is breaking into a car, I better go check it out.\" They think \"turn off your car alarm jackass.\" or \"oh shit, that sounds like my car alarm, I hope someone didn't run into me.\" I broke into cars for 7 years (legally, I was an automotive locksmith). I've looked shady as all hell with an alarm going off for ages while I jimmied a door (without my vehicle in site or a uniform), and never once had a person look my way or say anything.

I had the presence of mind to almost immediately look at and memorize the license plate of their car after I heard the glass shatter and kept repeating it to myself until someone could jot it down (though my mom has a habit of accidentally gaslighting me so I ended up being uncertain of 2 characters, I swear I would doubt my own name if she asked me \"if I was sure\" about it).\n\nThe worst part was that backpack had her stuffed animal and as far as I'm aware the police didn't even bother to check the plate we gave them, someone found her backpack empty on the side of the road (no stuffed animal) and gave it to the police. It seemed like this was so common that the police didn't want to waste manpower on it unless the car thief was literally present at the scene, ID'ed when they got there, or something of extreme value was taken like the car itself.\n\nSo you could literally have the license plates of the people who stole from you and the police still won't do anything about it.",
