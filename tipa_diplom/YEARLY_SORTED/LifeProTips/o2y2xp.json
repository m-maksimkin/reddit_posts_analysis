This is literally to accommodate for those working full time jobs. I even said to the agency I will even USE ANNUAL LEAVE for my training dates.

And blowing up and quitting on the spot because of one additional question of \"why?\" has the potential of burning a lot of bridges. It will definitely burn a reference bridge and if any of your coworkers were potential references, sticking them with extra work isn't likely to work in your favor.\n\nI know a lot of people like to say that a company won't give a reference and they're only half correct. HR is very unlikely to shit talk you during that phone call and that's good, hearsay is bullshit and has no room in a professional setting. A lot of places still call to confirm that you worked where you claimed you did, when you did, and job title and may phone some references on resumes that look promising. You would be surprised how many people embellish resumes, straight up lie, and don't ask people to be their reference, because they assume no one checks anymore because of lawsuits. But many still do. I wouldn't say the majority or even half, but that still leaves a sizable number that do.\n\nIt doesn't even take much effort on the company's part. If one company is very interested in someone, they will do a little extra due diligence, even if only to cover their own ass. It's shitty, unetheical, and maybe illegal, but the two HR people can just talk when not on company property, hours, or representing them in anyway. And all it takes is one extra phonecall. \n\nSo then you don't hear back from the company you applied for. Happens to everyone all the time. Not unusual. You call the company to check on your status. They can say they're still in the hiring process. Or they can say the position has been filled. And you either accept that and move on, or if you think your company gave a bad reference, you can sue. And you are guarenteed the right to have your suit examined by the appropriate court. But they're really busy already, and if you have nothing compelling beyond \"I think they lied to the people I applied too\", that's not going to get you far.\n\nThe reality of it sucks. Your previous employer can absolutely screw you with a reference, mostly likely informal and off the clock, and you'd have no proof. Even being a protected class does fuck all for real protection. They can build a paper trail of anything they like and use that as an excuse instead.\n\nI'm giving the \"I'd quit on the spot\" or \" I have quit on the spot\" people the benefit of the doubt and say they're not actually telling the truth and are pretending to have lived a power fantasy many, many people have imagined doing. Because smart people don't quit on the spot, on impulse, because a manager asked \"why?\". Average intelligence people don't either. Even the low end of average hold off until they have something else lined up.\n\nJust...be firm and don't be an asshole about these situations. Don't lick corporate boot to try and win some favor, but don't be an asshole when situations like this arise. You can say no in a polite way, you can continue to be firm while remainly cordial or at least neutral. But things don't always happen the way many on reddit believe they will or should. You can be retaliated against for accepting the extra hours in several different ways ranging from making you miserable until you quit all the way to firing you. And can explain it away as any other reason. So please bear that in mind when making your decisions and choose your words carefully.",

This is comprised of the owner , a workshop manager , myself and two other supervisors and finally the 10 employees that we manage that do various roles. Of these 10 , 4 are amazingly good , hard workers and the rest are horribly lazy and incompetent. \nIn our management circle , we get along well , so everything is discussed honestly and nothing hidden from us. So whenever we have to do overtime of any kind , I’m almost certainly guaranteed to be asked to get the good employees in and not even bother with the rest. From a management point of view , it makes perfect sense - why pay time and a half to those who probably won’t even turn up and let you down , when you can just ask the ones you know will turn up and get the job done. \nBut , at the same time , before I was promoted, I was one of those hard workers who was always asked to work overtime when others weren’t and I hated that. I also was the one who always said yes , and changed plans regularly to do so , because I felt that I had earned a reputation and respect from my bosses that would be damaged if I said no…. It sucked and I hated it. \nOn the one hand , it messed my life about on an almost weekly basis , but on the other , it was the reason I got a promotion to supervisor , with a huge jump in pay , benefits and a yearly bonus. \nI’m not contesting this post in any way , and to an extent I agree with the saying “I can’t” because it is an unfair position to be bullied into. I just wanted to offer my views , from someone who has been in both the asking and asked position over the past 10 years. \nI think it will vary in so many ways depending on your company, relationship with your manager etc, so best to weigh that up and do what suits you personally. Don’t damage your reputation if you want to go places , but don’t damage your mental health either - find a balance that suits you best and keeps your goals in check. \nFor me now though , I have two 2yo twin girls so I’ve always got a valid excuse for not working overtime because quality family time is way more important and my bosses respect that when I have to say no.",

I used to always feel terrible about declining invitations to hang out or attend events or whatever, and so I would always feel inclined to give some long excuse why I couldn't go. Sometimes I just plain didn't want to go, so had to invent an excuse because I didn't want to say that.\n\nOne day one of my close friends called me out and said it was obvious I just didn't want to come, and I could just say that instead of making excuses. It was a little embarrassing at the time - but I'm incredibly grateful they did that. \n\nSince then I've just started saying \"No\" or \"Don't feel like it\", instead of coming up with excuses. It's so much easier, because if you give someone an excuse, that's something they can try to convince you out of, and when you have to come up with a second excuse, you just look like an ass who was being dishonest about why they declined your invitation. Better to just say you can't or don't want to, and if they ask for elaboration, if there is a reason, tell them, if it's just that you don't want to or are busy, you can say as much.
