    "LPT: Instead of buying a dog as a Christmas present, buy accessories such as a leash, collar, and bowl. Your child can open these and get excited on Christmas morning. Then, when things have settled down, you can take your child to the shelter to pick out a pet together.\nAnimal shelters fill up with unwanted \"presents\" in January. If you hold off just a little, you can be a part of the solution AND find a pet that jives with you and your family's personality.": [

Most young dogs in shelters 6-18 months old, are there because of a lack of training or behavior issues brought on by careless or inappropriate husbandry. Dogs literally in there due to not being potty trained, because they're insecure messes due to socialization issues (Covid puppies are filling shelters now) and many other things that get MAGNIFIED in shelter environments. \n\nDogs and puppies are cute but there are extremely real consequences to owning one. Dogs that get dumped back into the shelter system have a much smaller chance of making it out alive and if they do their potential has been permanently damaged and there is a high likelihood of lingering echoes of past issues.\n\nLastly, most shelter staff do not know very much about the dogs that are up for adoption. I hate to break it to you but a lot of the times descriptions are a misrepresentation of the dog that you're adopting, as well as downplaying known issues. Every animal in a shelter or rescue is a product, and it is in the best interest of the organization to move them sooner rather than later.

I don‚Äôt think the issue is the parents picking out an animal the kids don‚Äôt like, but rather people don‚Äôt realize that owning and taking care of a pet takes work and they get tired of it after a month. A pet is not a good gift idea, get a pet because you want a companion animal and are willing and ready to take care of it. And a child should never be held responsible for taking care of and training a dog, I know people get their kids a pet and say ‚Äúyou have to take care of it since you wanted it‚Äù and of course they don‚Äôt because they‚Äôre kids and they don‚Äôt know how to take care of themselves let alone an animal and then the animal suffers. Cats are easier pets but I still think it‚Äôs a bad gift idea.",
