    "LPT: \"Off-brand\" was a term created by branded companies to make their cheaper competitors look bad. Don't see cheaper alternatives as lower quality or knock-offs, see them as a competitor. Some often are better than the branded version but the marketing psychology stops you from seeing that.\n": [

Cheaper products undercutting a \"name brand\" never come without some form of compromise to achieve that savings.\n\nWhat matters is whether or not you care about the corner that got cut. e.g. clothing, the premium of a name brand stems from the fact that they're paying designers and setting fashion trends. Kohl's store brand offerings skip that overhead and copy last year's fashion. Do I care about the latest designer business casual fashion? Not really, which is why I pad my work wardrobe with some generic boring shirts. But I do own some nice clothing I won't be embarrassed by on a date.\n\nOther things, the differences are immediate and obvious. Pretty much everything electronic falls in this bucket of sacrificing core specs. I still remember the year my mum got us knock-off Go-Pros to film our skiing. The cut cost-casualty? The knock-off used low quality batteries completely incapable of holding a charge in cold-weather. Made them unusable for their intended purpose to film is skiing.\n\nMy mum never really got out of the poverty mindset of saving a few bucks now only to spend more in the long-term re-buying cheap junk. We had the old argument when I bought a quality rotomolded cooler, \"$170 on a cooler is crazy! Why would you ever spend that!\" Well... Aside from the fact that it works a hell of a lot better, they've bought 5 or 6 $25-30 coolers while mine is showing minimal wear.\n\nAlso store-brand food is rarely the same. All you have to do is flip the cheese packet around and look at the ingredients list. I prefer to spend the extra $2 to ear actual cheese, not vegetable oil with some milk solids and 'natural cheese flavor' whatever that is.",

In no time, people started saying that the Japanese made Fenders were 'low quality junk' because they cost less, even though the opposite was true (and history has borne this out- 1980s MIJ Fenders are now recognized as some of the finest, if not THE finest, lines to ever wear the Fender badge) \n\n\n... but the market at that time wouldn't accept it. Turns out some markets actually WANT to pay more, when the product is viewed as much like a trophy as it is anything else. Charge them more, they're happier with it. Charge them less, they'll move over to someone charging them more. \n\nMalcolm Gladwell also addressed this in his TED talk about Grey Poupon mustard, who discovered this around that time.

In some cases, the product was likely the exact same as the brand name but with a different label. Many times the cases that the store brands would come in were the same ones used to package the brand names, so that was usually a give away. Sometimes, you'd get a brand name slip into the case for the store brand, or you'd get a store brand from a competitor grocery store mixed in with your store brand, so you knew they were exactly the same regardless of the store. Many chain grocers use mid size producers that are regional but maybe not national brands to produce store brands. The benefit to the producer is that they don't have to pay for advertising but see a huge jump in sales volume, which is why they can sell it for less. A store like Trader Joe's is basically built entirely on this concept. Their store brands are produced by larger producers under contract with.

So be sure to read the ingredients carefully and compare the percentages of the \"important\" ingredients. I found vast differences in the pesto alla genovese glasses between the discounters, one had only 2 or 3 percent olive oil and basil wasn't even the first ingredient, but sunflower oil (cheapy cheapy). The other (same price) had basil first and much more olive oil.\nAnd, a personal recommendation, try to stay away from the heavy processed foods. It's always basically a scam, they put together the cheapest shit for a huge revenue. Sure, 1.50€ for a pizza, that's nothing, right? But think about how most of it is insanely cheap yeast dough, equally cheap \"tomato sauce\", and just a couple of salami slices and some cheese sprinkles. Check what yeast costs and how much flour is. I know pizza is a bad example because it's not trivial to make. Chocolate chip cookies are, however, and here again you compare the price of the processed shit with ingredients as bad as possible while retaining the taste and texture, and how many you'd get if you buy the ingredients and make them (and don't even think about that smell in your house when you bake them, can't put a price on that).",

Companies like GE, RCA, Zenith, etc., were no longer making their products in the US.\n\nThe imported products were called \"off brand\", despite \"brand\" names being applied to them.\n\nSadly, it's been this way for over 40 years. Companies have abused the cheap Chinese labor so badly, the position of \"brand\" itself isn't reliable to any degree, especially our food (which is now owned by few corporations rather than multiple businesses).\n\nTo add further confusion to consumers, \"brands\" are now being licensed to manufacturing companies which have no relation whatsoever to the parent company.\n\nGE, for example, no longer makes any electronics sold to consumers. Anytime you see \"GE\", read the package to find out who really makes that light bulb.\n\nPersonally, all this shit should be 100% illegal. If it's illegal to falsely list ingredients in food, it should be illegal to falsely imply the company makes the product, instead of marking it up under \"brand\" recognition.\n\nConsumer advocacy is dead. A few still exist, but people have gladly traded quality for a cheap bargain basement price.\n\nSo much so, US companies have taken notice. Why make quality when people are buying cheaper crap from \"companies\" like \"BUNLUNGLOO\" or \"INDIBLOB\" (hoping these aren't actual companies I made up).",

For example, electrical appliances and the like, don't risk it with the cheap stuff that have people complaining about them breaking down or worse, somehow catching fire on their own.\n\nFor not too important items, it's ok to try out the cheaper brands or knockoffs. For example, if you're a toy collector and you need some stands to help fix your toys into poses like flying or jumping, you can just buy the cheaper versions. An official stand from Japanese toy company Bandai, can cost up to $25 for just a 3 piece set. You can buy a knockoff Chinese version that functions exactly in the same way (actually it's a total copy) for $14 and you get 8 pieces. The quality of plastic is just as strong, but there are little aesthetic imperfections (like tiny negligible air bubbles) that don't really matter.\n\nIn my personal opinion, if it's important, always go for the proven brand names.

I worked in a higher end area of town and the parents of children would come in and would ask why a product is on sale for so much. Or think the pre owned copy was inferior (this was when discs like Blu Ray or the Wii U Panasonic discs) just because it was cheaper and already opened. A third party game would release the same day as a AAA or first party title at maybe 40 or 30 bucks be the better game actually and patents would say it's not as good quailty. \n\nBiggest argument for this was 2004, Madden 04 comes out 50 bucks, NFL 2K5 comes out same day..20 bucks...next year EA buys the NFL license. Even though NFL 2K5 was the updated roster brand new game. When people asked why they bought Madden over NFL2K5 \"I thought 2K5 was the lesser game because of it only being 20 bucks\" Now there is more to why EA got the license after that year but it wiped out anyone else in games trying to make a NFL game. \n\nIt kind of worked the other way too with 3rd party accessories. I would NEVER buy a GameStop branded controller or a mad catz controller of the wireless variety. Just spring for the first party controller it's going to save you money in the long run. Mad Catz or Interact where not bad during SNES or 64 days even the PS2 days but there is a quailty issue now it seems.",

To make a lesser/inferior product palatable; recognize the brand, then to associate the brand to jingles, catchy phrases, good-looking people, good-feelings, etc.\n\nSo the off-branded knock-offs \"worst\" products genesis are the same that branded products (Premise 1), the difference is the lack of a successful branding (Premise 2), whether intentionally or not. And that most branded products usually copy a non-branded \"better\" product to begin with.\n\nExamples:\n\nBeer. Now that \"artisanal beer\" has gained mainstream popularity and availability, I've realized the branded beer is the cheap, less complex, less flavor, watery version of real beer.\n\nPizza. A home made Italian pizza is the real thing; a branded pizza, from a big fast-food chain is the cheaper less quality version of it. Etc.\n\nThis does not meant everything mass produced is inferior to the handcrafted version, but it is a pattern that occurs in many products and services.\n\nThese four things may be true:\nHome made pizza > Good off-brand > Big Brand pizza > Bad off-brand\n\nAnd I'm not talking about convenience or other proprieties but quality alone. In these examples the quality is subjective but imagine other cases were you can measure the quality of the product and the same may apply.\n\nNegative aspects of these two premises are: premise 1 produce worst products but premise 2 negates that fact (when marketing and branding changes or manipulate the consumer perception of the product).   \nPremise 2 costs are transferred to the costumer, and/or the branding is successful enough to allow them to charge more for a lesser quality product; and/or to get away with unfair competitive practices harming the market; to use less healthy cheaper ingredients (example High-fructose corn syrup) harming the consumer, etc.\n\nSome famous Cola brand is both a worst copy of a handcrafted product (the one with coca leaves, \"medicinal beverage\"), and a Branded, the-branded original kind of Cola; yet the current product they sell today (sweetened with High-fructose corn syrup) is in fact a worst version of it's sugar cane iteration; so the Brand may be the same, but it's iterations passed trough the negative outputs of premises 1 plus 2. \nCheaper and worst, but branding allows.\n\n\nTLDR: in many cases the knock-offs /cheaper /less quality/.. products are the branded products.
