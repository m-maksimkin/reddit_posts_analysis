It was taking a lot of effort to get her moving. Every few minutes she would just plop down and look at me wistfully, but I was on a schedule and was oblivious to what it meant. Instead I kept scolding her, lifting her up, forcing her to keep moving. Later that night, she was completely unresponsive to any of the things that had given her so much joy in life, and that's when it hit me that she was in trouble. Brought her immediately to a 24-hour animal hospital, where she was forced to stay overnight (thank god it wasn't her last). Turns out she had an aggressive tumor wrapping itself around and squeezing her main artery, to the point that it was suddenly causing an almost catatonic degree of fatigue.\n\nThe prognosis was fatal but the timeline unclear‚Äîshe had an outside chance at a month or two more‚Äîand the tumor was so enmeshed with the artery that surgery itself could easily have been fatal. So we simply took her home. One hour she would seem fairly normal, the next totally out of it. She only lived two more days, for which I'm still incredibly grateful. I was with her when her last moments came. I shouted to everyone, and we held her as she died, and afterward too. We kept locks of her beautiful tricolor hair.\n\nBut even the knowledge that we'd shared 10 years of love and good times can't stop me from tearing up when I think about that one walk.",

No matter how frustrating it is for you, they don't mean it and being shitty to them isn't going to help things. Not to say punishment can't work, but they need to connect the offending behavior with the punishment.  Better yet, don't put them in a position to fail.

I learned that he might benefit for a long time from some chemo. So I took him to our local vet school to see the cancer vets and it turns out.\n\nHe doesn‚Äôt have cancer at all. His prostate was shedding ‚Äúatypical inflammatory cells‚Äù that look kind of similar to cancer cells. And my first vet decided that was enough. If I‚Äôd have been someone else - I might have decided to just put him to sleep. \n\nToday he got neutered. He‚Äôs only 12.

Then as an adult he remained a delicate flower- if I had a raccoon at the back door or a dog barking, he became upset and peed.\n\nLast June his behavior ramped up- I had to begin obsessively hiding clothes baskets with dirty laundry. Blankets, towels- I couldn't hide the couch so that was ruined. It came to a head one Saturday morning in July. I woke up to bloody urine on my bathroom floor- I immediately panic. Then Frank began acting agitated. He was obsessively licking his genitals and breathing hard. I put him in a dog crate with a litter box to get some sort of urine sample but instead Frank stood with his legs stretched out over the corner *screaming* while struggling to release urine.\n\n$3k+ and almost four days at an emergency vet later he came home diagnosed with FLUTD (he'd been suffering from his since being neutered) which means his urethra blocks up for no fucking reason at all. No surgical fix and a prescription diet for life. What I thought was really extreme anxiety due to environmental factors was an internal disease all along.\n\nAlso, it was insulting as fuck at the ER when the initial vet who examined him was doubting a reason for us to have brought him in at all. It wasn't until he didn't pass any urine for three and a half hours after being put on fluids that they agreed he had a blockage.

            "text": "I‚Äôll ***never*** get the image of my first dog, Steef (German name ‚Äî he was a legit, academy-trained in Germany, German Shepard Police dog but was retired after only 1 year of service due to some medical injury that they didn‚Äôt want to pay to fix/rehabilitate & spend all the extra time to get him ‚Äòaction ready.‚Äô)\n\nInstead, it was much cheaper/faster to just get another healthy pup and train them in the same/less amount of time that Steef would take just to heal/get back to ‚Äònormal.‚Äô\n\nBut he had essentially ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù fully, and knew pretty much all the stuff they were gunna teach him.. he just didn‚Äôt get to put it into practice/‚Äòthe field‚Äô very much before he was laid up, so to speak..\n\nMy dad knew a guy out in Germany who I guess my dad had been talking to about wanting a dog like that, etc.. And so it was like fate that just a month or two later, this guy finds out about Steef and let‚Äôs my dad know the situation and that he would be ***exxxxxppennnsiiiive*** but he would basically be the perfect dog/guardian/friend/etc..\n\nSo my dad legit flew to Germany and bought Steef from the academy for around $17,000 USD or so.  At the time, Steef was only like ~2 years old, if I remember correctly.\n\nI was just barely 4 years old when we got him, so I basically grew up with that dog.. He was a beast; he understood/responded only to German commands, he could EASILY jump our original 8ft tall wooden fences around the property until we made them 12ft, cause he kept trying to get out and ‚Äògo find my dad‚Äô and my dad showed us all his training tricks/commands like how he could literally hold his bladder and maintain a solid bite/locked jaw while staying awake for ***72 hours straight.*** He would only release on my dads command if it was an intruder type situation or my dad was being attacked.  (My dad had to stay in Germany for like a month and live/train w Steef every day before they let my dad take him home ‚Äî basically like an adaptive period for him to acclimate to my dad being his ‚Äònew master.‚Äô So my dad had all these crazy videos showing most of this stuff.. he didn‚Äôt make Steef do any of the gnarly shit back in the states at our home or anything like that. That would be messed up.)\n\nThe crazy thing is that he was also SO loving/protective, etc. He used to push me and my little brother on the swings. And we would run around with nerf guns and shoot each other until Steef saw/heard us - then he would run up and grab the guns away from us and run off and keep them away from us, hahah. Like ‚ÄúNaw, you guys can‚Äôt have these guns. Bad humans. Guns are bad.‚Äù\n\nAnd like one time, a dude broke into our house in the evening/early night time and Steef immediately tackled the dude to the ground & bit the dudes arm.. Then just **pinned** him to the ground.. for over **6 hours** until we all got back from being out of the house (we were all out at the movies & dinner & shopping or ***something*** that took us ~6 hours.. forget what exactly, but that‚Äôs beside the point..) \n\nWhen we got home, we found this dude bleeding on our floor, pinned in place with just pure terror in his eyes. Cops came after we called em.. They take the guy away eventually and one cop comes and talks to us and says that the Dude told the cops that my dog literally wouldn‚Äôt let the guy do **ANYTHING.**\n\nTried to move? Steef bit down harder. Tried to scream for help? Steef bit down harder. Tried to move ANY limb or even turn his head? Steef bit down harder. So the guy just gave up basically and laid there for fucking 6 hours with teeth sunk into his arm almost to the bone.\n\nSteef basically told this dude ‚ÄúYou fucked up and you‚Äôre gunna wait RIGHT HERE until my master & family come home.\n\nMy dad was his ‚ÄòMaster.‚Äô So my dad had ultimate/final authority, but Steef knew we were ‚Äúthe family‚Äù and protected us like crazy too. Used to have new friends have to spend an hour w Steef before they could run around and play freely with us, cause if they touched us or ran around towards/near us.. Steef would bring their ass to the ground. He didn‚Äôt bite anyone unless you fought back. But he was a solid ~120-130 Lbs and could DROP your ass if he tackled you/jumped at your chest.\n\nThen, when I was ~8, my dad went to prison.\n\nSteef became INSANELY depressed.. And he started breaking out of our yard to go chase EVERY large truck that drove by the main road (my dad used to drive the original H1 hummer and I guess it sounded similar enough.)\n\nWell, Steef kept doing this for years and years and years.. Until one day, because he was getting old now and had abused his body so much.. He literally ***BROKE HIS OWN SPINE*** by pulling himself UNDER a TINY hole beneath our fence. He pulled himself so hard to squeeze through this small gap that he broke his own spine and lost control of his rear legs completely.\n\nWe had no idea at first.. He managed to drag himself into the garage with just his front legs.\n\nBut after 2 days, I finally noticed that he wasn‚Äôt just not moving *much* because he was depressed or anything.. but that he literally hadn‚Äôt moved ***at all*** in two entire days. I noticed because he accidentally knocked his food bowl over when we set it down a bit too far away from him and he tried pulling it closer with his front paw, I guess..\n\nBut he knocked it over instead and couldn‚Äôt reach most of the food that spilled..\n\nWhen I saw him like that, I then started to check him out closer and saw there was a puddle of urine that had just been pooling under his back/lower body, but we had a drain in our garage right where he was, so most of it would drain away quickly.. but not all of it. And after 2 days, you could smell it on him now.. \n\nMy god.. the look of pure defeat and sadness and loss of pride that I saw in his eyes when I started crying and petting him and he looked up at me, almost with ***shame*** in his face.. Like he was upset that we found out, not because he was embarrassed or didn‚Äôt want to go to the vet or whatever.. But because he had *failed his job,* in his mind.\n\nHe couldn‚Äôt protect his family anymore.. ‚ÄúWhat will Master do/think if he finally comes back & I‚Äôm like this and can‚Äôt even protect the family he left behind for me to guard?‚Äù\n\nWe immediately tried to load him up in the car to take him to the ER.. and suddenly he got this BURST of strength and fought us SO fucking hard, trying not to leave the door by my dads office outside of the garage.. \n\nFuck. Even now I‚Äôm in tears just thinking about how he just have felt during that drive. He ***HAD*** to have known he wasn‚Äôt coming back.. and that he wouldn‚Äôt see my Dad again before he drew his last breath..\n\nEdit: Added & Expanded on this ‚Äî Continues in reply, as well.",

In one case my cat has a severe batter infection caused by crystals in the urine and the high ash food content of \"Meow Mix\".

None of these are their fault.\n\n**Even better LPT:** Don't punish your pet.\n\nNegative reinforcement is almost never the right way to teach your pets how to behave.\n\nI mean, if every time you went into the bathroom and took a piss someone came in and beat you, would you understand where they expected you to go to the bathroom? Or would you justl be very confused and start developing weird anxiety and complexes around trying to take a piss such that when someone finally dragged you to where you were supposed to piss you'd just think \"Man, idk, I think I'd rather try and hold it literally forever because I don't want another beating.\".\n\nOr, let's say you scold your pet every time they growl or get aggressive. Great way to train that out of them, right? Lol no. What's going to happen is they're still going to feel the aggression, and as long as you're around and it never reaches a breaking point they'll keep it under control. Meanwhile, you've trained them to _stop giving you a warning_ in the form of a growl. You wanna know how you get from \"He's a total sweetheart!\" to a kid tormenting them and then \"I don't understand what happened or why he removed that child's entire face!\"? It's shit like that.\n\nYou want your pet to do what you want?\n\n1. Reward good behaviour.\n2. Don't reward bad behaviour.\n3.

She stated frantically pacing, bumping into walls, losing bladder control, howling and she never howled before. It was terrifying.

Except... My dog, as most dogs, can't just do that. She has to wait for us to get home or realise she's asking to be walked, and sometimes that just doesn't happen fast enough.",

Either way, as long as she's on it she has no potty issues. \n\nBut I'm a firm believer you should never scold your animal for going in the house even as a puppy. Our trainer said you can't    discipline after the fact. You need to catch them in the moment, a simple no and then take them out and praise them everytime they go in the right location. All commands should be in a neutral tone. Corrections should be low, and praises should be high. Something that helped us as a puppy was they make these pee stakes you stick in the ground and it has pheromones and I swear it works. \n\nFor some animals, it's just bc they don't communicate the same. My dog gets excited when she has to pee.. she will come up to you and look like she wants to cuddle.. she never goes to the door or barks. So take time to learn your animals signs. And as this post says, if they haven't previously had issues consider whether they've had the opportunity to go out, otherwise it is probably a medical issue. \n\nOptions for cats, there is a litter that changes color with urinary issues, also litter robot tracks how frequently your pet goes. \n\nFor older dogs, I highly recommend pee pads for when you aren't home. Our dog knows to use it when she needs to like if I'm at work, I come home during lunch to let her out. And I never deny taking her out bc if I was in her or my cats shoes having to rely on someone else to take me out or clean my litter that would suck. So people that get upset, get upset at yourself. Yes it sucks especially when they are sick or it's a medical issue that you're having to clean up or go out over and over.. but you basically signed up for a kid. You guys got this(: \n\nIf it's in regards to marking.. invest in some good pee removal cleaning stuff, if it works great if not, discard it. Alot of homes having remaining pee from the last owners, when we moved all the marking stopped. Consider shifting things around, if they pee in the laundry, make it inaccessible or put it away.. there's these air cans with motion detectors that are supposed to startle them from messing with it, or maybe it's a conflict of space so set up a more enriching area. There's a million things.. but just remember your pets whatever they are, deserve your love and consideration(:",

            "text": "A few more tips about house training dogs that no one will ever see:\n\nDogs don‚Äôt really need to be scolded at all, you just build a routine and they learn house training that way. Of course some dogs don‚Äôt take to it as easy, but rubbing their nose in it or smacking them is never necessary, especially if you don‚Äôt catch them in the act then it‚Äôs entirely pointless. The furthest I‚Äôve ever had to go is yelling when I catch my puppy in the act to try to get them to stop and interrupt them. \n\nIf your dog has an accident as an adult and is house trained it‚Äôs probably a genuine accident. They didn‚Äôt want to go inside. If you were gone too long, they were sick, or they just happened to drink too much water, it‚Äôs all excusable and you shouldn‚Äôt scold them anyway. \n\nScolding an elderly dog for starting to become incontinent is wrong even if there‚Äôs no other health issues and it‚Äôs just them being old.\n\nAlso keep in mind smaller dogs have smaller bladders and may have trouble house training more, because they need to go back outside more often, so if you‚Äôre lax on that they learn to just go in the house. \n\nStop seeing your pets as doing things to spite you people. I know firsthand, too‚Ä¶ I was raised to think you rubbed their nose in it and smacked them. That was stupid and bad and I regret it. Then as an adult I did research before getting my next puppy‚Ä¶ turns out just taking them out a bunch and trying to interrupt when they start to go in the house is the actual way you‚Äôre supposed to do it.",

Two hands around the neck and a good shake. A real punishment choke. A learning experience if you would. Turns out the dog had Cushing‚Äôs disease  and its retinas detached during the shaking from  me choking it. The dog was then permanently blind. It was awful. It was scared and erratic, it drove my wife and I crazy. I thought this was me being haunted by my actions. Boy was I wrong. We finally put that blind bastard to sleep but I am haunted more now that it is dead than I ever was when it was alive and tripping over everything causing injury to itself daily to the point of me needing to nurture it.",
