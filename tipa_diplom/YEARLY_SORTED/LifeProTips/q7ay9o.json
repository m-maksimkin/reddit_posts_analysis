    "LPT: Don’t bother giving more than a two week notice.\nHad a coworker put in his notice until the end of the year. Told them he’s going back to school starting the first, but wanted to give enough notice to hire and help train someone to take over for him so we wouldn’t be down a person. \n\nThey decided that two weeks is enough, so now he won’t be getting paid, except for potential unemployment which is significantly less than what he makes now, for the next two months. If he would’ve just kept his mouth shut and not tried to help them, he would’ve continued to get paid and then could’ve given a two week notice. \n\nDon’t try to help the company. They have no interest in helping you, just helping themselves.": [

            "text": ">Don't bother giving more than a two week notice\n\nFirstly in lots of companies a month is the norm, and 3 months isn't uncommon, so this isn't a tip that's relevant to everyone.\n\nSecondly there's lots of reasons to give more notice. Perhaps you actually want to maintain good relationships with colleagues and the company.\n\nA few years ago I was quitting my job to go travelling. I already had the flight booked so I gave ~2.5 month's notice (my contract was 1 month).\n\nI'm now back working for the company. When they had a vacancy they contacted me straight away, I got the job back (with a healthy payrise). Obviously that's not all because I gave a long notice, but generally my reputation and relationship with them, which the notice was just one part of.\n\nSimilarly in a much older job I gave a longer notice than necessary. Since I left my old manager has contacted me numerous times to offer me a job.\n\nSometimes it's good to build strong relationships. Sometimes you can't trust the company. Blanket \"tips\" like this aren't relevant to everyone and you shouldn't make such bold black and white statements as \"don't try to help the company. They have no interest in helping you\".\n\nEdit: in the first line I meant to say \"lots of countries\" not \"companies\".",

Told them on a Wednesday. I was acting in good faith of communicating what I knew when I knew it. I was also counting on the last two ish months of pay as my new job was that far away. \n\nI checked in on our Friday EOD state-of-things meeting, making sure everyone was aware of any work I needed to hand off that wouldn’t be complete in the long timeframe I generously provided them. Everyone was cool as shit about it, very congratulatory. Not a word about anything other than what we were expected to be working on when the weekend was over.\n\nMonday morning I make my hour-ish commute in and am called into the bosses office where he’s got a box of my stuff ready to go, as they had my replacement already in the office, at my desk starting work. \n\nThankfully, I was cognizant enough to recognize that I needed to get them to put in writing that they didn’t have any work for me and that I wasn’t fired due to poor performance, nor did I quit. I told the boss I may need to find employment for the next two months to make ends meet and I didn’t want it to appear that I planned poorly or that I fucked up.

They fought the unemployment, saying I quit. \n\nI had it in writing that I didn’t, and I eventually got the money but it was not for a good few months after I was already settled in to the new job before the state even gave the cash to me.\n\nI have given one weeks notice ever since.

Obviously they don't want to give someone a paycheck if they don't even work there. Thankfully I heard this was the case before I put in my 2 weeks. So when they gave me the paper to sign, I told them I was going to have a lawyer take a look at it. They said inl wasn't allowed to.

            "text": "Employers are growing more and more hesitant to let people work out their notice for a number of reasons. There’s an obvious security risk on their end, especially when employees have access to customer, vendor or proprietary information. This goes without saying if the employee is staying within the same industry. They also don’t want a mounting morale issue affecting existing employees due to there being a potential period of grievance airing on behalf of the employee leaving. If there’s a sense that any kind of conflict could occur or relationship deterioration, it’s pretty standard to cut ties sooner rather than later. Most will go ahead and pay out for the time throughout the notice. They also know that in more cases than not, they’re not going to get much actual productivity through the notice period. Other employees will observe this and sometimes a cascading effect occurs where people reduce their output alongside their co-worker that’s leaving. I’m not advocating that the employers are correct assuming these things will occur, but they’ve experienced plenty of it before. The employee in good standing that has done a good job and decides to leave for whatever unrelated reason risks even their two week notice being met with resistance or skepticism through no fault of their own. No employee should have their integrity questioned because they want to pursue another opportunity, but a lengthy notice will definitely change the way management, leadership or even coworkers view you. Is it what it is, so don’t take it personal if the employer takes action that make it seem like they don’t trust you.",

My husband is a teacher and told his school it's his last year there at the start of the year - but they're severely understaffed and there's a massive teaching shortage so they're just glad he's sticking it out! There are a LOT of projects on his shoulders that he'll be working on handing off to less senior teachers and admin this year. Totally depends on your relationship with your boss and your seniority in your job, I think. \n\nAlso, never neglect the \"I'll keep doing my job until you find someone new, but I'll be a contracted consultant and you'll have to pay me 3x my current rate\" angle!

I told them I would rather start early because $$$$. (Also if you’ve been in healthcare recently, burnout is real from ALL positions especially those who work in direct contact with patients so I was kinda desperate to leave). Once I told both managers that I would prefer to start earlier (without telling them why), my boss essentially wasted a week before agreeing to the early start date. While I was waiting this week, I couldn’t put in my official notice because I didn’t have a date to give them. So in the end my boss wasted a week of being able to look for other people because she “couldn’t put a job posting out until she got that letter.” A week after I started at my new job, two other people ended up quitting.

I knew the people that would be most hurt if I just up and quit without notice would be my friends and the people I liked, so didn’t want to screw them.\n\nThey actually asked me to stay on an extra pay period to train a person for a week, which I decided to do. Since our pay periods are two weeks, I basically got an extra week of pay where I wasn’t working at all unless they called me asking questions.\n\nFor the most part they were appreciative of the notice, only reason I say that is because they were mad to lose me because they all generally thought I was great at my job and I was good friends with quite a few of them. Also middle of the year is a really bad time to fill a job in that field. But they knew I wasn’t happy with the job anymore and on a personal level they didn’t want me to stay in a job that I wasn’t happy with anymore.",

In other words, if a future employer does a reference check and asks whether you’re eligible for rehire, the past employer could simply answer “no” without explanation, painting a poor picture. On the other hand, giving more than required notice could backfire as others have mentioned. And you probably won’t be eligible for unemployment for any time more than the agreement called for. So, giving 6 weeks notice when two is required, and not having another job lined up for 6 weeks, could result in you not getting paid for 4 weeks.

I WASN'T. i only made $11 an hour and was driving in the dead of winter up and down hilly ass roads in N/W Pennsylvania some of which had no winter maintenance. Snow 3 feet deep on a dirt road in the middle of no where with no cell service on the company phone or my phone. I was once told to take the trip of the day (driving and delivering to all the costumers for that day) normally i would be fine with it but i had told my direct manager a the day before that i needed to renew my license at lunch time tomorrow as it was my birthday. The owner didn't get the memo somehow. so i politely informed him the other driver would have to take it so i can get my license renewed at lunch time. He then went to tell the other guy and that guy said he couldn't do it for whatever reason that pissed him off. he came back and told me to drive a fully loaded box truck with no license and to renew tomorrow. I straight up and looked him in the eyes and said no. The manager said i could go at lunch today to renew it and that was what i was going to do. He started screaming and throwing things. I just stood there and waited for about 15 minutes and let him yell. When he finally stopped i asked him if he was done acting like a 2 year old. He walked away. I then got offered a job that payed me 900$ a week compared to the 700 i was getting every 2 weeks and put in my 2 week notice. I worked 9 out of the 10 days i committed to. They wanted me to drive my last day i said hell no to the other driver he went and told the owner i wasn't planning on driving my last day. The owner came and shook my hand and said thanks for the 2 years of service we do not need you tomorrow. I fought for 3 out of the 9 days to get my vacation pay payed out it was a nightmare but they eventually paid me. (p.s One of my former co workers made manager status a few months ago and wanted to hire me back so bad but they wouldn't pay me even the 11 an hour i was making and said i can only come back at 10 an hour like every other new driver.

So pretty much I was the only one saying anything to the main manager. Told him how we all felt and how were all applying to new work and how I’ve been called for more money but I love the place I work for and yeah tried to get the ceo to come talk to us and he never came down at all. I took an unpaid half day from my supervisor in the warehouse which he was okay with. I showed up the next day to work and pretty much got sent home cause I said two other jobs called me back after I left for my half day.

Someone wanted to ask for a mortgage to buy a new house, while I knew his contract would not be converted into an indefinite one and thus expire in 3 months. Out of ethical considerations decided to tell him. Poor choice, as toxicity rose to unsustainable levels and we had to send him home to protect the rest of the group. Took months to restore things, just because we thought we should be kind to an employee. The stupid thing is that this problem was created by labour regulations. Where I live, there are too strict rules for termination and quite a few loopholes for fraud by employees. Add to this another stupid rule that you need to offer someone a indefinite employment contract after a couple of temporary ones, and you see where this goes. We just weren't convinced that this guy was right for us and we were right for him in five years, but continuing the relationship would be a forced marriage of some sorts: We could not divorce unless he would be an abusive spouse. No sane person would enact that rule in marriage law, but in labour law this is seen as a reasonable rule. So, we had no choice really than to break of the relationship, even if we still believed in the employee for the medium term. Life as a manager is not all its cracked up to be. \n\nSo, as a general rule, as in love and friendship, be careful what you expect from others when you tell them that you or they are soon no longer to be part of the group. Only people with really high moral standards are capable of fulfilling all their obligations at the end of the ride (compare to divorce with kids).",

If you are a low level employee in a large company - or even some small companies, then 2 weeks is normally sufficient. However, there are a number of circumstances where giving more than 2 weeks is the better move. For example, if you are a key employee - such as a manager, then more than 2 weeks might be worthwhile. Especially if you have a strong relationship with the company and want to leave on the best possible terms. Same if you work for a small business with few employees and your departure will have a significant impact.\n\nAnother reason you might give more than 2 weeks is if you do project based work and want to finish your current projects without being assigned new ones. Especially if you are doing projects for outside clients. \n\nI recently left a job as the general manager of a movie theatre after 22 years with the company. I gave 30 days notice and spent the majority of my last month finishing projects and creating documentation. I wasn't overly concerned about the needs of the company, but the person taking over for me was a long time assistant manager and friend. It was a priority to me to leave her in the best possible situation to succeed after I was gone. The company is very small, and there was very little institutional knowledge beyond what I would be taking with me.\n\nI've been burned by giving early notice and having my employer let me go early. Which left me short on income for a period of time. So I really do understand your point. However, there are a number of personal reasons why someone might choose to give a long notice, and the decision is perfectly valid.",

I was the first person to ever give notice in the companies history, let alone in writing. That was the norm in that industry and people got hired back later.\n\nAnother company I gave written notice and they begged me for additional time. After nearly a month the new company said they couldn't wait any longer and I needed to be there the following week. That's when I found out my manager hadn't even been looking for a replacements, and was still whinnying about how inconvenient my leaving would be. Easy answer there, offer me what I asked for in the interview rather than the 33% less I settled for just because I didn't want to travel.\n\nFinally, I had a sales job and the prior year had been the only employees globally to not just hit my target, but beat it by 48%! They used the fact that no one else made their numbers as an excuse for why I couldn't get a merritt based raise. A few months later, they restructured and I was laid off?\n\nThis was when it hit me. They expect notice and undying loyalty, but feel like your last paycheck is the limit of responsibility to you. In the future if a good opportunity arises and they want me now, I'll happily go because employers have set a zero notice precedent. That said, I have given every employer notice since that realization because the new employers need was never immediate.\n\nMy last employer has reached out twice in the last six months offering a 50% raise and signing bonus, but I still prefer my current position.
