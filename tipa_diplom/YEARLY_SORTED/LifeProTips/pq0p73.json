    "LPT: If your dog runs up to someone and they ask you to call the dog back, your first response should be \"HERE!\" or whatever your recall cue is, not \"Why?\", \"He just wants to play\" or \"It's okay he's friendly\".\nIt doesn't matter why they've requested it but there's a good chance that it's for your own dogs safety.\n\nPerhaps the person is scared of dogs.\n\nMaybe they're with a child who is scared of dogs.\n\nThey might have a dog on a lead who is dog aggressive or scared of other dogs.\n\nThere could be machinery that's dangerous for your dog to be around.\n\nThey might have livestock with them.\n\nThey might have spotted other wildlife that could either cause harm to or be harmed by your dog.\n\nBut it doesn't matter. Honour the request and call your dog back, then if you're curious, you can ask why or what's happening. If you don't take heed of the warning and your dog gets injured then it's your fault. If your dog is improperly trained and you *can't* call your dog back then A) it's again your fault if it gets injured and B) it has no business being off lead.": [

But also remember this: sometimes there is a reason not to shout the recall command, and if you've come to an area where people are likely to be training dogs, try to be understanding.\n\nIf someone's playful/friendly dog is undergoing off-leash training, occasionally it won't come back. 'Recall regression' is just part of growing up and learning for dogs under 2 years old. It isn't predictable, affecting even perfectly trained dogs at random from time to time. At that age, they're still developing and hormones are high, which can cause erratic behaviour. It's just part of having a dog, and some dogs are harder to train than others.\n\nThe recommended course of action here is to let the other person know that the dog is friendly, walk calmly/slowly up to it, and leash it, which sounds a lot like what you're describing.\n\nThe absolute worst thing to do when your dog fails to recall is to keep shouting the recall command, or their name. All that does is basically train the dog to ignore recall even harder.\n\nIf you run after the dog, or show any urgency, it becomes a game of chase.\n\nAs the owner of a very friendly, excitable puppy, I only let mine off where it either isn't a problem, or I know he'll come back. However, sometimes people turn up to the local off-leash park with anxious/reactive/leashed dogs. I have no idea why anyone would do this, as it's a bummer for everyone else who brings their playful dogs there to excercise and socialise off leash. So I guess I'm saying, if you're going to a known area for dogs to play, you gotta kinda expect to encounter playful dogs.",

I was out for a run with him when while running through a park, a German Shepard puppy bolted after us. It was off leash and exploring the park while it‚Äôs owner was meandering around calling out to it every so often. Keep in mind, this is a regular park with no fences or gates. It wasn‚Äôt an off leash dog park. I didn‚Äôt want the puppy to keep following us so I stopped so the owner could come get it. I hugged my sisters dog to keep it from turning around and confronting the puppy who was trying to smell his butt. \n\nThe owner of the puppy, still about 20 metres away shouts ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok he‚Äôs friendly‚Äù. Irritated, I shout back ‚Äúwell mine isn‚Äôt!‚Äù\n\nThe owner strolls over and says ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm just training my dog‚Äù. As soon as he grabs his dog I let go of mine and we continue our run. \n\nI was blown away by this guys total lack of understanding of how to train a puppy. An open PUBLIC park next to a busy street with no fences is not a safe place for that puppy to be off leash. And his lack of urgency when I let him know my dog wasn‚Äôt friendly was frustrating. This was about halfway through the Covid lockdowns in my country when there was a huge surge in people getting puppies.

I had to let them pass because it was impossible for me to avoid my dogs wild tantrums and still walk. She got nuts and even bit me sometimes if I didn‚Äôt hold her away from me. I‚Äôm a rural area and very rarely had to worry about this. Most of the time we had very peaceful walks. \n\nOne day we decided to go to a open to the public park-like place. There was only one other car. Of course it was a guy with an off leash dog. (We do have a leash law, but if you can control your dog verbally it‚Äôs okay to off leash). They were quite a ways away when his dog saw mine and I yelled to him to call his dog.  There is plenty of time and space to get his dog, at this point.\nHe replies ‚ÄúToby is friendly‚Ä¶ just wants to play.‚Äù\nI say ‚Äúmine isn‚Äôt friendly please call your dog‚Äù\nHe yells ‚Äúwhat are you doing up here then?!?‚Äù\nI say ‚ÄúI have just as much right as you!!‚Äù\nAt this time his dog isn‚Äôt listening and I‚Äôm trying to be a wall between his dog and my dog while firmly saying to his dog ‚Äúno. Go away. Go home. No.‚Äù\nHe finally gets his dog and is annoyed with me. I‚Äôm annoyed with him because this isn‚Äôt a dog park and his dog clearly didn‚Äôt give a shit that he was being called.

My personal experience with this issue, I was walking my dog at the dog beach. Dogs are allowed off lead at all times and is the only dog beach in the area that services thousands of people. My dog who was 8months at the time regular runs ahead of me sniffing, and playing with other dogs along the way. He also loves to say hello to people so goes up to them and gets a pat. He went up to one person to say hello and that person screamed and yelled at me and my pup for doing so. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What the hell lady ? You are walking on a dog beach, you obviously have a fear of dogs what the hell are you doing here. Don‚Äôt yell and abuse me and my dog we are here every day and this is the only place he is allowed off lead. I just dont understand it.",

We were on a narrow section of trail, and saw another dog ahead (surprisingly on leash). We stopped, and tried to figure out where to go but the brush was pretty thick. The other woman immediately stopped, moved her dog off trail, and physically corralled him. We had a brief conversation about my dogs issues and her dog's excitability, She let us pass with no problems. Her young daughter asked to pet my dog, but we said no, she's shy. The response was \"OK, thank you. She's very pretty\". No arguments, no whining. It made my day to have somebody so empathetic and understanding, and she was obviously teaching her daughter the right way to behave as well.

I yell back yeah well mine isn't. I'm standing between my kid and dog and her 3 dogs telling her I'll kick her dogs if she doesn't get them away. The other dad that was there steps in and helps so I can get away. I was fuming mad that I couldn't tell her off myself but I was trying to remove my family from the crappy situation she put us in.. The dad laid into her for being so stupid and careless and then grabbed his 2 kids and left. She was standing there not understanding what she did wrong.. I could see from a distance.

When you have your dog in a public place and I tell you to control your dog, **CONTROL YOUR DAMN DOG.**\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt fucking matter why I or anyone else says it. It‚Äôs your responsibility to control your goddamn dog and you need to do it or expect some serious wrath to come your way.  This is what leashes are for.  If you can‚Äôt control your dog then you need to put it on a damn leash when you‚Äôre in public.  **PERIOD.**  I don‚Äôt trust my dogs not to do something stupid like yours is doing and bother other people.  Guess what: I do right by others around me and walk them with a damn leash.\n\nIf you can‚Äôt tell, I‚Äôve come close to both myself and my dogs getting severely injured and killed because of this shit.  I‚Äôm just trying to walk through a public park with my dogs.  On a leash, bothering no one.  Most recent time I was having a bad day anyway and I just blew up at this old woman who‚Äôs idiot dog ran up, next thing you know I‚Äôm on the ground and my dog‚Äôs leashes were all tangled in between each other‚Äôs legs. If either of my dogs had tried to bolt they could have really hurt the other one or themselves, and of course the idiot dog is acting aggressive.\n\nOld lady too, got an attitude with me, talking about how she comes to the park all the time.  I really didn‚Äôt give a shit and so I just kept yelling louder over her ‚ÄúI DONT CARE LADY. CONTROL YOUR FUCKING DOG,‚Äù etc.  That shit really irked me.\n\nAnd don‚Äôt you dare try and argue mine need more socialization, either.  They‚Äôre as socialized as they‚Äôre going to get and it‚Äôs none of your damn business how socialized they are.\n\nIt‚Äôs **your** fucking dog that needs the training and attention.  It‚Äôs **you** overstepping your bounds and putting others in danger and you‚Äôve shown it by your dog causing problems for other people because you clearly did not having proper control of your canine in public.

It's always the owner who doesn't think there dog needs a leash. \n\nOne story goes as follows.  I had a non dog friendly dog so on walks I would muzzle her and have a bright leash that said not dog friendly on her. The muzzle was just in case for some reason she got free of me and I couldn't recall her. Didn't want to take the risk of her biting anyone. Anyways I was walking her like normal and I see someone dog up ahead come out of the owners car no leash on. I immediately turn around to go back the way I came. Next thing I know I can hear the owner calling to there dog and I turn back around to their dog lunging at mine. Of course my poor girl is handicapped, so I intervene. Now I'm not saying that was smart of me, and anyone can debate the morals of my next decisions, but when you have another dog literally biting into yours it get complicated fast. Well I did tried to get between the dog and kicked at the dog and flung a fist at it. Which was probably the worst decision as this is when there dog bit into my arm. I still have a slight scar ten years later. \n\n\nSo keep your dogs on a leash people. I don't care how well trained your dog is. Also can we talk about people just letting cats run around outside.
