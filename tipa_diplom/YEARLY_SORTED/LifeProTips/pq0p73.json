    "LPT: If your dog runs up to someone and they ask you to call the dog back, your first response should be \"HERE!\" or whatever your recall cue is, not \"Why?\", \"He just wants to play\" or \"It's okay he's friendly\".\nIt doesn't matter why they've requested it but there's a good chance that it's for your own dogs safety.\n\nPerhaps the person is scared of dogs.\n\nMaybe they're with a child who is scared of dogs.\n\nThey might have a dog on a lead who is dog aggressive or scared of other dogs.\n\nThere could be machinery that's dangerous for your dog to be around.\n\nThey might have livestock with them.\n\nThey might have spotted other wildlife that could either cause harm to or be harmed by your dog.\n\nBut it doesn't matter. Honour the request and call your dog back, then if you're curious, you can ask why or what's happening. If you don't take heed of the warning and your dog gets injured then it's your fault. If your dog is improperly trained and you *can't* call your dog back then A) it's again your fault if it gets injured and B) it has no business being off lead.": [

But also remember this: sometimes there is a reason not to shout the recall command, and if you've come to an area where people are likely to be training dogs, try to be understanding.\n\nIf someone's playful/friendly dog is undergoing off-leash training, occasionally it won't come back. 'Recall regression' is just part of growing up and learning for dogs under 2 years old. It isn't predictable, affecting even perfectly trained dogs at random from time to time. At that age, they're still developing and hormones are high, which can cause erratic behaviour. It's just part of having a dog, and some dogs are harder to train than others.\n\nThe recommended course of action here is to let the other person know that the dog is friendly, walk calmly/slowly up to it, and leash it, which sounds a lot like what you're describing.\n\nThe absolute worst thing to do when your dog fails to recall is to keep shouting the recall command, or their name. All that does is basically train the dog to ignore recall even harder.\n\nIf you run after the dog, or show any urgency, it becomes a game of chase.\n\nAs the owner of a very friendly, excitable puppy, I only let mine off where it either isn't a problem, or I know he'll come back. However, sometimes people turn up to the local off-leash park with anxious/reactive/leashed dogs. I have no idea why anyone would do this, as it's a bummer for everyone else who brings their playful dogs there to excercise and socialise off leash. So I guess I'm saying, if you're going to a known area for dogs to play, you gotta kinda expect to encounter playful dogs.",

Thankfully I knew her and knew she was great with big dogs, so I shouted out the window “his name is Syd!!!” She shouted “Syd? Okay, I got this!” And by the time I ran around the house to hoist him in, they were best friends (he adores her now!).  \n\nThat was a lucky encounter for me, I’m 99.9/100 really on the ball.  He’s so loud and intimidating and I know how that must feel for people who don’t know him so I’m extra vigilant about keeping him away from strangers and if they ask about him, I explain and let them get to know him (which he loves as he is a big flirt!). He’s never bitten anyone, and I know he wouldn’t, but a stranger doesn’t know that.  Every time I need something doing in the house, building work, decorating, or utilities, I always ask for people who are okay with big dogs and then when they come to the door I ask if it’s okay for my dog to meet them outside first. So far they’ve all been brilliant, and Syd goes out to meet them, gets a load of fuss and adores them from then on out. I do apologise for the rigmarole but at the end of the day, I live in the middle of nowhere with three kids and my dog would scare off any one coming around with nefarious intentions.  \n\nI would never question anyone asking me to call back my dog, in fact they wouldn’t have chance to because I either keep him on a lead or call him back straight away.

            "text": "I was walking my sisters 5 year old German Shepard. He’s a good boy, but territorial when on leash. I was out for a run with him when while running through a park, a German Shepard puppy bolted after us. It was off leash and exploring the park while it’s owner was meandering around calling out to it every so often. Keep in mind, this is a regular park with no fences or gates. It wasn’t an off leash dog park. I didn’t want the puppy to keep following us so I stopped so the owner could come get it. I hugged my sisters dog to keep it from turning around and confronting the puppy who was trying to smell his butt. \n\nThe owner of the puppy, still about 20 metres away shouts “it’s ok he’s friendly”. Irritated, I shout back “well mine isn’t!”\n\nThe owner strolls over and says “sorry I’m just training my dog”. As soon as he grabs his dog I let go of mine and we continue our run. \n\nI was blown away by this guys total lack of understanding of how to train a puppy. An open PUBLIC park next to a busy street with no fences is not a safe place for that puppy to be off leash. And his lack of urgency when I let him know my dog wasn’t friendly was frustrating. This was about halfway through the Covid lockdowns in my country when there was a huge surge in people getting puppies. I feel as if one should have to get a license and do training before they are allowed to own an animal.",

However, she was very protective and aggressive or maybe just scared when other dogs and sometimes men approached. She would red zone even if the other dog was on the other side of the road. I had to let them pass because it was impossible for me to avoid my dogs wild tantrums and still walk. She got nuts and even bit me sometimes if I didn’t hold her away from me. I’m a rural area and very rarely had to worry about this. Most of the time we had very peaceful walks. \n\nOne day we decided to go to a open to the public park-like place. There was only one other car. Of course it was a guy with an off leash dog. (We do have a leash law, but if you can control your dog verbally it’s okay to off leash). They were quite a ways away when his dog saw mine and I yelled to him to call his dog.  There is plenty of time and space to get his dog, at this point.\nHe replies “Toby is friendly… just wants to play.”\nI say “mine isn’t friendly please call your dog”\nHe yells “what are you doing up here then?!?”\nI say “I have just as much right as you!!”\nAt this time his dog isn’t listening and I’m trying to be a wall between his dog and my dog while firmly saying to his dog “no. Go away. Go home. No.”\nHe finally gets his dog and is annoyed with me. I’m annoyed with him because this isn’t a dog park and his dog clearly didn’t give a shit that he was being called. It’s a huge open area on top of a mountain with a lovely view of the lake below. \nAnyway. Was just really annoyed that I got back talk from a dude when I nicely requested he get his dog before something happened.",

We were on a narrow section of trail, and saw another dog ahead (surprisingly on leash). We stopped, and tried to figure out where to go but the brush was pretty thick. The other woman immediately stopped, moved her dog off trail, and physically corralled him. We had a brief conversation about my dogs issues and her dog's excitability, She let us pass with no problems. Her young daughter asked to pet my dog, but we said no, she's shy. The response was \"OK, thank you. She's very pretty\". No arguments, no whining. It made my day to have somebody so empathetic and understanding, and she was obviously teaching her daughter the right way to behave as well. I wish we had at least got her name, somebody that nice is somebody I'd like to meet again.",

Trust me any thing that happens with this particularly dog - even if attacked by another dog or human, he doesn’t defend himself enough, so my dog is the most at risk cause he is the goodest boy. It wouldn’t occur to him that a human might hurt him because we never put him in a setting where that could happen!) \n\nbut you’re an idiot if you let dogs off leash in a setting that isn’t approps, like a dog park for like size breeds with equally Good socialization and training. And then have effective call back under extreme circumstances (prey drive, fear drive etc). And even then be on guard all the time and be trained yourself to defend your dog and know how to separate him for safety of him, from aggressive other dogs / humans, thank god I got trained with my dog. Best classes ever. We had unlimited membership. Until he didn’t ever go like years later. He was a rescue, I’m sad cause he is about 8-9 (can’t be sure, no records, guesstimating ... sis is a vet tho so can only use physical attributes DNA testing and teeth analysis). And he is riddled with cancer. There’s no treatment no matter what. We’ve been giving him the best year of his life we hope. It crushes me when I think about it I feel like I’m suffocating.\n\nShit people who were supposed to have a socialized animal had a dog date with my sis puppy under 10 -11 months old, Bernese, wasn’t even like 10 lb yet the poor little thing, got mauled by their dumb dog cause they “didn’t watch thinking their dog would be fine “ and “cleaned up toys and food” - turned out they missed a toy and the pupper picked it up and the “sitter dog” aka like a supposedly mature dog for socialization and training with families who are supposed to b very like well vetted lol? But ya, fuckin killed her in like 10 seconds with a throat shake? And she lived for a couple hours after to make it to hospital, no treatment possible. That dog was 8x her weight. The fuck were those people thinking allowing an animal like that to be sitting with puppies most importantly UNSUPERVISED because just knowing you’re there is enough to deter shit behaviour a decent proportion of the time, otherwise intervene.

I never know what dog hes going to react to so I just assume he will react to all of them.\n\nSo my son is playing at the park with 2 other kids whose dad is with them. I'm standing off in the grass nearby with my dog who is chewing sticks and having the time of his life. This lady drives up and let's 3 dogs out of her car all without being on leashes. I see this happening and start dragging my dog in the opposite direction while screaming at my kid \"let's go\" while also telling my dog to \"leave it\" and \"no.\" The dogs run up to us and this lady is yelling dont worry they're friendly.. I yell back yeah well mine isn't. I'm standing between my kid and dog and her 3 dogs telling her I'll kick her dogs if she doesn't get them away. The other dad that was there steps in and helps so I can get away. I was fuming mad that I couldn't tell her off myself but I was trying to remove my family from the crappy situation she put us in.. The dad laid into her for being so stupid and careless and then grabbed his 2 kids and left. She was standing there not understanding what she did wrong.. I could see from a distance. She threw her hands up and everything like we were being overdramatic. \n\nI was at the park a few days later talking to another mom and shared the story. She asked if the dogs and lady looked a specific way and I was like yes do you know them?? She told me that lady was her neighbor and they have had multiple incidents of her dogs coming up to their daughter who is allergic and that they had to keep filing complaints with the apartment complex. We moved a couple weeks later so i dont know how it ended, but I couldn't believe after all the complaints this lady still didn't think she was in the wrong.",

Once, twice, three times, fetch didn’t usually last long with a big dog that wasn’t a fan of running for long. On one of the subsequent throws he runs to the stick and stops. I’m not surprised and assume our game of fetch has concluded. Instead he’s standing there wagging his tail like crazy. I follow his gaze and 30 yards away or so there’s a girl frozen still. I know the poor girl is terrified and I don’t want to make it worse.\n\nMy next choice of words probably wasn’t the best.\n\nI simply say…\n\n“Don’t run.”\n\nOf course she immediately turns and runs the other direction back towards the parking lot, screaming the whole time.\n\nRoland is excited that he has a new friend to play with and the chase ensues.

It's always the owner who doesn't think there dog needs a leash. \n\nOne story goes as follows.  I had a non dog friendly dog so on walks I would muzzle her and have a bright leash that said not dog friendly on her. The muzzle was just in case for some reason she got free of me and I couldn't recall her. Didn't want to take the risk of her biting anyone. Anyways I was walking her like normal and I see someone dog up ahead come out of the owners car no leash on. I immediately turn around to go back the way I came. Next thing I know I can hear the owner calling to there dog and I turn back around to their dog lunging at mine. Of course my poor girl is handicapped, so I intervene. Now I'm not saying that was smart of me, and anyone can debate the morals of my next decisions, but when you have another dog literally biting into yours it get complicated fast. Well I did tried to get between the dog and kicked at the dog and flung a fist at it. Which was probably the worst decision as this is when there dog bit into my arm. I still have a slight scar ten years later. \n\n\nSo keep your dogs on a leash people. I don't care how well trained your dog is. Also can we talk about people just letting cats run around outside.

            "text": "Couple years ago, I was at a park, and this dog (I can’t remember what Brand Of Dog, it was medium size) was running around off-leash. I’m really scared of dogs (bad childhood experience), so I was trying to avoid it, until the dog tackled some random toddler to the ground and the toddler started screaming and I realised that I had to distract the dog to save this three year old, no matter how scared I was. Eventually the owner called the dog back and started yelling at me.\n\nTwo things: 1) The toddler’s mother did not give a shit. She was sitting like two metres away on the phone and when I brought the crying toddler to her, she laughed it off and said the whole being pinned to the floor by a dog that was barking in its face thing was ‘character building’ for the kid. Uh, no, actually. I should know.\n\n2) I told the dog’s owner to keep a better eye on her dog, and that kid could have got hurt, and she told me “if you don’t want to encounter dogs, don’t go to the park.” (This was next to a river and dogs had to be on a leash, actually) and also “she’s friendly and she won’t bite it’s no big deal” and also “stop complaining, you’re making the park a negative experience for my little princess (the dog) and you’ll make her upset if she isn’t allowed to do what she wants (pin random toddlers to the ground, apparently.). That’s traumatising. Imagine if I didn’t let YOU run around! (????? Ma’am I am not a dog)”\n\nI looked to the side and the dog was trying to steal a nearby family’s picnic. \n\nAnyway, don’t be like that dog owner. Or that mum, actually. Wtf??",
