You can easily start with something very small, like:\n\nHelping an elderly cross the street.\n\nBuying lunch for a hungry person.\n\nReaching out to a friend in need and offering your help.\n\nThese are all caring behaviours that are easy for you and can make someone’s day.\n\nAnd more importantly, these altruistic behaviours can make the world a much (much) better place during April Fools’ Day.\n\nWith Health,\n\nSo & So Company\n\nP.S.

There's a grieving process involved with accepting that yet another person has just received (for free!) the one thing you want desperately and can't have. Announcing a fake pregnancy puts that person through this emotional roller coaster, for nothing, and its only worse when they find out it's not real. Then it feels like people are making light of that person's struggles. All Im saying is, you have no idea who in your social circle is dealing with infertility, miscarriage, or stillbirth, because a lot of people are silent about their struggle.

He doesn't drink Dr. Pepper, so he would have known immediately that it wasn't his. \n\nNext day, he didn't say a word, just tossed it.

Every day I hear him asking anyone if they knew what the deal was? He thinks it's funny, but doesn't really understand it. Well this has gone on for 3 weeks. Every day, a new can. A couple times, I've done it twice in one day. I retrieve the discarded can and just fill it up halfway with water and put it in the same spot. The addition of water has really thrown him through a loop. \n\nWell, this week, I haven't done it at all, but I've been saving the cans. I'm hoping he kinda forgets about it. By Friday, conveniently April 1st, I will leave all 5 cans from this week on his desk at the same time.\n\nIt's the dumbest thing I've ever done and it was born out of an accident, but it has been really fun sneaking around and hearing him walk around trying to figure out who is doing it.",

            "text": "Best April Fools Prank was in middle school. Two girls got school early and convinced the teachers to line up a bunch of chairs in the main hallway outside of the middle school homerooms. The teachers told us to go put our stuff in our lockers and sit down and not say anything. When the school day officially started they kept telling us \"you know what you all did so whose gonna fess up?\" \n\nI was so scared but when I looked across from me I saw the two girls across from me barley holding their laughter in and I thought \"how can you laugh at a time like this?\" After a minute of two the teachers finally said April Fools and gave credit to the two girls. Major to respect to them for going all in like that",
