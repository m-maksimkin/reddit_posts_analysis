Just because something is a good reason to stay healthy and stay active doesn't mean it's a good motivator for some people wanting to look attractive is enough. For others, being healthy when you're older is enough of a motivator, but for a lot of people that's not enough to make them want to get up and do something. Maybe a group activity is more motivating or spending time with your family or significant other. Maybe just turning it into a game is what's going to make it work. The real pro tip isn't to come up with a long list of reasons to want to do something. It's to go out and find the one reason that makes you actually want to do it.",

Ditch red meat - No pork or beef - Its bad for the the heart and circulation. Its bad for your heart as well. Go for white meat. Still harmful, just not as much.\n2. Learn what herbs, spices, and vitamins are good for you! Turmeric is good for circulation and the mind while fish oil capsules or just eating fish is good for you. Spicy foods are good as well just dont make it to spicy.\n3. Just get out and walk. If you have to play pokemon go to get out, do it. Get a fitness video game. Dont listen to anyone that trashes those. If they work for you, great, use it!\n4. The best time to get fit and stay fit was when you were younger. The next best time is today.\n5.

As things progressed, I started walking little farther and began some light weightlifting in the the basement.  In about a year or so, I lost 65 lbs, went from a tight 36” waste to a loose 32”.  I have since retired and now walk 6 miles, 5 mornings a week (rain, snow, sub-zero temps, never miss a day) and lift weights for 40 minutes.  I also do about 400 sit-ups with a 10 lb weight on my chest (25 at a time between sets) and a 3-1/2 minute plank (this is the most painful part of my routine).  I don’t push myself too hard and rarely break a sweat.  I also eat whatever I want, but only two meals a day (and no snacking).  I have never felt better and I’m probably now in the best shape of my life.  I was not highly motivated to do this, it just sort of happened organically during the lockdown.  My motivation came as I began to see results and felt better and better as time went on.  Now my wife and I look forward to an active retirement - hiking, kayaking, skiing, etc.  We both worked hard in our careers and now we’re hoping to enjoy time we have left!

You're going to look about how you look, give or take a little bulk, so don't think bigger biceps are suddenly going to make you look attractive if you;re not already about as attractive as you're gonna be if you don't dress like a hobo.  Second, all your muscle building is worthless. You;ll one day just look oversized and old anyway. Nothing worse than former swole people who just look like oversize droopy bears later on. Third, you are going to get old eventually no matter what you do. Too bad. Wasting time and money in a gym won't prevent it. So... OP is not offering any great LPT. You can be healthy just by normal exercise like walking, riding a bike, or playing basketball at the park.  and its free.  All the time you spend exercising trying to prevent aging won't work.  Instead, the real LPT is spend your time and energy on something lasting and worthwhile that will still be a fun hobby when you're in your older years. Or do something lasting that will preserve your legacy and make the world a better place. Most exercise nuts come off as looks and self-obsessed narcissists and nobody cares that they look like the michelin man a tiny bit more. Thinking people care that you flex and like to show your biceps in your dumb tank tops and think it helps you flirt with females... it's just dumb to most people who don't care. So you have more meat on you. They think you are probably looking for a fight because you have insecurity deep down about your masculinity. You can walk around showing others your extra meat as if that makes you a real man, and you can swagger and be pushy too if you want, the way you always fantasized that people would respect you. except they don't respect you, they just fear you're some kind of meathead so they give you the wide berth. You may think that's respect but it's just avoidance. It may get you less people pushing you around or something but most people aren't going to push you around anyway, so what... the king of the bars you visit. But... bars are a shitty place to be a king of anyway. Many gym rate swole types are the same type that thinks people are impressed and envious of their jacked up truck with the plastic nuts hanging from the trailer hitch. Yea, you are really striking a blow against the jealous normies of the world, ha ha. They just envy you, so no wonder you feel your life is not insignificant!  It certainly isn't betraying your insecurities, no not at all.  Being fairly healthy is fine, go ahead and live long enough to enjoy life.  Go ahead and don't get fat to the degree your significant other loses interest in your lovemaking. even titillate them a little sometimes with your attractive looks, sure, that's fine. But, the truth is, long life is overrated. Most of your health and longetivity in life span are genetic and so huffing a puffing so that you;ll somehow be healthy when you're older is a worthless endeavor and a risky bet with your time. Anyway,  do you really want to be 90 and extending the years in which you are feeble, boring, go to funerals all the time, and waste considerable money on healthcare and horrible hospital visits.  If being healthy could extend my 20s for two more decades, sure. But.. extend my 80s or 90s? You've got to be kidding, that only extends the suffering and indignities of old age. No thanks. I'm gonna eat what I want, use my time and money wisely, and miss me with all your stupid health stuff. I aint overweight and I don't do more than occasional walking in the park. I don't care about dumb muscles and I have several more hours in the day to read, write, and enjoy better hobbies than huffing, puffing, and being a masochist enduring unecessary pain just so I can look at myself in the mirror. LOL, you do you boo but it's not for me.",

Add I stopped sports and though I suck, I always did them, I enjoy them.\n\nSlowly slowly over time I had put on an easy 30kg (67 pounds for our American friends). I went from 122kg (269 pounds) to 87kg (191 pounds), then back up to 111kg (244 pounds) and continued similar cycles for a long time.\n\nThen I started to look and control macros and calories. Seriously, if you are unsure just start. Now I can shape my body with ease and slight tweaks. At the moment I am getting bigger bulky muscles cause I want to get stronger. Strength is my goal. In about 5 weeks I will slightly drop my calories and adjust macros and over the next 2 months I will go from a solid 99kg (218) to 93kg (205) while still keeping that strength, or close to it.\n\nFor those looking at starting go to IIFYM.com and use the macro calculator. Gives you your calorie and protein split. Get MyFitnessPal and configure your macros. Now you have your goal and a tracker, you don’t even need a gym, just this. Stay away from any special diet. Things get fancy names like intermittent fasting (IF) works great BUT it is just Calorie Defeicet, who knew skipping a meal means less calories. \n\nOnly look at your week tracker and balance it out, drop calories if you go over. A good tip is start your week on a Friday. Why? You eat like a bastard on the weekend, you may blow calories and just need to eat sushi for a few days and your week will balance out. Like beer? Huge calories switch to vodka or Bacardi. My go to is vodka, lime and soda. 4 of these = less than one beer.\n\nOh you want to follow someone- look at people like jamessmithpt, Shona virtue these are real good honest people.\n\nAnd finally find a sport you love. Really. Try 20 but you will find something. If you love it, it is not a Chore. You WANT to do it. I do BJJ 4 nights a week, gym 3 days a week. I enjoy both. Find yours. Hiking, indoor rock climbing, park walk, kayak, bee keeping, etc. \n\nI am unclewombie and thanks for reading my TED talk :)",

Because I started from a place of not being very active/muscular, I lost what little I had very quickly and started having all kinds of issues that I didn’t have before -back, hips, shoulders, knees, etc. Rehab that should’ve taken a month or so ended up lasting almost a year.\n\nYou lose around 12% of your muscle in a week of bedrest and within just a few weeks you lose about half. Don’t assume that you only need to get fit before you get old. Think of exercise like physical insurance. You hope you won’t need it soon, but if anything happens you’ll be glad you invested in a good policy.\n\n\nEdit: If you can do [this](https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hypermobile_(double_jointed)_thumb_reaches_forearm_backwards.JPG) with your thumb, this advice goes double for you.

Decades of pleading with her to eat better, go for walks or anything to help shed some unnecessary pounds. She was in constant aches and pains and only recently has she gotten the motivation to eat better because of diabetes related issues. Guess who the fuck is telling me how better she feels and how her joints don't hurt anymore yada yada yada. It's fucking irritating as hell to listen to these ignorant ass people talk about being healthy when they are at deaths door. If you can't walk uphill for a minute without almost dying you aren't healthy. If you choose the elevator because stairs would damn near kill you, you aren't healthy.
