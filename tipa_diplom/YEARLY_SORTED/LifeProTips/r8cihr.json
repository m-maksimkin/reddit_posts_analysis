Quit giving up free labor when your employer should be hiring more help and paying more.\nThere are always exceptions and expectations, but in the current US labor situation your employer loves to see salaried employees stay to make up the missing labor.

There was one for the union employees due to all the special rules and the one I did was for \"staff\" employees. We are paid current semimonthly but part time and overtime pay is paid in arrears. It's the most frustrating system ever. I don't work in payroll anymore but I tried like hell to switch everyone to bi weekly arrears instead. It would have made everything so much easier.

But we're paid current semi monthly which means our paycheck on the 15th is for the 1st-15th. But it has to be submitted by the 12th. So we have to hope that no one has any unpaid leave during those three days.

I had expressed concern about the situation but it wasn’t taken seriously at the time. \n\nIn comes COVID, schools get closed early on and during the lockdowns, I have two young kids, one of which is in primary and grade 1 during COVID. \n\nThis is fine for a while, as construction also has a big slow down early on. Fast forward a year though and the next lockdown construction season is booming due to the federal government pouring a ton of money into our provincial government. The support staff in the office are overwhelmed, and I end up absorbing some of their accounting and project bidding functions with a promise of a plan for new staff to handle those functions eventually, until then “just get it done”. \n\nFast forward to early this year and lockdown 3 hits. School is closed, there’s no relief plan for the extra work I had, work is busy, and I’m working until 9pm every night trying to keep up with everything. After the first week I called the owner and told them I wasn’t interested in doing this anymore, “Just get it done”. That hurt a lot, I spent half my life working for that company, and it was no fun. I made the choice to not say fuckit, I had a client facing job, and knew that if I just bailed my reputation would suffer and I’d be stuck there forever, so I just got it done, for months. My mental health began to suffer, I’d never really dealt with mental health issues before, but I was a mess emotionally trying keep all the plates spinning (with mixed success).\n\nOne day I get a phone call from a competitor, and we end up sitting down for a coffee. I get a job offer, it’s a promotion and a significant pay bump. I accept it as soon as I can. \n\nWhen I hand in my resignation, they didn’t even ask why, they knew things were a mess but didn’t ever think they’d have to deal with the consequences. They offer to match the money (a 40% increase) and I tell them it’s not about the money. \n\nI get a couple weeks between jobs, so I enjoy my time with my kids, and try to unwind before jumping back in. I had a company phone before that I had turned in, so things were pretty quiet for a day or two, but as word got around I had left, I had dozens of former customers reach out via various social media platforms. I start work and a sizeable 70% of my clientele eventually follows me over. My new employer is ecstatic, and are constantly trying to fix bottlenecks, which is very refreshing. Clients are happy. I’m finally happy at work again.\n\nI’d like to restate that you probably don’t want to do this, I have (had) a client facing, very social job, where your reputation means something.

Thing is if it showed up after like 50 minutes then I'd still be on the hook to unload and that could take forever.\n\nThe company itself seems alright and the candians that came to the facility periodically to make sure things were going right were very friendly.

Sure my base salary is bigger than the operators but with the overtime they stacked up, it's more than my base salary.
