Be careful.\n\nI'd go further: avoid speaking negatively about anyone - note the negative behaviour and accept it, and take constructive action. If you manager is insane or colleagues problematic, you should be looking actively in the market for jobs, seeing what is out there, having an up to date CV. Never assume you're in a job for life, or that people won't turn on you. You should always be looking and putting the feelers out. Lateral salary increases and  promotions are oft easier than internal.\n\nOnce you verbalise your negative feelings, you start making them more real and people can pick up on your body language and what you say and what you don't.\n\nLike when you're in a relationship, and you ask for relationship advice from your friends when you're mad at your boy or girlfriend and frame your partner as wrong etc., friends will take your side and may even advise to dump. Even if you get through x argument, the friends forever judge the dude and then he comes up negatively thereafter which impacts how he or she gets on with them and what they say to you.\n\nMaybe I've been in some sharp workplaces, but there's nothing positive you can get from negative talk.",

Then I developed depression, work performance slipped, mom got breast cancer, and I requested a sabbatical to get better and spend time with my mom...they responded by firing me. And this was after months before when they told me they'd do whatever I needed to help me get better.\n\nSince its illegal to fire someone with depression like that I am pretty sure they got around it by using my own admittance that I stopped taking my meds as a way to be like \"look he stopped seeking help so we can fire him\" and yet that medication did absolutely nothing for me and I wanted to try a new one and also isn't asking for a sabbatical to get better seeking help? Whole situation was fucked up and really soured me on the working world in general.

Otherwise I didn't talk to anyone beyond a \"Morning!\" a \"See ya!\" and strictly work related things. I didn't even have any personal things on my desk to avoid personal conversation. I'd bend over backwards to help my co-workers, but I never socialized. I never participated in department events like birthdays or potlucks. I asked to be left out of the desk decorating on birthdays and told them they could have cake on my birthday month but they didn't need to know the day. When I took Paternity leave nobody but my boss and my friend knew about it, so I vanished one day for three months and nobody knew why. Hell, they didn't know I was married until one of the hens noticed my ring and started pecking me for info I didn't provide besides confirming I was married.  \n\n\nBasically I was a ghost when it came to socializing at work. This was by design.  \n\n\nWhy? Because I worked with the nosiest and most overly sensitive people I've ever encountered outside the internet. If you said good morning to person 1 and good morning to person 2 but said it in a different tone then person 1 would run to their little clique to talk shit. Any event was a chance for my co-workers to just stop working for the whole day, regardless of how much work there was to do. And every single one of them, sans my friend, thought they were the best employee.  \n\n\nMy work attitude saved my ass multiple times. A coworker I'll call Kelly, since that was her name, decided I wasn't working at all and she had to do all my work. So she and her little posse got together and blew up the non-issue until they were all just enraged at me for not working. And then they made a formal complaint as a group against me for messing around and badmouthing them all.  \n\n\nThere was a couple problems with their story.  \n\n\n1. I never talked about anyone, and barely talked TO anyone.\n2. I had been there longer than any of them and never had a complaint against me besides that I was unfriendly. (I wasn't, if it was work related I'd help without complaint)\n3. We had x amount of accounts to create daily. It was around 30. It was super easy, mindless, data entry and could be knocked out in 2 hours if you didn't spend your day socializing, so I'd do about 40-50 and then fuck around quietly at my desk for the rest of the day. Management did not care about anything you did as long as you got your accounts entered by the end of the day.\n4. The posse actually failed, daily, to meet the goals and never got punished because the manager sucked at noticing anything, they made big deals of how hard it was when it was noticed, and I'm not a snitch for things like that.\n\nSo this big to do was started, an investigation was opened and what was found? I didn't do anything, I was exceeding the bare minimum effort (putting me head and shoulders above them) and they were severely lacking in their numbers. They got in trouble, nothing happened to me, and life went on.  \n\n\nSo, a tip I always told new hires was to just do your work and go home, because that was drama that wasn't needed.   \n\n\nSo I agree with this LPT. Just go do work and go home, co-workers (with some exceptions) are not your friends and will toss you under a bus for no reason.",

What ended up happening was that nobody would talk to me unless I initiated conversation, or I would have to butt into another convo.\n\nBut when I did flooring and stairs nobody gossiped or had anything bad to say about a coworker sometimes there would be disputes but it would always be face to face, like john would tell me quincy fucked up a couple of floorboards and he's made a mess and then call quincy over to tell him the same thing.\n\nAnd ofcourse I think gossiping is bad but if you are less confrontational or are afraid someone will take what you say the wrong way you still have to vent and if you don't have friends or family, coworkers are okay to gossip to because otherwise you're complaining to higher ups and they might see your minor complaints as real actionable things and now you've fucked over your coworker for something that you will forgive and forget in a day.",

They started to see what I was talking about but didn't seem to get the full extent of the situation. The biggest issue was our bosses were experts in subject matter A and we were experts in subjact matter B. He'd give a B reason why they couldn't do something and they didn't know enough to refute him, where even a novice could find a work around.\n\nSo I straight up started shitting on the guy whenever possible so they'd get the memo. I never made anything up, I never exaggerated. But they'd say something like \"We'll have him do X on dayshift.\" and I'd reply with \"cool, I'll come in on swings ready to get started on X.\"\n\nA few of them really started to see the issue more clearly as my predictions proved true over and over. Finally one day I'm sitting in the office. It was 90°+ I was wearing my jacket and shivering. I was sick as fuck. But it was friday and we had to finish a big job or it would completely fuck the whole next week. The dock chief (equivalent rank and position to shitty supervisor) noticed and asked why I didn't go to sick call. I explained I was the only one capable of doing the job as there were 3 of us, Me, a guy who was occupied getting ready for deployment (top priority), and my boss. If I left \"There'd be no one to do it.\"  They called in my boss and told him they were sending me to sick call and asked who would be available to do the job. He said the guy who was busy packing for deployment could do it. Then was told that wasn't possible. He stood there in silence for a solid minute pondering who could do the job before the dock chief pointed out he could and told me to go.\n\nCame in on monday and nothing had been touched.\n\nEventually he left for deployment and I confirmed that I wouldn't be reenlisting. Faced with the prospect of their lead for our shop being actively detrimental for the job. They got a Master Sergeant to replace me. A Senior airmen. An E4 replaced by an E7 so they could get his E6 boss to do his god damned job. He showed up and I trained him up on how our specific operations went. Told him about my bosses habits.
