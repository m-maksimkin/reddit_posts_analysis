    "LPT: When a pet has a mid to late-stage terminal illness, don't go through brutal and extraordinary measures to extend it's life too long. Especially cats. They cannot tell you they are suffering. Yes, we want more time with them. But not if they are hurting.\nOur 2 senior cats died a few months apart during the quarantine.  The 1st had cancer.  And we extended his life by 1 year through chemo and monthly vet visits.  This included an endoscopy, and being poked and prodded by needles every few weeks.  He was skinny, vomited often, and had no energy.  But we thought it was okay because his loving personality was still there.  He died gasping, not being able to breathe.  **Immediate** regrets.\n\nOur 2nd cat had kidney failure.  Daily IV fluids at home, pills twice per day.  Became super skinny.  She developed pancreatitis which is apparently (to humans) so painful that people are hospitalised as the only treatment.  We did not know until it became very obvious.  Ran her to the vet.  Figured she'd be back in a week and we can keep giving her IV's to extend her life at home.\n\nShe died gasping at the vet.  We made it just in time to say goodbye (vet called, drove there at 4am, held her as she passed).\n\nIt took 2 lessons, but now I know that **extending a pet's life by extraordinary means is selfish on our part, when they have a mid to late stage terminal illness**.  We just want more time with them.  But we may be causing them pain without realizing it.  \n\nIf I could go back in time, I would have called the vet to our home so our cats could pass peacefully here, with no pain, and no fear.  Their lives would have been slightly shorter by a few months.  But if I have to suffer pain and invasive medical procedures for the last year of my life...  I would rather not live that year.": [

It's one thing to not put an old cat through surgeries and discomfort to give them an extra year of pain where they have no joy. It's another to kill an 8 year old cat that is otherwise fine and has more good days than bad because you either don't wanna pay for their bills or have this fucked up notion that you have to put them down the second anything is wrong. \n\nMy cat is a kidney cat. He goes to the vet twice a week for fluid shots. He doesn't like it much. He also vomits often (always has) and has constipation issues. \n\nBut know what? He loves life. He loves being outside in the backyard with me. He loves chicken. He loves cuddles. He makes me play with him in his favorite room every day. He's happy. If I can help him have that joy longer but have to make him take his medicine, that's worth it. \n\nYou know more than they do. All they want is love and food. If those things stop mattering to them and the sickness is terminal, that's one thing.  But if it's terminal and they aren't hiding, or irritable, or starving themselves then they're fine.

So I put two and two together and got him in.\n\nVery severe bladder infection.  My vets were so amazing and thank goodness for them because I was in shock with everything being so sudden but it occured to me that this wasn't sudden at all and he must have been suffering for quite some time without us even caring.  AND I started noticing all these signs in hindsight.  He had been soooo much more cuddly lately.  It's because he was in pain.\n\nI did make the decision to put him down that day but I've been feeling so guilty about how we failed him.  At least his suffering came to an end but even that gives a lot of guilt.  If I had had the amount of money needed I might have had him treated even with the vet telling me how stressful recovery time would be for him.  I think I should accept the guilt of not noticing sooner, instead of not having the money for the treatment because I would have only put him through more pain prolonging something that had a good chance of coming back.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry for your losses.

Each scale is from 0 (or 1) to 10, where 10 is perfect, and 0/1 is not working at all.  When you hit a total of 35 (out of 70), it's time to consider saying goodbye.  Lovey had been diagnosed with a malignant cancer, but when the (large) dog is 15, it's questionable whether any therapy (beyond pain mgmt) would have added any quality lifespan.  (As it was, she managed to stick around for another 7 months of good quality life.)\n\nUp until her last couple days, she was around 50 or so on the scale.  She needed help most of the time getting up, but once she was up she could walk around easily, although she'd need help up and down the stair to get out.  Accidents were rare, and she ate everything offered to her.  Walks were getting shorter, but she still liked a good stroll.\n\nBut when she crashed (no bowel control, no appetite, and just looking miserable), she crashed hard.  We monitored her on Tuesday for any improvement, and Tuesday night she had other accidents, and mostly refused to come inside without a lot of cajoling.

He was severely attached to the dog, and as a man of pride he had a real hard time saying goodbye. At the same time, the dogs condition got exponentially worse as the cancer went metastatic to the bone. \n\nIt was because of what I witnessed did I learn what you did, but it’s worth sharing that the trauma is still there and acting swiftly sometimes doesn’t make much difference. My dog passed in November as she was overwhelmed by arthritis in her lower back. Her condition was deemed worthy of painkillers as I immediately checked in with the vet again about her declining condition. Still didn’t take more than a few days to see that the threshold of discomfort reached a point of no return, and the final days was awful up until she passed comfortably in my embrace on the floor of the office as the vet put her down. As memorable my experience was and am glad the suffering wasn’t prolonged, I vividly remember how awful the final days were - to the point that merely standing on her hind legs prompted a shrieking reaction like nothing I’ve ever heard in my 12 years with her, and the only way she could relieve herself was by me applying pressure to her bladder as instructed by the vet. \n\nAll of which to say, the final days of the experience was only a mere fraction of the entire life of enjoyment she had with our family. Personally, I’m best able to grieve when I realize that death is a necessary, but small, part of the enriching process of caring for our animal companions. But it’s really fucking difficult nonetheless.\n\nPlease take care, I hope you find peace.",

I spent the first 6 hours treating her because she had fleas, lots of them; so many that it took me all this 6 hour to get rid of them. I fell in love with her so fast...\n\nBut some 4 months later, when she was still super small and just a baby that could still not jump much, I came home to her acting weird. She was for two hours in the same spot, under the sofa, not moving, now meowing... I tried to see what was going on, but she would act almost normal everytime I actually tried to play with her or anything, so I thought she was just scared of something (proably the other cat we had, as she was elder and they had a kind of a fight two days prior). Anyway, I thought she'd come out, and went to do some stuff.\n\nSome hopurs later, my bf came home, and when I went to say hello to him, I saw her in the same spot. I was worried now. She hadan't moved at all, sitting in the exact same position I left her.\n\nWhen I took her, her head was shaking.\n\nWe rushed to the vet, I didn't even grab her case, just took her in my hands, close to my body.\n\nThe vet (which is super close to my house) told me she proabbly had Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIPV) which is casused by the Feline Coronavirus (FCoV, not the human one, just another coronavirus type). I didn't even know about it, but she told me it was serious and, if we wanted to treat her, she needed a hospital, so we took the car and went to the closest vet hospital.\n\nThey tested her there, she was positive and by then the bet told us. They could try to treat her symptoms, but she already had neurologic symptoms (the head shaking) and chances, even before that were super low, as she had never seen any cat survive the FIPV (lots of cats have the FCoV, but usually they never develop the FIPV and just have mild diarrhea, but when it mutates to FIV, it becomes fatal).\n\nWe thought about trying \"everything\" (there's actually no treatment for it, so we knew that it was just denial), but 15 minutes later, we gave up and asked the vet to put her down.

In my experience, the emergency vet I dealt with pushed me into taking extraordinary measures to prolong my cat's life because she knew I was vulnerable and would do it. \n\nI adopted an FeLV positive kitty named Maddie in December 2016. I was hesitant since she was my first ever cat and had a known illness. I never knew how much time I would get with her as cats with this virus can take a turn any time. When she finally started going downhill about a year later, my local vet told me straight and said that she was at the end of her life and was no longer producing red blood cells, meaning she was severely anemic. She was also having trouble breathing, going to the bathroom, and wasn't eating.\n\nI wanted a second opinion, so I took her to a different vet who told me my cat \"seemed like she had so much life left to live\" and I should \"give her a chance\". So I had this vet give Maddie a blood transfusion even though in my head I knew she wouldn't be able to produce her own red cells. When I brought her home, I needed to give her oral medications which would stress her and since she already was having trouble breathing, she would start to hyperventilate. The vet also told me she shouldn't be allowed to jump on anything or move around much because exerting too much energy would only exacerbate symptoms of anemia. \n\nI finally came to my senses and decided this was no life for a cat and as much as it killed me, I decided to put her to rest. I knew I should have done so earlier and I hate that vet to this day for preying on my sadness to make a few extra bucks.",

            "text": "I had this happen in January. I had a cat, Boo, who I'd adopted in 2008. He was a big grey and white boy with quite long hair, a big puffy tail and itty-bitty legs. The leading theory was that he was a mix between a Mainecoon and a munchkin. \n\nHe developed some bowel issues probably about 5 or 6 years ago and through some vet treatment, change of diet and lots of care and treatment at home he was doing quite well and seemed to be on the road to recovery. One night in January, about 3am or so, my wife got out of bed and stepped in something wet, turned out to be cat pee and Boo was just curled up in his spot, sitting in it. Not a sound of complaint, but absolutely not a good sign.\n\nSo I picked him up, ran a bath and cleaned him up, and decided to take him to the 24 hour emergency vet about a half hour away. The drive up was longer than usual because of a snow storm, but Boo didn't complain at all, which was another bad sign, since usually he was afraid of being in the car and was a fairly skittish and neurotic cat anyway, except with me, so I was already fairly certain I knew what was going to happen.\n\nGot to the vet and, due to covid protocols, I had to take him to the front door where they took him inside and I had to wait in the car. I was there for four hours waiting for them to finish looking him over and they called twice to okay some x-rays and other stuff. In the end it was what I'd feared. His problem had led to distention in the bowel which meant there was no option to help him now but surgery and that was no guarantee it wouldn't happen again. It would cost around $3,000.\n\nI knew at that moment I wouldn't be leaving with him. The money wasn't an issue, I would have happily spent it if I knew he'd be fine and would get a few more years, but to put him through the long, frightening vet stay, the pain of surgery and recovery, and not even know if he'd be okay after, I couldn't do it.\n\nHe would have been 14 this November. Now he has a little stone with his name and picture on it under some trees in my back yard.\n\nFun trivia, while I was waiting at the vet, around 6am I got a call to say my aunt had died. January was great this year.",

I thought, she must have already been suffering a lot to get to that point. The decision to put her to her final sleep was easy but very agonizing for me. I sobbed that entire day and probably that whole week. I got to say goodbye to her and was there holding her as she was given the injection and took her last breath. I sobbed on the way out of the vet's office and I just know some of the people in the waiting room knew what had happened. \n\nI had fostered Iris and her two sisters Rose and Lily when they were barely out of needing to be bottle fed. I had to mix their wet food with kitten milk formula and water so they'd be able to eat it.

I had her for 3 years before I laid her to sleep. \n\nThat was the most traumatic thing I've experienced so far in my life. And I'm still not over it. I cry any time I think of her (I'm crying right now, actually), seeing iris flowers anywhere makes me think of her. It's been 5 years since then and I have not gotten another cat. I'm probably never going to get another cat unless I end up living alone.\n\nAnd you know the worst part of the aftermath? My mom blames me cause I wasn't there. I blame my mom cause she never told me Iris was sick, losing weight, and not grooming herself, and because she didn't take Iris to the vet that entire time. \n\nI have her ashes in a box on one of my bookshelves, where I can see her every day.",

There's no (accessible) treatments for it that would have provided any meaningful change in his quality of life, but we still had him long enough for his second birthday.

The day before we brought him to the vet, he had basically nibbled on his food and that was about the time I realized that keeping him around any longer was unfair to him.\n\nHis personality never really changed, just his energy level. There were two things that broke my heart the most. Before he got sick, he would almost always greet me by standing on his back legs and head butting my hand, even when his energy was getting really low he still tried his hardest to do it.\n\nThe worst though, was the one time I watched him eye one of his old, favorite spots: a really high windowsill. I saw him stare at it for a while, ready a jump, and then he probably realized he couldn't make it and turned around and walked away.\n\nI miss that little guy so fucking much, he used to love being held for 20+ minutes at a time, was always the loudest little shit when it was dinner time.

I worked for many years in vet care as well as with a well known at-home euthanasia service and I cannot stress enough how much better it generally is for both the pet and the family for so many reasons. \n\nAlso, there’s no perfect time to elect for euthanasia but there is a reasonable window within which it is perfectly acceptable to make the decision to euthanize. A vet worth anything isn’t going to agree to a euthanasia before this window is open and while there’s not really a “too soon” if the window is open, I’ve witnessed so many that were arguably too late. Better a day too soon than a minute too late we often told clients who were struggling with letting go. A pet diagnosed with a terminal illness, regardless of symptom management or treatment options available or prognosis for time left, is in this window. \n\nIf you’re still unsure keep a daily journal/checklist for the most important things; did your pet eat and drink ok that day? Did they seem interested in playing/walking? Did they have noticeable trouble getting around? Are there chronic health issues to consider? If the answers to these show more “bad” days than “good” ones, you’re well within that window. Use scales 1-10. Be honest and objective. \n\nMany folks don’t want to see their pets suffer but think a “natural” death is the best option and while I completely understand their reasoning, the reality is that a natural death is often slow, painful, and difficult to watch. \n\nSocietally we do a really good job of insulating ourselves from death and pets are really no exception. I don’t blame anyone for struggling with this decision and can’t recommend enough the compassionate folks who do at-home euthanasia services. They genuinely want to help you and your pet and will happily help talk your through any concerns. \n\nYou are not a bad person for choosing a quick and painless death for your furry friends in order to prevent their additional suffering nor are you a bad person for learning this lesson the hard way.

I kept asking if it would fix him or just extend his life by a few days/weeks. She wouldn’t give me a straight answer and I had the gut feeling they were just trying to make more money off of me. I knew he was in so much pain and suffering but no one was validating my decision that he needed to be put down. I never stopped feeling like I didn’t do enough even though I’d been giving him different medicines and taking him in for fluid for a couple weeks at that point.

I declined these options as his age was advanced and I didn’t want him to be sick.  \n\nRadiation went over without a hitch.  He didn’t miss a meal after and had no skin burning.

My wife convinced me to get him, I always loved cats, grew up with them, but in a small apartment I was worried about my allergies. That little gray and white derp taught me how to take care of myself again, because I had to take care of him. He loved me unconditionally, he just wanted to be where I was. Fast forward 3 years, we have a daughter and moved into a new house outside the city. Sealy loved our yard, would come galloping whenever you called him, just the happiest cat. Until he wasn’t. He had a seizure after acting weird for a couple weeks, but the blood work came back clean. It wasn’t until he had a seizure while laying on my chest that we knew something was really wrong. Took him to our vet—who saw him free of charge on his day off, the man was a saint who sadly died of COVID last year—who said it’s clearly something neurological, off to the vet neurologist we went. They thought it was epilepsy, prescribed meds, took our boy home and he seemed to be doing better. Brought his bed into our room so we could keep an eye on him, and when I woke up in the middle of the night he wasn’t in his bed. I thought he was feeling better. Went to the bathroom and there he was, collapsed on the floor unable to move or get up. I’m not even sure if he was conscious at that point. Vet had told us to keep an eye out for high temperature, so we took his temp and it was super low. He was likely already nearly dead. Wife called the vet as I silently panicked. We grabbed our daughter and hopped in the car to head to the vet ER, Sealy died on the way there. I still remember keeping my hand on him in the passenger seat as we drove, talking to him, until my wife said, “Voz, I think he’s gone.” Pulled over and sobbed. Just. Sobbed. Full-on ugly crying. Buried him in our backyard the next day. I wish I could have had the chance to say goodbye. Much, much, much love to all of you who have lost companion animals.

I’ll agree with this completely if it’s something late stage as you experienced, where it’s being extended extraordinarily, yes it’s a hard process but the best choice. \n\nBUT. I shall add my own experience with this and say: judge for yourself. Sometimes this isn’t the case. Every pet’s situation is different and **enjoy your time with them as much as you can no matter what.**\n\nI have lost 2 dogs to terminal illness throughout my life. One to cardiomyopathy/lymphoma and one with lymphoma. Then we tragically lost a puppy that choked on her own vomit in her sleep. It’s a horrendous thing to go through, and I’ve eventually come to peace with myself about it. They did not suffer till the very end. I’ll never regret the money and worry that was spent to have more time with them. \n\nWe now have 2 dogs; a boxer that was abandoned by his family and was in a shelter for half his life (7yr) and the bulldog mother to the puppy we lost (3yr). They are the lights of my life. \n\nIn a hard way, we found out that the boxer was showing signs of heart failure. Turns out that he as well was given a diagnosis of boxer cardiomyopathy. It tore me apart. He’s a dog that after a year of finally finding a family, was cursed with an awful disease and would lose that paradise he was given. I was terrified, and was prepared for the worst from my trauma. \n\nHowever, somehow our amazing vet found a way to get us in with a top tier vet cardiologist an hour away and we rushed him. I didn’t want him to suffer and was too emotional to comprehend much. Again, I expected the worst, but this time, the worst did not come. \n\nOur boy was granted another chance despite having a terminal disease. He had an arrhythmic attack when he was with the cardiologist, which was the key for having the cardiologist to figure out the amount of medicine he needed. We ended up leaving with our drugged up boy at 4am and was able to bring him home, which I did not expect. He was accepted as a case study, which brought access to other heart medicines he takes daily. This was never an option when we had our dog that passed from the same disease, and it is currently what is saving his life. \n\nAlmost 5 months later, our boy is as bright as he was before we found out about his diagnosis. He wanted to live, we wanted him to leave, and we were very close to losing all hope and saying goodbye to him. It’s a dreaded and common disease amongst boxers, but now it is possible to have their lives extended for a much longer time and not be in pain. I’ll take every extra moment I can get. Since I was brought out of the brim of despair alongside my boy, my outlook has changed. \n\nPets and especially dogs have the ability to communicate with their humans and I stand by this. When we had to put down our 2 dogs, they told us. You can tell, they can tell. This time? Our boy despite being in pain, didn’t give that look, and now he’s acting like the amazing dog he’s always been. Might be some inherent bias or forcing myself to believe this, but I just knew it wasn’t his time to go. \n\nThis was very long winded, but my whole point is to say that there is hope in grim situations, to listen to your babies, and especially your vets. When the time comes, it comes. Do what you can while you have the control, even if it’s just an extra day. If you have the chance, take it until it is no longer an option.",

It can be tough on the flip side, but know that you did the right thing. \n\nWe had to make the tough decision to euthanize our 14 yr old cat a few years ago. She was living her best life until one day she stopped eating and drinking. We pampered her all of that week by making sure she didn’t have to go far to use her litter box or over exert herself in any way. An initial sonogram showed some masses in her GI system. We pretty much had accepted it was cancer but had not gotten the final results back. When the next weekend came and she was still very much alive but had not eaten/drank anything, our vet suggested we take her to the ER vets to get fluids to keep her comfortable. At the ER, they noticed she was breathing faster than normal, did a scan, and found fluid in her lungs. We made the tough but necessary decision to euthanize rather than have them remove the fluid with a needle (high chances of the fluid returning, especially given her suspected cancer diagnosis). The expert who later read her scans said it appeared that her GI cancer had metastasized throughout her body. \n\nAlthough adopting an animal friend should mean you are able and willing to go above and beyond to pay for their healthcare, it does not mean prolonging their suffering. I think (and 100% understand why) some people find it hard to differentiate between these two things. I definitely stayed awake at night wondering if we made the right decision, but I always feel 100% validated when I remember when we chose to euthanize our girl, she instantly was at peace. She deserves that. \n\nPS- Big shout out to all the vets and vet techs out there. We also had to unexpectedly euthanize our 10 yr old dog recently and both of my euthanasia experiences with different vets have been sad of course but I could feel the staff’s compassion and I felt my animal friends had the most peaceful experiences possible. I take care of humans for a living and although sickness and death can make me sad, I feel very comfortable providing care for them. But if an animal friend was involved—no way, I’d bawl my eyes out the whole time. Vets, thank you for doing what you do and I’m sorry for the abuse you get from customers.\n\nPSS- Stay with your pet when they are being euthanized. You won’t regret it.

She got older slowly but happily, and despite getting more cripple, she was happy and content.\nShe couldn’t walk that far anymore so we took breaks. I took her to her favourite beach a last time and she pranced and danced and stumbled and we rested more than we walked. She was so happy.\nAfter that she lived another two years. Still ate, still wagged her tail, but had a harder time holding her poop in. Didn’t make it to the bushes to poop quietly anymore. Later she lost some at home, especially at night. She slept more and more, walked less, didn’t play so much anymore. She couldn’t eat kibbles so got soup or mouse, or anything she would be able to slobber.\n\nIt had been her job to make us happy I figured, and this was her retirement. She helped me through harder times, now it was my time to pay back. So she lived a little while longer, shat the place every night and we had to carry her up any stair or ridge.. \n\nAt a certain point my parents were going to their place in another country. It was a long drive and where she previously loved sleeping in the car, she would be whimpering now after a couple of minutes. She couldn’t walk stairs anymore so couldn’t stay with me (3D floor), and anyone else lived to far away.\nSo it would be a practical decision and we talked and talked and talked. And cried \nShe wasn’t that happy anymore. She didn’t do many things she enjoyed, she was very old and lived longer than many other dogs.\n\nAnd than I figured: dogs aren’t made to last this long. In the wild, she wouldn’t have been able to run along with the pack years ago. She would have stumbled, they would have waited for her some times but eventually have left her. She would have caught a couple of rabbits but that would have been it, years ago.\n\nSo her last years were for us, not for her. I was kidding myself by seeing it otherwise.\n\nSo we decided to arrange it. I had to work and raced to the vet afterwards. She was still happy to see me, and wagged her tail to the assistent like usual. The doubts rose, but we had made a decision, this wasn’t a worthy life anymore, even though she could still wag a little.\n\nGod I still miss her, but am very confident that was the right decision and we could have let her die months earlier.",

You can see and face the process of growing older and how eventually the quality of life just isn't there.\n\nMany organizations put out some great info on how to evaluate when the right time is, [here's](https://vet.osu.edu/vmc/sites/default/files/import/assets/pdf/hospital/companionAnimals/HonoringtheBond/HowDoIKnowWhen.pdf) one. \n\nBut here's some of what I've learned over the years, in all of it's idiosyncratic nature.\n\n1. Nobody else can make the decision. It's all on you. This is stressful, but by not making a decision, you are making the decision to do nothing.\n2. Start thinking about it early in the decline period. Prepare yourself, and set up criteria. In general, if an animal can eat and drink and relieve themselves without too much pain, they're probably doing okayish. I will force feed, do subcutaneous fluids, and clean up after them, but only for limited periods of time with the promise that it won't be their new normal. \n3. Make a \"bucket list\" for your animal. This is mostly for you, but the animal should like it too. Remember what your animal can/can't do because of their illness.\n4. Talk to your vet. Try to get them to be candid and frank. Remember, they're used to people who tend to either do too much or too little for their animals, so they'll likely be cagey. They're also trying not to make the decision for you. At the base level, what you need to ask is will X procedure quantitatively and qualitatively improve the animal's life or just extend it. The older an animal is, the less likely treatments will be successful.\n5. They cannot tell you. In general, animals hide pain. They also can't talk or communicate and probably don't even understand the concept of their own death. \n6. BE IN THE ROOM. Mobile euthanasia services are a godsend, but one of my most positive experiences recently was a long drive with my elderly cat to a vet. She sat on my lap in the sunshine, loving every pet, scritch, and sunbeam. Her passing was as peaceful as could be. The last thing any animal wants is to be away from their loved ones while a stranger pokes them.\n7. Euthanasia can be ugly. Be prepared. The vets will do their best to make it painless, but problems can happen. Veins can blow out, elderly animals can not circulate the drugs well and take time. After death, emptying of bowels is not uncommon.\n8. It's okay to grieve.\n9. Other people don't know how to respond to your grief. This is true of grieving a human loved one or an animal loved one. They will probably default to saying something everyone says. Something about taking the rainbow bridge happens a lot know with animals. I don't find that stuff helpful, but know other people mean well. \n10. Keep their memory alive. Put together photos and stories about them. Scrapbook, journal, whatever. Put it down before you forget. I didn't do this, and I am realizing that some of my animal friends are slipping from my memory.",

I made it into yoghurt drops, which I put in the freezer. I gave him one every 12 hours and his appetite returned, he gained weight and started chemo. After one round of chemo, he was acting and looking like his old self again.

We knew this would eventually kill her but we weren't expecting it to be so soon.\n\nShe developed kidney issues the last week. She went from normal to letargic in a couple of days and stopped eating all together at the third. She seemed to be making it through but then her heart just couldn't take it. It didn't just go down but the damage was irreparable. We decided to put her to sleep as she was clearly in pain and scared, not even fighting when the vet took her blood sample. I'm so glad she didn't suffer that long and we were able to have her with us as long as we did. 8 years for me and almost 14 with my wife.\n\nIf anything, had we known this would be the outcome we would have slept her sooner but we really couldn't know the heart was going to choose this moment to give out.

Last week she started acting more lethargic but still doing her business seemingly usual.\n\nThen over the weekend her legs started swelling and she was very noticably more lethargic and she had labored breathing.  Got an emergency appt yesterday morning. She weighed about 10lbs more than normal even though she looked 10lbs lighter. They did blood tests and then X-ray and found fluid pooling in her abdomen and chest. A sample if it shows it was non intravenous blood (non clotting) and the likely cause was a tumor or cancer, which also interferes with lymph drainage causing fluid in the lower extremities. \n\nVet said they could do an ultrasound to confirm the tumor or cancer, but doesn’t make a difference because there really was no treatment option. They could give her steroids to be more active and less pain for another week, but that was about as long as she would have until it would be too difficult for her to breath. \n\nShe didn’t seem in pain, but was suffering. We decided it was time that afternoon. We brought the kids in to say goodbye and my wife and I stayed for final hugs and kisses as they put her to sleep. I think we made the right choice.",

She was a crabby cat, with other issues, and I felt it was merciful to let her go. Also, she really hated pills and needles, and I felt treating the diabetes would make her miserable. The vet answered all of my questions about what treatment would look like. The process of frequent blood draws to determine the right insulin doses would have been torture for this kitty. I knew I could give needles - I gave sub-Q fluids to another cat with kidney failure - and I knew how this cat hated to be touched sometimes. She was a semi-feral rescue cat with a quirky temperament.\n\nI made the mistake of posting about this on Facebook, so many people commented that their friend's cat had diabetes and it responded well to treatment, etc. They kept commenting, even after I posted an update advising that I had chosen euthanization and she was gone. I turned off the privacy of the post saying it was diabetes. \n\nIf it had been one of my other cats - ages 3 years and 1 year - I would have chosen to treat the diabetes. They're young with no health issues. But this old girl was tired and she was very ill. I regret not taking her to the vet earlier. But I don't regret choosing to give her mercy and not try to extend her life.",

He loved to lay right on top of you if you even thought about laying on the couch. My mom had taught him commands like sit, lay down, and zoomies (she tried rollover but he would just get stuck on one side lol). Not too long ago he wasn’t acting like himself… he wouldn’t ride up front of the RV while they were on the road and left wet food in his bowl which is usually his favorite. They went to a vet in one state who prescribed him dog meds without even doing bloodwork… weird. They didn’t give them to him and went to a second opinion. That second opinion was this morning and, unfortunately, they found cancer all over his lungs.\n\nMy parents are so strong, caring, selfless, and empathetic. It was very sudden and unexpected but they did what they knew was right and let him rest. We’re all going to miss this big boy cat who I found in an abandoned and could literally fit in the palm of my hand (I have pics to prove it!)\n\nRIP Toby “Tubs” ❤️ love you forever",

She was abandoned to me and I am dirt poor but I resolved to give her the best life I feasibly could. Especially since she had been through a few owners before me. Anyway, she slowly started showing symptoms of kidney disease. Vet told me she was in kidney failure and I tried everything I could ease her symptoms. Vet couldn’t indicate her timeline, but we had several visits, and then unfortunately my sweet Carmella began to decline very rapidly in the middle of the pandemic (making it hard to have real conversations and accessibility with the vet). \nI thought kidney disease meant I may have years with her but it was starting to look like I’d have just weeks. Maybe I was in denial. But I feared that there was something else making her sicker. I worried about intestinal blockage or a tooth infection. I considered bringing her in for more testing, but I couldn’t afford it. I was already $1500 in debt from her testing and treatments - I couldn’t afford more tests and then I thought at the end of the day, if something is compounding her illness, she still has kidney failure. What if I put her through all these tests in such a state and it turned out to be just acute kidney failure, nothing more? I’d rather have the time with her and say goodbye to her while she is still coherent. Poor baby was eating her litter but nothing else, drooling, would only drink(/chug!) water from the toilet, had developed a sore on her nose, was losing weight by the second, and cried in pain or confusion every night. Letting her go was one of the most difficult decisions I’ve made in my life. If I had the resources, maybe I would have done more testing or treatments. This cat was incredible. And even in her last days she did have those few moments of compassion like you mentioned. \n\nLetting them go “in peace” sounds nice, but it’s a very fine line to decide when is “peace” and when is ensuring you’ve exhausted all options and ensured they’ve lived their full life.

She believed that the 2.5 months extra with him was worth that suffering. \n\nI felt awful for the dog, and realized I just couldn’t do that to my precious cat. So, I learned to say goodbye instead of trying to extend a life so unreasonably. \n\nI’m glad you learned this lesson yourself, it’s good to keep in mind if you plan on having more pets in the future! You don’t want them to suffer... and I’m sure your cats were happy you were there to love them, even with what was going on. Hope you’re doing ok now <3",

(We adopted/saved her from a Cattery when she jumped into our arms as a kitten).\n\nWe only found out when she lost her meow (her name was “meowsy” funnily enough) and got very ill at about 8 months old.  She had a severe infection in her mouth (very common in FIV positive cats).\n\nFortunately, meds got that under control.  We got maybe two more years with her before the infection came back seemingly overnight much worse.\n\nIt would have cost thousands to try and save her, and she was very sick and in obvious suffering.  I made the decision to have her put down and bury her in the back garden.  One of the hardest things I have ever had to do.  I Took her to the vet once we took the girls to school and was very much close to a wreck while she knew what was coming (or seemed to).  \n\nStayed with her when they gave her the shot and patted her until she left us.  I had done the same thing with the family dog when I was growing up, and the sense of betrayal felt the same when they looked into your eyes with fear.\n\nI know I did the right thing, there was no coming back from where she was at without long term suffering and thousands and thousands of dollars we just didn’t, and dont, have.  The vet wouldn’t even adopt her to do the treatment themselves because FIV.\n\n…and then less than a week later our 18 year old beagle ( who we had adopted at 15) had an ear infection and I had to make the same choice because of his age and failing health.   (He had a terrible mouth infection when we got him and the worst breath imaginable even after we pid to have the offending teeth removed AND his hips were shot…his back legs had stopped working for a few days  twice and only came back to life when I carried him out to the car for his final trip to the vet).\nI checked his ears daily because beagle, but was away for work for three days and when I got back he smelled…different to his usual terrible mouth smell.\nAnother vet trip, another ultimate sense of betrayal and guilt, another backyard burial.\n\nOne of the worst weeks of my life.  I know I did the right thing both times, but god does it feel bad to have to make the decision and be there with them while they pass.  Felt like such a bad person that it happened in once let alone twice, but both were on highly borrowed time with non-existent immune systems.",

He's so big, the vet couldn't work on his leg. There was a clinic 3 hours and $3500 away that could do what is called a TPLO surgery, and they performed an absolute miracle on him, but it was probably the worst two weeks of mine and his life as I couldn't let him downstairs in the TV room where everyone hangs out, and the drugs made him loopy. He'd find ways to get around the barricades I set up at the stairwell and somehow make it down without falling or hurting himself, but it terrified me every time he did it. He's old for his breed, and we had advice from my family to just euthanize him...\n\nThe dog I had before him was a pit/Lab mix, and the sweetest girl you could ever hope to meet. She was getting on in age and was getting tumors over her body. I'd have the vet remove them but after a few months they'd come back and we'd do it all over again, but when they came back they were usually bigger and more painful for her. Eventually, she started losing energy. She used to love chasing squirrels and dancing with me but just couldn't do it anymore. Between age, the cancer, and the surgeries it was just burning her down. The last surgery she had was particularly brutal for her and I promised her that would be the last time, and if the cancer came back, no more trips to the vet where she was afraid of everything and that I would take care of her myself. She was tired and it was unfair to keep her in pain.\n\nAfter a couple of months, the tumors returned and I could hear her whining and shivering from the pain.\n\nI kept my promise. She's buried in the back yard where she loved to run around and chase squirrels, right next to the playhouse where she liked to rest in the shade. I had a rock carved with her picture on it to mark the spot. \n\nMy wife is a cat person and we've had a number of cats over the years, only one has died on their own.

We knew there was nothing that could be done. It was hard to let him go, but after spending one more night with him, they took him in.\n\nThen around that same time, our other cat was revealed to have feline infectious peritonitis, which we guess was triggered by the older cat dying (since the two were very close). FIP is fatal, and she wasn't eating well, and was very lethargic. My dad and I knew it would be only a matter of time before we lost her, too, but my mom kept trying treatments for her for several weeks before finally agreeing to put her down as well.\n\nI get it, we were all still reeling from the first cat's death, even with as old as he'd gotten. It was all very sudden all the same, and to lose our other cat so soon afterward would be very tough. But thankfully, my mom was able to be convinced. Recently, her two favorite dogs had to be put down about a year apart from each other (one was 16 with tumors in his lungs, and the other was 17 with canine dementia that had rapidly gotten very severe out of nowhere), but she was much more ready to put them before her own feelings.\n\nHell, I had to go through the same thing a few years back with my cat. She was very sick and lethargic out of nowhere. Took her to the vet, they said her blood was toxic, nothing they could do for her. Made the decision to get her put down that night. It was really hard, and I'd never been in that position to make that decision before, but at least it was over quickly for her.\n\nFrankly, I'd like to be able to have the same done for me if I were suffering with no chance of ever getting better.",

We ended up having to tell them what to do and prescribe.\n\nEdit: if you don't have a lot of time and money I don't have anything against putting down a terminally ill animal, and to the extent that vets don't want you to feel guilty I understand their recommendations. But at some point it seemed like they kept recommending to put him down because they had nothing better to offer due to incompetence.

            "text": "Some pro tips here as someone who helped make Kitty Hospice programs, and also has adopted and had elder kitties on kitty hospice (applies to more than cats, but it’s late and I’m just saying kitty here: swap out for doggy/other as needed):\n\n1. Buy a water proof mattress pouch and don’t put blankets you care about on the bed unless you’re willing to sacrifice them as end of life bladder emptying is far more rancid than normal kitty pee. \n\n2. Have a plan for off hours, weekends, and an objective idea of WHEN end of life will be. You need to make that decision of what your kitty is gonna be subjected too well ahead and adjust course as needed. You DONT wanna hear the poor fuzzy friend screaming in agony. You want them to live out what days they can comfortably, and planning this with a vet ahead of time will help. And because the universe loves you be mean, it has a decent likely hood of happening on a weekend or in the middle of the night. You don’t wanna be scrambling at 3am on a Saturday trying to sort it out when you can have a plan in place. \n\n2.5 make sure to set out objective metrics for what will constitute “the time.” Is it when mobility is impacted? Pain? (Please don’t let them hurt if you can avoid it.) working this out ahead of time with your vet helps so you aren’t agonizing on the spot every time a new symptom pops up. Most vets can walk you through what will and won’t be negatively impacting (hurting) your pet. \n\n3. Spoil your friend a little. Lots of elder kitties who spent their life indoors may not handle a harness well, but a supervised roll on the porch in the sun (if they aren’t a runner) can bring them lots of happiness. Maybe some fancy treats, extra snuggles, whatever your fuzzy friend really likes. Sometimes it’s just bringing in some cat safe plants for them to nibble on. \n\n4. It will be hard, but don’t leave the room when it’s time. In most cases you are their world and it’s heart breaking from the vet clinic perspective to see a scared animal watch their owner leave them right before end of life. In some cases you may be able to plan to have a mobile vet come to your house (and they aren’t always much more than taking them in). Not having to go to the vet can be much more calming for them if it’s practical/available in your area. \n\n5. If your kitty has been on medication/special food, see if your local vet/shelter accepts donations of unused portions. Some will take donations and provide to people who otherwise can’t afford it (some specialty stuff is expensive). \n\n6. Take pictures with them before the end, and some videos. It can help with the intense pain that can come grieving the loss of a friend. Try not to punch people who say it was just a pet. Our furry friends are a part of our family. It’s ok to be sad, and ok to miss them. \n\n7. Consider with end of life there is also what comes next. Many vets offer both individual and mass cremation, or will return the remains for home burial. Many will also take paw prints and/pr impressions on request. \n\n8. Be honest with your kids. If you just tell them your friend ran away, they will be besides themselves trying to find the pet. Losing a friend hurts. Death, hurts. But beating around that bush generally does more harm than good. Help your kids (and yourself) find ways to honor their memory. \n\nI’m not a vet or a nurse, but I was greatly involved in helping create and setup a kitty hospice program, and believe that home care for end of life (when possible, and not hurting your friend) can provide some extra time together. I’ve sat with my own (adopted) senior pets, and sat with others and their pets when the time came. Just being old isn’t a great reason to be put down, some older pets need more care but they also need more love. \n\nAlso, if you take your 10+ y/o friend to the pound to get a new kitten/puppy instead just because they are old, I have words for you.",

We had no idea we were taking her to the vet for something serious, and we’re told she’d be back home the next day after draining some fluids. \n\nShe got worse and worse and by the time we were called to see her the next day she was panting and gasping for air. They told us we may be able to extend her life for another week, month, year who knows. She was suffering and her heart actually caved in once during our conversation with the vet. They swooped into action to revive her before we could tell them to stop.\n\nIn the end we made the decision to put her down. She had stabilised slightly (still on oxygen laying down and panting) and luckily we could be right next to her whilst saying goodbye. She died in as much peace as we could possibly give her, and I wouldn’t have done it any other way.\n\nShe was only 6 years old and we thought we had many years left to go with her. Unfortunately she had spent 4 of those 6 years at a puppy mill in Hong Kong, and who knows what damage that caused (clearly a lot).\n\nMy girl had gone through enough suffering for a lifetime and it wasn’t right to prolong her life for the sake of our own benefit. I’m glad she’s finally at peace.",

After taking him to several Vets where they said he’s old and it’s time to consider putting him down, I was about to consider it but something inside me said to see a specialist. It turns out, he developed diabetes and kidney infection. We treated the infection and gave him insulin. He made a remarkable recovery and is still my healthy furry friend today. He is now 20 and still well.   \n\n\nThe human side now, a close family friend came down with just about every condition in the book starting in his 60s. They gave him last rites multiple times but he kept bouncing back.   \nWe just celebrated his 99th birthday and he is doing well. \n\nNever Give Up Hope and Faith!

My father and I were already completely distraught after having our lives stolen from us, and we didn’t think the surgery would be very invasive, which is how the vet described it.\n\nA few days later we get a call that Cricket has been resuscitated multiple times, and doesn’t resemble anything like a healthy dog, and we eventually let her go of her suffering.  When I go to say goodbye to my dog I notice her back is cut all the way open. I thought it was a small procedure, if I had known the scale it’d been on, it’d have said my goodbyes earlier and not even have went through the surgery.\n\nThe thought of my dog’s suffering was unbearable and they’re like your children.

My dad had to take him to the vet as he had a hard time breathing, wouldn’t eat, had diarrhea, and would vomit.

Saturday I had to take him in as an emergency and he got worse and not better and because I was there, I was able to tell the vet to put him down as he has been suffering long enough. I feel as though my dad made him suffer the last couple of days than he should have, only because he said he was still fine and refused to put him down months ago.",

I did a lot of research on pulmonary masses, lung cancers, and cancers in general and I don't want to put her through that.  So reading your post and the comments here are pretty re-assuring.  My cat is still young (7) so I keep hoping what they saw was not a mass but I at least feel ready to make certain decisions if it comes to that.  I am going to go by the 50/50 rule which is when the number of bad days start to outweigh the good, then it's time to call an in home vet.",
