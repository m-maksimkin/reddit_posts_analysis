    "LPT: wear earplugs to loud concert venues. Tinnitus is real and not fun.\nYou can still hear the music just fine. After many years of loud shows, I’ve got tinnitus pretty bad. Hearing loss is no joke. Lots of people wear them at shows, and don’t worry about someone judging you. Stay healthy!": [

Ditto for social places like restaurants and bars — why have the background music so loud that people can’t have conversations?? The worst seems to be venue rentals for parties — I spent most of a retirement party looking blankly at people because I couldn’t have a conversation. By definition retirement party are for old people to say goodbye, so for the love of whatever turn the music down!! I’ve even been to church services that were blaring and overly loud. (For that one I tried to fix it directly by volunteering to run sound board, but even when I turned the congregation speakers nearly off, it was still loud because of the musicians’ speakers.) I know that my hearing isn’t particularly sensitive, and in fact I too have tinnitus, so it blows me away that consistently sound designers think this is a good idea or that people enjoy being assaulted by sound. My kids and hubby do have sensitive hearing, and it’s common for places to be overwhelming for them.\n\nI’ve become fond of attending concerts that are targeted to Boomers and Gen Xers because they start at a reasonable time, people actually sit in their seats, and the music is less likely to be deafening.",

I served in the National Guard in a tank unit as a driver, loader and gunner on an M60 tank.

Loud noises, like gunfire and explosions, especially, go right through the bone of your skull and damage the mechanisms of your ears.\n\nThe choices we make, especially when young, can have life-long consequences.  I guess the moral of the story is that it's easy to make choices with significant risk when you're not presently experiencing the consequences that will result from those choices.

I studied audiology under Professor Kornagel, who made significant scientific progress in the field of hearing aids and signal processing. I also researched on the topic of tinnitus for half a year under Prof. Zwanger who specialized in the fields of MRI imaging. Prof. Zwanger had an idea about a therapy, another student and me realized it and made a small subject study with mostly friends and family. Afterwards we wrote a scientific elaboration on the topic of tinnitus, possible treatments and our attempted Tailor-Made Notched Music Training. My father and one of my best friends have tinnitus which is why I am quite passionate about the topic.\n\nMost Tinnitus therapies have around a 0-20% success rate. Hereby pharmaceutical therapies did NOT show statistically significant better success rates. However most researchers of the ICMT (International Conference on the Management of Tinnitus) said that they believe there will NOT be one golden therapy for everyone. But rather that everyone responds to a different therapy, as they might have different tinnitus subtypes. Tinnitus can have many causes such as viral or bacterial infection, hearing loss, sonic trauma, inflammation of the ear or age-related hearing loss.\n\nThe point is that most people feel discouraged because they think that science is still not far enough to treat their condition, so they won’t even try any therapy. In severe cases this can even lead to social isolation and depression.\n\nIn my opinion the best solution currently is to try as many low-effort (some therapies can be done from home), non-evasive therapies as possible in hope that you hit the one that works for your tinnitus. And I know that tinnitus patients are often unmotivated to try new therapies (I tried a therapy on my father and one of my best friends. I literally had to convince them to try and listen to some special notch filtered music at home). Also information is often part of medical treatment. For example the Heidelberg music therapy involved a doctor lecturing subjects on the topic of hearing and tinnitus in general. So I would recommend researching the topic. Take care that you don’t drift into dubious money making people, as there are sadly quite a lot of these online. The last thing I would recommend is making an otologist appointment and asking them for a “Recruitment Test”, such as ABLB for example. As tinnitus often comes along with with recruitment, which is a  hypersensitivity to the perception of loud sounds.\n\nThe Prof wanted us to program something that can analyze your tinnitus frequency (sometimes frequencies and sometimes with specific noise bandwidths) and cut them out music of your choice in an attempt to lie the tinnitus into the music and thus make it less hearable. If anyone is interested I could ask the Professor if I can distribute it freely (I think so, he’s normally pretty nice and cool).\n\ntl;dr: try low-effort, non evasive therapies in hopes that you hit the therapy that works for you. Educate yourself on the topic and make a “Recruitment Test” at a ear doctor. Don’t get discouraged and be careful about dubious online therapy ads.

I wish he could hear what I hear for just a few minutes.  It would drive him insane!  And what is up with people still taking at the same volume with masks on as they usually do?  I can barely hear them, and I can't read their lips to compensate.  Please speak up people when masked!!!",
