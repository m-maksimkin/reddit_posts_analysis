    "LPT: When moving into a new house, create a separate email account for the house.\nI asked for advice on moving into our first house a while ago and this was one of the tips. We did it and had no idea how handy it would be.\n\nWe have all our bills, white goods receipts, WiFi, everything, set up with this account and it‚Äôs amazing.\n\nPeople are always amazed when they find out, even estate agents. Thought I‚Äôd share the love, hope it helps.\n\nEDIT: thanks for the positive comments, it helped us out when we got our first place so hope it helps as well. A lot of people are asking what ‚Äúwhite goods‚Äù are. It‚Äôs like household appliances and I assume it‚Äôs a British term.\n\nEDIT: also a lot of people are saying it‚Äôs useless or more work, it‚Äôs just a personal opinion that it‚Äôs handy. I also like that my spouse can be logged in as well and handle any bills as I work away a lot\n\nEDITEDIT: this blew up and I didn‚Äôt think it would. Not sure why this is such a divisive topic, half seem to love it and half hate it. The majority of the other side are saying just make a folder in normal gmail. I‚Äôm not saying this will work for everyone but we have busy personal lives with my spouse being a freelancer with the need for multiple emails, and myself likewise. I know how to use folders and have many set up in my work emails, this just works best to keep it entirely separate. Spouse has access to my personal emails whenever she wants by just going on my phone, but why would she want to receive all my boring newsletters about classic cars and old Volvos in her inbox? Also, it‚Äôs just a small tip that helped me out, no one‚Äôs forcing you to do it. Glad it helped some, have a great week": [

You can use this new alias to create utility and other accounts but all the emails will come to the original account as most email providers will just ignore whatever is after + sign. This way you save yourself the hassle of creating a new account but have a new alias for a new address etc and create a rule to move all emails for new alias as recipient to be moved to selected folders etc.\n\nOf course, this hack can be applied to other situations.",
