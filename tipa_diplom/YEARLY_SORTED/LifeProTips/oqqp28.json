That was a friend of mine who was trying to have kids, and his wife had 7 miscarriages; my ex-wife thought my friend's wife was standoffish and therefore a bitch so didn't like hanging with her(and therefore him), so I finally said because i felt it important that she have compassion and empathy that my friend's wife was dealing with miscarriage after miscarriage for the last few years.  But I had to preface my leak of info that I was pretty sure my friend's wife didn't know I knew so don't fucking say anything, just be nicer to her okay.\n\nHappy ending: after years of trying they decided to adopt, they were 2 years into the process, with a false start with that process too, and had just given up on adoption, got a dog, when she finally carried a child to term, and has since had 3 kids in quick succession.

All these assets were transferred to the accounts of cryptocurrency exchanges, where he was trying to increase this amount, I quote: \"so that everyone was good, but something went wrong, again\" as he pointed out in his suicide note.

Moving on, I got into another and because of the previous relationship I felt ALL relationships are like that between couples. NOPE. So I told my then present SO about a mutual friend's GF (both the GF & friend I knew before SO) was starting to see another guy. I had promised her I wouldn't tell anyone, but I was a couple, right? I viewed my SO as an extension of me. Bad thought there. He went back and told the friend. Shit hit the fan and she came directly back  to me. I denied telling anyone, because I hadn't....except...yep, my SO. I WAS FURIOUS WITH THEM.
