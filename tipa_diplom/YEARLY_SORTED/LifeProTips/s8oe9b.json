    "LPT: when you’re in a financial pinch or saving money, Instead of eating Ramen, eat Potatoes. Potatoes are cheaper, have more nutritional value, and will keep you full longer.\nIt’s a common saying that someone “lives off ramen” when they are broke, and most of us have been there. But instead, try potatoes. They are more nutritious, aren’t filled with preservatives and sodium, and will keep you full longer. Also they are an excellent source of potassium. And cheaper.": [

            "text": "I know that this isn’t in everyone’s budget when money is tight, but if possible, buy a rotisserie chicken and get a week+ worth of meals from it! \n- eat each breast with a potato or can of vegetables as a meal \n- pick off and shred the dark meat and make chicken salad (add mayo, relish, mustard… all could be from free condiment packets) and eat chicken salad sandwiches 3 days \n- boil the bones in water with salt, pepper, onion, and a carrot if possible and make homemade stock. Mix in cooked rice and cut up the boiled carrot and you have simple soup. You can also add any other veggies or a diced potato if that’s available. \n\nThis was how I fed myself nutritious food in scant months in college. \n\nTotal cost for items from Walmart is about $20 \n(and the rice and potatoes will last more than one week). \nPotatoes: $2.50 for 5 lbs \nChicken: $9 \nBread: $1 per loaf \nCarrots: $1 for a 1 LB bag\nOnion: $0.50\nRice: $2.50 for 5 lbs \nCanned veg: $0.50 per can \n\nAgain, I understand not everyone even has $20 to shop but this is the most nutritious way I’ve found to stretch my food with a small budget.\n\nETA: fixed typo in price of canned veg",

It was hearty, filling, satisfyingly flavorful, quick and easy (only one day of about 30 minutes prep, while the rest of the 2-4 weeks were just reheating, or adding something into it which took a couple minutes at most).\n\nMy starter recipe:\n\n- a carton of some type of stock\n\n- a packet of taco seasoning\n\n- a 28oz can of some type of tomatoes (something chunky like diced, peeled, or stewed)\n\n- at least a lb of ground meat\n\n- couple of diced potatoes\n\n- can of beans\n\n- some frozen mixed vegetables (the kind with green beans, peas, carrots and corn, or just only corn)\n\nThose stuff are just a start, and like I said it's hearty and filling. During my broke months I probably had 2 servings of ~1½-2 cup(s) per day and I was good and didn't feel like I was going to bed hungry, so yeah it lasted me a long time and surprisingly and honestly, can't say I got sick of it.\n\nUsually I would see some canned beans, canned tomatoes, or carton/cans of stock on sale and I would jump at those opportunities... Hell it's been 2 years I still have a few cans of beans in my pantry from those days...\n\nI would also buy like the cheapest pack of whole wheat bread and have a slice or 2 with my serving of the stew. Throughout the 2 weeks I would add more stock (or water if I'm out and add some Cajun seasoning, taco seasoning, salt, pepper, etc.), add in some fresh squash/zucchini, mushrooms, other frozen veggies, etc. Cook and cut up sausages to throw in there for a REAL satisfying meaty hearty treat.\n\nSomething I just realized I could have done is probably add some rice to it to make it even more hearty and filling, and to be more frugal, buy those chicken bullion stock powder things, those would probably last a lot longer.\n\nSide note: the stew should be pretty thick and hearty, not watery.\n\nThe reason why I make and finish the stew in 2-4 week cycle is because by the end of the 2-4 weeks, so much stuff was melted into it, the flavor while great, started to get overwhelming and my body would crave for something fresh so a new batch was the solution. Oh, and you should not put seafood into it. I didn't, but I've read it's not something you want in a dish that would be kept for a long time.",

Also, msg if you're okay with it and can find it (usually at Asian markets.)

In Canada you can get a 5lb bag of potatoes for $5 CAD, which is about $2.20/kg.\n\nBut I understand you're probably from the US and your audience is US/Canada. OK, let's go with the CAD price.\n\nDoing a random search online for Mr. Noodle in Canada, I see a pack of 5 x 85g for $2.20 CAD. The same price as a kg of potatoes so that makes comparison a bit easier.\n\n1kg of potatoes nutrition: 770 cals, 1g fat, 175g carbs, 20g protein\n\n5 pack of Mr Noodles nutrition: 1900 cals, 60g fat, 290 carbs, 50g protein\n\nYou'd need to eat more than twice the cost in potatoes to catch up to the ramen.\n\nOf course, potatoes are healthier bc more nutrients and ramen sodium is much too high to eat a lot of it but the occasional 1/2 pack or 1 pack of ramen will give you more energy protein per dollar than potatoes will. Also, nobody eats potatoes plain, you need butter, milk, sour cream or whatever fat to make it palatable. I need at least 5-10g of butter on one potato to make it taste good, suddenly making it less healthy and a lot more expensive too. So potatoes alone, healthy, potatoes as we actually eat them, less so.\n\nYou'll go much further with pasta than potatoes for calories/cost and nutrition. Pretty much no fat, high carbs, but also a decent amount of protein. Top it with tomato sauce and you don't need much fat to make it taste good, either.",
