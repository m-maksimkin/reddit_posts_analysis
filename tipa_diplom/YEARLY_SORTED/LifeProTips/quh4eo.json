    "LPT - when someone insults you during a meeting, pretend as if you did not hear them and ask them to repeat what they just said. They will either apologize or confirm their unprofessional behavior to the meeting audience - the latter can not be accepted.\nPsychological safety makes or breaks teams. Aggressive language should therefore be avoided at all time and actively eliminated from corporate cultures. The tip above helps flagging that insults are not accepted in the workplace.": [
