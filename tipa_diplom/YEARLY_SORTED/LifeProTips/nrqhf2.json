Obviously, not everyone has that mentality, but actually most either don’t mind or don’t care unless someone brings it up. I sold cars for 4 years and well over half the cars I sold drove off the lot with both the dealership decal and license plate frame on them. If they had a custom one on their trade, I always asked. Many times people were driving home with temp paper tags that would flap in the wind so unless they had another frame I’d put ours on to make sure they didn’t get a ticket from a quota happy officer. I took zero offense when people would ask/demand for our insignia to be removed, but there were some people that demanded a license plate frame to be included in the deal, like they were getting something free (all our vehicles came with them anyways). \n\nOne bit of advice is always make sure the dealership removes them if you don’t want it. Even stickers can take the paint off, or you may not be careful and do something stupid like using a screwdriver to pry it off and gash the paint. If they do it prior to you taking possession, it’s still their car, even if you signed all the paperwork already. Don’t stress about it, the salesmen don’t care, but make sure you bring it up before you go into finance. They can have the cleaners remove it, as they are usually the same guys that put them on. I don’t have any experience with ones that are ‘bolted’ on, our dealership just had beefy stickers that could be peeled off by hand. Also, this isn’t entirely related but I’d always recommend custom ordering a vehicle as opposed to buying off the lot, in which case you can specify then that no dealership insignia be added.",

One of the “little”things that pissed me off to no end was when I took my newly bought Honda Civic in to get some minor work done (my wife had a rock chip some paint off).  I get the car home and realize the company had taken my license plate covers off (which I paid $15 for) and replaced them with their company’s own.  I called them and they acted like they knew nothing about it.  I ended up driving back down and I showed them the covers and one of the mechanics piped up saying “oh, yeah, we do that all the time”.  They had THROWN OUT my covers!!!!  They refused to cover the cost of them, and I left because $15 wasn’t worth my time in court fees or having an officer come over to take my report.  I did end up posting a review that this had taken place and, over the next few months, I had read several other reviews of this happening.  Never went back to them, and never thought twice about it.  And what really sucks is that they actually did a really good job.  They would have had a pretty good customer because my car is apparently attracted to small objects!!!",
