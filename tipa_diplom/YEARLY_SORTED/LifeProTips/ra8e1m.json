    "LPT: Buying a luxury car isn't the expensive part, maintaining it is.\nI worked in the auto industry for several years and this is something I feel is important for people to know.  Everyone wants a luxury car and buying them used isn't usually too bad, but when they break and it comes time to fix it; what would normally cost $200 on a Honda is $1,200 on a BMW.\n\nBe mindful of the repair costs on a car before you buy them.": [

We leased it because in my opinion; the hybrid battery tech will be likely outdated after our 4 year term and the amount of high end tech will break our wallets if we decided on the purchase and had to repair it out of warranty, on top of living in the rust belt with all the road salt it wouldn't be practical to purchase the SUV to own with the panels and exhaust likely rotting out of it after 7-8 years anyway. On top of all that I'm a red seal mechanic with years of experience and there really isn't much I can fix on this SUV without the workshop manual and scan tool needed to fix it. I can barely see the serpentine belt from the top of the engine bay and without a hoist you couldn't pay me to fix it because it just ain't worth my time. \n\nLeasing high end luxury vehicles is definitely the way to go for so many reasons if you have the means to do so. You can do it smart if you have the cash to put down and you end up with positive equity at the end of the lease if you do the math and you set up the lease properly. We put $15,000 down on the trade in of our older car(so wasn't worth that much but the high used car resale values helped us a lot there) on top of $9000 we decided to put down in multiple security deposits reduced our interest rate by 1% on the already low interest rate of 2.9%. So we're paying 1.9% interest over a four year term with a guaranteed $42K resale value and I get that $9K security deposit back at the end of the term - I'll just thrown it straight down as capital for the next lease and rinse/repeat. If we keep it in great shape we can likely profit some on the resale value/buy back and we have a new luxury vehicle every 4 years without the hassle of rust and put of warranty repairs. We're very fortunate to be able to afford and drive such a beauty of a vehicle without all the hassles involved down the road.",

            "text": "Another related LPT: Doing your own work can help offset these costs, so if you have the time, the space, the money to invest in some specialty tools, you can easily cut your yearly maintenance bill in half and make it comparable to a Honda/Toyota. For example, I just purchased a used luxury car ('18 Audi S5 Sportback) from Vroom. Took it to the dealer to have it inspected, which brought up $1,011.26 of items that needed maintenance immediately. The parts cost a total of maybe ~$400. The tools needed cost another ~$250, but are one-time purchases, including VAG COM software and cable to use to interface with the car, which I'll need on every other maintenance project/upgrade. So the next time it \"needs\" $1,000 worth of maintenance, it'll be $400, a night in the garage with a buddy, and a couple cold beers afterwards while we contemplate how much money I just saved. So if you the space, time, and determination to learn to be able to do your own maintenance, it costs significantly less to own a luxury vehicle. Yes, I know Audi parts are more expensive than Honda parts, before you harp on that point to discredit my point.",

A year into owning it I noticed a strange sound when idling in traffic next to tall concrete road dividers (the sound would echo back to me) and significant power loss. Took it in and found out there was a clogged oil journal in the back of the case (or block) that literally starved one of the banks. Complete engine removal and tear down with full rebuild.

It doesn't take long to go from, \"Hey, I can get a 10 year old Mercedes for the same price as a new (insert cheap@$$ car here),\" to  \"What do you mean an oil change costs $150?!?!?!?\"\n\n\nI keep mine because of sentimental reasons and because it's still in damn good shape.  Also, it's from the insanely overbuilt era of M-B.\n\nBut there is literally nothing cheap about this car.  Nothing.  It even requires premium gas.   It is 100% a labor of love for me.\n\nLike I said, an oil change is $150.\n\nNew tires are usually in the $500+ range.\n\nHell, even a new hood ornament is $40 just for the part.\n\nI'm willing to sink money into mine because it is truly a well above average car, plus at this point it's practically a family member.\n\nBut it's a long-running joke in the older M-B crowd that \"the most expensive car in the world is not a Ferrari, or a Bugatti, or anything like that.\n\nIt's an older German luxury car that \"just needs a few things\".\"",
