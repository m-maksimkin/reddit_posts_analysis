    "LPT: When a Nurse asks you to rate your pain on a scale of 1-10, never say 10+.\nThe pain scale isn't necessarily used only to tell us how bad your pain is, it's supposed to be used to tell us whether your pain is getting better or worse. If a patient says their pain is a 7 in triage, and later says it's pushing a 9, that X-Ray or CT scan might get expedited.  But if your constantly barking 10 or 1,000 your comments aren't going to be taken seriously. A (good) nurse knows a 10 when they see it, and if you walked in, you are not in 10/10 pain. That guy from Saving Private Ryan with his legs blown off on Normandy beach screaming for his momma, that dude is in 10/10 pain. Also, Kidney Stones.": [

A patient saying “10” could be a patient not understanding the question, or a patient with an agenda. The agenda could be to get you to understand that the pain is concerning or an emergency to them. \n\nAlso, wailing or visible distress is not the best indicator either. A woman I treated had three kids by natural childbirth. One labor for 22 hours. She said she was wailing, screaming, sweating… but her ulcerative colitis pain was 100x worse. She never cries out on pain like she did in labor. Few people can tell she is even in pain most of the time, but it’s excruciating. Labor pains and kidney stones are on any person’s top 10 lists of most painful experiences.\n\nThe undisputed champion is severe burns. I have treated. Burn patients at the point of injury all the way until post-op. Many of these patients are in such extreme pain they pass out or are placed in a medically induced coma. Some of those patients show incredible resiliency in not expressing that pain, but brain scans show the same activity as those that are screaming in pain. \n\nDon’t let your bias of external emotion fool you into thinking you know what is happening. \n\nThe same concept goes for different cultures and facial expressions as well when expressing emotions. Just as some people don’t Telegraph emotions like most westerners, people can fake emotions or lack of emotions very well.\n\nWhen I lost my leg to an IED in Afghanistan, I felt very little pain in the beginning. In fact… I felt almost no pain at all at the primary injury site. But the loss of my leg was shocking and I cried out. It was also easier to express that pain when there was a visible sign that I should be in pain.\n\nMy recovery was exponentially more painful than the actual loss of my leg. In fact, it hurts more now than it did when the blast ripped it away from my body. Am I crying out in pain? No. Did I ever cry out during my recovery like I did right after the blast? No. I learned to lock it up. It didn’t reduce the pain, but keeping it together helps me to deal with it and stops people who can’t do anything about it from asking if they can do something about it. And that’s the big lesson we learn about pain when we grow up. Crying out doesn’t help to deal with the pain, it’s only a show of shock or cry for attention.\n\nI got pain medication back then when I wasn’t in pain, and I get none now that I am in pain. \n\nIf you don’t know pain, don’t try to lecture the rest of us on how to act so you can believe us or not. Call the doctor and let him make the decision because not only are you NOT a doctor (and your opinion about my pain doesn’t matter) but you lack the empathy of a nurse (the only use for you other than fetching ice chips and changing bed pans). Trying to deal with the embarrassment of being in constant pain is bad enough without your arbitrary standards on what I should tell you or not. Just shut up and get the doctor, you can’t actually help anyone, anyway.",

It's incipient now but I can manage it with meds.\n\nPoint is that, I don't need much anesthetic for drilling a cavity.  I got a vacecomy and was conversational the whole time.  I've had stiches without anesthetic.  Had a wrist surgery where it took the dock 12 tries to find a vein because I was dehydrated and he was obviously out of practice.  I didn't mind.\n\nIt doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt.  It's just my absurd pain tolerance.  It still hurts though.\n\nYou are correct in never saying \"10\".  A 10 is unconscious or incoherent.  We're talking shattered pelvis or kidney stones as mentioned.  My buddy had to be pumped full of Dilaudid when he had kidney stones and he's a tough guy.  He doesn't even take Tylenol but the kidney stones knocked him out for days.\n\nMy wife can take absurd amounts of pain.  30 years with hip dysplasia made it so that she doesn't feel pain normally anymore as well.

But whereas my heart episode might last 20 seconds to a few minutes, it goes away and I'm fine (pain-wise) and will just need rest, whereas my subluxed shoulder is affecting my nerves and may affect my mobility/ ability to cook/ clean and other essential self-sufficient things. \n\nSo the pain scale when it comes to other uses sucks, and if you're in a similar situation of being consulted for a long-term, health thing, redirect/ rephrase their question and explain *how* your pain affects your daily needs and ability to do things. (I like to rephrase it as: x and y incapacitates me and I cannot make or get food, severely affects my mood, cannot focus on simple tasks, etc. // a and b affects my ability to make food, go for walks, etc.)  Also reminder again that chronic pain people have high tolerances for pain and have been conditioned to minimize their pain, so still, take the pain scale with a grain of salt and pay attention to what and how the pain is being explained and externally may show (sweating, glazed look, hunched over, shaking, flushed, etc.)",

Barely able to speak, I expressed that I was in extreme pain and I would like to see a doctor as soon as possible. There appeared to be 20 people ahead of me in the waiting room, all of which seemed to be calmly reading magazines. My leg kept wanting to writhe out due to pain. I was legitimately terrified. All I could do was intently stare at the floor and try to think of nothing. Sweat was running down my face. After \\~30 minutes (felt like hours) I asked a nurse if someone could help because the pain was getting worse, and she said it would probably \"only\" be another 45 minutes. Another dozen or so minutes passed and it was worse. I felt like I might vomit, or maybe from the other end. No garbage cans in sight, but I remembered seeing a sink in that room I was in earlier, so I attempted to run over to that room and that same nurse I talked to earlier was standing in it, and as she started to say \"I TOLD you it would be another fort-\" I vomited a large volume of neon green liquid all over the floor and partly into the sink. Without missing a beat the nurse said \"The doctor will see you now\". Turned out I had a pretty severe bile duct blockage due to gallstones. Someone later apologized to me, because apparently that hospital had a lot of people come into the ER making similar claims in an attempt to get opiates, and my \"calm\" demeanor did not help.\n\nTL;DR: Can confirm, did not have good nurses; they could not tell how much pain I was in.",

Didn't touch me at all. 6 hours of unbearable pain later, they give me an IV drip of Dilaudid and Tetronol orally. That finally got the pain under control.",

It took nearly 16 hours because nothing in my body is positioned like it should be.  I have weird congenital back deformities coupled with extensive damage from 2 herniated discs that I worked through for nearly a decade.  \n\nWhen I finally woke up, many hours after they'd said it would take, no part of my back would move and the pain was tremendous.  They went through my abdomen and my back.  So horrific pain ran back to front.  It felt like I had been sawed in two and crudely stitched back together.  \n\nI'd tell the nurses pain was a 10 and they didn't believe it.  They also didn't believe it when I said my back wasn't working \\*at all\\* so I couldn't hardly get out of bed to use the rest room without someone at least helping me up.\n\nWhen the surgeon finally talked to me, he asked if my back felt better and I laughed hysterically about it.  Not only was it not better, I'd never been in that much pain my whole life.  \n\nHe said for me to rate my pain from one to ten with 10 being the most pain I've ever been in and I said 10.  Every time they asked, pain was a 10.  They sort of rolled their eyes and would fight me about it.  One nurse said, \"so if I shot you in the torso, you're telling me that wouldn't be more painful\"?  I told him, I don't know if that's more painful, that's never happened, but as of now, this is the most pain I've ever been in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey did load me up with oxycodone, morphine, and dilaudid.  And I'm fairly certain they were so understaffed and overbooked that nurses weren't communicating so I got dosed probably higher than I was supposed to.....  but they did finally drug me up to the point that it was only horrific pain rather than the worst I've ever felt.  \n\nI told them just to dope me up enough that I can sleep through the pain, and that's what they did.",

I got in my car and drove myself to the base ER. I parked and walked in under my own power. I told the triage nurse that it was like 3-4 out of ten, but I could definitely feel it getting tighter and more painful. \n\nWell she never checked on me for an update and by the time I was moved to a room, I was doubled over in pain, tears streaming, barely able to breathe. At one point an older man who arrived after me but got triaged before me told the nurse that collected him to \"help that man.\"\n\nBy the time the ER Dr walked into the room, he immediately did 2 emergency muscle relaxer injections directly into my back followed by a pretty intense escalation of treatment. He checked with triage who told him I checked in as a 3/10 and that he was pretty convinced that by the time he walked into the room I was easily as in as much pain as a person could be in. He thanked me for my honesty, but told me that there's \"smart honest\" and \"dumb honest\". \n\nMe cautioned me not to be dumb honest in the future.

I’ve been at a 10 post surgery because my pain was unmanaged and since then I’ve had PTSD trigged my medical encounters. I physically cannot cry around most medical providers. I will be sobbing and you walk in the room and the tears dry up. I don’t think you are safe because I have been yelled at, invalidated, and threatened for expressing my pain by medical providers and told to be quiet and not cause problems. I feel very uncomfortable with someone who is not my partner pushing my in a wheelchair and I’m not going to agree to get in one unless I absolutely can’t drag myself in. I live with a very high level of pain on a daily basis but it’s still very bad. I’ve just learned to somewhat deal with it. \n\nSo in private yes somedays I’m going to actually look like the very high pain level. Sobbing in bed, screaming into a pillow, puking when the pain gets too bad, unable to walk to the bathroom so I have to crawl or just not make it.

Now it is a 7!\" Before I could say \"It is and 8 now!\" I was gripping the side of the ER bed so hard my knuckles were white and the railing I was holding onto started to get loose.\n\nThat is when they immediately got me in to get an MRI and thankfully it was nothing more than \"the worst case of tendonitis I have ever seen.\"\n\nPain scales give medical professionals a lot of useful information. Be honest about it. Yes, it hurts, but is is really a 10+?",

            "text": "I went from a zero to a 4, then a 7, and shortly after a 10 within the span of about 2 hours when I developed acute ovarian torsion due to a growth the size of a fist on my Fallopian tube that decided to do a flip and choke off blood flow to my ovary halfway through the day. \n\nFelt fine when I woke up, went home from my boyfriend’s place feeling like I had gas or period cramps, chucked myself in a warm bath upon arrival at home, had a couple tylenol, tried to take a shit (not in the tub lol). The pain just got worse with each passing minute to the point where I piled myself out of the tub, threw clothes on my soggy self and headed to the closest urgent care facility to me, where the triage nurse immediately asked what I drugs was on because this urgent care facility was in a rough part of town and I was grinding my teeth so hard, barely able to focus, and actively screaming in the triage area as waves of pain hit me. They wanted me to give a urine sample and I couldn’t even do that. They didn’t want to give me anything for the pain because of where the facility was, in case I was drug-seeking. I remember wanting to tell the triage nurse to go to hell when she told me to stop being so dramatic when I was literally on the floor in the examination room begging for someone to please help me because I couldn’t even get onto the bed. There was no comfortable position to lie in. No way to ease the pain. It was just wave after wave of gripping abdominal agony that ripped through my spine, my hips, and my upper thighs with no end in sight. It hurt when it seemed to stop, and it hurt even more when it surged back again. They initially suspected a burst cyst, or strong menstrual cramps, but I had no history of cysts, and I had finished my period a few days earlier and was on the pill at the time, so menstrual cramps weren’t a viable explanation.\n\nThey had me break it down into frequency of pain along with a scale. When I was admitted, I was fluctuating from a 6 or 7 to a 9 roughly every five minutes. When it was at its worst, I was at a steady 8 that would crescendo into a 9 or 10 every three minutes or so, and I was damn confident with that 10. Once they hooked me up to fluids and morphine it ebbed back down to a 7 or 8 when the waves came but it was still pretty constant. The drugs took the edge off, but they definitely didn’t make it go away. \n\nAfter a pelvic examination where the doctor physically felt the inflammation of my ovary, transportation to an actual hospital, and a pelvic ultrasound, I was taken to surgery close to 12 hours after I first thought I was just gassy. A growth the size of a dude’s fist had developed on my Fallopian tube at some point and they cut the whole tube out because it was wrecked, but managed to save the ovary at the cost of half my potential to become pregnant naturally since my left ovary just… hangs out on its own now. Never got any further explanation. Had a follow up ultrasound about a month later and all they had to say was that they biopsied the growth and it wasn’t cancerous, and my lonely ovary looked perfectly healthy (though a bit disconnected from its usual goings on since it was no longer able to scoot ova into my uterus on a bi-monthly basis.) Was it a cyst? An ectopic pregnancy? An infection gone awry? This thing just popped up of its own accord and decided to fuck up my life one day, end of story. To this day I have no insight as to what it was, or how I might avoid it happening again. \n\nI’ve lived with migraines my entire life and no migraine I ever had or have had since came close to touching the pain I felt from ovarian torsion. It’s like your biological lizard brain kicks in, and all rational thought or aspirations of decorum and keeping calm just fly out the window. Going from perfectly fine, drinking coffee with my boyfriend in the morning to being in an examination room in urgent care, unable to stand from the pain within the span of 2 hours was terrifying. Maybe I always expected there would be some kind of warning that your body was about to wreck itself because of my migraine history, but had I not been so insistent that my pain was massive, things might have turned out differently. I know myself better than anyone else, and I’m absolutely trusting my healthcare provider to believe me when I say I’m rocking a 10.",

My sister who is a surgical nurse grabbed her by the arm and said \"His 10 is his appendix rupturing.\" The nurse got a little wide eyed and said \"Oh! I will be right back.\" \n\nNurse was back inside 5min with morphine. \n\nYou need to give a point of reference. Is it more or less painful than when you broke your arm? Is it pressure? Dull? Sharp? Electric? Burning? Throbbing? Describe your pain in detail.\n\nIf you just say \"It's a 10.\" While sitting there stone cold calm. They're gonna assume you're fine. But maybe that's just how you cope with pain.\n\nFor me, 8 is the threshold where I stop functioning. I'm unable to do most tasks. 9 is where I cannot speak and only scream. The one time I experienced a 10 I blacked out from pain. \n\nBut it's also a logarithmic scale for me. My Kidney stone at an 8 was only about half as bad as my appendix. But after a lot of time spent in hospitals explaining my pain, I've gotten very good at it.\n\nMy fiance by contrast cannot describe her pain beyond \"It hurts\" and her number scale is more of a percentage based system to what she seems to assume is the max. So if she says 10 it's the most pain she's ever experienced. But that doesn't give much reference unless you know every painful thing she's ever been through. Or unless she tells you. But she also has a shit memory and couldn't tell you what her most painful experience is. So whenever we've had to talk to her doctor I've had to prompt her with stuff like \"Better or worse than X.\"\n\nA good nurse or doctor with time will do that too looking at your medical records. However they rarely have that kind of time.\n\nIt behooves you to keep a mental list of those experiences and when going to an ER for pain place it on your scale. It hurts more than your broken finger but less than giving birth. It's a throbbing sensation, but also feels like a shock when you move too much.\n\nGive the doctor as much info as possible.",

First one started a few hours before work then just kept getting worse. Aside from having sliced my left arm open, six inches long starting at the wrist, it was the worst pain I'd ever felt. \n\nI couldn't stand up straight and after getting pissed off at me for it, I was written up and sent home for the day. At home, my stomach had started to hurt. Threw up and then urinated a much darker color than usual and decided \"doctor\", this wasn't just a real bad pulled muscle.\n\nI've never understood why something in the kidney was making me puke so often. But I drove to the ER and they had me sit down and fill out paperwork. When a nurse came out and asked me what I felt on the pain scale I doubt it was helpful but I said that it was the worst pain in decades and kept getting worse. For me, I guess that was around a 6-8 when compared with my fourth stone.\n\nI **almost** considered leaving when I asked what they would do and the average cost. All the nurses we're pretty damn sure it was a kidney stone and that it cost almost $3000 for a CT Scan, or if lucky, about....god, I think it was $700 for ultrasounds, depended on what the doctor would order. If it was actually a kidney stone. One of the male nurses had commented that he'd had them before too and we were matching up nearly everything I was feeling. It ended up running me over $8,000 which my insurance rejected for months for being an \"unplanned emergency\" and not consulting with them first and seeing one of their doctors before going to the ER. I'd even considered bluffing about going to find a lawyer to settle the issue. \n\nI ended up out-of-pocketing the majority of it, though I got some discounts for using cash and not credit. To add to the joyous occasion, even with my hospital paperwork I was written up a second time for leaving work for a \"medical non-emergency\". Accidents, grievous trauma, loss of sight and/or limb, heart attack, stroke, those were emergencies. Well it felt urgent as hell to me! Just wish it hadn't wiped my life savings at the time and messed with my credit since I had to fudge some bills to make enough money to pay them first.  \n\nStones two and three were just awful. Painkillers didn't do much, that's for sure.\n\nThe fourth, nearly like, seven-ish years later, I went in the middle of the night and doctor also wanted me off my feet because my kidney and whatever the tube is \"are pretty beaten up\". Was the biggest yet. Most were uric acid which is strange because I almost never eat foods with uric acid in it. Another was calcium I think.\n\nWell even with a doctor's note, I was suspended a week without pay for \"abusing\" sick days. Like, I'd called in maybe three times in the intervening years when I had the flu. Least we'd switched providers and I only out-of-pocketed around $4,000.",

            "text": "I have felt a 10. Pre surgery for a benign tumor I never knew I had one day I got out of bed and the best description I could ever give it was my head was trapped in a vice grip and if I pressed on it, it was bearable but if not the vice would get tighter around my head until I wanted to collapse. Evidently at that point the tumor inside of the 9th nerve had reached critical condition and was starting to balloon rather violently. The CT scan found it and 2 weeks later they were horrified to see the tumor was missing during an MRI the lead surgeon ordered before scheduling out the date. Because of the placement of the tumor, the sudden onset conditions, and everything else going on at the time I was in constant stabbing and crushing pain. We skipped Tylenol and went straight to oxycodone. Took less than 2 weeks for that to be too weak to keep the pain subsided on 4 hour doses they doubled my dose and then alternated in Percocet to really push me over. Thankfully I was already completely aware of everything going into my body that I didn’t latch onto the numbness that came with both of those opioids but hell they were a sweet relief. My symptoms leading up to the surgery (official diagnosis was April 24th 2019 and surgery was originally scheduled the week of the diagnosis) were extreme vertigo, pain, dizziness, fainting, and the one that continues to kick my ass to this day: chronic dysphagia. surgery was the day after my wedding May 13th 2019. My wife was being pushed around by the surgical staff and nutrition staff because I lost 44 pounds being immediately shifted to a g-tube and a liquid only diet.  So to maintain some say in my post op care my wife and I eloped. During the surgery my 9 hour planned surgery was extended 3 hours because I lost as the surgeons described “a red rivers worth of blood”. The excruciating pain that switched me to alternating between the oxy and Percocet was because my tumor had burst inside the nerve. I came out of surgery and when I finally became alert the only feeling I could give you a vague description to how I felt was a rocket powered Omni directional Ferris wheel where the cab was on almost like a giant sling shot band and I was ricocheting around the room. My head was pounding but I couldn’t talk because I was still in pain. Overheard them saying that I might feel intense loss of balance is because my vertigo problems were resolving themselves after they severed the nerve and basically giving my body a factory reboot after removing faulty components. \n\nNow I’m probably talking too much but post operation nutrition was second in the room and instructed them to put me on a 2 liter 24 hour continuous drip feed of formula and water into my tube as I was sleeping. Well despite complaints that my stomach wasn’t holding a lot of it down they pushed ALL OF IT INTO MY STOMACH while I was sleeping. Around 6 am the following day of surgery I shot up out of bed and retched all of that food mulch from my insides from my mouth and nose. It was hot as hell and it caused my lumbar drain to let loose a lot of excess cranial fluid all at once. For that pain I can’t put it into words but my head was clamped in a surgical brace, I was told not to get up without assistance or I could strain the incision site on the base of my neck or cause other head related issues to come up, and I wanted so so bad for them to take me out of my misery right then and there. I sat there being held up by my wife, her best friend, a neuro-ICU nurse that was scared as hell because she hadn’t dealt with someone losing so much fluids from so many places at once like that, and I was told they needed to call the surgeon immediately because that much loss from the lumbar drain and that amount of fluid loss could be fatal. 1 of the 3 surgeons showed up and checked on everything. The bandages covering the incision site from the base of my neck to around the ear showed signs of trauma because I was bleeding a little bit near the base of the near where my jawline is. Had to be awake but I was more or less given happy juice for the hour they cleaned and removed the bandages so they could re-stitch my neck. I had to have all 4 of my IVs done again (1 in each hand, and 1 in each forearm). There’s nothing that could ever come close in my lifetime to compare to that pain I felt before during and after. So if I’m going to the doctor and they ask it’s never going to be higher than a 5 until my head is killing me again. I also still have dysphagia but I’ve learned to eat again with a couple loopholes providing I’m very careful. I’ve had pneumonia a lot since surgery because I’ve been trying to learn what I can eat and what is now dangerous. \n\nEither way just thought I would share what I justify is a true 10/10 for pain",

Saying you are at a level 9-10 is based on the pain you have already experienced not by what you don’t know. Just because the pain scale means something different to the people who created it and most likely don’t deal with chronic pain or have been hit by a bus themselves doesn’t mean the average person knows that. And I’m sorry but pain is so minimized by the medical system that people are struggling to live life and be taken seriously. Pain can change within a very short time for some people and flip flop all around during the day especially with chronic pain. It’s not the worst imaginable pain it’s the worst pain you have experienced so far. The opioid Crisis has also made doctors not take people seriously when they are actually in pain. As someone who deals with chronic pain the pain scale is unfortunately not as effective as people want it to be. I understand that doctors use it as a tool and for various reasons but that is not what patients are asked. I’ve rarely been asked if my pain has gotten worse so why not just ask that instead of rate your pain on a scale of 1-10 (10 being worse pain imaginable) reality is you cannot imagine pain and can only compare it to what you have already experienced. What do you do in he case of raising tolerance due to being in pain for so long? It still hurts your just now used to the hurt, it never went away and actually didn’t really get better. Those people would rather not have to get used to it. And different types of pain can feel more or less intense. Tooth pain is awful and no wonder is used to torture someone. Nerve pain is awful! And the pain from getting shot or stabbed or hit by a bus is also absolutely awful. If your in enough pain you go into shock or pass out how are you going to rate your pain then. People can black out or completely dissociate to deal with the pain and not even remember what could have been the most imaginable pain.

Rarely 5. 3-4 on average if I'm on meds. But ... I always tell them my 9 is pretty damned high up there and explain what it was from. \n\n(My 9 isn't the spine stuff, it was the burns. Hours upon hours of the same intensity and drugs didn't help noticably at all until I finally slept from exhaustion. And I know it could be worse because I remained conscious and quiet through it.)\n\n....\n\nThat's the first thing a lot of patients don't get ... the pain scale is relative. You have no way of knowing if your 7 is someone else's 3 or 10. 10 for someone who has never dealt with truly bad pain is a fucking 3 for someone with metastatic pancreatic cancer (not me, but I've seen it a few times in others) or having a car still crushing your legs after being ejected. \n\n...\n\nAnd that's the second thing patients don't always get ... if you have enough mental clarity to -think- about it ... and possibly over act about it ... it's not a 10. 10 is you being unable to say much of anything except **\"10!\"**. \n\nI'm sounding grouchy here, guess I'm tired, but agreeing with the OP whole heartedly. Don't exaggerate. Don't try and make it sound higher to try and get taken more seriously.

In the middle of the night I finally climbed up off of my presumed deathbed and with the last of my will I manage to drive myself to the ER (was only about a mile away). Well, I just kinda pulled up and fell out onto the ground where a staffer got me and wheeled me inside.\n\nWhen I was in triage they asked how much pain I was in, and I said 10 or 11 (I can’t exactly remember, was mostly delirious) and they gave me an IV of hydromorphone before doing some other stuff I don’t remember and then rushing me to the operating room. When I woke up I was in my recovery room, and the Doctor told me that they had cut out my severely inflamed appendix just in time before it completely ruptured and killed me.\n\nWas this as bad a pain as an artillery shell blowing off my leg? I don’t know because that’s never happened to me. So a 1-10 pain scale is necessarily going to be relative to my own experience with pain, with “ten” being the most pain I’ve ever felt up to that point. But in the heat of the moment, it doesn’t matter. All I could think of was getting relief from the urgent, mysterious, judgement clouding world of pain I was in, and I’d do or say anything for the pain killers at that point. Literally anything.\n\nSorry for the somewhat rambling post, but what I’m trying to say is that if people are overstating their pain it probably is because they’re terrified that the staff is going to be needlessly and cruelly stingy with the painkillers. If hospitals in my country (the US) didn’t have a reputation for that kind of behavior, they’d probably get more “accurate” subjective pain reports.",

The scale is absolutely to evaluate the severity of pain to a patient, you literally cannot measure someone's pain or threshold for it. That's why there are established limits and guidelines for administering dosages and if the pain does not go down on the scale - the situation needs further evaluation... I genuinely fear for your patients if this is the attitude you have towards them. Would you be okay with immediate prejudice to your level of pain, based on your answer alone? *smh*\n\nIf \"a good nurse knows a 10 when she sees it\", then why bother asking at all?

What kind of 19 year old gets kidney stones (lucky me!?).\n\nSecond was after I played in a touch football league.  Was driving home felt like I had to pee and nothing was coming out.  Then the pain started and the shifting trying to get into a position that doesn't hurt (you never find it, it doesn't exist). So I walked into the ER a lil sweaty, beard and hair a mess from playing, and in agony and let them know I'm passing a kidney stone. \n\nThey do some blood work and give me a cup to pee into while in the waiting room. After I'd been waiting for about an hour and a halfish. I calmly (was probably at 6 or 7 on the pain scale) explain that I was playing sports and haven't had anything to drink since then and I've been peeing every 10 minutes because either I have a terrible uti or the much more likely kidney stone.  I manage to hold myself for about 30 minutes and squeeze as much pee as possible into the cup.  It was a few squirts.  Finally get back into a room, ultrasound shows I have a kidney stone(who knew !?) At this point my pain is at about a 5.  They tell me it's small enough to pass and tell me their gonna give me some morphine (no thanks) and iv fluids.\n\n\nI just want to go home at this point.  Ask for the flowmax and whatever pain meds theyre giving out for kidney stones at home so I can drive myself home and then feel nothing.  I didn't need to take up a bed (this was maybe 5 years ago) pre covid.\n\nAnyways my last stone was like July 2020.  Did telemed with my Dr.  Said this is a kidney stone and just got my cocktail of drugs and passed it.\n\nThankfully my stones are normally small enough to pass without getting the sound waves or laser beam stuff. \n\n\nTldr: kidney stones suck.  You don't want one. If they're too big they use Soundwave to break it up or you get a cath and they shoot lasers up your pee hole.",

Worse still, the tooth affected was a molar on the bottom right jaw, but the pain would radiate not only down to my chin, but also on my top jaw. The entirety of the right side of my mouth was essentially experiencing this pain. \n\nWhen I got my medicine from urgent care (a fairly low grade opiate), I only took what was prescribed. Nothing more. I know better than to fuck around with that stuff. It did not eliminate the pain, not even close. But it was enough for me to sleep. The extraction of my nerve from my tooth was the greatest relief I’ve felt to this day. Good God, I wish I could describe the alleviation and joy I had. I straight up cried.\n\nBut even then, my pain rating was 8.5/10, mostly because for me, I see a 9 is life threatening, and 10 feels like imminent death.

Her pain was 6/10 but when I asked what she couldnt do she said she couldn't move it at all because it hurt and moving her arm around hurt so I knew the pain was pretty bad. In the bed next to her was a young crossfitter who has dislocated their shoulder for the second time. They said 10/10 and were screaming and crying obscenities with the pain and demanding gas and air. When I asked them to move their arm they could. I'm not dismissing their pain I'm just saying that on a pain scale alone the shoulder dislocation seems to be more a priority based on this super subjective score out of ten.\n\nImpact to activities and progression of pain I'm more interested in (along with all the other great bits of SOCRATES)\n\nSpeak to someone who works in GP practice and they will probably regale you with tales of old people going \"I didn't want to bother you sorry but Ive got a little bit of pain in my chest, it's not bad but I just wanted to get it checked out, sorry to waste your time\" and it turns out their having a raging STEMI.",

I fell about 30ft according to the local police. This pain was fine, however, after my temporary cast was cut to see if the swelling went down for operation the release in pressure in the cast allowed the ruptured tendons to basically snap down to my ankle.\n\nThe docs didn't notice this and slapped the cast back on me. No operation that say due to swelling. The next day I got out of bed at home and went to take a piss. My foot turned black... Skipping blue and purple. The pain from all the blood rushing the the already swollen leg caused it to expand in the cast. My broken foot and ankle was expanding in a cast not designed for much swelling and this was causing the swelling to compress in on the broken bones and ruptured tendon site.\n\nThe pain only came when foot went below my hip so it was hard to show doctors anything... Most ignored me because I was more than happy to talk about what drugs i took on the regular (only weed) and took my for a bloody junky.

Other than the worst moments shortly after it happened, the pain was probably at most an 8 though. I was on gabapentin for a few months with ibuprofen as needed and cyclobenzaprine before I had an adverse reaction to it.\n\nAt the beginning of November I had hemorrhoidectomy surgery. When I woke up, the amount of pain I was in was staggering. I needed a percocet immediately. I was absolutely miserable and had to keep taking percocet as soon as I was due for another dose. Going to the bathroom was basically impossible, and whenever I would cease urinating my pelvic floor muscles absolutely annihilated my body.\n\nThen, not even two weeks after the surgery I had an enormous amount of pain on my right side but couldn't really focus on the source. Given the type of surgery I had just had, I thought it was appendicitis. I went to the ER and on the way I was doubled over, shaking a ton, and having freezing cold sweats.\n\nGot admitted and they found out it was a 4mm kidney stone (about as big as they get before surgery *starts* to get considered). I thought the surgery I just had was bad, but this was on a totally different level, short of removing organs or being maimed I don't think there's anything that could compare. I ended up getting two doses of morphine and one toradol dose while in the hospital. The wait before the first morphine dose and the wait for the next after it had worn off was unbearable. I was tossing and involuntarily moaning so much in the hospital.\n\nWas sent home with more percocet and I ended up having to take it regularly about half an hour, sometimes an hour, sooner than I should have because the pain was so bad. It was supposed to be 6 hours between doses, but the pain reducing effects lasted less than 2 for the most part. \n\nThe worst part about having kidney stones is the absolute inescapability of the pain they cause. There's no position where the discomfort lessens and sleeping doesn't stop the pain. It's just constantly there other than the times where you might get like half an hour of reprieve for an inexplainable reason. I would be up at 5 am, just pacing in a circle in my kitchen, trying to take my mind off of the pain. This lasted like 3 or 4 days and thankfully not any longer. Additionally I was thankful that there was basically zero issues when it came to actually passing the stone.\n\n\nDo yourself a favor and drink a lot of water, always.",

This ranges from having no idea I was in some of the most intense pain of my life until I told them (and even then treating it lightly), to being extremely considerate about almost completely painless procedures.\n\nThis includes multiple different doctors. And very often they THINK they know how much pain you're in so they don't even bother asking. So as a patient I would very strongly recommand that you make yourself heard. Saying 10/10 or more will of course not be treated seriously, but if you don't say anything they'll just assume you're fine. And if you look somewhat calm they're also going to assume you're fine, so when they ask you for a number don't respond with just a number - qualify it: \"It's too much to sleep\", \"I can't think of anything else but the pain\", \"it's taking all I have just to keep it under control\", etc.\n\n>That guy from Saving Private Ryan with his legs blown off on Normandy beach screaming for his momma, that dude is in 10/10 pain.\n\nHe's probably in shock and experiencing exactly 0/10 physical pain.

So he checks my head, there’s a massive bump like an peach size, he lifts up my top and my rib cage has black bruises all over it, he checks my reflexes in my hands and feet and they aren’t responding, he does an EKG (nurses were meant to but you know) and was instantly like right send her for all the scan and X-rays instantly, get a cardiologist and take blood.

Stood up and walked around with a broken foot after a skateboarding accident in my early 20s, went to work with broken ribs a few years ago, ridiculously high pain tolerance. I had dental surgery a couple months ago, and they did a bone graft as part of it. I was on ibuprofen and some sort of non-narcotic painkiller. *I did not let it wear off*. It just wasn't enough.\n\nI woke up on the second night, about an hour and a half after taking my meds, and thought I was going to die. I was in so much pain I was puking and sobbing and hysterical. My husband looked at me and said, \"I've never seen you cry from any kind of pain, we're going to the ER, RIGHT NOW.\"\n\nBy the time we walked in, I guess some kind of defense mechanism in my brain had kicked in. I was still in that much pain, but I could no longer really show it. I felt like I was melting. I was seriously, genuinely convinced I was dying. I was terrified and in excruciating agony. I thought the surgery site was infected and it was eating my brain. I might have been mildly hallucinating. I felt like I was trapped in a bubble. I told the nurse that it was a ten, that I'd never been in that much pain, that I thought my jaw was breaking, that I felt like my gums were ripping open and the bone was peeling out, and she didn't believe me. It took them an hour to get me painkillers, and that was only after I threw up again and around the time I thought my  normally-incredibly-gentle but also incredibly protective husband was going to rip someone's throat out over it.\n\nOnce I was morphined out of my gourd, the reality-switch in my brain turned back on and I finally started crying again. I sobbed for two hours. When they realized how hurt I actually was, the nurse apologized profusely.\n\nEveryone reacts to pain differently.",

They gave me enough fentanyl to kill several people my tolerance had gotten so high in the 2 weeks it took for the swelling to go down so they could operate. I vaguely recall waking up mid surgery and having a conversation with the surgeon and wiggling the leg they were not operating on when he asked me if I could move. \n\nEnded up punching a hole in the wall, spat on a charge nurse. (same charge nurse that called security on me, and kicked me out of the hospital at 2:30am after I asked for something to help me sleep after an adult circumcision. Detained by police and brought back to the hospital before 3:00am a month or so before I broke my leg) I got held down by 6 security guards while they waited for some real heavy duty sedative/benzo to do its worked.

Even if you know it's going to do nothing or make the long term situation worse. You don't care in the moment because anything, anything feels better than the pain you're feeling in that moment. I still hate that charge nurse though. I know murderers with more compassion, empathy better listening skills and less ego than her.

            "text": "The thing is, pain is relative. My pain scale is different than yours. Without set definitions (emojis are not enough) it’s hard to have people agree what intense pain is. Someone who experiences chronic pain and/or has had major injuries has a higher pain tolerance than someone who does not experience chronic pain and/or has not had any major injuries. \n\nI have chronic back pain, along with arthritis and fibromyalgia… along with ocular migraines (which cause me to lose my vision). I don’t remember the last time my body was pain free. I’ve had knee realignment surgery, gallbladder attack and remove, PCOS, countless uterine surgeries fractured and broken ribs… the only reason I mention these is my pain scale is drastically different than others. My pain scale is as such: \n1 - not bothersome but can go about my day \n2 - noticeable, made worse with movement but can go about my day\n3 - more noticeable, may have to take pain reliever, but able to function \n4 - taking pain reliever regularly to reduce pain, but can function; limited mobility \n5 - taking pain reliever regularly, can minimally function and do things that don’t aggravate pain\n6 - cannot function normally (daily tasks, watch tv, sleep, etc) and would require taking off work for recovery\n7 - cannot move at all, cannot function (eat, sleep, or drink) and requires doctor visit, possibly ER.\n8+ do not know as I never used any numbers higher than 7. \n\nFor reference: Fracturing my ribs and a couple migraines were 7s. I ended up going to urgent care for both only to be redirected to the emergency room. \n\nAll this nonsense regarding my pain scale is relative for the fact that pain scales are a spectrum and it’s hard to confine pain to a number. Pain is relative only to the pain you’ve experienced, so if you fall and sprain your ankle it might be the worst pain you’ve ever experienced compared to someone who’s broken ribs. \n\nSo, some people look at my pain scale and shift it around and their 10 is my 5, or their 5 is my 10. Thus, having agreed upon definitions is important. The reasoning for my scale and the way it is, is as someone who’s chronically ill, I don’t want to use the higher numbers as a base line in case I experience worse pain. But that is *my* personal preference and reasoning.\n\nIf someone’s worst pain in their life is a 10 and that’s not what you call a 10, doesn’t mean their pain isn’t bad or invalid. Yeah, it’s annoying but everything’s relative.",

He referred me to a piece of my medical history indicating I had a history of drug abuse. Yeah, I once told a Dr I smoked weed while in college, 40+ years ago. She put it in my medical records. The PA tells me any subsequent Dr reading that immediately thinks I am there for opioids. Then it all made sense. I reflected back on some very short Dr appointments and the general tone taken when discussing my condition. I never once asked a Dr for pain meds. However, prior to the neurosurgeon who operated on me every Dr told me pains meds were out of the question and I was summarily dismissed. Apparently, opioids are only prescribed to people at EOL. For my sciatic issues I received cortisone injections in my left hip 3 days ago. The shots prior to surgery lasted 2 weeks each time. These are $1600 a pop.

My parents were horrified when I took off my shoe and asked if that was normal, and immediately rushed me to a foot doctor. The doctor was shocked and horrified that I'd been calmly walking on it, and said I should have been screaming in agony or crying from pain. I honestly told him \"it's not the worst pain I've dealt with\". \n\nWhen a huge cyst that had been wrapped around my ovary exploded, I calmly drove myself to the hospital and joked around with the nurse to distract myself from the pain. The nurses and doctors assumed I was faking to get pain meds because I was so calm even though I rated my pain at a 8-10 and told me to get up and go home, and stop wasting their time (they literally said these exact words). When I stood up I instantly collapsed and lost consciousness. When I woke up I was being rushed to get multiple scans and they were pumping meds into me while several nurses and doctors were yelling in the background. Apparently my body was actually in shock because of trauma to my ovary and the organs surrounding it, and they needed to stabilize me immediately. The person who did the 3rd scan (a ultrasound to see the damage) told me that the amount of pain I was experiencing was worse than giving birth with no pain meds and said they couldn't figure out why I wasn't screaming in agony nonstop. I just casually shrugged and replied \"when you've had chronic pain 24/7 for your whole life, you get used to it\".",

I went to the bathroom as normal.  Didn't feel done but nothing else was coming out. I continued with my morning routine and now 5 minutes later I had to go again. I went and felt like I was done this time. \n\nI'm now ready to walk out the door but now it feels like I have to poop. I try to go and nothing. There's this really dull pain starting to pulse. Now I'm at work and I feel like I gotta poop again (and I'm a shy pooper so this was terrible news for me). Again nothing. The pain starts to radiate a bit more.\n\nI go to my boss and say I think something isnt right and I need to go to the doctor. (I have no idea what a kidney stone feels like or whats going on at this point). It's just after 7 am and I'm heading to my routine doctor's office. I walk in and they are on limited staff due to the \"holiday\". I tell them my symptoms and they ask me to pee in a cup. Not 3 minutes later the nurse comes into the waiting room, they don't have patients scheduled today and she tells me there is a lot of blood iny pee.\n\nAt this point I thought well if there's blood in your pee it's gotta be noticeable. Negative. She said to go to the E.R. and asked if I could drive. I sped down to the E.R. and thats when the pain REALLY kicked in. I had to stick to the fetal position and rock myself. Not knowing if I was going to pissyself or if it was one of the 100 earlier false alarms.\n\nI was in the waiting room for close to an hour before I got called back and they did an ultrasound and said it just started it's journey and that they'd put me on morphine for the pain.\n\nUntil I got that morphine I was writhing around in pain there was no escaping it, there was no position that eased it, it was just pure 100% pain. I threw up from the pain. This is just the going from the kidney to the bladder part. I thankfully never had to pass it.\n\nThe doctor told me two things that day. First, it was a smaller kidney stone, some are larger and need to be broken up into pieces! Second, once you have one kidney stone your prone to more. I've been scared of every minor back ache ever since and have been drinking water like a fish. \n\ntl;dr - Kidney stones SUCK. Worst pain in my life.",

Even had one uncle throw up in my car because he was in such excruciating pain.\n\nWhat I have first hand experience in though is a bad toothache.  Back of the jaw molar pain to be more accurate.  I don’t ignore my dental hygiene, but I guess I was not as diligent as I should have been.  Especially when it came to regular dentist visits and flossing.  In any case, that lackadaisical attitude caused a cavity on two of my very rear molars to become abscessed.  Over time I got progressively worse.  Until one day I’m enjoying some time with the family.  Decided we wanted to go eat subs.  Took my first bite of that delicious looking sandwich with wild abandon.  \n\nThe pain that shot through my jaw, neck, and soul was life altering.  A delicious deep throb that was all encompassing.  There was nothing but pain.  Everything else ceased to exist. It was to the extent that I begged and pleaded to be driven to the nearest emergency room.  \n\nFunny thing about emergency medical services, there’s no such thing as an emergency room dentist.  Maybe in large metropolitan areas such an animal exists.  Alas, as the area of my current residence is neither large nor metropolitan, I was left lying in a very nice room, on a very nice gurney with a very nice PA looking down at me with abject sympathy/sorrow letting me know that the best they could do was to give me pain killers.  Direct intervention to resolve the issue (two root canals) would have to wait until I was in front of an actual dentist.  I begged this woman for relief.  If not from the pain then from life itself.  This happened on a Saturday night.  The prospects of going 36 HOURS! without remedy seemed insurmountable.  \n\nI was set up with an IV, which I did not feel when inserted.  And finally a few elongated minutes later the pain meds where applied.  That wondrous drug filled me with warmth and joy.  Snow day off school, white Christmas morning with presents, new puppy day kinda joy and warmth. I believe they gave me delotid.  What ever it was, it was downright magical.  \n\nI had never really experienced 10/10 pain before that day.  I had broken bones in my wrist and hand, had sprained ankles, had been kicked in the gonads, hit my melon on very hard (concrete) surfaces.  But this pain…. This pain was something else altogether.  \n\nI was able to get in front of a dentist that Monday.  The abscess was cleaned out and more pain meds weee administered.  A few days later the root canals were completed without any complications.\n\nI now have a point of reference for real 10/10 pain.",

Twice so far. \n\nOut of all the pains I’ve felt - INCLUDING kidney stones 1 my 10 is still getting a cavity drilled at a dentist without numbing. At like age 10. I still have nightmares about it. In the nightmares I’m chewing gum that I have to rip out of cavities, which the pain of doing so feels like the pain when my teeth were drilled. \n\nThe memory of that pain is so visceral that I genuinely can’t even chew gum anymore, because my dreams have made me associate gum with that level 10 pain.

However, we ask them to describe the pain such as how it feels (burning, punching, tearing, etc.), location, how often is it (constant, intermittent, only with movement, etc.), and what makes it better or worse. These are ways we can #1, assess whether the patient is actually in pain or if they are just looking for meds and #2, what the pain may be a symptom of.\n\nWe never would tell a patient they are faking it because that is a surefire way to get reported, even if we know they are faking it.

Not saying this is the only example, but I'm throwing it out there as an easy benchmark for people to understand who haven't had this kind of pain.\n\n**Truthfully, I'm glad most haven't experienced this level of harm/ distress.** The question, as I hear it usually asked is, \"If 10 is the worst pain you can imagine, what is your pain?\" Usually, healthcare workers don't have 30+ min to walk through how this scale is supposed to be used, and come to common terms on definitions and the like.  So, staff just take the answer and go from there.\n\n**Maybe a stubbed toe is the worst pain you have experienced in your life, and thus, this is a \"10\" to you, but not to us. I get it.  Also other factors, like stress/ anxiety, can make the pain worse**.  Say you have the best day of your life, hit the jackpot on the lottery, met the perfect person and they said yes, and landed the perfect job, etc.  Then you walk in the door of your home, and stub your pinkie toe on the coffee table.  What number would someone give? It may be so minor you laugh it off, and keep going.\n\nOk.  Hold that thought.  Same scenario, but worse day: Learned that your partner is leaving you, they have racked up a hidden level of debt that will wipe out all of your assets, lost your job, walked in on your partner with your best friend, and then they backed over your dog on the way out. Then you stub your toe with the same degree of physical damage as the good day scenario? What would you rate your pain then? It may be the \"straw the broke the camels back/ foot\" Everything held up like a house of cards may collapse at this point, and you completely break down in tears. **The physical damage can be the same, but pain gait theory will change how your body feels the \"pain\" even if the physical damage is the same.**\n\n**TL;DR Read the bold text.**",

It lingered for what felt like an eternity. My body tensed up so much that I was dripping sweat within seconds. I'd call that a 10. It took me about a year maybe? Half a year?

Didn't come back again until 13 years later which was actually 2 months ago. Got cut open and drained 4 times before finally just getting surgery and my cleft reshaped to help prevent them.

If it’s 10+ then it’s 10+ - mind you,all your other obs will probably already reflect that!",

Didn’t think much of it. I was like “yeah, maybe it’s just not settling well.” So I take a nap. \n\nI wake up 2 hours later to an alarm. I was supposed to go eat food at my best friends house at 3pm when he got out of work, and it was 11am. My stomach was now in excruciating pain. I take some ibu and call my friend (he’s at work) to tell him I was gonna cancel. \n\nHe thinks I’m lying to get out of our early dinner plans. His girlfriend was a nurse at our facility, so he calls her on the phone and tells her my symptoms. 5 minutes later my friend calls me back and says “fuck work. I told them I’m leaving. I’ll be there in 10 minutes.” In that 10 minute span my pain levels had sky rocketed. I’m now curled in a weird position, sweating, shaking and in an altered mental status. \n\nMy friend comes pulling into the driveway. Walks straight in without knocking and says “dude let’s go.” I’m confused and cannot walk. This big ass mother fucker picks me up like a baby and cradles me, walking me to the car. He lays the passenger seat down and gently places me in it. \n\nFor the entirety of the drive, I’m hallucinating and squirming in the seat. He has his hands on me. Romantic as fuck. God damn he’s my best friend. What a good dude. Anyway. He speeds all the way to the hospital. Emergency lights on and all. He’s really dramatic.\n\nHe proceeds to park in the ER, and carry’s me inside. They then hook me up to several machines and begin tests. They assumed (and betted on) kidney stones. Eventually, I’m screaming and moaning and grunting and they decide to give me morphine. It honestly took them about an hour to do so. I thought I was dying and was legit hallucinating the entire time. It was the definition of suck. I’m a veteran, was a corrections officer and practice MMA. This was by far the worst pain I’d experienced in all of those shitty, physical careers. \n\nEventually, they realize it’s my appendix. How they realized it? I felt this weird movement in my stomach. Felt like gas. Then, relief! I felt great! They didn’t think this was cool at all. I’m happy, they’re now terrified. They proceed to dump drugs into that IV. Benzo’s, more morphine. I was relieved of all pain and now on cloud 9. So fucking high! I was in heaven. \n\nThe make me count backward, I was so confused I didn’t know what was happening. I wake up some time later with a puffed up belly and stitches all over. My appendix had bursted in the hospital. \n\nSo anyway. Ben. You’re my best friend and I love you dude. Fucking amazing friend. He got in trouble for leaving work that day. But he very well may have saved my life. I was at an 8/10 when he got me but I fully planned to sleep it off. His wife, Sylver, is a GOAT too. She knew by my symptoms what was happening. She caught it even though the docs and nurses in the ER didn’t. She told him he needed to leave and take me. The pain I felt in that empty hospital room? For sure, without a doubt, 10/10. Morphine took it to a 9.3/10. That shit sucked. Love you Ben.",

It is not a too invasive surgery, just you have to stay in bed for a week without moving only to pee, and you get prescribed tramadol and morphine for the pain that is going to last at least a month.\n\nBut 6 months ago, I had the worst pain I can ever describe in my life : kidney stones. The motherfucker basically started blasting through my left ureter, waking me up in the middle of the night, giving me only mild back pain for a while, and then my belly started aching like crazy. Thought I had intestinal occlusion, like the worst kind of shit that can get stuck. I called 911, aching on the scale of around 9/10 (I don't call 911 if I ache less, previous time was for a suicide attempt and the time before was because I woke up totally confused in a pool of my own blood). By the time the paramedics came, shit hurt even more, it was really difficult to get a response out of me, paramedics couldn't get my pulse because my tension was so low. I basically hoped I would faint so I couldn't feel the pain while I was unconscious. But I stayed awake. \n\nGot transported by ambulance to the closest clinic, they did some blood tests but I had a really hard time to understand what they were saying, the pain was just everything. My symptoms already said it was a kidney stone, so when they asked to rate my pain I said 10. They believed me, and only gave me a mild painkiller. I was just trembling and shaking and turning in the hospital bed, until it was too unbearable and without even realizing it I screamed \"someone please help me please kill me.\" Nurse came through, saw the state I was in, and finally gave me morphine, 3 hours after I started aching in my own bed.\n\nPain stopped in approx. 10 minutes. I was dumbfounded. I could think again, I could move and send messages to my friends who were worrying. Doctors told me to do a renal scan, and let me off. I was so hyped up by the *lack* of pain that I just walked fast for 2 miles to get a bus.\n\nNow, about the surgery scheduled for next month? I'm not scared anymore. Shit was the worst pain I ever felt in my life. A month at 7 or 8 on the scale is pretty much nothing compared to what I lived in only a few hours. It was a strange life lesson. I'm not scared about pain anymore.",

They hooked me up and said I was having contractions. They obviously didn’t ask me a pain scale. But I was just like eh. Don’t really feel It. They were monitoring me for the bleeding. Well being my first baby and me saying I didn’t feel much was dumb. Honest. But dumb. They left me  alone for a few hours and when they came back in I told them contractions really picked up. I was crowning. Cue fetal ejection and my baby getting held in for a doctor to arrive and 5 other nurses flying in the room. Lol sometimes a 10 for one person is a 5 for someone else. And the nurses had no clue. Precipitous labor and a high pain tolerance can put you in a weird predicament.",

            "text": "My Mom had severe pain, constant severe pain in her body for over a year, she kept telling the doctor it was like an 8 or 9, basically it was high. She gave birth to 2 kids and in her head she was comparing it to that, no doctor was taking it seriously, in fact they treated her as if she was just trying to get drugs or something like that. (I I swear on my life my mother has never been that type of person) She died later that year with no one taking her seriously from stage 4 cancer in 3-4 different places (I believe it was the liver, heart and somewhere in the stomach.) Also it really feels like no one ever takes a woman pain seriously. Screw the pain scale. If you want to tell someone a number they’re likely at then tell them to increase it as it gets worse then do that, otherwise patients will just assume your pain scale is meant to be a scale of 1 being the slightest pain you’ve ever felt in your life and 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever felt in your life. So if someone is saying 10 maybe it’s because ITS THE WORST PAIN THEY’VE EVER FELT IN THEIR LIFE AND THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG.\n\n(You know the pain is bad when the patient literally signs a DNR… and all that accomplished was them moving her to hospice and keeping her asleep with something I can’t remember the name of… starts with an M… I miss my mom I hope to see her again if such a thing is even possible. Please don’t look at this as someone being rude about a method that usually works. This is just someone who is annoyed to lose their best friend, hero, only parent and teacher/mentor due to a possible thing like people saying 10+ pain (which then causes them not being taken seriously.)

            "text": "So, last March (2021) I came home from work and felt ‘odd.’ At first I thought perhaps it was anxiety. I’ve suffered with this and depression for many years so thought I knew my ‘MO’!’ Anyway, this time something was different and even now I can’t explain what/why/how; it just was.\n\nI decided to go to bed but couldn’t settle and instead drove myself to our local Urgent Care Centre (UCC). I asked my partner if he wanted to come with me but agreed I would be told it was anxiety (just presenting itself in a new manner) and we’d both end up shattered for work in the morning (he had to be up at 05.30.)\n\nI got to the UCC and after informing reception that I thought it was anxiety I ‘did my time’ in the waiting area until I was called to see a doctor.\n\nHe (the doctor) asked me in an open area (as in - other patients/staff could not just hear us but see the conversation unfold) what symptoms I was experiencing and I really hadn’t got beyond ‘I’m just not right.’ However, once I was asked to clarify this I explained that I felt as though I had a blood pressure cuff wrapped around my arms and chest, the pressure not just squeezing but, crushing me; that someone was kneeling (on one knee) on my chest bone.\n\nThe following is pretty much a direct replica of our conversation:\nHim: What? You’re feeling this now? Right now???\nMe: Yes\nHim: And what level of pain would you say you’re in, out of 10?\nMe: about an 8\nHim: You know that 10/10 would be childbirth?\nMe: Well, I’ve never given birth…\nHim: Glaring…\nMe: I’ll tell you what; you tell me what level of pain I’m in and we’ll just go with that shall we???\nAnd then the curtains closed…\n\nIt turns out that there is a difference between a heart attack and a cardiac arrest; I managed 3 of each; apparently the last one, (which involved me having 6 stents inserted, lasted for over 10 minutes - I was definitely a dead parrot I was “no more”\n\nWhat I’m trying to convey is how subjective and irrelevant a number can be in terms of measuring pain. The nurse who explained that it is a useful tool to assess a patient’s presentation was absolutely bang on. It’s so sad that some health care professionals are naive to this and believe that they he scale is objective",
