    "LPT: Instead of trying to kill a fly by hitting it, spray it with water\nDuring the summer my house gets filled up with flies because my kids are always running in and out of the house. So I carry a spray bottle around with me. The minute I see a fly in my peripheral vision or if it lands on something I spray it. The fly can’t see the water coming the way it would see my hand or a flyswatter coming. Once it gets wet it’s wings don’t work anymore and eventually it will fall. That’s when you squish it. Works every time.": [

If the fly is stationary, place both your hands at the side of the fly about 10 inches away. Cup your hands. Close your hands really quickly above the fly, since you are predicting it's movements. This method is 100% effective. The only downside is crushing the sucker when closing your hands, but if you catch them alive, just shake your hands violently and then slam the fly on the floor. \n\n2. While flying. A fly ages everyday. I think their lifespan is around 20-30 days. But the older they get, the more sluggish they get. When this happens, a simple slap while they are flying is effective, or if you want to get cocky, you can catch them with one hand. \n\n3. Get the fly high off cannabis by blowing second smoke on it. Got this from a Joe Cartoon, and it actually fucking works. The flies will not fly as much, and will resort to walking if the effects are too much.",
