Mom has zero friends and tells her she only wants a relationship with her forever. \n\nNow that's she's 18 and in another town at college, we are building a great relationship with her and really helping her learn healthier behaviors.  At first she would use this contact as ammunition to hurt her mother when they get in a fight.. which makes it difficult for everyone.  \n\nShe doesn't have to tell her about how great we are and how much she loves me and is listening to my advice when she knows she can't handle it.
