Children do not need to know there is a world of problems.

My point is that children should never be treated like adults. Even though we may think we're helping them we're not taking directly into account their stage of brain development. You could end up inadvertently doing more harm than good, even though your heart is in the right place.",

If you keep doing that, you'll fall and hit your head or something. That probably would hurt, would it? You also may cry if you're hurt, and you don't wanna feel hurt and sad do you?\" Eventually it would turn into \"well you wouldn't want to break your arm and go to the hospital would you?\" when she started watching Doc McStuffins\n\nI did this in other parts of her life; ex. \"why did mom take away my toy?\" \"well you didn't listen to her when she asked you to pick up your plate. Maybe if you pick it up and say sorry maybe she will give it back?\" \n\nI know that when I was also a small, I hated to follow my parents' rules without an explanation. She didn't put two and two together or realize that consequences have potentially bad actions. When her younger brother was the same age & would jump on the couch, she would tell him no then explain to him that he would hurt and cry.

Do you really want to read all that crap? That's why *we* have TLDR, so think of anything you say to a kid as a TLDR.  \n\n\n**Lecturing is** ***pointless*****.** Droning on and on and on and on just bores them silly, and after 10 seconds they start staring out the window & fidgeting, so keep any information & message short and on point.\n\n**Keep it entertaining.** If you're trying to get a point across about 'stranger danger' for example, ask them what they already know, have they talked about this in school or with their friends. Ask them what they think about it, and *LISTEN*. Don't interrupt, do ask them simple questions, 'have you ever been scared?' Let them talk. Don't accept grunts and one word answers.  \n\n\n**Actually talk** ***with*** **your kids, NOT AT them.** Engage the conversation & ask questions and listen to their answers and never ever ever criticize them or call them stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Never call your kid names and**  ***don't let them call each other names*****.** If Big Brother is calling Little Sister 'stupid', nip that in the bud. I know they get it from the unwashed heathens at school, but don't allow that shit in your house.    \n\n\nAn important point to make with siblings, especially with older ones picking on little ones, is to say \"she's not stupid, she knows just as much as you did when she was your age. Were you stupid when you were 7?\"  \n\n\n**Name calling is just not allowed, ever.** It's a bad lifelong habit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your kid does indeed do something stupid, because, we all do, don't call the kid \"stupid\". Instead, call the action \"stupid\".  \n\n\nOh fuck, little Leroy just dented the new garage door with his basketball. The little shit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Leroy, why in *hell* did you do a stupid thing like that????? Just wait 'til your other mother gets home, she's gonna kill you.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCriticize the action without calling the kid names.

The election was of course the topic of conversation at mealtimes. I had 4th graders (9 to 10yo) (90% Latino), telling me they were afraid and worried about their relatives being jailed, deported or beaten if Trump won. Of being put into foster care or even detention. Teachers reported even the kindergareners were exhibiting anxiety.\nKids arent dumb folks",

How to get food? Also learned/taught survival skill. \n\nBut the depth of emotional complexity doesn‚Äôt change, it‚Äôs simply the case that some (most? Many) adults avoid depth their whole life until some crisis when they turn and go ‚ÄúWhy in Heaven‚Äôs name is our society so incapable of discussing the basics of emotions?!?‚Äù Or perhaps a more subtle ‚ÄúI never asked myself these questions before! I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have to, but now it‚Äôs changed,‚Äù which can be said with excitement or dread depending. \n\nEspecially when you‚Äôre around kids who were talked to always, as ‚Äúif‚Äù adults and always when they‚Äôre in the room (never the caretaker going ‚Äúso-and-so is this-and-that,‚Äù as if the child weren‚Äôt there, but instead saying ‚Äúso-and-so, do you want to tell them about this-and-that?‚Äù because they‚Äôre not on the other side of some Seen And Not Heard attention-neglectful wall that the kid then needs to climb over to enter the conversation like ‚Äúhey! Hey!‚Äù Not even thinking it‚Äôs an option to speak for themselves about themselves, let alone in their own way. A lot of us were trained to recite a script and leave quietly. Which is fine, until you‚Äôre an adult and you still don‚Äôt know what you need or want to say in most situations, like many of us).\n\nKids need people to talk to, freely, as themselves, no judgment. That‚Äôs the most important work we can do to heal the world.\n\nTL;DR Putting my 2 cents out there that depth doesn‚Äôt increase over your life, it‚Äôs just environment that invites, encourages, or discourages more often the awareness of this depth and ability to express it. \n\nBonus 2 cents ‚Äî I think overly fascist colonizer cultures intend to squeeze as much sensitive/emotional awareness out of daily life possible, with fear and paranoia and strictness and invisible walls between people, so emotional depth is non existent BUT FOR the profound depth natural in young people.",
