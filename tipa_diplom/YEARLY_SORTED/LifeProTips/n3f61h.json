    "LPT- Don't tell scammers that you have a Dash Cam.\nIf someone tries to scam you while you are driving a vehicle, do not inform the scammer that you have a dashcam. They will just leave the scene immediately. Instead, just call the police. Do not exchange insurance info without police present. When the police arrive, allow them to get a statement from the \"victim.\" When they come to you for a statement, show them your dashcam footage. Falsifying a police statement is illegal, and they will not only be caught red handed scamming someone, but their charges will be more severe for falsifying a statement. Plus if they are in a vehicle when they tried to scam you, their insurance premiums will probably go through the roof. Remember, if they tried to scam you, they have tried to scam someone else, and are likely going to continue trying to scam others in the future. Let's stop allowing them to get away with it so easily.\n\nUpdate: Lots of really good discussion. Plenty of people who think my LPT is crap, and that's fine! Happy to see people having good discussions and sharing their own experiences, and how/why this LPT might not be good advice for people in their areas. \n\nAlso, lots of questions on what dashcam to purchase and how they work. I got a $45 dollar dashcam from Amazon. It had pretty good reviews, which is what I look for in a product. They come with a memory card, which stores the video as your drive. When the card gets full, it should automatically delete the oldest video's to fit the new videos. If an accident occurs, your pull the memory card and plug into your computer to save the video you want. The dashcam plugs into your vehicles cigarette lighter. As far as I know, no dashcam records multiple viewpoints. You will need to purchase more than one dashcam if you want front, rear, and side facing dashcams. Hopefully this helps to address some of the questions I have seen.\n\nUpdate #2: someone says  dash cams that record multiple angles at once do exist. I didn’t know this, but great info! The commenter couldn’t remember the brand but I am sure someone can give more info.": [

If you live in a two party consent state, then you should turn off microphone recording on your dash cam (which it should have the feature to do since they know about these laws). Illegally obtained evidence isn't admissible in court, so make sure your footage is in a format that will be most useful to you when need be.\n\nSome argue that you should have the microphone on regardless and that if you need to submit the footage to court you should just submit the video only.

I had my wife and two kids in the car with me, so I didn't want to escalate the situation.  I pointed towards my car and told him that I had a dash cam that had not only recorded him pulling out into traffic and causing the accident, but also of him acting like a buffoon.  I lied, I didn't have a dash cam, but my wife was recording him on her primitive mid 2000's flip phone from the passenger seat.  The blood drained out of his face, and he promptly turned around and jumped back into his car and drove off like a moron.  Well the cops came and took a report.  I had noted his license plate, so they had him.  Turns out he was in a rental, so the rental car company's insurance paid out to repair my car, but also provided the police his information.  Since there is a military base nearby, and he was most likely associated with it, I took all of the information I got from the police and the insurance company and turned it over the military police on base.

I think it was stalled or something since the driver put it into park. Anyway, I didn't quite have enough room to go around it so I slid backwards then went around it. My place was half a block behind the stalled car. As I pulled into the parking garage a car tailgated in behind me. I didn't recognize the car (it's a small garage, maybe 20 cars) and I recognized most of them. As soon as I park this guy runs out of his car, full aggro, screaming that I had hit his car.\n\n(note, most of this conversation is paraphrased as this happened a few years ago but it's close enough)\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"When you slid back! You hit my car than you tried to get away!!\"\n\n\"You mean when I backed up to go around the stalled car?\"\n\n\"That's illegal!\"\n\n\"What's illegal?\"\n\n\"Crossing a solid yellow line!!\"\n\n\"Are you mad at me for hitting you or mad that I crossed the yellow line to get around a stalled car? Also, show me where I hit your car.\"\n\nSo we walk over to his car and he points at his bumper.\n\n\"I don't see any damage.\"\n\n\"It's right there!\"\n\nI want to note, he's constantly yelling. And my wife has now rolled her eyes straight out of her head and has headed over to the elevators. And, I genuinely didn't see any damage. I'm also pretty sure I didn't hit him. My car has a rear cam and when I reversed there was a few inches between my back bumper and his front bumper before I pulled away.\n\n\"I can hear you just fine, calm down. I don't see any damage. What do you want?\"\n\n\"I'm going to call the police on you.\"\n\n\"Ok, that's fine, but do it outside, you're on private property.\"\n\n\"You don't own this building!\"\n\n\"I... what? It's private property, go park on the street and call the cops if you must.\"\n\n\"If I leave then you'll leave!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I'm not leaving then!\"\n\n\"Ok, well, call the cops then.\"\n\nSo he tries but there's no signal *in the underground garage*.\n\n\"I don't have a signal.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ok so you have to come with me.\"\n\n\"Naw.\"\n\n\"Then I'm not leaving.\"\n\n\"I mean, suit yourself, but if I leave you can't get out. The door requires a remote or a key to operate. You can leave by the stairs but you won't be able to drive out without someone letting you out. I'm offering to let you out now. \"\n\nAt this point one of my neighbors exited the elevator and came over to find out what was going on since buddy was still pretty yelly. I explained to her what happened while he did alot of loud interjecting.\n\n\"Sir, you're trespassing. If you don't leave I'll call the police myself.\"\n\n\"You don't own this building!\"\n\nShe gave me this look like, \"What is wrong with this guy?\" and then went to her car and drove out.\n\nWe went back and forth a bit because, for whatever reason, he couldn't figure his way out of this conundrum. Eventually I just said I'd wait on the sidewalk for the police because, at this point, I was committed to seeing how this would turn out.\n\nSo we walk to the door, I open it, he steps just outside so he can get a signal and calls the police. His car is still in the garage.\n\n*Weirdly*, a police car pulls up like 5 minutes later. I swear, this is the fastest I've ever seen a car arrive. The cops ask what happened and buddy tells them I hit them and then did a hit and run. They ask where the cars are and he says that they're in the garage. \n\n\"Both of them?\"\n\n\"Yeah, he followed me into the garage to confront me.\"\n\n\"What kind of damage?\"\n\n\"Ask him\", I said nodding at buddy.\n\n\"What kind of damage?\"\n\n\"Let me show you.\"\n\nSo we walked back to the garage. The cops examined both cars. \n\n\"I don't see any damage.\"\n\n\"I didn't hit him but he thinks I did. Also he's trespassing. I've asked him several times to move his car outside. So has my neighbor. He's blocking several tenants with his car.\"\n\n\"Sir, you're trespassing, you need to leave.\"\n\n\"He doesn't own the building!\"\n\nI swear.\n\nAnyway, they eventually convinced him to leave, apologized to me, and I went upstairs. \n\nBecause I park my car ass in, the cam caught about half of this interaction.

When she finally came to a stop, I threw on my hazard lights and went to go and check on her since I wasn't hurt and I was worried something was wrong with her that caused her to hit me, and the first thing that POS said to me was: *\"What the hell?! You didn't see me turning?!\"*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**MADAM, YOU DROVE INTO *MY* CAR THAT WAS AT A FULL STOP!**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI called the cops for documentation, and since there weren't any witnesses, they said it was my burden of proof to show the insurance companies I wasn't at fault. So I sat my happy ass down at the impact site, took videos and pics of the impact site, the debris of my (and her) car in the road, and for good measure took TEN videos of people cutting that turn too closely from the main road to illustrate that with the other evidence, she was at fault.\n\n\n\n\nI'll never forget her being pissed AT ME because she hit MY car. I was involved in 2 more car accidents (which I wasn't at fault for) after that and I can barely stand to drive anymore, I'm so worried about other drivers. I still have yet to buy dash-cams but they can be invaluable for liability claims. \n\n\nAs much as I don't want to have a video of me loudly (and poorly) singing in my car, dash cams would have saved me a lot of headache in the long run",

The more that it can see and be able to make out things like plate numbers the better. A $45 cam may be able to show a red Civic side swiped you and sped off in the car lane, but a good dash cam should be able to show you the plate if it comes into the field of view.\n\nBe sure to check low-light and night performance.\n\nAlso don't handicap you dash cam with a cheap SD card, get a large one that is rated for constant video recording, preferably also rated for extremes in temperature (proper cards marketed at dash cams as re usually this combo).",

I went to court where the officer gave his statement first then I gave my statement and showed my video.

Since this was a car I bought new, I had the front end clear bra wrapped and ceramic coated all with less than 500 miles but this was done aftermarket. I brought the car in for the 10k service and specifically stated no car wash which was put on the service ticket and a sign placed on the dash. When I picked up the car and inspected it I found that they had chipped around lug nuts when they did the tire rotation. After talking to the dealer they agreed to fix it, they then called me few days later to pick it up and I checked it again and they basically just used touch up paint over the chips but the chips were still there. After back and forth I got them to replace the wheels with new but I had to leave the car with them. Here is where the dash cam comes in when I pickup the car for the last time it was a sunny/ over cast day and as I was walking up to it I noticed a ton of swirls all over the hood and side of the car and instantly knew what had happened. When I spoke with the dealer they assured me it was never washed while in their care. turned on the car, logged into the wireless of the dashcam and looked through the footage only to find the same manager who said it was not washed inside the car running through the car wash. Not only that, but I have audio recording turned on and it turns out they were talking shit about me while they were running it through the car wash. Long story short, the wheels and service were covered and I have not been back to the dealership. \n\nIve got the Blackvue DR-650s and Ive got it mounted right behind the rear view so you couldnt see it unless its pointed out. I work downtown and park in a public parking garage and as such that is the main reason I have the dash cam. When parked its connecting to a local Wifi so I get notifications.",

Normal cards will die due to overwriting within a year. Flash memory cells have a finite amount of writes to each cell before it becomes corrupted and fails. High Endurance cards use a type of flash memory that has a higher write count than current cheaper cards. You sacrifice memory capacity for high write counts.

Most dash cams come with a stealth mode that turns off the blinking camera light, or a piece of electrical tape works as well. If it's safe to do so, leave the car on so it can keep recording longer. Try to have any interactions with the other party in front of your car/camera.\n\nBut \"high endurance\" SD cards for your dash cam as they are designed to sustain more writing/rewriting than normal cards.

How do you reconcile having a dashcam with being a person that generally drives over the speed limit everywhere?

Because in a place like Chicago or Atlanta, if you're not doing 15-20 over the limit on a highway, your in people's way.  \n\n\nTl;dr:Are there legal concerns to turning over dashcam footage of an accident if you were speeding at the time, even if it's in all other ways clearly the other person's fault?",

You don't need to have cloud sub, you can put a 256GB mSD card to let loop over and over, the mount comes with spare metal/adhesive for the windshield (incase you have two cars and can easily move). Do not get the suction cup mounts, as with thermal changes, the mount could cause detachment while driving, and cause other issue. Its also so small, it can go behind the rearview and out of your sight.\n\nSome Logitech dashcams allow multiple cameras (front/back/sides) and an app. \n\nNote the power you connect to: some USB and cig/power sockets are always on or keyed. Always on is good for \"camera's with shock-recording incase parked and hit\" but can also drain the battery.

            "text": "I had a woman try to say I rear ended her intentionally and that I had been following her for 45 minutes, and claimed her back was severely injured. In reality she decided to go from the far left lane, across 4 lanes of traffic, to the far right lane. And when she did that, she slid across my front bumper and spun out. When the cops arrived, they asked her what happened and she lied. I asked her 3 times in front of the cops if she was sure that's what happened. She said yes, so I asked the officers if I could talk to them away from her, and showed them the dashcam footage. The cops look visibly annoyed because of her lying to their faces, and go over and start talking to her. She started screaming at them, saying that they must have taken a bribe from me since they were writing her tickets. Then the cop just said \"ma'am, the guy you're trying to milk money out of has a dashcam, and we watched the video twice, you are at fault\". Suddenly her back feels fine and she gets all \"oh I must have been mistaken\". The funny part? The police noticed a bottle of xanax in her front seat and asked her if she had taken any that day. She said she took one at 8 a.m. (the accident occurred at 9:30 a.m.) you should have seen her confusion when they tell her to put her hands behind her back, because she was being arrested for drug D.U.I. Her insurance was kinda desperate for me not to file a lawsuit, because they called me within 5 hours and asked if I'd be willing to accept full repair of my car, and $3500 for (unforseen expenses related to the accident). I hadn't even planned to file a lawsuit so I said sure. They hand delivered the check to me within 24 hours, which was very surprising. I know I could have probably gotten more if I sued, but I didn't feel like dealing with all that. If I hadn't had that dashcam, iv definitely would've been considered at fault. That $55 I spent on the dashcam paid for itself 1000x over in one day.",
