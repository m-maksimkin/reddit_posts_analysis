    "LPT: Make it a rule for yourself to NEVER insult how another person finds joy or expresses joy\nI.e their hobbies and their smile. It’s incredibly sad when some covers their mouth or face in the middle of a joyous moment because they were always told that the gap in their teeth looks weird or that they have an overbite.\n\nIn addition, seeing people never share anything about what makes them happy because their parents or their peers always tell them that their hobby of painting and collecting figurines is lame and childish.\n\nThis is one of the times that you should just keep that opinion to yourself\n\nEdit: Christ on a bike, if someone derives joy to the detriment of others you call them out, if it’s illegal you call a cop.": [

So, I aimed to try and find things to appreciate about the Beatles before i saw him again. I watched the Beatles documentary, watched interviews, tracked their influence, and listened to a substantial amount of their catalogue looking for songs I liked. \n\nThe next time I saw him, I apologized for spoiling the conversation last time with my lack of appreciation. Then I told him all the things I learned that I now appreciated about the Beatles and their contribution to music, I told him which songs I liked the most, then I gave him some Beatles playing cards I found as token of appreciation and no hard feelings. \n\nY'all, he was so into it. You should've seen him smiling sunbeams. He loved the discussion and he loved the cards and he was so excited to show them to people and talk about it. It really made me happy down to my core to share that appreciation and joy in that moment with him.\n\nLong story short, a little appreciation for other's interests goes a long way.

Lik, it’s all he listens to and gatekeeps it to the point I can’t make a comment about it. They talk about some pretty fucked up shit that I don’t even think they were saying literally but he takes it as literal. He won’t be open to anything new and has straight up gotten into huge fights with me if I say something critical about the music or artist. For example I think Xxxtentacion was kind of a shitty person. He did horrible things and committed heinous crimes but whenever I say this he tells me I don’t know wtf I’m talking about cus X was changing himself and that those things never happened and they are hearsay cus he wasn’t charged, I.e. threatening his pregnant girlfriend. I feel like these Artists are talented and some songs are worth listening to but to idolize these young men who either killed themselves by ODing or attempted to kill other people are not men to be idolized. I think it’s sad… but literally these 3 artists are the only things that bring him real joy. For the most part I say nothing but it’s definitely affecting me negatively. So I guess my point is that some people can turn something into an obsession which becomes unhealthy. We are currently in couples therapy and this is something I’m eventually going to bring up for him to work on. ￼",

Others have pointed out that sometimes people's joy harms others, but once again **it's not that black and white**. Question people who still listen to Chris Brown, or otherwise support famous people who maybe they shouldn't. Question internet artists who romanticize rape or unhealthy body images.

All of this was admittedly weird for suburban America in the 90s but the reactions I received when I told people what I did with my free time was so disappointing I shut down and really only engaged with small talk for years. \n\nWhen I got married my wife was blown away that I had zero hobbies, she has an endless list of arts and crafts projects and couldn't conceive of living without something to work on.

Some expressed curiosity and asked me to show what I liked about it, then they just say \"eh, it's not for me\". Totally understandable. Unfortunately, this type of experience is the less frequent. \n\nWhat usually happens is, they comment how I'm listening to songs where I don't understand the language. One of the individuals who said this, can't read or understand a single paragraph of English, yet listens to English songs everyday and enjoys it, but for some reason he doesn't understand how can I enjoy Korean music. I've been told (by men and women) that most Korean actors or singers look gay because of how much make up they use, which ended up meaning I was into guys who used make up. Welp.\n\nWhen it comes normal conversations between guys/friends, the topic of hot/beautiful women came one day, I made the mistake of telling them I find one Korean actress really beautiful...they said who and I showed them. \"ohh, you like china women\". As of that moment, I'm the guy that's into \"china women\".  \n\nNowadays, I don't exactly hide it, but I'll never mention it. I just got too tired of having to explain why I like something.

Just move on with your life if you dislike them so much. Common responses sound like \"Because I'm a REAL fan and I won't stand for this in MY Star Wars\" implying I'm not a real fan and only they have the criteria and authority to say who is. It's gatekeeping, and these are children's movies with a central message of \"Hatred is bad, be kind to others\". They completely miss the point. The comics and novels are the same. TFM act like everything published before 2012 was Shakespeare and everything after 2012 is Mien Kampf. They haven't even read the stuff, but act like it's holy writ. It's delusional.",

One of them picked up a single roll of paper towels and threw it at the other, I wanna say it was the parent to the kid? Anyway, they all started laughing and were tossing these rolls at each other before putting them in the cart and continuing on.\n\nI had my judgments based on how they looked. They looked ghetto. I’ve since learned not to judge on such trivial characteristics like someone’s looks, but I remember seeing that and thinking “look at these fucking idiots. Have some respect. Learn how to act in a fucking store/public place”. \n\nAnd immediately after I had that thought I had an epiphany. That I am judging them… but they looked so happy. Who am I to judge how a family goes on about their business and how they joke around and play with the kids. Why did their happiness upset me so much? I learned right then and there that I was the one who was wrong and if they’re not affecting me and not hurting anyone then it’s none of my business. Tough lesson for anyone to accept but also tough to manage. We’re all human and we’re guilty of things like that from time to time. But we should work on practicing that kind of awareness.

            "text": "This will get buried probably but here goes; I love food and eating food. I'm a chef and I have a passion for food. My happy place is the dinner table, bonus points if I'm with loved ones. My entire life I've never once heard someone tell me I was a loud eater as far as I can remember, like literally not once. Then when I was 27 I began dating my ex, the only person who's ever said anything about my eating. She herself had a lot of mental health issues due to a lot of fucked up shit being done to her by her family and ex husband. She had horrible self esteem, PTSD, anxiety, and many others. She'd have nightmares frequently and wake me up because she'd be freaking out and yelling in her sleep, like she was absolutely terrified. I'd comfort her as best as I could on those nights, and I altered anything and everything about my behavior and whatever else in order to prevent triggering her PTSD. Slowly built up her self esteem to a point where she told me she was genuinely content with her appearance for the first time. I took her in with open arms, baggage and all, and I fell more in love with her than I've ever been. I didn't see any of her habits, mental illness, scars, or stretch marks from having kids in her previous marriage as flaws. I didn't see them at all honestly, whatever she hated about herself, was what I loved the most.\n\nThis might sound dramatic but it seriously fucked me up over time. It started off with her making a comment here and there while we were eating. I chew with my mouth closed, I always have. I know for a FACT I chew with my mouth closed but she would randomly say, \"Babe chew with your mouth closed please.\" At first I thought that maybe I'd just smacked my lips or actually had my mouth open briefly and gave her the benefit of the doubt. Except after the first few times I would pay extra attention to myself just to be sure. Sure as shit once every couple days she would still say something. I felt attacked so I would try and tell her I know my mouth wasn't open and I believe she was mistaken, but she would always disagree. Over time it got less polite and eventually turned to, \"Close your mouth while you eat.\" Then sometimes she'd follow up with a comment about how gross it was. Then she started doing it in front of our friends, who never once validated her, but it really fucked with me, So when she'd say something about it I would just stop eating. Then she'd suddenly be apologizing and asking me to finish my food but I just couldn't after awhile because I became too self conscious. If I left the room I'd be able to finish eating but most of the time I just lost my appetite.\n\nAs the years went on it evolved into her straight faced commenting, \"You're SUCH a loud eater! I can hear you chewing from here it's so gross\" a few times she even said it was making her want to puke. I've never really been horribly self conscious about anything but this eating thing took the top spot for me and by a very large margin. We broke up a couple months ago and while it broke my heart like never before and I wished on anything I could to get her back, anytime I'm eating nowadays and there's people around, I can't help but slink down in my chair with my head low. I feel absolutely shameful and disgusting anytime I can hear myself eating or catch myself chewing at too high a tempo. I feel like everyone hears me eating but they're too nice to say anything. My happy place at the dinner table has turned into a nightmare anytime there are other people present.",

There where a few kids who had xbox 360s and played halo 3 all the time, I would over hear them talking about it. \n\nI also owned a 360 and played the same game, after a week weeks I finally decided to ask if I could join them, they wrote there gamertags down onto a paper. Long story short I opened my self up to a new friend group, I still play with these guys to this day. \n\nWell I also had a older brother who would make fun of the games I played which made no Sense to me as he owned a console but it was a Playstation. He would tell me how bad online games are, how terrible I perform, laught at me for playing alone, how terrible my console was/threaten to destroy it. And lost of other things I don't think I will ever forget. I didn't take games into a competitive state I did it for fun. \n\nIt took me a while to get back into games. I lost the hype for a new game, didn't really share my hobbies with others as I though they would just laugh and mock me for what I play. \n\nAnyway I have a younger brother and dad dad who got into gaming. And of course I made sure I didn't bash any game they played as I know what it felt like, and how it ruins others moods. We still play together mostly fps/coop xampaign games. Each day we share new information to each other such as update, new abilitys, weapon class setups etc. I get so excited to get home from work and join my friends/family in a few matches of what ever we decide to play. \n\nI will never forget that feeling of being embarrassed/scared to share thing I was interested into and never wish that upon anyone. I think people need to learn how to shut out the toxic people of the world and keep the positive people near you. In my experience it makes life so much happier/better.\n\nEDIT: one thing that bothers me the most is my little brother has a lisp, it's no problem to me. People always crap on him laughing at him, copying him and making him insecure about it. I felt so bad when I saw him crying as kids at school made fun of the way he talks. Speech therapy was something he attended in grade school via teachers advice and it didn't help, please respect other people you never know what they are going through and somethings are not \"fixable\" its who they are.",

My gf's kid (who I would normally just call my kid) was not raised very well before I got into the picture. His dad was a bum who only interacted or parented by sticking his kid on games and his mom was a veteran struggling with some trauma that made her less than a perfect parent. So our kid is doing better now but he still has residual moments where he throws a fit and/or sulks if we make him get off to hang with us and play with us. He thinks he deserves endless play time because that's what his dad still does. Our boy says he likes games because everything you do or every skill you \"learn\" is so much easier in games. I tell him straight up that video games mean nothing and the \"accomplishments\" within them mean nothing. Rarely do I even let him talk to me about video games because they are a deterrent for real life accomplishment. Our child takes this as in an insult as I have voiced these opinions to him. Idc if he does because it's lead to progress and now he plays all the sports, actually works hard irl and knows how to be social and talk to people about real life and experiences. He does resent my take on games occasionally and doesn't like that I won't talk about them but honestly with this progress idgaf if that's the thing he resents me for.",
