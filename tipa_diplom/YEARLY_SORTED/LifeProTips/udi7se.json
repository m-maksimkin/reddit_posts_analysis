Their teammates who came to work sick multiple times when I told them to go home. You're right though, we shouldn't question those people.

I had missed 2 days of school for my grandmother's funeral, which I understand is a common loss, but it was the first loss I'd had in my immediate family and I was especially close with her and absolutely devastated beyond words. I'd been reading the book but was honestly too distraught to comprehend it. I just didn't want to explain my loss and cry at school again or fall behind farther than I was. \n\nMy absolute monster of a teacher called me out in front of the class. I said I'd left my book in my locker because my grandmother had DIED and I had no way of knowing I would miss school and was not going to make the trip to pick it up and read at home. \n\nShe told me to my face and the whole class I should have gone to a library. (What's worse is that I lived in an unincorporated area where a library card costs $100+).\n\nIn her mind,, I should have, in my shock, grief, and depression, gotten one of my grieving relatives to take me to a library or bookstore, obtain a copy of HUCKLEBERRY FINN to read while planning, attending, and healing from my grandmother's funeral.\n\nNo offense to Mark Twain, but Huckleberry Finn is simply ruined for life. \n\nA teacher worth their salt would have asked me individually. My dad called the school and asked them to contact my teachers to let then know why I was missing school and to please give me an extra day or two to turn in my assignments and to please not call on me unless I raised my hand. I was just crying all the time and didn't want to accumulate too much make up work. None of them got the message. I got a zero on a paper for turning it in one day late and I was too numb to even argue about it. \n\nThe only teacher who had any mercy on me was one who had pulled me into the hallway to asked where my work was and I simply cried in her arms because I was so upset about losing my grandma. She had recently just had her first grandchild, so she gave me one (1!) Extra day to turn in a week of trigonometry work. \n\nIt was the absolute worst time in my young life. I felt like no adults listened or saw my pain or how much I was struggling and grieving with the first death of someone I actively knew and loved. It made me lose so much faith in other people and the systems we have. \n\nThis year will be 10 years since then and just thinking about that time in my life still cuts so deeply. I've had to heal so slowly and hope I can do better for the people in my life in navigating the cruelty of the world we have to endure",

She contacted her office (and my mom) to inform them she would have to extend her leave to fly from San Antonio to Boston to help make funeral arrangements and bury her mom.\n\nThe home office said she couldn't go, because on her original return date from her vacation they were going to start reviews.  She apologized and said that would have to wait, as she was going to her MOTHER'S funeral.  They just told her that there would be a severe punishment if she didn't return per her scheduled return date.  My mother went to bat for her and wasn't able to get anywhere with her higher ups.\n\nShe didn't have the luxury of just quitting at the time, so she came back and completed the reviews.  She had to assist her family in making all of the arrangements over the phone and via email.  After the dust settled, she immediately started seeking a job elsewhere and got another job 3 months later.\n\nIt's worth nothing my state (Missouri) has no legal obligation to give employees time for bereavement, as crazy as that is.",

The customer rep was so sympathetic, almost sounded like she was going to cry.\nThen I called United and the woman was so cold and robotic. She told me they couldn’t refund me, but they’d issue me United credit if I paid a $200 change fee, which they said they’d waive if I provided the death certificate. I said, “I don’t have a death certificate, he died 45 minutes ago.” She said, “that’s our policy sir. You can pay the $200 change fee now to get the credit, then submit the death certificate later to apply for the $200 refund.”\n\nSo I literally had to whip out my credit card and pay United $200 45 minutes after my dad died and I never had the heart to ask my step-mom for the death certificate, just so I could get a $200 refund.\n\nObviously never flew United ever again.",

I told my editor-in-chief that I was heading back but would take a laptop, but he wasn't hearing it -- no time, couldn't spare me, had to be present, bad example to my staff, I needed to take my career more seriously, etc. (For the record, I co-founded the book we were at -- my second magazine startup in two years. I was in my mid-twenties. He was 50. Eff that guy.) After a good bit of back-and-forth, a fair portion of it conducted in front of the staff, I said \"but it's a few days, maybe a week,\" to which the e-in-c responded, and I quote, 'You don't know that! He could linger!\" \n\nI snapped. Yelled \" WELL LET ME JUST SEE HOW FAST WE CAN GET HIM PLANTED\" and walked out of the building. Flew home, got to say goodbye. Came back a week later and spoke to the e-in-c solely through intermediaries after that. Angled my way into classification as a 'home office\" worker after a chat with a company exec a few months later. Moved cross-country immediately and didn't mention it to the e-in-c. He didn't find out until one of the execs asked me about it at a company event I flew back to attend... seven months later. \n\nExec: \"So, bogartsfedora, how are you liking Seattle?\" \n\nE-in-C (startled): \"You moved?!\"\n\nExec (staring at e-in-c): \"Yyyyes. Several months ago.\" (turns to me) \"I'm so glad you're here. Did you get my housewarming gift?\"\n\nbogartsfedora: <smirk>\n\nIt's been a quarter of a century. I moved to a different publication not long after that. Magazine's been dead 20 years. \n\nThe eff-that-guy sentiment, however, is still in full  effect.",

I know that’s a sticky position in the medical and emergency services fields but I still feel very strongly that there should be enough personnel to mitigate those needs. If there aren’t then there’s a serious staffing issue but nobody that runs those organizations wants to admit that. \n\nI went through a shift in Department Directors at my last job. Our long-time Director had no issue with me taking all the time I needed when my Grandfather died. It was a really hard time for me and my Mom; and I was the only grandchild involved in the planning process for the funeral and service. \n\nThe Director that replaced her now expects everyone to always take their laptop with them and to always be on call. A co-worker was reprimanded for not answering emails and getting to work quickly enough on the day he took off to move to a new house. Didn’t matter that they were requiring him to use his vacation time for the full day while still asking him to work or that he had a young child he and his wife were trying to keep an eye on since they couldn’t get anyone to watch her during the move. They tried to give him a verbal warning but HR had to remind them that they couldn’t since he’d technically taken a vacation day. \n\nThis became the standard expectation for everyone for everything: weekends, medical appointments/illness, late after hours (10pm and later), early pre-hours (5am and earlier), weddings, funerals, vacations. The environment was awful in the office and then we couldn’t even really get away from it at home. \n\nThese places don’t value your time, your personal life or relationships or any boundaries that a healthy leadership team will have in place to promote a decent work-life balance, and-most often-don’t compensate well for that, either. \n\nThese places will do a lot of damage to you personally and professionally.

I drove there with my husband at 5 in the morning after my mom called. They wanted to remove the body, because he died abruptly during the night, and my mom was stalling them so I could say goodbye...\n\nI'll always remember. I held his hand, he was so cold. I think my legs just failed me at that moment.\n\nI then had HR running after me and stressing me to get that paper (death certificate) to acknowledge the few days I took off (I think we had 2-3 days for a grandparent). I was so mad, having to get a paper that confirmed one of the persons I loved most was dead...\n\nThe pain of it is still so vivid. These HR got me into a lot of stress in the 5years I was there...",
