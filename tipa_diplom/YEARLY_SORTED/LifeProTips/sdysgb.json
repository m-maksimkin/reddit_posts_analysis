    "LPT: This is a friendly reminder that employees currently have more power to negotiate for improved benefits and pay raises than at any point in the last 20+ years. Take advantage of it!!\nDue to the shortage of employees, most employers are desperate for good help. That means you should be seeking pay raises, promotions, and increased benefits.\n\nUnless you are completely satisfied with your job and your income, shop around. Chances are you will find someone desperate for help and willing to pay more than your current employer. If you like your job, shop around anyway, then politely ask your employer to match/beat those offers.\n\nLook after yourself! This employment opportunity will not last forever!": [

            "text": "Some tips from an executive recruiter (qualifications at bottom if you need the cred)\n\n1) There are 4 reasons why a company hires someone:\n  *To solve a problem\n  *To make them more money\n  *To save them money\n  *To make them look good\nBefore your interview, make a list of how you can do each of these things for this company specifically.  Then, make sure to plug these value propositions in your interview answers.\n2) Unless the role's #1 priority is high-level technical skills (surgeons, fighter pilots, engineers), the biggest reason they usually make selections is based on FIT WITH COMPANY CULTURE.  You can teach anyone tangible skis, but you're not valuable if you leave in 6 mo because you weren't a good fit for the company culture (and turnover is one of the biggest money, productivity and time sucks a company faces, and it's way more common than you think)\n3)  Job posts that have a bunch of non-negotiable \"requirements\", will often compromise significantly for the right person (and most of them don't even know it; I've placed a ton of people lacking 2/3 of the \"must\" haves the company gave me, including college degrees and literally decades of experience).  Id I brought them someone with decent skills, that they liked and trusted they would stick around long-term, they quickly forgot their long list of wants and needs.  Don't *not* apply because you're short some credentials; worst case they don't consider you, best case you took a swing that changes your life.\n4) Don't look for job postings, look for companies you want to work for.  Then follow the guide below to create the opportunity.  50% of the jobs I've ever gotten personally have been by *creating a need for me*, therefore creating a need to create an opportunity to get me in while I'm on the market.  Top talent is rare, so when they see it, they want to grab it (especially because it costs a ton of money to recruit, interview, hire, train and oversee a new employee.  And half the time they don't last, making it expensive to do it all again. If they see someone who looks like a long-hauler, they're more likely to pounce. Even if this is a stepping stone job, don't let them know that.\n5) Most companies require resumes to apply, but half the time they don't even get reviewed, and they can even do more damage than good (some red flags you had no idea you had, missing certain skills or requirements, etc).  Have one prepared (and if it's not excellent, pay someone to help you) but before you agree to apply online, call and ask who the hiring manager is and if they're available. Note: HR is NOT the hiring manager, they are the hiring process person who will send you right to the website to apply.  You need to bypass them--if you can.  If they person you want to talk to isn't available, ask them when a good time to connect with them might be.  If they ask why you're calling, know the gatekeeper's job is to strictly keep you from the gatekeeper because they're busy (and not to get yelled at by said boss by sending them an applicant).  So a good response is \"I appreciate you asking, I know (name)'s time is super valuable.  This is a confidential matter though, so I'd like to discuss with him/her first before deciding whether or not to disclose to anything further.  How to justify the confidentiality when you talk to the boss?  You're currently employed, and your employer is unaware you're exploring other opportunities, so you'd like to keep it confidential until you're ready to make the move.  They will honor this.  Impress them on the phone by saying something like \"My me is ___, and I specialize in ___.  I greatly appreciate you taking my call; I know your time is valuable so I promise to be brief and then you can decide if it makes sense to continue the conversation if that sounds fair with you?  I've been doing research on your company, and when I read XYZ I was really impressed that you're doing (something unique, innovative, the best).  I feel I've hit a ceiling at my current company and I'm looking to make a change to a company where I'm more challenged and can contribute all I have to offer, not just some of it.  I know the standard process is to apply with a resume online, but what I've found is that you can't get a feel for someone's character, passion or connection on a piece of paper.  I really feel I could be of great value to your organization so I thought it was important to see if we had a natural connection before investing more of either of our time.  Would you mind sharing with me a bit about what you're excited about business this year and why you're excited about it?\n6) An interview is a MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL PARTNERSHIP, don't beg them to take you.  You are a valuable asset, so present yourself as such.  Ask them about their management style (is it more hierarchical or open-door?)? What are the advancement opportunities? Can you describe your perfect fit for this role (ask this early so you can tailor your answers!) What can they offer you?\n7) As someone else mentioned, EVERYTHING is negotiable.  Like when buying a car, if your hot button is your trade in value, I won't give you a price break, but I will give you a higher trade value.  Vice versa, it you care about\"winning\" a price war, I'll give you the standard trade in and give you sir discount.  Doesn't matter where is comes from, the profit margin is the same.  Negotiate work from home days, vacation, come in at 7 to leave an hour early, company car, stipends, profit sharing, commission percentages, professional training, negotiate it all \n8) Follow up with an in-person follow up. Bring your resume if you know you need it.  Ask for the hiring manager by name and have your resume in a folder so the staff can't see your just trying to apply for a job.   Speak confidently like you know them personally and the receptionist shouldn't have the audacity to ask who you are.  Keep calling once a week until you get them.\n9) Professional etiquette: Firm handshake, eye contact, stand straight, shoulders back, button up shirt or blouse or blazer, dresses/skirts no higher than above the knee (ie: pencil cut), men: don't drown in your jacket, don't wear too much makeup, light or no perfume (some people are allergic and that's a great way to get shown the door, other people might not like the scent), close toes shoes, no heels hight than a couple inches, limited classy jewelry (don't go loud), don't smoke on the way (seriously, get a vape or something, bit you think you don't smell...but you do), bring a notepad with pre-written questions and notes).\n\nThanks for coming to my excessively long--but hopefully helpful--Ted talk.",

            "text": "Some negotiating tips for people since there is a lot of bad advice on this topic out there:\n\n* Don’t go in guns blazing. So often do I hear people suggesting to go in and **demand** an outlandish position because they think they’ll catch the counter-party in such shock and panic that they’ll easily walk them back to the best outcome for the initiator. This is not how real life negotiations work. Negotiations are best done when **both parties feel like their needs are being met.** If you have a hardline position and tons of leverage then it’s not a negotiation…it’s a demand. \n\n* Additionally, human emotion plays a big role in negotiations. It’s not all hard calculations. Sometimes people will be more stingy simply because they think you’re an ass. Being super aggressive on an opening position is an easy way to create an “us vs them” situation where the counterparty doesn’t believe you’ll be negotiating in good faith. It’s like if you went into a raise discussion and they offered a $0.01 raise. You’d probably not even want to continue the discussion (or job) after being so insulted even if they were actually willing to go higher. \n\n* Most negotiations are situations where all parties can win. Don’t lock yourself into the mentality that there is a set pie that you have to fight over for your share. It’s possible to grow the pie during a negotiation. How?\n\n* Find mismatched priories between parties! If negotiating an employment situation, what do you care about most? Pay raise? More vacation? More autonomy? Remote work? Now think about your employer and what they care about most. Things where you care a lot less compared to your employer and vice versa are where you can make everyone happier. \n\n* Everything is negotiable. Got approved for remote work but not as much of a raise as you’d hope? See if you can’t get a “remote work stipend” which likely comes from a totally different budget than salary. Frame the benefit as something that keeps you working efficiently (e.g., extra monitors, ergonomic chair, standing desk) while also reminding them of the lower operation costs that come with remote workers. Even if your company doesn’t have these benefits, your request may be the thing that spawns them into creation. \n\n* Most negotiations have a hidden party. That discussion between you and your manager? Well your manager is operating under their own constraints from upper management/HR. You and your landlord negotiating next years lease? They have their bank and mortgage on the other side to balance. Which brings me to the most important part of any negotiation…\n\n* Information. The more prepared you can be understanding the positions and motivations of all counter parties the better. The more independent data you can bring to support your reasoning (e.g., industry pay comps, research on the tie between worker efficiency and workplace comfort, competitor actions, hard data as well as qualitative reviews showing your impact) the more convincing you’ll be.\n\n**Edit:** For a good book on this subject, I recommend “Negotiation Genius” by Deepak Malhorta, Max H. Bazerman and published by Harvard Business School",

Further, they changed the bonus plan so that even if you're an average employee and still meet your objectives at 100%, your bonus will be 60-75% and not the full 100%.  They aren't really helping things.  I've been spending a ton of time looking for work elsewhere because of crap like this.",

I’ve been in role for a few years now and have mastered the mechanics of it, but the workflow situation keeps getting perpetually worse to the point of burnout. Plus I had seen so many new hires come and go in the past year that I’ve become one of the few experts left in my department. So as a result I was looking at other position internally - I’m a young professional and seeking growth opportunity as opposed to staying in this same role forever. Never mentioned that I was also looking at external opportunities but I think that would have been clear anyways.\n\nNext thing I knew I was given a 9.9% raise. Apparently anything 10% or higher and the big wigs in NY had to sign off on it and their policy is no major raises right now (except for themselves of course). This raise is completely independent of my annual merit increase (usually about 3-6%) and quarterly bonus (based on performance and sales). I’ve had a good year and stand to gain a total salary increase of about 14% plus larger than normal bonuses. If I hadn’t said anything I would just be getting 3-6% raise and my normal quarterly bonuses.\n\nOver all I like my job but the workload has become so intense that it’s really taking a toll on me. I’m still looking for other opportunities but just mentioning that to my employer really helped since the pay is better now.

Ask other people in your field how much they are making and find any available information online through Indeed or US labor and statistics.\n2. Show your worth. Communicate with your supervisor on what problems you have been able to solve and what goals you have been able to meet.\n3. Continue to reinforce your loyalty to the company and that you would prefer to continue to build your skills with them. Leveraging an another offer or giving them an ultimatum just shows them you have one foot out the door and will damage any goodwill that has been built.\n4. All negotiations should be done via email or in writing by all parties involved. It is really easy for your employer to string you along with nondescript verbal promises that never materialize.\n5. Negotiate your pay with those who actually have the power to increase your pay. Recruiters and HR r may not have an influence over negotiations regarding your pay, your supervisor may not even have the authority as it may actually be your supervisor’s boss that has that ability.\n6. When you are ready to ask for higher pay, ask for a specific number based on the market research (see number 1) you have completed and include tasks that you may be doing that are not included in your job description and accomplishments that justify this rate of pay. \n7. Do not be afraid to walk away and get another job that pays the rate you should be getting if your employer does not negotiate in good faith. \n\nExperience: I am a rehab director in the medical field in the skilled nursing field and have negotiated higher wages for myself and my staff.",

Leave emotion out of it - stay neutral to neutral/positive\n2. Use I think statements, not I feel (stems from #1)\n3. Discuss how you've added value, and other ways you'll continue to in the future\n4. If your weaknesses come up, be prepared to re-frame them as opportunities for growth\n5. Be direct and concise\n6. Be reasonable/realistic\n7. DO NOT act entitled, under any circumstances - even if you are, don't frame it that way\n8. DO NOT try to use an offer from another position unless you're prepared to leave - that maneuver can get you fired on the spot\n9. DO NOT SELL YOURSELF SHORT\n\nYou have to stay aggressive around your rate of pay. Not to the point of annoyance, but they're not going to come to you. Most employers are going to ignore the conversation all together giving you an annual cost of living raise of 3.5%. That won't even keep up with inflation. You determine your worth.
