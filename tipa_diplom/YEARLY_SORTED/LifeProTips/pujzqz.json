You could easily find a job that pays $10 an hour.  So you’d end up with at least $100 extra a week if you worked full time.  The hotel has wifi, hvac, is furnished, and even has tv.  A pool and a business center with a computer with internet.  Surely this isn’t ideal but it’s an easy staring point and way better than not having shelter.  \n\nI’m not being an ass or anything about this- I just genuinely don’t understand.

I was homeless for a year and traveled across the United States so I speak from experience. I agree with everything you said about maintaining appearance etc but not with the whole \"don't hang around homeless\" \n \n Not every person who's homeless is going to look homeless, or be a drug addict or \"use\" you for personal gain. There's a fucking lot of homeless who don't look homeless that will GIVE YOU THE SHIRT OFF THEIR BACKS, feed you, I've even had some actually give me money while being simultaneously homeless. \n  \nAlso if you're new to being homeless it's actually beneficial to befriend a homeless person if they are a decent person, regardless of homeless status, people are people no matter what and it's on you to judge character and character alone. \nThe benefit of having a friend \"in the know\" can be extremely helpful. \n\nThey know resources. They know where the food kitchens are, the shelters, the donation centers are,  among other homeless street tips.\n\n My wife and myself we're just about out of gas when we stopped in Missouri while heading east while homeless.\n The most dirtiest person I have ever seen in my life (think dust clouds around Pig Pen from Peanuts, homeless or otherwise) came over and hung out with us while we were trying to beg for gas. \n\nBHomie was dirty, clothes tattered but loved his life and had a great soul. He gave us water, smoked a joint with us and then gave us some very good information we would not have known otherwise. In fact his information saved our ass and if I would have had the notion to stay away from homeless people we would have been stuck a lot longer.\n\n For context he told us to stop holding a sign asking for gas (pan handling) and just call the Police. \n\n WHAT? THE POLICE? \n\nYes, he said. \n\n He goes on to say that the small rural town didn't like drifters hanging around so the town helped them along their way when needed. I was hesitant but he assured me they would help me so I called. An officer came out and talked to us and gave us two options.\n\n1. A hotel for the night and a meal\n\n2. A tank of gas and a meal.\n\nWhat?? I was flabbergasted, how could this be? \nWell I don't know but it was, and all thanks to a dirty looking hobo. (No offense James, even though I know you'll never see this)\n\nDon't choose who you hang out with by their appearance, choose who you hang out with by who they are as a person.\nYou never  know what opportunities you might pass up, homeless or not, if you do.  \n\nWe choose the tank of gas and meal, which was any meal on the Mcdonald's menu we wanted (vouchers).  \nFuck, McDonald's?? Not my normal fare but seeing as we had been eating peanut butter sandwiches the last several days it was like a 5-star restaurant to us. As Eddie Murphy once said \"Is that a Saltine?\" \"Wooo that's the best damn cracker I've had my entire life\" \n\nAnyways you can down vote away at my opinion because I don't care about fake internet points, I care about good wholesome people who can be lumped into a crowd based on appearance. \n\nI think I might have been triggered just at the thought of the \"don't hang out with homeless\" and got a little emotional but my thoughts remain true even if I dove overboard on this comment.",

Free showers and a place to groom yourself in a mirror\n\nIf it’s cold stuff your jackets and pants with newspaper for insulation. There’s free papers on every major city corner\n\nIf you lack shelter, scrape together about thirty dollars for painters plastic. You can find a few trees and make a make shift elevated shelter using all of it to make sure it supports your weight (before anyone comes for me I’m in Colorado and there is a recycle bin in every area.  When I was through I always removed it and put it in a recycle bin) another plus to this is you have your own space away from the dangers you will face in the inner city. Double this up with the newspaper tip and you have a cozy humble abode away from the elements. \n\nFood is a big deal. Always try to find the best bang for your buck. When I was homeless Burger King was doing ten nuggets for 1.25. I’d buy atleast two of those and drink a shit ton of water between breakfast and lunch. It helps keep you full and the protein will give you the energy to build shelter or shower. \n\nAs for water and stuff bars out here in Colorado will usually fill up a cup for you. Or if you are in a remote area eat some snow. I know it may sound gross but you’re homeless. No water means no life. \n\nI used the Boulder college campus to update my resume and print it out. So long as you don’t look too out of place and act like you belong there no one will bar an eye at you and it’s a good way to get some free things. \n\nI’m not homeless anymore, this was almost three years ago and these helped a lot in being able to maintain my appearance to pull myself out of that situation.

While these tips are good WHILE homeless, there is one and only one tip to get you OUT of being homeless, ASK FOR WORK (not money).  \n\nI sat outside of a grocery store for months, asking anyone who went into the bank attached if they knew \"where can I find some work?\".  I did this for months.  One day this dude saw me walk past his shop as I was going to this little camp ground that was made by previous homeless people. There was a tent and when you're homeless, them bitches mansions.  He stopped me, asked what was up, I told him.  He said I must be the guy his wife said was asking for work at the grocery store.  I said yeah, probably, do you know where by chance?  He gave me a job, in 2001, paying me 10 bucks an hour.  After a few weeks he let me sleep under the stairs in the shop (I can not describe to you how much heaven and peace that brings a person, just sleeping in a box, but feeling SAFE (seriously, you think your sleep safety is no joke, buy a ticket to a city you know no one, bring like 6 bucks and see how just a day goes for you and then wait until you need some sleep, it's fucking frightening).  I worked with him 7 days a week for 2 months, his wife made me breakfast and a beefy as hell lunch every single day.  After that 2 months, I got my own place, got a new job on a bus line and my life has never gone backwards since.\n\nPoint being, being homeless is sooooooooo much harder than most of you imagine, it's physical pain, the mental pain can be unreal (which is why people often turn to drugs).  This is also why our Govt can't fix it, they only provide one of the two things needed: stability and an opportunity.  You can't give a homeless person just one, they need both.  \n\nThis guy, John P (I will never forget this man), gave me an opportunity, saw I was taking it then gave me stability.  Took 1 month of having both - first month I worked for him I still slept outside) - before I was able to save enough money to get a place with a roommate and build from there.  \n\nSo, if you find yourself homeless, asking for a buck only helps today, asking for work at some point will change your situation.  Take care of your health as best you can, stay out of the sun, try to find a safe space for yourself, even if it's in a tree n the middle of the woods.  Keep your mind in good shape and just ask for work, and sooner than later you will run into your angel to give you just that one chance you need.  You may need to ask 1000 people, but one of them is going to help you in a way you can help yourself.",

OP is right, you cant solve their problems. you gotta start with yours. ask all the food stores where they throw their expired food. if you are polite and nice you might get some sympathy coffee and pastry, and a weekly container with food. dont loiter in front of people. if you wanna be lazy or whatever go away somewhere else for a day or a week or so. people might even miss you. if you get money from somebody, always decline it and ask them to help you to get a DRs appointment and a checkup. or a trip to the dentist or whatever. never expect it, but be firm and express that you really dont need money. you need actual help with booking appointments, dr, social, mental health. infections, diseases, pain, sleep, malnutrition, you have a lot of issues. declining money is one of the strongest resources you have. its basically all you got left in most cases. you need a homecooked meal, surrounded by healthy bonded people. like a non dysfunctional family. i know all families are dysfunctional. but some are really really bad. and if you come from one of those, then you really really need good role models. animals are usually very good to learn from. like a well balanced dog. but i mean all the animals in nature are doing things to survive. doing their best. just as you are. if you study them you will notice they are usually very good at what they are doing. they keep persisting. even when it gets real bad. and i mean even birds have nests, and plan their food like the squirrel. same birds return each year. they know what to do. just as you do. there is a reason you are not letting yourself do it. you know if you actually tamed yourself, became the parent you never had to yourself. treated yourself with the same love you poured into others. it would change everything. it would snap you out of this illusion your mind has told itself. all that negative self talk the world has taught you. that is the first of the many challenges. but honestly, give me one reason why you dont deserve the same love you give to the people you love the most? why dont use that tone when you talk about yourself with others? but then i mean, if its drugs and if its mental illness on top of all this. then its going to be a hell of a journey. its going to take a lot of effort and learning that failure is really just recalibration. i mean good on OP for making this post. not expecting anything in return and giving to the right people, creates moments where good things happen. its hard to understand if you come from a life where strong take, and weak dont eat. where punishment is violence. there is a lot of growing that is needed. i mean life is what it is. we can choose to make it worse, the same, or better. as long as you are walking in the right direction, it does not matter so much how fast you are moving. at least you are on the way. you can dream about it. it can become more real for each day.",

Let a potential employer know your current situation, if it's a good person to work for they won't care and may even help your if not, fuck . 5.

The church bit can help, but only if you can find a local church that does a meal/soup kitchen type deal.  Sometimes you can get a bit of help from a church for rent (usually a one time deal, and that’s if you’re lucky).\n\nIf you are homeless and suffer from mental illness (which is extremely common) please find a way to get help on that front. Getting out of the homeless situation can be a cyclical issue if you don’t. Try and find a crisis center, call your local PD to submit yourself to an eval (they won’t hold you for long but it CAN help, not guaranteed), go to your local ER and tell them you are experiencing a mental health crisis. These things can suck, but can also be helpful if you actually try and cooperate. I had issues with these methods, but I also didn’t allow myself to GET the help that was being provided. \n\nAlso just saying don’t do drugs or alcohol is ignorant of what causes some people to become homeless in the first place.\n\nAlso, how does one not look *too* homeless? That’s just asinine, if you’re homeless you don’t get much of a choice.\n\nIt’s a bit upsetting that this is so high up on Reddit rn considering this isn’t helpful to people who might actually be looking for help.\n \nThis one might be a bit obvious but it’s worth saying: friends and family, suck it up and ask for help. It may be embarrassing but it’s worth a shot to ask for a couch for a bit (if you have people). This isn’t always an option as a lot of folks don’t have that support, but I knew plenty of people who were too proud to ask for help and stayed on the street.\n\nAlso: most people who are homeless probably don’t have access to Reddit, so this seems more like a feel good post than anything. \n\nGlad you got out of your situation OP, it’s not an easy thing to do but I don’t think this post is helpful.",

It’s funny that it pops up in my feed after having a conversation with my husband yesterday about how much resourcefulness and sheer willpower it must take to pick oneself up from a homeless situation. \n\nIf anyone who has experience with being homeless or community outreach specifically for the homeless, I would like to know as a person in my community, where can I create the most impact in helping? \nI have donated handmade hats and volunteered at our local men’s shelter. I’ll continue to do those things, as well as give cash when I have it, who cares if it’s getting spent on something to illicitly bring comfort for the night. I want to know about the stories where communities have made headway and helped to alleviate and create a resource net for their area. I want to know about the donated items that are most practical and necessary to maintaining some semblance of comfort. I want to know if anyone has had any luck in attempting to reignite the spark of empathy in those members of our communities that are unwilling to even look at the homeless problem and are investing in expansion away from the areas plagued with infrastructure issues, homelessness, and violence; rather than looking towards solutions for issues that we are responsible for as a community. Anything you have to share about how we can find solutions and help find ways to both prevent and help liberate people from homelessness; I’ll be here taking notes. Or even just stories you care to share, I’m here for it. TIA.\n\nFor anyone still experiencing this or who has experienced this, I think you’re incredibly brave and strong even in just enduring the circumstances that life has handed you, no matter how they came to be . Keep your chin up and know that there are people who still care and are rooting for you, even if you can’t always see or hear them.",

I got 2 jobs and bounced from area to area each night so I was never in the same place. One night I was asleep in my blazer I had parked in a Walmart parking lot. A state trooper pulled up on me and knocked on my window. It scared the ever living shit out of me. He asked me what I was doing and why I was sleeping in my truck. He was the first and only person to ever ask me if I was okay! In that instant he didn’t even think twice he told me he would help me get a better job so I could save and get my own place. In this time I was battling my addiction as well had just found out my father was dying of cancer. It all hit me like a ton of bricks! I knew I wanted something better for my life so I decided to go make peace with the decision my father made to walk away from his first born child. In that moment I seen him my life changed to the core. This was July 15,2013 from that moment of seeing him and him saying well I know your strong you can be anything you want so go do IT! That struck a cord in me and That night I drove in my truck after leaving his house and parked in a parking lot and overdosed. Thankfully god was on my side that day and I was saved in time! I took that moment in time and etched it in my brain! This isn’t you! You can do better and be better than they ever were to me. I reached out to officer hardy the state trooper that approached me and he put in a word at a 7-11 in downtown for the owners to give me a job and he would back me. I never had someone show me compassion the way this police officer did. It changed my life. I worked my ass off 7 days a week while still being homeless saving every penny except a dollar a day for a McDonald’s burger. After 6 months with that job I was promoted to assistant manager all while still homeless. On my birthday I got a message frok my fathers friend saying he is waiting for you to come\nSee him before he leaves this earth! I refused for almost 2 weeks to go see him because why what did he do for me other than abandon me. So finally I sucked up my pride got off work in between shifts and drove to his house. I walked in and he was almost comatose in hospice care! My heart ached more than I ever thought so many unanswered questions came rising back. I kissed him on the cheek and said I forgive you for everything and I will show you I’m gonna be better than anyone ever expect! He died at 1:13am February 17 hours after I had left his house! I was broken like the 14 year old girl all over again. I was on my way to work that afternoon and wrecked my truck I felt like my whole life everything I was working so hard for was taken away in an instant. I didn’t let it defeat me. I started taking public transportation and let my truck sit in a parking lot and checked on it every day to make sure it wouldn’t be towed and my goal is to continue saving money to get a house and then I would worry about getting my vehicle fixed. 6 Months after my fathers death I moved into my first place I could call home in my life! It was such a liberating feeling and since then I’ve just grown and become better. While helping as many others in the same position as I could along the way. Now I can say proudly that I have helped more than 10 people off the streets of Austin being homeless by giving them a free place to stay in my home so that they could save money to get on their feet. That’s actually how I met my husband! Good things come to those that work for them!",

They’re all on Hartz 4 and the income they get is just shy of what my wife earns as a Seiteneinsteiger.

If you qualify for SNAP, Medicaid or WIC you probably qualify for their discounts. \n\nI had a membership there and it went from $75/mo to like $35/mo and it has showers, gym, pool, classes, hot tub and sauna with an area to eat and lockers that you can stow stuff in for quite some time too if needed. \n\nThe biggest tip i can actually give is to befriend shop workers and owners. I've gotten more help and heads-up from them than anyone out there. Free food, places to park a car, job opening knowledge and local insight. This is helpful...especially small gas stations. Gas station employees are basically bar tenders in smaller towns. You get regulars and eventually those regulars divulge pretty much all of their life. That sort of candid bit of knowledge goes a long way. A room for rent, someone who can sympathize... anything.\n\nI was completely honest with my gas station workers and ended up knowing all of them on a first name basis. I got free soda fountain drinks, donuts, and roller grill food when it was getting older. \n\nAnother tip is find a temp agency and explain your story. They often will have way more knowledge about opportunities than they let on initially. They know employer's stories and get very close to them. I was able to score two full time gigs with them despite it not being within corporate guidelines. \n\npersonally explaining everything up front and showing your true stress and hardship was the best decision I'd ever made. \n\nIn fact... More recently in the last year I'd had yet another living place hardship. Instead of calling around to 10,000 apartments and rooms for rent I made a craigslist ad explaining my living situation and the fact that i need my dog with me (shes a dual certified therapy dog that i'd gotten and trained about 4 months before becoming homeless a couple of years ago.). That craigslist ad got me a half dozen phone calls in a couple of days with possible living option. Now I rent out a 4000 sq ft warehouse that I've been working out of and have a really nice bedroom and a full kitchen, shower, bathroom. All of this for $500/mo. I wouldn't have gotten this place if it weren't for that craigslist ad.",

Homelessness is somewhat of a choice here (not always of course), we do have social security systems in place that can aid you getting back on your feet. Sure, not all of them are great or perfect but they do exist. Under 18, your parents and/or family is still responsible for you, you can go to the youth welfare office and they will help you out (even in court). Over 18, counties/municipalities are required by law to provide you shelter for a short time either via homeless shelters or other social institutions. The state can provide you with a home but it takes a valid ID, paper work and time to process it, all thanks to our bureaucracy (During that time, you can be homeless but it would be temporary). You can find a job through the employment office or a job centre. Having said all that, there is the possibility of being extremely unfortunate and you can get stuck in a loop of \"Cannot get an apartment because I don't have a job. I cannot get a job because I do not have an apartment or permanent place to stay\". In this case, having friends or other family members you still get along with to stay at until you have a job that can pay rent is a huge benefit and would make all of this a lot easier.",

Or at least be smart enough to know that they have to do those things to get out of the situation.\n\nThe problem is, the vast majority of the people who are chronically homeless don't have that capacity...\n\nThey for one reason or another don't have the capacity to meet the requirements set by our standards of what you have to do in order to \"make it\" in society. Hence they never escape the terrible cycle of homelessness.\n\nI'm not trying to lay all the blame on other people. At the end of the day we are all responsible for ourselves and the ideas we each believe in. That includes homeless people, but simply put many homeless people do not currently have the capacity to make any meaningful change in their situation.\n\nThe truth is some homeless people are going to need a lot of help. More help than most people individually are willing to give.\n\nHomelessness is always going to be something communities must solve together, but that requires willing and capable individuals of that community to come together and figure out how to change how those communities handle the homeless.\n\nThe sad thing I see online here in places like the Seattle sub-reddits is community coming together, but instead of positive and hopeful communication it's all hate and finger pointing...\n\nI really do feel that as healthy on our feet individuals the burden of change is on us. Whatever that means. \n\nHomeless people are a very easy target to point a finger and go, \"look at what's wrong with society\" when we really should be pointing that finger towards ourselves.\n\nWe struggle as Americans even to take care of our aging parents, and we wonder why we can't solve homelessness.\n\nUntil we find a way in our own personal lives to free up more energy to be compassionate to step outside of our own comfort zone and help strangers that are perhaps struggling in our own communities or change what is a required for someone to survive nothing will get better.\n\nOr perhaps we will finally be honest and realize that currently we all believe that there is a bottom line to survival and if you don't meet those requirements you simply won't survive.",

Do it RIGHT do not party, do not drink, make friends and hike and do the stuff you imagine people go for because if you step a toe out of line with the rangers or management you will be thrown out, they have thousands of people to replace you. \n\nThey provide food, housing, have laundry facilities and a job for the season (taken out of your pay) if you save well you will have enough for an apartment or to rent a room with roommates and get a real job. If you network with other employees you will be able to find other seasonal work and maybe even a ride to it if you're not an asshole. for the next job explain you were homeless, you are trying to get on your feet and the homelessness was circumstance not character, and your willingness to work at the seasonal job proves it. They take almost anyone for housekeeping or kitchens and what's better is you can move on and no one will judge you because it's seasonal, so you aren't being fired or let go.  \n\nThey're basically modern day work houses but you get a rotating menu, 3 meals a day, a pretty place to clear your mind and money to get your life going.\n\nI didn't know how to function in society before i worked in the parks but everyone was so nice, so supportive and so helpful.",

People keep robbing me of my meds and what clothes I still have.  My family thinks I need rehab when I have legitimate physical and mental pain brought on by trauma after trauma.  Widowed, home burned  down when I broke up with a man, physical and sexual assault, etc.  No one tries to understand.  They have just made matters worse by pretending to care yet their actions toward me have now escalated my problems to the level of basically abusing me more by invading my personal space, taking my clothes and other belongings and assaulting me physically and verbally.  Now they have my town thinking bad of me so I cannot get what I need.  I DO want help but I have to take meds that are now not working due to the pain and anxiety.  I have so much physically wrong that I’m terrified of being able to live at all.  My own family and friends have never been there for me like they could. They have been convinced that I can go to rehab with all the medical issues and survive as my meds are now seen as taboo.  I just want my life back! Do no harm is a joke now.  I didn’t hurt myself so why am I being punished.   I have no idea what to do and my posts seem to disappear.   I’m sure of it. Why? People ask questions and get answers. Not me.  If I dont find another pcp and the energy to get to places that could possibly help are those that say they care yet only want what is left of me going to call ahead as I have been gps’d as well and have them turn me away.  They have an agenda that requires me to be unable to help myself for they want me like this.   PLEASE can you offer helpful advice or sites I hope I can access.  That seems to be a problem as well.  I’m finally able to live for me after many many years of helping others, family and friends, to find they have decieved me as well I am desperate and could lose my life!  Do I contact authorities as they have broken into my lockbox and have all my ID info, baking, b. Certificate and attached their device to mine.  I earned all I have yet they are stealing it along with my money and now I am honestly unsafe and fighting to stay alive. The abuse has never stopped although mi thought it would if I didn’t prosecute. Don’t ever be that stupid! PLEASE HELP ME and one of my children that is now a target for helping me. They will not stop photoshopping and splicing recordings to get my inheritance which I do not like to think of as I love my parents. Can you at least offer advise since my phone takes me everywhere but where I need to go.  3 years I have been immobile from an allergy to an rx that the pharmacy would not change. So obviously I am a target and I should not be. I do nothing illegal or immoral.  They just want me out of the way to get my stuff not gotten yet.  Stealing my meds caused me. to VM lose my pcp, btw.   So being homeless and trusting is a bad combination. HELP ME PLEASE so I can help my vchildren, grandchildren enjoy me and so if my parents need care later I can help them. I BEG OF YOU.   HAVE MERCY ON ME!",

I felt ashamed as it was with the dirty looks that I got all the time, begging would have made things worse for my mental health I already felt pretty hopeless.\n\nThe way I got out of it was to plead with the family member who kicked me out to let me back; I got myself a job, a new place of my own and cut that person off.

My family are awful people and were exploiting me for what little money I had so I never got to save to get my own place while emotionally abusing me.  Couch surfing can be a good way to stay safe and get back on your feet faster if it's with the right people  but you have to make sure that they want you to get back on your feet not use you. I went fully on the street homeless and managed to save enough for an apartment in a few months. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done but it had to be done. \n\nAlso it can be so hard to find a decent job when you're in that situation. For a good entry level but decent paying job check smaller construction and manufacturing plants. Huge corporations tend to pay all entry level low skilled jobs minimum wage and small retail don't have the money to pay more but I've found that small and midsized construction and manufacturing gigs will give you a few dollars more per hour even with no experience. Plus you're expected to sweat wear cheap plain cloths and get a layer of dust so it's easier to pass without comment the first few weeks with only sink baths and the occasional bit of laundry. Big problem is probably that most require steel toe shoes to start but there should be some program or person willing to help with a cheap 20$ pair from like Walmart or something if you have a job lined up. Also it can be really hard to jump into that kind of manual labor if you haven't been eating enough so prioritize protein and sheer calories as much as possible once you start.  Canned stews and soups and peanut butter sandwiches work well and can be pretty cheap and are often staples of food pantries.",

People definitely go out of their way to help me more when they see I’m clean physically and mentally as well as working hard at my job. Smelling awful and looking raggedy never helped anyone. I have access to laundry, showers, and clothes through shelters and churches. There’s resources! \n\nDrugs are definitely true. I don’t do any drugs or drink, and I see many of my homeless peers spending all their money on drugs when they aren’t even working. Save it and be smart.\n\nI also know many people are shocked to find out I’m homeless when I tell them. That’s the reaction you want! Work so hard people are shocked you’re homeless.

If you follow a minimalist mindset when you have to live out of your car, it can have a HUGE impact on your comfort and moral level. Keep the back seat down, remember to pull the seat bottom up if you can, and if you can, and have a sedan or a coupe, find someone willing to trade you for a station wagon or hatchback, you get small car efficiency with six foot of sleeping space. Hoard blankets, keep at most 4 pairs of clothes and bare essentials for dinnerware, and if you can get out city limits and find a clean creek off a low traffic gravel road, hang around there where theres space to park so you have water. Camping stoves or bunsen burners are must, and definitely take advantage of the oh shit bars above your windows, a little bit of string you have decent makeshift curtains. For winter living, absolutely get your hands on a fleece comforter, if you have a running car, money is easy to come by with apps like Grubhub and door dash, I bought my fleece for $50 at walmart, and it was well worth it, had me sweating in -20°F, in what was, essentially, a big refrigerator from the 80s. Also keep moving, dont hang around one spot too long or you might get towed, then you're fucked, as impound fees can range from $300 - $3,000 in even cheap areas.\n\nIf you've got a decent car and lose your residency, dump all excess and make it into a little mobile hut, it can turn one of the worst parts of your life into just another \"meh\" situation.
