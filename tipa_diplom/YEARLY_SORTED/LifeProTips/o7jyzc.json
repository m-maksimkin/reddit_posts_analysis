Most times you are doing the job above you, putting in free OT, or already were worth more from the start and then you finally get a bump that still puts you lower than your hopping peers. New hires can get their fair market value today. \n\n\nSecond, your comp will be anchored in whatever you first made when you started. Began around entry level making around 40k then educated/side worked yourself to what should be 80k? Good luck getting anyone to double your salary. \n\n\nThird, if you sleuth or ask around about salaries openly you will find out how much lower you are getting paid for being loyal.\n\n\nThe only counter advice I have is to try to arm yourself with as much information as possible. Learn what salary bands are, other compensations packages. Talk to recruiters to see what you should be paid. Come up with what's important to you outside of a base wage/salary and figure out what it would take for you to actually leave. \n\n\nSo far I had one company act all confused and give bs and another help a little when I had a direct talk and ask for a specific number backed up by some info. Neither case rewarded as well as hopping though.",

            "text": "Alright this is mostly true but it's part of a bigger picture called \"being proactive\". Hopping companies may not be the best way to increase your salary because you may not be qualified enough to warrant a promotion from \"middle\" to \"senior\" or any other climb. Sometimes, you'll get a promotion internally much easier than externally.\n\nThe key word here is \"sometimes\". Being proactive means being self-critical and self-aware of your skillset and its value in the market. If you are proactive and talk to your company about your wants and needs, sometimes they will give it to you, sometimes not. Sometimes another company will see that value and offer you a better role or a better salary.\n\nWhat does being proactive mean? Speak casually with recruiters or companies reaching out to you and say that you're not actively looking for a change but are always interested in growth opportunities. In the job market every candidate and company are both buyers and sellers. The candidate sells their ability and knowledge and buys the salary and benefits. The reverse is for the company, they sell \"salary, benefits, cool office\" in exchange for your skills. If a company is interested in your skills, and you're not interesting in selling, then they have to convince you that what they're selling is worth, well, you.\n\nBasically think of your skillset as an asset that has value in the market. Buyers (companies) can make you offers which you can accept or decline, but if you're not visible or listening, you'll never know what that value is. If you do that, you'll always know what your salary and title could be and from there you can either use that information internally or externally.\n\nFor example: I interviewed at about 4 companies and rejected their offers before finally taking a 5th. When negotiating the salary with the 5th company, they offered me a salary about 10% below the other offers. I explicitly told them: X$ is my current market value based on recent offers from other companies. I won't take a base salary offer below that amount, let's talk about the package starting from there.",

Your company now knows you want out; they may have made the counteroffer as a temporary stopgap while they look for or train your replacement. Most companies can recover from even attrition, provided they have enough time to plan for the loss. And taking a counteroffer, you’re essentially giving them that time.\n\n You also risk alienating or antagonizing the outside company that made a bona fide offer, to the point you may permanently close that door for future opportunities. This may become all the more significant if your original employer does, in fact, replace you.\n\nThere are exceptions to every rule, of course. I’m speaking very generally. The salient point is to remember: when you’re aiming to set up a bidding war, consider all the potential outcomes - including a rescinded offer and black mark by your name, and an eventual termination.",

If you come off emotional or demanding then you also run the risk of becoming what your employer might consider as volatile.  If you like where you work and what you do but feel you deserve more than your current compensation then put it down on paper.  It takes the emotion out of it and you’re just listing facts and you won’t get lost in your thoughts when making the request for higher salary which can often times be quite nerve wracking.\n\nThis is a different time in the work-force right now.  Employers don’t seem so hung up on job history anymore.  It used to be if you applied for a new job and your work history shows you can’t hold a position more than two years then that was a red flag for employers.  However, even before the pandemic employers are starting to focus more on actual ability vs how long you’ve worked somewhere.  BUT people still need to keep in mind this mindset more so applies to a younger generation.  40+ year olds who job-hop don’t tend to fare very well vs younger workers who are given a bit slack in that regard because employers view them as “career starters” still.   \n\nEvery company, management, work environment is different and it’s really up to you to be observant enough to know the dynamics of your environment and trusting your own instincts on when, where and how to request a raise/increase.

And the currency you use to complete these transactions are often pure leverage.\n\nAnd as an employee, often the leverage you can wield is inverse to the size of the company. The bigger it is, the smaller your leverage. \n\nIf you deduce without any trace of uncertainty that you are more valuable than the company is compensating you for. Go out there, and get another job offer, and be ready to accept the position. That is your leverage. If you don't do X, I will leave for Y. If the company just accepts, the worst case scenario is that you overestimated your value, and the leverage wasn't very much. But the upside is, you now know your value for certain, you have a new job with a higher salary, and you're now in a position where you can grow where you are more appropriately valued.\n\nIt doesn't make you a dick if you put your company in an awkward place trying to give yourself mobility. The awkwardness is you using your leverage correctly. And also remember, the company isn't infallible, they can fuck up and not realize it too. But again, it doesn't matter, because you'll be at a new company anyway.",

            "text": "This is terrible advice. I've been on both sides here, a young professional starting out and a hiring manager. Hiring managers understand that people change jobs in part to get more money. That's natural. But they also want people who are committed to the company because it takes time, effort and resources to train new employees.\n\nOf course if you feel like you're not valued, leave. But valued does not mean \"I expect to get huge pay bumps and promotions every year or two\". You should consider many factors when evaluating your fit somewhere, only one of which is money. How's the commute, how are the people, do I see a path to promotion down the road, does my boss make my life easier or harder, what are the benefits, etc.\n\nMany variables. And while I agree with OP that the easiest way to quickly raise your salary is job hop, I promise you that employers are very wary of job hoppers and will see that as a negative. I've hired people at a couple of different places in my time, and my managers always want to know \"why can this person not stay anywhere for more than a year or two\"? It's a red flag.\n\nThat's not to say that you shouldn't ever leave your job. I've left jobs for more money. But when you're being interviewed and you get asked why did you leave this place, then that place....have good answers ready. Opportunity, growth, etc. It still might not be enough if your resume paints you as a job hopper, many employers would rather just go with another candidate if they think that person will be more committed.",

I asked them a rhetorical question: who here has a defined benefit pension?  I knew they all did, because the plan was terminated a few months before I started.  I went on to explain that in order to retire comfortably without a pension, I needed to save $2-4M minimum, so my incentive was to maximize my income to accomplish this daunting task.  I told them that if the company was interested in loyalty, they would incentivize that behavior with long term benefits like defined benefit pensions, but the company had made a choice not to do that, and intelligent people respond to incentives.  When I stopped, it was dead silence.  No one said a word for what seemed like an eternity.

I had my resume out but wasn't necessarily looking to leave. I ended up getting an offer that was really good and so I went to my manager, who was also a good friend, and told him I'd been offered a similar position with better pay and a better promotion path. I knew it was definitely time to leave for sure when he told me straight up that the company \"just doesn't do that\" when I told him I would gladly stay if the company offered some kind of matching compensation. \n\nShould have given my notice on the spot.\n\nThe best he could do was hint that there was a training manager position being created and my experience made me a very strong candidate *wink*, I really hope you stay and interview for it *wink* literally, almost every person I'd worked with or trained said I was a superb trainer and his boss even wanted me to interview ***WINK!***.\n\nWe were short-staffed on shift as it was and so I made the choice to stay because he was my friend and the rest of the people on shift work would just suffer even more if I left right then - like cancelled vacations and 6-7 day work weeks. We worked rotating 12 hour shifts and it was brutal to be under staffed. I felt like it would be awesome to be empowered in a management role and work to improve the training and make things better for the people on shift.\n\nSo I put a smile on, hoping for a way off shift work and a steady training job where I would be able to make it a better place to work, and I turned down the other position. Fuck me, that was dumb.\n\nI didn't get the job. Between my manager and his boss, the director, they chose a woman who had qualified just a year prior. She was great on shift - guess who trained her? And on top of that, the couple people she had started training said the *way* she trained was awesome - guess where she learned that? And she was a great person and good at her job, I don't bear any grudge towards her for it, if anything I'm proud of her.\n\nSupposedly it was a really close race but ultimately they gave her the job for.... Reasons. And it's funny because supposedly it was a sort of unwritten rule that the director only wanted people who were already supervisors or had plenty of experience supervising applying for management roles and she had neither. Another relevant fact for later - she was about 8 months pregnant at this time.\n\nWhat's even funnier, is that my friend and manager was \"asked to step down\" shortly after, putting this woman with absolutely no managerial experience in a position to cover two management jobs. Evidently the director didn't like that my friend wasn't enough of a \"yes man\" and couldn't work with him anymore. He was told he wasn't \"fired\" and he could go back to shift work if he wanted to stay with the company since we were so short-staffed... He took a severance and left.\n\nTo top it off, the woman ended up on maternity leave - which everyone expected - and we had NO manager support for most of a year. The director, in a very clever corporate move, held \"tryouts\" and let each of the shift supervisors basically play manager for a couple months. Manager work at supervisor pay! I should also mention this director lived in another state, commuted for 3-4 days a week (at company expense) and refused to take up the slack of 2 missing managers.\n\nAll the while, the rest of us are working loads of overtime due to covering the open shifts from promoting one person out of the shift work pool, and then we had to support the missing supervisors on top of that. I stayed on because I didn't want to be the cause of this very situation.\n\nAt the end of this process, the supervisors learned that nobody really wanted to be a manager under this director. He was the type to say \"get this thing done\" and imply that you had the latitude to do it in whatever way you wanted, but would then chastise you for not doing it the way he wanted - despite not giving any guidance to that fact. One of the supervisors did take the manager position - he left shortly afterward. The training manager came back from maternity leave for a couple months - and then also left. \n\nThe happy ending to this all, is that I did end up getting another job offer. A good friend helped get me in the door with a great company, and I've been there since. I technically took a pay cut since I'm now salary and there's little to no overtime, but I'm off shift work and my quality of life went through the roof. I'm also now a work from home employee, so I have even more freedom.\n\nThe director gave me the most bullshit response when I took my notice to him. He told me he was \"really sorry to see me go\", \"he had big plans for me, and was hoping I could take on a bigger management role\", \"there are changes coming that I'll really be happy about\", but the real kicker - \"**but I won't do anything to keep you here**\".",

I explained to professor boomer that it wasn't the worker who lacked loyalty to the company, but the evidence was totally pointing toward the company not having any reciprocal loyalty to any employee. \n\nI actually cited not only Kmart.

And how this was common practice at that point and time. \n\nI reiterated that companies have long moved far away from the team spirited modality of old, where some companies actually built good relationships with their employees. Raises were non existent in a lot of professions, and that employees were, and still are, merely numbers in a tab of personnel files in HR.

I currently work in a small engineering firm (literally 3 people in payroll plus the occasional intern) and 95% of the things people say about companies doesn't apply here. A few examples:\n\n1) The company doesn't care for you and views you as a number.\n\nThe company's owner is my manager who is approx a decade older than I and we honestly have created an interesting friendship over the 3 years I've been here. Clearly there's still the authority gap but we all trust each other and he will buy lunch for us on a decently frequent basis. He also really cares about his employees being in a good mental and physical state.\n\n2) The only way you can increase your salary significantly is by jumping ship.\n\nI have been here for close to 3 years and with respect to my starting salary, I have gotten a 22% raise, with another raise coming up at the end of this year. So likely about 3.5years in I will be somewhere around 30% increase with respect to the starting salary.\n\n3) HR is there to protect the company and never you.\n\nHR would be my manager in this case, and he really cares about the growth and well being of his employees and will provide good feedback at appropriate times. Never a finger-pointer, always a problem solver.\n\nThe moral of the story is not all jobs and companies out there are cutthroat and stone-cold corporate. Sometimes your coworkers and even managers can be your friends in the right environment, mostly only small companies where \"financial margins\" and \"pleasing the stakeholders\" aren't the primary concerns for the company owner.",

Now more and more companies are moving to a standard raise across the board which is creating a “nomadic employee force”, as she called it. It’s not only the best way to grow your salary, but often times required to achieve raises that are greater than cost of living increases. It is also commonly the only way to diversify your expertise since sometimes you get pigeon holed in a job at a large company.   \n\n  My old company gave out a 2.5% increase across the board in 2019 yet the COL increase across the US was 2.8%, so everyone actually made less proportionally to what everything costs. Furthermore since I had gotten a 5% increase for a supervisory roll I had taken on 3 month prior to the annual raises, I was told I already got my increase and stiffed (0%) for the annuals.

            "text": "I nearly doubled my income by transitioning to a different Employer. I worked for my former employer for a little over 4 years. I did manage to get a promotion after 2 years of employment but it was only a pay increase of $2 an hour and was actually salary for the first year and a half, despite not paying me and my peers enough to meet the federal guidelines standard for salary employees. Once the law was passed which dictated the minimum amount a salaried employee could make, they continued to pay me and everyone else there far less than that amount for an additional 6 months after the fact. In addition to this, they dangled the carrot of an additional promotion for me for nearly the entire two years after my initial promotion. I took on 89% of my supervisors duties and still had all of my responsibilities as well, which led to regularly working 16 hour days, M-F, again with no overtime whatsoever or even pay addition as I was still salary. The company only stopped overworking myself and all of my salary peers once we were transitioned to hourly wages, which only happened once I composed and sent a formal missive to the Vice President, CEO, Human Resources Generalist, CFO, and my Supervisor along with the assertion that I could forward their response to State in order to acquire additional \"clarification\" if needed. Since I've begun working with my new employer I again am making nearly double what I was previously, in addition to having far more time off, a much more generous retirement program, remote work and overall better benefits, all with a fraction of the responsibility. Under no circumstances should you work for an employer that treats you as an exhaustible resource which exists only to serve their better interests as you will either continue to work at a dead end/miserable/low paying job, or they'll probably end up replacing you once they can pay someone even less to do what you do. There is no logical reason to assume that a company that does not value you will be interested in your best interests.",

A company has a better return letting you go, and replacing you with someone that they will get more longevity out of as they'll stay longer. \n\nA company will do this even if they end up paying your replacement more than the counter offer, as over the time frame countering to you is more expensive (less ROI) then paying more for a new employee and capitalising the expense. \n\nTL;DR In the eyes of a company, you are a product not a person, and as such, fungible.

A few people say you do a good job and if it appears that people 'depend on you' because you deliver such quality work, suddenly that means youre on a clear path to success.\n\nA LOT of money goes into manufacturing company culture to help companies not only avoid bad hires but to mitigate them leaving. You'd think a living wage or merit bumps in salary would be a part of this discussion, but as someone who has been in the room helping companies build out or change their culture, never once has merit pay increases been a part of that discussion. It's bad practice for a company to let any employee get to a point to where if they leave their fucked. Because at the end of the day, even if they do stay,  they eventually retire and that one person is now equal to 50. That's a legacy model that screwed over a lot of companies. So if you find yourself in a position where you feel you're needed, you just fucked yourself and the company for the sake of your ego. \n\nCompanies spend billions of dollars manufacturing a culture that rewards you in everything but pay increase, literally. And people *genuinely believe in it.* It's like when someone justifies a disappointing person by tagging on 'he's a really nice guy though' You get enough people with the mentality that 'this is a good place to work, nice people! I'm lucky! I should be grateful!' and salary suddenly drops from the list of things you can be open with about to your manager. \n\nFor some people this is genuinely a fine trade off. Some people would much rather live out their lives in a comfortable workplace and are satisfied with a 2-5% inflation pay increase. That's to the companies benefit too, as they dont have people leaving. It works both ways, if you leave your company for a higher paying position they'll likely hire someone at a higher salary than yours to fill your position.

Never let anyone sucker you or abuse you or hurt you financially. 100%.\n\nSecond of all- remember that there are numerous ways to maximize your long-term earnings.\n\nJob hopping is a great way to get a few boosts initially and put pressure on your current employer. At some point though you want to grow upwards in your career field. As a hiring manager, Im telling you- job hopping can limit your ability to grow outside of your current job title. Companies rarely turn people that have spent 8 months on the job at 8 different employers into managers and team leads. Hiring managers arent idiots. \n\n10 years of job hopping eventually stops looking attractive.\n\nIf you really want the good money, consider how you get into the upper echelons of your profession- management, leadership, decision-making. There is SERIOUS money there. Store managers at Publix that started off unloading creates from trucks make more money than a lot of software developers. Do things strategically.\n\nJob hop to get yourself in good positions. Then when you smell you have a chance to grow within a company, do that if it feels right. The point is- be strategic. You can increase your earnings both by growing vertically and horizontally. Dont follow shallow one dimensional advice blindly.",
