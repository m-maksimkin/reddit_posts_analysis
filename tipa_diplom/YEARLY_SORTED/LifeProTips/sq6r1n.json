My understanding is that, for researchers, there isn't meant to be a 1:1 economic incentive to be paid for the time and effort that goes into research studies, especially those that take a long time to conduct. Rather, the point is that publishing in these journals is required to indirectly profit by attracting grant money and private investment or earning tenure from their institution.

If you’re synthesizing an idea for a paper and need to do a lit review, do you really want to email 30 different authors for access to their papers, only for half of them to actually comply over the span of the next month? The real hierarchy here is database access > journal access > article access. \n\nAlso, I’m not sure why publishers are being thrown under the bus here. Sure, the publishing process can be dogmatic and sometimes a bit arbitrary, but journals essentially curate important research.
