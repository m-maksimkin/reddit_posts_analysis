As a short explanation I worked in high school then moved to college worked moved back home after a semester cause of financial problems then worked then moved to Georgia to be meet my dad who just got sober for the first time in my life and worked multiple jobs at a time and moved out of his apartment to another place in Georgia my own place then worked a different set of jobs then moved to NC to be with my girlfriend who id been dating for 4 years at that point and started working another set of jobs and have moved from some of those jobs onto owning my own company and working part time elsewhere. \n\nSo having a bit of experience in lots of different environments at different types of jobs i can honestly say it really depends on the company. I can walk in the door of a business and talk to one person that works there and tell you exactly what the problems are. Sometimes a business is always hiring because of bad turnover rates, could be a college town, could be a bunch of people quit all at once and they hired a big group of people after who also quit all at once and that keeps happening because the business is run very poorly. Could be that the managers have unrealistic expectations for their staff and they keep firing people because they cant live up to their expectations. It could also be that the company is growing at such a rapid pace and is really in need of people all the time.\n\nThese are just a few more common examples. You never really can know for sure why some place is always hiring so I suggest to anyone who is thinking about not inquiring about a job somewhere because they are always hiring just to go in and talk to some of the employees or the business owner. Go ahead and try to get a job there work there for a week and be ready to quit.\n\nLooking for a job is a lot like dating nowadays. If you look at a picture of them and decide off of their looks you could be really disappointed or miss out on a really good one. But what i see most is people are afraid to hop one job to another or even work multiple jobs. To find the right one for them. A lot of times this is why the shitty business are still going too. Businesses get away with treating people like garbage cause people keep going to work for them and staying in these jobs.",
