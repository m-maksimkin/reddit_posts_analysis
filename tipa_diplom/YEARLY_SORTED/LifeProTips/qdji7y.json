Both are very poor in protein which you actually need to normally function, but the difference is that ramen might actually get you a better stool and hydrate you more, as well as introduce minerals and vitamins you need, while potatoes do not even have any significant amount of fat and are more or less pure carbs.\n\nBoth have significant health concerns surrounding their consumptions, with potatoes being linked to higher cancer risk, and ramen linked to digestive problems (and possibly cancer as well). \n\nPotatoes are good when you pair them with some pork, as it will both provide a good source of protein and fat, while remaining fairly cheap. Throw in some pork liver and your set on vitamins and minerals as well.",

A bag of raw potatoes is $0.35/lb - $1/lb depending on type.\n* Like all un-fresh things, lower in Vitamin C which decays over time. Often pre-salted.\n\nYou might get some very odd looks from coworkers if decide to stir up a serving of garlic mashed potato out of a coffee cup during a day of overscheduled meetings, but if you really *need* to the option is there. :P",

When you're working multiple jobs paying off debt and have like 30 mins a day to eat in total, you'll quickly realize you ain't got the patience or mental energy to cook a bunch of potatoes in creative ways. The healthier alternative to ramen in this situation is actually canned beans.",

It‚Äôs also a fun community you will soon become a part of‚Ä¶and not social media, but the one you are already a part of. You will be shocked at how many people around you and in your life cook and want to share what they cook and how they do it. Ask questions, ask to help when you are around them.

The next three to five days leave the slice inside for 30 seconds more each time. The potatoes have astringent properties and help relieve the pain and itchy sensation which usually happens with this condition, while the ice cold potato constricts the blood vessels, reduces the swelling and relieves your pain instantly.‚Äù\n\nThis isn‚Äôt the first time doctors have needed to beg people not to insert food into a non-mouth orifice.

Most low income college people usually have a kettle and a small stove. If in better cases, a rice cooker. That leaves it boiling, which, trust me, is not good no matter how you season it. So then you have to rice or ground them to make mash.

Even with gadgets it will still taste like boiled ones. Potato is just as good as the ingredients you compliment it with so if you are strapped for cash chances are you will only have salt most of the time.

But in college I would go to two different stores and buy 4 bags for $10 plus tax. It was cold enough that I could leave them sealed up in a tub on the balcony of my apartment and they wouldn‚Äôt go bad. I was so poor but I would save enough money to splurge on real butter and good cheese and I would just eat potatoes I‚Äôm all forms for 3-4 weeks and it would be about $25 total for all of my meals during that time. \n\nI would supplement my potato diet with mini pb&j sandwiches that I‚Äôd make with the free bread and condiment packets from work. And I would also go to any lunch break presentation in college that offered food. Usually you just had to sit and listen to them give a presentation or talk about Jesus for 45 minutes and they‚Äôd give you free pizza or hot dogs.  Not the healthiest diet but I was doing my best.",
