Letting us quit meant the possibility of being rehired, which I took advantage of twice. \n\nThe second one I was at the end of a long probationary/training period and got the flu. I couldn't leave my bed for over a week. I thought I was using accrued sick leave at that point, but because I was Technically still a trainee, I could accrue it but not use it. My boss called me and said any more absences and I'd be automatically fired by the system, and again, blacklisted.

There are other countries that do it, but they are few and far in between. For the vast majority of the world, you get that regardless.\n\nSecondly, some countries have national registries which lists the base circumstance of your last employment ending (as in, if you quit, were fired, company went bust etc).\n\nThirdly, most employers will verify your previous employments, and ask previous employer about you. Like, how were you as an employee and such. Often, previous employers are actually forbidden from badmouthing you in these questions (in the US as an example that's considered to be interfering with a business relation which is a no no). They are however allowed to talk about things like that you were fired or that you quit. So even if there's no registry, your new employer will still know if you were fired, or quit. They can also answer that they can't comment on your performance as an example, which is pretty well understood to mean that your performance was bad but they can't actually say that as mentioned.\n\nBasically, don't take a strict approach either way on this... If it's a company that is well known for treating employees badly, then being fired won't really matter to a new employer since they'll then know that. Being fired from a respectable company though, and you're going to find that your future employment situation just became a LOT trickier if you're fired... So be careful about this and think through carefully how being fired from company X will look compared to quitting, because future employers either will know which it is, or you'll have a blank period in your CV for that work's duration which will also look really bad.",

It could be \"terminated\" (usually for grave offences, other cause, or when involved in major workplace accidents or damaging public reputation). Some organizations will not allow people with \"termination\" records. Some will not allow even applicants who were \"previously let go\" from applying.\n\nThe kicker is: Some private companies also use this rule to weed out applicants without resorting to criminal record investigation which is lengthy, difficult, and requires a good reason. There is no blanket national ban on previously-fired-from-the-government people, but companies use this as a cheap (virtually free) method to get people with \"cleaner\" (but not necessarily clean) records.\n\n\"Asked to resign\" has no such negative consequence, and goes on your reference letter simply as \"resigned\". Also, \"contract fulfilled\" (but not renewed) is another neutral reason to leave.\n\nIf you're sure, absolutely sure it's wrongful dismissal, you can take a stand. However, if it isn't and you decide to do so, you might be in deeper shit than you'd think.\n\nTLDR: Read your relevant laws carefully about how much can be disclosed before trying to take a stand.",

I don't but will throw in 4 weeks extra in lieu of a PIP on top of the standard severance because let's face it, neither of us want to go through the motions of pretending some people actually give a shit about the job they suddenly give a crap about. We pay COBRA for a bit to ease that cost.\n\nAnother to, always check the State Dept of Labor website. Some states allowed you to double dip severance and unemployment. Pay attention to your state max weeks and the costs. If you worked in a lower unemployment benefit state and no work remotely, consider changing your work state. Weigh your state unemployment, your taxes and act soon on it.",

Like 2 months payment if i resign etc etc, and you will actually leave on good terms. That is of course if you havent done anything illegal like stealing from the company regularly.\n\nAs an example during the toilet paper crisis i asked if i could take a roll or two from the company, and they said sure you can take 3 rolls if you need it. Its a tiny amount of money but that is not the issue.\n\nHowever there were other people who didnt ask and just decided to steal tp rolls, then the company got mad instead, and put up signs like \"if you are caught stealing tp rolls we might fire you\", at first i thought this was some misunderstanding because i was thinking about the rolls i took. So i called my boss again and asked if there had been a misunderstanding of some sort, and that i couldnt take the tp rolls. He said no there had not been a misunderstanding at all, i was free to take the tp rolls because i asked first.\n\nHowever a few people had it really hot behind their ears when the company found out they had stolen tp rolls, no one lost their job over it, but all of them had to pay for it, except me.\n\nSo instead of resigning understand that the company wants you to resign because its easier for them if you do, but use that as your own strength and argue for a severance package if you quit on your own accord. If they are forced to fire you they will be unhappy and might even give you a worse severance package as well. In fact they will want to do just that.",

The best recourse is to act a little emotional and tell them you weren’t expecting it at all and you need the job. Nobody likes to deal with that. Then ask for a day to think it over and then counter propose a timeline you’d need to find another job - 2 weeks, a month, 2 months. And only put in your papers when the boss has agreed to give you the said time.\n\nWaiting for the boss to fire you is just a bad situation for everyone. Your boss might not be evil. You might be incompetent or your role might not be relevant.",
