    "LPT: There is nothing tacky or wrong about discussing your salary with coworkers. It is a federally protected action and the only thing that can stop discrepancies in pay. Do not let your boss convince you otherwise.\nI just want to remind everyone that you should always discuss pay with coworkers. Do not let your managers or supervisors tell you it is tacky or against the rules.\n\nDiscussing pay with co-workers is a federally protected action. You cannot face consequences for discussing pay with coworkers- it can't even be threatened. Discussing pay with coworkers is the only thing that prevents discrimination in pay. Managers will often discourage it- They may even say it is against the rules but it never is. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilly_Ledbetter_Fair_Pay_Act_of_2009": [

I also emailed the office of the PM with a quick synopsis.\n\nSo now Justin Trudeau's office and his foundation's CEO is fully aware of the situation.\n\nSo if they don't help me out... I'm going to the media to speak out against Pascale Fournier and Justin Trudeau ignoring a sexual harassment complaint filed by his own family member against an abusive employer. Journalists have already expressed interest in writing an exposé about this employer.\n\nIf Justin does nothing about this, then I'll know what kind of man he really is.\n\nI worked for the Bronfmans. I opened their mail for them and read their correspondence and delegated that corresponce to appropriate staff members or security or to the Bronfmans themselves if it was unusual and related to family affairs.\n\nSo I know without a doubt Justin's personal assistant and/or security is going to see my emails and correspondence to him. This is almost 100% guaranteed.\n\nSo if they don't respond and do the right thing and help protect me from this abusive piece of shit employer of mine, we will all know it's because Justin Trudeau is a piece of shit too.\n\nOnly pieces of shit refuse to help distant family members when they're being bullied and sexually harassed by their employer.\n\nThis is literally what has been going on in my life the past week.",

People attach a lot of personal stuff to these things, and not everyone wants those personal things out in the open.\n\nThat said, you CAN talk about salary information.  No one can stop you from doing so.  The question is, should you talk about salary information.

No, it really won’t.  If someone is being paid more than you to do the same job, do you have all the facts as to why?  You definitely don’t… that’s confidential and with HR.  and you’re not going to beat it out of that person, either.

There are ways to know if you're under- or over-paid by looking at sites like Glassdoor, Blind, Payscale, or asking your career management center at your alma mater for anonymized alumni salary info. These are just a few ways. Asking your coworkers is a no win situation: if they're making more than me, I'll feel like shit and likely resent them, and if they're making less than me, they'll feel like shit *and* I risk them going to the manager with this info, and in one genius stroke, I've soured my equation both with my coworker (who now resents me because I make more) and my boss (who won't see me as trust-worthy, or may see me as a trouble-maker, etc). It's all fine and dandy to post the wiki link to the Fair Pay Act, blah blah, but that's not how the real world works. People get paid differently, and often at odds with the value they provide, because it's all political. It's not fair, I hate it, but \"transparent discussions around pay with coworkers\" will *NOT* solve this. Your employer can still choose to pay you whatever they like - the only leverage you have is whether you decide to stay or leave. That's the \"beauty\" of at-will employment. So do your external salary research, be strategic, and leave the company for another one if you can get more pay.\n\nBottom-line: it doesn't matter if *you* think your employer should pay you more. Sally, Susan, or Peter with the same title as you making more is not a good enough reason and it's a waste of energy and time, worse it amounts to self-sabotage, to focus on this. Instead, figure out what your market value is, position yourself in the right way, and go to the right company. And keep moving till you're satisfied with your compensation.",

An employee of mine came to my office upset that the guy on the floor made $5 more an hour than him. I pulled out a sheet of productivity metrics. The guy next to him finished 15 more peices a day than he did. We made around $30 profit per peice. That meant every day the higher paid employee made the company $450 more per day. So paying him $40 per day more made sense. The guy admitted he was slower and left the office agreeing with me but still annoyed. The day before he found out that he made less the guy was happy with what he was making. The day after he is unhappy and started causing problems.

Then she said it was being raised at my location, and that everyone was lucky because they were getting raises but she wasn't and that she 'wasnt complaining' because, 'the job isnt rocket science, its not that hard' (coming from a salaried manager who works 60+ hours a week because otherwise there arent enough hours for people to get shit done)\n\nI counter with 'a living wage isnt that much to ask for, and just because you're fine with being undervalued doesnt meam the rest of us are.'

I should be making, pathetically, at least $11.90 to reflect my raises.\n\nAnyways, I am 'not allowed' to tell that to anyone and I didnt know I was able to do so. But also, I work in an at will state, so they can fire me at any time, so they can technically fire me for telling people, but pretend its for something else, so really in this case the protections are just nothing.\n\nWhat good is such a protection when it is so easily circumvented?

You can either work more and get paid more, or you can work less but have more free time. She chose more free time and I chose more work.",

We wrote the letter and 1 week before we handed it in we had a huge company meeting, they told us they were redoing our piece rate system and everyone would have their pay adjusted.  They also were giving us back 5 pto days due to covid and introducing profit sharing at the end of the fiscal year.  Someone in management got tipped off to our letter but they took it as a call to action instead of a reason to fire us.  It's been 3 weeks since we all had that meeting and every single person at my company has gotten a raise. Some more then others but our management laid out a clear advancement system for raises.  For someone who was on their way out the door this was a huge gesture of good faith, I'm still hesitant to stay long time if these changes don't continue to trend up but it's nice to be apart of a positive workplace reform.  \nWe also still decided to hand the letter in as it dealt with much more then just the pay scaling.

            "text": "As a manager, I understand this but I also feel like it’s never this cut and dry. It just feels like federal government overreach with the thought process of protecting employees, but in reality it is far more complicated… \n\nMy company compensates with salary & profit sharing for most employees, we also have commissions. Essentially everyone in the company is compensated on their performance, not job title. \n\nA great example of this, is that I have two guys that work for me that have the same title. A has been with the company 24 years and B has been with the company 3 years. B made 20% less salary than A, but with profit sharing B made twice as much as A at the end of the year. Why? Because despite B only being with the company for 3 years he has sold 350% more than A did, and A has 1/2 of the ancillary responsibilities that B does. A is really only still employed because he’s not a bad employee, he still shows up on time and if he’s asked to do something he does it, but his sales performance isn’t good. \n\nSo, what happens if employee A & B talk to each other and employee A comes and talks to me because employee B got paid twice as much? Does he see / understand the difference in their responsibilities / workload that resulted in the pay gap? Probably not. He probably also doesn’t understand that our his compensation is roughly 40% better than our main competitors average compensation for the same position or that if he asks for more money then he’ll get the same answer as B did 18 months ago; “you need to do more”. Which is exactly what I told him 3 months ago at annually review when I asked him if he wanted to make more money, and then wrote out a performance improvement / incentive plan that he hasn’t done the first thing on. \n\nSo In this hypothetical situation what am I now supposed to do? The reality of the situation is, is that I have employee C who is a sales trainee that’s 3 months into the job and almost has the same workload as the A the 24 year vet. Salary wise I pay employee C 1/3 of what I pay employee A and if A wants to make a stink then it’s not fair to B or C that I keep him around because they already somewhat view him as a cancer to the organization because of his lack of production. \n\nThe federally protected “right” to talk about compensation in this situation (what I said above is actually true - just applying the hypothetical of A talking about his compensation) may end up costing the guy his job depending on his approach. Not because he decided to talk about his pay, but because frankly he’s overpaid for what he does - but he’s not paid as much as his peer and it literally, mathematically based on his sales, doesn’t make sense to pay him more…  and if he decides to go work for our competitor a 40% pay cut that goes along with that. Ultimately, I like employee A, and If he were to do more I would ultimately pay him more.. but he won’t, so I can’t. \n\nI know there are likely thousands of situations out there that this law will help with pay disparity.. but I can’t help but think that there are thousands of situations where it probably benefits people to shut up as well…",

But, I think it's critical that people know and understand what they are worth in the market - and they should have this discussion with their manager as often as needed.\n\nOutside of unskilled labor, a person's pay / value doesn't have a lot to do with job title. For instance, many job titles may have a pay \"scale\" that varies by tens of thousands of dollars - that isn't meant to be discriminatory, it just may mean that someone may hold that title for a number of years and / or one person may bring far more value to the position than another person - yet both can grow within that position - and eventually provide equal value. Remember, merit increases over the years also factor in, not just performance.\n\nThe bottom line is this: know what you're worth and manage it with your manager - you have to manage your compensation - there's no need to worry about someone else's.\n\nI've had times where employees say \"based on this information I've found on the internet, I should be making $x\" - and I've been able to work with that person to help them understand that the position they researched has a set of responsibilities that they aren't ready for - and help them get on that path - it's a healthy conversation. At the same time, I've had this situation end with me also believing that the employee may be under-compensated and work with the organization to see where we sit - and adjust as needed - which honestly, is my favorite outcome. Larger companies tend to be better at this, because they normally have some compensation analysis tools available to them. Frequently, they'll catch discrepancies in pay before anyone else brings it up.\n\nIn a white collar environment, open discussion of compensation can be incredibly toxic - and serves nobody well. I'm always happy to discuss compensation with employees - ALWAYS.... and I personally work for money, not love.....and I encourage my employees to do what needed to maximize their value to the company, and maximize the size of their paychecks - and I am always willing to help both happen - just as I try to be honest if  / when someone might have unrealistic expectations.",

Some companies will actually give incentives to management teams who get labor costs down and usually they do this by fucking over workers’ wages (I call it double dipping). This is how they do it in the restaurant/hotel industry. I co-owned a restaurant but I was really just a slave to the other owners and things are set up in a lot of businesses to have so much gray area around payroll and labor. I remember once when I was trying to keep the other owners happy by cutting down labor by like 12% which (if you know anything about any business) was huge down from 35.3% to 22.8% and then down to 21.1%. This was a really disruptive process for employees financially and probably one of the worst mistakes I've ever made in business. Our best employees left and the ones that stayed got other part time jobs that made them give a shit less about this one which I understood and I would soon have the same experience myself. The other owners (the investors in the business maybe showed up physically twice in two years of ownership) Also, In that process there were so many opportunities for me to fuck employees out of wages they didn't even know they were entitled to. Like, one of my servers made $400 in a night she fucking killed it but the way our system worked is we didn't have enough cash to tip her out that night so I gave her $250 and the other $150 was to go on her paycheck at the end of the week. In between those two days to process (that 150 is in limbo now) I can keep that cash because when she gets her check she only knows her ‘percieved’ income because it always varies. I accidentally forgot to put it on her check and enveloped $150 in cash (something I typically do so high volume servers don't have to pay that much taxes as it's not recorded as income) and gave it to her *bows my head in shame* two months later when I found it in the bottom of her ‘drop’ in my filing cabinet. If she wasn't one of my close friends (who would go on to help me close this disaster) it could have been a huge problem. But if I didn't see the envelope and give her the cash she never would have noticed it was missing income in the first place, get me? I have four more instances just like this in similar ‘incentive’ or commission-based industries.

These people are fucking reptiles and they will rob you blind. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS keep a close eye on your wages and educate yourself legally as a worker. It’ll make you harder to hire because you won't be advertised as a slave which is what every management team in the universe wants, but it'll be worth it not getting fucked in the ass by the no condom wearing shit-eating Chad that will be stealing your wages while, trying to make up for it karmically by throwing you a surprise birthday party.\n\nTL;DR Eat the rich",
