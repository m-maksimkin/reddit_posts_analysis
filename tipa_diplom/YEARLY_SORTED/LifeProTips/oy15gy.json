Ads are one thing but Vizio was catched sending images back to recognize what the user is watching. Some \"smart\" TVs have webcam and microphone integrated, they usually have plenty of security holes and never get updated to fix any (there is no incentive for older ones).\n\nJust for 20-30 dollars you can get a Android Tv/Fire TV/Apple TV/Roku that would be compatible with most streaming services and you have more capacity to control the experience. You also can always replace if the company behind it ends up putting ads on being annoying.\n\nEdit: For even more control you can get an Android TV like Walmart's Inn 4k ($30). Two days ago somebody on XDA released an alternative ROM that can be flashed after unlocking the boot loader. This means you can get the latest Android TV experience on it and also have root capabilities (= full control). I know this is not for everyone but is easier thank it looks.
