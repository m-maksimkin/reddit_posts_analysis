    "LPT: Guys-Get your colonoscopies\n \n\nI'm 48 years old. A little over ten years ago I was in the car pickup line at my daughter's school. She was in second grade. It was a warm spring day so we were all standing around outside our cars. This chubby guy was standing outside an orange Mini Cooper. I nodded and made the random nice car comment. He said its name was Oliver. Oh, like Hammond's car in Top Gear? His eyes lit up. Friendliest guy in the world, he came over and we started chatting. Found out we had nearly everything in common, and were best friends from that moment forward.\n\nIt's so rare to make any friends in your 30s with a family, much less a best bud. Our daughters were the same age and were immediate best friends too. Same with our wives. It was weird, we were all so much alike and got on so well. I helped them move, Joe helped me with some projects at home. We went to see Deadpool about a dozen times.\n\nLast summer Joe, in his early 40s, had been having some stomach issues for a few weeks, then passed out at work. They did tests. Found a sizeable tumor in his colon. Chemo. Surgery. Complications. Another surgery. Another. More chemo when the last surgery found that the cancer had \"spread significantly.\"\n\nJoe was brought home from the hospital a couple days ago to be put in hospice. My wife and I are going over to see him later this afternoon.\n\nTo say goodbye.\n\nI'm loading up a couple episodes of Top Gear on my tablet and am going to just sit with my buddy one more time.\n\nGuys... Get checked. Get your colonoscopies. If something doesn't feel right, go to the doctor immediately and get it checked.\n\n-----------\nEditing to add because it looks like a common question. I'm no doc but I saw a GI doc comment that the current recommendation is for all adults over 45 to get a colonoscopy, potentially earlier if you have family history. \n\nAnd thank you everyone for the kind words. Wife and I are about to head over to Joe's. Gotta hold it together for him. I can cry in the car afterward.\n\n------------\nEvening edit. Got to sit with my buddy for awhile. He mostly slept. Woke up a couple times and held my hand. It was good to see him and remember all the laughs. Made it home before I bawled my eyes out.": [

Back then, it was obviously a very different procedure so he had no desire to go through that again. He had a very crappy doctor who didn't recommend having one and a wife who didn't insist on one. By the time we managed to actually FIND a doctor who would perform a colonoscopy on a 91 year old, it was too late and he died in June of 2021.

I thought it was \"normal\" for a long time.  Had a kid, and it was when she was just 3 years old that I realized I had a huge problem.  I couldn't finish rocking her to sleep, I had to use the toilet for the 6th time that day and it just didn't feel normal. While waiting for the doctor's appointment, I was in so much pain trying to go, I had to call in help to watch my kid. My lower stomache actually quivered at all the cramping pain.  \n\nFor too long I avoided a colonoscopy. Because I wasn't over 50, my insurance wasn't going to pay the more than $2500 bill unless something was found.  Well, at my breaking point, something was found. A tumor blocking 80% of my lower colon.  Stage 3b adenocarcinoma. I had to do the colonoscopy prep twice in two weeks, the second time to remove the tumor.  They advised I may have a stoma, which scared me.  Thankfully i woke up with no stoma, the surgeon said I had the tumor in the most fortunate spot to avoid one. Clean lines. 6 months worth of clean up chemo. \n\nWhile in the cancer center having chemo administered surrounded by dozens of other cancer fighters, i would overhear conversations around me. One conversation in particular really disturbed me. An elderly cancer fighter, very gaunt, thin, really just so thin.... had someone accompanying her, trying to comfort her by saying \"you were loved\" and \"everyone loved you\"... everything she said was past tense and the woman was still with us, right there in the chair next to me.\n\nTwo years later, my mother has stage 4 small bowel cancer.  My oncologist gave her 6 months. I didn't fully understand what was happening. I took her to chemo appointments and watched her slowly fade. I made it a point to tell my mom \"I love you\" in the present tense, regularly. She insisted on being moved to a nursing home for hospice care, she didnt want to burden us and she knew her house would be creepy if she died there. Hospice care nurse didn't get a hold of me until it was too late.\nI wasn't with her when she passed.

It's strange, but when it's developing, it doesn't necessarily feel like some big bad thing is happening to you - especially if you are even REMOTELY used to having one of these symptoms regularly.\n\nI think at this age, it is very easy to assume these are things related to the aging process. If you don't feel good, I implore you to seek answers.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to get to know your poops! It's a little embarassing to say, but in all of this, I've learned how much your poop says about the inside of your digestive tract!! \nKnow how to look for blood, pay attention to any pain, or how regular you are.

My first report was that I was \"a polyp farm of precancerous growths\".  At 45, I was having them every two years.  S\n\nShortly after that, one year or two, I had a massive polyp enveloping the cecum.  That was so bad I had to have it surgically removed.  The GI doc at the time, who skeptical of all the colonoscopies I kept having, said that was a \"silent killer\".  Probably the kind that killed my maternal grandmother.\n\nRemember the tragedy that took Katie Couric's husband.\n\n[https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a35863226/katie-couric-husband-jay-monahan-colon-cancer/](https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a35863226/katie-couric-husband-jay-monahan-colon-cancer/)\n\nAfter the first few colonoscopies, I got over the disgusting prep and it became \"routine\".  Then I got frustrated with waiting for the anesthesia and getting a ride to and from the hospital.  (I always had to have them done in hospital because the docs were convinced that I'd need emergency surgery.)  So I began to skip the anesthesia to the amazement of everyone.  (At worst it was a little uncomfortable. And, it did allow me to \"help\" the doc by moving around on his direction to get the probe \"up the republic\".  Laugh!  I get to watch the \"expensive plumber\" at work and we crack jokes. \n\nI wouldn't call it \"fun\", but going almost directly from the operating room to the exit was a hoot.\n\nSo, my strong advice it \"get over it\" and get the procedure done.

Until my mom, an anesthesiologist, called and said she had just done a procedure on a gent his age, with a younger wife around my age, and the findings were not favorable. (No HIPAA info shared)\n\nSo my husband goes to his PCP for the referral. PCP listens to his heart, says “huh” then listens again. Then calls down to cardiology to get him seen that day. \n\nCardiology finds a prolapsed mitral valve causing a pronounced murmur. We schedule a repair, he gets the surgery with the daVinci robot (my hubs is a robotics nut), and he now has 2 goretex grafts, 3 fading scars under his right arm, and has just recently come off the beta blockers. This all because it was caught early and treated before it became a bigger issue.\n\nAnd yes, he got the colonoscopy, which was all clear.",

The blood test came back normal but the bloody stool kept happening and sometimes it was quite a lot. After voicing my concerns again, my doctor scheduled a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy showed that I did indeed have some pretty severe hemorrhoids and diverticulitis, which were the cause of the bloody stools. Stools. However, I also had several precancerous polyps that would have gone unnoticed for years had I not gotten the colonoscopy and quite possibly developed into colon cancer. After talking to my gastroenterologist and a dietitian I have adjusted my diet to have more fiber, and the hemorrhoids are more or less gone. But now I have to have a colonoscopy every 5 years because of the polyps. You are never too young to get a colonoscopy, especially if you have concerns.",

At my 2nd colonoscopy more polyps we're found and removed. I'm sure more will be found this time too. The point to all of this is the polyps from the first colonoscopy would have been cancer by now if they had not been removed. It generally takes polyps 7-10 years to develop into cancer if they are the type to do so. Everyone needs to start pushing for colonoscopies at younger ages.

            "text": "Cannot agree with this enough.  Late 2017 / early 2018 I was suffering from increasing abdominal pain & digestive issues.  I'm in my early 40s and wrote off the discomfort as any number of things - too much spicy food, too much caffeine, aging, slowing metabolism.\n\nI'm not sure when it started for me, or how long it lasted.  All I know is started \"small\", but got to the point where I was in so much pain I was losing sleep.  I was gainfully employed with decent insurance, but I'm the type to avoid doctors (and more importantly, medical costs) altogether if I can.  Finally I went in - numerous scans, and blood work, and tests.\n\nThey found a sizeable growth (6 to 8 inches) on my colon.  The initial diagnosis was colon cancer.  Colonoscopy was scheduled, as was an appointment with the oncologist (same doctor, if memory serves).  Those appointments didn't happen as planned - on a Friday morning I left work, excused of course, to go to the Emergency Room.  I hadn't slept a wink the night before, no exaggeration, and the pain was excruciating.\n\nMy parents, both retired, drove me to the hospital and stayed with me all day.  More scans were scheduled and meeting with countless doctors and nurses and hospital staff.  Needless to say, I wasn't going home.  Colonoscopy bumped up to the following day, but I didn't even get that far.  You see, that night I couldn't chug down whatever liquid they want you to drink to flush out your system.  The simple act of drinking fluid made my stomach feel like it was about to explode.  I hadn't eaten anything that day, and now I can't swallow this liquid that tastes similarly to how nail polisher smells.  It was late and they dosed me up a little so I could sleep through the pain.\n\nThe next morning I was woke early and told they were going to operate.  Emergency surgery by the oncologist and his team to excise what they believed to be a massive tumor.  I called my parents, who were in the process of getting ready to come down.  But they wouldn't arrive in time, as I was soon hauled off via gurney to the operating room.\n\nI woke, or was conscious, about 8 hours later.  I had IVs in each arm, a tube inserted in my nose leading to my stomach, pumping out the contents of my stomach.  And worst of all, a major incision from sternum to waistline.  They cut me open, pulled my intestines out and excised the growth, which also attached itself to my appendix (so that came out, too).  About 10 to 12 inches of intestine was removed.  Keep in mind, no colonoscopy was performed and the doctors had no chance to flush the contents of my digestive tract or stomach.\n\nNeedless to say, it was a helluva lot of work by the surgery team on that day.  I was scared and in tons of pain still and wearing a f\\*\\*king colostomy bag.  I told the doctor in the ER I'd k\\*ll myself if forced onto a bag.  But upon waking up, I was happy to have my life and knowing that no matter the cost, I was mostly out of danger.  \n\nThinking back on it, I was so foolish for trying to tough it out.  I'm crying a little even now, 3 years later, as I don't talk about it much and never to strangers.  As it turns out, it wasn't cancer but just a strange growth caused possibly by swallowing something like a chicken bone fragment.  That little sharp thing lodged into my intestinal wall and my body responded by growing more of that intestinal flesh, growing inward and outward from itself, constricting the flow of waste like a shrinking bottleneck.\n\nAll of that is to say, take care of yourself.  Especially if you have the insurance to do so.  The earlier you do, the better off you'll feel (physically and financially).  The smallest thing could snowball into something much bigger until it gets away from your, any doctor's, control.  The recommended age for your first colonoscopy, I believe, is around 50.  But given the kinds of stuff we put in our bodies these days, I would say maybe it should be 40.  Even my surgeon thought so.  And if you're experiencing discomfort and irregularity, don't delay - get it checked out.  Thanks for allowing me to tell my story.",

After having some issues for a year and a half I finally convinced my doctor to order a colonoscopy at age 57. Three years short of the recommended 10 years. Turns out I had stage 3 rectal cancer. I have since had to have MULTIPLE colonoscopies as well as multiple sigmoidoscopies. Sigmoidoscopies are worse. A sigmoidoscopy only looks at the lower part if your colon. You don’t have to do a colonoscopy prep but you do have to give yourself two enemas. And this is the important part: you are completely awake with NO sedatives of any kind, face down on on a table with your butt propped up, sometimes with multiple doctors viewing your behind. \n\nPutting off a colonoscopy now could result in MANY colonoscopies/sigmoidoscopies in the future. \n\nFor those that need even more motivation here is a quick synopsis of what I went through:\n\nChemo (pill) and radiation five days a week for five weeks which required a 90 minute each way commute. Surgery to remove two lymph nodes and the lower 26 inches of my lower colon and rectum. They attached the severed colon to my anus with a staple gun and 100 staples. During the surgery they also gave me an ileostomy. An ileostomy is like a colostomy but at the juncture of the colon and small intestine. I then had my stomach contents diverted into an ostomy bag through a hole in my gut for six months. I had three months of chemo. Every other week I had 48 hours of chemo through a port in my chest which was given via a contraption I had to hang from my neck. Then I had another surgery to reverse the ileostomy. \n\nThankfully, I am now almost six years NED (no evidence of disease) and still here to tell my story. \n\nMy advice is bite the bullet and get your colonoscopies.

For my last 2 I wanted to stay awake so I took less sedation and maintained a conversation with my doctor. I always find I forgot what questions to ask if I don't ask them immediately and it's nice seeing my colon and his reactions when he finds the inflammation. \n\nMany are also scared of the prep. It's also not so bad. It's a single day of not eating and 3-4 trips to the bathroom. They can be intense but a few days leading up to your prep try to eat a little less in general. Avoid meat heavy meals and eat more soluble fiber like oats to get things moving down there. \n\nLuckily so far I haven't had anything that looks like cancer.

Even if one person in your family has/had colon cancer, check with your doctor.\n\nMy mom, along with three of her siblings all developed colon cancer before that age of 50. She is one of six, so four out of the six had colon cancer. Their dad (my grandpa) died before the age of 50 due to colon cancer. My mom was diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome, I later tested and was diagnosed with lynch syndrome at 27. Lynch syndrome is hereditary and puts you at a higher risk of developing colon cancer before 50. One of the six that didn’t have colon cancer was tested for Lynch syndrome and doesn’t carry it, meaning her kids won’t carry it either. \n\nAs for me, I have done three colonoscopies so far and will be testing every year because I have Lynch syndrome and such a high family rate of colon cancer. This last colonoscopy, I was the youngest patient by far at the hospital, so much the nurses all asked why I was getting them done so young, all shocked about the family history and the syndrome. \n\nBy far the worst part of the colonoscopy is the prep, you can’t eat anything the day before and need to take the bowel prep medication (doesn’t taste good and you poop a lot). This past one, they gave me a ton of drugs, fentanyl, Benadryl and something else, I was so high out of my mind that I told my wife the same story multiple times.

Nothing more than what would feel like a muscle pain from working out, or just a minor upset belly. Hemoglobin came back in the basement, immediately sent to ER. He received some blood, they came to the conclusion that he had an ulcer, bleeding internally somewhere, but not to worry, it was nothing serious. They tried to discharge him, told him to come back for a colonoscopy, but “it’s not urgent, so it might be a few weeks or so.” I had this terrible gut feeling that something was wrong, just something in my gut told me not to leave the hospital until he got a colonoscopy. The doctor tried to push us out - they don’t do colonoscopies on Saturdays, your insurance won’t cover it if you stay, we need the beds (this was 4 years ago so pre-covid), etc. My husband wasn’t thrilled to stay, but I just had this feeling we shouldn’t, not until he had the colonoscopy. \n\nTwo days later, he had a colonoscopy. They couldn’t even get 5 minutes into it, huge tumor blocking their path. Stage 3 high-risk colon cancer. In the lymph nodes. I think about it now and my hands start to shake thinking what could have happened and how it could have progressed if we couldn’t get in for an outpatient colonoscopy for a few weeks. And believe me, I work in healthcare, I get that it’s important to look for the simplest solution first, but we shouldn’t have been *scared* into not getting an urgent screening. \n\nHe’s fine now, in remission. It was a hard road, so hard, but we were lucky. But why did I have to BEG to have him stay, why did I have to BEG and refuse to leave until they gave him a colonoscopy? We all know insurance makes it hard, but why was it so hard to get someone to listen?

At 11 am my doctor called me and told me to go the the hospital because of “disturbing results”. They couldn’t get me a bed so he prescribed meds and told me to take it easy for the weekend. That Monday another outbreak and needed up in the ER. Spent 3 days in the hospital and they came to the conclusion I should have that part of my colon removed because of my age and how many outbreaks I had. First, they wanted to do a colonoscopy just to see how bad it was. They pulled a 1” large polyp out and sent me on my way and said they would test it as a precaution. It wound up being cancerous. My nurse at my doctors office couldn’t believe it and kept repeating “you weren’t supposed to have this test until your 50”. If it wasn’t for the diverticulitis it would have probably gone undetected for another 10 year and who know how far it could have spread. They still went ahead with the planned surgery to remove 1 foot of my colon and it was clean. I have two more colonoscopies at my 3 and 5 year mark to be officially cancer free. But I’m thankful every day for how it happened for me. \n\nAny pain or discomfort, please let your doctor know.

They found out when it leaked out his stitches. \n\nMore surgery to drian his bladder hoping it would heal.  3 different tubes/bags out in (1 into each kidney and one through his butt cheek to the bladder fistandulus) plus the catherator.  For like 4 month's.\n\nHe went back to work in the new year, as healed as he will ever be.  I'm going to stay with him for a week in April.  Unfortunately I haven't seen him since before the cancer in person as we live in different parts of the country and I have young children.  But we message all the time and play video games.  While he was in the hospital last summer I would stream games so he could watch when he was awake and we would talk.\n\nCancer sucks.  But most of it can be fixed if caught early.  Get screened.  If something doesn't seem right get it checked.  My friend waited to long and it was way worse.",

After hearing this he agreed. Him, mom & I all went to the same gastroenterologist. He retired recently. As my mom got more frequent follow ups and as she aged she wanted me to be there with her throughout the procedure to hold her hand. Our MD was just fine with it, even though I’m not a medical professional. Dr. Getzug really got it. He was awesome. Never talked down to us, listened to us and had such a sincere bedside manner. I swear, he knew off the bat exactly how much to put into the IV. we never felt or remembered a thing.",

The flaxseed oil coupled with my normal sluggist bowels had nearly turned my bowels to concrete... at least according to my gastroenterologist.\n\nDuring the colonoscopy my doctor found 4 polyps, 3 of which were precancerous. Had I waited until the standard age 50 they likely would have already turned cancerous.\n\n(I thank god for those flaxseed oil capsules or else it wouldn't have triggered that severe episode of constipation and those polyps wouldn't have been discovered.)\n\nI've had 2 colonoscopies since then and everything has been clear. Yay!\n\nFor those who want to know what a colonoscopy procedure involves, read on. I've been shocked to hear what people think a colonoscopy involves! One of my brother's friends thought it involved being on an exam table naked and on all fours.  :-o\n\nBefore the procedure, you're given medication that will clean out your colon. It's basically a very strong laxative. You'll have to fast for 1 day prior so the laxative is more effective.\n\nYou're given propofol aka \"the Michael Jackson drug\" through an IV during the procedure. It's lovely and feels as though you've taken a wondrously refreshing nap. You wear a gown and plush fuzzy socks (the surgery rooms are cold). You lie on your side during the colonoscopy.\n\nYou are in the room with the doctor, at least one nurse, and an anaesthesiologist. After you're under anaesthesia, the doctor inserts a tiny camera into your colon to investigate and take photos.\n\nWhen you wake up from anaesthesia, the doctor will talk with you about the results and show you the photos. You may even receive a copy of the photos (I did!).\n\nYou cannot drive yourself home or take an Uber or public transit. A trust friend or family member must pick you up and take you home. However, considering you haven't eaten in about 2 days, you'll probably want to head to the nearest restaurant first.  :)",

Another six weeks, and it would’ve been cancer. They had me come back a month later for another one, trying to remove it, and had to leave me on the table for 20 minutes till the bleeding stopped. Still couldn’t get it out. The second time, the doctor didn’t mark the spot with the tattoo needle like they did the first time, so when they took me in for surgery, the surgeon couldn’t find it. He couldn’t feel it, either, so instead of having to take out 6 inches of colon, he took out 2 feet. You have 8 feet, so I’m still 3/4 as full of shit as I used to be, which is still a significant amount. My fiancée was so freaked out she had one done. She was about a year away from cancer.

Lastly, a knee injury that forced him to go cuz he couldn't walk.\nHe passed away from a massive heart attack.  If he had even had the bare minimum checkups they may have found a heart issue.
