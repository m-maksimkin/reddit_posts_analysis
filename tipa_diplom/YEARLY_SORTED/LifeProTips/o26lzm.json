She was considerate, and excellent listener, and constantly made sure everyone on her team has a project they could run that they could take credit for and use as leverage for advancing. The only thing she wasn’t great at was advocating for a better salary, for herself or for her team. There was a process to it and she was intimidated by the male-dominated group that controlled it. It is what it is. \n\nBut, after a decade working for her I had, through one of her ‘here have a project’ initiatives, stumbled into a brand new career path that got me a promotion and a raise. Not a huge one, but the title was the big thing. It was enough to get me recruited by a more ‘prestige’ company in the new path I was on. And now, three years after that, I’m about to start at another job in the same space that is similarly reputable and recognized. In fact, I had two competing offers, and was able to be picky about where I went to make sure it was somewhere I’d actually want to be and stay.  \n\nAnd I’ll be making nearly 5x what I was making 5 years ago. \n\nAnd literally none of it would happen if my old boss hadn’t seen something in me and said ‘let’s see what he can do with it.’",

As an enlisted member of the army, part of getting a promotion is going to a promotion board. The board is all people who are higher ranking than you. They ask questions about any and everything. They basically determine your fate. Part of going to the board is having a sponsor, who is generally your first line supervisor. There are times a sponsor can be the reason someone fails their board. This is uncommon, but not unheard of.*\n\nIt was my time to go to the promotion board. My first line supervisor at the time was the best leader I’ve ever had. He was part of why I loved where I was working. My section leader(think 3rd line supervisor) decided that my second line supervisor was going to be my sponsor. This ends up leading to a meeting between me and supervisors 1-3. Supervisor 3 tells me that supervisor 2 is going to be my sponsor because it may be the deciding factor in her getting promoted. I told supervisor 3 that I didn’t believe supervisor 2 wouldn’t represent me because she doesn’t know me. \n\nSupervisor 3 asks why I think that way. I looked at supervisor 2 and asked her “what’s my wife’s name?” She didn’t know my wife’s name! How does she know me if she doesn’t know my wife’s name?! Not only did my first name know her name, but he knew our anniversary! My 3rd supervisor decided that wasn’t relevant enough and that supervisor 2 was taking me to the board. I refused to go to the board in that instance and that started the standstill my career. This started a chain what took the department from “the place to be” to the place that nobody wanted to work. \n\nMoral of the story: KNOW THE PEOPLE YOU’RE IN CHARGE OF!",

Businesses always need someone who is willing to acknowledge they may not know the specific industry or business sector but are willing to learn it and bring something of value to the table.

The animatronics company had been a customer for a couple of years and eventually I was put on the account. During quarantine last year, I was working from home. I reapplied to that company, they called me in for an interview, and offered me a job. No one at my job was mad. They may have been disappointed, but ultimately knew it was my dream job.  \n\n\nI only worked for them for about 7 months. They were ran so terribly, the work and my coworkers weren't worth it. I'd been spoiled at my previous job with nice benefits, a structured work environment, and set tasks. Thankfully my previous job took me back and now, I'll happily retire from here.  \n\n\nThis isn't to say \"dont ever get your dream job\". Go! Get your dream job! Work for your dream company! But if it starts to suck, listen to your gut. Don't cling onto it because it was your dream job. Just smile, appreciate the opportunity you had, and move on. This isn't a Hollywood movie.

That was nearly 25 years ago, and they've never recovered. \n\nI have been self-employed ever since.

I could do it in my sleep, starting on day one. But halfway down the page of requirements, it said something along the lines of \"This will be a busy position, and you will not have time for a home business or side hustle.\" \n\nAnd with that, I was out. Dude, I work for me. YOU are the side hustle. I don't need some middle management slicker breathing down my neck and micromanaging my every move. I OWN, and have owned, companies. I don't think like a middle tier wage-slave like you, I think like your boss's boss's boss. I think like an owner.

And only after did I realize that IT is the most under appreciated, misunderstood, and poorly managed fields on the planet earth. The amount of knowledge you have to hold in mental cannon, the amount of information you have to have ready mental access to, the work you have to put in, is completely insane. The higher you get the more you just get paid the same or slightly more, and as you take the reigns of your environment you quickly start doing the jobs of several people by yourself. Very few people know anything about what is happening behind the scenes, and management types unfortunately even less so though there are exceptions. What is expected of you is often literally impossible. \n\nI was waking up at 5:30, getting on a train for an hour, walking half a mile (my favorite part), working my ASS off for 8 hours straight in a place where human beings are cordoned off in little squares where all of them live on a spectrum of making the best of what they recognize as a meaningless existence and getting by, to those who are aware they have wasted their lives and are slowly dying while their life’s work goes through my exchange server then get’s backed up to oblivion while making no recognizable impact on the world. I would walk back to the train, sit for an hour and listen to podcasts and music (i liked the train actually) then get home and if I was lucky I would see my children for 30 minutes while we ate dinner then they were off to bath and bed after we did story time. I was missing their lives...\n\nI left and have never looked back. I would rather make half the money or less and spend 100x more time with my family and that’s what I do now and it’s just great. If I had stayed the stress would have killed me anyway. \n\nI just wasn’t cut out for that life. I knew what the rest of my life was going to look like and it was just...a robot life.

I'd learn something new every day, and that went on for many years. I was looking after IT back-end systems for 20+ companies and it was never boring. However, for the majority of my time there, I mostly had average or below-average managers. The type of managers that become managers because of their age, not because they can actually manage people properly. The first few weren't too bad. And there were a couple of short-term ones that were awesome; and are still my good friends now. But when they left, and were replaced.... ugh. That was the worst thing that happened to me.\n\nThe new managers were snappy, hateful, bullyish, rude, dismissive, etc. It ruined the company for me and I ended up hating the environment. Their behaviour stamped all over the enjoyment I got from my job. It sent me over the edge, over the course of a year, and damaged my mental health significantly. I got out and traveled for over a year. Something I had pre-planned for a while. But by that point I damn-well needed it. I found out sometime after I left that they treated other people this way too. I just didn't know at the time because the treatment was so degrading and embarrassing that we never really discussed it with each other.\n\nLooking back (and forward), I would work for those short-term awesome managers in a heartbeat, at any company.
