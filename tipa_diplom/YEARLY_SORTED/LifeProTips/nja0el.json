In the front row, you can't see everyone  looking at you and it feels like a much smaller group, or just you and the teacher.

That means when grading, the instructor will have notes on everybody, but will REMEMBER the first and last presentations.\n\n4) You have less time to prepare. The grader knows this, they are more lenient. It also showed you were prepared.\n\n5) Stress. You are done, the remaining time is your chance to just relax and enjoy the ride.\n\n6) Follower. Ever hear the phrase \"Hate to follow that\"? You don't have to worry about following a stellar performance.\n\n7) Copycat syndrome.

How it worked, pressures, temperatures, and so on. After you've spewed your verbal diarrhea, they'd grill you on it to either point out your fuck ups, to see if there was other things you knew (such as procedures to make the system do various things), and what to do in emergencies. Myself and a couple others were scheduled to do that over several days, I wanted to go first, but they drew names for order and I was placed dead last, which was probably for the best.\n\nI had a bunch of civilian qualifications from before I joined, resulting in me knowing how a bunch of things related to the system I got worked that never really comes up. How various things work, how to bypass them/juryrig them when you don't have the right parts to fix them, and so on. You know, things you learn when you work for a company whose priorities are profits and getting jt back in production with what you have on hand over taking the time to do it right. I still knew how to do it right, but I also knew what ways you could cut corners when it suddenly became time critical.\n\nAfter we were all done, myself and the people who had done it were relaxing when one of the POs came in, looked at me, then looked at all of them and said, \"You're all fucking lucky he went last, because if he had gone first none of you would have passed.\"\n\nSo my advice is your position in the order should depend on 2 things.\n\n1. How confident you are in yourself and what you know about the subject, those who know more should go later as the first person can establish the basics and each subsequent one can build on that, and\n\n2.
