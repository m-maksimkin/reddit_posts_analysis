    "LPT: Don't fall in love with a place you are vacationing at. You are seeing that area for a week or two, when you are not working and you are under less stress than you would be at home. I've seen too many people uproot their lives to move to \"paradise\" only to find out it's not what it seems.\nEdit: Wow, it's been a lively morning with lots of discussion surrounding this topic! Exactly what Reddit was originally meant to do.\n\nFor those of you who got hurt or offended by my LPT, I don't apologize. It is my perspective from a guy living in a tourist area and this is what I see.\n\nRemember, I might be a dick, or maybe I'm not a dick, who knows? And who cares, this is the internet.": [

The entire economy of Playa is geared toward tourists, naturally. \n\nWhen we lived down there, however, things are different. Basic internet is spotty (high ping, frequent outages, we had to pay to have the road dug up to get better service). \n\nThe cellular network slows to a crawl in peak tourist season (winter).\n\nGetting your driver's license renewed takes an entire day.\n\nThe local hospitals is good and cheap for straightforward issues (what I call \"tourist injuries\" like ear infections or twisted ankles), but when we lost a pregnancy at 21 weeks, I was literally running through the halls unable to find a doctor or nurse to help deliver the baby.\n\nOur local coffee shop owner was killed for not paying off the gangsters. The chief of police was gunned down a couple blocks away from our kids school (he had the temerity to arrest some street dealers).\n\nWhen our house was robbed of some of my wife's jewelry, our (Mexican) lawyer advised us not to involve the police, as they'd then know what else was inside our house.\n\nWhen a mechanic we'd hired to fix our old Durango SUV hadn't returned the car in weeks, we said we needed it back. He returned it with the entire engine in pieces in the rear. There's no Better Business Bureau or small claims court to take your case to. Junk the car and start over.\n\nOur kids' English teacher at the private school (sounds fancy, is not) they attended would ask us how to pronounce very basic English words.\n\nThe government ran billboard ads imploring citizens to pay their taxes, as non filing was that prevalent.\n\nWhen we first arrived, a phrase I often heard from people was, \"Money can buy you anything down here.\" Which, if it were meant to be reassuring, had the opposite effect on me. \n\nBottom line: the people are nice, the country is beautiful, but corruption is rampant and services we take for granted in developed nations are, well, lacking.\n\nI used to watch all those House Hunters International shows thinking the people on them had discovered a life hack. Now I know what you trade off by relocating to a vacationers paradise.\n\nTldr: lots of stuff you take for granted as a resident, isn't present in a vacation hotspot.",

Roads you need to get to work can become regularly closed due to logging, rockslides, avalanches, and just ordinary snowfall if it’s enough of it. Plows don’t usually go up the mountains. It’s picturesque and you get some nice summer weather, but it’s a difficult slog the rest of the year. My grandmother retired to a mountain home and almost used up all of her retirement savings just hiring people to come make it livable on a regular rotation, be it grocery delivery, snow removal, or just waiting hours for the police to come chase off a bear so she could go outside again.\n\nSimilarly, I spent two weeks living out of a time-share in Kailua-Kona on the big island. I’ve been in rural Canadian towns that had better access to amenities. You really do have to be prepared to live an almost penniless bohemian lifestyle, or be exquisitely rich; trying to live “middle class”, you’ll slowly starve yourself of the things you’re used to. There is very little freedom of choice when it comes to the stores you frequent, or the goods available; you sure aren’t just popping into the Apple Store to see the latest product, not unless you want to take an airplane to Honolulu.\n\nThey’re great destinations, and I’ve nothing ill to say about the people who do live there, but yeah, most everyday folks don’t appreciate that it can actually be quite difficult to eke out an existence in tourism destinations. It’s not just a super-extended vacation.",

The first thing I learned was I could absolutely not go walking around at all.  Except in the tourist areas.  Me being a white woman I would get instantly mugged or maybe even kidnapped.  Government is corrupt so literally the only safe places are the tourist areas and even those are iffy.  The less affluent Bahamians have house with no roofs because they can't afford to replace them after all the storms.  They have to collect water in cisterns even the more wealthy people.  If anything breaks at your house, which is usually the internet, it can take weeks to get fixed.  People's cars are banged up because no one gives a crap about hitting people since insurance there is also corrupt.  I didn't drive there but I was constantly scared because people literally didn't give any fucks about signs or lights.  Most cars had dents or worse.  Buying groceries is extremely expensive.  One gallon of milk was about 8 dollar or more.  American brands cost 2 to 5 times more than here.  And even non branded generics were expensive.  Oddly fastfood wasn't much more expensive than here.\n\nI would never want to live in the Bahamas.

It is my birthplace, but I'm taking the whole family to settle somewhere in Michigan. Everyone keeps warning me about the winter like that's what's going to be what scares me off. It's the shit that I haven't thought about that is scaring me. \n\nMy original plan, years ago, was to move to Alaska. Until I got into the thick of just how different that region of the world is. The sun hits you at a different angle and heats your ass up in a way that's alien. The horse fly swarms are a nightmare straight out of that Diablo 2 level. I was ready for the concept of a harsh winter, not swarms of predatory flies that start chewing immediately.\n\nMoving anywhere is a risky. There are always unforeseen consequences that you'll have to navigate. I moved to California in the early 2000 to work for the big tech companies. I couldn't survive in the housing market Ended up living poor in Stockton, and I was nextdoor to gang activity for a whole yearlong lease. I had to be extra cool around the neighbors even when they were assholes and I keep a temper. Gunshots outside the door nearly every night. Dog fighting in the backyard. I didn't expect that shit but I got stuck next to it for a year.\n\nI lived in the infamous Miami Gardens area and it was like my old neighborhood in Louisville, no big deal on most nights. Cops are a nightmare everywhere. Everyone's mileage will vary. I left the area because my work prospects dried up.\n\nNow I'm older and I got a little bit of experience under my belt. Been back home for a little over ten years. My land is worth something substantial suddenly and I'm getting offers I can't refuse because of legal threats. So I'm salty that Kentucky itself is going out of its way to screw me. So fuck it, I'm taking my riches and my businesses to another state. Michigan is affordable, and has legal weed. The beaches are nice and very swimmable in the summer, and I don't care if they are too cold for the other half the year. I'm not seeing a lot of downsides when I'm up there. But I since I ain't weathered a full winter my relatives think it's best we stay put in the river valley. Knowing my luck we'll settle next to a serial killer on a former toxic waste site.\n\nHave a plan to egress if necessary. Don't do anything if you can't survive economically.

You weren't aware of how much of your life would be dictated by the market.

You have to work--in fact, you'll sometimes even consider yourself *lucky* that you can work and pay your bills (mostly when you see those who can't). It's very easy to get numb to the fact that this is a life of constant, ever-present pressure. You are *always* under pressure; you are *always* impelled to obey the wishes of those with the wealth to control you. \n\nThen you go on vacation--for maybe just a few days you are *not* obligated to produce capital for your masters. You can drink, you can nap, you can look at beautiful scenery (which is normally wholly absent from your life)...and the pressure *fades.*\n\nAnd it feels *SO DAMN GOOD* that you want it to last forever.

During that year, I saw that Canada has much worse labour laws than Germany, less public holidays (easter was optional) and most work contracts are on call or on contract (ie you are not an employee directly employed to a company, but at an employment agency working for the company) and the contracts are only a few months long. In reality, a lot of young Canadians are suffering. The tuition is incroyable expensive. The COL is expensive. I saw a young Canadian in his 20s getting hospitalized due to the mental health issues he had. Considering this and that that the residency requirements are complicated AF (they prefer 20 y/os over 30 y/os). Don't get me wrong, Canadians. I love your country. I loved the time being in Montreal and Toronto. But I love to have a German work contract, with German hours and German holidays (up to 30 a year). Don't think that German problems will be gone if you move to Canada. You will face a different reality. Like getting a passable score at IELTS or getting your driving license converted (drivers from some select countries have to start anew with the graduated driving license system, depending on the province, laws are different)...  \n\n\nI am now some kind of cured of this. I still fancy Canada, but I might opt for an intercompany exchange if that is possible in future, given the situation improves, until that, I prefer to stay a tourist with a return ticket.

Food, drinks, clothes, electronics. And in-season everything is ridiculously expensive, like up to 10x the normal price. A bathing suit that's usually around 5€ will sell for 50€ and they will call it a sale. Good thing we have e-commerce. 2. One thing you can't buy off Amazon, sadly, are houses. I can sell my 2 bedroom house and my 400 sqm yard In the city and buy a small villa with 2 ha of land and a car on top just 100 km inland. 3. The city itself is mismanaged. Everything goes to the \"resort\" part of town. You have 5 stars hotels next to roads that have holes in them bigger than the craters on the Moon. You have weeds growing as big as me. Thrash containers and public benches that disappear overnight and never get replaced. Street and intersection lights that malfunction, and never get fixed. I know of an intersection that hasn't been fixed for 20 years. 4. Overcrowding. Not just people, although for a city of 300.000 people we received as much as 10.000 tourists a day. That's almost a million tourists per season. But also buildings. Every patch of free land. Every parking spot. Every rundown building gets demolished and a new 10 stories \"luxury\" apartment block rises. I don't know how these people can label their broom closet apartments as luxury. Some constructions are legal, but some are illegal and clandestine. But the authorities can't demolish them because doing so would mean endangering the neighboring buildings. And finally 5. Noise and pollution. Except the small strip of beach resort where you are not allowed with a vehicle (although I've seen cars ending up in the sea) the city is a permanent traffic lockdown. You can walk from the edge of the city to the center in about an hour. It'll take you a lot longer if you try to drive there. And the noise is virtually unbearable if you don't soundproof your house. Traffic. Loud music that you can hear from the other part of town day and night. Ambulance helicopters (because the roads are full). Small planes that tow commercial banners. That's \"paradise\" for me.",

And holy mutha, eyes wide open now that we're here, \"living the dream\" LOL.\n\nBottom line, it's a beautiful place, amazing culture, incredible recreation opportunities, patient  and kind local people and the cleanest air and water and best weather on the planet...hands down, all year long, just like you'd expect.\n\nThe down sides? Some are more obvious than others - median home price of $1.1 mill is a problem for locals and residents. Work?  Pay are a fraction of the mainland.  Opportunity - not much unless you're well-off financially and bringing a business.  Need a good hospital or doctor, soon?  Better fly back to the mainland.  How about a new toaster oven or .... anything regular ol' household item? Pray Costco has it, or be prepared to hit that Amazon button and wait...and wait. Need your car fixed?  Or your pet cared for? Expect to pay 150% of mainland costs....for possibly WAY lower levels of service than you're used to on a daily basis. Making friends? Unlikely, folks are too transient. Bad people, crime?  Yeah, if you're paying attention.  Then add in the tourism factor....yikes.  Shortages and crowds occur even in \"normal\" times when you're on little spots of land 2500 miles from the major continents.\n\nDO NOT FEEL SORRY for us, LOL. We created this - it was our \"dream\", remember?\n\nIs there a lot to love? ABSOLUTELY.  Are we bored already?  Yeah.  We're looking at it as an adventure, and we live in the present and love it because we can, right now.\n\nEDIT:  and while it may seem improbable in \"paradise\" - don't even get me started on the racism that simmers between the cultures here - and I'm not just talkin' Haole / Hawaiian - it's so much more complex than just that MAJOR, to-be-expected rift.

Then when they do sell, you have to move ASAP (did that TWICE). We made tons of friends; really good people live there. However, when it went bad, it went REALLY bad (like cops & judges threatening to throw us in jail for not paying bribes bad)  In exactly 3 weeks, we managed to find an Airbnb, pack our house & pets then move to Mexico (leaving Belize is expensive & a friggin burocratic fiasco). Now that we're here - living in a place we never heard of much less visited - we can't believe how shitty Belize was! Worse, that we put up with the every day shittiness for as long as we did.

The airline worker checking us in for our flight home had a conversation where we told her about how much she loved the city and she told us she really doesn't like living there. It's easy to love someplace when you're spending gobs of money on luxury accommodations, food, and non-stop all day entertainment and cultural experiences. You're not dong that when you live somewhere. I grew up having special day trips to New York City with my mom where we would just shop and eat and go to broadway. I loved those days, so when I graduated college I tried living in a city for myself, absolutely hated it. I hated not being able to get in my car and drive somewhere. I hated living on top of other people in an apartment. For me, visiting NYC for a day filled me up with energy. Actually living in a city drained me. I agree, visiting somewhere and living somewhere are not at all the same.",

We really hit it off and ended up spending a lot of the vacation together, she had been more times than me so she showed me around a lot of non touristy stuff that was still really fun. \n\nLong story short In the end we tried dating a little over long distance as she was a 3 hour drive but it didn’t work out, which of course doesn’t matter! Because now I have a life long friend that only lives a few hours away and she is literally always there for me even if it’s not in person.\n\nI got lucky by meeting someone in Germany who happened to live in my same state in the U.S but either way\n\n\n\nTLDR; don’t uproot your life to go chase love in some far away place but don’t listen to OP 100% and let yourself get swept off your feet, the WORST outcome if you do this all maturely is you’ll gain a good friend or a pen pal",

            "text": "Well, for this I have a strong sense of duty-unbeknownst to a lot of the inhabitants which I need to inform is this. In San Carlos, off Crestview drive there is a hiking trail. At the Crown of the hiking trail is a young sapling. The sapling overlooks the valley. Behind the sapling is a huge water facility. The stone which the builders rejected has end up being the most important stone. He was the stone that made people stumble- it is the rock that make people trip and fall. \nNot cut by chisel or altered by human hands- most suitable for Him to work with for it is perfect.\n\nThe setting of this stone makes all things unshakable. This, the setting of the stone is also the cornerstone.\n\nThe sapling (representative of sapient), is sickly due to the beliefs of the inhabitants in this region. Let’s hope it does not die- from Sickness or disease (indicating false worship).\n\nReference this to the Revelations at End Times to see the validity of the stream of water flowing freely from Christ. \n\nMasterOaks declared months back that this is Holy Ground. Authorizing Matthew, Mark, Luke and John- or Adam to enter and transform the scenery \n(on badge of MasterOaks)- wearing white only.\n\n\nAt the foot of the trail looking straight up is where His Rest has been established- the cornerstone which makes Heaven and Earth come together- thus making Unshakable a foundation. \n\nTwo may come to pay respects at the foot of.\n\nMore details will be available later.\n\nSpecial note: HOLY! HOLY! HOLY! Is the Lord God Almighty. For He is the God that was, And Is, And He is Here, Now. (And is Yet to Come)-\n\nThis I prayed during the trials and tribulations-\nAnd there, He rests. Hopefully this clears up a lot of propaganda, false claims of ownership and deceitful tactics employed by the antichrists and deceivers of this age.\n\nWhat else, if anything have they to do with the Works of Christ to secure Gods Kingdom?\n\nTherefore, with the realization of this proclamation, would anyone say this is a vacationing spot or is it home?\n\nThe original temple size built by human hands is nothing to be compared to the temple built by hands “NOT HUMAN”- which is me- Michael Luan Thien Dinh.\n\nEvery step I have taken is done with much thought and care to attention to all the details- \nPrior, this yielded a 1500 mile in every direction and the cornerstone is North.\n\nFurther steps yielded 12,000 stadia…but clarity must be established if this is only one of 4 squares…\n\nWhere the Lord comes with thousands and 10’s of thousands of HIs angels-\n\nNow it is Millions and 10’s of millions x 10’s of millions.\n\nSo while the false claimers and false spreaders of Faith ( Victorious)- do other things to deviate from the truth- I have been working on larger greater things fir the Faith and Trust in God, Christ and The Holy Spirit-\n\nYes, even calling upon The God who is To Come.

Yeah, a lot of things are gritty and frustrating and imperfect, but we’re all happy AF and can’t imagine going back. One of the best decisions we’ve ever made, and we have countless expat friends here who feel the same. The key, I think, is being a chill, flexible, open-minded person. You can’t be the kind that moves to vacationland and expects real life to never show up again. Real life will happen anywhere, so you might as well let it happen somewhere great.",
