    "LPT: If you need a suit and don't have much budget then $20 at Goodwill with $50 of alterations will look a hundred times better than a $70 suit.\nCheap suits are cheap because the store can sell them to the maximum number of people with the fewest variations. That means making them boxy, and adding baggy trousers. \n\nIf you can get a suit that fits in the shoulders (the one place it can't be cost effectively altered), then it can be made to fit you by shortening the sleeves, slimming the waist and adjusting the trousers. \n\nCelebrities look good in their suits not because the material used is especially good, but because the suit has been altered to fit them right.\n\nIf you take your Goodwill suit to an alterations tailor (your local dry cleaner will recommend one) then the bulk of your budget is being spent on making it right *for you* rather than on the initial acquisition.": [
