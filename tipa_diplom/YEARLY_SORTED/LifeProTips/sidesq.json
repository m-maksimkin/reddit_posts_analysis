And another thing: owners and managers are people too. I just laugh on the inside when my peers at the time would be in awe of owners or partners or managers and not realize they need you as much as you need them. And the truth is, unless you're considered a superstar within your company and get promoted quickly with raises, leaving is your best option. I'm not saying burn bridges as I've done that and it's not a good thing, but develop good working relationships while you're there and when the time comes to leave, just explain it in a positive manner. I didn't stay at any one job for more than two years until my current job because my boss is literally probably one of the best bosses on the planet. He doesn't just treat me well professionally, but personally as well. Heck we've actually even got into arguments because I thought he should pay me LESS and he said no.

I'm going to shut that right down when we actually sit down for it. I'm still being paid $18/hr and work like 60 a week. They said recently if my performance doesn't improve (I'm about 10-15 min late early in the morning kinda often, but we have a 10 min buffer and I live 30 miles away and usually stay an hour or two over) don't be surprised if at my next eval I don't get a promotion or the bioinformatics position.\n\nLike wtf. I should've already had it for months, since I've been doing all the work for it AND my old position at my original rate.\n\nI wanna hold on because it would be a great career pivot gaining data analyst skills with little education background in it, and it's not easy getting beginner positions in data science.

I asked for an increase in salary and a shift in responsibilities so that I don’t get bored and I only got promises (we’re not able to increase the salary but if you stick around for a year, until next April, you’ll get a very fat bonus check). I did my part of the deal and, when april came around I got a 6% salary increase (cost of living increased by 4% so it was actually 2%) and a 8% increase for my bonus. When I complained about broken promises they told me “we looked at what other IT managers are paid and you’re actually earning more than they do so we can’t justify a bigger increase”.\n\nLiterally two days after that I got an email back from the Amsterdam job offer that I declined on a year before: apparently it didn’t work out woth the person they hired instead and they wanted to know if I would still be interested: needless to say, two months later I was enjoying my first Dutch stroopwafels and bitterballen.\n\nWhen I left, the company hired two people to do my job: one for the IT part and one for the ERP system. The IT guy replaced a lot of my infrastructure and didn’t secure it well enough and, soon enough, they had a massive data breach. The ERP guy tried to get up to speed for two years; after two years, instead of asking for help, he recommended turning off the entire ERP system and implementing a shittier one but one that he had some idea about how to operate. Then Covid hit and it all went to shit, forcing both the CEO and CFO out as the stock price dropped 60% and would not recover.\n\nThe lesson I learned is that if they will promise you something and break that promise, you’re not the only one they’re doing it to; it’s better to jump ship before the shit eventually hits the fan.",

Product is in demand with built in monetization scheme. \n\nManagement team is S tier ex Google, Facebook, and Amazon with stellar credentials. Clearly they have the skills to successfully create the promised product. \n\nOnly problem is their projected break even date on the funds presently found from investors would be 5 years given a specific overhead maximum. That overhead limits labor costs for the services you would be hired for, stack manager,  to being extremely amateur level, 50k/ year,  where the same services rendered at a fortune 500 would yield upwards of 250k. \n\nYou have the opportunity to negotiate the missing 200k/ year,  or 1M in total, as a percentage of overhead ownership in the company. In other words, if that 5 years saw an overhead of 100M, your missing 1M would be 1% of the company. \n\nSo you took a gamble and worked for dirt (by your skills standards) for 5 years, and came away with 250k + 1% in a business that blows up to being a billion dollar behemoth.\n\nObviously these numbers are ridiculous and only for ease of seeing the numbers, not any sense of accuracy to the real world. \n\nTL;DR negotiate in a way that protects you and ensures you get what you deserve, then the risk of OP's caution becomes reasonable.",

            "text": "I worked Full time just a couple of months ago for a local employer. They paid me pretty well but I wanted to move up to assistant manager and I knew I was ready and had outgrew a regular full time spot. I was already third key.\n\nThey don’t have any many stores as a competitor but I’ve sat down with them and discussed that if a store opened up, I’d like to be considered for the position and knew I could handle it and they told me that I’d definitely be a first pick if a store finally opened.\n\nIt took a while but they opened a store after almost a year. Lots of movement happened where two assistant manager positions opened up. However, I had been evacuated and displaced after Hurricane Ida. When I came back after a few weeks when I found temporary housing, they had already placed people, two being people who came after me and I felt were not as qualified.\n\nSo I put in for a manager position at the competitor. They hired me pretty quickly. When I put in my two weeks, I told them I’d be making more money. They offered me a on the spot $2 an hour raise but promised that in 2 years I’d be making what the other company would at the point I’m being hired at now. (I was already going to be making 8k more and I get raises every 6 months at the new company for a total of 4K raise over 2 years. So 12k more at the end of two years and what they promised me was I’d only be making 8k more with THEM by the end of 2 years.)\n\nI was like “yea not gonna happen.” No way they’d remember that promise. Also, why would I initially make 8k less for two years with a promise I’d make that and lose out in the new positions pay that entire time?\n\nI left so quickly. I don’t hate them or anything. Nice people and I miss them a lot. But I had to watch out for myself.",

So he calls me and sheepishly apologizes for the way I've been treated and offers me an 8 dollar raise from 27 to 35 dollars per hour. \"Ok great\" I think. I'll take the pay raise and request that they treat me with respect. They agree and everything is going great,  no problems and i actually feel like im being treated well. I solve all of their customers issues in less than a month. Fast forward to now and my boss calls me to say the company is in a slow season so they will be reducing my pay to 28 dollars per hour. I refuse this and they argue with me and eventually drop my pay from 35 to 32 per hour with the promise that I can get a raise when the company gets more busy. I stayed but I'm thinking of quitting very soon. Almost the entire company has quit in the past year and weve been replacing them with kids fresh out of trade school.
