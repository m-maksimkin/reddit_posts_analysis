When we went to summer camp, parents would give their kids money, but the money was kept with the banker - so kids would pace themselves and not blow all their cash on candy day 1.  My dad also put an educational spin on this by not just remembering kids names/faces, but making them have a password in order to access their $. \n\nNow boy scouts is kinda weird because there is a wide age group, and I really thought some of the 16 year old guys were super cool, so I tried to hang with them a lot. Anyway, one day we are sitting around and they say, ‚Äúhey OldDogWater, wanna play the question game?‚Äù \n\nI of course say yes, and they proceed to ask me various questions, stuff like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your favorite color‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your mother‚Äôs maiden name‚Äù. Etc. I thought the game was boring but whatevs I‚Äôm just chillin.\n\nThe next day, I go find my dad, the banker, and ask to take out $20. Banker opens up the security box and says ‚Äúoh, you don‚Äôt actually have any funds? You withdrew all your funds yesterday!‚Äù \n\nEventually I piece together what happened. I probably told dad how dumb it was for me to need to answer his security questions when he knows who I am earlier on in the trip. He decides to setup this trick with the other guys. They got my info, took my cash, and my dad must have thought it was the funniest shit ever.

The better solution is to tell people to use fictional names or favorite obscure subjects most people won't think about.\n\n\"What's your grandmother's middle name?\" should be answered with anything but your actual grandmother's middle name. What's your favorite fast food item? French fries? Put that as the answer.\n\n\"What was the name of your first pet?\" This is a trigger one for me because too many names can be used here of actual pets, allowing people to easily guess it. Never use the name of any pet you've ever had. Use something stupid, like \"Liquid Aluminum\".\n\n\"What was the mascot of your high school?\" Another trigger question given so many high schools have the exact same mascot. Hell, just using any of the top 20 mascot names is guaranteed to grant entry. Instead, put your favorite teacher here.\n\n\"What was the first model car you owned?\" A bit more flexible, but again, simple information to gain online. My recommendation: use a license plate number. Already difficult to guess, but rarely spoken about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are but a few examples of how to address online security questions. If you have used real answers, your next step should be updating them, not moving to another subreddit.",
