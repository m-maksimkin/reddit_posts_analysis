Well it turns out they gossiped to someone on a different team who was concerned with this and reported the managers behavior to the higher ups.

He told our supervisor because when time cards came due she lectured me that sick time wasn't for things like that (its state ran mental health group homes, sick days for mental health happen all the time and are okay per policy) but would \"let it slide this time.\"\n\nAnother staff that was temporary reassigned to my new site to help out had been with the state longer and his cat was his baby. When we were chatting about this later after getting to know me straight up \"you are too honest of a person. When you call out sick you don't have to say anything other than that it is not covid symptoms to the supervisor. They can't ask anything else until it becomes an FMLA issue and you need doctors notes/ don't have any sick pto.\" as he took time off when his cat was sick as needed.\n\nI pass the same information along to coworkers now that I'm the lead staff. Even the ones that seem flakey and just didn't want to work that day for some reason or another when they call in I cut them off and tell them they don't need to tell me what \"they have\" and I don't care.

If I'm honest and say I'm watching over a sick, potentially dying pet, it would be nice if instead of condemnation there is some understanding and \"i'll just say it was a sick day for mental health if anybody asks.\" if that isn't a good enough reason to stay home.\n\nFYI anybody wondering, vets have no idea what happened to my cat, he was only 3.5 at the time and recovered in a day, didn't recommend expensive MRI and such to find the reason as it could potentially turn up nothing since he was fine now and has no outward symptoms of stroke, toxic ingestion or anything that they would normally find.
