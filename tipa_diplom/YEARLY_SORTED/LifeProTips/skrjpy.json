    "LPT: When a job interviewer asks, \"What's your biggest weakness?\", interpret the question in practical terms rather than in terms of personality faults.\n\"Sometimes I let people take advantage of me\", or \"I take criticism personally\" are bad answers. \"I'm too honest\" or \"I work too hard\", even if they believe you, make you sound like you'll be irritating to be around or you'll burn out.\n\nInstead, say something like, \"My biggest weakness with regards to this job is, I have no experience with \\[company's database platform\\]\" or \"I don't have much knowledge about \\[single specific aspect of job\\] yet, so it would take me some time to learn.\"\n\nThese are real weaknesses that are relevant to the job, but they're also fixable things that you'll correct soon after being hired. Personality flaws are not (and they're also none of the interviewer's business).": [

I agree that this question is lazy, but the truth is it’s often asked as part of the generic interview question gauntlet you may have to go through. As someone who has interviewed, and also interviews, here is some genuine advice:\n\n1) If it’s a job you’re genuinely interested in, take an evening to write/type out answers to the most generic interview questions. Just do a Google search for, “Top Ten Most Common Interview Questions”, and then prepare thoughtful answers to them. Worse case scenario, you’re never asked them and you wasted an hour of your time. However, best case scenario; you have a genuine and well prepared answer, which also serves as a huge confidence booster in an otherwise stressful situation (designed to put you on the defensive).\n\n2) Think of a “weakness” that could also generally be perceived as a strength. For example, during my last interview (when I was posed this very same question), I responded with, “I can be too trusting of people. I want to see the good and willingness to try hard in everyone I meet, until I’m proven otherwise”. While this could be a disadvantage in some situations (ex. Loss Prevention), it is advantageous when talking about developing people, because it shows you care and are generally fair and positive with direct reports.\n\nJust my feedback, take it for what it’s worth, but I wish everyone well in their interviewing endeavors!",

It was terrible timing, too, because I was trying to run this story idea (this was in 1999), about Hermann Munster's stunt double on the set of The Adams Family, but it wasn't going so well.\n\nWhen I explained to my potential employer that one of my biggest weaknesses during hot weather was excessive sweating, she didn't really understand where I was coming from out of context. It was a summery, California winter, and they didn't understand what I was trying to get at: I said that I kind of sweat waterfalls, and that pressure exacerbates this glandular tendency I have. It also makes me quite literally weak at the knees, which means I'm prone to fainting a lot.\n\nSo we're going through the other stock-standard questions, yes, I have a driver's license, no, I'm not able to come in on Monday's because I need Monday's for yoga classes, and when I'm trying to articulate the impracticality of sweating over a printer press in above 90 temperatures, it doesn't correlate how I take criticism personally dripping everywhere. It's a kind of personal thing that bleeds out into the impracticality of practical terms, because if I'm sweating too much, I could smudge the ink, least of all smell very badly.\n\nShe recommended this thing to me, called deodorant, which kind of worked, but that job at the printing press was short-lived.",

I told them very frankly in the interviews “these are my strengths, and my weaknesses are that I’m not as familiar with development finance as I’d like to be and these areas specifically are what I hope to learn from this company if I were offered the job.” And then I listed a few out. I think they really liked my experience, my honesty and thought I would be moldable. \n\nThey offered me the job in Q3 of last year and I accepted it and glad that I did. I didn’t try to make it philosophical. It was pretty much just like what OP said. I applied it directly to the role itself and was frank about my shortcomings and gaps. I think they appreciated it.",

Someone who has a known problem and ignores it is a red flag for recruiters.\n\nBe ready to answer questions about the specific skillset to show where your current abilities are.  A good tactic is to give a skill you are actually competent in but are still mastering, or a certification you are taking classes to get.  Learning a 2nd language, especially if the business operates primarily in your non-native language, is also a fine answer.  Working on your English and say it's a weakness? Well here we are having an interview and I can see how much progress you have made.\n\nAlso, in the current era of employment, jobs do not want to train.  Training is expensive, hard to do right, and makes employees more likely to leave.  Why? Because if you reallocate training budgets to payroll, you can headhunt already experienced workers, pay them more, and be just as profitable as your competitors, but they just lost their best employees so you have the edge.  Now no one wants to train, they just want you to already be good or willing and able to self-educate.",

Employers sometimes intentionally make interviewees uncomfortable or put them in an awkward position to see how they wiggle out of it or handle the situation. \n\nTherefore, situations like these must require offense as opposed to defense to diffuse awkwardness. \n\nNever interpret weakness as “Weakness” per se, but instead think of them as something you’re proactively learning. \n\nStart with something like: \n\n“No individual is perfect.”  Or “Just like any individual, I’m not perfect either” \n\nBoom! First, diffuse the awkwardness because it’s an indisputable fact that no individual is perfect. No interviewer can argue with you here. \n\nThen start strong with your strengths so that your strengths are highlighted and reinforced in their minds. Then demonstrate your humility that you are active learner and are constantly working on improving yourself. It must come across authentically though, if you try too hard, they’ll know you’re experiencing awkwardness. \n\nLike: \n\n“I’ve led a team of 15 people for a campaign that required coordination, proactive communication, and project management. The important lessons I drew from that event along with feedback from stakeholders were responses to change or adaptability, organizational , prioritization, preparedness, and communication. For e.g. in the campaign, we realized more resources were needed at the moment than we were prepared for. So, we signaled our backend team to bring more resources. Due to that, customers had to wait for a little longer before they could use the resources we were going to offer.“ \n\nYou started strong with your strengths, then slowly cascaded into demonstrating your humility about being an individual who learns from self & others. \n\nNow once you do that, tell them specifically, how you’re improving yourself with conscious and concrete steps. \n\nLike: \n\n“From this, It was glaringly visible to me what areas of improvements I needed to focus on. I started working on organizational skills by starting small like organizing & managing files properly. Then I started focusing on organizing the processes cross-departmentally. This also helped me to improve on my prioritization and preparedness skills. As for communication skills, it’s one of those skills where one never gets done learning regardless of one’s position in an organization. As opposed to having a reactive approach, I started communicating proactively. For e.g. I try to listen more when others are expressing; when sending a written info to non-technical clients, I try to express with limited technical words and when I’m using technical words, I try to ensure that they get accompanied by proper explanations & contexts to avoid miscommunication.” \n\nThis gives a clear picture to the interviewer that you don’t just say “You’re working on it” but rather you’re demonstrating how you’re working on it.

The advice given here by op, is just commonplace trash advice, for ordinary people, that might not get the job. \n\nWhat you need to do is think about what your actual weaknesses are, and meditate on that in advance.
