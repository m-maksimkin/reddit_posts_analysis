    "LPT: When a dealership tells you the vehicle is on the lot or will hold the vehicle for you and then tells you it was sold when you get there, leave. They pulled a bait and switch on you.\nThis is a very common tactic to bring customers to the lot. Half of the work in selling a car is to get the buyer to come to the dealership. I have found that most of the dealerships that pull this tactic are not ones to be trusted; they showed you that they are willing to trick you so you can come to them, they have a mindset of tricking their customers for profit. If they don't have your vehicle then leave and continue your car search, dealerships like these are more trouble than they are worth.": [

Knew what my current car was worth.  Knew what they would sell the truck for.  \n\nI walked in to my local dealership, sat down with the salesperson and said:  “I’ll give you that car(pointed to my car)and I have a check in my wallet for $X, and I get this truck.(handed him the printout).  I do not want to finance.  I do not want to hear you have to talk to your sales manager.  I do not want to go back and forth all day.  Please feel free to have your service guys check out my vehicle.  All of the service has been done here at tour dealership.  I just want a yes or a no.”  \n\nI’d done all the math.  This was a good deal for the dealership who would make above their bottom line on the new truck, and make probably about $3,000 reselling my car.  He had his service guys check out my car.  Then he comes back and what does he say?  “Your car checks out and we agree on the trade value.  I ran the numbers and we need you to finance about $4,200 through us.”\n\nI stopped him right there.  “Nope.  We’re done here.  I told you politely and plain as day that I’m not going to finance.  Goodbye,”. To which he replied: “Well let me go talk to my sales manager.”  I laughed, stood up, and walked out.  \n\nThe next day on my lunch break I went to a dealership close to my office.  Said the same exact thing.  The salesman had service check out my car, accepted my deal, thanked me for being straight-forward, and I drove back to work in my brand new truck in about 45 minutes.\n\nOn my way home that day, I stopped back in to my local dealership.  I parked right in front.  I went to the sales manager.  I told him:  “Yesterday I was in here and sat with “John Smith.  I offered him blah blah blah and told him I would not finance, I would not haggle, and would no go back and forth with you about getting the deal approved.  John tried to finance me and tried the whole “Talk to you” thing.  I left.  Today I went to Xdealership and offered them the same deal, and that’s my brand new $61,000 truck parked right there.  Maybe you should have a talk with John and maybe going forward you guys could actually listen to your customers when they say they have no patience for games.  Have a nice day.”",

Truth be told, some dealers are scummy enough to pull the good ol’ bait switch on their customers and if you do come across these dealers, then you shouldn’t be doing business with them regardless. However, it’s very idiotic to think that dealers will hold a vehicle and miss out on the potential opportunity to sell such vehicle to someone else on the slight chance that you actually do come in to the dealer. Most sales managers will tell you that they cannot hold the vehicle for you if you’re not leaving a deposit on it because they cannot stop another customer from buying that particular car if they decide to do so. Deposits are the only way to really “put it to the side” just for you and no one else. Also, just  because you think you’re the only person looking at that vehicle doesn’t always mean that the dealer isn’t already working a deal on it with someone else. In fact, salespeople are allowed to work deals even if you’re test driving the car because nothing is final until you commit to buy and sign. If anything, you being there looking at the car gives the salesperson more leverage to convince their customer to come buy the vehicle or they’re going to miss out.",

They're paying interest on those cars. If a customer puts money down to hold the car, the dealership will hold the car because money is involved. \n\nThat being said, this isn't a good feeling to have a car held for you and then sold out from under you, but if you're serious about a car, put hold money on it.

Rescheduling or not being able to show up for days is possibly going to screw you. Also, its communication, not so much a trap. Some sales ppl straight up ignore a hold on a car and sell it out from under another sales rep, and it is pretty embarrassing for everyone. Sales is not an easy career. Treat ppl with respect and they will typically do the same. I love my sales ppl. I am not saying there has never been a crappy situation, things do happen, but to bash and act like its purposeful is merely ppl just not having a clue what its like to sell cars. There are scammers out there, and to believe other dealerships will have the same cars is really stupid given that inventory is terrible because of covid the last 2 years. I know where i work, we go out of our way for our customers. A lot of them make their own mistakes and take it out on employees or ppl who answer phones. Be kind, get kindness in return.

They will be a nightmare to negotiate with.\n\nYou don't need to negotiate a final price online but at least make sure you are in the ballpark.  When they say presence is power, it is true to a point.  If you spend time there, test drive etc and are willing to walk they may (may being the operative word) offer a bigger discount.  Online they won't give the best price usually, becasue they have no skin in the game.  \n\n\nWe would get dozens of leads a day and 2 or 3 would ultimately show up.  We won't waste time negotiating for days on someone who likely won't show up.  That we would give a good price to get you in.  We didn't play games, other dealers did. \n\nSide note.  If you buy in Virginia or any state that requires an inspection sticker when the car arrives on the lot, walk the lot with the sales person and pick out a car with an inspection sticker older than 3 or 4 months old. Dealerships don't own their new cars, they finance them and don't pay interest for the first 60-120 days depending on their floorplan.  So if you pick out a car 6 months on the lot you may get a better deal because that car is costing them money as opposed to the car that arrived last week.\n\nOne more tip.  Addendum stickers (the extra sticker next to the window sticker) is usually bullshit.  Don't pay for any of it unless it actually adds to the car.  And most of the time it doesn't or you can do it cheaper (tint, pinstripes etc)  The only exception is usually pickup trucks where grill guards or bed covers and what not may be added.",

With everything being online these days, there really is no reason to go walk around different lots to see what they have, just look on their websites. If you go in with the intention of negotiating in-person, these bozos will waste your entire day.\n\nHere is my advice if you're buying a new car:\n\n- Create a spreadsheet with all of a relevant dealerships within 100 miles of you that have, or can get, the vehicle you want.\n\n- Create a throwaway email account that you will only use for this purchase.\n\n- Look on the website for each dealership, note the stock numbers of the vehicles you're interested in, email each dealership asking for a price quote. In your spreadsheet, put a hyperlink to the car(s) you emailed about for reference.\n\n- When the quotes start coming in, mark down the prices for each car in your spreadsheet. Now, take the lowest 3-4 quotes and pit them against each other. Send email replies to the  dealerships that had the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th lowest quotes and tell them the 1st lowest quote amount, asking if they can beat it. \n\n- When you get the lower quotes back, do the exact same thing with the new quotes. Some dealerships may ask for proof of the lower quotes, go ahead and send screenshots or email forwards to show you're not BS'ing them.\n\n- Around this time, the dealerships will all try to get you to physically come in. Tell them you aren't interested in physically looking at anything until you get a price you're comfortable with. If they refuse to give you a quote without you physically being there, forget them. \n\n- Keep all of the quote amounts in your spreadsheet so you don't have to rely off of memory. \n\n- At some point, they will all get to a price where they can't go any lower, this is likely your best price. If you feel good about the price at a specific dealership, schedule a time to go into the dealership to meet with the person who gave you the quote to actually look at the car.",

They say I need to wait for an hour until the car is back. \n\nI wait. They never call me back. I call them a couple hours later and, lo and behold, the \"couple\" decided not to buy the car and it is available. I come in and my 'shit list' of stuff wrong with the car just got 3x longer.

Know what the car is worth before you go (the are required to make the VIN available to you--one call to your bank and you can find out from them what they think it's worth--better than KBB!). Tell them you DON'T want financing (you can almost always get better rates at your own bank and they know who you are and will work with you if you have money issues). Note down EVERY SINGLE ISSUE with the vehicle. I go through and extrmely extensive list every time I look at cars. Tire tread. Interior lights. Sensors. Wheel alignment. Seats moving as expected. Check EVERYTHING. Once you drive off of that lot, that car is YOURS along with any issues.

The dealership had it for ~11k on a 5-year term. So you bet your sweet ass I jumped on that quickly. Unfortunately  I forgot I had froze my credit accounts because I got my wallet stolen (which stupid me kept my SSN card in my wallet, this happened a few years ago and I just never thawed it out).\n\nSo since I showed up around closing time for the dealership, they asked if I could take care of that and come back the next day. Sure, no problem. The salesmen said and I quote this \"We will keep the car off the lot and remove it off of our website and mark it as sold.\" Cool beans right? Well, I got my credit thawed out, went to their website just to see if they infact did take it off the site. Low and behold, they had the same truck (verified by the VIN #/CarFaxs) but at a lower price of 9k. I was miffed, so I called them and asked if they still had the car, salesmen said \"Yep, for 11k still, off the lot in our back lot\" \n\nme: \"Really? that's funny, because I am on your website and I see the same vehicle that I am interested in, with the same Vin # and car facts but at a significantly lower price. Can you help me understand this please?\" \n\nSM: What was the vehicle your interested in and the one your seeing on the site?\n\nme: White Toyota Tacoma 09. says on the website 9k.\n\nTo make a long story shorter, I called them out on their bluff, and said \"If I don't get the truck for the listed price on the website which is 9k, I will take my business elsewhere. the ball is in your hands. I have the down payment right now cash in hands. So I went in and bought my 2009 Toyota Tacoma with 52k miles on it for ~10.5 out the door.

Said there was someone was interested in it but would be willing to sell right now if we were willing to buy it pretty quick.\n\nI knew they were pulling crap but as my ex was completely naive about the world, I figured this would be a perfect example to educate her on how not to be scammed by high pressure sales tactics should she ever need to do something on her own. \n\nI said, sure, let's test drive it. And, to be honest, aside from being slightly sluggish and the front end feeling \"off\", it really wasn't a bad car considering what we were looking for. She was kind of interested in it because it worked well with her disability so while we were test driving, I told her exactly what the dealer was doing this moment (doing a quick check on us to see how much car they could sell us, if we could afford, yadda yadda) and what the dealer would do step-by-step when we got back and what each of the major steps meant and why it was bad. \n\nWe hadn't even turned the car off and the dealer started. Within 30 seconds, he nailed two of the things I told her he would do. She just kind of looked at me. I could see the gears starting to turn but she was still pretty interested in it.\n\nSo I said \"Let's go inside and talk, see what there is to see of what you're offering.\" Nothing committed (of course to a sleazy dealer, that's a done sale). \n\nSat down in the office and high pressure started. \"Oh, you wanna take it home overnight to test it out and check it over?\" (So they could give our car a thorough inspection, maybe touch things they shouldn't). Yadda yadda yadda, right down the list in order of what I had told her.\n\nI forget exactly what it was that he said at this point but she had had enough and just got up and walked out while he was in the middle of a sentence and considering her personality, that was her equivalent of punching someone. The dealer didn't see it but I could see pure disgust on her face. I grinned at the dealer and said \"She says 'no.' Have a great day.\" \n\nAfter that, she trimmed down that list to the \"These are the requirements\" with no \"would be nice\" things on it and completely trusted me to make the decision without further input from her. She wanted nothing to do with car dealers after that. That wasn't a small thing for her.\n\nWe're not together any more but I really hope she's still carrying that knowledge around and applying it.",

I get there and not only is it not on the lot anymore (not a bait and switch, probably just sold and the ad not taken down yet) but the salesman I spoke with didn't even know what it was at all. I explained to him it's a small hot hatch and that's generally what I'm looking for, but I'd be open to looking at other stuff. \n\nHe tried to set me up in a Malibu for 4k more than what I wanted to spend, spent the whole time trying to convince me how this boat of a car was right for me, and how a slow 4 cyl turbo is still cool because, hey, it has a turbo. I test drove the thing, told him it was slow and boring, not to mention it was ugly and had this tacky faux wood dash. The car was nearly out of gas, probably since they had so many people test driving it and not buying it, I had to drive the guy to the gas station and wait for him to pump gas. \n\nHe legitimately tried to convince me that I would be settling down with a family soon and that I should be safe. I'm like 28 at the time, single, and I wasn't looking for a sports car, I was just looking for a little hot hatch. He wanted to sell a car so badly, I swear he nearly convinced himself it was an amazing car. He tried to guilt me, \"you said you were open minded,\" to which I basically explained that open minded doesn't mean being convinced to buy something that has no similarities to what I wanted at all. He was annoyed and I felt like the whole experience was a waste of time. \n\nWhy couldn't he just try to sell me something I wanted instead of trying to convince me that I *actually* wanted something different?

So that's what I did. Towards the end of the 2 weeks still no car. I called everyday and there was always some delay. One major thing I emphasized, besides me telling them why I had only 2 weeks, was since I was shopping for a new car it better not have more than 10 miles on it. They finally tell me the city the car is in and what's taking so long. They were waiting on a sale for a car this dealership had so they could send someone to drive the 3 hours here in the car I bought and send the driver back in the other car for the sale. I told them I wasn't buying that car anymore. They kept stressing how they feel played because I got a super low interest rate and thought I just used them to get a better deal on a car.\n\nI didnt do that. But that is how it ended up.

She got home with the vehicle she HATES and wasn’t entirely sure how it happened.\n\nWhen I was young, I did something similar (with the exception that it was the car I wanted and the price was right… but it was just luck that it ended up that way) because I didn’t realize I was seriously ill when I went in and I got sicker as I was there (104 fever sick - long time ago) and then they told me that they accidentally wrecked the car that I had driven in but they would still give me full trade… I was delirious and asked them to let me go home and they had me sign the papers and sent me home in my new car (again, husband was more focused on making me happy than on controlling the situation- common issue at dealerships apparently).

            "text": "I worked at a dealership for a few months way back in the day and it was the only job that I have ever walked out.  That's not to discredit the very few honest dealerships put there (I have one in my area that earned my business for life). But, to go along with some of the other comments on here, one thing most dealerships push their sales team to do is just get the customer in the door. There's a neat video on YouTube (I am having trouble finding it) but, it goes over the percentage increases of someone buying a car from arriving on the lot to sitting in the office. Basically, every step the customer takes closer to going inside, the percentage increases drastically that they will buy a car. So, for me, as soon as I call a dealership and they tell me they have the exact vehicle I am looking for and to schedule a time to come in, I immediately mark them off the list. There could be an exception out there somewhere but, 99.9999% of the time, no dealership will ever have the exact vehicle you are looking for. Which, to the next point, and to add to the original lpt, never go into a dealership without your research. Know exactly what you want, what options you are willing to sacrifice and which are must haves and do not compromise. Know fair market trade for your car (use auction sites not kbb).  I usually check several auction sites for similar vehicles and then set my trade price about 2500 to 5000 less.  And, most importantly, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, buy a new car if you are upside down on your current loan.  Finally, have your prices written in stone. I refuse to negotiate car prices. \n\nSo, for me, my car buying process is:\n1. Do a very broad inventory search from multiple dealerships to find the exact vehicle or at least as close to what I want as possible\n2.  Call the dealership and let them know your interest in said vehicle.  Make it clear from the start, that you are not coming in until all numbers are agreed to. \n3.  Give them exact numbers of what you want for your trade and what you want discounted off their vehicle\n4.  Have pre-approval outside financing ready to go\n5.  Make sure you have multiple pictures you can send of your trade vehicle as well as a thorough list of information as to why your vehicle is worth what you are asking\n6.  If they get you in the door and anything changes from what was agreed to on the phone, walk immediately.\n7.  When you go to finance, have a laptop with an excel spreadsheet for car financing and plug in their numbers to make sure everything lines up.  Immediately call out any discrepancies to find out what they are trying to add in.\n8.  Turn down gap insurance (you won't need it if you're not upside down) and extended warranties (they are from 3rd parties and in very few circumstances will it ever come through for you)\n9.  If at any point the above conditions are not met, walk away.\n\nBasically, make sure you are in control of the process from start to finish. Too many people give up their negotiating position because they get wrapped up in the excitement of a new car. \n\nFinal advice: never put yourself in a position where you HAVE to buy the car. \n\nI have a ton more I can say on this but,I've written a novel already so,anyone that sees this, is more than welcome to message me if you want any advice or help on car buying.",

Essentially they make their money by moving as much inventory as possible, so usually pricing will be fair. A good indicator that you're going to have a lower hassle experience is to check the dealer website for 1) public access to a detailed inventory listing, and an 2) online sales manager. You might be able to get away with straight up asking for their sales model.\n\n With my latest car, I contacted an online sales manager via email about the exact vehicle in their inventory listed online I wanted, and asked for bottom line pricing with Tax, Title, and Licence (TTL). It was the best pricing within 50 miles, so I showed up the next day, and was in and out in about 3 hours.\n\nFor this same reason, I highly discourage signing up online with no-haggle list services. They are a load of bull because they don't screen the dealers. So you'll get shady dealerships that sign up on those lists, and you'll get paired with dealers using antiquated salesmanship trying to get you to come in first. One had the audacity to tell me my request for bottom line pricing was not \"how the industry works\" and that I needed to go in to see their inventory, after I reminded him this was a no-haggle service contact.\n\nSo TLDR, detailed inventory + bottom line pricing from an online sales manager, and walk away if they pull anything remotely shady.",

            "text": "I work in the automotive industry on the software solutions side of the business (i.e. I don't work for car dealerships but for a company that supplies them software) and this LPT struck a nerve with me.  TL;DR data in the auto industry is trash and it is absolutely not always true that a bait and switch is afoot.  \n\nLong version:  Here's how the software cycle for a car dealership works in relation to inventory:\n\nDealership procures a car via the OEMs (Ford, GM, Honda etc), auctions, wholesalers, or from private parties.  The data about this inventory (year, make, model, trim level, VIN, options etc) is added to their inventory database solution where a stock number is applied. They use that database as their \"source of truth\" and primarily run their business from that.  That file will include cars they aren't currently selling but that they do actually own.  Think loaners, rentals, shuttles to and from service appointments and the like.  The data about the cars they ARE going to sell goes into a different database system with it's own separate files called a DMS.  The DMS is their source of truth for sellable vehicles and the source of truth for the cars they've sold as far back as 5 years (more in some places.)\n\nIn the DMS they'll add additional data.  MSRP, Discounts, Website price, Sale price, Lease options, custom features, aftermarket additions, links to photos and videos, current status (sold vs pending sale vs in transit to or from a sister store vs available) etc.  When they sell a car the DMS still keeps a record of it, marked sold, while the car completely disappears from the Inventory solution.  The DMS feeds data into the dealer's online presence aka their website, Autotrader, Truecar, CarGurus, etc.  Each of those websites has their OWN database of vehicles, separate from the DMS and the Inventory source of truth.\n\nThe DMS also feeds data into the separate systems dealerships use to keep track of their customers, that tool is called a CRM.  They use the CRM to store all the information about all of their customers and there are usually separate CRMs for the car sales and car service parts of the business.  The CRM is the software solution the salespeople actually use.  When they clock in for the day they log into the CRM where they see a series of tasks of all the things they are supposed to do.  Call customer 1 because they requested information online, text message customer 2 because they responded to a marketing email that they received on their birthday, get ready for customer 3 to come to the showroom because they booked an appointment with your receptionist, email customer 4 because they found you on Autotrader and hit the \"Ask a question\" button etc.  Every one of those tasks has a customer, an opportunity ID, and a piece of inventory attached to it so they know what car each customer is interested in.  When they hand you off to the finance person they mark that car \"sold pending\" in the CRM, which dumps that status to the DMS (usually not in real time) but doesn't update anything else since you haven't actually driven off the lot with the car yet.  Once you are done with the finance person they update the finance system (another completely separate system) which changes the status to \"sold\".  That flag flows into the CRM where it updates the DMS which FINALLY tells the websites that the car should be taken down.  Once you actually drive off the lot the manager marks the vehicle \"sold delivered\" which updates the DMS which then tells the website and the Inventory solution that the car is no longer in their possession.\n\nFor those of you keeping track at home that means that the salesperson's workflow system is 3 data dumps removed from the source of truth, the website is 2 data dumps removed, and the system where they store their sales history is 1 data dump removed.  All that is to say that the CRM, website, and DMS might all show that a car is available when Jim Bob sold it yesterday and didn't enter into the appropriate system that he sold it.  As far as the salesperson who contacts you knows, it IS available.  Now should that salesperson actually go walk around the lot and make sure it's there?  Absolutely, but these folks handle literally THOUSANDS of tasks per day, and that's not counting the people who walk in off the street with no appointment.  So it doesn't necessarily mean that you are being duped when someone tells you the car is available on the phone only for it to not be there when you get to the lot.  They are probably just as irritated as you are that somebody else fucked up their opportunity to sell a car.",

The point is to just get you in. \n\nThen you have other “instant win” mailers. Same thing.

I can’t remember why else they were there other than that.  Basically, there was a chance you could win but it was astronomically small. As a consolation, you’d get a scratch off where technically every card was a winner. The catch was that actually winning was near impossible. It was a 6x5 grid and each box had a symbol. You had to get 5 of the winning symbols but couldn’t get a single other one. So you had to find all 5 on the grid and only those 5. \n\nThe second company was a group of traveling salesman that they brought in to sell with us for a month and they were largely complete pieces of shit, more so than your average car salesmen. They also did a “hey, you won” promo but it was bullshit.  Those events bring in a lot of old people that think they won something. I happened to speak with the first one who just wanted to know if they won or not. I brought the mailer to the office they took over and asked who was checking them.

            "text": "I was a car salesman for 4 years, and while I will not deny that there are several unethical tactics used to \"trap\" people into buying a car, and that you definitely should be ready and willing to walk out at any time, I have several times ran into the situation the OP describes for totally legitimate reasons. **The better advice to give here is to never bother with attempting to hold a vehicle or place any deposit in the first place.**  \n\n  \n\nMy dealership didn't officially take deposits or holds.  It's first come, first served.  This is true of many dealerships.  They may accept a \"hold\" but it's really just a way to get you to commit to showing up, and then they will apply your \"deposit\" towards your down payment.  **Though they are probably honest about the car you want being available, if a serious buyer walks in and wants to buy the car you \"held,\" they will take the guaranteed deal in front of them over the chance of you coming in later and not buying it, regardless of it you've given any kind of deposit.** This is the main takeaway.  If you gave them $500 to \"hold\" a car, they will gladly return it to you if you don't buy the car or if they sell it before you get there, but they're hoping that you've already invested the time to come in and will try to flip that $500 towards your down payment on a different car.  They may also, as my dealership did, offer to find you the same model from a different dealership and \"trade\" it or special order in from factory for you.  You get the car you wanted, but it may take longer.  Of course you're always free to just find the vehicle somewhere else.  \n\n  \n\nI have, on several occasions, had customers call in for a car, I confirm it's availability, and by the time they get there it was sold or in the process of being sold, especially on busy event weekends.  I have \"flipped\" many of these customers to other vehicles on the lot, but I've also had many leave and find the car elsewhere.  I was always compassionate, apologetic, and understanding in this situation.  **It's never a good sales tactic to do something so obviously shady and manipulative.  Maybe in the 90s, but with all the information available today, these \"gotcha\" tactics have mostly faded from regular use at any \"reputable\" dealership.  Your reputation (including online) and first impression are everything in that business and most of the salespeople I worked with wouldn't try to pull an obvious bait and switch like this.  The tactics are much more subtle now.**",

Dunno if this would work, but here's how it'd go:\n\n1. Pick out your car online from the dealership at the price you want\n2. Pick out a cheaper model car $5k - $7k less than the car you want at that same dealership.\n3. Go to the dealership and say you want the car from step 2 for it's price.\n4. Scummy salesman pulls a bait-and-switch on you.. hopefully referring you to the better car you wanted in the first place.\n5. If he goes to the car you want, pull out your acting skills and pretend to be in a \"maybe\" vibe.\n6. Salesman offers you the better car at the MSRP price. Don't be afraid to negotiate a little, because you just made the salesman think they're earning $5k-$7k more already, so why not lower it just a bit?\n7. Boom. Get the car you want, hopefully at a lower price. Win literally for you financially and psychologically. Scummy salesman hopefully is in a good mood. Go home happy.",

Things I required: bucket seats, power locks & windows, cd player/ radio with either an aux jack or tape deck so I could listen to my iPod instead of the radio, low miles, and flexfuel. The first dealer I went to that evening had everything I wanted, minus the flex fuel in an '07. (I had seen a few other dealers the week prior.) It was at a really good price, and I liked everything about it. Bonus: it had no sunroof. (This is a detail for later.) I told them I wanted to look elsewhere before I commit, but I will let them know what I decide. They thanked me for coming in, and wished me luck. They did gently remind me they can't guarantee it'll be there later. I said I understand, and went to the dealer literally three doors down the road.\n\nI told them what I wanted, same thing I told the previous dealer. So, he takes me out to the lot. Takes me directly to a 2006 impala. This was a no go for me from the start. I hated the trim. He opens it up, turns it on, and in the center console is a GPS nav/radio, all touch screen. Neat at the time, but no CD player, no tape deck, and no aux jack. He pointed out the sunroof.  I said I didn't care about that. This car was also priced the same as the '07. I said, \"There are only three things in this car that I asked for, power locks/windows, bucket seats, and it's an impala. Everything on my list is a deal breaker. I don't want this GPS. I want something I can play my iPod on. I don't want a sunroof. This is Michigan. I'm screwed if it gets stuck open or a seal breaks.\" So he goes to talk to his manager. His manager asks me to talk to him in his office. I bite. Manager asks what I saw at the previous dealership. I tell him. I also mention the lack of sunroof. And he says to me, \"No sunroof? That's a bastard car. Look. It sounds like you want bells and whistles. I can get a stock radio put back in that car and it's yours.\" And proceeded to try to sell me on that exact car I did not want. I said, \"Absolutely not. You aren't listening to me. You're trying to push a car I have refused several times. Bye.\" And I left.\n\nI went right back to the dealer 3 doors up the road, rather livid, and found the salesman, and I asked, \"is it still here?\" And I bought the car. After signing the contract, I called the dealership that pissed me off. I said, \"I want you to know your neighbor owes you a favor. Because of you, I bought that bastard car with all the bells and whistles like a stock radio and bucket seats, and no sunroof.

We go to the dealership tell the salesman we where here about the deal on a lease, tell him straight up we could do 150, but that's it. Test drive yada yadda, and we go inside to hash out the deal. \n\nThey came with paper work that said 212 a month. We asked what about the deal, he's days the car has xyz on it and that costs extra, I tell him I don't need that crap and regardless we told you we could do 150. He runs back to manager, come back with 187. I repeat that we can afford 150. He goes to the manager again, and this time the manager comes back with him. And the manger starts going on about xyz is on the car, I cut him off and again say I don't care. They go back to his office and return with 162. At that point I look at my dad and say I think we're done here and we should leave. \n\nAs we walk out the salesman is all butthurt and asks why we're walking away. We tell him if you guys couldn't do the 150 at the start, or started at the 162 maybe we'd be signing papers, but getting jerked around for an hour and a half made me feel like I didn't want to give them any mommy no matter how good the deal.

I said cool I really didn’t like silver anyway but do you have the same model in Black. Checks his inventory on the computer and yes he does. I’ll take it. They get the car and I paid for it in cash. Fuck the finance charges. That salesman actually wasn’t lying and it all worked out in the end.",

            "text": "This is likely to become more commonplace with the ongoing production delays. It just happened to me a few weeks ago when I was searching for a regular Toyota Tacoma. The most local dealer literally emailed me on a Saturday morning with a notice that ‘trucks had just arrived’, and that they had just instituted a prepaid two-year lease. This meant I could lease a truck with one payment that worked perfectly for my needs. This email arrived in my inbox at 7:00am. My wife and I showed up at 9:05 (they opened at 9:00), and there were six identical trucks, exactly what I needed. We walk right in, ready to write that check. We’re immediately told that all six trucks had ‘already been sold’ and they had no idea what I was talking about. I showed them the email and they said, “sorry, these are sold and we aren’t expecting any more of this model until November and the lease deal is only valid for trucks in stock. But I could absolutely buy a higher trim level that was en route from the port, but there was no lease deal and the truck was $10k more. We turned, walked out, got in our car (we have 2; this was a recreational purchase) and were driving out of the lot when the ‘sales manager’ (oddly not the same ‘sales manager’ who claimed all of the trucks were sold, ran out and flagged us down. As coincidence would have it, one of the trucks they claimed weren’t available ‘had the deal fall through’.\n\nWe smiled, nodded, had them write everything up while we went for breakfast. \n\nThen we walked back in, told them ‘thanks, but no thanks’\n\nWent to anothet dealer across town, in and out in two hours.\n\n(Edited for a typo)",

They sent me an offer to sell a new 2021 sport vehicle with lots of add ons for a specific price, which the ad said was more than 15% off MSRP.  I called up, asked the salesperson to verify the car was still available and that they would sell it for that price (not includes sales tax and licensing).  After twice checking, he confirmed.  I told him that I was going to pay cash, not finance, and had no trade in.  We agreed that I would arrive 2 hours later (I live 45 minutes away) to pay for and pick up the car.\n\nWhen I got there, they took me for a test drive, which I hadn't asked for, then had me fill out all the paperwork necessary to purchase and get the vehicle licensed.  \n\nThen, things changed.  I was told to follow the salesperson to another room, where I was sat down at a desk next to another purchaser.  The manager then came and announced they were going to sell my car to another person--the person sitting at the next desk--because he was \"first\"!  \n\nIn fact, that person, a younger asian guy who was financing, hadn't actually signed anything yet.  So we sat there and watched as his salesperson told him that there was somebody else in the shop ready to buy the car (me) unless he signed the lease without further negotiation right then and there.  He signed.  \n\nAs I got up to leave, I asked our original salesperson how much more he paid for the car.  She admitted he paid about $1500 more.  So, the sales manager just out and out lied.\n\nBut, the joke may be on them.  I am an attorney.  I do breach of contract litigation.  I sent my lawsuit out for service on them just the other day.

At first, I thought this place was cool, albeit unprofessional. The atmosphere felt more like a party house, rather than a business and young me thought this was pretty awesome.\n\nAfter I found a car I liked and test drove it, I went back into the office, and was sat in the dealership owner's office to go over the paperwork. They told me they absolutely had to run my credit score in order to print out the paperwork. I felt like that was wrong, but didn't mind too much as I was really interested in the car. \n\nI had mentioned that I didn't intend to make a purchase that day, and that I only intended to find a car I liked, and get a paper copy of the contract so I could take my time at home to look over the details. The contract was printed out, and I said thank you to the owner and the salesman for taking their time to do this process with me, and that I was ready to leave so I could review the contract.\n\nAs I stood up, the owner said, \"Where are you going? You need to sign the contract so I know you're serious about the car.\" I sat back down in confusion. I repeated that I wasn't signing any paperwork today and that as long as I liked the deal, I'd be back on the upcoming Friday. The owner didn't like that, and started telling me I was wasting his time and wouldn't come back. The salesman who showed me the car had been standing behind me while I was talking with the owner, and when he saw I was going to leave, he left the room to go grab the largest staff member that was there. This guy was obviously only there to intimidate people who weren't sure if they wanted to make a purchase from this dealership. The big guy came in and stood behind me and asked \"What's the problem?\" while trying to appear as menacing as he could.\n\nI told the owner I was leaving, and I didn't like how pushy he was being and then stood up. The big guy tried to block my path without touching me, while they both insulted me. My buddy walked in, because he needed to go and was expecting the trip to be done by now. We promptly left, and I told him about the BS intimidation tactics they were trying to use on me. I didn't bother taking the contract with me. \n\nI was expecting them to try to forge my signature, but nothing ever popped up on my credit report and it's been four years since then. \n\nIf you get a bad vibe from any business, just stop whatever you're doing and walk out.",

I’ll refund it and text you a picture of the receipt. “ The sales person then sneakishly charged my card $1,000 AGAIN and quickly cancelled the charge then sent me a printed receipt of the refund which was a cancellation.

Before I get this thing out on the street, the engine temp begins to creep up. We pull out into traffic and the gauge buries itself in the red. I told the dealer we're turning around before the thing melts down. We get back and he puts me in this 96 1/2 or 97 Expedition. I played with the 4x4 knob for a minute while he got the keys. As soon as I threw it in reverse, this terrible grinding sound came from underneath. I shut the truck off and walked away. An hour later I purchased a 1998 Expedition XLT 4x4. I gave it away last year and it's still running.\nNot long later I went looking for a project truck, though. One, a 1996 Ranger, stood out. I asked for keys, popped the hood and discovered the radiator was dry. I looked up to see a salesman headed out with another key. I told him to hold on a second while I take a quick look at belts, hoses, etc.\nNot only does that moron start the engine with my arm in there, he revs it to red line several times over. I must jumped about ten feet and then thundered at him, \"SHUT IT OFF before you burn the engine up!!\"\nHis response? \"See? Great truck. POWERFUL truck.\"\nI actually wasted a little time trying to cut a deal with his manager. Asking price was $2,500. I offered him $700 and explained why.\n\"Are you CRAZY!?\" he said. \"I'd drive that thing from here to Dallas right now.\"\n\"You do that. I'll even call you a tow truck.\" I chucked him the keys and left.\nLast was this 1998 Explorer I found on Craigslist. It was definitely a project truck. That thing was absolutely falling apart, just what I wanted really. It was New Year's 2016. I called the dealer and shockingly, someone answered. We chatted and the mechanic put down his plate of black eyed peas to go get it ready for a test drive. I got there and he explained quite a few things were broke but it would go from A to B. I verified this...rather quickly after stepping on it a couple of times.\nWe closed the sale and drove both vehicles tandem to my house. I drive the mechanic back in the tin can, Madza crap infused little SUV that could. I looked around inside when I stopped for gas and found this key that fit absolutely nothing on the truck. Doors, ignition, nothing, but it was a Ford key. I called the dealer hoping they were still open and they were. Dude had been looking all over for that key. As I found out later, the seat was at such a weird angle it would empty your pockets faster than the repairs would. That mechanic said to me he was glad he'd eaten his black eyed peas in New Year's 'cause me finding that key and bringing it back was a stroke of luck. It went to an 06 F-150. He offered me that vehicle for $2,500 but I declined.\nThat Explorer lasted me three years and finally breathed its last at just over 205,000 miles.",

            "text": "When in the financing office and they start handing you the mile long packet of papers to sign, make sure you’re paying attention to the fees where the final dollar amount is at. There are a lot of fees that the dealer will try and pass off onto you, and more often than not, the buyer just signs without hesitation or reading them. When I learned about these I looked at the paperwork when my husband bought his new truck in 2016; and I was befuddled. It was an extra $6,500.00 in fees just like on the following list. We got hosed, never again will I fall for that.\n\n                    Fees You should never pay for:\n\n- Freight Fee : the cost the car dealership pays to ship the car you bought from the plant where it was manufactured to the dealership where it is sold.\n\n- Dealer Preparation Fee : This charge is so that the dealership can prepare the car for you to drive off the lot.\n\n- Admin Fee : Some dealers also call this a “processing fee” or “documentation fee,” but it is all the same thing—it’s the cost to cover processing the paperwork on the sale of the car you bought. \n\n- VIN Etching : Vehicle Identification Number (V.I.N.) etched into the window of their vehicle as this discourages thieves from stealing the car. Police departments also support this process. However, V.I.N. etching is not mandatory and should never be done at a car dealership. \n\n- Advertising : Car sales are driven largely by price and incentives, and communicating to people about their prices and incentives through advertising is part of the car sales business. It is the responsibility of the dealership not their customers. \n\n- Window Tinting and Other Upgrades \n- Fabric Protection : new cars these days already come with fabric protection built into them. And, if you need additional protection for the seats in your vehicle, you can buy Scotchgard at your local Wal-Mart for about $10 and spray it on yourself in less than five minutes. Yet many salesman will sneak a $200 charge for fabric protection onto a bill of sale and, if you notice it, will tell you they add it to all the cars they sell. This is a bunch of crap and is completely unnecessary.\n\n- Extended Warranties : Most retail outlets will find a reason not to honor an extended warranty should you ever need to use it, and B) Most regular warranties are sufficient and likely all you’re going to get anyhow. Yet extended warranties are particularly popular among second hand, pre-owned or used cars. Dealerships and salesman love to try and sell people extended warranties on everything from the car’s engine to the transmission, radio and tires. Don’t be fooled. Extended warranties cost a lot of money with no guarantee of providing any real protection should something go wrong with a vehicle. New cars can also come with extended warranties on items such as the radio, a DVD player, etc. But, here too, these are a cost that is best not incurred.\n\n- A.D.M. : A.D.M. stands for “Additional Dealer Markup.” Sometimes, this is expressed as “A.D.P.” which is “Additional Dealer Price.” This is a confusing acronym meant to trick the buyer and enable the dealership to charge more than the advertised sticker price on the car in their showroom or on their lot. Basically it means the dealership can jack up the price of the car as they see fit and charge customers more than the advertised price for the vehicle they want.\n\n- Rebates : Once a vehicle is purchased, the buyer finds that they have to jump through a mindboggling series of hoops to get the promised rebate, or discover that there is some loophole or trick preventing them from actually getting the rebate. And while rebates are not a fee charged to customers per se, salesman use them as leverage when haggling with customers—saying they can’t go any lower on the price, but not to worry because you’ll get thousands of dollars back on the rebate. Truth is that rebates come from the vehicle manufacturer and usually apply regardless of the price that a person negotiates with the car dealership.",

He would come to class and brag about how he screwed customers over on every sale. One was a widow that wanted to trade her late husband's Cadillac for a smaller car and it was worth more than the car she wanted, he convinced her that her car was worth next to nothing and left her owing almost 10k on a car that wasn't worth that much. I asked him after school what I could get on a trade-in for my car and he assured me that 10k would be a minimum so I went in the following weekend and he said that because I was his friend he could pull some strings and get me $2,500 only if I made the deal that day. I told him that I didn't come in to get a new car, only to see what kind of a deal he would offer a friend. He replied that when anybody walked through the door they ceased to be a friend or relative and became a customer open for the pickings. That attitude seems to be the norm for every car salesman I have dealt with since then.",
