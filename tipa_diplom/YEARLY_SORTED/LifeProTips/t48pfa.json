My observation is that >40 year old users tend to expect synchronous communication, while younger users do not. Older users also tend to treat SMS as synchronous, while younger users do not.\n\nI think it dates back to how >40 year olds grew up with the internet. If we set the epoch at email (ignoring things like BBS), our interaction with communication over the internet started as an asynchronous means of communication. Sending & receiving email meant initiating a dial-up connection that took several seconds and tied up a phone line.\n\nChat showed up pretty quickly. First chat rooms. There was IRC, of course, but IRC usage was pretty limited due to the technical complexity. Most ISPs had their own user-friendly \"walled garden\" versions; e.g., Prodigy, AOL, etc. The real chat explosion occurred when ICQ was usurped by AOL Instant Messenger (a.k.a., AIM).\n\nChat rooms, and then AIM, taught early internet users that chat was synchronous. If you wanted asynchronous communication, you used email instead, because early chat systems didn't work for asynchronous communication. You couldn't even message someone who was \"offline\" when AIM came out.\n\nYounger users seem to have skipped email entirely in their personal lives. Sure, they had to use it for school, but texting killed email for personal communication. This meant that this group of users used texting for both synchronous and asynchronous communication.\n\nMost importantly though, I think that AIM taught an entire generation of people that chat is for synchronous communication.",

What would be noticed and commented upon if a person was hanging out in another's cubicle for an hour is dismissed for the logic it must be work related-it's happening in Slack! Since my workload isn't impacted by other's behavior it's no big deal but in prior work environments where work could trickle down and leave me picking up the slack, I could see this system as just being hugely problematic. Does everyone in the company really need to know Sheila needs a new battery for her mouse?! Nope. But for some reason we all Do! \n\nMy company wanted me to add Slack to my cell phone and I refused. When I'm not being paid, I am under no obligation to talk to anyone there! I love what I do and the people I work with, but there definitely should exist a boundary between home and work life even if we are home based. I think the people who do have it on their phones shot themselves in the foot. They are always \"on.\" I got reprimanded for sending notice once my project was complete as soon as I completed it.
