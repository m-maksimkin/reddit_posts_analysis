    "LPT: Each person's brain has a set number of hours of sleep that is required for proper functioning. Don't listen to your parents, co workers or boss telling you that a human only needs 4-6 hours of sleep. Less sleep over long period can lead to poor memory, mental health issues and even Alzheimer's\nFor example, I require 7 hours of sleep. On days where I sleep less. I'm annoyed, my memory and concentration ability is affected. I feel mentally sick through the day. Once I went a few days like this and then one day I had a good sleep. I realised how important sleep was. Your brain functions so much better. Everything is more clear.\nJust pay attention to how you perform on less sleep to understand this.\n\nThere are many studies showing association of poor sleep with dementia and Alzheimer's.\n\nThere are studies that showing association of poor sleep with high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nEdit 1: Many had asked about source for my claims\n\nhttps://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/sleep-deprivation-increases-alzheimers-protein\n\n\nhttps://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lack-sleep-middle-age-may-increase-dementia-risk\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/11/16/935475284/scientists-discover-a-link-between-lack-of-deep-sleep-and-alzheimers-disease\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6286721/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651462/#:~:text=More%20specifically%2C%20when%20one%20sleeps,help%20maintain%20its%20normal%20functioning.\n\n\"Until recently, the latest research developments have concluded that sleeping has much more impact in the brain than previously thought. More specifically, when one sleeps, the brain resets itself, removes toxic waste byproducts which may have accumulated throughout the day [2]. This new scientific evidence is important because it demonstrates that sleeping can clear “cobwebs” in the brain and help maintain its normal functioning. More importantly speaking, this paper illustrates the different principles of sleep; starting from the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) to the behavioral as well as mental patterns with chronic sleep loss as well as the importance of sleeping acting as a garbage disposal in the body.\"\n\nEdit 2: Yes I agree. Not just Quantity of sleep but Quality of sleep matters as well\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5449130/\n\nEdit 3: Amount of sleep required varies from individual to individual\n\nhttp://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/science/variations/individual-variation-genetics\n\nEdit 4: For people saying nobody says that. \nMy mom did. I followed the 6 hour thing for very long till I realised, that wasn't true and I needed 7 hours. I used to wake up at 4.30 AM to push more hours of studies ( after 6 hour sleep) man let me tell you. I was extremely sleepy and tired in class. I stopped doing that later. Couldn't keep doing that.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, they never let me sleep over 8AM, even during summer holidays.\n\nAbout Boss and Coworkers....In 5 months I'll become a doctor. Healthcare, depending on your speciality and job is one sector where sleep and mental health is actually ignored. I see my interns/ house surgeons staying awake   36 hours. Sometimes the job requires it. Night duties are a part of the job. Even during our undergraduate it's considered very normal to lose sleep over studying for tests and exams. Most of them sleep hardly 3 -  5 hours before  University exams. It has kinda become the norm. And yes I've heard my own friends bragging about how less they slept the previous day. It's pathetic.\n\nIn our student life these kinda extreme situations happen before exams and our exams go over a month.\n\nWhen we don't have exams, I keep my sleep the highest priority more than my studies and try to eat well and exercise. I'll take the stress when I have to, just before the exams.\n\nDuring internship, half the interns I see are sleep deprived and stressed.\n\nBrings me to another point. It's not possible to have a good sound sleep all the time, but we can have good sleep atleast most of the time.": [

It's just how it had always been. I made myself a million alarms, reminders, and lists so I could remember everything I needed to\n\nThen I got a smart watch and it started keeping track of my sleep. I started noticing a pattern. Anytime I had less than two hours of deep sleep, is when I would have the bad days. I read on reddit about cbd and gave it a try. After a week or so, I finally knew what it felt like to be a functional adult. I was getting three to four hours of deep sleep a night. I was no longer dragging ass after nine hours of sleep. I wasn't falling asleep standing up at 3pm. It was glorious.\n\nAnd then I got covid and then all that went bye bye\n\n*but* because of covid, I was homeschooling my daughter and noticed attention issues and after some research, discovered my daughter most likely has adhd and surprise, surprise, me too. I've just unknowingly trained myself to manage the symptoms. So, because of my discovery about the deep sleep issue, I'm hoping when my daughter gets older, I can have them check her out and make sure she doesn't also have the deep sleep issue.\n\nIt was kind of heartbreaking, ngl to have found the answer to my problems in cbd, only to have it ripped away. It's been 8 months since I had covid and I could quit taking the rx I use and took cbd and got massively into sleep debt. I was so tired one day that I remember taking a diamond ring off, but not where I put it and it's been two weeks and I still haven't found it. And somehow I lived like that for over thirty years. The rx is ok, but the cbd just made me feel so much better in general and the rx has side effects that I didn't have with the cbd.\n\nAnyways, if you have adhd, definitely get your sleep quality checked out.

The key takeaway is to listen to your body, and to try and push for schedules where regular sleep is allowed and encouraged. \n\nRemember, from a brain health perspective, you can't sleep too much, but the hours you don't sleep you can never get back. Sleep deprivation aggregates and builds up, and if you are chronically sleep deprived, you cannot make up the hours you've missed, and the damage you do to your brain may be permanent. \n\nNext time you're at the zoo, look at what the mammals are doing. When you watch nature documentaries, check out what mammals are doing. For most of the day, mammals rest. Yes, they hunt, scavenge, and build shelters, but for a good chunk of the day they nap and conserve energy. The human lifestyle of going 100% the whole time you are awake is not typical for mammals, and I do not think it's healthy. The days I get 10 hours of sleep, exercise, work, and take naps, I feel incredible. Those days are few and far between. Our 40 hour work week is not natural. It is what corporations are legally allowed to make you work for a full-time salary. Remember that child labor laws are there because corporations would make children work if they could. \n\nNormalize letting sleep be a part of a healthy and productive day. If you are sick, injured, or stressed out, you likely need much more than 8 hours of sleep. You likely need a nap or time being lazy and bored.",

Being one of these company-hired temps, they can force us to work however many hours/days they want. So for 2 years I worked a 3 hour shift in between 2nd and 3rd - the company thought this was a good idea because it kept turning out prodcuts constantly and they could force us to work 7 days a week because it was only 3 hours. \n\nHere's the kicker: supervisors could also force us to work an entire 10 hour shift after our \"gap\" shift. It really sucked for people with kids or people who lived further away to be suddenly surprised with \"hey you're also working 7pm to 5:30am\" - especially with people who didn't sleep for it. Why would they? They weren't expecting to be forced over.\n\nSo what happend? The head supervisor decided that the people with the most hours wouldn't be forced over the next week - basically they gave us the option to work over instead of forcing us. This created some of us (me included) to work 70+ hours during the  week in order to have our weekend free (except for that pesky 3 hour shift every day).\n\nI also was one of those people who lived far away. So on a typical weekday, I made the 45 minute drive to work, worked my allotted 3 hr shift, then the 10 hour voluntary shift, and then drove 45 minutes home. On a good day I got 5-6 hours of sleep. For 2 years. It was killer on my mind, body, and spirit. \n\nFinally a new contract was voted in that took us to a manageable 8 hr shift and the \"gap\" shift was taken away.

My friends and partner all watched as I just broke, my profs had been noticing my work getting worse for a while but they didn’t care I had an unreal class load. I prob got straight B’s(no +- system at my school you got whatever full letter even if you had like an 89) but I remember none of the content, it’s just a memory hole.\n\nEnded up inpatient in psychiatric care after all was said and done.
