I'm not a fan of guns for this very reason. I could care less if others want to have a cache of guns. That's their decision, but for god sakes at least handle them properly.

That IS the correct answer, it’s also not at all a definition of a safety in any sense.\n\nA better LPT is to know a bullet can exist in the chamber even if the magazine is removed. If you learn only one thing about guns in your whole life, if you only teach your kids ONE THING about guns it should be that. That LPT would save exponentially more lives than pulling, racking, visual checking and physical checking your unloaded stick every time you blink because magic mag fairy’s may have loaded your fun magmagically.\n\nETA: an unloaded stick applies to you and only you when the firearm is in your control only. Handing off a weapon or receiving a weapon is new custody and you should always double check. My daughter asked exactly this after learning to always check it, if I checked it and hand it to her isn’t it safe? Nope, everybody else are idiots, if YOU didn’t check the weapon in your hand/control, it’s unchecked.",

The Cousin had a gun specialty made and was really excited to show us, so we gather in the living room to take a look. While we were discussing that, he showed us a new pistol he had gotten as well, I believe it was a Glock. He took out the clip, popped the chamber, and we all passed it around to admire it while discussing his new rifle. (Mind you the 4 of us in the room are familiar with Firearms and know the rules about handling weapons). We all take a gander and give the gun back to the Cousin. \n\nAs we give him back his pistol, he tells us his method for clearing an empty firearm. He pops the chamber, points the gun at the ground, and pulls the trigger, a redundancy so that just in case there's a bullet in there, it would just discharge into the ground. Well, mid-explanation he shows us, and BOOM he fuckin' shoots the gun right into the ground next to the Coffee table. I've never heard a gunshot IN A HOUSE with NO ear protection but holy shit, we had been here maybe 20 minutes and then this happens.\n\nSo the 4 of us had all handled what we assumed was an empty weapon. Luckily no one was hurt, and we laugh about it now. The moral of the story is to please check your firearms properly, and for instances JUST like this, you need to assume any gun you handle has a round in it so you don't do anything stupid like shoot a gun in your own living room while you have guests over.",

This is one of the 4 commandments of gun safety, growing up every time dad showed us the guns he slowly walked us through the rules.if we ever broke one of the rules, even by accident, the guns were taken away, put away, and we got a talk about what we did wrong and why it was wrong, and why even though it was an accident, it was still bad. My son has toy guns, and we're already teaching him the same rules. He's young, so we are teaching him very basic, dulled back versions to start and then we have a foundation to build on as he grows.\n\nThe Four Basic Rules of Gun Safety:\n\n1) always treat the gun like it's loaded. When handed a firearm, remove the magazine if there is one and rack it to make sure its empty.\n2) keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to fire.\n3) never aim at anything you aren't willing to destroy.\n4) know your surroundings. If you shoot, know where that bullet is going to go. Think about all the possibilities, and pay attention. If you don't know what's beyond your target, you probably don't want to shoot.",

He brought it out and was waving it around so I asked to see it. Naturally as a soldier we're taught to clear every weapon when it's handed to you- I pulled the charging handle to the rear and locked it in place to find a round jammed in the chamber. The bolt and everything else was covered in carbon- the guy explained he'd gone shooting the weekend before and hadn't cleaned it. We took the rifle to his room and used a cleaning rod to push out the round. Needless to say he had been waving a loaded rifle at everyone in the room before and could have shot someone if I hadn't identified the jam by clearing the rifle when he handed it to me. ALWAYS check to make sure the weapon is clear and if you haven't, you NEED to assume it's loaded. You'll thank yourself for this every time.",

I slapped the mag back in and left it for about an hour before I found the little tool needed to release the slide from the body. Went back to work trying to break it down and I didn’t pull the mag. I ended up chambering a round, and pulled the trigger with my left pinky finger point blank on the end of the barrel.

He hands it over after checking to make sure its unloaded and I fire a few fake rounds into my cabinet and fridge and whatever else I could pretend to shoot but never pointing it directly at either friend. My one buddy is finishing up my sound system and they are about to leave so I go to the restroom and come back out and pick up the shotgun 1 last time and point it at my dresser and BAM! I fire a single spreadshot through my dresser and a good chunk of my work clothes. I'm white as a ghost, nearly deaf from the blast from it being inside, and my buddy hooking up the sound system finally turns around and says I was expecting to look behind me and see 1 of you dead.

            "text": "I seriously messed up as a teenager because I shot my brother in the head by ignoring this advice. Thankfully it was only an air rifle and I still have a brother. \n\nHe allowed me to ‘surgically’ remove the pellet from his head so we didn’t have to go to hospital and he was left with a scar about half and inch above his eye (that’s how close I came to costing him the sight in that eye, a potential tragedy in itself). \n\nI normally followed good practice with my rifle, leaving it uncocked and unloaded, the ammo stored away from the gun. I was the guy who told everyone not to point the gun at anything they didn’t intend to shoot, to keep their finger off the trigger and not to play with it. I took my teenage air rifle ownership very seriously, was normally very responsible, and showed maturity beyond my youthful years - with the exception of this one idiotic lapse. \n\nUnfortunately I failed to heed any of my own advice this particular evening. I very stupidly - and in one sweeping motion - grabbed the rifle off the wall, pointed it at my brother and pulled the trigger. It must’ve been one of my friends, but I still have no idea to this day who cocked/loaded the gun and put it back on the wall.\n\nIn the final instant of pulling it, I realised the trigger required more force than it would have if uncocked. I flinched and pulled the barrel up fractionally, just as my brother recoiled in terror that he was about to be shot. These two split-second actions probably spared my brother his eye. Instead of an empty ‘click’ there was the audible ‘pop’ of the air leaving the gun, and the sickening ‘crack’ of a pellet striking something hard. \n\nThen followed an awful silence. The moment between me pulling the trigger and him yelling out in pain on the deck (a few seconds max.) was the absolute longest time of my life. I genuinely thought I might have just killed my own brother (it was very close range). It was a horrible feeling, but lucky for me he’s got a thick skull (lol) and the pellet struck at a slight angle. It ended up about an inch away from the entry wound, lodged under the flesh of his forehead. \n\nWith my friend kneeling on my brother’s shoulders to pin him down - and my brother in agony - I managed to encourage the pellet to go back the way it came, just enough to grab it with tweezers (steel tweezers cut through lead pellets BTW) and eventually pulled it out. \n\nWe then decided in our infinite teenage wisdom that aftershave was the best available thing that would clean the wound. If anyone remembers the scene in Home Alone where Kevin uses his dad’s aftershave - imagine the camera cutting to outside the house and the loudest scream you’ve ever heard reverberating through the neighbourhood. Birds scattering, cats fleeing in terror and the pained scream of a 12yo who’s just had dad’s old ‘Hi Karate’ aftershave poured into a hole in his head, echoing through the town. \n\nYeah, it’s funny 20 years later. It was f_____g terrifying back then.\n\nKudos to my brother for letting me operate. He spared us having to explain this to a hospital, or to social services, or to my dad (who still doesn’t know to this day). Call it mother’s intuition or whatever, but as soon as she returned home she worked out what had happened, despite all of our lies and concocted stories. She saw the plaster on his head and called it correctly after about five seconds. \n\nThe gun was disposed of shortly thereafter and I learned some lessons that I thought I already knew:\n\n1. Don’t leave guns in their ready state.\n\n2. Don’t handle someone else’s gun without their knowledge.\n\n3. Never - ever - point a gun at anyone. Not even momentarily, not in jest - never. For any reason (unless you intend to shoot them).\n\n4. Take guns seriously *at all times*. That ‘one time’ could be fatal or seriously injurious to someone.\n\n\nTL;DR - shot my bro due to poor gun handling, he was OK, don’t be stupid with guns of any kind.",

Never look down the barrel of a gun, loaded or not.\n\n4. Always hand someone a gun unloaded, safety on, and by the handle unless there are special circumstances such as when hunting an animal. Even then be careful.\n\n5. Never put your finger inside the trigger guard or on the trigger unless you intend to shoot. \n\n6. Always be aware of what’s behind your target. Whether it be a literal target, an animal etc. Contrary to what call of duty has taught us bullets at speeds that can kill travel much farther then you think they do. So don’t riddle the neighbors siding with bullets or buckshot because they didn’t magically drop to the ground after 50 ft.\n\nThat’s all I can think of from all my hunter safety classes and things my dad taught me.
