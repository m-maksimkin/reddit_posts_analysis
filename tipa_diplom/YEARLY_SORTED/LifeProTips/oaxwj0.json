You can say you don't have enough money, or you are trying to make a savings account of saying no is to hard.\n\n- most importantly, it's YOUR money, YOU own it so you should never feel bad about turning someone down.",

It's just good form and it seriously takes a village when you're working paycheck to paycheck and can't get out (seemingly, tho I do hope that will change soon!)\n\nIf you have received a gift to help and they don't want it back, try forwarding the kindness later on to someone else when you can too. \n\nWhen a man asks for help, ya help em!",

He’d just bought a $19000 BMW, and said he had $34000 in the bank, but then told me he had to wait for a buddy to pay him back before he could pay me. It’s now been years.\n\nLast year, he started calling me and bugging to borrow money. Just wouldn’t stop. He’d blow up my phone.\n\nI said no.\n\nThen, on Easter weekend he called again and asked. Said they had no food, and his new job wasn’t going to pay him for a week or two. His cat needed food and that got me to send $60 to his girlfriend. But he said it didn’t go through, and bugged until I sent $60 to him.\n\nHe did end up paying back the full $120.\n\nThen, at the end of April he asked to borrow $100. I begrudgingly sent it. Then he asked for another hundred. I sent it. Then I got a call from him, saying he’d been arrested for domestic assault and needed cab fare back to camp where he’d live without his girlfriend. Said it was all a misunderstanding. I couldn’t leave him stranded, so I sent him $100 more. He told me he’d pay me back by the end of May.\n\nThen I got a call several days later, where he pleaded with me to lend him $500. I said no. Then $400. No. Then lower and lower. I said no.\n\nIt’s been crickets since. He hasn’t responded to my messages or my requests for the money. Nor has his girlfriend.\n\nI asked him, point blank, when we were on the phone: “Are you doing coke again?” His response was no, and he promised. I never knew him to have an addiction, but he said he’d done it a bit out there years ago.\n\nOne of the first times he called me, he told me that he’d totalled his car here and got a DUI. And that he and his girlfriend both got DUIs for driving the wrong way on an Alberta highway. He said a cop followed them for 100km then pulled them over. Charged him with DUI, her with it because she wouldn’t take a breathalyzer and charged them with drug possession. They apparently had baking soda for the cat in the car. He later told me it was thrown out because they tested it.\n\nAccording to him, he made 100K last year or in 2019, and had lots left in the bank until lawyers took it all.",

He sent me a message out of the blue and asked straight up if I could loan him $20. When asked why he said he had mismanaged his money and was short, but got paid on a Tuesday and it was like Sunday. Since I had no reason to believe he was a shitty person, and he had good work ethic when I worked with him, I had no reason to not believe he had mismanaged his money. He’s in like early 20s, I know it happens sometimes. I’ve been there. So I asked for his cash app and sent $25 because he said he and his roommate needed food to eat. Anything would help. So I didn’t have much money at the time and I’ve been struggling, but I thought about all the above and decided he needed it more. So I sent it, with a promise from him he’d pay me back Tuesday. I believed him. I sent a message to him about a week later asking if all was okay and he informed me he had been trying to pay me back but couldn’t find anyone to switch cash for cash app funds (I’m assuming he doesn’t have a banking account tied to it) to pay me back. I knew right then and there I wasn’t getting my $25 back. But I hoped still. \n\nIt’s been over two months now. Not a word from him or anything. Not nothing. At first I was hurt, how could someone just lie and use people? Then I was angry, considered cussing him out. Then I realized that I should do neither, and cut my losses. I think what bothers me more is the promise he’d pay me back. He told the truth, said he just fucked up and spent too much....or maybe it was a way to win sympathy? Idk. Either way I’m trying to work on being a better me, so I decided to cut my losses and not bring it up to him ever. I still have him on my friends list on FB. I may be a lot more hesitant to lend out money now, but I’ve learned that what you said OP is truth, and if I’m to be a better person I need to not hold grudges when I expect others to behave as I would and they don’t. It still eats at me a little, but I have more healing and learning and growing to do so I know it will until I can become my best self and not let things like this make me so bitter and angry....OR expect others to act and think like I would. I’ll only hurt myself with that thinking. \n\nSo thank you for saying this. It is the closure I needed for my feelings.",

This was over a year ago though and I've never pressured him to pay me back, but I have a firm rule that if you ask me for more money when you haven't squared away a previous debt I'm not going to give you any more money until you pay back the previous loan. Also I'll probably adjust how much money I'm willing to loan to you again depending on how you handled the last loan so I'm not in a position where I'm out a bunch of money for a long time if I know that person has trouble paying it back, so if he asked for another $300 after paying off his prior debt I'd probably tell him the most I can do is $150.

Maybe the situation is genuinely really bad, more is okay. Life is shit, then you die - it happens. But I tell them that I don't want to be repaid, it's a finished transaction, *when I give them the gift/cash*. That alleviates stress for them and I don't get pissy.\n\nBut if it's, say, a couple hundred dollars and it's not a dire need, I do expect to see that money again.

Friend A insisted on paying for his pizza because he had been raised in a house where every transaction was zero sum, and everything paid is paid back either as a lone, or good/service. \n\nI began to think about this, and I settled on this point: you *are* paying for that pizza. You paid by being a friend. Every kind thing you did unasked, every time you chose to be a positive impact, that person is choosing to pay you back in a way that doesn't hurt them. In this way, giving out a loan you don't expect back doesn't have to end in \"not being paid back\". If every time you go out, they treat you to a drink, if they offer rides to you, if they offer favors out of no where, they are paying back that lone by being a friend. The best part of being a true friend to someone is that money isn't the only currency in the relationship. In fact, if you really are good friends, it's hardly a currency at all.

Isn't it natural to say 'hey, I'm on a tought spot myself' or even 'I don't feel comfortable, sorry'? Of course I know that there are situations in which people would help regardless, like lending money to a best friend of 20+ years or for a sibling that is in a bad shape because of an unfortunate setback. I've never seen this as almost an obligation as I read here (I might be wrong, sorry). I don't mean to be rude at all, I'm genuinely curious. Cheers.",

            "text": "A couple years back my wife's friend was in a financial bind, well their family as a unit was, and my wife asked if we could loan them about $1,000. Now we're not struggling for money, however that's still a sizeable sum of money to us. The deal was that they would pay us back in small increments over time working out to $5 per week. \n\nDidn't see a single payment from the first month on, though they were still in the thick of it financially and I figured it wasn't a huge deal to us. So about two years after we loaned them money my wife and her friend got into an argument that ended their friendship. My wife, not being one to just let things go then tasked me with getting the money back. \n\nAt this point they had filed bankruptcy to try and put off foreclosure of their house. I had called the old friend to get them to commit to paying us back and their reply was that they technically couldn't now because of the filing but after the five year period I should reach out and try then saying even if they changed phone numbers I could always find them on Facebook. \n\nThey then blocked all social media access to me. I could probably take them to small claims court to try and recoup the losses, but they live in another state that is about a 3-4 hour drive away. I figured that the time I would have to spend to recover the debt, go through the court process and still not walk away with the money that day wasn't worth it. We lent them money so that their kids could be provided for. \n\nIt turns out that this friend was spending all sorts of money on other things during the time she should have been paying us back. Getting $8 coffees on the reg, new phones, expensive house plants, and all sorts of stuff. I'm pretty frugal, I had spending problems when I was younger, but never debt problems because once I had a family I started buckling down and figuring out cost efficient ways to make things work for us. So those spending habits kind of irked me a bit, which I could care less about if it wasn't potentially my money. \n\nI've lived by the \"whole don't lend money expecting to get it back\" credo since I was in high school though, so I was never too bothered in the end. It was a large sum of money, but I knew up front there was the possibility I wouldn't see it again. I rationalize it that in the end we'll save money from my wife not spending big for theirs kids' birthday presents, her friends birthday presents, Christmas presents, trips up to visit them and buying them food and dinner, etc... Another year and it'll have paid for itself. \n\nI didn't want their friendship to end, but it'll be a net gain in the end.",

I had asked a few times before this and he always batted the subject off 'yeah yeah I'll get to it'. He started getting wound up at me when I explained I actually needed it back, maybe he shouldn't be spending so much on nights out with us all when he could have paid me back 4 times over by now. \n\nI wasn't even asking for full amount that I had paid so he could join us, he tried to mug me off and only pay a small fraction of what we had agreed in the first place, so I decided to break down the costs of everything, with bank statements to prove it and equally divided the full costs of both the holiday and the day out between everyone that went in a group message. The group came to the agreement we would split the costs of everything evenly other than personal stuff like drinks at bars. It ended up that he actually 'owed me' almost 3 times the amount we agreed he would pay me back but seeing how much he dicked around with it, knowing I was out of work struggling to even feed myself at the time I stayed firm and he eventually forked out. I know it was harsh but at no point during those months he was short of cash at all. This was some months later I had done this.\n\nWe had a massive falling out, a lot of choice words thrown in there, it essentially came down to 'what kind of mate does that to a friend' to me and 'why have you made no effort of paying up when you clearly could have months ago, I can't even afford food right now!' from me. His opinion is similar to OP's post and mine is pay back what you borrow.\n\nHe won't talk to me at all now, I have no remorse and I am glad he is mostly removed from my life. Do not Borrow money if there is no intention of giving it back, especially if you have agreed to give it back and especially to friends or family.",

He and I basically became best friends and sharing some interesting secrets between us. Anyway, lots of shit was happening in his own life and he desperately needed rent money or just money in general. Over several months I ended up giving him $600. The last few times he begged me, \"C'mon man, I'm literally begging you!!\" and I gave in until finally I had to put a stop to it. Fast forward a few years? Not really sure anymore, he got engaged and is getting married. After I gave him the money, I never saw him again. Aside from a couple of \"hi\"', \"How's it going man?\", I never saw him. My mother will always remember it but often I just tell her that, I paid Andy $600 to leave my life for good. I want nothing to do with him like a lot of people I used to know.\n\nMy Uncle Glen was always in financial ruin for some stupid reason. He'd call on my parents for money cuz he was either in debt or need money for his house. What did he do once he got the money? Goes hunting, Buys new toys, new rifles....What does he NOT do? Pay his bills. Pay off his debt. Then when he runs out of money and asks for more financial help and we decline? Suddenly we're assholes for not lending him a hand. There was a political post that he and my neighbors were arguing on and I chimed in for a bit and Glen and I got into a huge debate over money and politics. I told him how he was a financial disaster that eve if he had $1 trillion dollars, he'd still be financial trouble. After that he messaged my Father to tell me to stop ding what I was doing. Because I was not willing to back down he cut off contact with us and I say good riddance. Although there was one time he did pay them back like a few thousand? I don't remember what the amount was. He paid them back....A full year later.\n\nI had another Uncle Brian who convinced my grandfather to give him $780,000. This was around 2008? I was too young to really know what was going on. Brian made promises to people that they'd never have to work another day in their life, buy their dream houses and yadda yadda. Over time that message became \"treat me like a king or you get no money\" and what became of that? The guy constantly partied his ass off, cheated on his wife several times, financially ruined himself to the point where he tried to take his own life twice! So promises were made to my family only to be broken and made fun off. I think at the time he was on the run, faking his own death and when we was caught, he just packed up and left. Fast forward to today? I believe he's in a hospital slowly dying from cancer? Maybe? Doesn't really matter, he's the only guy in the world that I wish were dead.\n\nBoth sides of my family have a long history with abusing money or being in some sort of financial ruin. Turns out, none of them ever really learned what money is or how to manage it. But they sure knew how to spend it though! Luckily my brother and I made the choice to start learning about money in general to make sure all that crap back then never happens again.",

Just giving people that you care about however much money you can afford to giveaway when they need it totally saves relationships. Don’t try to act as a bank and loan money to friends and family. Give what you can like it’s a charity.
