But i mean that our judgement, laying upon another the blame which is then in question, should not spare us from judging ourselves. It is a charitable service in one who cannot remove a vice from within himself to try to remove it nevertheless from within another, where it may have a less malignant and stubborn root. Nor does it seem to me an appropriate reply to someone who warns me of my fault, to say that it is also in him. What of it? The warning is still true and useful.” \n -Michel De Montaigne",

Big rare cut of meat with water dumped all over it, water splashing around the table, makes the night SO MUCH more fun. After the club go to Truffoni's for sloppy steaks. They'd say; 'no sloppy steaks' but they can't stop you from ordering a steak and a glass of water, before you knew it we were dumping that water on those steaks! The waiters were coming to try and snatch em up, we had to eat as fast as we could! OHHH I MISS THOSE NIGHTS, I WAS A PIECE OF SHIT THOUGH.",
