But i mean that our judgement, laying upon another the blame which is then in question, should not spare us from judging ourselves. It is a charitable service in one who cannot remove a vice from within himself to try to remove it nevertheless from within another, where it may have a less malignant and stubborn root. Nor does it seem to me an appropriate reply to someone who warns me of my fault, to say that it is also in him. What of it? The warning is still true and useful.‚Äù \n -Michel De Montaigne",

I want each and everyone one of you to put yourself into his sandals for a minute and see your future laid out for you. \n\nEvery step forward is a step towards your crucifix. Not only, but your walk of shame will end up with whippings, lashings, a crown of thorns, nailed spikes 7‚Äù long going into your feet and at an angle to boot. Then the wrists to hold you upright as the lungs collapse under the weight.\n\nThis in turn causes water to go into your lungs and bloodstream. It was the position nailed to the cross that caused water to come gushing out later when I was nailed.
