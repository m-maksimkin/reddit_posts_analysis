None of the OG ingredients are rare, difficult to grow, or have a wide price range. Any time you're spending more than $15 a bottle for wine, you're paying for the brand. Don't get me wrong, part of that brand may be a flavor and consistency that you absolutely love, and if it's worth it to you, more power to you.
