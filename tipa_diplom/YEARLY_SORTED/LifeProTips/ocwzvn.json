    "LPT: If you quit watching the 24-hour news-cycle, life is happier.\nThe news is designed to alarm and outrage you. There's not much you can do about it anyhow. The news-cyclers produce a false picture of life by accentuating the negative events.\n\nAn informed electorate is essential, but a short weekly perusing of the major headlines, with any additional web search for points of interest or depth is plenty enough to keep informed. Balance it out by seeking the positive acts of human beings. You'll be a lot happier, and see that humans are wonderful creatures.": [

Usually that’s something written by a well-rounded person who has a particular view/bent/lens on a controversial topic at hand. Should Senate Bill 1234 pass? Pros and cons as seen by Person X. Those are not objective facts. Those are opinions and reasonable/reputable news orgs label them as such. \n\nThere’s a troubling shift in the news now of news orgs being sold off to vulture capitalists (Alden is famous for this), who strip all the value from the outlet, demand that ads be crushed up and integrated into the editorial content, at which point they lose all credibility, and are then sold for scrap. The vultures then leave the dead carcass behind and look for another news outlet to take down, devour, and leave for dead. \n\nNevermind that local news is then decimated.

            "text": "During the pandemic year I've worked to avoid tabloidy/infotainment news sources and to replace them with quality sources. The difference is night and day, I spend much less time consuming news and am much more informed. The hard part is finding good sources that suit your interests. But, a good \"starter pack\" for high quality news sources I would reccomend for anyone looking to go down this path.\n\n1. Breaking Headlines: the [AP](https://apnews.com/) and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) both have nice apps and good websites. They are pretty much considered the gold standard for international news with little to no bias. They still aren't perfect, but the best I know of in this category. I tune in about once every day or two in case something important and current is happening internationally or in the US. Shout out to NPR for US readers as well.\n2. Investigative Journalism: [Propublica](https://www.propublica.org/) \\- Holy cow the consistent quality of the work blows my mind. They're journalism is really impactful and  is regulary cited by politicians and other news networks. A lot of federal investigations have kicked off right after Propublica publishes a piece exposing some sort of fraud or abuse. They always win a crap load of awards and I feel smarter for reading their stuff.\n3. Long Form Journalism/Articles: [Longform.org](https://Longform.org) \\- The antithesis of Tik-Tok like media. They have an awesome collection of recent and non-recent long-form written pieces from a wide variety of sources ranging from about 10 min reads up to 40+ mins. For me this is an antidote to constant rapid fire internet served media that shows be 12 zillion things a second without offering any depth or nuansce whatsoever.\n4. Local Newspaper/Website: A lot of times these can be really great! Word of caution: nowadays a lot have been gobbled up by larger conglomerates (particularly Sinclair Broadcasting) and many are also pretty terrible. It's sometimes hard to know this because these types of 'local' news organizations don't like to advertise that they [literally read off scripts from much larger conglomerates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc).\n5. Biggest Tips =>\n   1. Peck around and find out who funds/organizes/supports your news sources. It will make you more sensitive to potential undisclosed biases you may be accidentally informing yourself with. A lot of time this information is not advertised by the organization itself, but usually if you go to the organization's page on wikipedia they will mention if another company is responsible for funding or running the org.\n   2. Use multiple sources: Often you can suss out biases 'spot the difference' style by noticing information conspciously not mentioned by one source but mentioned by all others.\n   3. It's worth it!!! It takes some time and energy to get going and your amygdala will miss the stimulus from entertainment oriented media, but over time you will be so much better informed/grounded on issues far and wide.\n   4. Make it easy on yourself. I deleted apps from entertainment focused news sources and replaced them with sources I wanted to focus more on. The extra effort of having to type in a web browser suprisingly reduces the chances I will open it up to begin with.",

I used to be a very well informed being with distinguished political views and pointed opinions on most subjects.

Find out what's going on, read some thinker pieces, move on. Get involved locally, be informed enough nationally. You don't need that much information to do your day-to-day things. Then if there are topics that you're interested in, enjoy them in depth with books and scientific articles.\n\nGet your news from trusted sources with less bias. You want information that you can process and make choices around, not be told how to feel. NY Times, Guardian, NPR, WSJ, BBC. If you're truly neutral, AP and Reuters are as cold fact as possible. Other reporting services just copy/paste their reporting. Avoid the sources with heavy leanings. OAN, Breitbart, Blaze, Fox News, Occupy Democrats. They tend to want to dominate and discredit with spurious arguments rather than give you information that's useful to your life. Cool. News isn't sports. There shouldn't be winners and losers. Those sources are not helpful to you being informed. They're helpful to them to keep you tuned in and leaning toward the opinions of people who seem to care about you, but don't. And read your local papers to find out what's going on. Explore the differences between the reporting and opinion. Sometimes they blur together and we don't realize it.\n\nIf your news caters to your point of view if you're liberal, conservative, libertarian, etc. then it's just telling you what you want to hear and not giving you facts. If you find your views are aligned exactly with one party's point of view, your points of view are not your own and it's good to be informed by sources outside of your usual sources. If your news source is regurgitating things in a way that get you charged up or hating others afterward, it's doing that to keep you addicted.\n\nDon't read the headlines and think you're informed unless that shit is cold info. \"This person wins senate seat.\" \"Lakers win championship.\" \"New PS5 games announced.\" That's cold info. \"7 ways in which gun laws are destroying America\" is not news. That's bait. It may have information, but it's littered with opinion that's tempting you to read it because the author has a point of view. It's okay to read that stuff every now and then, it's okay to hear opinions, and you may agree or disagree with those opinions, but ultimately you're better off taking in cold information and coming to your own conclusions, not someone else's, even though it can be boring as shit to read.\n\nAnd just remember that news is just information and that's all it should be. Remember, when you go outside and see the world, it's very different in your local community. Maybe you get riled up all day looking at Trump or Biden and think the world is going to shit. But walk outside. Maybe you live in a decent neighborhood with clean drinking water and solid public transit. Your friends are nice. And while we all go through our struggles and hardships, it's not the end of the world every day. 24/7 news, clickbait news, YouTube news pieces from channels, a lot of them are there to create a false sense of urgency that keep you tuned in. News is good to take in. Information is good. But with moderation and as a way to aid your choices in your community, not to dominate.",

But I was working and my mom was alone.) I got home and police shortly after and I was like... \"I've no idea, I've been at work and just got off\" So they asked if anyone's at home. So they pulled my mom outside who could barely walk while another kept me away in my living room until I pushed past him telling the cops my mom has cancer and this is stupid. I went outside to shout in hopes neighbors would witness and got a noise disturbance out of it. Trying to argue that I wouldn't have been so loud of the police didn't show up with a false accusation of my mom didn't work. They said it doesn't matter the reason, I had to pay the fine. Which ended up with several more noise complaints.. I have to be at work at five thirty but she can blast Phil Collins through the night and the cops would only bother me!\n      Sorry. My mom's cancer got terminal. I quit my job to do front desk work... It got too tough moving that hard with only my thoughts. Someone told me to get it together and I walked out.
