We always romanticize specific elements of the stories we tell. \n\nThen they emphasized, everything you see on tv is there to entertain you. It’s supported by adds, so the more entertaining, and the more people tuning into a channel they more money the show (or news) will make.\n\nOnce you put a filter on when watching news that it’s entertainment, then it will make a whole lot more sense. Yeah they may be telling some truths on the news show but ultimately it’s there to entertain it’s viewers to gain advertising money. That’s it. \n\nFor example, if I’m telling you a story about how I walked across the street to get a drink from 7-Eleven, that doesn’t leave a lasting memory. Instead if I embellish  the details then you can make a story that’ll grab someone’s attention. \n\nI was up all night and suddenly realized I was dying of thirst, so I jumped out of the house, and proceeded to walk  to 7-Eleven.  On my way there I was so delirious from my lack of thirst, that everyone who passed by me gasped as they walked past me. I stumbled up to the intersection and waited what felt like an eternity for the signal to go through its cycle so I could finally walk across the street. Sure enough, as I walk to the front door someone asks me to spare some change. So I reach into my pockets and gesture, that Im broke. I make my way into the 7-Eleven, and am instantly overwhelmed by the amount of visual noise going on as I try and make my way to the drink section. Once again, I have to decided if I want pure mountain spring water, volcanic glacier double filtered water, or double filtered tap water. I’m so delirious and thirst that I just grab the first bottle I see. I turn around and can’t move because the line to check out is down the aisle all the way  to the drink section. After 20 people enter through the door while the line inches closer to the check out, I proceed to get anxious by the amount of people in the 7 eleven. I finally get to the cash register and am able to pay for the water and leave  the crowded 7-Eleven. As I exit and cross the street I take my first sip of the refreshing water and instantly know that everything will be fine. The cool water on my lips are equally as refreshing as the dew in the air in. As I walk through the bright and dark patches from the street lights I feel refreshed and make my way home knowing I was able to satiate my thirst.",

A good chunk of it is going to be negative. And a number of sources are going to rile you up. Idealistically it's a tool to inform you how your government is spending your resources and how you can take action to be a part of your community and participate in government activities.\n\nWhat changed over the past several decades is that news wasn't a paper you picked up in the morning and read before dinner. It then was on cable. And post 9-11 everyone wanted the news faster. Stories were meant to keep you on. CNN went from boring stories about foreign affairs to constant breaking news. Conservative media grew. Media people would have news wires they'd monitor. Then everyone got Twitter. More \"news\" sources grew, and many of them catered to audiences that could selectively listen to them. Opinions got mixed with facts. The need to profit from people's attention and fear grew. And the news became much worse.\n\nFrom someone who works in media, this is the better way to look at things.\n\nTake in your news for a limited amount of time every day. 15 minutes. Whatever makes sense. Use fairly objective sources. AP. Reuters. NPR. Read your local community papers. Read past the headlines. Understand what's important and relevant. Read the bills or studies or whatever people are talking about yourself, don't just accept their analysis. Don't engage in the comments section. Engage where you choose to make a difference (city hall meetings, charities, etc.). Move on.\n\nAvoid listening to too many political analysis podcasts or having cable news/internet news as your primary source. And definitely avoid getting your news from Facebook or Twitter. Those are tailored to you to increase your emotional engagement and thus click on stuff at the cost of your sanity. Heck, there are so many articles out there with titles similar to this LPT. They'll bait people to click on them with seemingly absurd positions, but a lot of people will agree and find an enemy in something. You don't need to fall into the bait and you don't need this stuff on all the time. Facts, not sentiment.\n\nAnd take stock of what's important. You do need to be aware of what's going on in the world so you can vote accordingly or help important causes. But you don't need to know things about celebrities, stupid things a political leader said, or any filler stuff that doesn't matter. What's going on in your community and how can you affect change at a local level. A lot of the rest will be theater and noise.\n\nBut overall, yes. We don't need instant media all the time. Go in, get your facts, then limit your screen time from that stuff.",

Edit 2: Some people seemed to have thought I was implying you should only ever read one source exclusively for some reason. So I guess I have to be more clear for the easily confused. Obviously, as anyone would tell you, you should use multiple sources, particularly if it's a major topic. No one source will be perfect all the time, but neutral, high credibility sources will generally be better choices than those of notable political bends.
