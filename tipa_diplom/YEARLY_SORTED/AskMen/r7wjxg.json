            "text": "Everyone seems to be consistent with saying she sucks and isn't worth it. I would offer one counter argument....\n\nIt is possible she has been in serious relationships her whole life. Probably just got out of one, and wants, for one time in her life, to be truly single and date around, before she starts a new serious relationship (with you).\n\nIn this light she may consider you a very good candidate to settle down with. And her up front honesty with her intentions may actually be a good thing.  Few people are this honest and direct and this kind of honesty can be exactly what it takes for a relationship to work.\n\nEveryone trashing her saying that a few more dicks shouldnt matter if you two like each other...but many many many relationships fail because one or both feel like they did not have enough sexual partners in their life and get the urge to experience more.  The very people trashing her my have these exact thoughts themselves.\n\nBasically I would not write her off as a terrible person. She did not have to be honest with you like this and may very much be into you and value your opinion.  She could well be a bad person or sleep around alot (in and out of relationships) but i feel like people like this would not be up front about these intentions.  \n\nIn the end it is up to you to decide if it is worth it to wait. People get very hung up on monogamy and how many partners a person has had.  Love and bonding go above that shit in my opinion.  Cheating may be unforgivable, but sounds like that is something she doesn't want to do...or she would have never even mentioned this.\n\nGood luck either way",

There are a lot of things about relationships that are socially expected that might not actually be natural to us, that are residual influences from a time where marriage was about necessity, ownership, religion, or social status rather than love and mutual respect. As an example, do you expect your friends to only be friends with you, or is it ok for them to have other friends as long as you're always invited? Sounds almost silly, but our perception is littered with things like that, most of which we just default to what's \"normal\" rather than actually considering what we want or need.\n\nFigure out what YOU actually want from having a relationship, and be open to those things showing up in unexpected ways. Also, recognize that people are flawed and always changing, so rather than focusing on what a person is, I'd recommend on focusing on how a person thinks about things, and how they handle stress.  A relationship with someone who is adaptable and open-minded is going to last a lot longer than one with a person who is nice to be around as long as the conditions of their life are good. You're never going to be able to opt out of difficulty in a relationship, or in life for that matter, so it's how well you overcome those difficulties that determines if it lasts and if it's fulfilling.\n\nIt means something that she was willing be honest with what would be considered a socially ugly need. She could have told you what you wanted to hear, and then just tried to get the rest on the side which, I suspect, is what happened to many of the jaded people in the comments. I don't think they necessarily prefer the truth, I think they just want things to be how they want or expect them to be, even if that's not real. All those people saying she belongs to the street or whatever garbage, I hope they saved/are saving themselves for marriage, otherwise they're being hypocrites. People with substance are not without flaws, some flaws are just more socially acceptable and tolerated than others. I imagine they will be disappointed by people often in their lives.",

He knew I was interested in her and invited her over to his place for drinks through text while I was with her getting coffee on a walk in the park. I had no idea but could tell she was uneasy about something. Finally she came out with it letting me know about the text before the walk was over. She acted like she didn't know what to do, which seemed absurd to me... but prior to us meeting that day I'd let her know my interest in her, hence why we met for a stroll in the park and had also been casually hooking up prior to this. \n\nI tell her point blank \"I know how he is. For the health and wellbeing of our relationship, if you value it, do not go over there.\" With as serious of a tone and expression as I have ever mustered.\n\nShe went, hooked up, and called me in tears about 3 days after. She asked to come over and I obliged having no idea whats going on. She comes over and curls up on me, hugging me, asking for a kiss. I do my best to calm her down and I set her aside on the couch  and she begins telling me everything that had happened.. I hadn't asked and didn't know... then proceeds to tell me how she said he \"saw no future with her\" after they finished having sex for the third consecutive day.\n\nI felt bad for her. Got her some water and tried my best to not lean heavily into the \"I told you so\" speech, limiting it to \"this is how he is, this is what he does\" because, well, he is a manipulator.\n\nAt the end of our conversation she asked if she could stay the night with me, which usually meant spooning, sex, and lots of heavy petting. It was difficult, but I told her I felt uncomfortable trying to continue what we had based on what I just learned, and thought it best if we didn't. \n\nToday we are still relatively close friends, but despite my sexual attraction to her body, I have absolutely zero interest in pursuing anything outside of a platonic relationship.",

While in reality it would be the other way round: you would be the one constantly working not to lose her, while she had you hooked...\n\nChange roles: assume that a woman you are not initially physically attracted to would love you unconditionally: you would feel flattered, but your intend to make her happy would always be like paying an emotional debt, not a natural drive. That guilt will eat you up from within over time, until you learn to relax and care less for your commitment: but if you are no longer committed and never really loved her, it’s over anyway!\nThe only way out would be to assume that you can really learn to love her! But can guilt really turn into love? Or if you didn’t care from the beginning: how long will it take for not caring to turn into caring? It’s a bet on the future, or rather more like a mortgage: you are betting the house! Back to the original scenario: assume your unconditional love stops after a few years - you think she is letting you go, if she married you for her material safety and status? She’ll take your right arm in the process...\n\nEdit: There is another option I hadn’t considered: you let her exploit you without never getting anything back, and you are fine with it. In that case: go ahead. But don’t be surprised if your undying love somehow turns to hate later on.",

A couple of months ago I reconnected with an old friend. We have now been dating for a few months. At first he kept telling me to go out and date other people. He has said many times he wishes he wasn’t my first post divorce relationship. He thinks post divorce people should get out there, date, mingle, etc. he is afraid that at some point I will leave because I did not take the opportunity to date around.  Even though he suggested that I date around I chose to only date him. Maybe he is right and it will backfire, maybe not. For me, dating this guy felt right, I didn’t need to test the waters, honestly if he wasn’t an old friend I probably wouldn’t be dating anyone.  After many bad married years, I was finally happy and loved being single.",

Personally, if I could go back, I would not have married the first woman that I dated. And I would not have gotten engaged to the second woman that I had ever dated. Now that I'm on a third serious relationship, there will always be the underlying tone that both of us are individuals and free to do whatever we want is long as it's respectful to the relationship. The only reason I got to this point and trying to build a healthy relationship, is that after my second long term relationship, I played the field for a while, met a few people, good experiences and bad, and then met this third relationship completely by accident. Other people have said \"Don't be her backup plan\" And I agree, because even though I have found a new confidence with the opposite sex, I am completely happy right now and can't even think about other women. So the fact that the girl that you're referring to is talking about wanting to date other people first, means that she isn't on that level yet. Go and live your life man, go and be one of those other dicks for other women, find out what you like and what you don't like, and f*** your way to exhaustion",

I just I wanted to be with this girl more than anything in the world. \n\nDana used to work at a bar downtown which was a good 30 minute drive from where I lived but I would blow gas to just go talk to her because eventually she'd get the fucking hint right? Well Dana would damn near bang any guy but me. I think her requirements were anyone but me lol. Finally I decided to be a man and tell her how I felt. So we went out for beers and I told her I would love to date her. She wasn't rude or anything but she went \"look I think you're handsome but I would rather play around than be with you\". I knew I couldnt just be friends with this girl so I cut off ties for for own mental sake and moved on. \n\nI found out later she had a lot of personal problems and baggage that would've made my life a nightmare. I've dated some absolutely gorgeous women since then, played around a lot, and have had so much fun I don't even think about her and when I do I'm just glad I didn't make the mistake of being her \"back up plan\".",

She broke up with me so she could try other guys. She made it clear at the time that she wanted to do that and then get back together. Our last month living together until she found a new place she was a little hurt that I lost all sexual interest in her.\n\nWhen after a few months she started texting me questions about wanting to get back together and saying things like wanting to have my babies, I largely ignored her. At that point I knew she had already found a new boyfriend but she wasn't happy with him. She later asked for a FWB relationship that I knew was her way of trying to get back together. Turned her down. The whole situation was just gross and she had lost all value in my eyes. She later ended up marrying some chubby beta orbiter she had known for years. So I guess it worked for him",

Maybe she likes you and sees you as someone she could stay with for good, but maybe she doesn't feel ready to settle and wants to explore her sexual life enough, so that when she picks the person to stay with, she can be sure.\n\nPeople say \"bullet dodged\", but actually, it would have been worse if she hadn't been open with you and had dated without being true to herself.

If you let people treat you like shit that’s all you’ll ever be so unless your like a super sub or something I’d suggest work on yourself first before you even think about relationships. Adapt to the new age and “do you” sex ever abundant and mutual love is a rarity so focus on yourself to become worthy of the girl you deserve. The kind that has a job but still rubs your back after work, the kind to make ahegao faces and dress up, the kind that can cook because even if you can to it always tastes better when someone else does it, the kind with the instinctual need to please you as strong as your own to love and cherish her, yeahhh, some of you know wtf I’m talking about. There is no future for you there is just NOW until one minute your dead.

Girls in these situations vary on thier break up coping skills, the girl I was crazy about didn't want to sleep with any guys, even went to sexual rehab then \"found more religion\" and lived out of her car a couple years traveling. Each girl varies on finding themselves so OP don't wait and be a back up because you will be missing out on life while this person isn't. I joined the military and traveled the world, which opened my eyes to how many women thier are around the world and you are a \"10\" somewhere haha",

I didn’t want to but I couldn’t put myself through the pain she put me through, again. I still had feelings for her and decided that maybe if we were separated, living separately that we could work things out and start again. Turns out she moved on almost right after it was over. When I told her how I felt and that we could give it another try, she informed me that she would be willing to take it slow again but she wants us both to date other people and have other relationships before we can try again. While I do see her side, maybe we don’t know what we want and seeing other people will make us realize what that is. For me, if she has relationships/sex with other people, I don’t think I could try to make it work again. It was 10 years and I’m only 30 this year.. 1/3 of my life spent with a woman and she wants to see other people barely a couple months after the separation. Oh and it’s worth mentioning we have a 5 year old son. Moral of the story.. I wouldn’t recommend putting yourself through the stress of waiting for this girl to finish having her fun and end up finding out someone she met was who she wants to spend her time with now, not you, and you waited for her.

            "text": "I’m going to chip in my 2 cents because my girlfriend sort of asked me this and I said yes. She did go off and date someone else but we have now been together for 5 years and I couldn’t be happier. Worked out fine for me. There’s a very firm sentiment in this thread but I want to stress how much this depends on who both of you are and your priorities.\n\nMy GF and I started dating while she was in college, I was not in school at the time. She was very focused in having a normal college experience, and she had to get on a train for a few hours to come see me so she only did that on weekends. \n\nVery soon after we started dating she broke up with me because she felt that she had feelings for someone else on campus, and that she felt like she couldn’t be with me and have the college experience she wanted to have. I said that she was fine to break up, that we were still friends, and also that I still wanted to date her so if things didn’t work out with this other person I would still be interested. \n\nShe started dating this other person and he broke up with her in 6 months. She had a perfectly fine, non-abusive, but ultimately underwhelming time I think. We started dating again after that and we’ve been fine ever since.\n\nI just think that people often have the idea that maybe the grass is greener on the other side, and that by sticking with you they are throwing away opportunities they will never get back. \n\nPeople can have anxieties about committing themselves to partners where they might think, “ what if my partner becomes an asshole in 5 years, and I have no one to go to because I never made any friends in college because I spent all my time with my partner”.\n\nThis is especially true for women, as they are more likely to be financially dependent on their partners and they inherently have less time to decide to commit to a partnership because they  need to have children before they turn 40, and building a relationship that can handle that takes time.\n\nAnyway, I honestly think that her asking you this might be a positive thing for you: it means that she agrees to dating you, it means that she doesn’t want to cheat on you - she wouldn’t be sleeping with people while in a relationship with you as per her suggestion, and it might mean that she considers the prospective of a successful relationship with you so likely that she wouldn’t have the opportunity to be able to “sleep around” because y’all would go off and get married and have a monogamous life.\n\nLook, everyone wants to sleep around a little bit, like at least for a little while, just so you’ve done it and have the life experience. Unless you’ve got some weird religious or moral stuff, but even then you probably still want to, you just don’t want your friends to know.\n\nOr she maybe her ideal boyfriend material is doormat in which case you should run and never look back OP. Totally depends on how she said it.\n\nAll I’m saying is idk what you’re priorities are. If the thought of your crush sleeping around before being with you ruins her for you, then don’t date her I guess, or communicate to her that she can date you now or not at all and let her make a decision.\n\nTL:DR : I did this with my girlfriend and it worked out for me.",

You deserve security and certainty, and she needs to want to try and be the best for you, not just settle because her other options didn't work out.\n\nWhat you will likely *actually* do;  Not date much because she's hurt you, and let's face it, women have more options than men and they know you're more likely to still be single when she's looking. And deep down, you fear how few options you might have.\n\nThen when she's ready you'll ignore your worries and start dating her; after all, *your* heart was true, and you're prepared to put the work in. Then you'll slowly catch deep feelings for her, until you're totally in love...\n\nBut she'll likely still be thinking about how she could have done better. Oh, a few people below claim they found their life partner like this, but the odds aren't good if this is where you started. And every now and then she'll say \"Ok, we aren't committed yet, I'm going to briefly sleep with someone else.\"  Or she'll say \"Do you mind if I go with this guy, just for Kink X that you don't want to do with me?\".... And it'll rip your heart out, because you love her.\n\nBut you'll let her go, because after all, 1 guy is less than a few guys, so she's getting more attached to you, right? And you want her dreams to come true, and when she's filled out that bucket list, she still needs to tick off \"Marry and stay with one guy\". You can wait out one more moment of freedom. And she does come back. \n\nBut then she goes with another. Then another...\n\nEventually she'll completely leave you when she finds the one she's actually happy with. Or just do something so unforgivable you have to break it off or you'll tear your own heart out to stop it tormenting you. And you'll torture yourself to madness because now your love knows all these amazing memories you had with her; the time you kissed on a beach. The time you made love under the stars. But she's doing that with someone else now. Why couldn't she see how special what you had was? Why doesn't she come back and just put that little extra work in...?!\n\nBut she was *never* thinking like you did. Oh she had great times, but she was always, *always* wondering how much better she could have done than you. Because you never stood and defended your own worth, she never thought you were really worth the respect and dedication. Maybe she never even thought at all. She'll say things like \"I didn't mean to hurt you, I guess subconciously I knew I wasn't happy with you.\"\n\nSo... Is *this* the future you want for yourself? They say it's better to have loved and lost, but you'll know *exactly* what you've lost if you go down this path. And it hurts far, far more than just saying here and now \"No. This isn't respectful of me. I won't let you do this to me.\" \n\nSo tell her that.",

The second relationship was not a good match, and I finally ended it. But not long after, it started escalating w/ a guy friend I had for a while. I REALLY didn't want to jump into a relationship at that time because I felt like  I never had the time in my life for freedom, or to be single, or go on dates like people in college. I could have easily said something like the girl above if he asked me to be exclusive too early. However, after playing hard to get for a long time with him and some serious consideration, I decided to be with that friend because I really felt like he is gonna be the one. 5 years later he is still the one. However, I occasionally still wonder or feel fomo what it would have been like to date around, be single, or have that period of freedom that I will now never get the chance for in my life. That is what I was struggling with when we started dating. I think that getting it out of the system sometimes can be a good thing. However, you take on the risk that 1) she will never come back around to you  2) she will devalue you for being so lax and lose respect for you/ use you 3) she is just a bad person. At the very least, if you opt this route, you shouldn't jump into relationship with her too quickly after that.",

No judgement on you or what you’re doing, but I can’t be a part of it.”\n\nAnd I’d treat that in my own mind as a potential relationship that didn’t work out, and is a dead end.
