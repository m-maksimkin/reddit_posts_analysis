I’m a woman and it’s clear men are not taught about vaginal health, and women are taught not to talk about it- so I don’t really blame anyone. I just wanted everyone to know that if a woman’s vagina smells foul- like overpowering- this doesn’t really indicate poor hygiene. It typically indicates (usually) that there is some sort of bacterial infection (vaginosis or vaginitis), which can be caused by over bathing, too many hot baths, swimming, antibiotics, hormonal changes, scented soap- the list goes on. Vaginas should be washed with mild, unscented soap, and water that isn’t scalding hot. I’ve found that taking daily probiotics is essential to maintaining a healthy biome. There is a chance that the smell is caused by trichomoniasis, which is a very curable STI. The bottom line is that vaginas do not smell like roses, but their smell prob shouldn’t knock you over either. If it does I would recommend gently suggesting to the lady that you guys take it slow. After all, if she has a bacterial infection sex with likely be painful. Or, I guess you could always be honest. It will be embarrassing, but maybe she can’t smell it. Maybe something like “ I don’t want you to be embarrassed, but an ex gf of mine had a bacterial infection and I’m noticing you have the same symptoms. We probably should hold off on sex bc that will be painful and make it worse.” Assure her you aren’t grossed out, after all it’s a human body, you’re just concerned for her comfort and health.",

Why this was odd? I was not that attractive, didn’t get attention from women and had literally never dated before. So the reasons I turned her down?\n\n\nFirst my mom loved her. My mom hates everyone and is the religious/judgmental type, so if she loved someone something isn’t right. The only other girl my mom approved of, or pushed me to date was some girl my age at church who was literally just as judgmental and religious as my own mother (that was a hard pass for me, not interested in dating my own mother). \n\n\nSecondly she had crazy eyes. I don’t know how to accurately describe it, but something about her stare was off. \n\n\n\nEnd of the day turns out I dodged a bullet. I’ve run into various guys who dated her around that time of after high school and they all had the same kind of stories and issues. She was a liar, a serial cheater and had some really weird sexual kinks. She enjoyed pain and was obsessed with “bigger” guys. So for the guys that weren’t above average she’d have them do all kinds of crazy things so she could “feel it” since they couldn’t get the job done.",

She has a rather large tat under her breast, and some lines done on her side, and it just killed my attraction to her immediately.\n\nI don't know just how she really truly felt, but we were pretty close and had been slowly getting more and more flirty with each other, and we had arrived to the hike together, prepared together, etc. After it though, I just immediately sent off a different vibe, and I think it showed sorta, and she subconsciously realized that I had friend-zoned her. \n\nWe stayed friends (and, nominally, still are friends to this day), but the closeness petered out. I'm sure she felt a little confused and betrayed since it seemed like I lead her on. She moved a while back for work, and aside from a few comments on FB, I haven't really kept up with her so much.",

            "text": "I’ve always been the sort of person that once I discover a flaw or idiosyncrasy in someone else, it’s all I can focus on. As a result, when I was younger, I broke up with several girls over extremely superficial things I couldn’t get past:\n\nI was dating a girl in college who was smart, funny, and gorgeous. I broke up with her because she used childish abbreviations constantly whenever she talked (like saying “whatevs” all the time). Everything else about her was great, I couldn’t get past how annoying it was when she talked like that.\n\nI broke up with the last woman I dated (before my wife) because she was a picky eater, and it was embarrassing to go out to eat with her due to the laundry list of substitutions she’d request every time she placed an order. \n\nI broke up with a high school girlfriend because her favorite movie was “Chairman of the Board” (starring Carrot Top). I thought she was joking for a few months, but when I found out she was dead serious, I peaced out. I can’t imagine anyone who has watched this film can blame me.\n\n The one that may be the most superficial is when I broke up with a girl because she had weird nipples. I know nipples come in all shapes, colors, and sizes, and I’ve never cared one way or another about how somebody’s nips looked, but this girl’s were on a whole other level. They were tiny, but extremely long, like well over an inch in length. The best way I can describe them is that they very closely resembled one of the rubbery strands of a Koosh ball. You 90s kids know exactly what I’m talking about. I was constantly terrified they were going to rip off while we were fooling around. Another funny thing is that this girl had a substantial stutter, which never bothered me in the least, but her nipples were an instant deal-breaker.",

Really big in its heydey but each sub forum had its own distinct culture. Anyways I hung out a lot in burnouts which was the drug talk section of the forum. I ran across a picture of a girl who was making a really stupid face while she was on klonopin. Like so dumb that I saved the post because it was ridiculous how ridiculous she looked. \n\nLater that year i started hanging out with a girl in real life and she would come over to place apartment sometimes to smoke pot as college students are known to do. \n\nSummer vacation happened and I did LSD for the first time. She came over while I was tripping and we went out to the balcony to talk. She got in really close for a kiss and in the weird half light I had a startling moment of realization. She was the klonopin girl from SA. \n\nI freaked out because in my drug addled state I thought it was some kind of conspiracy orchestrated by the government to catch me while I was high or Ashton Kutcher type prank’d deal so I backed away immediately and kicked her out of the apartment. \n\nI felt bad about it afterwards because she was cute but like I could not handle the internet and my real life colliding in such a strange way. \n\n\nAnyways she’s like a veterinarian now or something so her life turned out ok. \n\nE: just looked her up on FB she’s pregnant too.",

I sent her an email on AOL (my older brother made me an AOL/AIM account when I was in 3rd grade) letting her know we would no longer be “dating” each other because I THOUGHT that SHE THOUGHT she was better than everyone (due to her superior hearing, although I didn’t specify that).

Well she greets me a couple days later with very, very short hair, and I immediately break up with her. I know she did it because she wanted to feel special that I would make an exception for her and all that, and thats like 20% of the reason why, because I don't play those games in relationships, and thats usually the reason I told people I broke up with her, but a good 80% or more was just because it looked extremely ugly on her, she could not pull off that look for the life of her, and it wouldve taken months to grow back",

No joke my roommate / best friend of 8 years so he didn’t have to Sugar coat anything would text me at 3 or 4 am saying “hey I don’t mind a moan every now and then or y’all hitting the wall but I can hear Amys half of the entire fucking conversation like she talks louder then she moans” she’d sit in my lap facing me late at night and we’d talk for hours and i tried everything short of saying “let’s use our inside voices” because I wasn’t ganna talk down to a girl smarter / older then me like I was speaking to a 5 year old.

Beautiful girl, amazing in bed, excellent body, sweet, caring... But I could not stand her perfume. One of my biggest regrets in life is probably not talking to her about it. I just ghosted her. It was not that she was wearing too much perfume, it was just that her perfume was very very very very unpleasant to me.\n\n- Too loud in bed. In my defense, it sometimes felt like it was intentional. Like she was trying to get her roommates to listen to how much fun she is having.\n\n- I had arranged to watch a football game with friends and she made me go to a party or something. I never forgave her about that and split up with her a couple of weeks later.\n\n- Too much squirting. There were other reasons involved in this one, but I had to fucking steam-clean my couch like twice a month and at some point, I had to add plastic sheets on top of my mattress (under the actual cotton sheets).\n\n- I once split up with a beautiful girl because she wouldn't send a message and I wouldn't send a message. So, basically, we were dating for like 3 months, I send her a \"good morning\" message and she does not reply. I do not want to send anything until she messages back, so we never sent a message to each other ever again.

She was cool, we had a decent amount in common, I was excited for our first date. The morning of our date I went golfing with a couple friends of mine. I went home, showered, changed, and went to meet her at the movie theater for our date. We drove separately. She told me she drove there in her mom's car because she doesn't have a car (she was 20). That's fine although of people don't have cars. As we're walking in to the movie I realize that I left my wallet in my golf bag(not my finest moment). Since the movie was about to start I asked if she was okay with paying for the movie, then we, or me by myself, could swing by my place so I could grab my wallet, and we could go to dinner. This was pre-covid at a pretty inexpensive theater, the tickets were $6 a piece. She tells me that she doesn't have enough money in her bank account to cover the price of the tickets. At this point I knew this wasn't going anywhere so I figured I wouldn't waste time going back to my house to grab my wallet. I grabbed a few bucks that I had in my car and we went to the dunkin across the street and had coffee and finished our date. She was perfectly pleasant, but I already knew there would be no date 2. It wasn't just because she had no money, it was because she didn't tell me beforehand that she had no money, and we made these date plans together. Like, obviously I was planning on paying for everything, but the fact that she knew she couldn't pay for anything at all and didn't let me know before the date just didn't sit right with me. Anyway, I hope she's doing well.\n\nTLDR: She had $0 in her bank account and I am not a sugar daddy.",

So it's a hard nope for me if I find out she's more then 3 years younger then me, could be a solid 10/10 and I'd still politely decline.",

Something about that question reminds me of speech class. It makes me feel awkward and completely interrupts the mood. I’ve ghosted a couple of girls for asking that question. And you can never explain that to them, because it looks like you’re trying to hide something. But that’s not it at all, it just feels unbearably awkward when they phrase the question that way. I feel terrible about it too, because often it’s asked by shy girls who are trying to put themselves out there and I’ve totally been there.
