I mean women just have softer bodies and skin that is so nice to touch but it's the emotional softness I'm talking about. Everything they do just seems so much more graceful and delicate. Even those heavy handed hard assed women posses this trait. They feel like home or safety. Even though I am physically larger, stronger etc she made me feel safe. \n\nI used to lay awake in bed and think while my wife was sleeping next to me how incredible it was she was there. It blew my mind that it was just a whole person who is so beautiful who has arms and legs and thoughts and feelings and she was sleeping next to me.

When talking to guys I often get the impression they're trying to prove something about themselves or sth, and it gets very tiring. Don't have that with women, perhaps because they obviously don't feel the need to prove their masculinity to me, or their feminity for that matter, since I'm obviously no competition on that front. It allows for much more pleasant conversation when the person opposite isn't trying to one up you the whole time. Of course there are exceptions in both genders, but in general I find women easier to talk to as such. They seem like they are more open to be themselves than most men",

Whenever they move, it's almost a theatrical performance which makes it even more baffling since often times they are unaware of it. And a lot of the times, it's soooo subtle.

See when I was just a young lad I learned about the magic of love making through my college professors estranged wife. She was a culinary master and the best dish she served was the classic baked beans on grilled cheese that her family often ate for generations. Every night after our passionate love making we would sit together at the dining room table that once belonged to my poor old professor, and we would have baked beans and grilled cheeses. It was simply orgasmic, in multiple senses of the word. We would sit and fuck and eat and fuck some more. Sometimes she would lather herself in the molasses sauce and then get me to lick her clean. Other times we would swap the beans between our mouths until they were too disintegrated to recognise and then one of us would swallow it passionately. Ever since those nights together before she passed away, I have been in love with women, beans, and bean loving women. She inspired me to start my farm out here in Nevada and I've been loving it the whole time. So I hope with this story, you can understand why I own and operate a bean farm and why my comments take a turn for the bean, and not just a woman's bean to be flicked, but to baked beans and grilled cheese.",
