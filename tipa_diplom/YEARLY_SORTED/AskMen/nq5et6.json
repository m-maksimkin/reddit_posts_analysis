The latter group is both a regional competition in three parts of Italy (seriously, in Toscana, Romagna and Veneto they take pride on the fine art of creative bestemmie) and also [literally illegal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law): you can be fined if you use a bestemmia in public and while the common swear words are used frequently on the localization of movies and TV series, it's almost unheard of bestemmie on TV and if it happens usually is on live TV and it's followed by apologies from the network, public indignation (because people have nothing better to think about) and an official censure of the perpetrator. Also, bestemmie are extremely commons when old people play cards.\n\nSo, back to the strongest I've heard. Years ago someone cheated in a game of Briscola (local game of card), one of the old dudes got up EXTREMELY pissed and started the phrase with, and I quote:\n\n\"You son of the infibulated mother of Jesus, the fuck was that?\"\n\nNever heard anything like that before, never topped it after.\n\nFun fact for the anglophone, the translation in Italian of \"cunt\" is considered one of the most mild and common swear words.

You \n uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you‚Äôre an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It‚Äôs hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind‚Äôs greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who‚Äôs soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in. But than again, you are so incredibly abominable that you would probably be able to surpass the worst conceivable failure a living being could possibly make. You are so incredibly pathetic that you are honestly not worthy of any more of my words nor my time. Just know that I will forever detest you for your failure and everything you stand for, and that no matter what happens, I will never ever forgive you",

There are 3 phases to Marine Corps bootcamp.  The first is insanity and nonstop chaos to break you down, the second is to start teaching you basic Marine stuff (rifle, history, practical field stuff ect) and the 3rd phase is to build you up into the new image.  By 2nd phase you're expected to be doing a lot of stuff on your own and are supposed to be at least somewhat competent at daily tasks, like shaving once per day for instance.  \n\nFoolishly, midway through second phase, I had run myself short of time during hygiene and thought I might get away with not shaving just this once as we had to be 'on line' to do our end of the night rituals.  Enter Drill Instructor Staff Seargent Flores, our 'Kill Hat.'  (Kill Hat's are the youngest and meanest Drill Instructor in the platoon)\n\nSSGT Flores puts us all on line and proceeded to to his hygiene inspection on the whole platoon.  Often a Drill Instructor would do this alone by second phase.  He walks down the line, checking recruits fingernails and asking them general orders and whatnot, but I notice hes looking at everyone's shave.  Each person, and I'm thinking 'oh shit.'  I was a pretty good recruit, but I knew this would get me slayed.  \n\nSure enough he gets to me, looks me up and down, and a little closer at my little 18yo peach fuzz poking out and asks \n\"Did you shave, recruit?\"\n\"NO, SIR!\" I belted out\nAt this point he just goes completely ballistic.  The inspection had been fine until me.  He's screaming and is bouncing around in front of me wildly, and I'm just standing at attention continously screaming back \"YES, SIR!\" And \"AYE AYE, SIR!\" at the top of my lungs.  \n\nHe stops his screaming and looks at me very sternly.  He gets RIGHT UP into my face, past my face and into my ear.  Hes practically standing ontop of me with his hand at his hips and whispers into my ear, for no one else to hear \n\n\"Your mother must have been some kind of whore to have fucked whatever retard your father must be to have made you.\"\n\nAll I could say was \"AYE AYE, SIR!\" at the top of my lungs.  \n\nIt stuck with me for a while, but much later it dawned on me that he probably finds a way to say that gem to a recruit every cycle.
