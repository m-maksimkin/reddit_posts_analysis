Which was very rare because they‚Äôre quite a small school. So, my friend invited me to come watch the game.\n\nWe‚Äôre sitting up in the stands. And the game is very competitive. And at one point a girl on the team I was there to support kind of crashed into someone, as you typically do in soccer. And she fell down on the ground. You might say the girl was slightly more ‚Äòportly‚Äô than the other gals. But‚Ä¶they‚Äôre in high school so that‚Äôs relative. Also she‚Äôs a soccer player. \n\nAnyways, there is a guy sitting in the stands behind me, who has been rooting loudly for the opposing team the entire time. He‚Äôs about fifty years old. And he shouts, ‚Äúyeah stay down, fatty!‚Äù\n\nI was like hol up.\n\nI turned around I said, ‚Äúexcuse me?‚Äù\n\nHe was like‚Ä¶ all angry and attitude, ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm like, ‚Äúdid you seriously just say that? that girl is less than half your age‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nHe‚Äôs like, ‚Äúyeah so what?‚Äù\n\nSo I say it again louder so other people in the stands nearby who might have missed it hear it: ‚Äúso you think it‚Äôs okay to just yell ‚Äòstay down, fatty‚Äô to a 15 year old\ngirl?‚Äù\n\nHe‚Äôs a little more quiet now, but he still is acting like there‚Äôs no issue.\n\nI said, ‚Äúyou should be ashamed of yourself. That‚Äôs completely inappropriate.‚Äù\n\nHe was like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù And was being rude still. \n\nJust shocking what some people will say. \n\nHe moved away from us at halftime.

            "text": "Throughout middle school and high school I was bullied by this kid named Brett. He was just an overall douchebag piece of shit. He targeted the foreign girls and the younger kids, basically everyone vulnerable. I think it was because he was short and pathetic.\n\nI was one of the tallest kids in school, I was still dealing with my Aspergers (a high functioning form of autism), and I was also generally loud. So I kind of stood out, which put a target on my back. I was picked on and teased regularly, but Brett was the one most often for some jab or comment. I didn‚Äôt have a lot of confidence and was generally non-confrontational so most of the time I just took it, though I was raging on the inside.\n\nThings finally came to a head in my senior year of high school. Now I wasn‚Äôt the most athletic, but I enjoyed gym class as much as the next kid. There were enough friendly kids to have fun with so it wasn‚Äôt terrible, but I shared most of my gym classes with Brett and his prick friends. They were in varying degrees of asshole though and a few of them I was on friendly terms with. But not all of them.\n\nA popular form of mocking they engaged in was when they were on another team and they would either surround me so I could never get the ball, purposely block me, harass me or try to get me to pass it them in the heat of the moment. That last one really pissed me off the most. Once or twice when I was younger I did pass the ball to someone on the other team and then on they would always say, ‚Äúpass it to me‚Äù when I had the ball and they were on the other team. It was as if they were mocking my intelligence and it made me want to wrench their heads off.\n\nAnyway, our gym teacher filled a soccer ball with helium for a game. It was really fun!!! The ball would go so high and we would all crowd underneath it and try to be catch it. This is when my height came to an advantage! I was able to jump up and peg the ball to my team before anyone else could reach it. \n\nWe were having fun and enjoying the game, I don‚Äôt think anyone was keeping score. It was just mindless fun. Someone kicked the ball at the other end of the field and we were all crowding to get it before it landed. I was getting ready to jump up and peg it when I hear Brett in his mocking tone say ‚ÄúOP pass it to me, pass it to me.‚Äù I ignore him as usual, jump and peg the ball back towards my team. \n\nWe all run after it, some of my classmates congratulating me on my move, when I hear Brett call me, ‚ÄúRetard.‚Äù Under his breath.\n\nNow I HATE that word. Despise it. No matter how it‚Äôs used. I worked hard with my Aspergers and I knew other and worked with other kids with much more severe cases of autism then me. All social situations everyday are a struggle and assholes like him didn‚Äôt make it any easier. \n\nMaybe it was just all the years of abuse, taunting and mockery by him and others boiling over, but when he said that word I just snapped.\n\nI stopped, turned, stared at and marched towards him. ‚ÄúWhat did you just call me?‚Äù I ask\n\n‚ÄúWhat did you just call me?‚Äù I repeat, my voice rising in anger.\n\n‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST CALL ME?!?!‚Äù I scream and shove him hard backwards.\n\nWhat happened next I don‚Äôt remember as I think I was so furious I blocked it out. But what I do know is that little weasel faced fucker never looked at me nor said two words to me ever again after that day.\n\nSometimes I wish I kicked his ass when I had the chance. Probably would‚Äôve killed him. But I‚Äôm satisfied that I put that little douchebag in his place and just wish I did it sooner.\n\nBrett Tarnell if you ever read this, Fuck you you pathetic asshole!",

Anyway, I was leaving class as she walked in and we met in the doorway and she squeezed herself into the doorframe saying \"ew ew eew\" when I walked past and giggled with her friend. \n\nI didn't even acknowledge her, say anything, change my pace, nothing. But inside I was devastated, and that's the one moment I remember to this day that I was genuinely upset by something someone did to me.\n\nIf interested, she turned out to be a bully and generally a huge cunt, cost me my first summer job as her dad was my dad's boss, we both worked there during the summer for about a month, I was getting along nicely with everyone, I always prided myself on my politeness, and suddenly I was called into the boss' office, told I had made other employees uncomfortable and he'd rather I stopped coming to work.\n\nCaused a huge uproar, cause when I was working I'd be jamming to music on my earphones doing everything right while she and her friend sat and made nasty comments and jokes on my behalf that the staff heard and thought she was a little shit. She started working there as management right out of school. \n\nUltimately jokes on them, cause it was a photo-developing factory and it shut down a few years later.

A couple of days later, still no contact so I call in and ask how she is.  She opens the door just in her dressing gown...\n\nI don't remember much of the first part of the conversation; but she tells me \"I'm a woman, and I've got my needs, and you could never satisfy them\".  She then says \"Come here. Come stand next to me\".  I do, and she points into a mirror, at my reflection in it, and says \"Can you imagine any woman ever wanting that?\"  By this point I have no idea how to react, and she says \"I'm going to go over campus and fuck this guy who I actually like. Drive me there. And turn around\".  She's between me and the door, and I don't know what to do... in hindsight I should have pushed past her, although hindsight also says how laying a finger on her could have gone badly; at the time, I was just too shocked and I turned around. She gets undressed behind me, and I can still remember hearing her slide some silk underwear on; the stupid thing is, I did actually drive her across campus. Don't know why now, I thought I was being kind I suppose.\n\nLater, one of our mutual friends warned me she was telling everyone she knew what a push over I was, and to \"borrow\" things from me and never give them back... I ended up seeing her once more to collect all the music I'd lent her, and going around to another mutual \"friend\" who had shortly after \"borrowed\" a lot of my course books, and getting them back from her too. Said girl never said a word to me afterwards, so probably *was* taking advantage.\n\nAlthough it messed me up very badly at the time, I've had *alot* more success with women since. The memory doesn't ever stop hurting, but memory isn't destiny, and I've proven her wrong time and time again. The important thing is to maintain your own sense of self worth and the value of treating people with kindness even if someone has been evil to you. I still run into the odd screwed up person, because damaged people will see kindness and want it, or think they can abuse it; but I've learned since how to set boundaries and not be ashamed of protecting my own health and safety.",

Every student in the class suddenly had four times the amount of work to do, a week before finals, through nobody's fault but whoever fucked up the timely rollouts of the material as it should have been delivered to us.\n\nI basically had a breakdown. Did the best I could with the not-those-four-exams work I could still submit on time, and planned on leaving the class material alone for the rest of the quarter, and out of stress I didn't respond to family checking on me.\n\nI've had several crash-and-burn moments like this in past classes, and I'm always worrying one way or another about doing well and not ending the quarter in a state of hating myself for not getting the subject and wasting the money of people who'd paid my way.\n\nMy mother, undiagnosed untreated Cluster B personality disorder (probably closest to borderline, if I had to pick) came to my front door shouting and fuming, and tried to herd me into her parked car before she would let me explain myself. My first mistake was leaving my home. I am proud though of insisting that I get out of the car to avoid a panic attack.\n\nI didn't avoid a panic attack. The sight of me crying didn't move her. Explaining what had happened with my class didn't move her. She only cared about me not keeping in contact. Not about *why* I hadn't been keeping in contact.\n\nI don't know how she lives with the notion that her behavior is what causes this reaction in me. I've had three panic attacks in my life, and the least bad of them was when I was visiting a friend in his home; he pulled out an Airsoft gun that didn't have obvious \"this is a toy\" coloring. The other two came from my mother.\n\nI don't remember exactly what she said in that moment, but it was close to, I'm the person she has the least expectations for.\n\nI don't know why I wrote all the rest of this, but it makes sense for me to remind myself of all the context, I guess, and the reasons I've stopped maintaining contact with her.",

I just can‚Äôt work more than 3-4 hours a day.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just being lazy.‚Äù I still work, clean my house, take care of my cat, and occasionally cook meals for my parents. Tell me what part of that is being lazy.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always on your phone. You obviously don‚Äôt care about anyone else.‚Äù I‚Äôm on my phone because (1) that‚Äôs where my medical records are; (2) it hurts to carry anything heavier; (3) my mother and father, whom I live with, are gone most of the day. What else am I supposed to do?\n\nI‚Äôve also heard from doctors:\n\n‚ÄúYour labs are fine. You‚Äôre not really in pain. It‚Äôs all in your head.‚Äù Yeah, thanks, because I totally wanted to spend a crap ton of money for you to say I‚Äôm not in pain, like you can feel my body. Besides, you of all people should know that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of conditions that don‚Äôt show up in labs - like genetic conditions or rare diseases.\n\n‚ÄúPhysical therapy didn‚Äôt work? Oh, then there‚Äôs nothing I can do for you.‚Äù Really? What about a chiropractor? Pain medicine? MRI to make sure you‚Äôre not missing anything? Obviously making my ankle pop out of place right in front of you means I‚Äôm faking it . . . because everybody can pop their ankle out. \n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a drug addict/You just want a pain treatment.‚Äù No duh to the second one. I‚Äôm IN PAIN. I want a treatment. But no, I am not a drug addict. I can‚Äôt even take most oral medications because of a GI issue. In fact, I‚Äôve asked doctors multiple times if I could lower doses so I didn‚Äôt have to be so reliant on them. That‚Äôs totally drug-seeking behavior.\n\nOh, and my favorite one:\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have EDS. You‚Äôre too young.‚Äù First of all, sir, you never even checked my physical symptoms (super stretchy skin, easy bruising, joints popping, extreme hyper mobility, all of which can be tested without any labs). You never did any genetic tests for it. And you obviously never cared to research it because the average age people develop EDS is 18-19 years old, and I am 20. I‚Äôm not too young.\n\nA year or so down the road, I swapped doctors because I was fed up with mine (5 years of searching for answers for multiple problems, and no doctors had ever believed/tested for anything other than the norm). Within eight months of seeing this new doctor, I had three diagnoses. Within another two months, I had four. And guess what? One of them was EDS. \n\nValidated. \n\nI hope this brings some awareness to those about how difficult people with disabilities, particularly invisible ones, have it. Particularly men. Sometimes I think men with invisible disabilities are nonexistent in the minds of m doctors. \n\nMost doctors don‚Äôt even test for rare diseases, so most of us go undiagnosed. I think that needs to change! \n\nOn the bright side, I am so thankful for my current doctors and nurses! They are very kind, caring, and sympathetic, and they will listen and believe me without question. It is because of them I finally got diagnosed, and I will always be grateful. Make sure if you become a doctor or nurse you do ALL the tests before ruling the person a liar. Thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",

If it isn't at least a size too big, I can't wear it\n\nThis of course means that my favorite shirts will be too big to wear in public if I'm ever able to lose the 90-ish pounds I still have to lose, but knowing my luck, that'll never happen no matter how hard I try lol",

I still was to go through many more treatments and lots of appointments.\n\nFirst day back, I had a meeting with my surpervisor and the department manager.

I said that I should be good to do all the usual duties but sometimes the shifts would interfere with my treatment plan.\n\nThat's when the surpervisor (a real c-word if I ever meet one) proceeds to tell me that won't do. That I must adjust my treatment plan so that it would not interfere with any scheduled shifts. She goes on to say that it's up to me to cope my illness, not the workplace. I was stunned at her complete lack of compassion, especially since we worked at the hospital in which I was recieving the treatment. \n\nOf course, the department manager (her boss) speaks up and tells her that it does not work that way. She tells her that my treatment plan is set in stone and the workplace MUST work around it. Unfortunately, that manager left a year later and the c\\*\\*\\* was promoted to her position.  \n\nFor 3 years, I not only had to struggle with fightting for my life (3 weeks of chemo every 6 months, cystoscopy every 3 months and another surgery) but also the managers lack of compassion and refusal to adjust the shedule to acomidate saving my life.\n\nIn early 2019, I retired and at the exit intervue with HR, I sighted her behaviour and attitude as the primary reason I was retiring early (55 instead of 65).",

It was web development, so yeah it wasn't rocket science but there was a lot of work to be done and very hazy requirements that I as an engineer was trying to get clarification on and work with amidst these deadlines.\n\nI came to him to tell him about some difficulty we ran into with the design of one of the features, and I no longer remember which one, but I remember what he said to me.\n\nHe looked over at me just long enough to say \"**Look out there. (points to the rest of the studio)  They're the ones doing the hard stuff.  You do the easy stuff.**\"  And then went back to looking at his computer screen.\n\nThat was it.\n\nHe didn't address the problem I had brought up, instead he tried to guilt trip me into shutting up and sitting down.  It was a long time ago, but I've never forgotten that moment and how it made me feel.  I had no idea what to say: I was already sleep deprived and terrified at the idea of losing my job \\*before\\* that comment because it would have ruined me, so I just shut up and sat down, and started working even later hours instead.  I stopped asking for clarification, and stopped asking him questions.  It terrified me that the person who I perceived was at least part determiner of my financial future valued what I did - specifically me - so little.\n\nI get the feeling that he was at least a little resentful about being the producer of the website team rather than the team working on the core product, and I think some of what he said was a reflection of him believing that the core product was something that required skill to work in and that web development wasn't.  But I wasn't in a position where I felt at all safe to pry into that, so a lot of that is my own assumption on his motivations for saying that admittedly.\n\nFortunately he didn't stay in the company long, but I wonder both what was going through his mind at the time to make him say something like that, and whether he continues to use that \"management style\" with other people at wherever he ultimately ended up.",

Worth noting at this point I've been in college for a few years and we never really talked about all the things he put me through, they ended up just swept under the rug. He's doing somewhat better now, the last time he did something inexcusably awful while drunk was 2 years ago, but it spanned about a decade in total without him ever apologizing for any of it, and that's just what I've experienced.\n\nAnyway, he decided to tell my friends, almost if he was bragging, that he knew his kids would never become alcoholics because he \"scared the hell out of us\". Proceeded to recount a time he picked me up in his truck from the elementary school bus stop, drunk of course, and ran off our driveway on the way back into a big pile of tires, which is really one of the milder traumatic memories I have of that period of life. At my birthday lunch, to my friends and girlfriend.\n\nMaybe it's just recency bias but I thought that was pretty bad. I later texted him asking him why the hell he would say that and reminding him of one of the worse occasions, he apologized somewhat but I got a text from my mom saying what I said was \"absolutely true, but bad timing\" because he's been depressed for the past couple of weeks and is really upset with himself now. Which, I mean, good? Also told me that I need to \"learn to forgive\", that we \"can't change the past\". But now I feel guilty for sticking up for myself at all.",

So one day she just didn‚Äôt text me, like hours on end and luckily she shared her location with me at all times and forgot to turn it off and I found where she was at. She was at her ex‚Äôs house for hours. So I screen shotted it and sent it to her dad, me and her dad were pretty cool. He didn‚Äôt know what was going on between me and her and thought everything was perfect for us. Until he said she was acting strange as well. So I sent the screen shot to her dad and her dad drove over to that house to see what was going on. Me and the dad where on the call and apparently, she was getting fucked by 4 dudes all at the same time. The whole phone call goes quiet, then her dad says ‚Äúwell, your ex bf is on the call because he was worried about you and so was I. You just lost one of the greatest men you can possibly imagine‚Äù and I hear her scream \n\n‚Äúoh that half a man, yea I‚Äôve been using that piece of shit.

Well, then one of my classmates noticed, and instantly loudly exclaimed \"YOU SURE LOVE SHOWING OFF THOSE SCARS!\" His tone was so rude and accusing, like he was claiming I did it for attention. As if I hadn't been hiding for months. Well, I went right back to long sleeves after that. It's been years, but thinking back to that still makes me angry. Self-harm addiction is no joke, it's not an attention thing. I struggled with it for many years, and that incident really hurt my self-esteem.",

The person I lived with at the time had been caught lying about having contact with my ex and hiding it for years, as eell as a few other lies and wrirdness. Obviously, we weren't on the best of terms but it wasn't overly bad, just tense. I was sick in my room for about 3 weeks before I finally took myself to the hospital. I told her I needed to go and she suggested I take an ambulance because I was on assistance and it was free. I expressed to her that I felt uncomfortable using that resource, and took a cab. While at the hospital I was told I had pneumonia and they would know by the end of the oxygen treatments if I would need to stay or go home. I had a dog at \"home\" and since my roomate made no effort to help me with taking care of my dog (never mind myself) when I was ill in bed, for weeks straight not eating eventually being barely able to stand, never mind walk) so I was concerned and told them I can't stay. They gave me options of temporary shelter and so on, so I told my roomate that someone would be picking up my dog. She became offended and insisted she was \"not an asshole\" and would help with my dog. \nThankfully, after the treatments I felt good enough to return home. Upon leaving, a nurse gave me a bunch of masks and told me to wear it in public and even around my roomate and her kids (which is where I caught a bad cold from her daughter that became pneumonia) to protect my self from catching something as my immune system was compromised, so I did. \n\nMy Roomate took the whole thing as a personal attack on her. She implied several times that I was faking being sick, eventually telling me I barely left my room for a month, coughed endlessly for weeks of that time, because I was \"trying to bring everyone down\". \"Everyone\" meaning her, as her older kids were living with their dad's primarily and her baby at their dad's half the time.\n\nThat's not the worst she said though. Months later she fabricated slander against me on facebook, not thinking I would find out. But that's another story.",

Woman answering because this one is pretty gender neutral. \n\nShe lived with us, and when I was a little kid (3-4 ish) she told me that if I let the shower water pound on my chest I'd develop a heart condition and die. I wasn't really allowed to shower, but when I did she made me face away from the water the whole time and I was just petrified that I was going to accidentally kill myself. \n\nShe believed this because she had a son who had been born with a major heart defect. I doubt that a doctor told her about the shower thing, it almost had to be somebody else, but who the hell knows. She thought it was a rule. My uncle passed away when he was 10 after a mitral valve replacement.\n\nWhen I was 8 or 9 or so I started having chest pains sometimes. By that time I was allowed to shower and sometimes faced the water. I was utterly completely convinced that I had given myself a heart condition and was going to have a heart attack and die and that it was all my fault. I let the shower water beat on my chest and she was right and that was it, I had thrown my life away. I gave myself a couple panic attacks centering around this and one of her other rules (no smiling as you are going to sleep because that means you are going to die; I spontaneously smiled so laid there waiting to have a heart attack and had a panic attack instead). \n\nAnyway, I had chest pains on and off and never told anyone. I was convinced I was dying, bartered with god for more time, etc. and eventually grew up and didn't die. However, when I was in my 30s I found out I had a leaky mitral valve that doesn't even need treatment. That's what the pain had been when I was younger. \n\nI spent a decent chunk of my childhood convinced I was dying but afraid to tell anyone. My family did not react normally to anything being wrong with me (if at all possible I was blamed, even if it was something genetic. If not, then the two sides fought because each side swore there was nothing wrong with their genes. It's insane. Even now I can't tell my mom anything medically wrong with me without her blaming me and then claiming it has to be my dad's fault). I was depressed and terrified a lot of the time. I put off riding roller coasters. I thought I was going to die whenever I had gas or anesthesia at the dentist. F that shit.",

Why didn‚Äôt my parents tell me? Do my parents know? Do I need to call them? \n\nMind you my grandmother passed away not 3 months earlier.

Well one year, when I was 12-14 (not 100% sure exactly), his single mom got on the crack, and he came to stay with us for a summer. I'd never liked his mom, because she treated him like shit even when she wasn't using, but he loved her anyway so I never spoke a word of it.\n\nWell, one day she comes crawling back‚Äìshe kicked the habit and she just \"wanted to be with her babies again,\" so off he went. Few days later she's dropping him off because her dealer came through with some more junk (she never told us that, but I know how she operates). He shows up and wakes me up to let me know he'll be staying for a while again.\n\nApparently, in my very groggy and barely-conscious state, I said something hurtful about his mother. I did not realize I had done this, and did not know until years later, after we reconciled. So a week later he and his mom moved wayyy out of town without telling me anything; one of our mutual friends mentions it off-hand how he misses him so much, and then explained the situation.\n\nSo, I call him. We have a very short conversation, where he tells me the following: (for context to why it was so hurtful, I was very socially awkward, had zero confidence, smelled like cigarettes because parents chain-smoked, etc)\n\n\"I'm glad I finally got out of there, so I can stop pretending we're friends. You were just a tool; I used you so I'd have a place to stay, and being your friend got me other friends because everyone feels sorry for you.\"\n\nDude apologized profusely years later, and explained that he was hurt by my words and acted a fool.

I sat quietly because I didn't know how to react because this woman had been m best friend for the last 6 or so years at that point and I believed that the was sincerely asking. But at that time I couldn't believe she actually said it out loud.",

When it was my turn, the coach said, \"Kenny isn't very good and he knows it\".  That was it.  I sat down next to my friends and was just crushed.  Not only did he say it, but he said it in front of all my friends.  I was 11 years old and will never forget the feeling.

There was 1 class a week where I didn't go due to rugby commitments at school. This was when they were alone together in class and that's where they started hitting it off.\n\nAnyways, when I found out from another friend of mine that went to that class that he was noticing they were talking a whole lot and laughing etc.\n\nBasically before I go to call her after finding out the next night, her friend had already texted me saying **\"You're out of the equation, don't bother her anymore, she's happy now without you. At least let her be happy since you don't deserve it\".** \n\nMy girlfriend blocked me on myspace and MSN (This is 2009 btw, facebook hadn't quite taken off yet) as did her friend after texting me that hurtful message. To this day, I can still vividly see the phone in my hand, an old Motorola Razor Flip phone, with its tall slender font style, with the hurtful message therein. \n\nWe still continued to see eachother at Karate, and my best friend wouldnt talk to me either.

I was heavily pregnant with my son, and when I say heavily I mean not only was I like 7 months along but I also weighed 300 lbs when I gave birth to him.  I weigh half that now.  Anyway, I was working at a big box home improvement store and was walking to the service desk to start my shift.  I passed by an older couple, smiled, and said hello.  They smiled back as they passed.  Then I heard the wife say ‚ÄúThar she blows!‚Äù as in: I‚Äôm big as a whale.  Fuck that bitch.  If I hadn‚Äôt been at work she would have caught these whale hands‚Ä¶fins.  Whatever.\n\n2. I had a group of friends that I met working at said big box home improvement store.  They were all about 10 years younger than me, but they were fun to hang out with.  One night we decide to go bowling at a trendy downtown bowling alley/bar type place.  When I bowl, I bowl for real, so this place was not my bag.  Lanes were dry as shit and the scoring machines were wildly inaccurate.  Anyway, the music they were playing was also not my bag so I was talking shit, cracking jokes about the music, etc. just being my self.  I said something ‚ÄúUgh!  This music sucks!‚Äù  My friend‚Äôs boyfriend looks at me and says, ‚ÄúWhat do you know about music?  You‚Äôre just a mom at home.‚Äù  For the record, I have a career, a house, a family, etc. and so forth.  He worked at the Buckle in the mall.  I was so fucking pissed I never talked to any of them ever again.  \n\n3.  My mom is a narcissist, so we‚Äôd be here all day if I listed all the shit she‚Äôs said to me over the years, but here are two of my favorite from her:\n\nI was 10 years old.  She looks at me and says, ‚ÄúGod!  You‚Äôre already getting fat!  Look at your butt.  It already folds over your legs.‚Äù\n\nJust before my husband and I got married, my sister called me crying saying she needed to tell me something but didn‚Äôt want to hurt my feelings.  She said she was having dinner with my parents and my dad was eating really quickly as always (retired military, shovels it with record speed).  My mom said to him, ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt plan on eating like that at the wedding.  Lord knows [My Name] will be stuffing her face the whole time.‚Äù  I confronted her and she denied saying it.  I didn‚Äôt let her deny it so she said, ‚ÄúIf I did say it, I don‚Äôt remember.‚Äù  If that‚Äôs not malignant narcissism I don‚Äôt know what is.\n\nEdit: so yeah, I obviously didn‚Äôt read which subreddit I was in when I posted this.  Enjoy nonetheless.",

I know you have your if‚Äôs and but‚Äôs, but this is my life, and I need to worry about myself for once.‚Äù \n\nThis was the last thing I ever heard from my ex. I had known her for 3 years, dated her for that long. To make an incredibly long and frankly, stupid story short. She treated me horrible, and I was way too clingy. She would go radio silent for a month or 2, and then message back with her ‚Äúheyy‚Äù. I was in probably the worst point of my life. I had nothing. I thought I was in love with her. So I took everything she gave me. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs love right? It‚Äôll all work in the end. We‚Äôll move in together, start a family, we‚Äôll be happy.‚Äù \n\nTo skip over the incredibly long laundry list of things i went through, she told me she was committed to a mental hospital (she had recently gone into therapy for her untreated PTSD) and she loves me, she‚Äôll message me as soon as she can. And I felt so so guilty for not trusting her. There must be some glitch why her Xbox profile has me blocked. Must be some reason why her social media gone silent. \n\nWord of advice? That gut feeling, telling you something is wrong? It‚Äôs always right. Please, please listen. \n\nI eventually found out she was lying from a profile picture change. See, we used an app called MeWe to talk. And one day, I annoyed her by asking how she was doing, and she decided to block me to punish me (explained herself but never apologized). But I‚Äôll always, ALWAYS thank MeWe for allowing me to see her profile picture through some unfortunate glitch. And one day, some 44 days after the ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù message, what do I see? But a new picture. \n\nSo I confront her. And I was so, so goddamn low. I told her I would forgive her but we can keep trying. I loved her. I‚Äôve always hated just how lowly I treated myself. Worse than fuckin dirt. \n\nTo which she sent me that message. And that was the light. The moment of 3 years of stress. Of pain. Of worrying if the girl you ‚Äúlove‚Äù is going to be alive tomorrow. It wasn‚Äôt my problem anymore. I wasted every single moment she‚Äôd ‚Äúspare‚Äù for me on her. I always was there for her. Thick or thin. And she was never there for me. Not once in her life did she ever let me vent to her like she did to me. She‚Äôd just leave. Or hang up. And I took it like a bitch. I saw red. More red than the 1984 Soviet Victory Parade. \n\nSo I blocked her. Deleted her off everything. Come to find out, yeah, all those guys ‚Äúnot to worry about‚Äù, she was fucking. \n\nAgain, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm gonna get some comments calling me Satan or whatever. I wasn‚Äôt mr.perfect. I was depressed. Too forgiving. Clingy. I wanted someone to love and love me. She told me herself, multiple times actually, ‚Äúyour too nice to me.‚Äù It took me a while to realize it wasn‚Äôt a compliment or a thanks. \n\nNeither of us were good for each other. And truth be told? I haven‚Äôt been happier without her. \n\nEdit: sorry for my stupidly long rambling, just woke up from a bad nightmare about her, and this post was a good change to process it. Sorry if I‚Äôve offended anyone.",

Had a close circle of friends and I suppose you could say I was on the edge of popularity - my way of defusing tension or dismissing an insult was through comedy and cracking jokes. Most people liked me even if they weren't friends or at least they could recall my name. I'm disabled, I have cerebral palsy which is hemiplegic. As a result my right arm and hand are notably awkward and I walk with a clearly visible limp. The fact that our school was practically reliant on staircases made it even more obvious. I was bullied now and then but after a while it became a lot less frequent, except for one person. \n\nThat one guy, a rugby player called Alfie who was basically at school to play rugby and occasionally play the clarinet (as if to prove he wasn't some genetically engineered sports god) made it his mission to make my life a misery. Pushes that would knock me off balance, cruel rumours that everyone believed before I'd heard of them, and pretty much every disability related derogatory term and slur in the book. I hated confrontation so I never said much, but one day he tripped me over in the corridor, and shoved me to the floor again. The following line went something like this.\n\n\"Jesus Christ, retard, you are clumsy aren't you? Fucking spazzing on the floor all the time? People like you are draining the NHS anyway - shouldn't you be in a special retard school? Personally, I think you should just do everyone a favour and kill yourself.\"\n\nNow, as someone who has been discriminated a lot in life, I've heard my fair share of 'retard' and 'spastic'. As a suicide attempt survivor though, that comment about killing myself sort of brought up the red mist. Nobody had ever said something that cut so deeply before. He hung back, and I could tell both he and the small crowd of students around us were expecting me to say a witty comeback, take a few slaps and slope off to my next lesson. Instead, I punched him in the face. Didn't really have the effect I hoped and I ended up taking two punches to the stomach before a teacher intervened. We were both suspended, and even though he still bothered me after that, it was to a much lesser extent than before.\n\nTo this day I still think about how much those words hurt.

            "text": "\"Thankyou everybody for focusing, unlike Nate (not my realy name), who obviously can't focus\"\n\nThis was in middle school 8th grade, and I was just beginning to realize that I may have ADHD. My dad (divorced) couldn't afford any medical and didn't have time to get me to any doctor, checkups even. I've only just heard about ADHD and started doing personal tests to see if I had it. And it seemed like it more and more. When the teacher called me out, she sent me out of the class for distracting the person next to me. I went around the corner (which was like 3 feet away) and sat down against a wall and cried. I was quite because I didn't want to disturb the class, but I also didn't want to be found crying. She left me out there till the end of class. Apologized for sending me out, explained what I did wrong, and then asked me if I'm okay. That's when I tried to tell her I might have ADHD and I'm not trying to cause her any problems, and that I'm sorry. I was pretty messed up for the rest of that day. \n\nOntop of this, I was a huge people pleaser, so this took a huge shot to my ego. I still think about this event for the rest of my life. I even remember this teachers last name, and the subject she taught. And every time I think about how poorly I'm focusing, I think about that event. I still haven't been \"seen\" for ADHD, but am beyond certain I fall under that category. And have just embraced it and learned techniques to manage.",

I initiated the break up because I had really fallen out of love with him, mostly due to me coming to the realization that it was incredibly one sided. The entire relationship was wrong from the start. I was 16 when I met him, he was 24. I had always been on the chubbier side and so boys my age were never interested. Imagine my surprise when an older, mature \"man\" was interested in me. This is the same story you've heard a million times. I was 20 before I really came to terms with what was happening. He didn't really love me. He never took me anywhere, none of his \"friends\" knew who I was or that I existed at all. So of course neither did his family. My parents almost disowned me after they found out I was with him. But I was young and thought I had my very own Romeo and Juliet thing happening. Anyway, the break up is happening. It's pretty amicable, seeing as how it was never really love on his end. But to end things nicely, he told me he was never really attracted to me. I had a pretty face but he didn't like my body. The one he used. The one he coerced me into giving him. Now, and in every relationship since, it's hard for me to believe and/or trust almost any appearance based compliments. It has definitely put a good dent in my life.",

One afternoon, a few weeks in, I‚Äôm having issues with some pieces of gear. \n\nOne of my Drill Instructors ‚Äî the Heavy Hat ‚Äî walks up to me, and while showing me how to fix the gear right, he asks me, ‚ÄúRecruit, did you have a dad growing up?‚Äù\n\nI reply no, and he says, ‚ÄúI can tell.‚Äù Then he walks away.\n\nIt was the only time in my five years in the Corps that I almost cried.

I let the conversation die so I guess I fulfilled the \"never talk to me again\" task.\n\nSpouse: Who needs you?\n\nChild: something along the lines of \"I hate you.\" I figured the child needs therapy, which they seem to rather enjoy.\n\nMost of these are forgotten; I remembered them while reading this threat. \"Never talk to me again\" hurt the most even though it was probably not the most serious out of these, coming from someone I never met as opposed to ppl consistently in my life. But it had such a visceral quality to it. I thought about it every day for two years. Now it does not hurt anymore.",

            "text": "I‚Äôve been through a ton of bullying ranging in everything from my voice to my appearance, but the words that have hurt the most have been from my own dad. He was a controlling person sometimes. He talks crap about everyone else in the world because he‚Äôs not satisfied with himself. He compares his children and pins them against each other so they never truly get along. My brother and I would get in arguments sometimes, and he would relay things my dad would say to him. He said it‚Äôs my fault my mom got sick and died, even though I had a super close relationship with my mom towards the end, and she would open up to me about a lot. I was a somewhat difficult child at home/school due to some mental health issues, but I don‚Äôt think anything I‚Äôve done was ever that bad. I had pretty bad OCD, and some sensory issues. Immigrant households just don‚Äôt take mental health seriously, and will only put you down/ beat you for everything. My mom would hold some jobs here and there, but my dad would constantly tell her she‚Äôs working for no reason, and just constantly put her down for something. It‚Äôs like he has this fake idea in his head that he‚Äôs this big guy who could provide everything for his family, but he really can‚Äôt do it alone. She tried to help out financially, but he‚Äôd always talk her down. She never stood up for herself. She asked me once when will I do something big for her. She had barely any emotional support. I remember a lot of things that she would have to do alone. She raised twins and another daughter on her own while my dad was at work. Then he would come home, and she‚Äôd take care of him too. My dad would barely ever want to show up to games, graduations, etc. unless it was my brother playing. I saw a bunch of signs of disease prematurely because I didn‚Äôt have many friends, and would spend so much time with her. I think my dad should have made her go to the hospital earlier. I would try to tell her go to the doctor all the time. I know she didn‚Äôt want to put a burden on anyone. She came home crying when she found out what it was, and my dad was just eating lol. He would let her spend nights in the hospital alone, and my siblings barely even cared enough to visit her. He‚Äôs a super emotionally distant person. He holds a grudge against women, and is also known to be racist. He‚Äôs passed the hatred down to my siblings. My sister once when we were visiting her grave said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what happens when you don‚Äôt take care of yourself‚Äù. She‚Äôs a narcissist just like him. Or another time when we were visiting and I turned the volume up in the car to lighten the mood up and he would say ‚Äúhow is a man ever going to love you‚Äù. You do one thing wrong and he holds it over your head. My parents would I think intentionally try to put you through the same things they‚Äôve been through in life. For example: not teaching you how to do basic things, not really caring who you‚Äôre hanging out with, not taking you out to do things and learning about things you‚Äôre interested in. I feel like with more money my mom could have divorced him, and given us a better life. She always wanted to do more with family, but my dad was a super antisocial person. They were both angry people at times, traumatized from war and their own shitty childhoods, and I truly don‚Äôt think either of them were emotionally or financially ready to have kids, but my mom had a different look in her eyes. You could tell she was a better soul.",

I've got some self confidence issues and other issues that tend to keep me from having a normal social life so this was a big change for me personally. My best friend at the store was the assistant manager and for the first year or so it was one of the best friendships ever. Around my last year his whole persona changed. Long story short he ended up stealing from the company and using MY name to do it which cost me my job. The actual store manager was one of the greatest people I've ever met and because of the ranking difference and him helping at other stores I didn't spend as much time with him but I loved working with him all the same. When shit went down he was very kind to me and I was told through the grapevine that he did everything he could to keep me on the job. I had been sent home and had to wait for a phone call from corporate to see what my job status was when I was let go. By this point I had even been trusted with a key to the store for opening and closings. After the corporate call I had to drive to the store and turn the keys in to the manager. When he took them he told me that even though the assistant manager had used my naivete and trustful nature to ruin me, he thought I was a good person and he did not want this experience to change me from that. I remember he was barely able to prevent crying when he told me that. Compared to what so many other people have gone through I know this isn't the worst situation a person could end up in and I am grateful to God for that, but for me this has been the worst experience of my life so far.",

As we got a little older that stopped, but in the last year of the relationship I got heavily addicted to opiates, started with a prescription. Anyways, after putting both of us thru a lot I decided, on my own, to tell her everything and check into rehab. 2 days before I left to better myself, I relapsed one last time and when I came clean that's what she told me. The thing is she went to treatment for alcoholism, so when she was telling me I'm a worthless addict and I'll never change I was like but you had to get help.. and she said \"I am nothing like you\" and she's damn right. One year clean and I realized I am nothing like her, I am not a heartless cunt",

I was very tired by the time all this rolled around, and at the same time, was *killing* it in my career just beforehand -- things were finally looking up, so the fall was that much harder.\n\nThe woman I was dating at the time, who I thought I would marry, told me that, because I was in generally a negative headspace and was having trouble adjusting to my new limitations and accepting my new reality, she didn't believe that I would make a good father and no longer wished to have kids with me. She expected me to grin and bear it, to adjust to my entire life collapsing without any outward signs of negativity.\n\nIt had taken me years to get to where I could open up and ask for help -- previously I had been much more emotionally closed and would just bottle things up -- and, though she had stated how much she loved my emotional maturity and openness *before* all this happened, when it came time to put up or shut up, she ripped my heart out in the worst way I can conceive.",

I listened, I defended her, I‚Äôd watch her kids so she could have some time to herself, I‚Äôd clean her house, I even gave her a foot massage and a pedicure when she was nine months pregnant and her husband was being an ass. I just wanted someone to talk to when I was sad and She said she just couldn‚Äôt deal with it and I asked too much of her. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever have a best friend again.",

He started seeing someone new . I honestly didn‚Äôt have a problem with it. Then ig he screwed up with her, so he begged me to get back with him. I was like maybe let‚Äôs not get back together.  Let‚Äôs just stay friends maybe we‚Äôll give it another try in a month or two.  Then he tells me they had sex (we were both virgins promised our fist time to each other). So understandably I was hurt. So I asked him how would he feel if I had sex with my friend then he called me a whore. (I‚Äôm still a virgin) He didn‚Äôt understand why I was so hurt and still doesn‚Äôt. But he‚Äôs blocked now for real this time. But I forgot he had my email so he emailed me 2 months ago and I blocked him on there. Basically any bad thing he‚Äôs ever told me he‚Äôd blame his depression or medication for saying it.",

The reason it hurt so much? When I was around 12-13 my mom lost custody of me and my sister because she was a drug addict. Her whole life fell apart and we were stuck in it. The drugs likely are what killed her in the end too, she had a heart attack. Was cremated, never got to see her body, never got to say goodbye... I grew to hate her for the drugs.\n\nSo when I got called an addict, you have a fraction of an idea how much pain that might cause and dig up.

It bothers me being called an Oreo when I‚Äôm not one I feel like there is this thing where if u were blessed to have things growing up u aren‚Äôt considered to be real black if that make sense I can‚Äôt describe it",

Got into a heated argument, ended with them projecting that I would never understand them and that if I had the same experiences I would. They never really ever told me what these experiences were and used them as excuses to treat me like shit. I just felt we needed a break but they decided, our friendship wasn‚Äôt worth it, I presume because I was calling them out on their bullshit and they knew I was not going to be manipulated by their hypocrisy anymore. This person always seemed to filter out their flawed characteristics in personality, as if they were always unaware of things that are hurtful to say or do. This is when I spoke directly towards their actions but they always could easily see fault in others just not themselves. Always saying they never remembered treating me horrible and really, I almost died one night because they were yelling at me drunk because I was driving too slow after a night out in the city, and we were both tipsy but them more so. They kept asking me if I knew what, I was doing and to just let them drive and just listen to them. For the record, I was driving safely, and super hurt by them after a person groped me and they started yelling at me, asking why I didn‚Äôt do anything. They started telling me that‚Äôs why I shouldn‚Äôt wear this and that and really, I was fully clothed no booty shorts or nothing. I was wearing a nice long legged romper with appropriate unrevealing cleavage and even a sweater on top to cover my booty with tights-and short heels! It was a night out and there were other women dressed even more vicariously than me, of what I would consider date night appropriate! To get them to shut up, I did and we ended up going on a one way, the wrong way! It was a long 8 year friendship that ended up really bad on a trip out, it was the worst drive home ever. Friend emotionless, last words were, ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre content with yourself, and I don‚Äôt wish you happiness because I think that‚Äôs cliche.‚Äù Now I don‚Äôt give a fuck but at that point, to hear from someone you cared about. Hit me to the floor. I wished them all the best, happiness and more, I just felt I was always more vulnerable,open,honest, supportive and patient than they as a friend could ever be or WANT to BE. I needed a level of commitment not overbearing but not a superficial friendship either of which they‚Äôre words were that we were ‚ÄúBestfriends‚Äù.  I was only Simone to pass the time and for free outings, I guess because I would willingly pay because they said, ‚ÄúI was their Bestfriend‚Äù. Never supported me in any of my endeavors always played the devils advocate to question my goals and felt like I always had to prove myself to them. They used so many mind fuck games to get me entranced in all this knowledge they had and that I would never understand on my own. It was crazy, wasted nights, wasted years, waste of thought. Honestly you can really want the best for someone, if you are taking a break because your compatibility is tarnished. I don‚Äôt get why people are so cynical. I guess they just don‚Äôt want anything hanging over their shoulders. Maybe they even wanted a bad memory of me so they could justify their abuse.",

Not sure why it completely crushed me emotionally so much so I was emotionally numb and was in zombie mode for a solid week because at that point (I was 24) I already knew what kind of person she was, that she didn't care about me, knew what her response would be and had dealt with her abuse and bullshit for 2+ decades but I guess deep down that innocent child broke out crying for their mom. Side note after that I completely cut off contact with her and haven't had anything to do with her since then, a year later I ended up getting sober and have been clean since then (i'm 30 now). \n\n\"Zebra arm, Zebra arm, Zebra arm!\"- said by my mom as she was laughing. I was 15 at the time and she was making fun of my self harm marks that were on my left arm (fresh ones and old scars) comparing the cut marks to Zebra stripes. \n\n\"No wonder your mom doesn't love you\" - said by my ex best friend during an argument we were having over something trivial. Even though we're no longer friends and haven't talked in 3 years him saying that still hurts me because he knew what I had been through. I'm a champ at hiding my emotions (had to learn pretty early on to suck it up and keep it to myself because of my upbringing) but as soon as those words passed his lips I started crying. \n\nI grew up in an abusive home, was emotionally and physically abused by my mom, she's the bane of my existence, is the root of all my problems, emotionally obliterated me for life and let's just say is the complete opposite of what a good mother is so it's no surprise that all the most horrible things that have been said to me (that I remember because most of it I blocked out) were either said by her or in relation her.

We are \"best friends\" but we've always walked a fine line on that one. She frequently stays with me, or I with her. We sleep in the same bed, usually cuddling/holding hands etc. Have had sex numerous times and are fairly regularly pretty sexual with each other. She finds it fun and somewhat amusing knowing how god damn insanely attracted to her I am. I actually don't think I could create a more attractive person if I could build one from scratch, from my perspective. \n\nWell to shorten the story as much as possible, I thought she had left a guy that she had been with a few days prior to this happening. She came by my house at around 1 A.M. saying she wanted to see me. We had sex, and it was extremely passionate which was not normal. In the past it was entirely physical, this time it was very emotional as well. I love you's, deep eye contact, lots of kissing. All things we hadn't previously done during sex. Well a couple days later this guy called me and said they were in fact together at the time (something she disputes to this day, saying they were on a break) and he knew somehow she was at my house and assumed we had sex. This guy told me that she had said I was \"disgusting\" and she would never ever have sex with me when he asked her about it. She has since apologized saying she only said that to make him feel better and try to avoid the confrontation. He was a pretty fuckin scary dude. Very manipulative, most likely a sociopath, very fragile ego and prone to fighting when he feels insulted. \n\nI've since forgiven her, after all I do love her genuinely. It's a complicated thing between us. She can be very supportive and kind, caring, thoughtful. I know truly that she does care about me, and in fact feels really badly about not feeling for me how I do for her. She broke down crying about it one time. I don't want to paint her out to just be evil and manipulative, she has matured quite a bit since this time. Though I do have a hard time deciding if I'd be better off without her as involved in my life. Every time I've tried putting distance, we've gravitated back to the same place. I know this was a long comment, but I held a lot of the details back honestly. I felt everything I included was essential to paint the picture properly. \n\nTL;DR a woman I love and have a very close relationship with told someone she found me disgusting shortly after we had a night of very strong emotional connection.",
