Don’t trust anyone, not even your own family either. \n\nPeople don’t change.. best case scenario, they just learn how to hide.\n\nYou’re on your own in life. Most people have company for the fear of loneliness, but we’re actually all selfish. We like to call ourselves “relational beings” but I’d rather use the term “selfish, fearful beings”. Try being alone for a week/up to a month. Analyze your feelings and evaluate what your close ones tell you… you’ll see that I’m telling the truth.\n\nLove does not exist; it’s just a word used to express appreciation of someone doing something for us, serving us, or making us feel a certain way. The truest form of love you’ll ever get is that of your mom. Second place, your father, and third your siblings. Not your wife, or sweetheart. Your wife/SO only serve this purpose: to create another form of love after your parents pass away = your kids. She still is capable of cheating no matter how pure she seems, or how much she “loves” you. If you do anything that is against her serving purposes (personal or whatnot) that “love” she had for you ceases to exist. Your mom on the other hand will (most often than not) love you unconditionally. Think of young prisoners.. no one ever visits them, only their mom most likely and if their SO visits them, it’s most often to trash on them or to serve their needs (whether emotional, insecurity, etc.). A mother will visit her prisoner son/daughter because she wants to know how he is, that he is surviving more than she is to visit for the sole purpose of “emotional fulfillment”. You know what I mean? \n\nThe people that truly will win in life are cold people that are self-reliant and don’t care about human ties.",

I'm left with sorry but \"that's going to tear me\" or \"how about just the hand?\". Lots of women talk about size but when it comes to it, most won't do it out of intimidation. It can be a curse or a blessing, depending on who you end up with. I can't just go regardless of how heated the moment is. I always have to hold back and start slow.  One time, this sweet petite fitness trainer challenged me and to make a long story short, she asked me to drive her to the ER to get stitches. I felt so horrible and I paid for her medical bill. We ended up dating for several months but she always hesitated and had to start slow. I could never be the one to take charge because she always wanted to ease herself on. The point being, size is not what it's all hyped up to be. You don't get all the flexibility and the free range that an average size can do. It's more of a curse, don't believe the porn videos!",

Ultimately it all reverts back to the world’s oldest profession, varying with how overt or covert the transaction is amongst different couples. She doesn’t care about you, she cares about what you do for her and what you provide.\n\n2. Monkey branching is par for the course in dating. No man is immune to cuckoldry. By and large a woman will always try to establish a firm hold in a new man before she breaks it off with the prior one. From an evolutionary perspective this makes sense, as in olden hunter-gatherer times women needed to ensure that they had a roof over their head and food in their belly, and one of the easiest ways to do that is to offer themselves to someone willing to share that with them. Fundamentally, humans haven’t yet evolved past that intrinsic psychology. It’s hard-wired into our dna.\n\n3. Ghosting is the new normal. You could be in a heartfelt, loving, cool as a cucumber relationship, everything seems fine, and one day they just drop off the face of the earth. Did they die? Did they find someone else? Was it something you did? You’ll never know. And it’s never going away now.",

            "text": "All the above statements about no-one giving a fuck, sadly true. I feel like I have lived my life working hard, shown respect and had good morals. Was in a relationship for ten years, I have three beautiful girls. I'd made it thirty five years in life with no issues, I ran into a manager at work who's personality and ethics/morals I had not come across in my life. Long story short through a combination of long hours, a toxic work environment and an inability to have a life out of work. I had a breakdown, stress, anxiety & cluster migraines were common and eventually turned into depression. I held on as long as possible, but eventually after six months I quit. As soon as I did it, I felt a shift in my relationship. My ex never worked and I never asked her to work, I was happy for her to be a stay at home mother. I won't go into great detail, but I never felt like she was putting in effort to work as a team, after a sixteen hour day I'd come home and could work another eight just getting the house in order and giving the kids the time they needed. I could go on and on, but what happened eventually is I stopped trying to make everything perfect. I stopped cleaning up after everyone, I stopped taking care of the house inside and out and I stopped asking if she was ok. With the expectation that as soon as work piled up, she might step in and help. No, what happened was she got angry. Angry that the house looked like crap, there were dishes building up, there was laundry building up the place was a mess. \nYou are only as loved & respected as you are willing to work for no matter what other people are doing, I may have chosen a horrendous life partner and mother to my children, that is on me.\nBut after going through all of this, she does the one thing that she has left in her arsenal, the one thing that any woman can do if the argument is going her way.\nAfter a vocal argument about the kids school attendance, an argument that she obviously didn't appreciate. The police show up and after a bit of back and forth, I'm arrested in front of all three of my children.\nWe go to court, she admits to false accusations which makes no difference at all, she gets to keep going with her life.\nShe expects me to come home like nothing ever happened, I do not and find a one bedroom studio until I can get back on my feet.\nShe is bitter I have made this choice, so the last remaining weapon are the children. \nFor six months after we seperated I have simply copped her toxic ba on the chin, just so I could see my children. In that six months based on her mood and behaviour I have probably seen my kids separately and never all together about three days out of six months. The eldest I haven't seen at all due to parental alienation, and I don't expect that relationship to turn around.\nIt is my honest belief now, that you need to take what you want from this world. Be the asshole, and don't try and have good expectations of other people, just look after yourself.\nHaving said that, I'm forty, and I won't be changing who I am now. There is no point, all that I built up in this world, has gone. The only thing that made me feel whole, my children, have been taken and I will never be able to be the parent that I set out to be.\nNot everyone can succeed at life, I fell down to get back and try over and over. While other people are on easy mode and get to experience life in such a beautiful way. It sucks, but it's reality.",

While I lay there in bed, listening to all of that, I thought about all the other friendships I had and realized that most of them shared a similar pattern.\n\nI stopped talking with them and anyone else who treated me that way.

You have to find that for yourself.\n\nBeing able to look at your life and say \"I am content with everything I have\". That is what true success really is.

This results in a more \"me\" mentality. \n\nOfcourse this doesn't apply to everyone but it is something i have seen happen a lot and also happened to me. I used to think that everyone thought about the consequenses of their actions and put others well being above their own if they are in a comfortable position and someone else is not. But 9/10 they Just choose for themselves and try to build their own happy and succesful world.
