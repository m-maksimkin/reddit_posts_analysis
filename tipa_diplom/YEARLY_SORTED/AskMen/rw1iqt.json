Warm, soft, feminine.   And generally you can tell when they step out of that.  Bickering, noncomplianct, cold.   \n\nOne of the things you learn as you age is that masculine and feminine call to each other.  If you want a girl to act like a girl and fill up the feminine domain, you have to properly inhabit the masculine.   \n\nControlled, composed, with a plan.  With other things in your life that are more important than your romantic partner. \n\nGirls will say that they want a guy who is in touch with their emotions and softer and stuff, but you have to be very balanced with that.  \n\nIt’s one thing to be emotionally intelligent or accessible, but if you become emotionally controlled or unsteady, you’re slipping into femininity and breaking the male / female contract.   You’re inviting her to claim space in the masculine control domain.  \n\nIt was a hard lesson to learn for me.  I didn’t understand why some relationships that started so well seemed to lose the heat or pop that made it function so well in the beginning. \n\nGirls would say they wanted to talk or feel emotionally closer, but then it seemed to damage the attraction, even if they said they were grateful with words. \n\nLearn that. \nIf you get too soft, too dopey, too”I love you and only you,” you’re not operating as a man and it’s not good for the relationship.   \n\nOnce you sacrifice your masculine exterior, youve lost the thing that initially made you attractive.  \n\nYou can be a good guy and treat someone well, but if you want to preserve the attraction, you’re better off being slightly too closed, than slightly too open.",

            "text": "It’s not what we do here to impress other people that matters. It’s how we treat other people. Positive minds practice humility. Self worth is honesty within and showing it off to other people, not doing stuff to get noticed. We are all equal socially already. There is no worth to prove. Being level socially is secure and an expression of love. Being competitive  non-stop socially is always fear-based.\n\nHumor in a mind, when authentic, is about sharing emotions (thoughts, ideas, and beliefs) that honor all people. There is no authority here. Serious minds, or minds that laugh but also look down on other people socially, share ideas and beliefs that are cruel and selfish. \n\nWe are all connected within (quantum entanglement). All people are psychically focused and focus on vibe / telepathy. Some people use it as a weapon against others (classism). When human beings present a false image to others socially, which means the outer persona does not match the inner persona, it insults the intelligence & awareness of others. No one likes seeing lying in others about who they are within, when we already know the truth. Lying / acting are both insulting to the intelligence of others.\n\nWe are all equal socially already. No one is on top, no one is on the bottom, and no one has any worth to prove to anyone. No one is an authority figure here. No one has a free pass to judge people more than others. Ideas rooted in social hierarchy are degrading, humiliating, and stupid.\n\nType A/ alphas have low feelings of self worth, mental instability, problems with manipulation / dishonesty, and emotional issues from focusing on classism. Alphas are homophobic and insecure about intelligence / feelings. People that have violence / leadership inside the mind are stupid, full of shit, and anti-psychic. \n\nAlphas take their own feelings of self hate and self loathing (insecurities) out on other people socially, unprovoked, for no good reason at all, and then blame other people for it. It’s an endless authoritarian head game for people that never develop a conscience or sense of right or wrong socially.\n\nQuite often the reasons people judge and cut other individuals down socially without hesitation and incessantly is ONLY because of a competitive nature, not because of a serious threat due to character issues in a person. Cheating in life is knocking people down socially to build up a social life. It’s a bad idea. People see head games in the minds of others. It’s important to be real about this and show honesty socially as much as possible.\n\nWhen people are authentic, they never use career, talent, physical stature / brawn, education, or money as a crutch for self worth socially. There is never a reason to “dominate” others in any area of life when we show or believe in love and friendship. Feelings of self worth come from kindness, honesty, and humility socially, not from social images. Dominators don’t believe in their own personalities or worth. They seek to tear other people down instead.\n\nVery often it’s nice, warm, humble, mature personalities that are already upset and insecure from judgments of the past that are knocked down unfairly even more by status seeking social elitists. People often see gentle human beings as “easy targets” to look down on so that they can attempt to build up their perceived status in an imaginary social hierarchy. Only conformists and shallow cowards think in these terms, not headstrong men and women with honesty, kindness, and respect. \n\nWhen people are unwilling to pass judgments as much as possible and want to remain friendly, level, and sincere socially, it’s not out of weakness. It makes a human being mentally sharp, emotionally strong, and much more mature socially. It’s a threatening attitude to people that show hatred and jealousy (judgments) socially. \n\nJudgements from status seekers usually have little actual substance or anything to do with character issues, violence in a personality, or antisocial, critical personality issues. Judgments from status seekers are hypocritical, shallow, cruel, and unfair. They ultimately cause violence and war.\n\nNo one cares about showboating or showing off. No one accepts or tolerates authority in other people - it just seems that way on the surface. Everyone is a spiritual being that sees through bullshit. The more conceited the mind, the more dishonesty there is in it.\n\nPeople remain competitive only when they care little about working through their own judgments, anger, and character issues with other people socially. People stay competitive because they are afraid, not because they are happy or calm. Being competitive doesn’t make people “better”. It makes people nervous, angry, and depressed. Competitors only feel appreciated for what they look like on the outside and for what they are doing, then attack other people socially because they are in pain over not developing an honest, humble personality.\n\nIt’s time for human beings to wake up and end war and human authority for good. It has no place here. Violence and social elitism is jealousy and anger resulting from the competitive nature of human beings. Human beings that do not believe in love, focus on self worth, have a desire to heal in life, or learn to respect other people socially will always remain competitive, forceful, shallow, dishonest, and aggressive.\n\nAll people appreciate personality, warmth, and humor the most - not what other people do to show off and impress people socially. That is just being real and honest.\n\nWe are all spiritual beings. We are all psychic. Live the truth and heal self and others socially. It is the only way forward. Allowing love is strong and secure. \n\nMen and women either believe in love, or they do not believe in themselves. Endless competitive head games is all rooted in fear and jealousy.",

Know what you like and don’t like. \n\nDon’t get married early. Even if you found your soulmate, just wait, trust me. It’s completely unnecessary to make such a big commitment at such an early age. \n\nPersonally, I would wait to have kids until your about 27, 28. I’m 30 and I’m barely going to start and I’m glad that I did. \n\nYou may have 100 friends right now, by 30 you’ll have 3-5. Don’t waste your time and energy trying to impress them all. With time you’ll know who the real ones are. If you currently have 3-5 real friends now, I bet every dollar I have that it will change by 30 and that’s ok. We all outgrow each other and move toward different paths.\n\nI learned a lot from having a dog in my 20s. If you have the time, space, energy and finances, then adopt from your local shelter. Never shop for a dog.",

Establishing and furthering your career, 3. Finding the girl. The first 2 will make #3 a lot easier.\n\nIf you don't heed that advice, here's what's going to happen to you - and you can set your watch to it as it is a near 100% certainty:\n\n1. You'll wake up one day and you'll be 38. It will happen that quickly. None of your awesome best friends will be around. They will all be raising families. When you're 20, you have 40 best friends. When you're 30 you'll have 25 best friends. When you're 35 you'll have 10. When you're 45 you'll have about 2 or 3 if you're lucky. Over the age of about 35, no one has the time or energy for fun and games. So fuck your friends. They're not really your friends, anyway. They're drinking buddies at best. You just think they're your friends. It's all a simulation and a self delusion. 'But, but, Dave is the funniest guy I know. I trust him, I tell him all my stuff, he knows everything about me. We double date every weekend.' Trust me: 20 years from now, someone will bring up Dave's name and it won't even ring a bell. Trust me on this.\n2. If you haven't firmly established and built your career before your early 30's, you are simply not a good mate, which leads to the next point.\n3. All the best, most honest, wholesome, stable girls from good families with education and money will have already gotten married and you'll be drafting in the 4th round. Once you get to be 38, the only girls left are the ones that are problematic. Before the ladies beat me up for saying that, it's probably the same for them the other way around.\n\nIn the meantime, go out and get a nice car but not too nice. You need the money for other things and you don't want girls liking you just because you have a nice car. Just as important, get some nice furniture, cookware, towels and bedroom set for your apartment. You don't have to break the bank if you do it right. Ikea, Amazon, and the local furniture outlets are your friends. Women notice that and you get instant respect.",

If you didn't follow this in highschool, then make sure you do in college because you can fix it by getting into a better grad school.\n\n2. Networking matters more than education. You need those good grades to get to a good school where networking actually matters and will help you in the long run.\n\n3. Use that network to get internships before you graduate. It's work experience and expands your network to actual professionals who have seen your potential and can vouch for you beyond a conversation over a cup of coffee.\n\n4. Start putting some thought into how you dress. Take a girl that is into you shopping and have her point out what looks good on you. Dress in clothes that fit you and complement your features. Light skin? Stay away from light colors. Dark skin? Lighter colors are your friend. Get at least one suit (Navy, Charcoal, or Grey) and get it tailored to fit you. Stop in at a store and ask someone to get you fitted with something. Don't order online. How it fits and looks is more important than how expensive it is. First impressions matter immensely and clothing plays a huge part in that.\n\n5. Use all this to land a decent career that pays well or will eventually pay well.\n\n6. Cut out people that will only hold you back or act as a negative influence on your life. It'll be like crabs in a bucket and they'll prevent you from reaching your full potential. Edit: To clarify, these are people constantly telling you you're never going to be able to do something, or are getting into harder drugs, or are getting into bar fights consistently etc. The company you keep is important. Use your judgment. \n\n7. Eat as healthy as you can and do some lifting at least a few times a week. If you're not gaining weight and packing on muscle, you're not eating enough. While your friends are pulling their shoulders and throwing out their backs in their 30's, you'll be feeling great and looking great.\n\n8. Pick up a martial arts. Something practical. I don't care what anyone says, size matters so lifting will help make you bigger and a more effective fighter. Ideally you'll never need to use it but the confidence that comes from knowing how to fight has gotten me out of more fights than I can count. \n\n9. Don't let dating get you down or put too much stock in finding \"the one.\" Everyone is still figuring themselves out in their 20's. Women are still at their most popular while you're just getting started. If you've listened to the above steps, women will start chasing you and your thirties are going to be a blast. A guys thirties are like a girls twenties. Remember that and be patient.\n\n10. Find time for your parents. Give them a call. Visit them. Ask about their life or for advice. Let them know you appreciate them. In your thirties they'll start greying and looking older. They'll start running into health issues. Don't let them pass away as strangers.

It’ll happen when it happens. \n\nIf you don’t go to college, you’ll be fine. Might it help? Probably. But will your life be a million times better? That’s debatable. \n\nSave your money. Sure, you can go out once in a while and treat yourself to something nice.

Yeah, I know I know that letting go is easier said than done, but work towards not holding onto anger. Again, I learned this the hard way. \n\nDon’t fuck with drugs. Sure, you could smoke a doobie at the end of your day, once you’ve kicked ass and owned the day, but keep it at that. Don’t fuck with coke, heroin, speed or anything else that is illegal. \n\nDon’t drink and drive. Just don’t.

Use time to do nothing on purpose.\n\nLife got great as I was leaving my 20s and entering my 30s. But great was also busy.\n\nValue your time. Think \"how long would it take to do that and is it worth my time\" and if it isn't  than don't do it. Say no. Hire a professional. Ask for help from a friend.\n\nSleep enough. Rest. Recover. Stretch and exercise. My 30s have been fine so far but I'm looking up ahead at those in their 40s. It is easy to get tired and stay tired. Get hurt and stay hurt. We start to rebound slower now.\n\nFocus on your community. It's great to think and worry about the world's problems. And it is good to care. But you have the ability to impact your community in real ways. Sign up as a Precinct Committee Officer for your local party. Show up to town hall meetings and the planning commission hearings. Caucus and vote and get to know your mayor and city council. The people who show up are the ones with a voice; and in most places not many show up.\n\nSave for retirement. If you're turning 30 it isn't too late to start and still be effective. Once you're 40 you're really running out of time. Get that Roth IRA, 401k, gold and silver stacking, life insurance, whatever you can afford... a little bit now will snowball by the time you're 60. Which you are halfway to. You're halfway to 60. That's old people territory. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nHave a plan for retirement and old age. An end goal. Focusing on wealth is an infinitely scaling game that can never be won. Having an exit plan gives you something to work towards. I've got one friend who is working towards owning a hobby shop. Another who wants to have a pizza hole and sell it by the slice. I'm working on trying to build a literal community where I live so I can keep those I care for close to me. Another is working on designs for a self sustaining farm that takes less than 2 acres. Some of these may never actually happen but it gives us hope and goals and something explicit to work towards.\n\nAnd finally; [if it makes you happy nurture it in your life.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fev02vMyF8A)",

Take things slow if you want it to be serious and if it seems like it is going to turn into something long-term, then starting investing more into it. I spent most of my 20s (and a ton of my money) with people who I wound up not staying with. One of my major regrets is investing so much into these other people when I should have invested it into myself. \n\n-Develop good money management skills, a savings plan, and a good health routine. The younger you you these the better off you will be in the long run. Also, invest. \n\n-Plan for the future but don't forget to enjoy the present. I kind of coasted through my 20s without ever really planning for my future, I always thought it would just kind of work out since I had the degree I wanted. I'd get there eventually, when I was 30 everything would have worked itself out. I'm now 31 and realizing the things I want likely won't work out until I'm near 40 because I didn't properly plan and set goals. \n\n-Explore. Go see the world and experience things while you are still young and energetic. I'm getting more into traveling in my 30s than I ever did in my 20s and I regret the time I missed that I could have been doing this. \n\n-Take risks. Take that job that requires you to move out of state/region. Save up and quit that shitty job to go travel. Invest in that thing you think may take off. Risky moves like this are super easy to recover from when you're in your 20s, not so much as you continue to get older. \n\n-Really have a deep think on what trajectory you want your life to go. You don't have to have it all lined up but just try to feel out what you want your life to be when your 30 or 40 or 50 so you know what to work towards and can start earlier rather than later. Want kids? Want to own a home? Want to get married? Be a vagabond and travel the world? Live in a different country? Just try to really think what will suit you so you can start planning and preparing for it. \n\n-Above all else, find out who you are. Try new things. Learn your dislikes and likes. Don't worry about what other people think about you, just really be true to yourself and begin to understand who you really are. This is the time for it and your life gets so much easier once you have that locked down.",

It is a masterclass in owning a mistake. \n\nBut there is a lot of confusion as to what abuse is and is not. The word abuse is losing it’s meaning so I have collected a glossary so we can use actual terms to describe what abuse looks like. So when you see it, you can name it and call it out. \n\nMost importantly this is what I use to avoid creating victims. \n\nPrinciples of Consent and glossary \n\nPrinciple 1. In a sexual/ romantic relationship you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do; you don’t owe anyone anything. Ever. \n\nThis is also your new attitude towards your partner. They don’t owe you sex or love. They can leave anytime. You say this through your actions. It is not an excuse to neglect your relationships. You must set boundaries and you must respect boundaries. You are still responsible for your actions or inactions.\n\n\nPrinciple 2. Prescribed Relationship: any relationship which begins in a professional or any other context in which an imbalance of power exists.  e.g. your doctor, teacher, student, patient, coworker, boss, employee, bar tender, waitress, star of your movie, people who are not conscious, underage people, etc.\n\nTo use a professional relationship or position of power to locate, identify, coerce, force, or manipulate someone into a personal/sexual relationship is abuse.\n\nPrinciple 3. ~~Rape, love bombing, negging, gaslighting, forced teaming, doxing, playing the victim, isolation, intimidation, financial abuse, triangulation, gifts with strings attached, cat calling, physical violence, blackmailing, sexual identity outing, blaming the victim, stealthing, stalking, smear campaigns, dick pics, revenge porn, hoovering, malicious tardiness, sea lioning, and control are abuse.\n\nEDIT:\n\nPrinciples of Consent Glossary \n\nRape- unlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against a person's will or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent because of mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconsciousness, or deception\n\nLove bombing- an attempt to influence a person by demonstrations of attention and affection. It can be used in different ways and for either positive or negative purposes. \n\nnegging and insulting- an act of emotional manipulation whereby a person makes a deliberate backhanded compliment, otherwise flirtatious remark, *or even insults* another person to undermine their confidence and increase their need of the manipulator's approval.\n\ngaslighting- forcing others to believe or act as though they believe a lie through subtle, verbal, emotional, and physical manipulation and even abusive verbal, emotional, physical punishment, and violence. \n\nYou okay know when you call someone out and they pretend they didn’t hear you? Or they act like they don’t remember what you’re talking about. Remember stealing a little bit of liquor from your parents and using water to make the bottle look just as full again? Or it could be as serious as forging someone’s signature on a last will and testament. The thing is that gaslighting doesn’t stop with these kind of infractions. It encompasses their entire identity and any little moment can be a call to verbal arms in order to push the narrative. Every moment every day for everything they’re insecure about until you think you’re crazy. \n\nhttps://www.northpointrecovery.com/blog/gaslighting-examples-effects-confront-abuse/\n\nE.g. “Anytime I stood up for myself he would say that he wouldn’t yell at me or call me names if I didn’t act so stupid, or if I didn’t behave a certain way. He would even say that my actions had consequences and reactions. Constantly made me feel like a child that was being punished.”\n\nforced teaming- This is when a person implies that they have something in common with their chosen victim, acting as if they have a shared predicament when that isn't really true. Speaking in \"we\" terms is a mark of this, i.e. \"We don't need to talk outside... Let's go in.\" \n\ndoxing- publicly publishing private personally identifying information, contact information, addresses, or location. \n\nplaying the victim- using victim hood to excuse abusive behavior \n\nisolation- using any means to keep an abuse victim away from friends and family. e.g. taking their phone, keeping them from going out alone \n\nintimidation- threats of harm to self or others. \n\ngifts with strings attached/Loan sharking- unsolicited help to the chosen victim and anticipating they'll feel obliged to extend some reciprocal openness in return.\n\nfinancial abuse- using money as a means of control a victim. Or using control as a means to extract money from a victim. \n\ntriangulation- using a third party to specifically incite jealousy and to devalue the intended victim\n\ncat calling- a loud, sexually suggestive call or comment directed at someone publicly\n\nphysical violence- physically stopping someone from leaving, holding someone down, pushing, hitting, kicking, slapping, punching, choking, cutting, stabbing, raping, stomping, shooting, throwing acid, hanging/lynching, setting on fire, throwing boiling water, dragging behind vehicles, drowning, causing any bodily harm, serious bodily harm or death. \n\nblackmailing-demand money or another benefit from (someone) in return for not revealing compromising or damaging information about them. \n\nsexual identity outing- telling people that others are LGBT when they aren’t ready to come out. \n\nblaming the victim- occurs when the victim of a crime or any wrongful act is held entirely or partially at fault for the harm that befell them.\n\nstealthing- faking the use of prophylactics. Removing a condom durning sex. Coming inside when you are supposed to pull out. \n\nstalking- willful and repeated following, watching or harassing of another person\n\nsmear campaigns- an effort to damage or call into question someone's reputation, by propounding negative propaganda\n\ndick pics- illegally digitally exposing yourself without consent \n\nrevenge porn- the distribution of sexually explicit images or videos of individuals without their consent. The sexually explicit images or video may be made by a partner in an intimate relationship with the knowledge and consent of the subject at the time, or it may be made without their knowledge \n\nhoovering- any attempt to regain contact with someone who has explicitly cut off contact \n\nSea Lioning- where you repeatedly badger someone with questions or requests for evidence in bad faith\n\nDestruction of property- destroying makeup/cosmetics, bleaching clothes, burning items, throwing plates or glass, keying cars, punching walls \n\ncontrol- an act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim.\nThis controlling behaviour is designed to make a person dependent by isolating them from support, exploiting them, depriving them of independence and regulating their everyday behaviour. \n\nIsolating you from friends and family. Depriving you of basic needs, such as food. Monitoring your time. Monitoring you via online communication tools or spyware. Taking control over aspects of your everyday life, such as where you can go, who you can see, what you can wear and when you can sleep. Depriving you access to support services, such as medical services. Repeatedly putting you down, such as saying you’re worthless. Humiliating, degrading or dehumanising you. Controlling your finances. Making threats or intimidating you.",

That they need all of these outside validations in order to feel like “a man”. A lot of men stress themselves out trying to seek validation that is fleeting. They will work endless hours to get a high paying career with a good job title just to be miserable going to work every day. They will stay with women who treat them poorly or use them just because they look good on their arm. They will spend hours in the gym perfecting their body to look tough & superior. I’m not saying all men, but most men are persuaded into doing these things to be accepted by society. \n\nSo my advice for men is to figure out what feeling you want out of this life. And gear your life towards that. If you want to have fun, find a job will allow you to live an eventful life (where you can actually enjoy life). If your idea of happiness is to be a stay at home dad, find a partner that can support that lifestyle for you. Who cares what other people think? If they judge, they’re either miserable or fail to understand not everyone needs to live what their idea of a “good life” is. \n\nIn shorter terms.. life is short. Don’t stress yourself out trying to have it all. And stop seeking approval from others.",

Stay at home as long as you can, if it’s already too late, live with friends. The entire time, save your money. Don’t get a huge fancy apartment or fill your place with expensive things. Live frugal, save, and shut the fuck up about it to keep people from asking you for money.\n\n3. Buy less house than you can afford. Don’t listen to realtors or brokers trying to talk you into expensive neighborhoods or big houses. Your first house is like your first car, it’s going to be a learning experience. Don’t skimp on the inspection, walk with the inspector and ask questions like ‘when will that need to be replaced?’ And ‘if this was your house, what would you worry about?’ Also, remember that furniture and supplies is basically going to be an extra mortgage payment for that first month or so. Similarly, plan for the move in/purchase. Shop shop shop. Check out Black Friday or other big sales events regardless of your closing/move in date. These big places keep stuff in warehouses waiting for delivery, there is no cost for you to buy it and set the delivery date 6-12 months out. Find the best deals or interest free promos.\n\n4. Speaking of interest, guard your credit like the last parachute on a plane with engine problems. Don’t ever, ever, ever cosign for anyone or loan money to people unless you don’t plan on ever seeing that money again. 999/1000 times, someone with bad credit got themselves into that position, and will be just as eager to do it to you too. Having good credit can take hundreds of dollars off your monthly mortgage payment.\n\n5. On the heels of credit and living frugally, keep that lifestyle even if you get a higher income. Don’t buy brand new cars unless you pay cash. Whatever you finance, take the shortest term possible and pay it off in half the time. Interest is money down the drain. On cars, don’t even consider anything longer than a 48 month term. The sweet spot for cars is to find a year or two old vehicle with less than 20k miles for that $10k range. It will still have plenty of warranty and you’ll have a $250 payment. For mortgage, dump any extra money you can into it. Make weekly payments to hack away at that balance, but make at least 13 monthly payments in a year, it will save you tens of thousands of dollars in the long run. Remember, if you are thinking of buying something and the price/payment of it won’t allow you to make extra payments to pay it off sooner, you can’t afford it. That mindset will save you so much stress.\n\n6. Lastly, love. Don’t rush it. Don’t go looking for it. Live your life, be the best person you can be. You’ll probably have flings and bumps and even heartbreak. Don’t let any of that get you down. How others treat you is a reflection on them, not you. Find someone you don’t have to change to be with, and be open and honest with them. Once you know they are the one, everything changes and it’s no longer you against the world, it’s you plus them. \n\n7. Honorable mention: fuck anyone that is in your way. Friends, family, strangers, anyone that treats you like garbage or otherwise tries to hold you back or bring you down. Cut them out of your life and move on. Don’t fight, don’t post on Facebook, just leave. Life is too short to be stuck with people that don’t appreciate you. Everyone is the main character of their own story, don’t be an extra for someone else’s daytime drama. Be the star of your own blockbuster movie.",

A lot of us feel like our 20s should be the peak of our life but we're really lacking in many skills and putting some time into learning those and improving ourselves really pays dividends in the future.\n\nFollowing to this, without sounding too sexist, women generally are gonna be reaching their peak of desirability in their 20s (though this is changing) wheras we feel we should be too but realistically it's more like our 30s and 40s that men's attractiveness is peaking. It takes time to figure out how to dress, gaining muscle and how to get lean (especially when balancing putting time into education, careers, hobbies ext). It also takes time to improve financial stability.\n\nAll of which will go a long way to improving your attractiveness to others in society.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost importantly though, I feel there are so many expectations of young men in society and we're generally bad at expressing our feelings to each other. There's an expectation of having it 'all figured out' in our early 20s and this I feel is so unhelpful.\n\nAlmost no guys have it all figured out in their 20s (let alone any age) and those that think they do, most likely have even less figured out. There's so much we need to learn and putting these pressures on ourselves is not helpful.\n\nIt's better to have more of a growth mindset and enjoying the progress over comparing others and focusing on what we don't have.\n\nBe kind to yourself!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that helps some people!",

When it comes to finance, figure out a budget and stick to it. Get out and stay out of debt. Also if you're able to, learn about two things in regard to investing, growth and dividends. invest in both of them with a passion. 1 in 10 people who do get rich quick actually get rich and you are not the 1. This isnt a dis towards women but all people are aweful and women are people. Dont rush it, make sure she wants the same things out of life and has similar values. Ex: If u are family centered make sure she is, if you are career focused make sure she is. And dont think for a moment she cant fall out of love for u. 8 years together with 2 deployments apart i came back from my second with 6 months left in my contract and then boom she was gone the day i came back. Never would have thought it was possible. Up and left is a story too many men can tell. So if you do get married get a prenup. Like i said its not a dis towards women but people are greedy selfish things. And pay attention to a persons ACTIONS above all else. Words are meaningless.

If you have a friend who is into something you know how much they light up when they talk about it. Passion (and the search for it) will take you to amazing places and open opportunities that weren't previously possible. It's changed my life entirely.\n\n       ^Pro tip: be mindful when monetizing your passion. Doing something for fun that is entirely in your control is much different than trading that control for money. Learned this the hard way. It can zap the love you had for something at times. Be sure to do projects for yourself to keep the balance.\n\n-Don't be afraid to be outside your comfort zone. More cool shit happens here  in an hour than in a week of your normal routine. Trying something new like a sport or hobby for the first time isn't exclusive to children, oftentimes people think they're too old to do something for the first time as an adult. \n\n- Be genuinely grateful. It's 100% okay to strive for more, but letting it control your mindset (and ultimately your life) will overshadow what you already have. Focusing on the negative is parasitic to happiness.\n\n-Realizing the one thing you always have full control of is your attitude. This one is leaps and bounds harder than the rest, it comes with practice and practice alone. You'll learn a lot about yourself..\n\n- The time is now. Always be aware of your situation and how to get the most out of it. Realize that not taking time to persue your dreams and goals is the perfect recipe for a future midlife crisis. Corvettes are cool and all, but telling your grandkids that you sold everything you own to travel the world could make for better bedtime stories. \n\n-Relationships are the result of the energy you put into them. Don't expect more from someone you couldn't be bothered to be there for when they needed you. Investments here have exponential gains.\n\n\n\nTLDR; drank a few.",

This doesn't mean they aren't responsible, just not malicious.\n\n'You are not obligated to family or friends' - There are some people that do not deserve your unconditional love or support.

No need to beat yourself over the head with it every day. That’ll just stunt your growth.\n\nMake as much money as you can and learn how to trade stocks. Tech has made it so you can learn and trade in the comfort of your bed. You have the power and capability to change your life. You will have to learn the hard way and that won’t be free. You will lose money. You will not get rich quick. BUT if you spend your early 20s working your ass off and are fortunate enough to live rent free at your parents you owe it to yourself to spend as much time investing so you have the knowledge to see an opportunity and the capability to act on it. You can make hundreds of thousands of dollars with a click of a button. You just have to know where the button is how to click it and when to click it. Soon you won’t have the opportunity to fail as many times as you need to. Youll be working paycheck to paycheck and won’t be able to afford the risk. ESPECIALLY if you have a gf/wife… I would  suggest not dating and saving as much as you can. The idea is to not lose money so Start out with paper money. Every brokerage app has a fake paper money option it’s the same interface same stocks same everything except your using fake money to make your mistakes. While you’re doing that and getting the hang of it build up your cash reserve. After months of researching, reading what others are thinking, learning the user interface, controls, stock lingo and everything under the sun you will have gained the knowledge and experience. Then the time will come for you to strike and you’ll have that cash in hand. Don’t invest all of it. Ease in. \n\nI spent 2 years teaching myself how it all works. Looked into businesses and markets. Had no idea what to look for I just kept looking. No one even told me what I just told you. I made over 100k last year…because I was ready. And prepared. That is ALL SUCCESS IS.\n\nThat and having the right mindset. If you believe you will be rich. Truly believe. Tell yourself every day when you wake up and when you fall asleep you will make moves that will get you there. You will be rich. If you think your a failure and constantly shut yourself down at every chance you get to be happy you’ll be a failure. Simple as that. You are what you tell yourself you are. If your not the person you want to be then get your mind right and *think* like you’re that person and one day you’ll wake up that person. It’s not a half ass idea. You have to go all in and that doesn’t mean telling everyone your something your not. You can’t get what you need from the acceptance of others.",

Be open minded about meeting potential dating partners that maybe don’t seem like your “typical type” right off the bat.\n\nDon’t be uncomfortably blunt, but be honest. Tell people what you are looking for, what traits/characteristics are important to you, and don’t just try to impress people.  Give people a real opportunity to meet YOU. \n\nDon’t ignore red flags. Don’t see people for who you want them to be, but rather who they really are. Don’t try to fix people. Don’t judge people for being who THEY are. Appreciate their honesty, and move on if it’s not for you. A break-up isn’t a failure. It’s giving yourself an opportunity to find what it is you really want rather than remaining stuck in neutral… Or “stuck“ at all.  and don’t fear rejection. If you like someone and I tell you, “sorry, it’s just not gonna work between us“, that person just did you a huge favor!  You just saved yourself months and months of wasted time👍\n\nSorry that my advice is all about relationships, but that’s where my head is these days.   Be confident about “who you are“. Be proud of yourself, but never mistake confidence for cockiness. There is a huge difference.  If you’ve gotten to know a prospective dating partner that you think has potential, let then know your wants, needs, and desires. Find out if they will share the same with you. If they are embarrassed or scared of rejection / judgment, that is a red flag that you need to be very aware of.  Avoid “one-sided relationships“ nobody respects a lapdog. When you truly fall in love with somebody, making them happy is your reward. I remember a relationship, not too far ago, where we both shared one very obvious characteristic! I was fixated on her happiness. And she was fixated on HER happiness😂.  It took me a while to realize that SOMEONE was getting left out of that equation🤔\n\nNever, ever find yourself in one of those relationships where people use a “credit/debit system”. “If you do this for me, I would consider doing this for you.”  Find someone that can’t wait to do “that“ for you because they know it makes you happy. I think that’s enough life lessons for one reply. Oh, I don’t smoke a bunch of pot before replying to Reddit posts. One can have a tendency to get a tad wordy, believe it or not🤷🏼‍♂️.

Don't buy into the hype. Eat healthy, buy a juicer and start juicing and adding healthy supplements. I juice daily, adding several supplements to the juice. i.e. Maca, Artichoke, Garlic, Nettles, Echinacea, Ashwagandha, Turmeric, Hawthorn Ginger. \nBe proud of your image without being vain.

Staying with one company is not an effective way of increasing wages, like back in the good old days. The trick is to constantly be shopping around for the next best thing. You won't have to settle for a below inflation rate annual raise. I would also tell my 20s self to go on more trips.

Be able to talk to someone about your problems, no matter how mundane. Dedicate just a little time to walking, swimming, hiking - whatever interests you. \n\n2) Don't dedicate yourself to a job or company. You don't be there in 5 years. Learn as much as you can about your field, earn certificates. Don't put yourself in debt to do so though. Leverage knowledge and experience at every new job interview. In some cases, research and Ad-lib if you need to.\n\n3) Dont worry about owning and buying fancy things to appeal to people you who have a romantic interest in. Object oriented people will only see the brand, and not you. Focus on making yourself the brand. \n\n4) Do not lend money you can't afford to lose. That means to friends, family, an SO. Anyone. The 1,000 you loan a friend, never to see again, could easily be 1,000 you could put into an investment vehicle of your choosing to see with relatively large gains later down the road.\n\n5) Start putting money into retirement accounts, savings accounts as soon as possible. Compound interest is a wonderful thing.\n\n6) Don't eat lazy food. Do you know how many YouTube videos exist that could teach you how to make simple and delicious meals better than the Big Mac you got before reading this? Millions.\n\n7) Spend time and talk with your parents. They're going to be gone one day. And you will never realize that you could have used the benefit (or detriment) of their experience to shape your outlook on life.\n\n8) Don't fuck hot crazy people. It's not worth it. \n\n9) Be able to forgive yourself as time moves forward. We all have 20/20 hindsight. For some, it can end up being a cycle of regret. Don't fall into the \"what if\" cycle. You can't change the past. But you can definitely change your future.\n\n10) When life fucks you (it will happen in varying degrees) you can choose to sulk, or you can choose to problem solve.

Improve diet & exercise (something I should be doing more myself tbf)\nThe most attractive you is the best version of yourself. \n\n3. Make sure you are financially literate. Know how to save, spend wisely, use Cashback credit cards only when you can pay off the balance in full each week, and know how to save up for something major, like #4. \n\n4. Travel! At least once solo. Extra bonus if it's in a foreign country. If it's your first time, you can go to a country that speaks English or somewhere in western Europe (English literacy is high there).

            "text": "I'm figuring this out still and I am turning 30 in a few weeks as I stumbled through to a point of success that I think is not typically achieved by people like me.\n\n1) work hard\n2) have faith\n3) keep yourself in mind, and before all else going on\n4) learn to recognize sunk cost fallacy\n5) people don't remember your failure as much as they will remember your graceful recovery or withdrawal.\n\nPeople who claim hard work isn't rewarded either don't work hard or have had experiences with bad people. Work hard and keep yourself in mind, and have faith when it gets tough that you will be rewarded.\n\nI lose faith often, and that effects me working hard and then subsequently not keeping myself my own priority. Don't do this.\n\nRecognize when things aren't working or aren't what you thought, and leave or withdraw gracefully.\n\nNow the stuff that gets repeated most in these posts:\n\n1) keep one thing during your day that you can do consistently. Be it working out, meditating, yoga  reading, prayer or whatever. Do it daily and ideally at a certain time of day. Force yourself to do it. Doesn't matter what it is. Make it non negotiable. Why? It gives you that immovable time in your day when you know you will be busy  and you start organizing you'd day around it. This leads to generating a routine  even when you don't try. \n2) sleep is touchy. I personally can't sleep more than 4-5 hours and I am biphasic. So I sleep 5 hours then another 3-4 hours to get 8 with one 2 to 3 hour window in between. I wouldn't say the generic \"get 8 hours\" because the truth is that isn't for everyone. The truth is learn, and I mean invest in this monetarily if needed, but figure out your sleep hygiene, cycle, your dos and don't. When to drink caffeine, when to not rely on caffeine in the morning. Learn your sleep as much as possible, and master it. Make your bed your retrieve where you don't do anything other than forget that the world exists. Make it your corner to do nothing but spend time.\n3) develop and identify your work habits. Are you really someone who can say \"I will do it tomorrow\" and actually do it? Are you someone that spends more than 19 minutes on something that should take less than 9? Are you someone who does well when others fail? Identify those key situations and learn to recognize the patterns that bring on those specific circumstances of your success and failure. Be it something small as meeting a deadline early, or \nDoing something last minute and getting the highest grade or review  in your class/team/job/ whatever. Learn to recognize when you thrive and try to reconstruct those situations on a daily basis. \n\nLastly, absorb everything related to what you choose as the field you want to work in. I started pre med, then pre law, then speech language pathology  and then finally accounting. I am lucky I can move around and do things differently because of my intial aptitude and hard work mentality, that I lose and regain and then lose often. \n\nIt's tough and I wish I had certain mindsets now that I didn't before.",

Be gentle with it at first, don’t be ramming your uncut finger nails inside her from the get go.  \n\nMake her aware and f your needs and always be attentive to yours.   If she’s not interested in hearing your needs? Ditch the bitch with class.  Never with anger. \n\nNever be above reproach.  Be confident af but if someone says something, don’t dismiss it.  Say you’ll think about it or give a complimentary reason why it won’t work.  \n\nWork out 20 min a day.  That’s it.   You don’t have to do more.  Start now.  \n\nListen to people.   Spend 10% talking and 90% listening.  I promise you’ll learn so much about the people around you. \n\nDress well.  Take care of yourself.  Floss, brush your teeth and oil your beard.  Take care of yourself.  \n\nShower often.  Girls won’t go down if your sweaty and smell like shit \n\nDon’t fart in the room.  \n\nDo something for her and her mom.  Show respect to her parents and you’ll thank me after.  \n\nStay off your phone In the company of a girl you like.  Put it away.  \n\nNever be afraid to say I don’t know.  Having said that, never give up till you do.   \n\nAlways treat everyone with respect and kindness.  Even if they’re mouth breathing dick weeds.  Yes, this is insanely hard sometimes. No reason to react unless your lady or your friend is being targeted with violence.   It’s so easy to diffuse situations and you don’t have to wear diapers for the rest of your life.  \n\nLearn how to make a good breaky, wash the toilet and do the dishes.  \n\nIf you really like a girl, tell her why.  Shut up mostly but tell her why she’s the one you want.  Shutting up keeps your dick from talking to loud.   \n\nAsk your gal questions as much as possible.  You need to know why she does what she does and don’t do it with judgement.  Be open and curious.  \n\nBeing kind and confident is the sexiest thing most woman will value. \n\nBe able to laugh at yourself.  Don’t take yourself seriously.  Most social difficulties can be mastered by a good nature, a healthy self image and a good sense of humour.",

Well because till 25 you will have a lot of energy and will be enthusiastic about everything, your body is ready for everything. Then after 26 it's good to start behaving like a responsible person, since you are supossed to be one, your body will start to decrease performance to good eating habits and exercise will keep you fresh. You need an SO because life is cheaper if you share, and really expensive if you are alone. Also most of your groups of friends will have a stable relationship and probably marry and kids, so you need someone to keep going to places, or discovering new things. Because doing it alone is way more boring, you may meet people if you do things alone, but most of them are broken telling you how good their life is alone and how they are woke, maybe not straight forward telling you, but with their attitude.\n\nAlso at your 26-27, you are ok to get some compromises, and if you live all you can and/or want before that age, you already know how people work and how couples work, so you won't be prone to cheat of try new things.

Been a war correspondent, father, Ivy League student, poor community college student, became a single dad, saw my brother destroy himself in a motorcycle accident. All in my 20s. So I can take a fair shot.  \n\n\n\\- Educate yourself: Not just classroom, and not just in the shop. Both. With your brains and with your hands, in the classroom and on your own. Read. Get smart. Your brain is much be able to grasp and appreciate and see. Everything from K-12 was just baseline. Now, you do you. Soak it up. When you find your Thing, or think you're close, learn more, dig more.  \n\n\n\\- Expose yourself: No, not in your bathrobe. Expose yourself to things you've always wanted to try. Expose yourself to people and places you wouldn't expect to encounter. Try different clubs and hobbies. Drive to the country and help farmer for half a day. Drive to the city and check out the buildings, have lunch. You are trying lives on for sizes. Your job is to experience as much as possible.\n\n\\- Work hard: Do you what you must, if you must. If your life is already directed toward medicine or law or welding or whatever, then pursue it, with vigor. If growing money is key, find the best benefits package you can. Look for the best 401K match and USE it. It's like getting free money from your employer. Throw as much as you possible can over your shoulder and into the investment account. Keep enough to fun your adventures. But save. The power of compound interest will be utilizing the money you save in your 20s to make you a millionaire in your 60s. But you must start in your 20s, with focus.  \n\n\n\\- Travel: See \"expose yourself.\" Get your ass away from home. If you're from Timbuktu, get to NYC or LA or Chicago. Visit friends, sleep on couches, get a summer job, or hell, work there for a year. See how the other half lives. Get to another country: backpacking in Spain, biking through Germany. Speak other languages, eat their food, observe how they work and live and play and pray.  \n\n\n\\- Get in the habit of staying fit, eating right, sleeping right. No, in your 20s, you can get away with fucking all of these things up. But when your body rebels in your 30s or 40s, the best path to success is doing those things. If you've been doing them in your 20s, carrying forward into your 30s and 40s and 50s and beyond will be easy. Don't be me. I wait til I was 46 to quit drinking and get all my numbers in shape. Now I'm in the best shape of my life. Period.  \n\n\n\\- Ask big questions. Are we alone? What happens when we die? What will I want to look back on and be known for after I die? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? And then, listen. Trust. Follow. Be good to yourself, be good to other people. Keep yourself   \n\n\nIf I could do my 20s again, this is what I'd focus on. Your first 20 years, your parents begin to do some of these things for you. Most parents my age didn't do it very well for their kids, but regardless -- once you're in your 20s, it is YOUR responsibility. It's YOUR life.   \n\n\nHave fun. Work hard. Be kind.\n\nI hope you find a little value here.",

Even if your primary care doctor doesn't think anything of it check with your friends or family and see if it's the same for them too.\n\nSo much shit that I just assumed everyone dealt with and was just a normal part of life, that I ignored for ages, that I could have looked unto addressing years or decades ago.\n\nPotentially related, actually consider seeing a therapist. You don't have to be completely depressed and incapable of functioning to go talk to someone. It's also nothing to be ashamed about to actually go and talk to someone. Hell I don't care if you think it's bogus and don't really feel like it'd make a difference, giving it a chance isn't going to hurt you. Even just being able to vent and have someone that can help you understand that venting and why you feel the way you do can be a huge game changer.\n\nIn my case I have extreme anxiety and major depression, but the thing is I likely always had both most of my whole life. I just assumed everyone hated school. I assumed everyone constantly felt like they had countless voices in their head arguing back and forth over every detail for everything. I assumed everyone constantly worried about what everyone around them was thinking about them, that their minds were constantly racing through all different scenarios for how they would react.\n\nNone of this was a problem for me \"succeeding\" in school because I could still do tests and such anyway. The moment I went to college though everything fell apart as soon as I had to push myself ever so slightly more. I didn't know what was wrong though. Over 10 years later and I'm still working on figuring out the specifics of all these things I just assumed was normal. If I was just willing to ask questions and talk about these things way back then I could have made so much more progress ages ago.\n\nDon't lie to yourself and don't just avoid telling people what is wrong if they ask and are trying to help. It took me far too many years of therapy before I was able to admit to myself AND my therapist many of the things I knew I was doing and undermining myself. Problems I refused to admit were problems. People asking what's wrong and just saying nothing when it's really not nothing. This WILL make people upset at times. You will hurt people's feelings if you admit something they are doing is bothering you or such. Do it anyway. It's so much better to get that out there and work to improve things because otherwise it just gets worse until you reach a breaking point.\n\nGet your sleep in order. Get on a schedule and keep on it. It's really tempting and really easy to get your sleep entirely fucked but it will destroy your life and be almost impossible to fix if you don't put 1000% effort into it. Case and point it's 6am as I type this. My sleep is shit and it literally destroys the rest of my life.\n\nRelated to sleep, buy a good mattress, a good bed frame and a good pillow. Don't cut costs and get something cheaper. A good night's sleep is worth so much more than you can even understand. Gimmicky shit that helps with your sleep? Consider trying it. A weighted blanket and weighed face mask literally completely changed the game for me in terms of comfort going to sleep. The same might not work for you though, but keep an open mind and find what works for you.\n\nEvery day when you find yourself unhappy ask yourself why. If you can identify it as something you're doing cut it out. Don't stick to things out of habit if you aren't enjoying them. You will always have limited time, don't waste it on things just for the sake of doing it.",

I've seen many friends from my 20s fall into this trap. \n\nSo find a trade, business or profession that you're interested in and follow the path to achieving it. Even if you get there and after a few years decide its not for you, your better off then when you started.\n\nAnd remember the fairy tale story we're fed as kids about \"find a job you love and you'll never work a day in you life\" is a load of bunk. You can have you dream job and still find parts of it that are boring or unpleasant. That's life. I believe it creates an unrealistic precedence that makes us indecisive and ignores the fact that most professions start out unpleasant, like doing something menial while more experienced people do the \"real job\". You'll get there, everyone has to do their time. One day you'll look back on those experiences fondly seeing how much you learned.",

It’s assumed to be a good idea, but it’s why finances are such a mess and why inflation is so high and why half of Reddit is dying financially. \n\nThe truth is, even college is affordable if you go to community college for two years, love with your parents until you graduate, and finish your degree at a state school. \n\nPay cash for your car. Don’t go into debt for college tuition. Don’t get or use credit cards. Don’t play with debt, at all, until you’re at least 30. \n\nFor a few years, this means you will have to say ‘no’ to experiences that your friends get to do. It means you’ll be more limited, not eating out as much, not getting a nice car, etc. but in about 5 years after college/career you will be light years ahead of everyone around you. Without debt weighing you down and stealing your future choices you’ll be able to take risks no one else can. It opens so many doors it’s insane. And what you’ll learn is that, while in many ways your life is more modest than your peers, it’s also infinitely less stressful and easy to make whatever you want it to be. \n\nSeriously, if I could give one piece of advice to those going into life - don’t use debt at all. Wait until you’ve lived without it as an adult for 10+ years before you even begin to consider it. \n\n\nTo pre-respond to the many people who will fight me on this: Yes, debt CAN be as a helpful tool, but you don’t learn how to use a chainsaw by giving it to a child and saying “you’ll probably figure it out”. Except that’s exactly how we do it with debt. Want to teach someone how to use debt effectively? Have them live their first decade watching their friends take on 100k+ in student loans for a degree they never use. Watch those same people choose not to buy a house for their family because their car payment, credit card payments, student loans payment, tv payment…(this list goes on and on and on for most people). Watch them choose to keep both parents working even though one wants to stay home with the new kids, because one income just doesn’t cut it. Once a person has lived without debt for 10+ years and has had the lived experience of watching their friends and family be severely limited by debt while they have no such limits, only then are they ready to potentially use it in the limited ways that are healthy and beneficial to them long term.",

            "text": "Understand that you are entering the \"shit gets real\" decades of your life. It is time to start building your life. Build yourself physically (lift weights & cardio), build yourself financially, build your knowledge, build your experience, build your relationships. I'm not saying to not have fun, just know that the choices you make in every area of your life between now and the time you turn 40 will come back on you at least 10X. Neglect your health now? You will pay for it big time. Investing in your health now, you will reap the rewards. Ignore your financial health now? It will be almost impossible to get out of the hole and catch up later.  \nHere is my standard list of advice I give every time someone asks about \"advice for a young person.\"  \n\\- Don’t smoke  \n\\- Don’t be obese  \n\\- Take good care of your teeth  \n\\- Protect your hearing  \n\\- Meditate consistently  \n\\- Give yourself a non-negotiable 8 hour sleep opportunity every night. Ideally at the same time each night.  \n\\- Do not have kids outside of marriage  \n\\- Do not get married before age 23, waiting until at least 25 is probably even better.  \n\\- Learn about money, budgeting, debt, investing, finance, etc  \n\\- Read and study Marcus Aurelius Meditations, the Gregory Hays translation (978-0812968255)  \n\\- Read. Lots of non-fiction (history, biography, autobiography, philosophy, research-based psychology, etc)  \n\\- Constantly expose yourself to ideas and arguments you disagree with. Are you right-leaning? Expose yourself to lots of left-leaning ideas and arguments. Are you left-leaning? Expose yourself to lots of right-leaning ideas and arguments.  \n\\- Develop the skills of being punctual and organized. Being consistently late and disorganized is an ineffective way to go through life.  \n\\- Think very seriously about whether or not the time and money of a college degree is worth it for you. It might be. It might not be. But don’t do it “just because.\"  \n\\- When choosing your job/profession/career, ignore the horrible life advice to “follow your passion.” Instead, you should follow your aptitude. Identify what you are good at, find a way to use it to bring value to others, work like crazy to do that. The happiness/meaning/life satisfaction will come as a result of being able to build a good life for yourself and those you care about. For more on this, read the book So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport.  \n\\- Related to the previous point, assume you are not LeBron James, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Jay-Z. The vast majority of us will not build wealth and a high quality life for ourselves and those we care about by having a \"big payout.\" We probably won't win the lottery, start a company that becomes a billion dollar enterprise, or become an elite level superstar in a very exclusive field. Assume that you will have to build your life slowly, over time, taking advantage of the miracle that is compound interest. For more information, \\[watch this video\\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNrjrDV9-YQ).  \n\\- Try your best to get rich. It is a reality for most people that wealth equals power and the ability to have an impact. The best way to maximize your chances of building a good life for yourself, your loved ones, and contribute to the causes you care about is to get rich. Even if your primary focus is on fixing wealth inequality, your best shot at being able to make a meaningful impact on that issue is to get rich, then use your resources to work on the problem. A rich person can have a greater impact on wealth inequality than someone sitting in a park playing bongos smelling like weed and body odor while drinking their twelve dollar Starbucks milkshake that pretends to be coffee and complaining about capitalism.  \n\\- Practice humility. Reality is complicated. The truth of the matter is that you probably don’t know how to end war in the Middle East, end poverty, or solve any other of the world’s problems.  \n\\- If you live in the United States of America you should learn about guns. They are deeply embedded in our culture. If you are “pro-gun” you should understand the thing you think you support. If you are “anti-gun” you should understand the thing you think you oppose.  \n\\- Find a skill-based activity that you can work on and improve at over time. Piano, calligraphy, jiu-jitsu, golf, whatever. It's good for humans to have something they are constantly working on improving.  \n\\- Strive to eliminate the phrase, \"I don't think I should have to...\" from your life. It doesn't matter what you think you should have to do or what you think you shouldn't have to do. Identify where you are, identify where you want to be, identify what has to be done to get from here to there, and execute.  \n\\- Contempt is one of the most destructive emotions/attitudes there is. If you find yourself working for or with someone that has contempt for you and/or your work, be wary. Also be very mindful and cautious when contempt for someone else or what they do starts to arise in you.  \n\\- Get used to the idea that everything has side effects. There are no solutions, only trade-offs. We are prone to fall for the \"any-benefit fallacy.\" If a thing or choice has any benefit at all, we will tend to think it is a good idea and go after it while ignoring the negatives and costs. Instead, try thinking about the \"value\" of things. Consider not only their benefits, but their costs. And \"costs\" doesn't just mean money. \"Costs\" should include your time in the short term and long term, you mental capacity and well being, etc.  \n\\- Don’t blame things that are out of your control before you’ve taken care of things that are under your control. As an example, if you are obese but also don’t eat right, don’t exercise, don’t get good sleep, smoke, and drink too much alcohol, then don’t blame genetics for your obesity. After you’ve taken care of those other things, if you are still obese, then you can talk about your genetics.  \n\\- Don't get hung up on thinking you have to do all of the things on this list. Doing one of them is better than doing none of them. Doing two is better than doing one.",

            "text": "Wooo... I'm really talking to myself on this one, but for anyone it applies to, I offer the following (also, I'm on mobile, so I apologize for formatting):\n\nWork on your charisma and grammar. No, I'm not joking. Expand your vocabulary, and learn to employ a pleonastic fardel of hyper-brobdignagian words to render your audience in an aphasic stupor. Learning creative ways to speak well lends very kindly to the intelligent vibes you give off, and actually earns you respect from peers and superiors.\n\nRead regularly. It doesn't always have to be books, but you should at least know what's going on in the world. The least interesting person in the room will always be the one who seems to live under a rock. Combine this with the previous point and you'll have all of the tools to become a sparkling conversationalist. Just be careful that you don't come off as a pretentious know-it-all or else it'll all be for naught.\n\nLearn a trade, or at least the basics of a few trades. You should know how to change a tire, patch a hole in the wall, or something else like that. It exudes masculine energy that women LOVE. Plus it saves you money.\n\nWash your ass, balls and dick. Let's not fuck around here. Keep all of your equipment EXCEPTIONALLY clean. This goes DOUBLE if you're uncircumcised. And goddammit I mean squeaky clean. You have NO IDEA how it smells down there. Men talk so much about how women smell between their legs, but if you had any idea how much women were holding their tongues on this subject, you'd be astounded. Look into Lume, which is deodorant for private areas. Use that shit. Also, manscape. Keep the pubes well trimmed. Stay on top of all of your hygiene, but ESPECIALLY this.\n\nLearn how to dress. I'm super serious about this one. Watch YouTube videos if you have to. A well dressed man commands respect in every room he walks into. Invest no less than $20 per week in expanding your wardrobe, and alternate between business attire and leisure attire until your closet is filled with both. Also replace your boxers every six months (my suggestion is boxer briefs, women love them and they're super comfy and supportive). Learning how to dress will get you more respect, admiration and even opportunities.\n\nListen to understand, not just to respond. There's a difference. When you listen to understand, your empathy will kick in and you will do a lot less arguing. Practice the art of listening with intent. It will help you with all things, but ESPECIALLY with women. Listen to how she's feeling. Listen to what she says she wants in life, and in sex. Listen to what makes her moan the loudest, and apply that effort CONSISTENTLY (trust me, that alone will put you in the big leagues in her mind).\n\nSocialize often. Go to parties. Go to clubs. Go to mixers. But also learn to party with a purpose. Get yourself involved with events where successful people will be attending. Exchange contact information frequently and grow your network. Remember, your netWORK determines your net WORTH. \n\nLearn to cook and clean for yourself. And I mean at a near-professional level. A couple of good YouTube channels to follow are Recipe30 and Joshua Weissman. As a former chef myself, I can personally attest that a man who can cook well is virtually irresistible to women. So now you're a well-read, well-spoken, well-dressed, well-groomed man who is a good listener, good with his hands, keeps a clean house and knows how to cook. Congratulations, your confidence is now through the fucking roof. But there is more to address. \n\nLearn the stock market, and find creative (legal) ways to make money. Personally, I left the restaurant industry to do sales, and I have found success there. Follow your own financial path, but just make sure you're committed. Even a hot dog stand guy in NYC can gross $150k a year. There's money all around. Find it. If you've followed everything I've mentioned thus far, you won't find yourself too far removed from a lucrative business opportunity.\n\nDo NOT commit to long term relationships before your bag is right. Get your money up FIRST, build your credit, secure your finances 100% before you even consider bringing a woman into your life full term. And it's NOT because women are gold diggers or any sexist bs like that. It's because you literally can't get your mind right and find comfort in a relationship with a woman you REALLY care about if you can't do shit for her. And if she's bad (i.e. REALLY attractive), she's gonna have dudes willing to throw plenty more dick and money at her anyway. \n\nWith that, I must also add, be extremely HONEST with women. You'd be SHOCKED to learn what they're actually okay with. If you only want to have sex with them, just SAY THAT. You might lose a girl or two here or there, but you can find a solid fuckbuddy who won't hold you accountable if you're not emotionally attached. Just don't cheat. That's so friggin disrespectful. What if she had sex with someone else and infected you with something as a result? Or pinned a child on you? How would you feel if someone removed that choice from you? Keep this in mind and maintain sexual integrity, whether she is just a friend with benefits or a full on girlfriend/potential wife.\n\nActually LEARN how to please women. Sex is not some favour women do for men. It's meant to be mutually beneficial. Like, get actual education, don't just watch porn. Becoming an effective lover is just as important as being a loyal one. If you aren't knocking her socks off, somebody eventually will.\n\nStop fucking women RAW. Especially if you're not committed to them, or couldn't see yourself spending your life with them. You're gonna flush your life down the fucking toilet just for a jump-off you don't even like. That's STUPID. Strap up every time. And if that's too difficult, find and use VCFs (Vaginal Contraceptive Films), which are hormone-free and cause no problems to the women you use them with. An unethical life hack here would be to also ONLY sleep with women who are; (1) willing to use birth control, and (2) pro-choice.\n\nAnd if you do sire a child, get a DNA test IMMEDIATELY. I'm talm bout, legit ask a nurse in private while your girl is still in the recovery room after delivery. Waste NO TIME in verifying that shit. Trust me on this.\n\nGo to THERAPY. Big seriousness on this one. Most men lack emotional intelligence because of the indoctrinated belief that men are supposed to be emotionless. This actually causes more problems than it solves. And drives up the male suicide rate— trust me, your mental is NOT something you wanna fuck with. The body cannot exist without the mind.\n\nAnd lastly, go to the DOCTOR. Regularly. This is in no way the least important factor just because it's mentioned last. Get regular checkups. Get regular STD checkups. Go to the dentist. Take care of your body, because you only get one. You don't want to be in your 30s suffering from depression, obesity and obstructive sleep apnea which can affect everything from your mood, to your mental health, to your blood pressure, to your dick game. Just take care of yourself. Please.",

Ask your college advisor for a list of graduating salaries broken down by degrees. \n\nLive at home with your parents while you work on your goals if you can. Save what you can. Invest it wisely and/or use it for a down payment on a house. Don’t be too afraid of failure and don’t stay at a low paying job for too long. Try not to buy things to “look cool”. You’re going to 10x that money if you invest it instead. \n\nMake as many connections with young professionals as you can. The longer you know someone the better chance you’ll have each other’s backs. Hanging around successful people is better than hanging out with friends who drag you down. You’ll likely have career opportunities from it. Don’t forget to pay it forward after you make it. \n\nDrinking and weed is fine in moderation. Don’t let it run your life and don’t use more than once a week or so. You wouldn’t believe how lazy and unproductive it makes you.

Most of them weren’t great people. Looks fade but stupidity and greed stays forever. If you get cheated on once you need to move on. Don’t get married until you are absolutely positive they’re the one. Date for at least 2 years, be out of college and make sure you have a good paying job.

This is different that a standard testosterone test. Those 'regular' tests only compare your number with other lab customers and see if you're within range of their numbers. It does not give you a solid account of how much testosterone is in your system.\n\nUse this as your baseline when you get older and may need to take testosterone treatments (common). The Dr is going to want to get you to your baseline as close as possible and the number you get now would be a good place to start. The average range for Free Testosterone is 200-1000. I was tested at 150. They put me on a pill which caused my body to create more testosterone, not replace it (bad idea), and now it is 900.

            "text": "The best piece of advice I can give is this:\n1. It’s okay to fail. I’ve never met a successful person (wealth, health, spirituality, etc) who wasn’t afraid of failing.  I’ve taken more exams than most, and at the end of the day you need to remember it’s just a test.  Don’t let 20 questions, a presentation, or someone who knows nothing about you determine your worth.\n2. Have grit. A lot of people want to be successful but don’t want to go through the hard work and grind to attain it. Instead they continuously quit jobs, make excuses, or only do the bare minimum. You will be told “it’s impossible”, “you’re not good enough”, you may even be laughed at…but don’t hang your head.  Stick your guns and dig your heels in when it gets tough. No one is going to hand walk you through it, you have to develop the discipline and determination to reach your goals.\n3. Take a breath. It’s easy to become narrow minded and focused on the end result, but you need to take care of your mind and body. It sucks hearing, but you’re still a kid learning who you are.  No one is expecting you to know everything. So try new things, learn a language or an instrument, watch that movie, travel, etc.\n4. Learn. I cannot stress this one enough. Even if it’s 5-10 minutes a day pursue a hobby or something that interests you.  Before you know it, you’re playing the guitar for 10 years. Whatever it may be, those neural synapses are easier to form while your brain is still growing.  I highly recommend learning a new language if possible.\n5. Invest. I understand you may not have your dream job yet, but the sooner you prepare for retirement (etc) the better you’ll be prepared. Most banks have financial advisors available at no cost (looking at you Navy Fed) who will help create a portfolio to aide in your monthly budget.  \n6. Make the call. Listen, call your momma. Call your dad, your brother, sister…your family and friends. The only thing guaranteed tomorrow is that that red Sun is going to rise in the East.  Take the picture with your nephew, go watch your niece sing in her Christmas play.  Listen to grandpa and grandma’s stories. Enjoy their presence while it lasts. \n\nBottom line is this: You have the opportunity many of us wish we could re-attain in that you are young. Time is on your side! You’re in a period in your life where you can completely restart your life if you wanted to. Find out who you are and what your constitution stands for.",

Everything I enjoy doing is outside of my office and that's okay. I still have a fulfilled life. Don't ever sacrifice time with friends and family for work. You'll never get that time back and that time is far more valuable to you than it is to them.\n\n4.) Dude, it's okay to show emotions. Don't bottle it up and only lash out in anger. You're a human. Emotions are a part of the package deal. \n\n5.) Take care of your appearance. If you go on a date, dress a little nicer than usual. Bathe regularly, and buy some cologne that you like. Learn how to shave and properly groom yourself (keep nails well trimmed, trim your pubes, etc.). You'll impress people professionally, and it's a secret edge in the dating world. So many guys think it is feminine to take care of themselves and look and smell like ogres because of it. I'd rather have more in common with the other gender than a bridge troll, ya know?",

I got a law degree and a high stress job and it didn't work. I realized the validation I had been seeking didn't mean a thing. Mostly, I realized people weren't happy for my success, they just felt bad about their own shortcomings. Anyway, ditched my career to be a stay-at-home dad and I couldn't be happier. I remember not getting a job in my twenties and being absolutely devastated. In retrospect it wouldn't have mattered at all. All that matters too me is my family and my health. So I run most days and I spend most of my time with my favourite people, and I sleep like a stone. It's honestly silly how easy life can be if you don't stress over things that don't matter.\n\nThat does take me on to point #2: marry/partner well. No other decision you will ever make will have the same impact. Society has gotten weird, and our social circles are getting stretched pretty thin. But your partner will be there to support you. Pick someone you can depend on hell or high water. Looks don't really matter. They fade and the novelty wears off. Integrity is forever. Also, if you are going to have kids, seriously consider their genetics. I am pretty bright, but my partner is a genius, and our kids are fucking bright. Do you want beautiful kids or do you want kids who can change the world?",

You will still get there. Learn patience and forgiveness. Take care of your teeth. Dentures suck and implants are costly and expensive. Listen to old people. They have been there and can answer many of your life questions. People are all the same throughout the ages. The only thing that changes is technology. Remember, Poop gonna happen. Learn to adapt , overcome, and improvise.  hearts heal and grieve will be a memory. Time is your friend and enemy. Learn to use time wisely. Wash your hands and cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing. Carry a handkerchief. Take care of your health. Know first aide and CPR. Get physicals yearly. In Times of mental hardship and stressful events mental therapist can help. Get medical insurance. When I was in my 20s I developed hypotension. I did not treat it and now have kidney disease and a pacemaker. Take care of your family, your mind and body. Remember, others are counting on you even if you think they don’t need you. Be kind to all people. But trust people slowly. Just as there are good people there are some very bad ones. Protect your family and yourself. Trust but verify. Question and keep your distance. Learn situational and environmental awareness. Learn marital arts and exercise. There is no such thing as race. People are people. Treat all people equally and fairly. Be generous, but also thrifty and save now! If you get married and have to cheat, get a divorce. It is not fair to your partner. Don’t stay in a non-loving relationship, be it for loyalty or the children. Divorce is painful but living a lie is not fair to you or anyone. Always treat your partner with respect, especially in public. Be honest and don’t lie. Talk with each other. Lies will always come back to bite you in the butt. Give the greatest gift to your children, your time and interest, Study, read books, think, travel and obtain an  education. If you cannot afford an education, teach yourself, question, discuss, and think. Learn to work with your hands. Respect manual labor. Hard work is good for mind and body. But too much kills the spirt and hurts you and your family. Do family trips, games, and eat at the table without the TV. Always talk well of others. Do not gossip or talk behind a person’s back. When you make a mistake acknowledge it and seek solutions. Mistakes get bigger and harder to solve as time continues. When you make a mistake understand what it was and don’t beat yourself up. Others will do that for you. Friends and lovers come and go but you will always have yourself. Be kind, understanding, and most important forgive yourself. Only God is perfect. When you leave a job always talk well about the management and your boss. Leave gracefully. Even if you not like the person you worked for. Do not burn bridges. The ass you kick today maybe the ass you have to kiss tomorrow. If people work for you, respect and pay them well. Help them get health insurance. If you work for someone give him/her an honest days work. When away from friends speak proper standard English. People judge you first by your words and appearance. Don’t slouch. Keep your hair cleaned and groomed. Trim your nails and polish your shoes or keep your athletic shoes clean. People look top to bottom, first head, then teeth, nails, clothes, then shoes. You only have one opportunity with each person to make a positive impression. Contribute to family, country, and job. Do military or public service. Military service can open the world for you. Vote, know who is running and why. Know the difference between Anarchism, Communism, Socialism, Social Democrats, Democrats, Republicans, Fascism, and libertarianism. They are not the same and cannot be used interchangeably. Know who the politicians are and where they stand. Do not vote for anyone who cheats on their spouse, steals, abuse people, or cheats on their taxes. Speaking of pricks cover yours, wear a condom. It protects you and your partner. You do not want to give the gift that keeps giving and you are too young to be called daddy. Your parents do not want to be called grandma or grandpa at this time in your’s or their life. Fifty percent in life you can control and the other fifty’ percent you have no control. Many times you don’t know which you can control. So act like you can control everything or you will miss opportunities. Always keep improving yourself and prepare for opportunities. Be prepared. There are very few second chances. Be humble but confident. Don’t make jokes until you know a person. Don’t tease or make fun of people. You don’t know what has happened to them in life. Know the difference between empathy and sympathy. Learn self control. A warrior’s greatest threat is himself. Mastering oneself is an continuous challenge. There is so much more to know. These are the basics. I know no one will read this. It is long but life is not simple, but I have tried. When in doubt ask an old person.",

On the subject of relationships: talk to each other about the important shit. If you can't talk about that it won't last no matter what you do. Above all else, be loyal to them at all costs. I've seen men and women alike lose wonderful partners because they just had to fuck that girl or that guy. No one, not a single person deserves to wonder why they weren't enough.

Understand that you have roles in life that you are either regressing or progressing. These roles start with (providing) for you and your future family, (protecting) you and your future family from technology and porn intake, (pastoring) yourself and your future family, (parenting) when you have kids. (Pursuing)- always purse your wife when you get married. \n\n3. Pursue to be a Man of integrity, excellence and honesty. \n\n4. Remember that most men living today have not found their passion or purpose. Spend time in your 20’s and find what you love and what you are good at. Competence/character/chemistry are 3 great things to look at when you are deciding what you want to do with your life. It’s important to understand this… you will spend 80,000 to 100,000 hours of your life working. \n\n5. Purse hobbies in the outdoors like fishing/hunting/Campjng. We were created as men to be challenged and play in the dirt. Do something that makes your heart come a live. We were not created to live behind these screens each day. Humble yourself by going outside and chopping some wood.(lol)\n\n6. Last and not least…. Understand that you were created uniquely and most precious by a creator. That life pursuit of a creator is UNBELIEVABLE it would be a shame to experience this world and NOT come to the understanding of WHO was the engineer and the designer of YOU. That is the most important quest of a mans life. The answer to this Question is JESUS CHRIST. Don’t let the world fool you and think that he wasn’t real and didn’t walk this earth. I have lived all over the world and have seen men from the tribal lands of Indonesia come to fall on their Stone Age faces to worship Jesus. He was the ULTIMATE example of being a MAN and a man that gave his life for ALL. He was kind and had the power to come back from the dead. WOW!! Let him be your NORTH STAR.",

Get a hobby that GETS YOU OUTSIDE and one that CONTRIBUTES TO SOCIETY AND YOUR WELL BEING. You're a fucking man. Learn to weld, learn to shoot guns, learn to change a fuckin starter on a car. Learn to build a shed. Learn to run plumbing. Learn how to dig a fuckin hole so you can bury yourself already if you don't stop with the toys cause you're already dead. If the men who hoarded toys put half the effort they put into collecting as they did getting forward in life, you would be swimming in pussy, happiness and peace of mind.   \nHonestly, if you are reading this, and you collect toys as a man, answer this question for me. What would make you feel more satisfied as a man and a human being, knowing you for that 35th Transformer toy cause this one is \"special\" (which we all know is BS) or knowing you fixed your gf's car for free, build her a fuckin garden shed, fixed the fuckin kitchen sink for her that leaks?  \nLearn boxing. Learn MMA, Learn karate, something that may be beneficial to your safety one day if needed. Tell a would be attacker you have an excellent toy collection isn't gonna stop you from getting your ass beat.   \nAvoid fights at all cost, unless there is no choice, but make sure if you HAVE to make that choice, you can.   \nPossessions do not mean ANYTHING in the grand scheme of things, so stop thinking they do, they don't.   \nPeople say money doesn't buy happiness and it doesn't, however, money CAN buy you the things that may lead you to happiness. So try to get a side hustle to make some spending cash. (If you were the toy hoarder, STOP, sell that shit, buy a project car and start learning how to fix it up. Learn to love that car, put your soul into that car then sell it and start again.   \nDon't worry about what other people think. Even me.   \nDon't be afraid to tell people no, or to fuck off.   \nDOn't let women take advantage of your heart, for any reason, ever. EVER. E V E R.   \nI am not trying to be an asshole, I am just trying to real and direct with out candy coating anything. Again, I am a no one and what I say means nothing, but I hope someone, some where can get something from this.   \nIf you play music in a band, protect your ears, mine are wrecked and ring 24/7.
