As I have grown so has my accuracy and power. I believe that on nights where I consume large volumes of beer I can effectively get to 6 foot away from the toilet and produce a quite brilliant and spectacular spectacle. I will sometimes increase the difficulty level by playing basket ball game on my phone and see how many hoops I can score whilst continuing to pee. 5 foot and 4 inches and 29 hoops in succession is my world record. As you will notice, the distance is not my record, distance appears to decrease with number of hoops made... This in part is due to the rule that I have laid out for myself. If I miss the toilet and pee anywhere outside of the bowl it is immediately game over. There is no second lives. I have to try again next time. Scoring hoops may continue even if I miss one but the counter resets to zero.

At home I basically drink water and milk and when I want a 'treat' of some kind of sugary drink I make some Kool-aid.\n\nBut, because I'm in Canada, we no longer have the classic Kool-aid packets available for purchase (yes really, they stopped selling them here years ago for some reason and it's only the overpriced pre-made Kool-aid drinks available) so I have to buy them on Amazon in large quantities. I've almost used all the packets that I've had for years and years now. They all 'expired' between 3 and 4 years ago but they're just Kool-aid powder so I'm not very concerned. I think I bought them in packs of 48 so it takes a while to go through them all.",

Like impressively cold. Probably carcinogenic for how little it makes sense. When I'm feeling anxious at night, I pinch it at the opening between my index and middle finger until it warms, then slide around the opening that way.\n\nI never realized how important it was to me really until an ex of mine threw it out and I couldn't find it. He was very excited to surprise me with new pillowcases which was a kind gesture since most of mine were older than sin (with the floral one being probably older than me) But I remember being filled with this intense unease and my eyes tearing up and asked where the old one was. And he told me hesitantly it was in the trash in the kitchen, and quickly realized that it was a mistake to throw it out without telling me.\n\nThe thing is see through at this point and the label disintegrated years ago. I've occasionally Googled trying to find it and seeing if I can get a pillow case with a similar composition when it's finally unusable.\n\nBut it really is an almost mystifyingly cold pillowcase. Always has been, and new people who see it (it's very ugly honestly) will comment on it and then I'm like \"Touch it\" and they're confused at how it somehow is so much cooler than any other surface in the room.\n\nBut yeah, I'm 32 and still have my security...

I don't remember why, but we decided to call them thumbgangs.\n\nHere's a list of about half of the thumbgangs we created together.\n\n- **Walker** : An incredibly obnoxious and easily killed biped that communicates by tapping the floor with his feet. Walkers used to always get their revenge when wronged, but we phased that out once we realized it's way to more fun to mutilate incredibly obnoxious walkers (and to be incredibly obnoxious as a walker). \n    - Made by clenching a fist, extending the index and middle finger, bending them to form knees, and placing said fingers on the ground\n\n- **Poundspider** : A fat, geeky ten legged spider that has a muffled voice because his mouth is on his belly. They fucking love to eat walkers and watch tv. They can convert any electronic device into a super computer and hack the world in seconds, building fortifications around themselves with robots in the process. They shoot webbing, can expel hurricain force wind from their mouth, and as their namesake, can increase their weight SUBSTANTIALLY. Usually to avoid predators. This is accomplished by sinking through the earth and turning to impenetrable stone (which they can also do). \n\n - Made by extending all fingers on both hands, placing the dominant hand over the other, and putting your hands on a flat surface. They see primarily with the eyes located on their index fingers, so those are usually raised up as the other legs go limp.\n\n- **Squeeker** : A humanoid bird-like being that is, like the walker, incredibly annoying. The children of Igors, Squeekers are immature in the extreme and always looking for mindless fun. They are addicted to chocolate but will likely destroy the world from the sugar rush it gives them. Staring at themselves in any mirror will also likely result in massive explosions, but only once someone notices they are about to kill everyone in the immediate vicinity. They love to mess with anyone and everything, including other Squeekers, especially by poking them, and constantly kill and mame (actions which their parents have to subsequently correct and HARSHLY punish the Squeeker for).\n\n - Made by widening the eyes and parsing the lips while bringing your jaw up to form a round upper lip. They typically have their hands folded towards the sides of their bellies.\n\n- **Chomper** : A mindless, vicious, carnivorous, yet stoic pack animal made from living metal that uses electromagnetic fields to propel themselves at peoples faces. Most activities provoke them, but occasionally they can be found sitting and sharpening their teeth on their (thumb) lower tooth. Chompers shred people alive in a whiring of slicing violence. They love to eat Poundspiders and will eventually find the Poundspider's weak spot that reverts their stone into flesh. They can be calmed by masagging the back of their heads, in which case they go completely limp and let you continue.\n\n - Made by looking at your palm, pulling the thumb towards your face, them connecting the pinky and index fingers, placing them on the thumb, and finally putting the middle and ring finger on top of the other two. Simply pull all fingers towards the palm in a scrunched up angry likeness, and you have a Chomper.\n\n- **Monsieur Potato/El Potato** : Potatos are seemingly plump and delicious eldritch beings with infinite insides leading to new universes of pleasure and pain, or complete nothingness. They suck anything and everything into their maws with the force of a blackhole. Trying to talk to one is both useless and absurdly dangerous as they will doubtless consume you unless you feel no fear of them. While contemplating your consumption, they will speak unknowablely powerful words which typically sound like insults or descriptions of your upcoming fate. They have all power. All glory to El Potato.\n\n - Made by making a fist and placing the thumb onto your curled index finger to form a mouth. They like to waggle back and forth on the ground to get around. If they feel especially good about themselves, they may lift up their thumb in a display of hubris.\n\n- **Igor** : Like the Potato, Igors are eldritch beings with incredible power. They are adult Squeekers humiliated by their past and will constantly seek out injustice to punish wrongdoers and undo their evil deeds. Usually that means torturing obnoxious Squeekers. Igors are vile in the extreme, though noble and stoic in attitude. Their farts level cities, their sausage (of which they are very fond of and use as currency) is deadly to any human. Anger an Igor, or do any evil deed with one knowing or discovering it, will mean pain and suffering to you. Possibly for eons in a time-slowed pocket universe. They have virtually limitless power, but only use it for their version of good. They respect and are likewise respected by Potatos.\n - Made by Frowning and clenching one side of your mouth upwards, then stick out your jaw (typicallly with your mouth still closed).",
