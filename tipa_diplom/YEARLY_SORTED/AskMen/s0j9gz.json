I tried to hint that maybe we should leave now and maybe meet up later but then she wasn’t picking up any hints and was continuously bombarding me with information about her university and her teachers etc which didn’t really interest me. So i just picked up my phone once and texted “sos” to my friend and started waiting for the call.\nA few minutes later my phone rang and there she was acting like someone in her family was really sick and I needed to go there immediately to check up on them. I was absolutely silent for the first minute because it was very difficult controlling my laughter hearing her act like that. But then i regained my composure, gave her some advice over the phone and told her i’ll be there in 30 mins. I hung up, told my date that i have to leave now, booked her a cab, left.",

We are chatting and she puts her elbow on the table next to us (mind you with people sitting there) and FULL OK FACEPLANTS as the linen slipped out from under her elbow. Face smashes into the table and makes a huge clatter; I immediately stood up walked over to our waitress, gave her $100 bill and walked out.

That part was fine but that’s just because crazy girls are really fun.\n\n-she lies about literally everything online, so when we make a date to see a movie together, she’s underage, she’s brought alone five friends she expects me to pay for, suggests we get dinner afterword, and wants me to buy her and her friends booze, then tells me I’m too old for her. This was all within the first five minutes of meeting in person. She looked nothing like her picture, let’s leave it at that.\n\n-talked for a while online, couple months, exchanged pictures, even got close to the whole “I love you” intensity before meeting at all, then I drive up to SF to spend our first weekend together. She’s dating her roommate already, who finds it really strange that her friend has suddenly come to stay with them, and stranger still that his gf is deciding to sleep out on the couch with him. It was cool though because once I got there she basically pretended I didn’t exist.

She turns around, tears in her eyes and she starts talking to me.  I'm high as fuck right now in the date so I'm wildly distracted by everything.  The only thing keeping me present was the massage.  So I'm staring at her, trying to make out the words she saying, but the diction she is using just doesn't make sense.  She says sentence but what!?  So she's crying, rambling nonsense, probably high as fuck too, I'm high as fuck, trying to concentrate on her, but I can't.  I just come to the conclusion to fuck it.  So I'm like, \"Ya, I can't do this.  You're hot, but I have no idea what the fuck you're saying or why you're crying and I have no idea how to proceed.\" I've put my shoes on and stand up (I actually left my belt undone until I was like halfway to my car before I noticed). I said, \"Everything tonight that we've talked about and we've been physically close, and we've talked about hooking up.  Wasn't this supposed to lead to sex!?  Instead you're crying and I'm not going to be an emotional sponge for you just to get in your pants.\"  I start to walk out, open the door and about to close it. \"Next time, put out.\"  Wait what the fuck did I just say!?  Fuck, I'm an asshole.  But that was pretty smooth lol.  Damn, was I an asshole, but I just didn't want to continue the emotional baggage dump on me.  So I said bye!\n\nShe was 47, I was 33.  There was no way it was going to work out, but she was fucking hot.  That first night we met (we just randomly met at a bar), I was goosing her all night, we were making out and flirting and talking spirituality type stuff.  We were just vibing together, I was going to take her home (or her with me) and then probably never see her again.  Her friend said I should be mysterious and leave randomly.  I trusted her and left randomly (with a phone number of course, I ain't stupid, well I am because I left).  I shouldn't have left that first night. \n\nIt helped me learn about myself though.

I told him how I was about to study to reapply to dental school…he immediately asked me what my GPA was in college. I was like “I graduated with a 3.0, which isn’t great, but I think if I work hard to get a good DAT score or do a masters program that I’ll be able to get in.” His response: “HAHA you have no chance getting into dental or any medical field-related school with that GPA sweetheart. Maybe you should look into marketing or nannying.” …Then starts boasting about being a physical therapist & how much money he makes. \n\nI lived a 3 minute walk from the restaurant & got up without saying anything & just walked home. 😅",

Her and I weren’t tipsy but hit it off talking and chatting the whole night without interacting with other people. She said that no one talks to her because they are intimidated etc. which seems to be a common thread with really good looking people? So we go in the room and as she is she is undressing and things are getting really hot, some guys on the street below (We we’re on like the 5 or 6th floor) we’re doing wheel spins and just messing around. She turns around to look at the noise and she is bent over the window totally naked looking absolutely incredible like a fucking movie and she then starts screaming the most hectic racial slurs that I have EVER heard. She went almost through like an alphabet of slurs against African guys. We are both white South Africans but sorry for the overshare but I went from hard to soft to shriveled 2nd belly button…. And I grabbed my clothes and snuck out… two weeks later I go on a date with a girl and we go back to my place and she is like I know you from somewhere and I had no idea except we had mutual friend (colleague of hers and high school bud of mine) so as she is undressing she goes OH SHIT YOU WALKED OUT ON MY SISTER AT MY 21st!….. I was mortified, but, turns out she was the nice one as I explained why etc and we chatted for hours in bed and did zero physical things until 5 minutes before she had to leave for work and she jumped me and ground me into my mattress…. 6 years later we were married.\nThe model claims she didn’t say any of that stuff, but she lives in Australia and we live in Ireland/ south Africa.",

She used filters and looked average, I expected a pouch but when she arrived it felt like humpty dumpy sat down, so I let that egg crack and left. \n3. She sent me photos from 1994...I was hoping it wasn't true..that perhaps they were just \"bad quality\" but I could tell the pictures were from several decades ago when she sat down...so I left. \n4. So I was chatting with this 42 year old on Tinder who had like no lines on her face, and no blemishes, and they basically looked completely edited and had lots of animal and dog ears but I said she's just a natural girl and must have good genes but when she showed up, I thought it was the crypt keeper, and she looked 79..so I left. \n\nIn summary, stop heavily editing your photos. JUST STOP. Stop adding dog ears and animal parts. Stop using filters. \n\nWomen and men, include 1 full body photo but don't wear a black jump suit that's hard to decipher..ot called a body shot for a reason...they will see if you're fat, thin, skinny, short...just own up to it..let them pass online versus ghosting you later. \n\nStop sending old pics, no pics older than a year. And guess what...have an awesome (or horrible) new hair style that drastically changed you or new facial hair??? Yay new pics for you.",

I have absolutely no clue what we talked about.  But she blocked me on everything and I haven’t seen or heard from her since… I wish she could meet me now when I’m sober. Cuz she really did like me I think, and I liked her too, but then I fucked it up and barely remember how.  Moral of the story,  if you haven’t fully learned to love yourself and are still battling your own demons.  Don’t waste your,  or anyone else’s time.  Even if you’re able to find love,  you’ll inevitably ruin it and hurt yourself and others.  Plus the love is so much better once you also love yourself,  and you don’t NEED others to love you… sorry for the rant, it was soothing! Much love to all and IWNDWYT!\n\nEdit: wording",

She mentioned she was in town for a short while visiting her sister at university and she was staying at a hotel. A lot of our messages were quite steamy so meeting at her hotel didn't seem out of the blue. I arrived at the hotel room, knocked on the door number she had messaged me to go to. There was no answer, I waited a bit and opened the door slowly. I remember the room was dark as hell. It wa the middle of the afternoon but all the lights had been turned off and curtains drawn shut. From the corner of the room I could see a silhouette of a person standing by the window. As she came closer, she was wearing some sexy lingerie. I noticed the skin glistening in the distance. I started reaching for a light switch and she shouted \"NO!\" in a really deep husky voice. I thought \"wtf\", she slowly and seductively stepped forward and low and behold it was some random nerdy dude wearing lingerie think Milhouse but tall and skinny as fuck). I said I'm \"getting the fuck out of here!\" to which he replied \"Don't go!...I'll suck your dick better than any girl ever will\" It turns out the sister that was being \"visited\" at university was the girl whose photos I had been admiring on the profile.

She looked like pictures, rather pretty and whatnot. But I go pick her up, and we head out to a local distillery/winery. One of the first things out of her mouth is, \"wait, if your dad's a doctor, why do you have this beat up old truck\".\n\nI re-explain that both my parents are doctors, and then tell how they split when I was 8 in an extremely costly divorce, so there's some hella rich lawyers' kids out there, but not this guy. Furthermore, I'm a grown ass adult, I'm not tryina live off something I don't earn. In conclusion, it's not super polite to talk trash about a man's pickup like that (I'm a fastidiously clean person, and the truck was a very well-kept 14 years old).\n\nShe doesn't seem to agree, and I'm getting the vibe that she'd love to get pregnant by one of the owners of said superyachts. Arrive to the place. As y'all have seen from the other stories, she gets pretty drunk, I'm figuring yeaaaaah this is prolly a shitshow but fuck it, let's roll some dice.\n\nHead back to the city to go to the restaurant we'd talked about. En route, my cousin calls me, does need me to pick up something (that had been a potential plan, and I'd told The Date). She flips a little bit, and just says she'll get a place at the bar of the restaurant. The errand takes only 20 minutes - yes this was my free opportunity to bounce, she was decently close to the marina where I'd picked her up, but a) polite Southern gentleman, with b) horny 25 year old brain - and I'm back to the restaurant.\n\nShe's chatting with these two guys at the bar, and they leave pretty immediately after I show up. I ain't mad, she doesn't like owe me a vow of silence or anything, but I am curious when she said they were friends (she'd never been to my city before). Like, if they were friends then cool, let's hang out; if they were just guys trying to holler, then that's understandable too, but the lying was weird.\n\nEnd up leaving there after eating and head to a bar with live music near the marina, at this point totally recognizing that this is a trainwreck but I'm entertained. We have a drink, she gets another, she says she has to take a call, and after fifteen minutes and see that she's just talking to somebody else in person outside, figure that's enough.

Attractive, smart, great personality, basically exactly my type. Not the best idea to jump from one relationship to another but hey whatever.\n\nShe seemed super excited to go for drinks so we went to a new spot in town. Immediately clicked, lots of laughs, lots of flirting, lots of drinks. Ended up pretty tipsy and quickly got into the sexual talk. Both leaning across the table so we can be close to each other and smell the tequila on each other's breaths we're talking about different positions, what she likes, what I like, etc.\n\nShe brings up one position that I had *just* tried with my ex about a month prior and although it was nothing fancy it was new and exciting. Without thinking, my response was \"oh fuck I did that with my ex and I can't even believe how good it felt!\"\n\nSo of course that ruins the mood, she leans back and just says \"really? I don't want to hear about your ex...\" I had to actually think about what I did for a second and if I actually said that.\n\nUnfortunately I couldn't redeem myself and we got the bills and she gave me a big hug but wished me luck getting over my ex; never talked again.",

She told me she was like a month away from being 18, trying to get my attention and generally being really flirty. At first i didnt bother coz i was grinding a season pass at LOL but the it hit me. Bro you need to get laid. You haven't had sex for like a year or so and onse you enlist its gonna be another year. And she is basically giving it to you.\n\nSo im like damn I'm dumb i should try it. Days before we meet we were really savage on the messages. Like we gonna fuck from the shandeleers up side down kinda kinky savage. \n\nThe day comes and I dress up with a polo shirt, nice jeans and stuff. Im on the phone with her and we are like:\n- Where are you im there.\n- Turn, turn a bit more, Turn.... Hi :)\n\nOmg my heart dropped but in a bad way. The girl on the insta was at best a 6 but when i saw her..... Omg. \nTorn up clothes, Dirty shirt, polo bag from highschool with all kinds of bandanas, 5 colours on her greasy hair and def allot more pounds than her photo's. Propably more than me and im a 100kg fucker. \n\nShe comes to French kiss me and im like the fucking king Tut. Frozen like a ice cube. Thank god i was like 40cm taller tahn her and she couldn't reach me and i also went like not here I'm shy and shit. \n\nI find a chance and text my brother:\nCall me in 10 mins. Say dad is not good im scared. Cry! \nI need to get out now. \nFucker was laughing his ass off and im like its serious i need out now.\nMe bro was 18 t the time. \n\nTime is passing and she is like come closer i wanna feel you, gime a kiss and stuff. We were hanging at a bench and every minute she was coming closer to me. I was out of bench to sit further. She wws ready to grab me and my phone rang. OMG I SIKED. I couldn't hold it. The my brother is like dad is not good blanbla come home now. I pick up the girl, get her home in like 10 mins and im leaving town. windows down, music blasting and me singing along happyer than ever that i didn't get laid that night. \n\nNever again i tried discord chicks or Instagram meetings. Best decision I took in that period in my life.\n\nTldr: met a girl online, she was nothing like the pictures i call my brother to save me the last moment. Got back home with tears of joy.",

I put my field of study in the bio and this guy started the convo saying that he too wanted to pursue that path but ended up doing something a little easier for him. His pics were from all kind of places around the word and he seemed cute enough, the profile said he was 24. At some time during the conversation I told him that I spend a lot of time at a particular library and he goes like “oh my place is the next street from there, wanna come over?” I was 19 but not that dumb so I told him I don’t feel safe going to anyone’s place if I haven’t met them first. He decides to come to said library to met me and have a walk around, that sound acceptable and I agreed. He brought me to a notoriously “romantic” place (think high terrace with a panoramic view on the city) and while there he said “you know what would be nice now?” Implying he wants a kiss, I was already too deep into the trouble so I went with it, it was like kissing your grandma, he just stamped his closed lips over mine, weird flex but ok better for me. At some point he told me that I probably has some sight problems because I could read some inscription on a statue from very far away, again weird flex. He wanted to carry my backpack for the whole time we walked and it basically looked like a father walking his daughter. At some point I mentioned that he looked a little different in the pics and he said that “the app” messed up his age and he was in fact 28 not 24 (to this day I still don’t believe him, he had some wrinkles, my best guess would be he was around 32 at the time). That was the final straw I needed, I told he I wanted to go home and he insisted to walk me to the station. I ended up walking like 14km because this dude didn’t want to take the subway. At the station he kinda leaned in for another “kiss” but I just told him to give my backpack back and basically run to the train. I thought he understood that I wasn’t interested so I deleted his number but didn’t think to block him. Few days later he texts “look I know I’m older but give me another chance, come to my place, I’ll get a nice bottle and see what happens” hell no. I blocked him. I met him after a year or something around my university area and he was like “countess_cat! It’s been so long, how are you” I told him I was ok and started walking. He tried to start a conversation saying that he got a job as a technician at an institution in my field of study and he could land me a job or something. Told him I was late and run away.",

We were all in a small historic house on campus, antique furniture, really an idyllic place for an intimate session with a reserved but brilliant author. Great experience!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got sat directly across from a moderately attractive girl. We had a class together but never really talked. Kind of mysterious looking, not the bubbly college girl stereotype by any means. She took vigorous notes throughout the lecture in very pleasant handwriting(as far as I could see upside down from across a table). She was dressed well. She was not the most beautiful woman I had ever seen or anything but her mannerisms impressed me for the most part. I decided \"why not try?\" and as our author finished I approached her and asked if she wanted to get lunch together.\n\nShe said yes and we went. She had giggled inappropriately a few times during the lecture, but I thought she was just really into the moment or whatever.\n\nWe started walking to a restaurant to get lunch, and after some basic introduction to make a totally spontaneous \"date\" less awkward she hits me with:  \"Can you believe we had to listen to that guy for an hour and a half? Fuck him.\" -- not the conversation I expected to have after a reading from a respected author!\n\nIt turns out she was there for a class that was giving extra credit for attending. Her notes and dress were to impress her teacher that was there because she was struggling in the class. I misread her so badly. I awkwardly survived the walk to the restaurant, went to the bathroom and texted my roommate to pick me up. I came back to her to say \"oh man I'm so sorry but my roommate needs me to take him to the hospital!\"\n\nLiterally ran until I was out of view of the restaurant window then had that roommate pick me up to go to a different restaurant.",

He loves old muscle cars and has a ‘67 Torino he’s working on, and I have a passion for them too.  He’s active duty military and I’m a vet so I’m 100% aware of all the inner workings when it comes to dating someone in that profession.  Just all around great chemistry, conversation comes super easy.\n\nI show up at his house for pizza and a movie for the first date.  Things go exceptionally well and we end up making out and doing the thing before the movie is half way over.  We cuddle for a while and I decide not to sleep over because I’m in love with my own bed and we part ways with kisses ‘n all that.\n\nI let a day or so go by before I text him that I really enjoyed his companionship and that I’d like to see him again.  And this is where it goes downhill.  He responds a day after that with, “I enjoyed our time together too, but I’m not looking to date someone who sleeps with me on the first date.”  *Fucking what??*  To this day I still cannot comprehend why someone would say something like that when he’s the one who literally took my pants off, but whatever.  Bullet dodged.\n\nAnother bad one was talking to a guy a few years younger than I, I think he was in his mid 20’s.  Decided to show up at his place to watch a movie and chat.  The second I saw him I knew something was off; he looked like he hadn’t bathed or washed his hair in a week or two.  The second he opens his apartment door the stench smacks me right in the face.  Now I’ve been in some really rough places (I’ve literally waded through shit in Iraq and a few of my childhood friends lived in squalor) so I walk in.  The kitchen is non-existent; it’s literally filled with loose refuse and trash bags from floor to over counter tops.  The fridge door has dirt stains all over it and the walls are that tell-tale banana cream yellow.  The living room looks much the same with a extremely soiled mattress on a metal frame being at one end surrounded by piles of filth and refuse.\n\nHe walked in and sat on the bed and asked me where I wanted to sit and made the most trivial attempt at clearing a space for me.  I wanted to nope out so badly, but I knew what I was looking at; I just didn’t know the why.  Without taking more than a few steps into the place I politely told him that I didn’t feel comfortable and that we could talk outside.  \n\nI ended up mentoring the guy and tried to encourage him to do better for himself in the most gentlest of ways that I could.  It was super obvious that his family was incredibly dysfunctional, as was he, and that they needed help in the worst of ways.  I never spoke to him again after that, although I did tell him that if he ever needed advice or someone to talk to that he could message me, and I honestly hope he’s doing alright.  Living like that is a cruel existence.",

It's about 10 minutes into the date and I already want to leave and she's already starting to just be distant and when I say bland and dry conversation I don't mean she's talking to me, more like she's avoiding talking to me and it's really basic replies, but I say \"you know what?\" Let's see how long this goes.\n\nI very loosely walk around with her and try to make my own fun with the situation. (We were at a mall and I had some free time) so I just walk around and do some shopping. She sees I have some money on me and decides to go into this expensive shoe store. She grabs a bunch of items and we are in the line at the register. When we get to the teller, she looks at me, doesn't say anything and then sharply realized I wasn't paying for anything there and proceeded to scramble for her purse. Right after this happened she decides to call a dude on FaceTime to try and make me feel bad or whatever. So I just made an excuse to leave and left. \n\nAfterwards I text her and asked her why she thought it was okay to do that. She replied that I wasn't what she imagined.

It was her second question within the first 5 minutes. The first one was \"what do you do for a living?\".  I told her I'm a marketing assistant at a chemical company. Her eyes started to shine brighter, made her lips wet and started to caress the brim of her wine glass. Her enthusiasm soon collapsed  when I told her I barely make more than minimum wage. (first job after graduation in Hungary).\n\nAs the twinkle in her eyes faded, my eyes just started shining brighter from the possibility to have a memorable date. I quickly told her that despite the shitty starting salary I already got a company car.  \n\"Really???\" - she straightened up, put her hand closer to mine. It was really easy to tickle her interest. \n\"Yeah, a 22 years old Opel Astra\". I said with a big smile as she dropped her shoulders again and said in a slightly broken voice \"oh, okay\".  \nI enjoyed the emotional rollercoster so much! I told her that I invested in stocks though, because I heard there is good money in those. I want to move to a new place. \nShe could have won the Most Massive Boner of a Gold Digger  performance AVN award. She started smiling again. Life came back to her cheeks, she started shining.\n \n\"I mean, I only lost money so far, so I still have to live where I grew up. At least for a while\".  This was a Hiroshima moment for her and Nagasaki soon followed. She asked me where I grew up. I had lived in the 'projects' with  4 and 10 stories panel buildings, concrete pingpong table, the classic mid-eastern european blocks you know.  I shit you not, she said \"Oh my god, I'm so sorry\". Like I just told her I have leukemia or something... \n\nSo this went on for like 20 more minutes. I got tired but she looked pale and withered by this rollercoster of emotions. I could have chosen mercy, but... nah. I have no problem with paying on dates, but this was too good of an opportunity for a final blow. \n\"So we are splitting the bill, right?\". Btw, it was a café, and she ordered the most expensive wine from the menu. I had a beer.\nShe whispered a \"yeah\" as someone when they let the last word out on a deathbed. She reached in her bag for her wallet and MAINTAINED EYE CONTACT WITH ME FOR LIKE A WHOLE MINUTE while she was looking for it. \n\nWe paid, she turned her back and left without saying goodbye or go fuckmyself or anything. \nGood date.",

She mentioned it was a bit messy but I thought how bad could that be, I'm messy at times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to her place - Her apartment was absolute chaos. Dust everywhere, kitchen sink topped up with plates, pizza boxes, and just random shit laying around all over the place.\n\nThis really put me off, but I thought I'd just deal with it as all I wanted a quick lay.\n\nWe started smoking weed (more like she was smoking joints and I'd have a few tokes) and she wanted to show me the music she was into. She made me listen to this whole techno situation which had an Alan Watts speech as a voice over, and there there was no chatting between us while listening. She would look at me to check my reactions whenever something deep was mentioned. Once the thing was over, turns out it was part 1/3, so we had to listen to the others as well.\n\nOnce they ended, I asked if we could play some of my music so we did.\n\nWe're finally making out, but she would stop all the time to thank me for the music I was showing her, but being like extra thankful. She'd look me in the eyes and say \"thank you so much for this\", like I've shown her the way or something. She would also stop to do a quick aromatherapy, which was kinda nice, but then again, not the time.\n\nAnyways, during most of the time, her Poodle was non-stop barking out the window and she would mostly ignore it. The only light she had was a bright as the sun, and there was excess stimulus wherever you looked.\n\nFinally, she was going to take a toke of her joint, but her lighters weren't working anymore. She'd try on, then the other, then another, stand up, walk around, sit down, try all lighters again and repeat. This went on for about 15 mins until I finally discovered this this was the limit of how far I could go just to get laid.\n\nBasically her attention was everywhere else besides me, even though we were the only people in the apartment.\n\nI said that I think she was too much into her own thing, but thanks for having me over anyway, and I left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the bright side, this whole situation made me feel pretty good, as it made me realize that I have my shit together a lot more than I give myself credit for.",

The day that we were supposed to hang out, she said that her sister and her sister's boyfriend were also going to come by. So instead of just the two of us, it would be the four of us.

            "text": "The woman I shall forever call \"The List\"\n\nWhen I got separated from my ex-wife back in July 2007, I took some advice from my best friend at the time: \"date as many people as possible, just whore it up... you've been with the same 2 people your entire life.\"\n\nAfter a month of ZERO interest from dating sites like match, eHarmony and other shitty dating sites, I took a look at my profile.  It was me trying to show my romantic side, trying to post what I thought people wanted to see.  Literally ZERO messages... not even from bots.\n\nSo my friend took my account and wrote it for me.  Under protest,  he told me to \"try it for 2 weeks and see where it goes,\" and that he would change it back if nothing else happened.\n\nThose 2 weeks were insane.  I got so many messages from women thanking me for being brutally honest, not wasting their time and for being confident in myself to say what I wanted, rather than what I THOUGHT I wanted.\n\nI cannot have kids via elective surgery at age 29.  Surprising enough, one of the top comments was \"we aren't necessarily a match, but thanks for being up front about it and not keeping that a secret like so many men do\" - I guess shitty men hide that fact just to have sex?  IDK, but that's lame, if true... don't be *that* guy, guys...\n\nAnyway, back to the topic at hand.\n\nOne of my many dates, I considered a \"bad date\" but ultimately one of the most valuable, was the woman I dub \"The List.\"  We met over Match, and within a few emails, I take it to phone, so I can hear someone if they hesitate or are obviously lying or change their story.  You can edit an email, it's harder to take back words or if you hesitate on a question, etc.  I give her my phone number, she calls me.  We agree to go out for a long walk in West Haven, CT on the boardwalk, and afterwards go out to dinner in Milford at Texas Roadhouse, which just opened.\n\nWe meet up, hug and go for a nice walk. About 3 miles total... was a great time so far.  Chit-chat and small talk, but nothing serious yet.\n\nSo we drive over to Texas Roadhouse and get seated.  The hostess comes by and asks for drinks while we wait, and leaves us with menus.  I go to hand the menu to my date, and I start to say, \"this one's yours,\" meaning the menu is for her... as I kept the other one for myself.  I shit you not, she put one finger up to shush me and said, \"I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought... oh, now I remember.  I'll have a bay breeze, please.\" - I just sat there, and my eyes got wide.  Red flag #1.  I brush it off, though, and thought maybe I was the one wrong here.\n\nSo drinks come, I don't like to partake in drinking during a date because I want my mind clear and focused.\n\nMore small talk about the new restaurant, if she ever gets out to my part of the state, etc.\n\nThe waitress comes by, and we order some basic appetizers and I ask for that nice cinnamon honey whipped butter they have and some bread.\n\nThe waitress smiles at me and walks off, and the look on my date's face was as if I just shit in her pocketbook.\n\nShe takes a deep breath, and says, \"Before we go any further, we need to talk about what I won't tolerate in a man.\"\n\nAnd this is where she takes out a piece of paper, folded about the size of a business card, out of her purse.  My eyebrow goes up on the right side of my face, I can feel it.\n\nAnd then she unfolded it.  And unfolded it again.  And again.  Now she's holding an 8.5x11\" sheet of printed computer paper with 3 columns of traits and qualities she won't tolerate in a relationship.\n\nShe takes a sip, smacks her lips, which is a pet peeve, and begins:\n\n\"Things I deserve or won't put up with.  A man that won't call me before leaving the house, on the road, when he gets to work and on his lunch, when he is about to leave, when he's on the way home, and when he arrives before he comes into the house.\"\n\nShe looks up over the paper at me, sitting there smiling wryly.\n\n\"I won't put up with a man that won't do the shopping without being told.\"  \"A man that won't show me his phone, or bank statement when I ask.\"  \"A man that doesn't want to cuddle every night.\"  \"A man that--\"\n\nI cut her off by clearing my throat and said, most directly, \"I'm sorry, I apologize for cutting you short, but I don't see this going any further.  I value my time, your time and our time in a relationship, but I will not be controlled.  I've been there already, and I've had my heart broken by someone who took advantage of me and my finances.  We should split the drinks and apps, and you can have them when they get here, but this really isn't going to work out.\"\n\nI took my wallet out to take some cash out, and she just had this look of being completely flabbergasted, put off that I even spoke up and folded up her little list and stuck it back into her pocketbook with her stubby fingers and beady eyes.\n\nShe walked by me and said, \"Thanks for wasting my time, and the guy is supposed to pay.\" She barged out, and I pulled an extra $10 out to cover the food.\n\nIt was the first time I ever stood up for myself in that manner, normally I'm waaaaay too chill and just roll with it.  But I realized, right then and there, that the bad dates are probably more valuable than the \"good ones\" that you get to make out with someone.  Bad dates help you refine your dating pool, your focus in what you want, and ultimately who you truly want to be happy with.\n\nAnd from that, and a few more bad dates like that I ended up meeting my ex, and we dated for 10 years before we broke up amicably when she moved to Florida.\n\nBut I wasn't going to be controlled again.  I wasn't going to be put \"in my place\" or have to give up my life or merge bank accounts, or sacrifice my time and space, and my person to satisfy someone else's expectations.  Compromise?  Absolutely.  Give up?  No.  Never lose yourself because of someone else's insecurities.\n\nAnd I've been blessed to really have good dating experiences since.  Thanks, OP, for giving me inspiration to go down this memory lane.",

I bolted. \n\n- had another lady just straight up try to insult me / shit test me for almost two hours. Called me a “hipster douchebag” because I had a slouchy beanie and black rimmed glasses on, berated me being Canadian (she was American), and belittled my drink choice (rye and ginger) as an “old man’s drink”. It went on like that the ENTIRE time. \n\n- caught one lady in a lie on her socials, as she had a boyfriend. She tried to walk it back on the date, saying they broke up. Sure enough, after I didn’t give her what she wanted, she magically was somehow back together with him like I never happened. \n\n- this one is more a second date after we had sex on the first date: she asked me to remove the condom on the second date because it “felt better without” … I said no and left. 3 months later she was shacked up with another dude and knocked up.

Eventually, the mutual friend, who is in the group I'm now hanging out with, gets a call. She proceeds to tell the mutual friend that I have stranded her in a seedy bar full of strangers and I've taken her keys. Yeah, the dumbass left her keys in my car.

Myself working in coffee for years now I grew out of the trend very quickly  and became tired with shallow \"coffee-culture\" that often pretends to include political leanings, opinions, and education that are almost NEVER actually there. The coffee culture crowd likes to convince itself that they are the renaissance artists and influencers of the next age, when really it's all just trend-following.

Anyway, she actually asked to meet up after a week and already had a time and place in mind. I thought \"Wow, someone who actually knows what she wants!\" and I said yes on the spot. We didn't make exact plans what to do (she said we could just come up with stuff on the spot because we were in a big city) and I agreed.\n\nFast forward to that date. I went to the bus and started heading towards the place where we were supposed to meet up. It was a relatively large open space in the middle of the city and I texted her where exactly we'll meet there and how I'll recognize her. About 5 minutes before my bus arrived she started replying that she's waiting near the bus stop. She however didn't tell me what she was wearing but instead told me she's \"the girl standing with two ore more other guys\".\n\nI didn't really get what kind of description that was or who those 'guys' are. I joked if she joined some kind of city tour or how did she end up waiting there with other people. Then she started explaining that her plan for this date was that we would hang out as a group. And the group was her and several guys she met on Bumble and Tinder. I asked her that I probably misunderstood what we're doing here and I thought this was a date, not some kind of meetup. But she just replied that it is a date but it's just with several guys so we can 'compete' for her.\n\nI had no idea what the hell was going on. I just messaged her that I don't get it. She started explaining about some TV show where guys are all into one girl and she would like vote out one guy after another until only one was left. I just starred at the screen for like a minute or so actually contemplating to go to this weird circus shit that was going on here. My bus stopped and I realized I was there. I walked out, I did see a girl standing there with three guys. I don't know if she saw me or not, but I just turned around, walked back onto the bus. I blocked her on Bumble and just kept riding that bus until I was back home.\n\nTLDR: Girl on bumble wanted to re-enacting some kind of TV show with me and other guys where we compete for her.

Then she says she will be right back and asks her friend to entertain me while she's gone.  It was 10 years ago so I dont remember if I actually talked to the friend at all or how much, but what I do remember is the friend asks for my hand, holds it with both her hands, and stares at me silently for what seemed like forever, while I am just smiling awkwardly.  My thoughts are, is she performing some kind of cosmic test on me or something, is she a medium? wtf is this?  Eventually she just gives me back my hand, smiles, and cheerses me and continues her drink.  Then my date comes back, and we leave the bar area and go play foosball and eat and finish our date, no mention of her friend again.  Really weird, don't you think?",

As we are walking to the door, she falls down. I bent down to help her up and notice she reeks of alcohol. Great, this just keeps getting better. \n\nWe sit down and order a couple beers. I excused myself to use the restroom to open the app and see how I could have missed so much. The pics on her profile were at least 10-15 years old, she was bright faced and looked healthy and happy. Well at least I had an out, so I went back to the table. She had already finished her beer and was ordering a second.

You'll meet, you'll either have chemistry or you won't, it'll be out of the way.  It's way worse if you have emotional investment built up from tons of messages/emails.",

Strep is a bacterial infection.

My Instagram is focused not on me - but my love of food and travel and fitness and we had a lot of chats about it all. \n\nWe decide to meet in a gastropub that is half way between us, in the county I live versus the county he lived in or in central london as although I work in the city, he did not. \n\nWhen we get to the restaurant he is scanning the menu and complains everything is really fancy. I’m a bit taken aback as the food is just “elevated” pub grub. Think burgers that are wild boar rather than beef etc. he says he can’t find anything he would like to eat. I point out some of the simpler options and laugh asking him why someone who had eaten at x,y,z restaurant seemed phased by a gastro pub. He just laughed it off and ordered a chicken burger with most of the extras removed. \n\nThe waiter comes over and we banter over a special the chef is trying out of pigeon which I promptly order and my date looks horrified. I ask what’s wrong and he said pigeon sounded gross. \n\nConversation was like blood from a stone and after the waiter drops off starters he asks me if I know the waiter as we have been chatting a lot. I said no not at all, I often banter with waiters. He suggests in his county (10mins away) he never experiences this. I laugh and say yes but you’ve travelled a lot so I’m sure you used to chatting to strangers on your travels. He agrees. \n\nI change the subject ask some more questions but it’s like blood from a stone and in the end I ask him why he’s being weird and has nothing to talk about. He at this point admits he stalked my profile and lied about being to the countries and restaurants I had to impress me. He said he didn’t have a passport, liked eating basic food like Mac & cheese, and being so far from home was making him feel really out of his comfort zone as my county was “so much different to his….” (FYI, we live in U.K. and are ten mins apart - there is no cultural difference between counties here!)\n\nI laughed, having just come back from the Middle East this was so laughable! So I noped out of there. But I don’t share my Instagram with strangers anymore - incase they borrow my life to impress me! \n\n(Just realised this is ask men and I’m not a man… sorry, but too good a story not to share!)",

This is not a small friends party. She had to meet me around the corner because the street and yard was lined with cars. Anyways I figured she just wanted a ride, sort of pissed but wasn’t going to leave her and her school was less than five minutes away and I am about ten minutes away. So at first driving to my place because I have my own apartment and she is in dorms. On the way there she starts passing out, I tell her let me just take you home. She doesn’t want to go there, she goes “you can just have sex with me if I pass out, I give you permission.” \n\nI put less than a hour of back and forth text into this girl and knew her around 5-10 minutes. I pull over because I try to get her to tell me where she wants to go that isn’t my place. I don’t know her, we go to different colleges in same city. I definitely don’t feel like babysitting a trashed girl I don’t know.\n\nSomeone keeps calling her so I answer it and it’s a female. I tell them she is breathing but she keeps passing out and the girl tells me that she was worried about her because she said she was going off with some guy she didn’t know. I was like I’m that guy and I would rather take her home or to someone she know’s house. Girl tells me the dorm and was like I’m her friend I’ll meet you there but I gotta make sure coast is clear to sneak her in because we aren’t supposed to get drunk. I’m like sure. Pull up, wait ten minutes and hope she doesn’t wake and puke. Girl comes down and sees if I can help, we get the girl awake enough to barely walk. I help her to her room with her friend and I hear “come cuddle me” and I said no thanks and just left. Her friend walked me out and on the elevator ride told me she does shit like that all the time. \n\nThe next two days she sent me random messages throughout the day like what you doing, want to hang out, and just random sentences like that.

Day of the date I have a bunch of different things planned and backups option in case she is not interested in certain places, she shows up looking like a goddess. Ends up rejecting all of the stuff I had planned, wants to go out clubbing instead. Don’t normally club or party at that point because I’m focusing on getting my degree, but I think, “what’s the worst that could happen?”. \n\nShe racks up a $700 bill in an hour buying drinks for other people and almost avoiding me, decide to bounce and let the staff know I’m not with her. Get a call from her almost 2 hours later as I’m chilling with a pizza and a movie asking where I was, don’t answer but ask her what she’s doing, apparently she was told she had to pay and she was 100% ready to stick me with the bill. Told her I’m not rich, am not interested in being used like a wallet, and obviously couldn’t afford a night out like that as a student, ended up saying, “so why would you ask me out if she was just going to end up insulting me like that?”. She can’t find an answer and does that whole singing/crying bit to play the victim, and I just tell her not to talk to me again before hanging up. \n\nCut to 2 weeks later, this girl side eyes me longingly ever single time I have to be around her and I’m constantly approached by people asking me stuff for her. Found out from an annoyed girl in that time that was pressured into approaching me that the girl is a spoiled rich kid and that her parents own a really huge company, immediately say that it explains a lot and that I’m sorry she was pressured into the situation. I get a knock on my door and the RA says I need to come to the dorm office because someone is looking for me, which immediately has red flags written all over it as the look on his face is almost laughing. As soon as I get in the room, I’m greeted by the nerdy looking old guy and another slightly younger guy in fancy cloths is just sitting there. Immediately am asked what I did to his daughter, so I told him everything that happened and that I wanted to go because the situation was really awkward. Instead of letting me go he starts asking me how much I would need to take his daughter on dates per week and that he would pay double that, I go to get up to leave and he says he will buy me an apartment and keeps offering more money just because he’s trying to make his crazy daughter happy. Tell him no and that this whole situation is creepy, then I file a report with the university and my RA about what is going on because at that point I’m seriously freaked out. Get a package in the mail with $5k saying sorry for the inconvenience and to buy myself something nice, girl still side eyes me all the time but I’m left alone. Was one of the creepiest things I’ve ever dealt with as a regular looking guy, I’m not going to ruin my future to be a play toy for a psycho rich kid",

Lectured me about what women need for 5 minutes. \n\nSaid thanks for the coffee and dipped. 4 months later landed a gig that pays $85k. Eat shit lady.",

She's really nice!\"\n\nI like girls, and the GF is smoking hot, so I'm like \"Let's do it!\"\n\nSo we go in his car and meet them at a place just off of base that he says has cheap on tap beer and great live music. I love music, especially live music and I love cheap beer, so this should be great.  Then we get there.\n\nNot a fan of country western music. Just not my thing.  If you like it, great.  but he knew i didn't.  Whatever, I'm in a midst of a dry-spell so hey, try something different, right?  His GF is hot. Her cousin is...not bad. Something's off, I can't put a finger on it right away, other than she kinda looks like she grabbed whatever was closest on the floor to wear. Nothing really matched, and she looked more appropriate for cleaning the attic or garage than going out. \n\nOkay, you know what, he says she's really nice.  We'll have a conversation, and see what happens.   Apparently the girls had been there for a half hour before we got there. We ordered a fresh pitcher of beer.  The girls had already been through two of them.  Well the cousin had.  The GF was on her second glass.\n\nWhen we leave - which wasn't long, because the cousin got into it with a bartender that cut her off, we're going to head to a beach party the GF was invited to.  He's driving the GF and he hands me the keys to his truck so I can follow and \"get to know\" the cousin.\n\nNot 2 minutes into the drive she starts drunk crying because she really wanted to meet me, but now she's drunk and a mess and I'm going to hate her and she really think I'm hot and wants to fuck me, but she needs to stop fucking guys on the first date because she doesn't want people to think she's a slut anymore so she can't fuck me, but she really wants to so she might if I promise to tell people that we didn't fuck, but they're going to know because she always gets horny when she gets drunk and she always fucks guys on the first date and she's a horrible slut but she doesn't want to be a slut so she can't fuck me, but maybe if I was her boyfriend and would stick around then it would be okay and then we could fuck and I could spend the night and she'd make breakfast and then we could fuck in the morning because she's always wanted to fuck after a pancake breakfast, but does that make her a slut...\n\nAnd this stream-of-consciousness drunk-crying goes on for the ENTIRE 20 minute drive to the party. i literally only got a few words in to tell her \"No I didn't think she was a slut\" and \"No she didn't have to sleep with me on the first date.\" and \"It was okay, and I didn't hate her\"\n\nShe stopped crying the moment we got there and she perked up smiling because there was an open keg.  She ran to it like a three year old to a plate of cookies, smiling and giggling the whole time. Then she ran to the lake, got out of her clothing to skinnydip as a few other people were and wanted me to get naked and come in the water too. I declined.  \"If we're both skinny dipping and you accidentally fucked me, it would be okay.\" \n\nTwo points.\n\nI have never seen a grown woman fo from fully dressed to fully nude at the speed to which she got naked.  If there was a video-game type skill at getting naked, she had taken several perks in speed stripping.\n\nAs a 20ish year old guy, having an attractive naked woman tell you to take off your clothing so you could \"accidentally fuck\" is one of the hardest things I have ever had to think about in my life.\n\nI still declined and told her with as drunk as she was, going in the water was a bad idea. So of course she started crying again about how I didn't want to fuck her because she was such a slut.\n\nI took the naked drunken crying girl to her cousin, handed her the clothing, turned to my buddy and told him I was leaving and taking his truck. The GF told me she'd make sure he got back to base and apologised. \"She gets like this when she drinks.  You should come over tomorrow during the day.  She's really great when she's sober.\"\n\nI left. I did not come over the next day. Or any other day.  My buddy kept telling me that the cousin kept asking about me.  Wanted me to come over because I \"hadn't fucked her so I must be a great guy\".  Eventually my buddy took a different guy from the unit to meet the cousin.  She sent me a letter through my buddy to tell me she fucked the other guy, and she only fucked him to make me jealous because she wanted me and included a bunch of naked polaroids \"to show me what I was missing\".",

He was also much much bigger than in his photos which I didn’t mind as much but didn’t strike me as very honest. When I say bigger I mean like what Americans call morbidly obese I think. He could walk around but he was very very big.\n\nWe’d met in the main sort of hipstery bars and restaurants street in town as we couldn’t seem to agree on somewhere to go for some reason while chatting from the app. I now wonder if it was because of his worrying about his size and being in those places and I feel for him if that was why.\n\nI suggested in the end that we just meet there at this landmark at one end of the street and pick somewhere. He made snobby derisive comments about everywhere I suggested and chose a very loud, crowded pizza place. We went in and it was very casual, which was weird after the snobby comments about other places. I felt like it was all a bit off. I sat through quite a while of lecture time before I suggested we order. He said he’d order for me, which I was a bit surprised about, but before I could answer he said “you’re not vegetarian are you? Vegetarians are retarded”. I am, unfortunately, a vegetarian.\n\nI laughed it off and he doubled down and said that I was uneducated about food and nutrition. I considered saying something about another lecture or something snarky but I just thought better of it. I said I’m sorry, he didn’t seem to be having a very good time and we should probably just leave it there. I got up and walked out.\n\n I met up with some friends and we ended up going out drinking after we’d met for dinner so I didn’t see my phone until the next day.

M while staring daggers at the waitress says, \"Um yea, you can get me a gin & tonic you fucking janitor.\".  I just sat there in awe.

It was one of the best concert experiences of my life. I say I wish I was with them instead of this terrible date and my old friend invites me up with him.

I told her to check the bathroom (she just came out) she literally called me a \"retard\" for suggesting that.  Began dumping her purse on the bar floor and threw her coat on the ground too.  Yelling at everyone there to help her.  I finally convinced her to check the bathroom and apologized to everyone there explaining it was the first time I had ever met her and was super embarrassed.  They all laughed and said it was entertaining.  She came back with her oh one which she of course left in the bathroom and that's when she started talking about hooking up.  I politely declined and she blew up and that is when she started offering BJ's to random patrons.  She agreed to not drive and was looking desperately for a ride... ended up calling her ex.  Once I knew she had a safe ride, I said peace and dipped out.  The whole ride home I was getting texts that I read back at my apt telling me how awful and ugly I was and that she hoped I \"fucking died in a ditch\".  She had 3 drinks.  I text back and said she was the most embarrassing person to be around, incredibly rude and I hope she has a nice life but don't contact me in the future. \n\nShe txt me back the next day apologizing and saying she understood.  Apparently she just got new medication and wasn't supposed to drink anything on it.  I replied that that made sense and accepted her apology and it was sorta just left off at that until about a year later I ran into her at a bar.  She claimed to not recognize me when I said hello, but clearly just embarrassed.  I kinda felt bad for her.\n\n\nTLDR; date got super drunk off 3 drinks, had mental breakdown about losing her phone in bar, offered to suck off anyone at the bar for a ride home, called her ex to pick her up, i dipped, she wished me dead, turned out her new medication + alcohol don't mix well.",

Her profile was very well written; a mix of intellectual and self-deprecating. Her pictures were attractive and she was very stylish.  I wasn't available for a bit, so we exchanged long, well-written, thought-provoking questions.  Well, we finally agree to meet at a bar near her place.\n\nShe doesn't show.  I don't have her number, so I message her through the app a few times.  Just as I'm about to leave, I get a push notification. She swears she thought it was tomorrow or next weekend or whatever.  Okay, understandable.  She apologizes profusely and says she'll be right over since she lives only a block or two away. Okay.\n\nWell, she shows up about 10 - 15 minutes later...and she's a mess.  Dirty, wrinkled clothes, bed-hair, and um...she smells.  Noticeably bad.  Like I can smell her B.O. from across the table bad.  I offer to let he take a shower and get ready and meet back up in an hour, since there's a bookstore nearby I could browse around in and grab a coffee.  She declines.  \n\nTo make up for it, she offers to pay for some ridiculously expensive Scotch for both of us and pulls out a massive wad of bills, mostly hundreds.  I'd say it was close to $4000.  O....kay.\n\nOur waiter comes by, and she blatantly leers at the bulge in his crotch.  I thought I was seeing things at first, but her further behavior confirms that it was exactly what I saw.  She's completely scatter-brained and can't focus on anything I'm saying and she's constantly changing subjects and telling me inappropriate anecdotes about the penises of all the d-list celebrities she's fucked.  I've never been around someone on cocaine, but I've heard it's like.\n\nI'm trying to think of a way out of this mess when she leaves a hundred on the table and asks to go for a walk.  Okay, sure.  Whatever.  It will be easier to break it off on the street.  She latches on to my arm and holy fuck, she fucking smells like ass.  She stops in front of a bar and I'm preparing my \"Uh, gotta go!\" speech when she drags me inside.  It's a strip club.  She grabs another dancer who seems surprised to see her.  Apparently she had gotten fired the other day and was banned from the premises.  She gives the other dancer a $100 to grab some stuff she left behind in the dressing room.  Dancer comes back with a backpack and then I hear some angry old lady, the owner, yelling.  \"HEY, I FUCKIN' TOLD YOU NEV-AH COME BACK HERE, YA FUCKIN' CUNT!\"  The massive bouncer had been distracted and starts making his way over to us, murder in his eyes.\n\nOh lord.  I duck out and my date latches on to my arm laughing hysterically.  I tell her I have to go.  She looks like she's about to cry and begs me to say.  I insist on leaving.  She crudely and bluntly offers me a blowjob if I don't leave.  I'm trying to pry her fingers off my arm when her phone rings.  It's one of her friends, and she just hooked up with two rich Kuwaiti dudes and she needs another girl for a foursome, and it will pay quite handsomely.\n\nShe asks if it's okay if she takes it.  I strongly encourage her to go get that hustle and walk away as fast as possible.",

Trying to figure out what to do next, suggest walking around town to grab a bite, etc. SHE suggests “or we could go to this bar with my roommate and to a ton of cocaine” I’m like, why a ton? Why is that your default amount? \n\nSo I don’t really do any drugs, maybe smoke weed like once every six months. We start talking about how she likes to party. She talks about all the stuff she does. THEN CASUALLY MENTIONS THE ONE THING SHE WANTS TO TRY IS SMOKING CRACK. I say what the fuck, that’s insane. She says, why does everyone always act like I’m crazy when I say that? Wtf. \n\nThen I just picked up my laptop and left. She was pretty pissed and started texting me insults.

First place we go to is actually where I met my current wife at. The first thing she says before I order drinks is “I bet I can drink you under the table.” She’s like 5’5 maybe 130 pounds and I’m 6’4 280. I’m like “Ok?” just totally confused.  I ordered us shots and then she kept ordering round after round. By now she’s slurring and I’m still sober. She says let’s go to the next bar. I call an Uber to a super divey bar. She says “What drink gets you fucked up?”\n\nFour horsemen is the first that comes to mind. She orders a couple of rounds and by now she’s trashed. She falls off the bar stool and drags me down with her to the ground. I’m looking up and the bartender leans over and says “Do y’all want another round?” “Naw we’re good.” I call another Uber and she says let’s go back to my place. We get to her place and first thing she starts taking all her clothes off. As soon as I start to take off my pants, she collapses on the bed and begins snoring, loud.\n\n I pull my pants back up, creep out the front door and get a ride home. The next day I wake up to a text “Why the fuck did you leave last night asshole?” Block delete.",

Everything was going great and the date was nearing an end and I'm going to drop her back at her place. So we're sitting in my car and she's like \"I love you, we can date as long as you don't mind my partner.\" And I was like 'wtf you're in a relationship?' then she says \"no my business partner\" at this point I think she's talking about a pimp or something but I still have a dumbfounded look on my face. So then she straight up tells me she wants to marry me. She wants a green card and only had 2 months left in the country and she wants to marry me ASAP. And if I want to date her that's fine, but she'll marry someone else. You ever have that feeling where you feel like an anchor is tied to your soul and someone just threw it overboard? That's how I felt. I wasnt mad, I just completely disconnected and became distant because I thought the whole date was great and meaningful but it was just a con. Looked at her, whispered 'get out', and just floored it out of there.",

I tell her to meet me at a local park, with the plan of six pack of beer, blanket, Star gazing. Seemed like she was into, and it’s honestly a very popular park so well lit and not as creepy as it sounds while I’m typing. Somehow we talk about taking one car, so I meet her at Ymca, im sitting at my car and she pulls up saying “hey my baby daddy’s got the little shit for 2 hours,” in a joking matter, so I said “perfect I got all night before my parole officer checks in.” She laughs, we hop in car and drive to park. She brings up sexual stuff on the drive. And like, I tried some shit, so I was ready to explore whatever she’s talking about. Starts off “light.” Simple stuff like being choked and guy in control, so sure I can do that. Then she says she likes calling her man daddy and asking for permission, jokingly I say “well you can call me father,” which she took as making fun of her instead of joking — to be honest, I’m not into the daddy thing so maybe I laid it a bit thick. \n\nThen the stuff started coming out that’s not your average “rough sex.” Cutting, pissing, humiliating. Again, each to their own, but first date on the drive to the date location is a weird flex to say “I like being pissed on and humiliated.” Get to the park, lay the blanket out for about 15 minutes. Didnt even open the beer… shit it was still in the car because I purposefully left it. Asked if she wanted to head back to the car, she said sure, thinking we were doing something else after all the sex talk. Got in, drive her to her car, said “well I had a lovely evening,” and she hopped back in her car. I was blocked before I even got home.",

We’d never really talked, but she was cute, whatever\n\nSo we meet for dinner and it’s kinda awkward and forced, but nothing too freaky. I was picking up some weirdness, but I figure it’s just nerves. \n\nNow, this was a few years back, but I’m probably older than most of you guys here so I was already full on Mike Gundy (I’m a man! I’m 40!) And I looked 40. I looked 40 when I was 20. No baby face here.\n\nThe drinks come and she goes, “So I’m wondering if you’re into younger women?” \n\nThis has me thinking maybe she’d never gotten a clear look at me at the diner and she thought I was younger? Because SHE’S younger? Maybe she has a daddy kink or something? But she looks at least 35-40 to me. Like I don’t have wrinkles and shit and she does. \n\nI don’t really get it, so I say, “Well… I dunno, why do you ask?”\n\n“I’m wondering if you’d be interested in my niece?”\n\nNow I’m totally confused. Turns out her niece is 20! She says she took my photo at the diner and sent it to her niece and she’s into me. \n\nNow this shit is sounding really twisted, but I’m like dumbfounded. Im having coherent thoughts, but nothing is actually coming out of my mouth. Probably look like a landed bass. \n\nSo she keeps going. She extols a few of her nieces virtues and then shows me her picture. The niece looks like a baby. Like maybe it’s her 5th grade picture or something. I got a little freaked, but I’m thinking no way is the niece 20.\n\nSo I’m still speechless, but now I realize it’s some kind of joke. I look at the photo, then look at this woman for the punchline, but she’s just looking back at me. Some moments pass and I go, “that girl isn’t 20.”\n\nShe says, “20!”\n\nSo now I’m trying to figure out a way to escape that will still allow me to have pancakes a couple days a week. This shit is surreal, but nothing too serious has occurred. I say, “oh, sorry. I thought YOU wanted to have a date.”\n\n“Ohh… no, Im married.” Shows me her ring. “I want to find a husband for my niece.”\n\n“But Im twice her age?” (And maybe more, judging by the pic)\n\nSo now im waiting for the cameras to come out and say I’ve been punked, or the catch a predator guy to arrest me or something. But nothing happened. She just shrugged, sipped her drink and started looking through her phone. I dropped a 20 on the table and bailed. Never went back to the diner.",

Anyway, we walk by a riverboat and she wants to go in and see the gift shop. Eventually we walk upstairs where it’s empty and she sits down on a couch. I join her and she proceeds to ask me to rate the date on a scale of 1-10. I’m like “really?” And she said something like “to ensure quality customer service, we value your feedback.” I tell her I haven’t been on many since my divorce so I couldn’t really compare it. So then she asks me to “rate your date’s appearance on a scale of 1-10.” Dude…I’m not falling for that shit. I tell her she’s making me uncomfortable. She drops it. Then she gets a texts and seems on the verge of a breakdown. Apparently her ex texted her about their daughter.

Earlier in the week I mentioned to her that I wasn’t feeling good. She hit me with the first red flag. She said something along the lines that it’s funny I’m feeling sick. I told her that I wanted to go out it was just that I wasn’t feeling well and that I wanted her to know so that she wasn’t blindsided. \nShe cooled off and we continued talking during the week. Sexual chemistry was building between us and I was excited to see her.\nRemember when I was feeling well, I decided to go to an urgent care, where I was diagnosed with bronchitis and another red flag.\nGuess who got upset again cause I was changing are plans. She got pretty upset with me and thought I was lying. I almost took a photo of my diagnosis!  Again, she sees that I’m not lying and change plans to meet up the following Saturday. Deal!\nWe talked on a daily basis throughout the week where she mentioned that she was trying to cut back on her drinking. Great! It’s a good thing to be healthy. Again, Saturday came around and we met at a movie theater.  Great first impression and we were definitely into each other.\nMovie ended and we both had separate plans after the movie but made plans to hang out again. \nLater that night I was tired and was just getting in bed. This girl calls me, drunk as hell, tells me to come meet up with her. I decline while I’m laying in bed and she hits me with the “how much nookie would i have to give you to get you to come out.” With that I’m magically dressed. \nShe hands the phone off to a friend who gives me the address to a house party. I drive the 40mins to the party.\nNow it’s a house party, I always walked in, did I know these people? No. Was I temporarily blinded by nookie? Absolutely. Did I think I was making a terrible decision? No. \nI decided to walk straight in and this big, meaty pit Bull goes ballistic. Now I’m just kinda in the entryway frozen cause I don’t want to get bit. Then I hear what made this situation worse.\n“WHO the FUCK is this guy?!?”\n“I’m commenter and I’m here to see Bumble girl.”\n“So you just walk into someone’s house without knocking?”\n“It’s a house party, and I thought you guys wouldn’t hear me.”\n“Your lucky, I’m a shoot first ask questions later kinda guy”\nYou’re cool buddy. I didn’t say that.\n\nThe homeowner settles down and finally invites me in. I’m committed to the nookie at this moment. As I’m sitting very awkwardly on the couch, his friend is side eyeing me. He told me “you got some balls dude.” I didn’t say that I was blinded.\nNow the dog still wasn’t liking me. This meaty fella was just glaring at me like, “do something, bitch! I dare you.” I’m not getting bit, so I sat there.\n\nIf you made it this far you may be wondering, where’s Bumble girl? Well someone who was trying watch their drinking has passed out in the 40min drive… Her friends, go to the back room, as I’m getting interrogated, and wake her up. She comes stumbling into the living room, continues to stumble into the kitchen, she then turns around goes straight back to the bedroom.  She was so far gone that she never acknowledged me. Looks like no nookie for me.\nHer friends then go back a second time and try to wake her and fail. They come out and tell me that she’s not waking up and I need to leave. I agreed and bounced.

After graduating, we started flirting online, sometimes bordering on sexting. She was in the Peace Corps previously, and I sent her a few care packages, including candy and such they didn't have in her host country. Since we both came from the same hometown, we'd go on dates when we were both home. We kissed a few times, and it felt lovely.\n\nThen we started making plans to meet up in her current city across the country.  The light sexting was part of the planning. The plan was to go to her city, hang out, have sex, etc. This was all very, very clear, though to be honest I should have gone in without expectations... On the other hand she ordered one hotel room for us with one bed. \n\nI landed, she picked me up, we had dinner, we went back to the hotel room. I tried initiating sex, and she suddenly got very hesitant and decided to completely leave the hotel. I was so surprised and felt so skeezy. I told her she should absolutely do what she was comfortable with,  but that I felt I was brought out there on false pretenses. \n\nFor some dumb reason we decided to hang out the next day since I flew all the way out there. At dinner, she brought a friend of hers, and I guess I told some jokes my \"date\" didn't like, and I didn't realize until later in a cab. I apologized and said I meant no offense at all. I had no idea what I was saying was coming across as hurtful.\n\nThe kicker was when we went to a show after dinner. We tried talking, but it felt like everything I said, she either outright mocked or wholly waved away, even full on deriding me for answers I gave to her questions. It was just plain mean. No playfulness, just pure spite.\n\nThis escalated for a few minutes, until she started mocking me as a person. Just blatantly mean shit. I felt myself getting hot. Then, I took twenty bucks out of my wallet (she'd paid for the drinks and the tickets to the show), slapped the money on the table, and said, \"Seeya next time I'm around.\" And walked out.

Ive never been interested in driving and transport isn’t a massive issue from here to there so I dealt with it.\n- it was a massive expenditure though and it was entirely one sided.\n\nAfter about a year into the relationship I found my own place in my city, it was pretty cheap and nasty but it was mine. I told her from day one if she wanted to get out from under her parents feet she should move in with me, I wouldn’t ask for rent or bills just help putting food on the table.\n\nAround this time she felt it was necessary to constantly berate and belittle me in front of everyone she knew, she had befriended *my* family, who I’ve never been close to, and would call them up to drive her from her parents to mine \n\n- she was working full time at this point so she really could have afforded the cost of travel and she wasn’t paying any overheads.\n\nShe would shout at me in front of her friends and apologise for how I was acting, kind of lol in hindsight, worst of all she had put a significant wedge in between me and my friends. She hated the fact that I was friends with *any* females, so would openly talk shit about my best friends wife to anyone that would listen - literally turned an entire group of people against someone they would never even meet.\n\nThere were two specific incidents which made me walk out and then cut her out entirely.\nAs a preface, she had trauma dumped a significant amount of times during our relationship, she had told me how multiple ex’s had hit her or slapped her during arguments.\n\nWe were staying at her parents house while they were away and she got really pissy about what should be watched on TV, we argued and went to bed - about 10PM. I lie awake for about 5 hours unable to sleep because I was so miserable. At about 3AM she makes an overly dramatic gesture to put her arm over me while she was “sleeping”, when I turned away from her she got up and started the argument again, full hysteria.\nShe started to kick and punch me, spat in my face and called me pathetic, really tried to goad me into punching her back which I didn’t, when she realised that she wasn’t getting what she wanted she stood in the kitchen and smashed a stainless steel kettle so hard and repetitively on the counter top that she broke it apart.\nI left when it got light and got the train home.\n\n A week or so later she called me complaining about how difficult living with her mother was, I told her what I’d say nearly 2 years prior, even after assaulting me and spitting in my face I told her she could move in with me rent free, she told me she wanted to stay at home so she could go out with her friends every night. I laughed, Told her she was perpetuating the awful situation and told her to go fuck herself \nThen blocked her.\n\nAbout a year later I received an 10 page hand written letter in the mail, I didn’t read it - gave it to my friends to laugh at.\n\nI’m pretty sure she’s suckered some poor shmuck into a relationship now and is bleeding him just like she did me and many others.\n\nI’m now married with a kid so I couldn’t give a shit what that fucking cunt does in her life.\n\n**PSA IF THERES RED FLAGS ON DAY ONE - DONT WAIT UNTIL DAY 1000 TO STAND UP FOR YOURSELF**",

            "text": "Met her at one of my buddies beach house (really really pretty) , and we started talking from there. (While being there she took one of my favorite hats from me *this will be important later on*) About a week later ask her on a date. She said yes and I decide to just take her to a nice bakery for some dessert while we jus sat and got to know each other. About 10 minutes in I noticed she had been on her phone practically the whole time and she would give me one word responses as she was quite clearly occupied with a separate conversation. Next thing I know her friend (who I also had previously met at the beach house) shows up with some other friend of theirs who was their “bestie”. So at this point I’m just sitting there while the three of them are having a conversation for about 25 minutes, meanwhile I’m just playing the violin. I finally looked at her and gave her a look of “I’m about to just leave” and her friend noticed too. Her friend then says “ok sooo I’m gonna go now do you want me to take you home?” And she paused, thought about it then said no it’s ok. Once her friends finally left I instantly get the tab and tell her that I am dropping her off home. She agreed and then the night was over.\n\n(Apologize if it is too long but it gets worst lol and I like explaining with detail haha) \n\nI obviously don’t really text her back and a week goes by and she texts me “did you forget about me?” I told her that I wasn’t really happy about how that date went down and figured if she cared enough she would apologize or be the first to instigate a conversation. She then said some bullshit about how she was “sick” so she wasn’t talking to anyone and blah blah blah. She asked me to go out on another date and that it would be better because she had “no idea my friend was gonna show up randomly”. I reluctantly agreed to go on another date and give her another shot as I believe everyone deserves a second chance. \n\nFast forward to the second date I decided I was going to take her to a nice restaurant for some drinks and good food. Considering this I decided to uber (drink responsibly) and so I picked up from her house. I of course was waiting outside to open the door for her and she got in and then sat in the window seat. Seemed she did not wan to move so I closed the door and went around and sat at the other window seat …great start right? We get to the restaurant and she instantly orders the most expensive cocktails there and basically keeps them coming. We get the food and she finally started opening up a bit, but I could tell she was still holding back a lot as to kind of try and keep me there. Anyhow, she went to the restroom and I really contemplated paying for everything and leaving, so I went to reach for my wallet and it’s not there. I start panicking a bit maybe I dropped it during the start of this night but then I remembered I literally left it in the nightstand. So I quickly call my cousin and ask him to drop it off and sure enough he was a wonderful person and dropped it off, he even offered to take me home as I let him know how it was all going lol. I declined, he left and then I payed the pretty hefty bill. She then said “I want dessert, but not from here I’ll show you a really nice place.” Again, I reluctantly said sure thinking “maybe she will pay since it’s her idea” and so we went. We get there and she orders for herself, does not recommend me anything then sits down to eat. The cashier looks at me so once again I pull out my wallet and pay. That basically was the last straw so I told her I’d like to take her home and call it a night and for her to return me my hat when I dropped her off. We get an Uber and again I open the door for her, same thing. Halfway through she asks me “why are you sitting so far away?” I was just beyond done with the night so scooted in closer because the vibes were just very awkward. We get to her house so I scoot back to my door so I can get out and then open hers, she instantly grabs my hand and pretty much yells “why are you getting out you don’t have to” really fast. I was caught off guard, and so I say “I was just gonna open the door for you..” She then just like orders me “STAY HERE” and so she goes into her house (it has a gate) and then a few minutes later she comes back says I don’t feel like walking back out but I had a good time, throws my hat over the gate and then walks away. I pick it up from the ground get in the Uber, the driver looks at me, I look at him and apologize and then he says, “women”. \n\nI never message her 2 weeks later she messages me again same shit “why didn’t you ever text me back, why are you ghosting me” I just never replied. Saw her months later at University and of course still asks me to hang out again. \n\nLater I find out my one of my closest friends  had slept with her when he saw me talking to her at Uni. Never talked to her after that.",

I joked and said \"well what about films like Jurassic Park, Shawshank Redemption, Goodfellas?\", mentioning bands, tv shows, songs, artists from the last 30 years.\n\nNo. To this girl, her cultural experience ended Dec 31st 89 and she started really arguing, causing a scene in this bar, involving other people off other tables to try and bolster her argument all the while looking more and more unhinged. And it wasn't like she was drunk because it was literally the first drink. I said I think I'm gonna leave, went for the exit. She followed me and tried desperately to do the end of date kiss, as if that would make it all better. I shook her hand and left.\n\nThere is an awkward follow up to this story too, this is around 6 months later. My brother and I went on a week's vacation to Rhodes, both of us were in need of some sun and relaxation. We'd booked at one of those all inclusive resorts, all you can eat and drink places. I'd spotted this pretty red head staring at me whilst having my evening meal in the hotel restaurant but thought no more of it.\n\nMy brother and I would get a table and have a few drinks each night, I mean, free bar, why wouldn't you. My brother went to get the next round of drinks and I hear someone shouting my name. I look around. Still my name being called. It's this big middle aged guy with a beard. I look at him and gesture \"me?\" \"yeah you!\" and he waves me over.\n\nI walk over to this middle aged couple sat there with their family and the guy says \"remember her?\"......aaaaand it was my date. From 6 months ago. I mean, the odds of it happening must have been astronomical but there we were in the same hotel, in the same resort at the same time, like something from a crap Adam Sandler film. So her dad pipes up and says \"so why was there no second date?\" and my drunken mind is trying to search for any answer other than \"because your daughter is an argumentative psycho\" and I'm stuck and I can see her enjoying watching me be uncomfortable with it all. At which point my brother shows up with my drink \"HEEEEEY! this is my brother, we're on holiday together, best be going now, bye!\" and walked off.

We went for a walk, the conversation was good, she offered me a swig, we finished it and decided to get dinner. She drank a lot during dinner and got very flushed, split the check. She wanted to go to a bar after and I figured why not (she had walked to meet me and lived nearby, I lived thirty minutes away) I couldn't drive anyway at this point, and thought I might end up going home with her as she was displaying interest.  As soon as we got to the bar I went to the bathroom, and came back to her flirting with another dude heavily. I asked the bartender if she knew the guy, he said it was her ex. I called a buddy who picked me up, took me to in n out and put me to sleep in their bed while they slept on their couch because I was drunk snoring so fucking loud.",

            "text": "Oddly enough, I should have seen it coming.\n\nThis was years ago, I would have been about 22. Met a girl, funny, independent, caring, smart, thoughtful... she was very attractive. She was also a swimsuit model for rip-curl. Tall, aquiline features, amazing figure, great conversationalist, seemed genuine and seemed to be genuinely nice. We got on really well, had chemistry + common interests and a pretty similar outlook on life. So I asked her on a date, ofc.\n\nQue the date: went and had a simple restaurant dinner (somewhere in town, I can't remember the name of the place). She was a talented conversationist, her and I just clicked. Had one of the most fun, easygoing and stimulating conversations I've ever had with another human being. Got invited back to her place, yeah you bet. (I owned a nice car, so I offered to collect her for the date and she accepted. When I arrived to collect her she was waiting outside) Turned up and she asks me to be quiet, turns out she lives at mum & dads. OK, no biggie, she was 2 odd years younger than me, sometimes home is the best place, no judgement here.\n\nWe sit down in her lounge (2 storey house and she was in the bottom storey) and have another 2 hour long conversation that was amazing, and before I can make a move she initiates our first kiss. No arguments here, I thought by this stage with the chemistry we had and the way we agreed on the basics of life that I had found me the perfect lady. Then she ~~drags me~~ (oops, I meant \"takes me by the hand\", I would have followed her anywhere at this point) to her room, and jumps me. \n\nAfterwards we were sitting on the couch in the lounge watching TV and chatting, again it all just worked for me. There's a knock on the door, it's a dude about my age. He's introduced as the neighbour, but there's something in his attitude that's not quite right. (I should point out here that I'm an adult with Asperger's and I miss obvious social queues). He stays for an hour, we don't really talk about anything, it's a 3 way conversation, but a strange one. I used the bathroom and when I came back he was leaving. I got ready to go (about 2 minutes after he left) and commented on the strangeness of the situation; it went like this:\n\n\"That guy is a bit odd. have you known him very long? Is he a good mate?\"  \n\"Yeah, I've known him for years. He was angry\"\n\n\"Oh? Was it something I said?\"\n\n\"Nah, he just told me not to fuck you\"\n\n\"Um why?\" (I still didn't see it, I was a bit thick I think lol)\n\n\"Because he's my boyfriend\"\n\n...I told her that we would not be a thing because she was already in a relationship and left. I was fucked up pretty badly by that for a long time, as much for what happened afterwards as what happened that night. I just don't get stuff like that happening to me as a rule, So I really had no coping strategy for it. She wasn't perfect (no one is, me included) but she was the closest to perfect for me that I've ever met. I could have handled a lot of strangeness from her for the amount of connection we obviously had, but not that.\n\nShe tried to contact me a couple of times over about a month after that, but by then I had spoken to mates who knew the BF, apparently this was a thing she had done several times in their 3 year relationship, so I never replied. Last time was a message from a shared mate about 3 months later and it was \"I'm single now, please call me\".\n\nI didn't, could only assume what she did to the BF would have happened to me as well. I met the BF again more than a year after that and explained what happened, told him I'd rejected her firmly when I found out about him and apologised for the whole thing. He just said \"She never stopped talking about you\" and walked off. That was a mindfuck.\n\nStill don't think that, all these years later, I really understood what was really going on in that situation.",

One of the guys in the group was really hot. Like really.\n\nWhen the first bar closes, we all go to another one. At some point, my friends say they want to leave. Hot guy asks me to stay for a drink. I wasn’t really sure because the metro closed at 2 am and it was like midnight already, but my friends convinced me to give it a try.\n\nAs soon as my friends left, the guy told me to order a drink and got up. He was on his phone, said another friend was arriving and left the bar. I waited there like 10 min. Nothing. Then I went out and the guy was there, not far away. He said sorry, the friend is taking longer. Like I said, guy was really hot, so I stayed.\n\nAnother 10 min go by, guy is still outside. I start walking to leave. The guy tells me “ok, it isn’t a friend, we ordered coke and we’re waiting for the dealer”. And immediately after he says that, I see two of the other guys from his group opening a supermarket bag and splitting the contents. Hot guy went there, I left.\n\nI was walking towards the metro, hot guy followed me and said “ok, I will walk you to the metro”. When we’re at the metro station, he tries to convince me of going home with him. Of course I went back home.\n\nNext day, I get a text from him “sorry about last night”, to which I replied “it wasn’t what I was expecting when you asked me to stay”.",

            "text": "This is what I get for dating my Lyft passenger. I ignored a United Nations worth of red flags.\n\n(RED FLAG 1) Upon my arrival (as her Lyft), she has 2 guys helping her with a bunch of her stuff. I become helper 3; this is my job and I need the $. (2) Turns out she is moving crosstown, so it takes 10-15 minutes to get everything in. (Anyone who tried me like this now, I’d light it all on fire.) \n\nI assume the guys are her friends. When we’re finally ready to go, she tells me she doesn’t know them, and in fact (3) “the black guy was just hanging out by the pool doing nothing, so I got him to help.” I ignore all this b/c she is a hot Russian and Japanese chick. (Also, I’m spite-rebounding from another girl toying with me.)\n\nTraffic is horrible PM rush hour, and my Prius is full with her crap so that I can barely see. But she flirts with me for the 90 minute ride. She eventually asks me (4) where my second car is, since she hears all Uber/Lyft drivers have one. I do think “Um, what?”, but whatever, concentrate on driving. She does mention (5) her dad doesn’t know that she’s moving. \n\nGet her number. I plan the date over the next few days at a famous invite-only spot I managed to get. She flirts more, including with a cutesy suggestive selfie.\n\nI get a Lyft and pick her up; I didn’t want to drive. She makes a fuss about untangling her necklace in the back, which is not my forté—to the point that she asks the driver to do it as he’s driving. She basically acts like a 8 year old with ADD the whole ride. Thank God the driver was cool; I tipped him well. The danger flags were a-whippin’ at gale force. \n\nThe date spot has the background that you pose against to take pictures, like the Oscars, Grammys, nonprofit events, etc. I wanted a pic with her, so I took her hand. She dropped it immediately: “You’re not my boyfriend.” \n\nWhile she was posing like a future trophy wife there, I told her I was miserable and that she could find her own way home. She looked at me blankly and said that was fine, like she expected it. That was after 20 minutes there and like $85. \n\nMoral: Don’t date your Lyft/Uber passengers, even if you’re feeling thirsty.",
