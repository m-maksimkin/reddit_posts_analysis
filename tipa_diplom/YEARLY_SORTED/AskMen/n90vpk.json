Thursday came around and we were chatting on Facebook, when she said \"so who else is coming?\" Being naïve I responded with \"I thought it'd just be us?\"\n\nShe said \"what, LOL, no!

I’d go to dance bars and hope to get lucky.. 99.9% rejection rate and I’ll admit I wasn’t exactly photogenic, well built or confident and 0 EQ at the bar scene, and not white(doesn’t mean I’m black).  But the feelings were real.. I saw this one girl across the dance bar and she looked like , I kid you not, an Emma Watson doppelgänger. I asked her for a dance and she gave me this look of disgust and I felt like I wanted to disappear. But later on she felt guilty or something and decided to come dance with me. There’s plenty of times when women just look with disgust at me when I approach them.. it hurts especially when you on the other hand think wow what an angel!! \nTo increase my confidence talking to women, I decided to spend $40 on dollar dances at local strip clubs EVERY week .. I kid you not, this one stripper went all out French kissing me when she realized I hadn’t never kissed anyone before.. so from disgust to smooth talker.. not bad but still breaking past that initial disgust women when they realize I might be hitting on them is difficult. It’s was a challenge I had to get past to make them see how awesome a guy I really was (kinda like a Ross Geller or Ted Mosby). That was 5 years ago, I’m now in a beautiful long term relationship with one of those girls(she’s Asian) who initially wasn’t attracted to me(she didn’t look at me with disgust though, she was respectful). So gotta keep failing bros till you succeed in finding the right one. But keep your approach respectful.",

She smacked my layup down back so hard that it hit me in the face and gave me a bloody nose.  Absolutely BRUTAL rejection.\nLater on in life I met Sarah at a college party and had the chance to return the favor.  We still had mutual friends even at the large state university we attended.  I ended up bumping into her at a kegger and we talked about that day and how it gave her the confidence she needed to make the girls basketball team and start her athletic career.  She apologized unnecessarily and we laughed about it.  One thing led to another and we quickly ended up at my place tearing each other's clothes off.  We did the normal sucky licky handy stuff and I started fucking her up against the ladder to my dorm loft.  She told me to bend her over so I flipped her onto the futon which had, of all things, a basketball sitting on it.  I couldn't help but notice the comic irony of me pushing her face down into that basketball as  I fucked her from behind and came all over her back. Not one part of that story is true.

Guess what happens to way too many of us when we reject you, no matter how polite we are?\n\nWe get called horrible things, are violently attacked, are stalked, even made to fear for our lives. Y’all go on and on about how bad rejection is and the posts I’m seeing here are so tame it’s hard to not be angry at you all. We’ve all dealt with r/niceguys and it’s a major reason we can be so abrupt and forceful with rejections. We have all learned the hard way what happens when we are ambiguous. There’s a good chance that if she’s mean or aggressive, you creeped her out or scared her. You act like we enjoy all the male attention we get when the opposite is true. Even if you are always polite and gentlemanly, a lot of the guys before you weren’t.\n\nFor as long as society has existed, women and girls have had to reject male advances. If you all would police one another and hold all men to a higher standard, we wouldn’t have to feel so defensive. Be polite take no for an answer (the first time!!!) with grace. Men before you ruined it for all of you, so your true enemy is the patriarchy - not women!\n\nYou dramatically increase your chances of success if you give time for attraction to mutually build over a period of time. Flirt. Your odds of a random woman you meet in public accepting your advances are less than 10%, no matter what you look like or how you ask. A MASSIVE percentage of women have been on the receiving end of male violence and stalking, and we have no way of knowing if you’re going to be our next traumatic new core memory. MAKE US FEEL SAFE! That isn’t so much to ask!",

She had to drive to get there and came on her own knowing no one other than me, so I thought that meant she really wanted to see me right? Anyway between performances, she's great singer and we played some songs together, had a good laugh, just a very nice evening.\n\nAs she left that night, she seemed reluctant to go home straight away and I was pretty much packing equipment away at that time, I text her when I got home thanking her for coming, I had a really good time and that we should go out sometime to get to know eachother better. She responded enthusiastically and told me she would have to let me know what her work shifts are like the next day.\n\nThe next day comes and in the evening she messages me saying words to the effect of, 'Wait when you asked to hangout was that like you asking me out on a date?'. I thought it was game over but I replied with a middle of the road answer, 'I didn't have any expectations other than just hanging out, just wanted to get to know you better'. She told me that was fine but she wouldn't ever commit to a date, blaming some such nonsense as and when. Gave up after she made a second excuse, she was with another guy a month later.\n\nJust stung that, I thought there was some chemistry but it evaporated the moment I asked her out. As it happens we haven't seen eachother or spoken ever again, which also stings, wouldn't have bothered if it meant she stopped talking to me.\n\nTL;DR - Asked a chick out that backed off the moment she thought it was 'a date'",

            "text": "I was the stereotypically shy, geeky kid.  Hardly talked to anyone, hung out at the periphery with my friends but generally spent my time at home. My social skills were severely lacking, to put it mildly.\n\nI had a crush on a girl since grade 4.  I don't know why but I just adored her from afar.  Looking back, it's probably because she was popular and confident which was the opposite of me.  We weren't always in the same class but when we were she was always the object of my attention.  In hindsight, probably creepy af as I never did talk much to her I kept it all to myself.\n\nThen in grade 8, I was walking to school like I had every day for my entire school life.  On this day I passed by a group of girls sitting on some grass in the shade.  They called me over.  Completely confused (nobody ever wanted to talk to me) I went over.  I was extremely nervous talking to them and didn't say much but was responding to them.  Eventually the discussion came to if I had any crushes.  These girls were all from the neighbouring school and I had no idea who any of them were, so after a minute of reflection and hesitation I named her.  Of course one of them knew her!  Fuck.\n\nThey told me to write her love note.  To confess my feelings to her.  Looking back, this was more than likely a spiteful idea and they wanted to witness the cringe 3rd-hand, but seeing that I had shared something deep and personal with strangers I, for whatever reason, said \"Ok\".\n\nI always went home for lunch, I lived close to the school.   Usually watched cartoons or whatever bit today I was on a mission.  I sequestered myself in my room and spilled 4 years feelings onto paper.  By the time I was done it was almost 2 pages long.  I took it, folded it up, and went back to school.\n\nI met the girls again on the way back.  They asked if I wrote the letter, and I showed it to them.  I can't remember if I let them read it but I probabaly did.  They told me to leave it on my crush's desk, so I went into the school, located her desk, and shoved the folded up letter in her work book so she would definitely find it.\n\nSchool started.  She found it.  I was super nervous about what was going to happen next, trying to plot out what my first words were going to be and if I should hang out with her and....\n\nI heard her start to laugh.  Loudly.\n\nI was in front of her so I didn't dare turn around but I heard the excited whispers to her friends sitting around her.  The passing of the note to others.  Oh shit.  More laughing.  Fuck my life.\n\nGym class came.  We sat in a circle for some activity, I can't remember what.  I do remember she had brought the note and was reading it aloud to her friends who were sitting around her.  She was barely containing her laughter, her face bright red.  Her friends were all laughing.  I wanted to crawl into a hole and die.\n\nRecess came.  I tried to hide.  Someone came and found me, one of her friends.  They told me to come see her.  I had zero interest.  They basically dragged me there.  I looked down the whole time especially when I was face to face with her.  Well, would have been had my face not been permanently faced downwards.  I couldn't look at her for more than a brief moment at a time.\n\nAll I could say to her was \"you probably hate me\".  Again social skills were not great.  Her reply was \"I don't hate you...\" And trailed off.  I knew what she meant.  I think I mumbled something, turned tail and left.  I spent the rest of the day wanting to cry and hide and run away, but I was not the type to leave school so I stuck around.  When the bell rung, I was the last one out of the class because I didn't want to see anyone.  Once I was sure everyone was gone, I trudged home and spent the rest of the day in my room.\n\nI didn't talk to any girls for a long time because of this (I finally got some courage in Grade 12) but I don't fault her.  I just wish I would have had someone to guide me as to how to approach her, probabaly wouldn't have helped as far as the outcome but maybe it would not have been so embarrassing.",

I don't know him, and I never want to get to know him.\" That one stung a bit, never really forgot it. Made me nervous to ask girls out through high school, because I assumed I was ugly.\n\nAnother time, in high school,  I had finally landed a blind date that my friend set up for me, and the girl and I ended up really hitting it off. She was flirty and she held my hand on the date and I was very excited. We texted and called each other everyday and I was infatuated.  One night, she invited me over to her house because she was throwing a party with all her friends. She told me to show up early so I could meet her mom. So I show up, meet her mom, and her mom seemed to like me a lot. This is where it got weird: her mom mentions that \"WutangWinston seems like a great guy, you should be dating him instead of that other loser.\" This was immediately alarming. Almost on queue, a guy walks in and walks straight up to the girl and gave her a kiss. She then introduced him to me as her boyfriend. I was devastated and ended up sneaking out of the party without detection. She later admitted to our mutual friend that she enjoys messing with boys heads. This made me very skeptical of any girl that showed me attention.\n\n I was able to get closure in the best way years later when I came back home from college and went to a party. I saw her there, and she had gained at least 50 lbs. She walks up to me while I was chatting with a big group of my friends. She tells them that we used to date (lol fuck this bitch) and she said she would be open to it again. I told her no thanks and walked away, and my friends starting laughing at her. She was totally embarrassed and left crying. I relished in the moment for years afterwards.",

Well, this girl I was trying to get to go out with me was one of the people chosen. So the hypnotist starts doing his thing like getting them to act like chickens, and make the floor lava, and stuff like that.\n\nSo then he does this thing where he brings out their worst fears in them and he wakes them up and they all start screaming except for the girl I'm trying to go out with. But picture this. I'm sitting in the stands next to my friends and watching all of this and laughing. This girl is the only one not reacting, but she starts running through the stands and people are laughing and stuff thinking she's running away from a monster or whatever.\n\nThen she sees me and then runs back to the hypnotist and grabs his mic, turns to me, looks straight at me, and says, \"You've been trying to ask me out for the last three months...\" and I'm thinking oh, this is interesting, and my friends are all laughing and shoving each other, but she goes on \"but I will never, under any circumstances ever go out with you for as long as I live...\" The place went dead silent except for the other hypnotized kids screaming and now everyone is looking at me. Everyone. Teachers, the hypnotist, my friends. Everyone.\n\nSo the hypnotist grabs the mic out of her hands puts everyone back to sleep again, tells them that they are all going to think about being happy and feeling great, and they'll wake up in 10 seconds and as they are waking up it's all great and cheerful and lovely 3... 2... 1... They all wake up as if nothing ever happened and they are wondering when the show will start.\n\nI'm sitting there just numb. Numb as fuck. My friends are all like, \"Dude, sorry man. That was bad and harsh.\" I felt like the smallest guy on earth. She had no idea what she did until after it was over and she went to sit back with her friends and they told her what she did and she had this look on her face that was utter horror. They point out where I am and I'm just staring at her and she's staring at me with her hands over her mouth and she looks away and starts crying. I'm not mad, I'm not angry, it's like my soul left my body and I'm watching everything happen from above.\n\nThe principal ended the event, everyone is leaving the gym. I'm just walking with my friends and they are all asking me if I'm okay. I tell them I'm fine, it's cool, she was just hypnotized, lol, whatever forget about it. They just shrug and head back to their classes. I get back to my locker. Grab my keys to my car and just left campus out of sheer and utter embarrassment. Went home and crashed. I got a call from the principal and VP if I was okay and then later that night I get calls from friends asking if I'm okay and all that and trying to blow it off and make light of it. Then I get a call from her. We exchange pleasantries. She starts crying and starts apologizing. I tell her it's okay, don't sweat it, we're cool. \n\nWe never talked or looked at each other ever again for the rest of the year. Eventually, it got better for me and people lightened up, but to this day, that is probably the worst. I've been blown off before. It's no big deal because nothing will compare to that, so what it taught me was that being rejected by women is okay because they could never compete with that incident.",

Example: a girl I had a lifetime crush on and walked home from school every day took my hands, flashed her beautiful blue eyes at me like she never had before and said, \"my parents-um-think you're my boyfriend.  Isn't that, like, silly?\" Further eye batting. \n\nDumbass me: \"Yeah- that's...funny.\" Followed by absolute heartbreak because my  idiot self assumed she thought dating a potato face was hilariously not possible.   Twenty-ish years later she said \"didn't I ask you out in high school?\" and I learned that I was not a potato face to her. An idiot, but not horrid.",

Alternatively, I could have taken the easy route and just drop out of school entirely.

            "text": "Ive got a pretty long one:\n\nMet her at a Halloween party some friends from college threw. Hit it off a bit and got her number then arranged a date. Took a bit for schedules to match up so date was mid November by then. \n\nWe met up for dinner near her place as she lived in a major city and I lived next state over in the middle of nowhere. Drive would have been maybe an hour to hour and a half but with rush hour traffic, took me over three hours (I wasn't late I allowed for it, but man was country boy me not cut out to navigate rush hour traffic in the city). Dinner went well I thought and after we ate we stayed on and talked for a long time. I left feeling pretty good. \n\nAgain schedules got in the way so next thing you know it's december and its her birthday. She invited me out with her and her friends for her birthday, which I thought was a good sign. This was on a Saturday night so traffic wasn't an issue, but being December in the northeast it snowed so again took me several hours to get down there. Seeing as it was her birthday at a busy and loud club/bar I figured I wouldn't get much one on one time which I was fine with. I mostly stood around for a while because she kept getting pulled away for pictures, to ride the mechanical bull, basically very much in demand by the whole group as it was her birthday. But when one of her friends said she really wanted to dance but no one would go with her, I offered to dance with her to avoid awkwardly standing around.\n\nDancing was fun, we kept it tame no dry humping or anything as I was interested in the birthday girl. But then while we were dancing, the birthday girl ends up on the dance floor. She of course ends up next to me but is grinding on some dude and then starts making out with him. That stopped me cold and I ended up kinda staring for a minute, which caught her eye. She pulled me aside and said she didn't feel a spark and just wanted to be friends. Kinda a punch in the gut, but I took it in stride. Went back to dancing with the friend for a few, then thanked her for saving my night and made my exit citing the weather and a long drive.\n\nSo if that whole experience wasn't bad enough, a couple days later she calls me up. She wanted to thank me for coming out on her birthday, highlighting that I made the drive in the snow when some of her other friends who were closer didnt even bother. I could sorta tell something was up as she didn't seem to remember friend zoning me, so I straight up asked if she remembered our conversation and she admitted she didn't, had gotten too drunk. So we then got to have the her friend zoning me conversation all over again, as yes thats how she really felt. That was a nice bonus to watching her dry hump then makeout with someone, who, btw, turned out to be a random guy she met that night at the club. \n\nAnd then the little epilogue to my already way too long tale is that both times she was rejecting me, the girl was trying to get me to go for her friend that I was dancing with, saying she would be able to set us up. So I figured why not. Ended up asking her out to dinner, but she very upfront told me she wasn't looking for a relationship, so we never ended up getting dinner. I didnt have much invested in her so I didnt sweat that one too much, but I thought it was a funny end to the whole crazy ordeal.",

Girl claimed I was following her around all night and threw it at her and her date, my date immediately yells that we had been outside making out and dancing before that the whole time. The true story was that her date apparently had gotten really annoyed with her and tried to leave her to hang out with his friends, got blocked when she tried to throw the plastic cup of punch at him, then was too embarrassed to take responsibility for her lies and bad attitude. Talked to the guy later and he apologized for everything that happened in the week to me, and that he finally noticed she lied about things constantly to the point he just wanted to get away from her. \n\nWe all got sent back to our camp buildings, but my date and her building leader came by shortly afterwards so we could finish our date without being bothered. Ended up playing cards, talking, and getting really close before they left when people were starting to leave the dance.

I went to see her at her flat a few days later, to try and talk through what happened...\n\nShe was just in a dressing gown, getting ready to go out; I don't remember much of the early conversation, but she stood there and said \"I'm a woman, and I've got my needs, and you can't possibly satisfy them. Come over here...\" and pointed to her side;  I went to stand next to her, and she pointed into a mirror and said \"Can you imagine anyone ever wanting that?\"  I was too shocked to say anything, and she then said \"I'm going to go fuck this french guy I like, turn around\".  I did, and I heard her drop the dressing gown.  She was between me and the door, and I didn't want to push past her for fear of her being able to say I'd tried to grab her or something.  I can still remember hearing what was obviously her sliding on her silken underwear... \n\nWhen she was dressed, she said \"Now drive me over to him\".  Stupid thing is, I did. I have no idea why.  \n\nLater I found out from a mutual friend she was telling anyone she knew that I was a push over and to borrow things from me and then keep them; I spent a few days after that going from door to door demanding it all back, including from her. I think she sent a few spiteful emails from other people's accounts too, but I was never able to prove that.\n\n\nThat hurt much more than the cruelty I saw as a teenager; at secondary school the other kids used to push me towards a girl I used to like, until she panicked and freaked out; one time she picked up a chair and started hitting me with it... of course again, you couldn't defend yourself against the girl, you'd have to fight the boys pushing you to get away; and then you have to purge yourself of any sexist, hateful thoughts to remain a good person.  But if you were strong enough inside, you could at least believe that. \n\nIt was the later experience at University that went much deeper, because you can't argue that someone *has* to find you attractive; And it's a much, much harder battle to protect yourself from internalising just how, how ugly people see you as being.\n\nI found happiness with much better people later.

She said no, she was busy with her family that day. I hung up the phone feeling accomplished. I'd asked a girl out! I mean, it was pretty obvious to me that she wasn't into me. Busy with her family? Might as well have told me she was washing her hair that day!\n\nImagine my surprise when she called me back 15 minutes later and said that she'd go out with me after all. She'd talked to her parents and they moved the family thing. Whoa! Now I was SUPER stoked! Not only had she said yes, but she moved things around in her personal life to make it happen! She must really like me!\n\nDay of the date, we go mini golfing. Fun time all around. After a round of minigolf, we got ice cream and sat and talked. And that's when she dropped this line on me, \"I only went out with you cause my mom made me.\"\n\nSee, she was a bit of a loner geek girl. Never really went on dates. Her parents knew me (dad was one of my professors), and I guess wanted her to give me a chance. No one but me knew how devastating that all was to me. I think I had realistic expectations until she called back. Then I think I started misreading the situation. Yeah.\n\nI've only asked out two more girls. One shortly after I graduated college. We half dated for a month (took it slow because of a bad break-up she'd just gone through). Then she broke it off and started dating my then best friend a few weeks later. Oof. Rough again. I honestly could write a book about the messed up drama around that. Maybe several. It ends with one in prison and I'm still trying to process it all years later.\n\nRight before I turned 30, I asked a third girl out. She's now my wife and we've been married almost 6 years. Took me awhile to find her, but I'm thankful my journey here has been so different from the usual.",

So we get there, she disappears and I can’t figure out where she’s at. Her friends tell me to wait, because she’s got a surprise for me. So I’m thinking “Wow... she’s never done anything like that. In fact, no one has”, so I was pretty happy right about then. Then they lead me to where she’s making out with this freakishly gigantic guy (I was already almost 6 ft tall and he made me look short). I stare for awhile until she stops to say “I wouldn’t have had to do this if you’d been man enough to do this yourself.” (weird intimacy issues I didn’t know I had... never touched her once in nearly two years... but she never said she wanted me to) so of course I apologize and leave. \n\nThe next summer she’s all like “We never technically broke up, I really miss you. We should get back together.” My awkward ass does exactly that, and then 4 months later I ask if she wants to go out to some stupid thing that was happening that she was excited about and she says “Look, hun, I really like you, and you’ve always been nice to me when no one else has, but you’re kind of a fucking weirdo and I need a man. I’m going with Giant McSquareJaw from last Valentine’s”\n\nSo of course, there was much bowing and scraping followed by crying and hiding from the world. I wasn’t even really mad. I’m not even really mad about it looking back across half my life. But I really hate that awkward, stupid kid who was me. And I like to pretend he’s not still me.

Talk about life, talk about her ex and how she wanted someone to care for her.  \n\n\nAfter a bit, on my breaks I'd go hangout where she was and talked about some more random stuff like that. Never got any inclination of her being uncomfortable or not wanting to talk, and I'm generally good with signals and that stuff. Others generally consider me to have a silver tongue (Though I'd beg to differ, I'm just a shitposting mess of wild 'humor').  \n\n\nAnyways, after about a couple weeks of this, and her occasionally getting physical, hugs and such, running fingers through my hair when I sat and complimenting said hair. I decided why not ask her out. So on my break I went over to switchboard, talked to her, asked if she'd be up for dinner some time next week. She smiled and seemed to receive it well, told me she'd get back to me once she knew a day that worked for her.  \n\n\nNext day I heard from 2 co-workers that she thought I was creepy and that the rumor started to spread around. Granted, I had already seen someone be fired for my job when a girl complained about him so I was nervous.   \n\n\nDecided fine, whatever, I'll deal with it. Went to switchboard the next day, apologized if I ever made her feel uncomfortable; and told her that the only time she should be talking to me at work is for work related reasons only.  \n\n\nAfter that the rumor went around that I was an asshole for asking her out on a date and then rescinding my offer.  \n\n\nGirls are weird, but to be fair, if I did make her feel uncomfortable at any point and she wasn't just playing two faced attention seeker; I wish she would have told me, so I could make sure never to do that again in the future.  \n\n\nOH WELL.  \n\n\nTL;DR - got the work around and rumor drama from her rather than just saying 'No'",

We ended up dating for 6 months, she had twin girls and was a single mom working 3 jobs, model was the side hustle. I treated her like a QUEEN and helped her in life. She was out of coffee, so I went out and made a special trip just for her to buy her some, I lived 30 mins away from her. Her stalker ex slashed her tire on her 6 day old car, I bought her a new tire. She was hesitant on men because of the ex but I won her over with time and patience. Did a weekend get away and bought a jacuzzi room on a beach. We spent the evening and morning having sex. The one and only chance we'd get, some more life events happened like her stalker breaking into her house and it put a huge damper on things. One day she called me out of the blue and told me that she didn't want to date anymore. That I was the nicest person she'd ever been with and most men were shallow narcissistic people. That I gave her her self confidence back and set the bar and know what she's worth and what she'll expect from a man from now. That I was everything she wanted... Just not ME. Bunch of bullshit and made no sense to me. \n\nIt's fine tho cuz she had the WEIRDEST vagina I'd ever had and felt like fucking a paper towel tube.

One night I asked her if she would be my GF and she said yes... took it back next day said she didnt want to start a serious relationship before she was about to do a semester abroad. Later she told me that she started dating somone. This was after her going back on agreeing to be my GF and also me driving 4 hours to have thanksgiving with her entire family. She didnt want to call what we did for like 3 months dating and already was using it with some other guy...in that moment I litterally fell to my knees and cried in anguish, thank god no one else was home back then. A couple months pass by as she was doing her semester abroad and she reached out looking for comfort because the guy dumped her/or cheated on her ( I dont remember clearly.) Anyways me still being in love with her consoled her and kind of started talking again. After a while I decided I had to go for broke and lay everything I had on the table and tell her how I really felt. During our time together I knew I loved her but never said it because she had told me that others who have told her that kind of pressured her into relationships-same thing with this guy she chose over me did- and I just thought that if she was every going to be truly happy in a relationship she would have to make that choice and I couldnt force it. But anyways, I wrote her a long letter telling her how I felt about her and how much I loved her. She didnt feel the same though. I knew that but I've always been the kind of guy to fight to the bitter end and to lay it all out there when I love somone. Eventhough I knew she probably didnt feel the same, something she said in the response hurt more than the overall rejection. She said something like \"you dont love me, you just love the idea of me.\" It hurt me and made me angry because I knew what I felt and it felt like a slap in the face not to at least have her acknowledge my feelings a genuine. I could have avoided so much pain and resentment if she had just acknowledged my feelings and just said that she didnt feel the same way.",

This was also partially because her best friend told me she liked me.   \"You should ask her out, she's a little shy.\"  She told me her friend liked roses so I went out and blew what little money I had (wasn't working) on a dozen roses.\n\nGot up the courage to ask her out before our 1st class, gave her the roses and she dryly said she wasn't interested.  It wouldn't have been too bad if several of her friends (plus her best friend) were behind her laughing like it was the biggest practical joke ever. \n\n\"What a loser!\"  And other things were said.  One of her friends took the roses and threw it in the hall garbage.  It was crushing. \n\nI just delved deeper into gaming and really just wanted to be left alone for a long time.

I just don't like social conventions when you \"hide\" yourself and try to \"conquer\" the other persons. That being saying: Every woman rejected me, as direct, as I asked her out. It sucks, but in matter of attraction is what it is, you are into a person or not. Till now, I didn't mean the person who have reciprocal feeling. But I can say just this: Is not brutal or cruel, I rather prefer an unwanted truth in face, than a beauty  lie, especially on this topic. Rejection hurt every time no matter times or person who rejected you, because you put energy and emotion in your wishes of relationship, but other person maybe not feel the same, sucks, but it's fine. I can choose her, she can choice to not choose me. So is not cruelty is just unvoitable reality.

            "text": "I actually have 3 different stories of “rejections” from girls that I didn’t even officially ask out, who contacted me first.\n\nFirst was the girl who added me around my freshman year of high school on snap. Asked me for a streak and then when I sent them out, she went and texted my one friend like “Lol who is this dude i don’t even know him lmao he’s obsessed with me he keeps sending me snaps.” Like she literally asked me all this info about me when she added me and I simply fulfilled her request, and she went off slandering my name to someone I was friends with. Worst part about it is she actually worked at a place where I commonly went, and would always try to talk me up like nothing happened. Just embarrassed me in front of my friends for no reason. \n\nSecond was the girl who claimed to be a “snow bunny” who was from a different school than I was. And was sliding up on my thirst trap ab pics on my story and shit. She would just regularly sent me body pics and talk about how she’d walk around the house naked when she was home alone. So naturally I think this girl is at least a little interested so I basically just told her that I thought she was hot or I was trying to start something. She texts THE SAME FRIEND from the first story and essentially tells him that I begged her for nudes and sent her an unsolicited dick pic during those efforts. And for some reason this all went down in one day and my friends tried to tell me I’d be in the wrong for confronting her and calling her out. Like they legit just tried to say I was mad cause I didn’t get nudes from her. I texted this girl back like “Damn I can tell you don’t fw me like that” and this girl types out some long ass rant about how I’m just like every other guy, screenshots the chat, and then blocks me. Thankfully that girl didn’t go to my school but that shit just ruined my faith in girls at that point. \n\n\nThird was the time I posted something on my story that was actually posted on Reddit a few times, about news channels reading off similar scripts. This girl, who was known as a lesbian, slid up on my story talking about how crazy it is that the media does stuff like that, and then just starts making conversation about school and shit. Me trying to keep things platonic (which I actually was) I just kept things simple and talked back with her. She was telling me about how guys only like her for her ass and shit and was asking me what hair color she should get, and I just gave her basic answers. Didn’t give any superficial compliments, didn’t flirt with her or anything. Fast forward a month or two and I realize I haven’t texted this girl, and I don’t really think anything of it because she’s literally been the one initiating the convos every time, and suddenly one of my other friends tells me to explain sometning his sister told him. Apparently this girl had went up to her friends in lunch and pointed me out to them and basically told them that I was trying to flirt with her and get in her pants, but I actively refused to show my face because I knew how ugly I was and knew I’d never have a chance with her. I still have no idea why she did that shit because she never sent me snaps of her either.",

I’m getting ready to turn off the car to follow her inside thinking that was the idea and she shuts the door while shouting, “See you at the bar sometime,” and racing inside with her friend.",

            "text": "Haha fuck you for making me relive this.\n\nGood ending, sort of, but I had the hots for this girl from grade 5-8. Hottest girl in the class, we always hung out with a mutual friend smoking weed, and even kissed at a dance when I was piss drunk and apparently didn't remember but she may have been lying idk. Anyways, she knew I had the hots for her and I asked her to be my girlfriend, as dumb kids do, and she said no multiple times, but we still stayed friends. Years pass and grade 8 she starts dating the extremely short for his age and skinny like an anorexic kid, and I straight up asked her, why would you date him, and not me or any guy 10x hotter that you definitely could get? Personality. I was dumbfounded LOL. She went on to call me a psychopath because of the one time I opened up about a dream where I murdered half the school faculty with a chainsaw. After watching texas chainsaw massacre, and living through daily violence. \n\nThinking girls like bad boys, being a little fucked in the head myself at that age, and social life revolved around drugs, sex or video games makes for a very unattractive boy, no matter how good looking. Scrawny kid was an avid soccer player and was popular with the sporty kids. DING DING DING! Fucking bell went off in my head and never said another damn thing  in that respect to her. learned a very valuable lesson though.\n\nAs much as I wish her the best, I lost contact and know she's probably knocked up with multiple baby daddies, this girl walked into the same stop sign twice in a row in under 5 seconds for attention, I do NOT have high expectations for her, but respect her because of the genuine friendship she brought in my childhood? Idk I know she definitely got into drugs and promiscuous sex after she moved away at the start of high school, I know her lol, but... I really do hope things turned out good for her... even though I know what I saw hahaha. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got dumped after getting caught making out with an ex when I was like 8... 9 or 10 ish. Her and her friends walked up, her friend said she saw me kissing some girl last week and it's over between me and whatsherface I dont even remember... and her bitch friends, after my now ex and other friend walked away, tried kicking me in the nuts, but I kinds dodged it and kicked the back of her other knee on her support leg and she fumbled to the ground. Kinda a dick move on my behalf, but kids are stupid.\n\nMy asshole story, I told a girl who was really into me when I was like... 8-ish, if she didn't kiss me I wouldn't be her boyfriend, and she was just anxious and shy and I was pressuring her and then I just walked away after several moments. It's fucking horrible, but at the very least, I learned at an early age through a non severe experience, pressuring someone to do something is not okay, doesn't always work, and too much effort to do over finding a willing participant? \n\nOr me being too damn proud of being 1 year older than a girl I was kinda playing around with in 7th grade. I think her actually coming to my house to see if I wanted to come outside and play is what made me hesitant, because like fuck this girl could ever like me. Hope it didn't effect her too much when I told her I didn't want to talk to her anymore... she turned into a beautiful young lady in high school, so my loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter realizing I'm no good for relationships, I opted out of them all through high school until I got my fuckin head on straight. FIRST attempt, the girl was a fucking PSYCHO who sent me pics of self mutilation and suicide attempts for attention, and turned out to be an unemployed alcoholic cheater. SECOND ATTEMPT, it ended with a girl trying to see if she'll start to get feelings, and breaking up with me 2 days after finding out she's preggo. FUCK-in karma!!!!! lmfao, hurt like a bitch, all I wanted to do was be a stand up man in a situation I fucked up and be there for her and she wanted none of that. I now have the motto of not sticking my dick in something until they say they love me hahaha.\n\nHad a fling with a rich bitch, religious, and EXTREMELY hypocritical. Found myself sitting there after work with her and her friend just chatting about the stupidest shit, stuff that made me literally roll my eyes and sigh... I'm GLAD she ghosted me, because the conversation of her being about as interesting as poking a dead body with a stick wouldn't go over so well. She's an asparagus, and asparaguses have the personality type that 1200$ designer clothes and nose jobs are the norm, and being treated exactly how medieval queens were treated sounds cool. Looked like she was cosplaying as a Kardashian ffs, and the same personality as one. \n\nThen I found a gem and it's going great and every single past issue that has fucked me up is NOT going to get in the way haha. Love you babe!",

Next time I saw her she acted like it never happened so when I asked her about it she got really defensive and confrontational like I did something wrong. Asking \"what exactly is it that you want\" \"are you trying to date or do you just want to fool around\". Felt like that came out of nowhere since the only contact we'd had after I asked her out was the one text and that's it. She then went on to say how she had a lot of stress between nursing school and work and social life and she couldn't date. I accepted that and tried being as reasonable as possible saying I understood. Didn't stop her from avoiding me and not really speaking to me anymore. The whole experience just left me wondering what I did wrong or what was the right thing to do when the brutal truth was most likely that she never liked me she just panicked and said yes and upon reflecting on it realized she made a huge mistake and put the blame on me for asking her out to begin with and putting her in that situation.

I don't care. Really... I don't. I did not like her. I thought she was attractive and wanted to see if maybe we got along and see if we liked each other. I am not the type to have crushes and like someone if I don't even actually know them. Its all very casual to me.   \n\n\nAnyway, so she seemed to have lost interest... and I did not think much of it and continued on as normal and treated her no differently... which basically meant saying \"hi\" in passing... didn't even try talking to her... The workplace was large with many departments... I was not going to go out of my way to talk to some girl who was not interested... obviously. But I would see her in passing... given my job had me moving all over the place... as did hers.  \n\n\nBUT THEN... One day... randomly... she started acting fuckin' weird. As if I was this creep who would not leave her alone. MONTHS after I asked her if she wanted to hang out. It was bizarre. I literally only said \"hi\" in passing. BECAUSE... I am not going to treat someone as if they don't exist. That would be weird. And I'll greet anyone in passing. I treated her like I would treat anyone else. But she apparently had the wrong fucking idea... she had this \"OMG he likes meeee and he keeps saying hi to me he won't leave me alone.\" Like some fuckin' middle school girl.   \n\n\nSO... I did the sensible thing and just started ghosting her. I did not want to do that.. but... WTF am I supposed to do? And then she started talking to me. Fucking bizarre.   \n\n\nI am not into immature nonsense. We are both adults. I very casually just wanted to hangout... to see if it went anywhere. It meant very little to me. I am very open to hanging out and seeing where it goes... either platonically or romantically... male or female (romantically is female specific). Apparently to her, that meant a whole lot more than it did to me.   \n\n\nSO... it did not end terribly. But undoubtedly I was drastically misrepresented to her work peers... they only heard whatever she told them, and had this inaccurate idea of me. Not that I care, but it is not exactly favorable... and I'd prefer people not have an unfavorable, inaccurate view of me. But whatever.   \n\n\nThe lesson... NEVER try to hangout/date a woman at work. EVER. If you are a dude anyway. Unless a woman is actively pursuing you... don't try. It can end poorly. And even then... the cost if things go wrong is too great to risk it. Just look elsewhere. The potential for drama is too high.",

So at the beginning of this frosh event they called all of the engineering students to the auditorium for something, I missed it, because I had to take a massive dump, huge dump. Before leaving I asked this girl for her phone number, just so that I had someone to contact in my group. I was not interested in her, I had no friends, and I was scared in a new city, so I just wanted to be able to contact someone to be able to get back to my group after taking that dump. I asked her \"hi can I get your number\", I don't ever the full sentence. I did not realize that had a flirty sub context. This girl, not gonna give her name, just straight up tells me \"why the fuck would I give you my phone number\", her friend next to her was like \"ouch, you don't have to be that mean\". \n\nI still don't like her, I never talked to her after, and that moment was literally the start of my depression I think. She was very mean.",

We're about 3min out from the house, and she drops the bomb.... completely out of the blue. I had no idea and was completely floored......\"You think your roommate would fuck me tonight?\".......talk about a hard hit. MONTHS of effort washed away instantly as I quickly learned exactly where I landed on her radar.\n\nWe get home, I let her in, and get her situated on the couch with a drink and say wait here.

            "text": "This one wasn't so much the initial rejection as it was what happened after. I met this girl at church and we started talking a bit. I decided to ask her out because I hadn't been on a date in a while and I was tired of being timid. She was really nice and we seemed to have some stuff in common, so I asked her if she'd like to go out sometime, maybe get some coffee or something, just she and I. To my surprise she said yes! I was elated. Now, for some dumb reason, I didn't get her number before I left because I was too excited. No problem, I'll see her next week. A week goes by and I see her again and ask her about our date and it turns out she thought I just wanted to go get coffee as friends. She said she had just broken up with her boyfriend and wasn't looking to date at the moment. I sympathized and left it alone. Almost 2 months later I decided to try again. I said hey, I know you went through a hard break up but I'd love to take you out on a proper date. She said she wasn't interested, even if she hadn't gone through a break up. She wasn't rude or mean about it, just honest. I was prepared to leave it there, on to the next or whatever. I told her no hard feelings and went to leave. As I'm starting to walk away I decided to ask her a quick question about something at the church since I was still pretty new there, so I turn around real quick and say, \"oh, hey...\" and she lets out a very audible \"No!..\" She didn't yell it, it wasn't a no, like no go away, or no you loser I won't talk to you anymore. It was almost like a yelp, like \"why is he coming back, oh no what do I do\" kind of thing. I'd never felt like so much of a freak in my life. So what now, just by virtue of doing my best to be a gentleman and ask a woman out I'm freaking her out to the point of yelping no because she just wants me out of there. She looked at me and I looked at her and I just said okay, sorry and left. I never saw her again. I never went back to that church again. I just left. Because apparently I'm a terrible, overbearing person even when I'm doing my best. I immediately started going over everything I'd done in my head over and over, trying to make sure I didn't commit some horrible mistake. I've second guessed myself ever since.",

It wasn’t even a complex where you can sit down and talk, it was one of those furniture/industrial complexes.\nAnyway he goes on to tell me out the front of a white goods store that he doesn’t love me and doesn’t think he ever will. And gave me two weeks to move my stuff out (I wasn’t on the lease). Fucking broke my heart tbh. But I was young and dumb and continued to periodically sleep with him for a few months after until we finally went no contact.\n\n2. Was with my ex girlfriend. I thought I loved her. She said she loved me. Wanted an open relationship, well not open, polyamorous. I wasn’t keen. But have it a go anyway. Met a guy that I liked and she lost her fucking mind, even though she had a whole ass boyfriend on the side at the time as well.  I wasn’t overly interested in the dude. But she made me feel second fiddle to her dude. And always told me how he would always be apart of our relationship, even though I was her ‘primary’.

Naturally, my circle was small with minimal interaction with the girls of my grade; oh, and by most accounts from people back then apparently thought I was either gay with my best friend or dating my first cousin. That's the context of myself for the following:\n\nI was just minding myself in our Literature class when the guy sitting behind me says \"Hey, Traez_Housetter do you like A?\" To which I quietly answer \"I.. I guess. Why?\"  And he says back \"Well, I'm gonna set you up with A!\"\n\nMeanwhile, said girl is literally right behind him as she says that in the seating order. She heard all of that. And rather than just saying \"No, I'm not interested\" or just simply not reacting, she said loudly -- atleast loud enough for someone a row or two over to hear -- \"Ewwwww, why would I want to go out with Traez_Housetter?!?\" Which made me think \"I know I'm not that good looking of a guy, but geez I wasnt too involved in this process either. Guy, must have just wanted to make me feel bad by answering his question.\" \nThen A's friend B rushes over to ask what's wrong, A answers, and then they both repeat the \"ewwww\" process again. At this point, I really wish I never said anything and just ignored Guy.\n\nAnd before you say \"This was in middle school Traez_Housetter, girls are like that\" and I'd say \"yeah, you're right. And Girls A and B werent really every horrible to me in any other instance up to and including graduation.\" However, those being my formative years combined with the lack of people I really clicked with on campus, I never really matured my dating/flirting \"game\". And, consciously, I know that women i asked out nowadays wouldnt react in such a manner, but my subconscious does. So, whenever I do get close with a girl I'm as clueless as they come, and whenever I do feel close I always stop short because of that deep rooted fear brought out by that formative event.\n\nIt also doesnt help that when I do get the cojones to do so, I never get to ask them out. I always get told indirectly by some third party why it wouldnt work out \"She's a lesbian\" ,\" she likes older guys\" , when the lesbian one was actually proven wrong \"oh, it looks like the guys she goes for are out of your league\" -- also proven wrong like a boyfriend or two later.\nTo which point I stop pursuing that interest no matter how much time has passed since I've gained interest. So, that one brush of \"rejection\" is my current and only strong brush on the topic.\n\n\nNote:\n\nI have had one girlfriend, but I dont count her in the \"asking out\" category because we were kinda set on to that path by two mutual friends.

I got her nieces number and spoke to her over the phone for about 2 to 3 days and we genuinely got to know each other and I thought seemed to like each other. I coordinated a time to take her out for dinner and when I picked her up I handed her three roses and she genuinely looked disgusted and would not take them from me and asked what made me think this was a date?

You know the feeling, that intense hormonal teenager crushing. I just knew she was the one. She was the quiet, nerdy, awkward type that laughed at all my terrible jokes and seemed to get along well with me. I was the nerdy, outgoing type that couldn't get out of my own head when it came to girls. I eventually told my friend in that class about my feelings, and he got me super hyped up to ask her out. He literally said the line \"the worst she can say is no.\" So with a head full of hormones and a heart full of confidence, I caught up with her in between classes to shoot my shot. I told her that I thought she was really cool and that I was wondering if she'd be my girlfriend. She paused for a second and broke into a dead sprint, screaming like i was chasing her with a knife. EVERYONE stopped and stared at me. I got more than a few dirty looks, and plenty of giggles. For weeks afterwards, random people approached me, asking if I was the guy who asked out Susie (not her real name). She did apologize in the form of a note also given to me by a stranger, but it damaged my confidence to the point that I didn't ask another girl out for years afterwards. \n\nSorry if formatting is weird, I'm on mobile.\n\nTl;dr: asked a girl out in school, she ran away screaming.

Was talking to a girl on Tinder, things are going well, exchanged numbers and talked for a little while. I asked her out, she had a wedding to go to that weekend, so we made plans to go out on the next Friday. Things sounds great, she's excited, I'm excited. I leave her alone for the weekend, and I text her on Monday night, three days since our last conversation, asking how the wedding was. She replies it was good. Then goes on a tangent on how I've been texting her too much and how she's so independent and can't have someone trying to talk to her all the time, then cancels our date on Friday saying \"actually, I don't want to meet you.\" I was taken aback, because I thought things were going well so I said ok, yeah, I'm a little thrown off by this, that's fine, but did I do something wrong? She responds \"how dare you even ask that, I don't owe you anything\" then says its because she barely knows me...no shit, that's why I'm talking to you and trying to go on a first date with you. So glad to have dodged that one\n\n2. Was supposed to go out with this girl on a date, also from tinder.

I was totally in love with her and it came as a complete punch to the gut. when she started to laugh at my obvious distress and utter confusion The shock turned to horror. And I remember thinking “oh this is like something you only see in the movies or read in Reddit posts, but now I’m experiencing in real life. Who is this person and why are they doing this to me?” It was even more disheartening when she tried to gaslight me into thinking that my feelings were not my true feelings. I was so confused because I was wondering how I could have misread her so utterly. While things did progress somewhat fast between us I had thought I was careful to follow her pace and never put pressure. I trusted her because I thought we had a friendship already established. \n\nLooking back i didn’t really know her. Only a side of her and I am pretty sure, whether due to some form of cptsd or full blown personality disorder, on some level she knew what she was doing. I spent a lot of time afterwards giving her the benefit of the doubt that it was unintentional on her end, but at the end of the day it seems to me it was calculated. After studying up on personality disorders and emotional abuse it checked all the boxes. I get why she might have did what she did, but it’s still twisted. The one cool thing that came of the experience was I tried doing therapy for the first time and it’s been really helpful. But ugh. It was a brutal experience to go through.

She was so annoyed by my clinginess that she felt the need to pretend to like me and fake a relationship with me for a day just to mess with me.\n\nAh, middle school.  Glad those days are long gone.

Work as a manager at the local deli, wash dishes at night so the wife can stay home with the three little ones. Fast forward 27 years, we move into a small condo as the kids are grown and only stop by on holidays, the phrase \"empty nester\" finally made sense. We've grown tired of each other, little fights happen more often, realize we've only been together so long for the kids and not ourselves. We began sleeping in separate rooms, and over a few months i cleaned out the storage closet to make room for my button-ups. I found our old wedding clothes one day, my old blue tuxedo, put it on for a trip down melancholy lane, little tight around the belly, pat the back of my head as if the old mullet would have suddenly grew back. I bring the dress into her room and ask her to dance, a tear fell down her cheek as she nodded to me, put on some Sinatra, she walks on to our \"dancefloor\" as beautiful as that first time we danced as mr and mrs. We danced and laughed, everything felt right, for a few hours. I ask if maybe she'd like to try again, make it work for old times sake, she turns away and asks for me to give it the night to consider, i agree. I fall asleep with a smile for the first time in a while, sleep heavily through the night, and awake as dawn breaks. Come out of my room, her door is closed, not unusual, walk into the kitchen, notice the dog isn't asking for food, the dogs bowls aren't empty, they're missing, everything is missing, little things here and there through the kitchen, living room, and hallways, missing. I go up to her room as a phoned the police thinking we'd been robbed. She was missing, all of her things neatly missing. Dispatch answers, i tell them \"false alarm\" as i find a little piece of paper on the floor that reads: \"No\".\n\nTL;DR: whether it's after many dates, or on the first, or just asking them out, the worst thing she can say, is, in fact, \"No\".",

Or after) I knew if I made an effort to stop him, it would look like I’d confessed a crush I didn’t have & he was trying to help me out, so after he said he was going to ask her out, I just let him.

The fact that she thought she was so far out of my league that she could be proud of me for being brave enough to ask her out by proxy has stuck with me for almost 30 years.\n\n\n\nTo be real fair, I also recognize that it’s likely the whole experience may have been so unexpected for her that she didn’t know how to respond and deserves recognition for handling it with more class and aplomb than her friends did.

            "text": "Ive never really had a brutal rejection as I’m a bit of a slow mover, by the time I get the message, it’s a done deal. But I do have an interesting story from about 20 years ago when a co worker I liked made it clear she wasn’t interested in me and actually asked me about one of my male co workers, which was either her way of giving me the hint or she was genuinely fishing for info. Being a supermarket there was a lot of staff and some of the other staff had filled me in that she knew I liked her but she had no interest in me. So a bit of a cow move to ask someone you know likes you about someone else. Anyway they ended up getting together and despite me warning her that he was a total dirt bag, she came to me all upset a few weeks later asking me why I hadn’t told her that he was seeing other girls and I was a horrible person etc. I just looked her in the eye and told her I really liked her and had for a long time and that I’d warned her he was a scumbag and that what he gets up to out of work is none of my business, he’s not my friend out of work. She knew he was a player, I warned her but she still went there. A few years later another girl I worked with at the same supermarket (who I also liked but she was involved with someone else who worked there), was involved with a complete douche bag who was shagging anything he could, (including several other girls at work) and this girl was just completely ignorant and stuck with him. By this time I was a manager and one night I asked her to stay back, and sat down in the tea room with her and told her everything. She broke down and said she knew he was bad, I told her a bunch of stories she had no idea about. Anyway she of course stuck with him for a while longer and maybe 6-7 years later I was at a party and she was there and she came up to me and poured her heart out about how I was the only one who told her what was happening and she was an idiot for not listening and she appreciated it so much etc. I kinda got the impression she was somewhat flirting with me (I was in probably the best shape of my life and dressed in an Elmo suit) but I had just got out of a really bad relationship, I was half drunk and looking forward to getting full drunk and being a single Elmo for a while longer. I still have that Elmo suit somewhere.",

            "text": "I had been fairly interested in a girl Freshman year of high school and I ended up having the courage to ask her out. I've never been a huge flirt, and had only been in one semi-serious relationship at that point. \n\nI subsequently told her, and she seemed either really shy or awkward about the whole exchange (the latter). We finished the conversation with her saying that if we talk more in the coming months then I certainly have a chance. I figured that this was just a private thing and didn't expect anyone to say anything at school.\n\nNext day comes and my entire friendship gives me weird looks. During lunch they confronted me about it and asked me why I was \"flirting so hard\" with the girl I was interested in. I got red in the face (like I always do when I'm confronted about anything) and just played it off like I didn't know what they were talking about. My closest friend pulled out his phone and showed screenshots showing what I was saying (I honestly don't remember what I said but I guess it was enough to warrant them to freak out about my \"romantic side\" since I was fairly quiet). \n\nChose not to confront the girl in the next period despite sharing a class with her; I figured it would be less awkward if it was handled outside of school. I called her asking why she'd tell anybody else since I thought it was supposed to remain a private conversation. She literally said that she swore on her mother's life that she didn't tell anyone. \n\nFew days pass and I instigate a conversation. Every question I ask she gives a short answer, so I ask what's wrong. She tells me that she's lesbian and that she's been interested in one of her friends since middle school. I ask why she'd lead me on for literally no reason and she never answered the question. I felt a little petty and asked if it was because of how she was raised, considering she swore on her mother's life that she didn't tell anyone about our conversation. She somewhat reasonably freaked out at me to not mention my family, but then completely shifted morality and said that my parents are complete retards for spewing out an autistic baby and said that I was going to hell for cursing the powers God bestowed upon us. Had no idea she was religious but she clearly wasn't in touch with her god. \n\nI talked to my closest friend the next day (after the slightly heated exchange) and said that he was the reason she came out about being lesbian to me since he said that leading me on like that was just disrespectful. I thanked him but also wondered why he wouldn't tell me since he obviously knew about it. \n\nDuring summer break my closest friend went through a pretty bad breakup and I tried to help him get through it, and later on he'd tell me that I was probably the biggest help out of anyone. Later on, he told me that he \"got a new girlfriend\". I asked who it was and he said \"you'll see.\" I was confused since why would you bother bringing anything like that up if you weren't gonna tell me. Turns out it was the girl I was originally interested in. I warned him that she's literally satan, and he told me to not tell him what to do and that he was his own person. I reminded him that she was lesbian, and he didn't think anything of it. They immediately broke up after he found out she was already cheating on him with this girl.\n\nI tried so hard not to tell him that I told him so, and I told him that I wasn't going to help him whatsoever through this breakup since I had warned him in advance and he refused to take my advice. That was sadly the end of that friendship. Reached out to him a few months ago and he blocked my new number. Guess he's still salty.",

            "text": "Two that were related...\n\nI was a freshman in college. My sister and I took a trip to visit my cousin (female) who was also a freshman at a different college. We go to some house party and it's basically in a basement. It's dark, but there are a bunch of black lights and a disco ball. Loud as fuck. The girls are off dancing and I'm basically a wall flower because I don't know anyone, but I keep catching this cute girl glancing my way. I'm introverted by nature, but figured I have nothing to lose since I'll never see these people again. I'm making my through the crowd and she sees me coming and does this bashful little smile thing, her eyes drop to the floor while she tucks her hair behind her ear. I'm a clueless idiot when it comes to reading women, but that seemed like a good sign. I got a few feet from her and her eyes locked on mine. She was still smiling. I smiled back. The look on her face changed to utter disgust and she just sort of shrank back into her group of friends. It stung...bad. I had no idea what happened other than I guessed I got close enough where she could see me better. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward about 5 years. My sister has just started her masters at UT (Tampa) and I've successfully failed out and am drifting. I move down to Tampa with sis for a change of scenery. Again, I don't really know anyone so I basically hang out with my sisters friends. We're out Bar Ybor and again I'm basically solo because the girls are just dancing. Same thing. See some cutie glancing, but much less bashfully and more direct. Start making my way through the crowd. She keeps smiling at me the whole time and playfully sipping her drink while sort of moving to the beat of the song. It was incredibly sexy. Again, I get a few feet away and she never took her eyes off mine while subtly biting her lip. Hard to misread that. I smile at her and, once again, the look on her face just completely changed. She basically recoiled in disgust, quickly grabbed her girlfriends arm, and they scooted off somewhere into the crowd. I was basically crushed. I smiled and she was disgusted. It was demoralizing, especially being in new city and not knowing anyone. I just went outside and waited for my sister and her friends to come out. \n\nAt some point, my sisters boyfriend shows up and sees me sitting there. He talks me into coming back in and buys me a beer. We're just talking and I tell him what happened. He tries to make me feel better by saying she was probably just looking at some one else or something like that. Whatever. But we do get on some other random topics and he tells me some story about something (no idea what), but it makes me laugh which makes me smile and I see the look on his face when he realized what the issue was. \n\nI had broken one of my front teeth like 15 years earlier and so about half of it was fake. In regular light, it looked totally natural, but in black light it didn't really show up so I looked like I had this gnarly snaggle tooth in the front. \n\nHonestly, I didn't really struggle with the ladies, but the looks those two girls gave me are still both seared into my mind. It's crazy how bad it hurt at the time.",

            "text": "Life is weird - my most brutal rejection ever somehow ended up being my best friend telling me she had feelings for me. \n\nBeen best friends with this girl for many years, but it was an ever growing love on my end since day one (we met back in our early college days). Eventually I ask her out and we give a relationship a go (there actually was a rejection at first but it's not the main story here - in brief, it wasn't a hard 'no' and simply lead to 'unofficial' dating at first and a few months later she said yes) but in the end it did not work out (she said she'll never be really happy with me and I was devastated but decided I wasn't going to make her life miserable) and we split up but remain close friends and keep hanging out. She dates a couple of guys and at some point moves in with one; I end up meeting a girl as well. After I introduce her to my best friend, the friend stops talking to me abruptly and eventually tells me it was because she now has feelings for me and I should have picked up on that. Never mind that she moved in with her boyfriend and we have barely even flirted, if that, since the break up (intentional on my part because I did not want to jeopardize our friendship); though I must admit I did notice we started hanging out more often than right after our break up, I just thought it was us getting back to being friends we were before. Anyway, we meet up to talk it over. I tell her I still love her and would rather be with her and can split up with the other girl if she wants to give it another try; she says she realized that she gave up too easily on our relationship and she just needs time to properly end her relationship with current boyfriend/roommate first. Knowing from her that her relationship was indeed not going well for a while now and was bad for her, I was hoping she would indeed leave him and then we will reevaluate our relationship. And she soon does leave him... but for another guy. And then another one and so on (not implying there were many, just that at no point was she single - the time scale is months not days) until she settled with the one she eventually got married to. At no point since our conversation was she single or told me she's ready for another try or that she changed her mind - no closure what so ever. Maaaybe she expected me to act while she was dating and interfere with her relationships (which I wouldn't do considering our conversation and pervious break up), maaaybe she did not want to break up my new relationship (despite me explicitly stating I would not have a problem with doing so, back then I have just met her), maaaybe she just had the need to tell me she loves me but was not planning to get back together. There are a *lot* of details that would need to be typed up to argue one way or another or to properly set the scene for the whole thing to debate other possibilities, but I'm not that great at story telling and it is not the point of the post, so I'll cut to the bottom line that is relevant to the OP: \n\n<TLDR> our last deeply personal conversation ended up being her (for the first time!) telling me she has feelings for me and, in retrospect, at the same time rejecting me (technically for the third time, if you count previous break up). </TLDR>\n\nIf you want to know the ending, there really isn't one: many years have passed since, I married that girl I met (and in no small part because of this no longer talk much to my former best friend, though we still keep on touch) but to this day I feel like I'm still stuck in that time period waiting for my friend to become single. We have not really touched the subject since. The whole ordeal was an emotional roller coaster *way* beyond anything I went through before or after, but, to be honest, it was worth the highs and I just need to eventually find my way out of the lows. I don't blame my friend for any of it to this day, but then again - I'm still quite biased.",

            "text": "This one didn’t involve me asking her out. I had merely wanted to be friends, but it turned into a shit storm and within 5 days, I found myself on the verge of being arrested and expelled from Ashley Ridge High School in my freshman year. I don’t care if it was 3 years ago...I still fucking hate her.\n\nI’ve got a fucking STORY to tell you lot on this one.\n\nTLDR: I nearly got arrested and expelled for trying to be friends with a girl.\n\nAlright...so it all started because I saw this girl that at the time I found severely attractive, right? So one day I got home from school home from school and told my sister about her. And surprise surprise, she knew know she was....I refuse to speak her first name out loud...the bitch. Well let me tell you something...she’s who I nearly got arrested over...and it all started on January 18, 2018. It was a normal day of lunch, right? At least supposedly. \n\n I was supposed to be meeting her that day after dropping a few notes here and there. I was so glad that she wanted to speak to me that I had taken a picture of her response and kept it in my photos, even months after that whole escapade. So she was sitting with a group of friends at their lunch table, just dilly-dallying and talking about shit like seniors usually did, considering they were seniors...and me, being a tiny little freshman...was nervous as all hell. \n\nSo I slid a note onto the table to meet at the vending machines in front of her and found myself zig zagging through tables to get away cause I was so damn nervous. I tell you, my heart was pumping that day as if I had got gotten a weightlifting class period done, and I hadn’t even began weightlifting until my sophomore year! So she came out there after about 10 minutes, and I found myself even more nervous, on the verge of quivering when I saw her walk out there dude. She was wearing these black heeled boots, red lipstick, jeans and a denim jacket and a black shirt with some earring...she also had her hair in this French ponytail. \n\nI remember down to the detail how our conversation started. I was looking towards the vending machines, jacket sleeves pulled up in an effort to look somewhat cordial rather than as nervous as I was... She said, “Hi! It’s so nice to finally meet you, Judai!” She had mispronounced my name, and I had corrected it and said nice to meet you as well. I reached out for a handshake and she took it. And I tell you, her hands were so soft... Now that I think back to that day, my fashion suit up was NOT unlocked yet, man. My hair was all messy, I was wearing a pair of fucking SNEAKERS, jacket was wrinkled and pants fucked up... And then we spoke for a bit and I don’t remember much after that for that particular conversation, but I do remember going all out and trying to ask for her Snapchat, Instagram and Phone Number all in one go in that one conversation. \n\nShe said no to all three since she had a boyfriend, but she still wanted to be friends. I went to class damn proud of myself that day, for the previous day before I had chickened out. I was just a few footsteps away from meeting her, but I had zipped into my 6th period because I was so damn scared. So after class the day I met her, I had ran through the hall in hopes that I would see her again that day and talk one more time, and those hopes weren’t misplaced. I had asked her if she knew who a girl named (my sister) was, and she had said she remembered who she was. I had relayed to her that that was my sister, and she was like, “What?! No way!!! That so cool!” So then I asked if she wanted to see a trick tomorrow with the vending machines, and she said: “Yeah, see ya later!”...I was so fucking gratified that day, man. \n\nMy legs felt like jelly, but I had done what I wanted to do. So then fast forward to Tuesday, January 23 and that’s when things went to hell... I show up to school like any other day, right? So I walk through the hallways just like any other morning, and I see her there with a group of friends...and she’s just looking at me like she’s scared of me or something. So this had thrown me off immediately from the get go, and I’m wondering just what in hell is going on. I’m just sitting in my first period, which was Piano wondering just what was happening. Bell rings and the class is over in flash, and I go to Ms. Henderson’s with the intent of asking Ms. HENDERSON what was the matter with Schwartz, not Schwartz herself.\n\nAnd you know just how poor my luck is? It took me about 2 minutes to get down there, and for some odd reason...guess who wasn’t in there and who was? Henderson wasn’t there, but Schwartz was. And she had that look on her face again the moment she noticed me, like I was an imminent danger to her or something. She took her time spitting out her gum in an effort to stall, and my heart is pumping because she was who I was working desperately to avoid. So time skip to lunch, and I’ve got my lunch bag at a table and one of her friend came out to the vending machines to speak on her behalf, telling me that she didn’t want to be friends anymore and this and that and to quit writing her notes and whatnot. This girl that I merely wanted to be friends with...now feared me.\n\nI had said that my intention wasn’t to scare her, and honestly...back then, I wasn’t aware that I was merely guilt tripping myself, cause truthfully speaking...I hadn’t done anything wrong. Anyways, I found myself sitting in my 6th feeling like absolute it’s shit and on the verge of fucking tears...and mind you, I hadn’t released any in about 2 1/2 years...next thing I know, an assistant principal comes in and I hear 6 terrifying words that NOBODY out of an infinite number of people wants to hear...”I want to see First Last name.” I felt like I might soil myself right then and there. I knew exactly what this was about. I had come the conclusion that either Schwartz or her friends had gone behind my back and snitched on me...for what? Putting effort forward in a friendship? Sure, I had been persistent...but if you look at this entire situation, they blew it way out of proportion. They were behaving as if I stalked her or something... And you know what? That is precisely why I am hesitant to walk in the same direction as anyone I come across for an extended period of time unless I’m aware that we are supposed to be going in that direction together. Most of our classes were near one another’s as well! My second period was just a hallway from hers, so if we went to use the bathroom at the same time...I was going to see her. 3rd period, I had gym...she had economics. Both doors were a few feet away from one another. Then I had media arts, she had dance. Those rooms are about a 10 second trip from one to the other. And finally, she had Prob and Stats...and I had algebra. Those rooms were also about a 10 second walk.\n\nAnd even worse...I hadn’t followed her not ONE place that entire time. I didn’t search her up or anything, didn’t search for her house didn’t track what she was doing. Nothing like that. Anyways, that conversation with the principal ended with a more-or-less in school restraining order in which I wasn’t to speak to her unless she initiated the conversation. I obviously abided by that. Next day, I speak to one of her friends that I got to know a bit beforehand. His name is Caleb. I told him what happened, and he clearly understood how far downhill this whole situation had gone. I remember these words exactly: “Yeah, she does NOT want to be friends with you anymore.” 2 years down the line, (more than 3 years since this went down) I thought about and discovered an amazing conclusion...I didn’t do anything. It was honestly them blowing that whole thing out of proportion and picking on a freshman. \n\n       I bet you she was aware of this as well, because near the weeks of October 14 and 21 of that same year, she said hi to me through one of MY fucking associates that she had class with a year prior. So the entire time I wondered just one thing...”Why is this happening to me? I merely wanted a friend, and I didn’t do anything wrong...so why?”\n\n\nSo Elizabeth Schwartz...if you remember me, and you see this post...fuck you. I hate you infinitely, you turned me into a paranoid asshole and if you intend on sending your brother after me to carry out some fucked up plan of yours that you discovered...I will NOT hesitate to hospitalize him. My Instagram is @theuniversalmcoe if you plan on trying to defend yourself.",

Mild goth vibes in the style department, which was absolutely adorable. Somehow we just clicked. One of the first things she asked me was about my relationship history. It was plain to see she was interested. We made silly jokes together, always sat together, held hands all the time, talked deep things about our pasts, our insecurities. I told her she was way more amazing than she gave herself credit for and she told me the same thing. I was in disbelief that such a wonderful creature not only existed, not only let me near her, but even saw me the way I saw her. Could she have been any more perfect? As it turned out, yes: She lived a short bus ride from where I was studying at the time. I was in heaven. I had found love. She was my first date, my first kiss... It was just a matter of time before she'd be my first girlfriend. \n\nAnd then she met a friend of my brother's girlfriend's family and, after we'd all returned home, she got her stuff together and moved away to be with him.",
