    "I’m (27M)about to get my first one bedroom apartment, what are some things I should know about living alone for the first time?\nHaven’t lived at home since college but I’ve always lived with roommates. my lease is up at the end of this  month and I’m finally taking the plunge of living alone in two weeks. Not sure how I’ll like it but it’s happening either way.\n\n\nDid not expect to get so many answers! I can’t keep up and respond to everyone but I truly appreciate all the tips!\n\n\nSo many people have mentioned a bathroom trash can. I’ve always had one and never thought anything of it. The concept of men not having one is wild to me.": [

            "text": "Been living alone for a while so here are some tips. Since it's an apartment learn your rental law, the apt owner will always try to fuck you. Know what is your responsibility and not. Are you responsible for the lawn or general repairs? Is gas water or electric included in the rent or excluded? Take photos before you move in and send them to the landlord. They will try to stick you with a chip in the wall or a tile from the previous tenant if they can. Leave paper trails! Email them, \"as per our text or call we talked about this\" this will save your ass if they try anything funny. Get on good terms with the landlord. (I'm an electrician, so when my job gives out free fixtures I'll ask the landlord if they want anything a d to take it off that months rent.) \n\n Living life is routines. Empty the trash cans weekly, clean things weekly or monthly. Set calenders dates for this! Seriously, this helps with mentally amd socially. No self respecting partner will boink uglies if you live in a cave with fungi and cockroaches. It helps you mentally when things are clean and orderly. Shoes off at the door, dishes soak over night in the dishwasher in the morning. Since you are alone, it is easier to keep things clean and orderly if you maintain it. \n\n Idk how you are but I have a small white board and I write things as needed and have it by the front door. Helps with remembering the essentials, food stuff, toilet paper, bills. For food, unless you have everything planned out, don't keep more than a week's worth of perishables. It'll be cheaper to get that week's worth of food each week vs a months. I've had plenty of veggies or fruit spoil cause I spent two weeks eating out or eating easy food and forgetting that I planned on making something.\n\n Since you are alone, make sure to stock up now over time for emergencies. A group of roomies can pool resources but alone not so much. If you are in FL for example make sure to have stuff for when hurricanes knock out power and water. Better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.",

Cleaning up small things around your place will save you a lot of time instead of letting it pile into a big mess to clean at once. \n\n2. When buying things like groceries, stray away from bulk purchases unless you are very confident that you will be eating that food. I have had plenty of things go bad because I was the only person eating them. \n\n3. Buy cleaning supplies in bulk so you can save yourself the worry of only buying 1 bottle of cleaning solution. \n\n4. If you are working from home at the moment, make sure to separate a space where you can work vs where you relax. I attempted working from my bed and hated waking up in the morning because I would just roll over to my laptop. \n\n4. Make sure to stay active socially and physically. When you’re with roommates it’s usually easier to find things to do/motivate yourself to work out cause others are there inviting you/keeping you accountable. \n\n5. Find pleasure in solitude or you will get antsy. I’m an introvert at heart so this isn’t my biggest issue, but living alone cuts a majority of time spent with other people. Find hobbies that are fun to do by yourself.\n\n6. Make sure you’re doing your due diligence paying your utilities, no one else is gonna be able to pay besides you. \n\n7. Find decorations that suit your personality/style without seeming too immature. \n\n8. Buy a plunger, inner lining for your shower (unless it’s a glass door), and a duster. \n\n9. Ideally buy an extra 2 pairs of sheets so you are able to go about changing your sheets without having to worry about washing them every time. \n\n10. Buy candles/air fresheners, you’d be surprised how used to your smells you will get. If you spend extended time outside your apartment and come back and it smells, it means it’s smelled the whole time and you haven’t noticed\n\n12.

So I make sure I didn't live on the ground floor, I made sure I didn't live overlooking the pool or right next to the elevator or garbage chute or stairs, and I tried to get a corner unit.\n\nMake sure that you have at least one month's rent and utilities in a savings account that you don't touch, shit happens, and you won't have roommates to help you out if something comes up. Have her separate account for car issues if you have an older car.\n\nTry to talk to some of the residents before you decide to rent a place, they'll give you a good idea of what it's like living there. When I first moved to the city I live in now I stayed in an apartment for a few months to get my bearings, it was horrible.  Fire alarms going off all night after the bars let out because drunk people seemed to think it's funny, screaming down the hall, lots of dogs and the elevators always reeked because the dogs would piss in them...and this was a fairly high-end apartment complex, it was not cheap to live there! I moved out after about 3 months but I feel sorry for people who still had to live there.\n\nCheck your commute to and from work, sometimes moving just a few blocks or a mile away can make a huge difference. Try to go against rush hour traffic.\n\nCheck to see where the local grocery stores and the gym are, if you use a gym, or anything else that you think you might need. \n\nThink about whether you're going to want a washer and dryer in your unit or not. I personally can't go without one, even if there's one in the complex. I've just gotten too used to washing my clothes and then letting them sit and then remembering 3 hours later and then putting them in the dryer and forgetting about them for another three or four hours then remembering but not feeling like folding them till tomorrow. You can't really do that at a laundromat or a community laundry. But if you're totally fine with that you can possibly find a cheaper place to live that doesn't have those amenities.\n\nAsk the residents that you talk to how the complex is about parking issues. Especially if you have a parking lot sometimes they can get really twitchy about having you towed. My car almost got towed because even after living there for 4 months the complex forgot to tell the tow company that that was my spot and they just loaded up my car and was halfway out of the complex before I was able to run outside and throw a fit.\n\nFind out how often the mailboxes are broken into, you can look at Citydata.com to ask about certain areas if you have questions or the city might have crime statistics on their website. You can also check with your car insurance to see how much it will go up or down to know what kind of neighborhood you'll be living in.\n\nAnd do buy a plunger before you move in 😋",

There will be nobody to grab them for you and you will not feel well enough to go for them yourself. Throat drops, couch syrup, upset stomach stuff, laxitive, headache pills etc. And food stuff to get you through as well. Tea, soups, vitamins. Living alone I've never felt lonely, expect for when I'm sick. Which is inevitable. But at least you can be prepared. \n\n\n\n\nLastly, chat up the good neighbors. Let them know you're there, and that you'll be there if they need a hand with anything. I'm sure they'll say the same.  And there are simply times where a second pair of hands is really helpful.\n\n\n\nOh and have a plan in case your car won't start in the morning.",

I'm open to criticism, this is just what seemed to help me, personally.\n\n* Don't forget the little things. One day you'll think \"I'm 100% positive I have everything I need\" and the next you've dropped a massive toilet-clogging shit and realized you didn't buy a plunger because it wasn't one of the obvious things to buy.\n* \\[This one only applies to homes/duplexes\\] You can save a SHIT-LOAD of money by keeping your AC at an even 78F *always*. Getting a big fan in the summer and just buying thick, wool lounge clothes in the winter helps. Also if you decide to take a vacation for more than a full 24 hours you can just flip the breakers in your house for everything but the AC and fridge.\n* Don't forget how time-consuming all the cleaning and upkeep can be if you put it off. No matter how tired you are, promise yourself to clean up a mess you've made *immediately* after you make it. You'll be shocked when the weekend comes around and your house is still spotless.\n* \\[The majority of this may also apply to homes/duplexes, I'm unsure how landlords deal with these things\\] Youtube is your friend. If its inexpensive (hole in the drywall, leaky faucet, ect), google how to fix it yourself and make a weekend project out of it. It gives you something to do when you're bored, gives you a dopamine rush when you get it right, and you learn something new! If something expensive or dangerous breaks (AC, sewage, a wall outlet, ect), *then* call a pro.\n* You can cut down on that upkeep I mentioned earlier by consolidating all of a particular chore to a single day. Sundays are my only promised days off, each Sunday I use [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/category/extra-bytes/budget-friendly-meal-prep/) to cook all my meals for that week, then wash all the cooking utensils. Then all you have to wash the rest of the week is one or two Tupperware each day. **Bonus pro** \\- Budget Bytes has saved me *stupid* amounts of money. Find a dish you like, bump that \"Servings\" button up enough to have one or two very hearty meals per day, spend all Sunday evening cooking, and you won't have a reason to eat out as often, waste money on trash food, and you know exactly what you're putting into your body. **Bonus con** \\- If you're not cool eating the same meal every day for a week straight this probably won't work for you but it's *way* cheaper, and *much* better for you to know you're only eating lean meats and whole foods without additives or all the unnecessary sugar BigCorp adds to hit the [Bliss Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_point_(food)) for their products (some brands of pizza/pasta sauce have up to *12 FUCKING GRAMS of sugar* per a *half cup* of sauce - it's like putting a whole fucking chocolate chip cookie on top of your \"healthy\" spaghetti).",

Some of my favourites are cous cous (literally just add boiling water), frozen mixed veg, eggs, cereal, pasta, soup and pasta sauces you just need to add water to, meals in cans and stuff like tinned tuna and tinned tomatoes. Frozen food you just have to toss in the oven works too  For medical supplies make sure you have some paracetamol, ibuprofen, anti allergy meds, cold and flu, cough syrup, general eye drops, plasters/bandaids, liquid bandaids, antiseptic wipes, heat pack, ice pack, wrist splint, knee brace, arm sling/ triangle bandages, gauze and tape.  Having aloe Vera gel can help if in case of burns.  If you get migraines try adding a sleep mask to your first aid kit.  Sunscreen, aftersun, spare sunglasses and moisturiser are great additions too\n\nIf you have upstairs neighbours get good earplugs. If you have downstairs neighbors dont walk around in shoes. Your footsteps will sound heavier to them than to you. \n\n Treat your land lord like you would your boss - be kind but know that they are not there to be your friend.\n\n Take pictures of the flat as soon as you move in. Every wall, corner and ceiling and any & all damage. Send those pictures in an email to your landlord. That way when it's time to move out they can't blame you for any damages or claim ignorance to issue because you have a record of it and the fact you sent it to them.\n\nStore your spare toilet roll under the sink.

They make plastic lids for these bowels you can get online. \n-\tcast iron pan (if you can find one, smooth cooking surface is better than a nobby one)\n-\tstainless steel pots. Ones that have welded on handles and are heavy are a higher quality than anything with bolted on handles. One big pot, one small pot, and maybe a sauté pan. \n-\tif you get these nonstick pots/pans, you can rock a steel spatula.\n-\twhen you buy drinking glasses, pick ones with no details/frills and a flat bottom. If you handwash, they’re easier to clean. If you have a dishwasher, they won’t collect water in the base. But saving jars is totally fine and affordable, too.\n-\tPYREX (all caps) glass bread pan and casserole pan. Don’t get the shitty pyrex, it looks blue on the edges and is more prone to exploding. \n-\tone or two big wooden spoons.\n-\ta microwave, Craigslist or whatever is your friend here. Get the highest wattage you can find so you don’t have to wait 8 minutes to reheat a drink.\n-\taluminum cookie sheets and muffin pan. \n-\ta steel colander\n-\tI like having a rice cooker with a steel (not nonstick) insert. Got one for $10 off Craigslist.\n-\tlazy susans for cabinets, trust me\n-\tif you have no dishwasher, consider a 3-tier wire drying rack off Amazon. I took the shelves and door off of the cabinet above my sink, lined the bottom of the cabinet with plastic drawer liner, and dried/stored dishes there. Very efficient!\n-\ta good wood cutting board is easy to find and cheap, don’t worry about scouring thrift stores\n-\ta good chefs knife and a bread knife. Look for a full tang. I got a good chefs knife on Craigslist for $10. Consider looking for one of those metal ridgey sticks that you can flatten the blade on (exact term escapes me at the moment)\n-\ta good can opener, bottle opener, set of measuring cups and spoons, vegetable peeler, pizza cutter. Nice-to-haves include juice squeezer, ice cream scoop with the swoopy releaser (I also use it for muffin batter), food thermometer, and microplane.\n-\tfor good and affordable spices, look for “ethnic” grocers.\n\nEven if you’re not vegan or veg, Veganomicon is an excellent beginner cookbook. Very chill, doesn’t assume you already know stuff. Between that and the vegetarian flavor bible (bigger and better than the meat version), I am pretty set on cookbooks.\n\nIf you don’t cook or don’t like to cook, feel free to disregard.

            "text": "Congrats, as someone who lived with roommates for a while, living alone is awesome. I think there are more pros than cons but that also depends on you personally. Some tips I wish I had when first moving on my own:\n\nFirst and foremost, buy a plunger on day one. \n\nDon't be afraid to make the whole space feel like yours. I found that after only having a bedroom be my personal space for so long, I didn't really know how to \"fill\" a unit and most of the space stayed pretty plain and I found I didn't spend too much time anywhere except my room.\n\nCommon use items are now entirely up to you and I find doing the whiteboard list on the fridge works for me. Always sucks running out of toilet paper or something.\n\nAgain this is totally dependent on you personally already but as someone who isn't naturally tidy, cleaning a little bit every time you go into a room helps you stay on top of things. Like if you go to the bathroom, take a minute to just wipe down the counter or something quick.\n\nI love to cook and enjoy being in the kitchen and for years and years I never bothered to buy any nice kitchen items because living with others means your stuff will probably end up getting abused a bit. Now that I live on my own I really enjoy doing research on quality kitchen items that I save up for a will hopefully last me a lifetime.\n\nI noticed someone else mentioned this but I think it's worth repeating and that is in may feel lonely at times, especially at first, so don't feel afraid reach out to people. I think the best part about living alone is that you get to choose when you want to see people.\n\nAnother mention was learn the self Heimlich. Being on your own means you also don't have anyone around at a moments notice and choking on something could be deadly if you can't get to a neighbour in time. Also, make sure your smoke alarms work and get a few carbon monoxide detectors. Also fire extinguishers and make sure you have a plan in case of a fire for various circumstances. A lot of small apartments have the only door next to or in the kitchen and the kitchen is where a lot of fires start. If one happens in the night and suddenly you can't get to your front door, you need to be able to get out quickly another way. To add onto that, get renters insurance and keep a bag packed with some basic stuff like a change of clothes, an old jacket that you don't wear often, copies of important documents (I keep mine on a protected thumb drive), spare keys to your car, some cash, etc. and keep it near your bed. If you need to suddenly leave in the night due to an emergency, or if your neighbour burns popcorn at 3am and your building evacs and you're stick standing around in a parking lot freezing, you'll be glad you have that bag.\n\nLast isn't necessarily for living alone but I like to keep a decent stock of non-perishable goods around. A lot of nights I've come home and realize that I don't have much in my fridge and need to go shopping tomorrow but I can still throw together a really nice pasta and tomato sauce and it's cheap to do to. When I do go shopping I keep an eye out for sales on canned goods (that I actually use) and buy a few or when I just need one of something, I'll grab an extra and keep it in my pantry.\n\nAgain, don't know you but living alone for the first time is often when people learn how to take care of themselves. Take the time to learn to be self-sufficient. Make plans, be responsible, and enjoy the silence.",

Keep your place beautiful, don't let the laundry pile up or the dishes sit dirty in the sink for days.

I’ll eat on it for a day or two, but vacuum seal and freeze the rest. The next time I cook I do the same with pork chops, ham, beef, etc. The end result is for lunch and dinner I can go to the freezer and go “hmm I want tacos and burgers for lunch and dinner tomorrow”, take them out of the freezer and put them in the fridge to thaw, and good to go. \n\nThe flavor is next day leftovers, at worst, but you literally are one freezer bag away from a semi-fresh and tasty non-preserved meal. And it’s cheap AF. We have 2 months of meals for 2 ppl that we rotate so we can have grilled meals in the winter, soup on a cold summer day, etc.  \n\nTo note the things that do NOT work well, IMO, are sides, especially root veggies. Potatoes that are thawed SUCK. Nuke those if you want, but they’re not worth it. They’re gross. Mushrooms are OK if they’re smaller, but carrots and asparagus are mushy nastiness.

When I had one of my first apartments I came home and found my door unlocked on several occasions. The first time I doubted myself.

I changed my lock without permission and ended up getting evicted. Never trust a landlord.\n\nAnother reason for a security system is in case the landlord or one of his workers has to make entry into your apartment. You want to have video evidence of what they do in your apartment. I had this dodgy coke head caretaker who kicked my door in because there was a leak in the apartment below and he claimed he thought I fell asleep in the bathtub.  I don't believe it at all.

If someone ever runs up in your house in the middle of the night, you will have that extra time to get your wits about you. Also, if you have people over and have to run to the store or something, you can feel more comfortable leaving people in your apartment when you are not there. Not that I recommend that.

Having all your stuff burn is dreadful, but it's *so* much worse if you don't have coverage to at least try to replace it.\n\nIf you have a car, talk to your auto insurance company and see if they'll bundle. Even if you don't, it's often like ~$200/yr, which is quite cheap.\n\nDo read the explanation they send you to understand what is and is not covered, and consider getting additional coverage if you have something pricey that isn't covered.\n\nOnce you get everything moved in (or reach a reasonable stopping point; you'll likely have a few boxes that you never unpack), use your phone to record video while walking through your place and looking around. Consider taking high-res pictures of detailed stuff, like books on shelves. Keep a few copies of this in different places - on your phone, in the cloud somewhere, maybe a hard copy at your parents' place or a friend's place - so that it's easier to make a detailed list of all your stuff if it *does* ever burn down or the like. You'll get more from your insurance company if you can be specific in what was lost, but it's pretty hard to list all the books in your collection *after* they're ash.\n\n----\n\nYou know the saying \"measure twice, cut once\"?

While you live alone ya may not notice the stink or smell your apartment takes on with your BO, cooking oils/pans/dishes or how sloppy things get. BUT anyone who comes over will.

Generally speaking, if something is wrong with your apartment your landlord is legally required to fix it. That includes big stuff down to mundane things like changing lightbulbs.\n\nI know a lot of people will say, \"Make your landlord do it, you're already paying them!\" and they have a point. However for many people that means when they finally own something they say, \"Oh...I've never done any of this for myself!\" and the results are often a series of expensive lessons.\n\nAlso worth noting is that in many cases landlords don't *want* you to try to fix shit because let's be honest, a lot of tenants will do a *terrible* job. But this can be absurd, a lot of apartments won't let you install your own showerheads, at least according to your lease. So an important caveat on anything you want to try to fix is, \"Can I make it look like it did before I tried to fix it?\" in case you fuck it up or when you move out.\n\nThat having been said I recommend thinking of things you are interested in learning how to do yourself. My metric is that if I can fix it for less than $20 and an hour of my time I'll almost always try. Some examples over the years have included:\n\n* New showerheads (replacing the old one when I move out)\n\n* Installing GFCI outlets in place of outlets that don't have a ground plug\n\n* Wiring ethernet (the wiring was already run, but for some reason they never put heads on the jacks or plates on the walls??)\n\n* Fixing doors that rub on the frame or are hard to open/close\n\n* Cleaning window tracks/repairing blinds\n\n* Rehanging shelves that were collapsing\n\n* Fixing bathtub drains that drained slowly (note: it actually wasn't a clog!)\n\nNow all that shit is something I could have made my landlord(s) do but obviously not everyone will share my personal passion for DIY.  Obviously don't fuck around with anything you don't understand. I'll do electrical and plumbing shit but only if I can turn off my electricity and water.

You need an smaller bin so you have to take it out a couple times a week.\n\n- Have some big size trash bags around. They are handy when cleaning or getting rid of useless stuff.\n\n- Moving is so fucking problematic. Don't hoard stupid things just because you have free space.

It's far cheaper, you can buy the nice stuff and it'll save you time. French presses are fantastic.\n* Buy glass storage containers, avoid plastic.\n* Get a trash can with a good lid not the cheap plastic ones that only stay closed for the first week.\n* Invest in a good vacuum cleaner.\n* Install weather striping for any drafty windows or doors if heating/cooling is a concern where you live.\n* Don't cheap out on cutting boards, bamboo cutting boards in particular are terrible.\n* Focus on developing good habits immediately; groceries every 1-2 weeks, morning rituals, cooking consistently, making your bed, vacuum weekly, etc.\n* Schedule weekly / bi-weekly hang outs with friends.\n* Be kind to neighbours but don't be a push over.\n* Cleaning supplies, bandages, isopropyl alcohol, sun lotion, aloe vera, goo gone, electrical tape, duct tape, plunger, screw driver set and a hammer are all great things to have.\n* Get a decent flashlight, a pack of batteries, a box of matches and a set of candles for power outages.\n* Always have extra light bulbs, tooth paste, tooth brushes, toilet paper and q-tips.\n* Plan out the organizational patterns of your kitchen. For example anything used to cook with should be close to the stove.\n* Clean as you cook (and do everything else). Preemptive cleanliness is far easier to maintain.\n* Look into coupons or rewards programs at places you shop frequently.\n* Focus on your debts no matter how bad they are. Trust me it's the consistency that matters more than anything so the sooner you start, the better.\n* Mesh drain catches for sinks and the bathtub.\n* Use an old ice cream container or similar to collect any food waste scraps with that you keep in the fridge. You can then make veggie stock with the veggie scraps or compost it appropriately. Bonus is your garbage doesn't stink up the house.\n* Explore new hobbies and learn about yourself.\n* Experiment with doing things completely solo: going to the movies, going for a hike, camping, etc.",

Get the essentials: dish-cleaning soaps, drain un-blocker and other essential cleaning liquids and items, a mop and bucket, a broom, perhaps a dustpan and a brush for small messes. A plunger. Bin bags/liners - whatever you call you them.  \nI’d also invest in one of those plug hole nets to catch food when your preparing dinner. You can stop blockages and prevent bugs from visiting. \n\nGet some tools, an assortment of screwdrivers, pliers, a hammer, a wrench\n\nOh! Bed sheets. Keep your linens clean and get spare sheets and pillow cases. \n\nI cook at home, my girlfriend does a good bit of it too. Don’t be afraid to buy cheap, and to save food for another day. We also ended up chopping meat and storing it in containers. I’m not a fan of cooking chicken and reheating it in particular - so I store it and defrost it before cooking another day. \n\nBe aware of your neighbours, don’t be too loud or aggressive if/when they piss you off - but also don’t be a mug if they are frequently obnoxiously loud. I have a neighbour who’s pretty much a dick to everyone, but we keep cool and he’s been reported a bunch of times. However I get on fine with the rest of them. Nice people. \n\nLastly grow up a bit. By that I mean save money. Make sure your tax, rent, utility bills, phone bill/internet bills are all paid on time and then you will not have many things to worry about. \n\nSave some money for a rainy day and maybe even save some for a holiday you might take one day. I saved £5 a week at first for that holiday - best decision I’ve ever made. Had s lovely break last month after a year without taking a day off or a holiday. \n\nBe bossy and tell yourself no when shopping for things you want- my first year I wasted a bit of money because I wanted things and I still haven’t used them.

Some clothing items require high temperatures, and some you shouldn't dry in the dryer.\n\n4) Learn how to cook. Good tasting food doesn't need to be expensive. There are plenty of good youtubers for this e.g Binging with Babish\n\n5) If you want to save money you can buy secondhand furniture. Avoid mattresses though; you don't want bedbugs. \n\n6) Learn to enjoy your own company and do stuff by yourself.

That’s cause I was upstairs and felt bad.. so even if your up stairs definitely vacuume at least once a week maybe 2 times a month. I mean move coaches etc.. takes maybe 30 mins and will be worth it. Other mistake I made was never really telling my friends and family how I felt, I got\nSuper depressed.. so if you are alone and feel alone ask for help. Then don’t eat out all the time, making a meal for your self that you made is so much fulfilling than wasting gas and money to get food. Then the last mistake I made was never really talking to neighbors..even when they invited me over to hang out I never did. I never was in a situation where I needed a neighbor but better to be safe than sorry. \nOn a positive note it’s nice to have your own place where after a long day at work you can Jsut come home and lay around and don’t have to worry about a roommate, gf or whoever being there.

Biggest things I’ve learnt are\n 1) don’t try to do everything at once. You can do things over multiple days, trying to get it all done at once caused me a lot of stress especially when you try doing it after work. \n2) don’t buy too much food, I went through a stage of not being able to eat everything and throwing away a fair bit. \n3) If you feel lonely, get outside, reach out. Whatever helps do it, it’s important for your mental health. At first I found it very lonely as it is a big change and it’s okay to talk about that. Covid lockdowns didn’t help but do what you can.\n4) If your place is unfurnished, don’t cheap out too much on furniture if you can, it’ll be yours for years to come so may as well get some good things :)",

            "text": "It's been a while, so I'm going to tell you everything I'd tell myself if I have to live alone again:\n\n1) Put all of your trash in a can before bed. All of it. Beer cans, food boxes, snack containers, yes. Just do it. If your trash is full, just take it out. It takes a minute. And put a new bag in the can. Going to bed 3 minutes later won't make a difference, and your house won't stink, and people won't walk in and immediately judge you.\n\n2) Do NOT put all of your leftovers down the garbage disposer. It's not called a dispose-all. If you put too much pasta in it, it will clog, and you will have to deal with it and possibly call a plumber who will condescendingly explain that it's not a dispose-all, but a dispose-er, because it does not \"dispose all.\" This happened this year.\n\n3) Buy a plunger (backpaking on everying who said this). Just because you haven't clogged a toilet doesn't mean your guests won't. Also, always have backup toilet paper. Even if you have one roll left, it better be sitting next to that giant bag of extra TP. In fact, never buy something when you run out. Buy it beforehand, otherwise you have to convince a guest to use paper towels instead, and then you totally need that plunger.\n\n4) Everything is your fault. Don't get deep with this, it just means you can not blame a roommate for anything. Dishes in the sink? Yours. Laundry in the washing machine instead of a hamper? Yours. All of it is yours. So treat it like you have a roommate who will bitch at you. Wash your shit. It's just a good habit.\n\n5) While cooking, clean as you go. If something's got a few minutes of simmering, or boiling, just wash everything that you no longer need. I hand wash all of my things, because our dishwasher floods our kitchen when used. If that's not an issue, scrape the chunks off of your prep-work, and load it, and run it before you go to sleep. And, again, don't put too much pasta down the sink. You will get mocked by a local handyman (fuck you, Greg).\n\n6) Your shower. Close the curtain when you get out, and wipe it down every now and then. Others here can give you a timeframe, but once a month is fine. Get a cup of soapy water, and an extra cup to rinse it off with. You can fill the extra cup in the shower. Don't let black shit appear in your shower.\n\n7) You're alone now. Enjoy the solitude, but don't let it be your life. You're alone, and also 9 cats away from becoming crazy (assuming you own 0 cats). Make time for your friends, but don't be afraid to stay in and have some alone time. 1 cat can help, but that brings in new issues:\na)scoop that box daily. Yes, daily.\nb) move water away from their food. They just like it further away.\nc) if that cat pees on the carpet, vinegar will kill the smell.\n\n8) Anything you are curious about or don't know, you can youtube or google it. Look at more than one result for each one and find a common ground for any issue you have.\n\n9) Drink more water. Doesn't have anything to do with living alone, but a lot of people need to drink more water.\n\n10) Buy tools. Hammer, screwdrivers, small ratchet set (metric and imperial), and an allen-wrench multi-tool, because too much shit uses it.\n\n11) Have fun.\n\n12) Put your toilet paper on the stupid thing. Don't just have it next to you. It's lazy, and you're better than that.",

If you can find washable, cut to fit air filters you'll save money. Plus you'll always have one on hand if you cut two, and clean the dirty one once you replace it with a clean one.\n\nLearn to cook. Cook often. You don't have to get fancy. Just cook things you'll finish. \n\nIf you get a pet, vacuum and dust twice as often as you think you need to. Your place will smell better to guests, and stay much cleaner.\n\nTake your trash out after three days, full or not.\n\nA good mattress is worth more than a nice TV. Your body will thank you. You'll rest better. Change your sheets once a week. Get two sets so you don't fall into the 'i don't have time to wash it' mentality.\n\nDo laundry once you've got two loads.

Be willing to spend money on furniture if you can. I was a cheapskate when it came to that stuff, and only recently have been willing to spend more on furniture that won't get thrown away when I move.\n\n4.

If you can't do a viewing, don't start unloading until you've gone through the apartment and taken photos. Make sure you get nooks and crannies, in the closets, even the heating/ac if you have access to that.\n\n2.) Get documentation for EVERY. SINGLE. VISIT. that the property manager or maintenance has to perform. If you don't have a receipt, they were never there.\n\n3.) Make sure you investigate the property. Are there any reports about maintenance being delayed/taking multiple visits? Bugs? Noises? Heat/ac issues? \n\n4.) When you move in you should get an inspection sheet. FILL IT OUT. MAKE A COPY FOR YOURSELF. Literally will save so much hassle if you do that. Don't let them sign it complete unless everything has been completed. Same as #2, get a work receipt for every item on the list. If you don't have a receipt, they never did it. \n\n5.) Make sure you know where your local food/gas places are.
