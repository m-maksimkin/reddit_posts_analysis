    "How is it that the penis and balls don't get crushed/squished when walking, sitting down and having someone else sit in between the legs?\nHow is it that the penis and balls don't fall off? They keep dangling, right? If a man walks around naked, there's something dangling, and swinging loosely on his body. Wouldn't that make walking itself painful?\n\nWhat about when wearing underwear and pants? They squeeze the penis and balls, wouldn't that be painful?\n\nWhat about sitting down? Or worse, having someone else (e.g. a partner) sit down in between the legs? If the penis is in between the legs, and someone else's bottoms sit on it to fit in between the legs or on top of the legs, wouldn't that be painful?\n\nWhat about crossing legs while seated? That would squeeze the penis and balls more than pants and underwear do, right? How is that not painful?\n\nNote: I'm a woman and am just curious.": [

It might seem like a minimal difference, but it's what keeps it from getting crushed.\n\nSit down with your legs closed, then take an object and put right between your legs. You won't be sitting on it either. Weirdest sentence I ever told a strange woman, but here we are.\n\nSecond, when the penis is flaccid, not only does it take less space, it also \"molds\" comfortably. It really doesn't dangle all that much, specially if you're a \"grower\", not a \"shower\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What about when wearing underwear and pants? They squeeze the penis and balls, wouldn't that be painful?\n\nFemale underwear and pants are ***significantly*** tighter than ours. You need to remember that our pants are made with a penis in mind, so there's extra room around the crotch area.\n\nEven male skinny jeans aren't as bad as female jeans. As for the underwear, even form fitting boxer briefs wrap the body snuggly - it doesn't *compress* too much, since it's fairly elastic.\n\nLots of women out there enjoy wearing male underwear for this reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What about crossing legs while seated? That would squeeze the penis and balls more than pants and underwear do, right? How is that not painful?\n\nIt's more the balls, than the penis, because again, the penis isn't directly between our legs.\n\nEven then, not every guy has this issue, only some. Hence why some guys \"manspread\".\n\nEDIT: Rip my inbox.\n\nTo address some points made in the replies below:\n\n* Yes, testicles sit at different heights. Good point.\n* If your underwear still feels too tight, consider checking the size first, then read what fabrics it's made from. There are elastic materials added to certain fabrics, to make them wrap around your body more comfortably. Far from me to judge how you choose to envelop your magnum dong, but perhaps there's a heavenly underwear out there for you, just waiting to be discovered.\n* I didn't know about \"manspreading\" also happening because of hip proportions. Considering I'm a guy with fairly wide hips who can comfortably cross my legs to sit, I guess that makes sense. I just thought you guys had large balls.",

They're attached pretty solidly for an organ that hangs off and are contained in an extremely elastic sac.  \n\n2. Walking totally naked *can* be uncomfortable depending on a variety of factors. Mostly, though, I'd say there no pain without some moderate amount of physical activity like jogging.  \n\n3. As someone farther down said men's clothing are cut differently so we have a bit more room. You can compress a flaccid penis quite a bit without pain and the testes have room to move around/be moved around which leads into...  \n\n4. We move them. Out from under us, tuck them between our legs, move them if something is about to sit/fall/crash into our lap, etc. If you and your partner sit that way a lot you'll move yourself into the best position for long term contact and allow for some wiggle room.  \n\n5. I sit with my legs crossed more often than not. Though generally everything gets positioned so there's no compression but sometimes if I sit in a hurry then, yes, there can be discomfort and a quick adjustment in that case makes life good again. I'd say that it isn't painful sitting that way because we don't tend to let ourselves get hurt since we have a lifetime of habit protecting us from just sitting down on our balls.   \n\n\ntl;dr: They're slightly on the front of our body, we move them out of the way when needed, our clothes fit differently, and we reflexively protect them during activities that might cause injury.",

The scrotum doesn't usually bounce.\n\n> What about when wearing underwear and pants? They squeeze the penis and balls, wouldn't that be painful?\n\nI personally wear loose pants, so nothing ever gets squeezed. But pants in general accommodate for the sexual organ with some space.\n\n> What about sitting down? Or worse, having someone else (e.g. a partner) sit down in between the legs? If the penis is in between the legs, and someone else's bottoms sit on it to fit in between the legs or on top of the legs, wouldn't that be painful?\n\nThe penis is *above* the legs when you are sitting down. Also, when you are dressed, it usually lies against the belly, vertical.\n\n> What about crossing legs while seated? That would squeeze the penis and balls more than pants and underwear do, right? How is that not painful?\n\nThis is actually true for me. Crossing legs is uncomfortable, so I don't do it. If you notice, very few men cross their legs while sitting. So yes, in my experience it is slightly painful.\n\nI hope to have added something that wasn't said before :)",

However, if you wear wider clothes you'll have the problem from above with your testes slapping your thighs. A lot of companies have also foregone making clothes for the average male and opted to make too tight clothing. A lot of men's pants I've seen the last years looked more like they were made for a woman than for a man. \n\nCrossing legs is painful most of the time, however most men learned to live with the pain.

It's completely okay to not know things and be curious and ask to find out. I didn't write this to make fun of you, I wrote it because to someone who has a penis, that's roughly how ridiculous this line of thinking is. Not from someone who doesn't have one, but in general. Penis owners don't ponder why things don't get in their way anymore than you ponder why your fingers don't do the same.\n\nNo, penises don't work like that. They don't swing wildly when we're naked. They aren't squeezed when we sit down. Things don't crush them. Everyday life isn't painful. The fingers thing was a joke, but it's not that far off. Crossing your arms doesn't affect your fingers. Crossing your legs doesn't affect your genitals.\n\nOur clothing is built differently. Flaccid penises know how to not get in the way and generally go unnoticed. When you open your legs wide, especially if you're sitting down and have gravity's assistance, balls will generally sink very slightly between the legs. But these are quite soft organs that are closely connected to the rest of the body, so as you bring your legs closer together, they'll come back up. It's a very slight adjustment.\n\nNow, genitals can get uncomfortable. They can shift into weird positions, pinch against clothing or a hair or whatever, get sticky from sweat and stick to clothes or your legs, and yes, can be a tad uncomfortable occasionally when someone sits on your lap. But this is very, very rarely painful, and doesn't happen all the time either. So it just takes a small adjustment of the pants to quickly fix it. If someone is sitting on my lap and it gets uncomfortable, chances are I'll be able to adjust myself and fix it without them even noticing. No penis touching required. Evolution is pretty good at figuring out how to let it sit in the ideal position to not get crushed, so if someone is sitting on me and it's uncomfortable, often all it will take is a quick leg shift to fix it. It's like adjusting your bra strap.",

They keep dangling, right? \n\nWell it is attached to the body and the skin is formed around it, okay imagine if your 'lips' grew over something and they fused together that's exactly what happens with boys when developing that's why some men have a vertical line going down the middle of their sack, it is the fusion line.\n\n>Wouldn't that make walking itself painful?\n\nNo, while men don't have hips as wide as women we still have a 'thigh gap' but that space is filled. Also, the penis and balls don't go as far behind as the vagina does, the penis is more 'in front' of the body and the balls are between the legs.\n\n>What about when wearing underwear and pants? They squeeze the penis and balls, wouldn't that be painful?\n\nI was guessing that it is similar to a bra in that some like to wear one and others don't (some guys go commando) and like a bra it is uncomfortable when it is too tight and when it is too loose, but that's why there's different sizes.\n\n>What about sitting down? Or worse, having someone else (e.g. a partner) sit down in between the legs? If the penis is in between the legs, and someone else's bottoms sit on it to fit in between the legs or on top of the legs, wouldn't that be painful?\n\nGuys can sit on their balls, and yes it is super painful to do so. The penis while sensitive isn't as sensitive as the balls so if someone sits on a guy's lap and he immediately jumps up in pain it is either because you sat on his erection when it was in an uncomfortable position when he was trying to hide it or you moved his balls under where he was sat/sat on his balls if his legs were open. \n\n>What about crossing legs while seated? That would squeeze the penis and balls more than pants and underwear do, right? How is that not painful?\nSome guys have wider hips than others so for some it is more comfortable to have their legs open (this is why the term manspreading is sexist because men are just sitting comfortably.) and others find it more comfortable to cross their legs and when they do there is usually enough space for their dick to go.",

It just does its thing, barely noticeable most of the day. However, this changes when the \"Instaboner\" pops up, making it more uncomfortable to sit.\n\nThankfully, natural design has mitigated much of this issue by creating our legs to be a \"pocket\" when they're closer together. As for the penis, it sort of sits outside the pocket, while the balls are a bit protected.\n\nUnfortunately, this design has one shit negative side effect: sweat. No matter how loose our pants or underwear, sweat is going to form and it's going to make things sticky. So sticky at times, things just tend not to want to move freely. It's one of the reasons I despise humid days.\n\nAs male, I cannot understand for the life of me why we don't wear skirts.

There are way more nerve endings in the testicles than the penis, since testicles are the “fertile” part of a man and produce sperm. Sitting down doesn’t hurt unless we close our legs together, since when a man sits down his balls will naturally fall down between our legs, especially on a hot day when the scrotum is loose. Squishing a penis does not hurt, some men even find it pleasurable. \nHaving someone sit between our legs usually depends on how far back they sit. Even if they sit all the way back, the structure of a man’s crotch is in such a way that the balls reside in a concave structure that prevents discomfort from pressure\nCrossing legs while seated usually doesn’t hurt too much, but more often than not will result in the balls and the penis being pushed upwards, above both thighs\nThe same sort of thing can be seen when a man is walking or running, where the penis and balls are pushed forwards in front of both thighs. The other thing worth mentioning is that when a man runs, usually their scrotum retracts and doesn’t let the balls move around that much (source: I’m a runner)",

If a man walks around naked, there's something dangling, and swinging loosely on his body. Wouldn't that make walking itself painful?\n\nNo, the balls and dick are not directly between the legs, they are a bit ahead. Not by much, but enough. Walking is not painful, and unless you have monster genitals, they do dangle, but not swing.\n\nWhat about when wearing underwear and pants? They squeeze the penis and balls, wouldn't that be painful?\n\nDepends on the type of underwear a guy uses. I personally like using boxers, because its like not wearing anything at all, except that they are made of a softer material so my stuff doesnt scrape along the hard denim and zipper of my jeans. I only use boxer-briefs for exercise, and i do feel they are a bit tight, but that is the point of the athletic types. You definitely dont want to pull or damage anything down there due to lack of proper support.\n\nI am sure those who wear casual briefs or boxer-briefs prefer the extra support. Personally boxer-briefs suck because the legs always ride up your thigh where they look like briefs with extra fabric. And briefs just give you a wedgie.\n\n>What about sitting down? Or worse, having someone else (e.g. a partner) sit down in between the legs? If the penis is in between the legs, and someone else's bottoms sit on it to fit in between the legs or on top of the legs, wouldn't that be painful?\n\nKinda goes back to the whole, they are in the sweet spot past your legs, but not too far out. There is a thing called manspreading, and its because of the balls. We spread our legs to a near 90 degree angle taking up all the room next to us. Its the best on a hot day and the balls have been sticking to your leg due to the sweat.\n\nAnd a flaccid dick kinda just moves around. So if a partner sits on you, they would have to have quite the bony ass, and actively seeking to damage the goods.\n\n>What about crossing legs while seated? That would squeeze the penis and balls more than pants and underwear do, right? How is that not painful?\n\nI do yoga, and this one was hard at first. Yes, they would always get squeezed by the combined compression of my stomach and thighs. Eventually, i stopped using athletic underwear that kept my stuff in place and used my regular boxers. This allowed them to dangle, this they would just tuck under the thighs when needed, or theyd sit on top of my thighs when needed.\n\n>Note: I'm a woman and am just curious.\n\nI figured. That or you were a dude in a situation where dont have balls and/or a penis.",

We constantly adjust them throughout the day. \n\nSome noteworthy ball events:\n\nStanding up from a sitting position - the balls stick to the side of my thigh, I pull it off so I get breathing room\n\nWhen going to sit, I usually have to \"hop\" so it will move out of the way\n\nWalking up the stairs causes them to slap my butt/thigh\n\nI wear briefs when I run for the same reason that women wear sport bras\n\nPenis:\n\nPenis does hang out with the balls but when not hard, it just goes with the flow. It doesn't seems to have the problems that balls generally do. \n\nThe issue arises when it gets hard. No I am not horny. It just randomly gets hard throughout the the day. Tight fitting pants are the worst, so I don't wear them. It can get in the way when moving through tight spaces, I just push it down and move through. Like when passing by in a movie theater. \n\nHope it helps.",

Wouldn't that make walking itself painful?\n\nThey don't fall off for the same reason your arms don't fall off. I think we've gotten used to having a dick and balls that the we don't even notice the feeling while walking around. I'd assume the same way you don't notice your breasts(?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What about when wearing underwear and pants? They squeeze the penis and balls, wouldn't that be painful?\n\nAs long as they aren't too tight, no. I've worn jeans my whole life and I gotta say it gets annoying having my dick and one ball go to the right side of the seam/zipper and another ball to the left. Looks like a male camel toe. I was embarrassed throughout high school then when  I grew up I realized it's normal to have a dick and balls and let them do whatever they want. It's not painful in clothes that aren't too tight though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What about sitting down?\n\nThis can definitely hurt at times. I have to adjust my balls every now and then to make sure they can breathe and aren't squished too tightly between my thighs. Again, when I was younger I was embarrassed to adjust them in public, but now that I'm in my late twenties I realized it's normal to have a dick and balls so I tug 'em around until they're in the right position. Usually isn't that difficult to do unless I haven't noticed I've been sitting on them awkwardly for a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Or worse, having someone else (e.g. a partner) sit down in between the legs?\n\nYeah this generally isn't great, especially if she decides she wants to hop in my lap without giving me any warning or time to adjust my dick and balls so she doesn't crack them open like a couple of eggs. So my advice, if you're going to sit down on your boyfriend's lap; reach behind you, grab his dick and balls for him and move them up and a bit to the side and gently lower your back onto him. But then you've got the problem of getting him exited, so just come in slowly so he can do that himself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What about crossing legs while seated? \n\nNo man has ever done that in the existence of the XY chromosome combination.\n\nBut yes it is uncomfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm a woman and am just curious\n\nI hope you can use this information in your future endeavors.",

Also if the formatting is weird or there are any typos I'm on the phone and I'm ok at typing on phone at best\n\n1) How is it that it doesn't get squashed?\n    Becouse of the same thing that causes manspreading, our bone structure is different from womens. When you're walking your dick isn't inbetween your legs, it's out in front a bit (also it hangs way higher than you think it does, remember that for later. It's also the reason why some guys (along with lack of experience) can't find the hole by themselves, women have it sitting lower than men). The underwear also helps it a bit by holding it in place. When we sit it isn't inbetween our thighs, it sits a bit higher and falls in that crevase or whatever between them (thighs are cyllindrical-ish).\n    And it isn't big enough to cause tugging, if you aren't naked it will be staying still in your underwear and if you are naked it wouldn't be that much swinging (a soft dick is usually like a couple inches at most, I don't know, unless you got a hung guy) as if it would matter if you're already naked. And clothes won't squish it if they're the right size, only small clothes squish (not skinny fit jeans, small as in the wrong size). Men's pants are designed with that in mind\n\n2) Sitting down and having somebody on the lap?\n    Manspreading. Our bones are made so they spread automatically to accomodate a few parts that are out there so we spread legs subconsciously.\n    For sitting on the lap, as I said it sits so high that it doesn't get squished by thighs but it also sits just so low that it's flush with the top of our thighs for protection. That's of course while it's soft. Also while it's ft it's small and not as sensitive. While it's hard you are gonna feel it poke you and it gets really uncomfortable (not painful, just uncomfortable)\n\n3) Crossed legs while seated?\n    That should be a war crime lol, our hips will do their best to separate the legs. You can get a solid few secs before you give up and assume the comfortable position (not all guys but this whole reply is a big broad generalisation). The most crossing that you're gonna get with most guys is ankle on the knee. Pants and underwear won't squeeze it unless they're small (or the guy is hung as an elephant) so there's no issue with it",

            "text": "I think most of the comments have addressed the main things here, but I just wanted to point out that the penis is attached to the front of your groin, not between the legs. The balls start immediately underneath the penis, and do hang between the legs while walking/standing. The classic 'male sidestep' is because the scrotum has stuck to one leg or the other, so we take one extra wide step to let them detach and swing freely. However when you sit, your balls are between your legs and could potentially get squished, but most guys are good at sitting down in such a way that it doesn't happen. Men also have as bit of a thigh gap, which gives extra space when sitting.\n\nSomething else to mention is that the balls can pull up into the body, or dangle down. There are a number of different factors that affect the hanging position, including temperature, arousal, stress, and other things. The muscle that controls that movement is called the cremaster (pronounced \"cream master\", there's a fun fact for you). Some people can control it manually as well. When the sack is sucked in, there's not a whole lot exposed to get crushed. When it's extended, it hangs down. If you cross your legs while it's extended, you just need to adjust yourself so that they are underneath your raised leg, and next to your lower leg. The sack itself is very flexible and the balls can move freely within it, so as long as the testicles themselves don't get clamped down on, you won't really feel any pain.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that the penis is very different when flaccid than erect. When flaccid it's much smaller, softer and more flexible. It doesn't really matter if it gets squished a bit. If it is erect, it usually points up toward your bellybutton or to the side, and won't interfere with your legs.\n\nEveryone has a different preference, but imo the best men's underwear is both loose yet supportive. Like a little hammock they can rest in, but still move around a little. Also worth mentioning that you can squeeze your testicles surprisingly hard without causing genuine pain. You can squeeze your penis and scrotum (not the testicles themselves, just the skin sack) as hard as you can without causing almost any pain. But please don't do any squeezing/tugging without being explicitly asked.",
