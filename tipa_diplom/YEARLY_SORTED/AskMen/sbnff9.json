I even try to make small talk like, ‚ÄúWow, this is really insane, huh?‚Äù And she would just grunt in reply. Near the end of the doc, she wordlessly tries to take off my pants as the narrator is talking about some truly heinous shit, and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so sure this is the mood.‚Äù \n\nShe suggests we go to the bedroom in as few words as linguistically possible, and my dumb ass goes along with it. We make out, and it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ weird‚Ä¶ like not just bad. It‚Äôs weiiiird bad. Like she was so stiff as if she was scrunching all the muscles in her face, but she looked completely relaxed and kinda dead eyed. It was like kissing a mannequin. Things progress to the point where we are both basically unclothed, but it‚Äôs still super weird. She‚Äôs on top and asks ‚ÄúYou wanna do this?‚Äù and I say ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù She replies to that with ‚ÄúWell just because you do doesn‚Äôt mean that I do.‚Äù At that point, I see the escape hatch from this free falling aircraft of Twilight Zone level bizarreness and say ‚ÄúHey, that‚Äôs totally cool.

No joke, an hour. Finally I just say that it‚Äôs kinda late and I‚Äôm sorry if I wasted her time. She proceeds to get MEGA upset that I ‚Äústrung her along,‚Äù and barges out of my apartment, leaving behind her socks, a scrunchy, and a $20 bill.

Also, she had gotten a different car, which was standard shift, and she sucked at driving it. So on top of her generally shitty driving, weaving in and out of traffic, etc, she also stalled in the middle of multiple intersections.  Like, pulling out of the mall, 4 lanes in all directions, stalls right in the middle.

Throwaway and some details obfuscated and swapped around because it could seriously hamper my career in a country I plan on returning to. \n\nI meet this mad cute girl at college a little older than the rest of her class, (but not by much a couple of years), a couple years my junior. I'm already the old guy at college because I had to work to support myself and my family. I'm just about to graduate with a <redacted> part time. She's legit one of the hottest people I've ever met, she's really funny, smart, confident, magnetic, and man the banter. We're just vibing, you know? She has the sexiest accent which she slowly drops after a week of knowing her and passes it off as a quirky joke. I think it's kinda loopy and funny and quirky so I go with it. I only ever meet her with a couple of mutual friends once then after we hang out between work and classes for me and classes for her. I can't even describe how well we clicked. She had a real talent for grabbing my attention ways that were really heady, like grabbing me by a belt loop with a tiny bit of a tug I could barely feel until I realized what it was and then she'd turn me around. I'd never had a woman try to keep and command my attention with confidence, and it was totally my type of thing as it turns out. She's very, very confident and not afraid to show it, and not in an obnoxious way either. We're both older than our peers, both the oldest of three, both the opposite gender from our siblings. Wow. We both comment about what a genuine surprise meeting each other has been, how we weren't expecting it, etc.\n\nShe says she works as a therapist on Sundays. I think wow okay. I know you can take a course/certification to become a counselor of some sort and I mention that. And she goes yeah you know your stuff. I say damn look at you.\n\nShe claims to have take regular fencing and kickboxing classes and have 'belts' and trophies in them, and she was fit but not that fit but why would someone lie about that? Color me impressed, that's hot. I just go hiking and occasionally climbing, work generally keeps me active. She does that too! I say we should go sometime soon to a place nearby I love going to. \n\nI mention friends who're premeds taking their USMLE's (a med test to work in the US as a doctor) and how hard they're working, and she's like 'oh I took those too, got a 92'. Wow really? I say damn you're in <*a completely unrelated field*> how come you did that? Don't you have to be a premed or something to...? 'Oh my AP high school grades were so good you know, so they just let me take it, I just had to take SAT tests, blah blah'. And I think damn she seems mad smart so maybe, what do I know? I'm not a STEM major. We start making out and I don't think about it again. (Really each time these things come up it ends with some sort of distraction in retrospect.) Why would someone lie about that? It never even occurs to me.\n\nWe hook up, and it's amazing. A little scratchy though? I express some mild discomfort but not much because it's the first time I don't want to not vibe with her. I dunno, I go with it I guess it's not that big a deal, mostly amazing. Half way through, she asks me if I'd be okay with *blood play*, which sobers me up pretty instantly, (not trying to kinkshame I swear) I say uhhh I've never tried that maybe we can ease into it next time and discuss it beforehand? She sighs and says sure, and *completely* checks out and I ask if that's a problem and she instantly comes back (this goes very quick), and says no no of course not. I ask if she's sure, sorry I just wasn't expecting it, I've had a thing with needles since I was a kid. She says 'No, no you're fine, maybe I can help you get over it? hahaha' She sees my expression and laughs some more. It's cute, I feel a little relieved, I laugh, that's obviously a joke, we make jokes, we're communicating. It's fine. It's great, we get back to it, it's awesome. Amazing. It's fine no issue, I love this, she keeps me on my toes. What guy wouldn't want someone who knows what they want?\n\nCouple of days after, her dad comes to visit her at the campus, and mutual friends give me a heads up, because she doesn't mention it as I'm leaving to go see her, she had asked me to come for a late lunch or something the day before. I think no big deal she's probably just busy talking to him, I don't know I don't think about it. I'm nervous because I'm coming from work and want to make a good impression. I meet her dad, and we talk for like a half hour, he's clearly also dressed like he's coming from work, he just 'decided to drop in', and we get along, I think it goes well. It starts off a little awkward, he's a little standoffish, but I'm eager to please and easy to like (or so I'm told) and it goes over well. I guess it's okay was bound to happen eventually. Feels a little fast. We've been dating a week and a half.\n\nWe make a plan to go on a hike/climb, I'm excited, and she agrees but gradually she seems less so. I ask if she still wants to go, and she says 'yes of course, don't worry I really want to go I'm just tired. I'll see you tomorrow knotsalike!'\n\nI go over to a premed guy bestie's place and I'm just fawning all day. It's been 3 weeks we've been dating/seeing each other properly. Feels a little fast for me but it's also amazing I say. I'm talking about her and I mention the med exams and he goes 'uhhh. I don't think... what? That's not how that works. Just think about it for a second.' And I do and I think out loud I guess it's weird but is it impossible? 'It's *extremely* unlikely if not impossible'. \n\nI think about it some more and... there were a bunch things that just don't line up. Places she says she's been, her 'gap years', her Dad 'dropping in', realizing some mutual friends had really been cornering me to ask some weird prying questions about how it was going, etc. \n\nNext morning she messages me saying (I hope this doesn't give it away, I'll try and obfuscate and paraphrase, and leave out some exchanges for clarification, which she almost entirely ignored, but I gotta leave some bits in because of how mad it was):\n\nHer: I'm not a morning person, but you are so... Hi. I have to tell you since I'm the <Cabinet Member in the current government in charge of your field and current and future career here>'s daughter (her name fits and I realize she's probably telling the truth), we have to be careful how we meet and where, my dorm and phones etc are likely to be tapped and I don't want what we do to be used against him, really they could have recorded us already (?!), so we can't meet at my dorm or your place, I'd rather meet at motels or at friend's places or in public, with lots of people and mutual friends around.\n\nKnotsalike: 'Okay. I understand. But this doesn't sound like we'd meet that often to just you know go on dates or adventures or spend time together? Can we talk about this in person before or after our hike today? Do you still want to go?\n\nHer: I don't feel up to going sorry. If you want to be with me, best place is about campus, so I want you to get <another degree/different major that'd take a few more years> here and stay. I'll help you pay for it eventually and we can pull some strings so it goes smoothly. My dad has connections.\n\nKnotsalike: Look I really need to talk to you in person because this is going so fast I feel very confused and a little overwhelmed.\n\nHer: Okay let's meet tomorrow. \n\nKnotsalike: Don't you have work tomorrow? \n\nHer: I've cancelled it.\n\nKnostalike: Okay. See you then.\n\nI tell my friend. He tells me to gtfo and we both agree it has to be as calmly as possible so I don't make an enemy out of a <Cabinet member in charge of my domain of expertise>. I'm fucked. I'm so stupid.\n\nI say I can't do the extra time at college because of family obligations, she tries to convince me I'll be better off, and I hadn't mentioned before that my mother was ill (which is the truth but she's much better now and even at the time), and she's disappointed and says she understands and then breaks up with me.\n\nLater I find out from mutual friends, goes to therapy on Sundays (not a therapist), had one sibling, *not* two and was the youngest (I don't know how this was going to work long term?!?!?!), didn't do basically everything she told me about. She basically lied about everything except who her dad was. She told her father that she had found the guy she was going to marry, who immediately freaked out and had been trying to argue her down from getting her heart set on some guy she only just met unsuccessfully, so he came to see who the hell I was. I think he may have been a little relieved I don't want to assume but I don't think this was a person with great judgement.\n\nANYWAY. A few months later she messages me for what must have been a booty call or some attempt to reconnect with pictures of her posing half naked next to me while I'm *fully asleep* in bed, saying we looked good together and (paraphrased) could probably sell tickets. I gray rocked to the pictures, lied and said I was seeing someone, that I couldn't have them on my phone, so please don't send any more, I'm sorry, and never heard from her again. Frankly she freaks me out because of how blindsided I felt and I realized that she was pushing things constantly. Saw her with her husband or boyfriend or someone from across the room once years later and had a cordial wave and that's it.\n\nTLDR: I date a pathological liar who turns out *is* the daughter of the head of the government body in charge of my field, wants to cut me and herself in bed, and she tried to convince me to get an extra degree/change my major to stay longer with her at college.",

Turns out that 18 years of hardcore suppression made her want to try everything and anything as this was the first time either of our parents had ever left us alone with \"a friend\". First night she stayed she woke me up with her hand down my pants and lying naked in my bad. She stayed in the basement and had to actively pass my parents open room to get to me and the clothes were off before she even left the basement. That set the tone.\nSo she stayed for 1 week and we performed an A-Z sex tutorial that was weaker than the dollar store clearance bin. \nShe proposed to me 11 times. 3 times during sex, once of which was quite public if you had a keen eye. \n\nNow she is quite popular on pornhub and ill just leave it at that.",

She then starts telling me how her cousin wants a rebound guy and I am really her type, she really drove that part home I was \"definitely her cousins type\". So teen horniness gave in and we went out to meet her at her parents house before we left for a party. We get there and everything is cool she's super cute, blonde hair, blue eyes chemistry etc. We go inside to smoke a lil  even though parents were home, they didn't care. After about 10 min in her room I heard someone speaking very loud and forcefully from another part of the house, not yelling just intense. I ask wtf is that and cousin girl says thats just her dad reading a speech mynfriend seemed unfazed, weird but ok. Then I noticed its not in english but german...then it hits me this dude is reciting a hitler speech while walking around the house. Now mind you this was in the pacific northwest of the US. I excuse myself to use the bathroom, kinda freaking out. On my way I see dad in his office that was decorated with random WW II memorabilia and not from the winning side. Then it hits me, my friend was saying I was  definitely her cousins type because I was a 6'3 pale, blue eyed, light haired dude of Austrian and Irish decent. I got to the bathroom kinda sick like how do I get out of here, should I just leave? Then I started thinking about all the young men, who were pretty much my age at the time who fought and died in WW II and if they had the chance to bang a hot, probably crazy, definitely racist Fr√§ulein would they? The answer to me was yes, sadly they never got the chance to, but tonight I do. So I decided to smile nod and go along with whatever the night brought so I could do the dirty. And it worked out well, I gave it everything I had, but not for me, but for america, ok for me too, I was pretty horny.\n\nTLDR: Looked past crazy nazi loving racist to get laid.",

Also sorry for the long post.\n\n10 years ago I met this woman on Facebook after she suddenly messaged me stating that she has \"heard about me\" from various people around the city and she thought I was \"super hot\". After being cheated on and being left by my ex this was an insane confidence boost for me, especially seeing how attractive this woman was.  \n\nSo anyways as we're messaging back and forth she goes on to tell me that she's engaged but wants to leave her cheating fiance because he just gave her Chlamydia. \n\nAt that very moment I had a decision to make. Most may say this type of decision is an easy one; just end the conversation there. She is, after all, engaged and on top of that she has an STD.\n\nWeeeelllllll, 22 year old me was focused on stacking as many bodies as I possibly can(young men, DO NOT do this. It's a horrible way to live) to \"get back\" at my ex. Sooooooo, I told her to come over and we had sex. Unprotected. \n\nOf course I contracted Chlamydia but somehow this girl had connections at a major pharmacy that had given her two free prescriptions of azithromycin. I never questioned how she got these free but 32 year old me is drawing conclusions as I type this.  \n\nSo, 12 days later the antibiotics did their job fully and I became clean. I swore off having sex with this woman forever aaaaaaaannnnnnddddd somehow I ended up inside of her again. Repeatedly. Not just with her but a large amount of other women.\n\nI just want to add for the young men reading this that it's important to not focus on getting as much sex as possible from as many women you can. Believe me when I say, it's not a fulfilling experience and you'll just be left wanting more of something that will leave you empty. On top of that you'll possibly be hurting a lot of women in the process of you jumping around. \n\nGet to know yourself as a man and focus on your purpose. If you don't know your purpose, find it by working and trying new things. Don't become complacent in your current situation because it's physically pleasing. Learn to let go of past hurt and work towards a greater future, for even doing that you may eventually meet the person that you can have fulfilling and meaningful sex with.\n\nTl;dr: knowingly had unprotected sex with a woman who had Chlamydia. Got cured then continued to have sex with her along with other women. Learned from my mistakes because it was never worth it.",

The first bar we went to I was sitting at the counter when the bartender gave me a beer stating it was from the woman on the other end of the bar.  Confused I gave her a wave of appreciation before continuing my conversation about the deadly implications that would occur if Pokemon were real.  She then approached me directly and we had a conversation about random nonsense topics for the next hour or so before getting a taxi together.  Since then we've gotten married and had two kids.  I know kids aren't *technically* an STD but I swear to god nothing has ever made my head pound any more, I haven't gotten a full night's sleep in two years, and nothing I do seems to make them go away.

During a dinner at their house, when everyone momentarily got up he promised to kill me if he caught me trying to have sex with her. Well, I was a horny and depressed teenager so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. He ended up coming home from work one day while we were hooking up in her room. The dog started barking so I jumped off the bed and slid under it. The tile was cold on my hairless nuts. He came in and sensed something was up. Motherfucker checked her pulse as she was laying there and immediately said ‚ÄúWhere is he‚Äù in is thick Persian accent. At this point I was no longer horny or depressed. She responded with ‚Äúwhere is who?‚Äù. Fuckin botched it. Her dog (who barked at anything and everything) walked into the room and looked under the bed. Somehow he spared my life and turned the other cheek. Her dad slowly walked over to the door that led from her room to their backyard, looked out the window and muttered something under his breath. He walked out of her room and I immediately popped out from under the bed and threw on my pants and shirt. Ran the 5 miles home in the rain half of which was thru the woods. Got bit on my neck by a banana spider, chased by a German Shepard cutting thru someone‚Äôs back yard and ruined my phone and iPod. Wild times",

I had met her just before she went overseas for school and we had been talking the whole six months she was gone. She came back around Christmas and we started ‚Äúdating‚Äù officially, ie. i paid for everything and she would play it coy and withhold sex like a dangling carrot. I only wised up to her when we were at a Valentines Day dinner at a place near her parents house where she lived and a couple guys came in that she knew. She was drunk and waved them down and they came to sit with us, and she proceeded to hang all over one of the guys while I sat there confused and fuming. When she got up to stumble to the bathroom, the guy told me straight up, ‚ÄúThis may sound like a silly question, but are you two on a date?‚Äù \n\nI answered yes through gritted teeth and he said, ‚ÄúTake it from me, she won‚Äôt have sex with you. And even if she does it won‚Äôt be worth it. She will play you like a piano and have you pay for everything until you get up and leave.‚Äù \n\nShe came back, they bid farewell, and she asked for me to take her home. I dropped her off and drive myself home. The next day when I confronted her about it over the phone I could feel her shrugging on the other end of the line, ‚Äúyou should probably listen to them.‚Äù Broke it off right there. I‚Äôm probably casting her more harshly than she deserves, but I felt pretty damn used by the end of it.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure how much I actually liked her - she was funny and sarcastic but spoiled as all hell and a total elitist - I was just so attracted to her that I couldn‚Äôt think straight.

Well, couple weeks later go to a music festival with a friend and guess who else showed up. We ended up fucking in the tent that night. She quit using meth because I said I wouldn't be with a tweaker. Stayed together for a few years after that.\n\nOr there was the one that I started talking to online because we had mutual friends. Well, she was in fucking WACO at the time chilling with the remaining members of the branch davidians. We hooked up immediately after she got back in town. She tried convincing me to go back with her. But the only way they would allow it is if we were married. So she went and printed off a marriage license.

She used to be a model though and I was young so‚Ä¶\n\nWe went to a going away party for one of my female coworkers who was just a friend. As the night went on my gf got more belligerent until she told me I should ‚Äújust go ahead and screw my coworker in the bathroom‚Äù. At that point I politely excused us from the evening and drove my gf home. \n\nOn the way back she was over the moon drunk and angry screaming at me in a jealous rage. I was not engaging as I was the DD and sober. At one point she hit me in the chest while I was driving and I immediately pulled the car over to tell her that was not cool. As soon as I pulled over, lights and sirens. \n\nI pulled into an empty parking lot and the police officer had me get out of the car to explain why I was swerving erratically. After proving I was sober and explaining what happened, he interviewed my gf who thankfully corroborated my story. \n\nThey then informed me that they had to arrest my gf for abuse. That‚Äôs when I lost my cool. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt call you guys, you pulled me over. I told you my story only to prove I was not drunk. I did not say I wanted to press charges or ask for your help. If you are arresting her based on what I said, then fine it was all a lie.‚Äù\n\nAfter like 20 minutes of deliberation, they decided to let us go. I get in the car and the first thing she says is ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt find me a bathroom NOW, I am going to pee in you car.‚Äù\n\nNeedless to say, I broke up with her. But the kicker is months later, long after we broke up, I received a package in the mail from the police department. It contained materials about how to know when you are in an abusive relationship and methods for dealing with or escaping them.  And now I am a registered victim of domestic abuse in my county.",

We were at a townie dive bar where we met these girls - one hot, one not. They were both in their upper 30s. We talked for a while, and my buddy wanted to go back to their place. I was not interested thinking the hot one was interested in him. He tells me later that she wanted me, so my interest was piqued again. \n\nFast forward a couple hours and my buddy is driving the four of us in her full-sized conversion van that looks like Uncle Rico's (because she was too drunk) back to her small house. As soon as we walked in the door, the first thing we saw was a literal hospital bed with an IV and other machines attached to it. There are multiple lamps on tables, but none of them has a lampshade, which I thought was odd. She tells me her youngest kid has multiple health issues, but he's at her ex-husband's house that night. Her older son and her nephew are there drinking. The older son gets pissed that his mom brought another guy home apparently and leaves for the father's house. \n\nI'm thinking I should leave then believing the ex will come back to kick my ass. But she convinced me to stay. Her brand new double D implants made a compelling argument. We drink there for a while before my buddy heads down to the basement with the other girl. My girl starts making out with me on the couch in the living room. It was one of those giant L couches. Normally, this would have been golden except her nephew was sleeping on one arm of the L. We make out for a bit on the other arm, and I ask her if she wants to go to her bedroom. She tells me her kids have the bedrooms in the house, so she sleeps on the couch. Probably should have left at that point as well. But definitely not thinking about much else at this point. \n\nSo we end up going at it on the other end of the L couch. I remember going down on her for a bit. As I looked up at her eyes at one point, behind her head I see the nephew awake and staring at me. He didn't say or do anything just laying there staring at me. Needless to say, my arousal was going down quickly. Fortunately, she didn't want to go all the way that night, so after we finished what we were doing, we fell asleep on the couch. Her nephew's big clown feet kicked me in the head a couple times throughout the couple hours of restless sleep before my buddy creeps into the room and says we need to leave. My car is still downtown, but luckily, this girl's house was about 3 blocks from my parents, so we walked home around 5 am. Said a quick goodbye and left . Never saw her again, but that was a fun night.",

I was surprised that she had a yacht as she was only maybe 18 (I was 16 maybe 17) and the place she was staying at was pretty rough, but who knew maybe she was slumming it and had rich parents. I didn't really care, I was young and horny and she was hot.\n\n On the way there, she told me how awesome she thought heroin was which did give me brief pause for thought, about 30 seconds, and then I let the little head take over again. \nWe got to a beach and there was a dinghy, I rowed us out to a fairly humble little yacht. We went inside and immediately started getting busy, it was awesome and all the weirdness was worth it until- the actual owner of the yacht came crashing aboard, not well pleased. It turned out this guy was the girls ex, and he was pissed off to say the least. He was at least 25 and bigger than me, it was damn scary in the confines of a very small boat. I managed to get out of the cabin and onto the deck, fending the guy off as he continued to shout at me, and just jumped overboard and swam...my shirt and hat were still on the boat but at least I had my pants on. The girl stayed on board, she had rather halfheartedly tried to calm the guy down but hadn't seemed very surprised, or tried very hard to intervene. For all I know it was all just mind games for this other guy! Never saw her again, and always regretted that we got interrupted when we did, but also glad that i got away with everything intact except my dignity",

She tells me she‚Äôs be ‚Äúaway‚Äù as was just now getting herself re-established.‚Äù\n\nToward the end of the night, my ride came to get me. I mentioned we should exchange numbers but instead she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give it to you tomorrow morning when you leave.‚Äù Game, set, match‚Ä¶or so I thought. \n\nWe drive back to her place and start making out on the couch, I notice her apartment is sparse, very sparse, but it‚Äôs not quite the time to ask. As things get heavier we make our way to her bedroom, where there‚Äôs a comforter on the floor, a few pillows and not much else. Clothes start coming off but before I‚Äôm naked, she is on top of me grinding violently, I mean she was determined to start a fire in her crotch. After about 10 minutes, she rolls off me and says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs been a while, my nut left me weak, you mind jumping on top?‚Äù I finally get naked, get a shield on and go to town. The sex is good, not great but we both had fun. \n\nAfter we‚Äôve both cleaned up we‚Äôre laying in‚Ä¶floor, and I ask if she‚Äôs just moved in. She told me she had only been ‚Äúout‚Äù a week and was getting herself situated. I was naturally curious and began to ask questions. That‚Äôs when she hit me, she told me she was in prison for a few years for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. She has gotten into a fight with a girl and stabbed her a few times. At this point it‚Äôs late, I have no car or cash (this was way before Uber) and really don‚Äôt have a way to exit this situation in a way that wouldn‚Äôt anger a known stabber. I had to play it cool. We fall asleep, but I didn‚Äôt sleep much.\n\nThe next morning, she shows me her prison release papers and packages, including a clear back TV, sort of like the old iMacs but crystal clear, so inmates can‚Äôt hide contraband. I tell her I‚Äôve got to get going and call the previous night‚Äôs original ride to come grab me. He shows up, I say good bye and I‚Äôm out. Many years later she sends me a message on social media, she asks if I remember her and I say, ‚Äúhow could I forget.‚Äù She tells me she‚Äôs got oxy for sale and we should hang sometime, I didn‚Äôt respond.",

Called me at like 2am for an unexpected ride home because she was super drunk. So I drove there in my pajama pants and picked up her and her friends. Drove her friends home first. The whole trip they were talking me up and how she should finally f*** me. \n\nSo now its just me and her and I'm driving her home. She tells me to pull into some empty warehouse parking lot. Once I park, we start making out and she's giving the lil feller some attention. Finally she starts pulling down her pants in the passenger seat. Keep in mind this is in January and is freezing out, so windows are up. As soon as she pulled her panties down, my car was IMMEDIATELY filled with the worst ass vagina smell I've ever smelled. I tried cracking the windows cause I didn't want to say anything. No luck, it was getting worse. Having trouble keeping an erection it smelled so bad.  I tried every excuse to stop, told her I didn't have a rubber. She said just pull out and squirt on me. I had an older Mustang, so I tried to say there wasn't enough room. She countered with just bend me over the hood. FML. So there I am bending her over the hood then tried flipping her butt down hoping mother nature would help. No luck. No wind, not so much as a mosquito flying by to help me out. I eventually told her I couldn't keep it up because I was too nervous that we were in public.

As things are building she disclosed the guns are her husbands and he works in another state which is why she‚Äôs so lonely. We were half undressed at the time. Then her 3 year old daughter walks in the room. Scares the shit out of me. I barrel roll onto the floor from the bed. My heart was palpitating. She puts her back to sleep and comes back in. I went ahead and finished up the deed and only went back about 4 or 5 more times as the thought of her gun wielding husband showing up was a real turnoff.",

While at one of these shows, we get to chatting with some Russian students studying English who work there, and I hit it off with this one girl. \n\nWell, we're talking back and forth while I'm there, meeting for meals and walks, she's showing me around the local spots. We're at this bar underground one night and end up making out, had some fun in the bathroom, and she invites me to her place the next night to really go at it. \n\nI meet her at the metro station that next night, make out a bit, and head over to her place. We get to this big bombed out looking building. I'm talking we step inside and there's no lights, the stairs are crumbling and busted up, just big red flags on sight. I haven't told anyone where I am, in a foreign country where I barely know how to say hello, and I'm with this girl I've only known for a week or two. \n\nSix flights of busted Soviet Era stairs later she stops in front of this door with peeling paint and no indication of habitation at all. She tells me I have to be very quiet, there's other people here. Still went in.\n\nCraziest part? She opens the door and it's a regular apartment.

            "text": "I was 19 and recently single.  I got on tinder for some female attention.  I talked to a couple people, but nothing really came of it.  I matched with a girl from my university that, at the time, I thought was cute.  \n\nShe was very forward‚Ä¶ like, very, very forward.  She would say whatever she was thinking and had no shame.  She was super catholic and devoted to waiting until marriage to have sex.  But, she said she‚Äôs down to do absolutely any else either then penis-in-vagina penetration.  So, I was ready.\n\nWe were in her dorm room (she somehow got lucky and didn‚Äôt have a roommate), and we were cuddling watching Netflix.  She goes ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sound like a slut‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. But can you finger me?‚Äù  I was like shit okay, this is my time.  So I did.  Super wet.  Ate her out, the usual.  I was a little nervous because it was the first person I had been with since my break up, and I‚Äôm just an anxious person in general, but THEN she went down on me.  She loved giving blowjobs, and damn it was great.  I usually can‚Äôt get off from blowjobs, but she was determined.  48 minutes later, somehow her jaw wasn‚Äôt locked, and she took my load in the mouth.  I‚Äôd also like to add that, at least four times, she would randomly stop sucking my dick and hold it and pretend it was a microphone and she was a baseball announcer.\n\nShe still was very forward, wanted to meet my parents, and I knew she was crazy.  But, she gave good head and she liked me.  I was also a horny little teen thinking I could convince her to give up her v card. \n\nAnother time, she was telling me how she likes it really rough.  She wanted to feel a physical pain, much more than just spanking.  She wanted me to choke her while I was eating her out, so I was reaching as far as I could.  She said she wanted to be choked so hard until she almost passed out.  She called me daddy a couple times (my first time), and it was alright with me, but then she called me papi (she is very white, I am Japanese), and I was so uncomfortable. \n\nAnyway, six days after we matched on tinder she told me she loved me.  She also told me she was still in love with her ex, and she talked about him ALL the time.  I told her I couldn‚Äôt say I loved her, and I felt like we couldn‚Äôt have a relationship since she was so in love with her ex.  She started violently punching herself in the head and the face because she ‚Äúwas so stupid and messes everything up.‚Äù  I awkwardly left her dorm room and went home.  The next day, I asked for my hoodie back (it was my favorite hoodie). She set up a day and time where she could sit me down, talk with me, have me read 8 pages from her journal about how horrible her life is and how everything goes wrong‚Ä¶ I read through that as she stated at me with tears in her eyes the whole time.  I finished the reading, and she, still staring, goes ‚Äúwell..?‚Äù  I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I hurt you.  That sounds tough.  Can I please have my hoodie back?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo, you need to say more.‚Äù  So I said some bullshit about how I want the best for her, yada yada yada.  I got my hoodie back and went home.  A couple weeks later, she commented that I looked cute on one of my Instagram posts.  I deleted it because I didn‚Äôt want it on there.  She went off on me and blocked me on everything.  She now teaches at the small catholic high school she went to and cut her wrists in.  Haven‚Äôt spoken with her since then though. \n\nAt the time, it really sucked, and I was frustrated and annoyed.  But looking back, it was such a short period of my life, and the head was really good.",

She was 18, and by then I was at the point that I never wanted to date that young again...but she was ridiculously hot and I agreed to give it a try. \n\nWe hit it off well. She was actually very sweet but that first night she already proved to be a little \"out there,\" as she brought up crystals and angels pretty quickly. I tried not to think much of it and just keep my eye on the prize. We exchanged numbers at the end of the night. \n\nWe ended up hanging out a bunch and going on a couple dates over the next few weeks. I was legitimately enjoying her company but every time she brought up the weird spiritual talk, I would just play along to keep things smooth. The one night, we were headed back to her apartment while her dad was gone. As i was driving, she dropped the biggest bomb yet: She told me she believed she was the reincarnation of an angel and that she was sent to earth to spread love and light. I just nodded slowly and kept my eyes on the road. She was 1000% serious. She asked if I thought she was crazy and that if I was going to leave her now just like everyone else. By then, I was desperate enough to get laid so I played along as best I could. She was at least happy enough that I decided to not ghost her afterwards. \n\nI didn't even end up getting laid though. I tried, but she ended up having some reservations about sexual activity because she lost her virginity at 15 and wanted to wait until marriage after that. And then she got deeply offended at an innocuous joke I made about her period and she never wanted to talk to me again. I think she probably experienced some other trauma, possibly from her dad, that lead to her being so bizarre. I honestly felt bad for her because she was a very sweet girl, but FUCK was that a strange experience.",

            "text": "Hey, I‚Äôve got one for this.  In college I started flirting with a girl in one of my classes.  We hung out a few times but it never went anywhere.  She called me to hang out on my birthday, but I was already at a club and another girl was showing some major interest, so I told her the club wasn‚Äôt happening but we could hang out the next night.\n\nI call her the next night and she says that since I didn‚Äôt want to hang out with her the night before, she drove to Dallas and got back with her ex.  NOT a short drive.  Uh, ok.  \n\nThe NEXT night she calls me and says she‚Äôs back in town and wants to take me out to eat and explain herself.  Ooookkkk, this should be good.  She picks me up at my place & we go eat.  We start eating, and she‚Äôs rambling.  Definitely on some form of chemical recreation.  Halfway through the meal she out-of-the-blue tells me she wants to sleep with me that night.  I nearly spit out my tea.  Then she claims she just meant cuddling.  Ok, whatever.  Next, she wants to dine & dash despite the fact that we‚Äôre literally sitting next to a table full of cops.  At my insistence, she finally pays.\n\nStill thinking with my southern head, she says we will go to my place after she drops her mom‚Äôs car off.  Ride with her to her parents‚Äô giant house next to the country club.  We get there and she says she has changed her mind about going to my place, but to come inside for a bit and then she‚Äôll take me home.  Dammit, ok, I don‚Äôt have much choice.\n\nSo I go inside.  Meet her mom, who is friendly and totally nonplussed by my presence, her daughter‚Äôs behavior, or the fact that her daughter is high as shit.  Then go upstairs and meet her dad, who is VERY plussed by my presence, but she and I are both adults and I‚Äôm WAY bigger than him, so he can‚Äôt do much.  Meanwhile, she goes in the bathroom for what felt like forever, comes out, and goes into her room for a bit (right across the hall from the room where her dad and I are very awkwardly watching football).  Then she summons me to her room.\n\nAs soon as I enter, she lies down on the bed and says ‚ÄúLock the door and turn out the light.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGirl, are you freaking SERIOUS?  You told me you got back with your ex yesterday.  You‚Äôre obviously on something.  Your mom, who I just met, is downstairs.  Your dad, who is not happy I‚Äôm here, is literally across the hall.  And you wanna do this right here, right now?!?!?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNone of that stuff matters.  Come here.‚Äù\n\nSoooo I did.  I didn‚Äôt get stabbed, shot, or beaten up.  Instead, I just dished out some fairly disappointing sex because we had to be quiet and I was so nervous.  Then I waited for what felt like another eternity for her parents to go to bed so she could take me home.  My roommates were afraid she‚Äôd murdered me since I never came home.  No murder, just a weird, WEIRD night‚Ä¶but I did get laid!",

Nice guy though and I was more bothered as to why she‚Äôd assume I was homophobic. Second thing was that she had a photo of a really nasty looking bastard on her fridge. Turns out it was her ex, and he was homophobic, so that explained her question. Then I hear a key going and it turns out her ‚Äúex‚Äù wasn‚Äôt really her ex and the aforementioned nasty bastard let‚Äôs himself in, glares at me and snarls ‚Äúwho the fuck‚Äôs this cunt?‚Äù. To this day I don‚Äôt know how I did it so quick but I quickly said, in a really camp voice, ‚Äúoh hiiiiii, I‚Äôm (gay hairdressers name) boyfriend‚Äù and I could see gay hairdresser‚Äôs jaw drop behind nasty bastard as he stared at me. Spent the next half hour or so commenting on her curtains and shoes and doing as much gay stuff that I‚Äôd seen gay characters on TV do as I could. She was finally ready and said she was ready to go out for dinner with me and hairdresser - nasty was still suspicious so I invited him to come out with us as it would be soooooo much fun. He declined, well more like grunted ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù. Us three left the house, and she hopped out of gay guys car and into mine down the road. Crazy good sex later, I dropped her off at the top of her road at her insistence. \n\nShe phones me the next day and says she decided to go straight to her car and drive to her mums to avoid him, but his nasty instincts were one step ahead of her and he‚Äôd been waiting in the back seat of her car for her to do this. He beat her up a bit and she confessed I wasn‚Äôt gay and told him what had happened, and he was going to kill me when he saw me again. She ended with ‚Äú‚Ä¶but I really want to see you again‚Äù. I said uh yeah, I‚Äôll call you later and never did.\n\nAs a final update I went out with the lads a year or so later in that town and one of the bouncers on the door of a club looked at me and asked ‚Äúdo I know you?‚Äù - it was nasty bastard but he couldn‚Äôt place me. I mumbled something about yes I was in last week so he probably recognised me from then, and so I never went back to that club again either.",

Anyways I met this chick in the store one time, she seemed to be having a hard time navigating through the paper or reading it? I don‚Äôt know. I was young and she was cute as hell and she had this crooked half smile that melted me instantly. We were talking and she was all about Nintendo and Gameboy and gamegear. We spoke for a while in the store and then shared numbers. First place we met was at an abandoned bus station? Her choice‚Ä¶ I was nervous and scared but I wanted it. Met up and she had laid this fur like rug over some trash bags and we went in for three rounds. Afterwards I left, come to find out she stole my damn debit card, but she didn‚Äôt use it like crazy, she used it to buy herself food. I confronted her and we had sex again in the movies. Then I found out she was homeless and I invited her to my apartment that I shared with my brother for a few days‚Ä¶ bad idea‚Ä¶. Oh man this girl went into the fridge and I mean ATE EVERYTHING and she was a skinny ass little petite looking thing with an infinite hungry hole in her stomach. She even went to town on the food in the cupboards. She even ate random shit like jalape√±o peppers in the jar and already opened jar of Ragu tomatoe sauce and other random shit. Holy shit my brother lost his shit. Demanded she leave, when she left we found out she had stole not just my card but his card as well and made purchases for girly things like tampons and other stuff, a hair brush and food and some underwear and a coat. My brother was so pissed at me calling me a fool. I callled her (secretly) and got to meet up with her again. She gave me both cards back (but my brother had already shut them down) had sex in a train station bathroom and never saw her again.\n\n Completely worth I don‚Äôt care.

I went to her house and she had me sit in a specific spot in the living room. Then she starting acting out sexy moves and slowly undressing. I did notice that she was posing and figured we were on video. I didn't care as much as I thought I would. She was (is) very tall and and had most of her gorgeous body tattooed. I never knew this. In the bedroom she had all the positions planned. Still didn't care. Afterwards I said I would never do that again and felt a bit gross. Cut to the next weekend at my house where now I'm recording us on her cell phone so she can show him later. A couple times she even didnt clean herself afterwards and just quickly went home...messy. Some bizarre role play worked its way in later. We did this numerous times until I started dating someone seriously and it was like no big deal.\nThe kicker...come to find out her husband is much older and a well known former baseball player.",

The night of, she calls me hours earlier than anticipated and wants to meet up. At the time I think nothing of it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just giddy about the potential because she‚Äôs an absolute objective dime. Like I cannot properly emphasize how insanely hot she appeared to be‚Ä¶ she looked like a younger Margot Robbie with bigger tits. In fact, my ex was over at the time and I kick her out and told her I had a work thing come up that should only be a few hours‚Ä¶ very shitty.\n\nWell I talk to the girl on the phone and she sounds normal enough - doesn‚Äôt know the city and doesn‚Äôt really want to go anywhere so we agree to meet at my condo. A little weird but honestly what I would want anyway. Well she shows up and is herself - she‚Äôs not catfishing me‚Ä¶ but she‚Äôs with her 16 year old brother and she‚Äôs shitfaced‚Ä¶ faked it insanely well on the phone and even in walking up my stairs but overall an absolute fucking space cadet. Eventually she settles down - we all collectively  chat for awhile at my condo - mostly me talking to her brother. Obviously not the romance I was expecting. I‚Äôm ready to just call it a weird night and be done so I offer to help the girl get to her car. \n\nWe all head out but they both spontaneously are in desperate need of cigarettes and ask me for a store which I don‚Äôt fucking know because I‚Äôm a nerd who has never smoked a cig in my life. We get to a convenience store. But wait another surprise‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs says she too young to buy cigarettes herself. She initially claimed to be 24 but was 20 and the wheels are spinning in my head why she‚Äôs even hanging out this early in the first place (either got turned away at the door or quickly kicked out of the concert).\n\nFinally walk them back to their car, say seeya, and the girl then grabs me and goes full French makeout‚Ä¶ right in front of her fucking brother. Kids just watching‚Ä¶ and honestly I‚Äôm closer with him at this point in the night lmao. But overall I‚Äôm so caught off guard with shit that I‚Äôm just a her kiss test dummy‚Ä¶ sitting there calculating whether that‚Äôs legal, what‚Äôs wrong with this girl, whether or not her brother is risking a DUI going home, and still a small part of me thinking: ‚Äúthis girl, while a nutcase, is so goddamn attractive‚Äù.\n\nWell a few week later I invite her to fly out to meet me on a business trip. She agrees and I buy her a flight. She texts me the following day and has to cancel - she was also drunk when she said yes. \n\nSo technically never got laid but I think woke this girl up to her drinking problem and can now reconcile I would have overlooked just about anything to try",

Secondly, if I'd actually felt the icy cold grip of the deceased pushing me into a jackhammer, I'd go limper than a fucking blobfish. It was a lackluster finish, and she started crying afterwards, which I was both too drunk *and* too sober for. Saw her a couple more times at some parties, but neither of us had the guts to acknowledge the other. Honestly, makes me really sad thinking back on it, because she was obviously a total wreck from losing her fiance, but at the time I just thought she was a creepy, albeit cute, pervert.\n\nGlad I've moved away from that dick-wet-at-all-costs lifestyle, it was a bad place for me",
