    "Straight men of Reddit, what are questions you‚Äôve always had for gay men, but been too afraid to ask?\nHello, it‚Äôs your friendly neighborhood gay man. I‚Äôve noticed over the years a lot of men just haven‚Äôt had the chance to ask the questions they might have about what it‚Äôs like being a gay man. They either don‚Äôt know someone in their life who is gay they can ask, or are afraid to ask because they don‚Äôt want to be judged by others. So, with nothing off limits, what questions do you have?": [

Especially in the most recent years, we have seen (at least here in Europe) an increasing effort in specifying the correct terminology, in order to be as inclusive as possible and not make people from minorities feel wrong. In this context, it makes zero sense to me that heterosexual people are called \"straight\", as if all others are inherently not straight, which may imply there's something wrong with them. As a heterosexual man, this bugs me and makes me think that if I were gay, it would aggravate me even more.\n\nHow do you feel about it?",

Does this check out or is this a bi-curious situation?\n\nSecondly, I am a Christian and an ally. I've seen many gay men who also believed in God or have Conservative families struggle with this. I disagree with most churches and politicized Christianity. As a gay man, are the majority of gay or part of the community people religious or do they feel shunned, therefore becoming agnostic or atheist?\n\nAnd finally, I lost a family member to AIDS when I was young. Have you lost anyone to that or violence? I have a ton of regret bc I don't feel said family member was supported by our family, even on his death bed in the hospital. They loved him completely, but would never discuss his being gay. As an adult, looking back, I feel horrible that I wasn't more of a comfort to him in his last days and often pray he felt love and peace at the end. How do, if you have had to, come to terms with such an unnecessary loss?

            "text": "Hey there! Thanks a lot for making this thread.\n\nI find that I sometimes get hit on or approached by gay men, which is flattering. However, I am wondering why this tends to to happen to me?  \nThis first time this happened, after clearing up the misunderstanding, I asked my new gay friend if he thought I seemed gay. He said no, he couldn't tell if I was gay or just a nice guy. Have you met other straight guys like this?  \nI also asked a close female friend (who claims she has an excellent gaydar) if she thought I seemed gay, and she said no. She did say it was amazing that I was attractive to both men and women, which I took as a compliment! lol\n\nAlso, this has happened more than once where I think it's me and another straight dude hanging out, but he's actually gay and thinks that we might be on a date. I'm pretty dense, so maybe he's dropping signals that I'm not catching. The first time this happened, he invited me back to his place (I assumed to hang out?), and then he sat close to me and stroked my hair. I was freaked out lol. Before that happened, I thought have might have been gay but wasn't sure, and I didn't want to make any assumptions. I didn't just want to blurt out \"are you gay?\", unprompted. But, I also don't want to unintionally lead someone on.  \nMy question is, what should I do in these situations? Thank you!!\n\nP.S. This has really blown up, so I imagine you must be really busy! I won't take any offence at all if you're not able to make it to my questions, haha.",
