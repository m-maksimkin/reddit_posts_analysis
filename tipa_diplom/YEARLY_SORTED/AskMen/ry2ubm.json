    "What is something you thought all men do, but turns out they don’t?\nTeenage me thought all dudes could suck themselves off. One horny night as a teenager I decided I was going to try, and it was about an inch from my mouth. So I stretched every night and finally got a bit of it in. \n\nFast forward 6 years later and I’m hanging with a big group of guys and the topic of sucking yourself came up and we all admitted to attempting. And I realized none of them had said they had actually succeeded. I asked them if any one had actually done it and literally none of them had. And at that point they realized I had and clowned me so hard for it.\n\nSo, what did you think was normal for guys but turned out it wasn’t?\n\nEdit some of my findings from the answers: \n- everyone wants you to wash your ass dude, and if you already do, good on you \n-a lot of you have sucked your own dick\n- a lot more of you have attempted\n- 3 dudes have dreams about sucking themselves\n- lots of people thought all men wished they were girls, so to the ones that did: thank you for bringing the population up and giving me a bigger shot at finding a woman\n- poo knife\n- there’s a guy that catches his own shit and then drops it in the toilet? Like what\n- some people men think wiping is gay? Like sir wait till I tell you about what you have to hold while pissing\n-also to the dude who not only drank his own urine, but also assumed everyone else did: good on you I guess?\n\nEdit 2, some thank you’s are in order\n- to whoever sent redditcare on me, you’re probably right I do need help \n- to whoever encouraged me in my dms about being able to suck myself off into my 30’s like you do, I’ll pass, once was enough": [

I simply use my hands to rub everything else with hot water, even the nethers. Despite this, no woman has ever said I smelled bad and a few have said I smelled good. I do wear deodorant.\n* I rarely clean below my thighs in the shower. Despite this, I have no weird rashes, growths, or abnormalities when directly compared to other people.\n* I stopped wearing underwear when I was 9 and never looked back. Only three times in my life has this created an issue.  Twice when I tore the ass out of my pants at work at 17 and 19.  Once when I walked into a Burger King at 23 and didn't know my zipper was wide open (the cashier was staring at me as I sauntered up and didn't know why until I left).\n* I clean my ass with baby wipes *every* time and am curious about using bidets, but don't want to make the investment without at least trying it somewhere first.\n* When I look in the mirror, I see a pretty idealized version of myself.

I mean, it should be objectively obvious to any modern western man who is awake and paying attention at all, right? \n\nLjke, it just feels, i dunno, rational? that, for example, men's fashion should include skirts and dresses (for anatomical reasons), bodysuits (because men very often tuck their shirts in), purses (because a man should always be prepared with like tools or whatever), makeup (because men can have bad skin too), high heels (because a man's height is kind of a big deal in our culture), and so on... \n\nThen, last year, i started hanging out in more lgbt+ spaces, and i learned that many trans men love men's fashion. Like, even the things that always seemed \"objectively terrible\" to me, i would see a trans man posting a photo of themselves being like \"this is what gender euphoria looks like\" and I'm like wtf it's literally just like dad sandals and cargo shorts, who would *want* that? \n\nAs it turns out, the mistake I've been making most of my life, is that i may be less cis-man than i always thought i was...",
