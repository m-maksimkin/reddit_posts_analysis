One milf in particular was super flirty and talky every break we take. Close up the night with dance song and she dances alone in front of my drum kit. No shit, is touching places that make me lose my count. Didn’t even tear down drums(usually haul home night of). Drags me into elevator and proceeds to pull up her dress and guide my fingers inside the wettest nest I’ve ever experienced!! Totally crazy night of insane sex. She smelled snd tasted so good! I’ll never forget. No number no correspondence. Must have been married. If that dude didn’t service that beautiful woman nightly he is failing. \n\n#2 same scenario but opens for major tour band. On dance floor jiving to said band and sexy 25 ish girl grabs me from behind and starts man-jammin her pointy boaty boy into my ass. I grind back for the moment. Tried to turn around to see what I was being molested by and I was stunned by her beauty. Immediately she spins me back around and again starts gyrating her lady boner on me! I push back and it’s really got my custard chucker payin attention. All of the sudden im looking at the ceiling and she has my long ponytail wrapped in her hand  and the other hand has me bent over like a pony in a buckin contest! Runnin me around the dance floor. Took that philly home and had the once in a lifetime all-nighter with a woman who love to fuck. Actually kept in contact till she moved away. Most dependable booty fall I’ve ever had. And I was 10 years older. Me 35 her 25! Once in a lifetime…. Or twice!",

I have a hotel room nearby, you wanna come over and fuck me?” The lady bartender hears her and gives me a shocking look. Obviously I’m on the spot and everyone is awaiting my answer.

To be honest she was one of the most pretty women I've ever seen and it must have been a joke. She had a face like zooey deschanel and a body like Nicki Minaj. Men have told her that she's intimidating to approach because of her beauty and I agreed. So I think finally after a few more days she became really frustrated with me, thought of it as a wash and just walked up to me and started humping me in front of all of my coworkers. Everyone laughed including me cuz it was done in a funny way expressing her frustration. I still didn't do anything because it was no way I was going to get with someone that much out of my league.

Incredible cute blonde girl struts in, sits in the desk Infront of me, spins around dramatically and asks me-\n\n\"Do you like musicals?\"\n\n\"Yeah sure.\"\n\n\"What's your favorite?\"\n\n\"Maybe Sweeney Todd?\"\n\n\"Cool\" - she then proceeds to get up and leave. \n\nLet me tell y'all something. This witch like, implanted something in me, cause I couldn't figure her out and I didn't stop thinking about her. Then whenever she'd pass me in the hall she'd wink or wave or come talk to me until eventually we exchanged info-\n\nFull disclosure. I was already in a relationship, but I ended up leaving that girl to date her. I also happened to be friends with her best friend (who also had a crush on me and was mad when we started dating) \"you stole him from under me\" \n\nThe three of us ended up almost being polyamorous after a group hookup. \n\nOn a raunchier note, I on the more than one occasion have had a girl come up to me and basically just tell me they want to hook up. We then proceeded to hook up. \n\nOne time a girl a texted me out of the blue- \n\n\"I got this number from **** (girl I hooked up with) come to the bathroom in the south building\" (we went to a very large high school) \n\nSo me, being the reckless horny teenager was like, aight. No idea what she looked like or who she was. She was cute. We fucked in the back stall of the boys bathroom.",

Hit them on the head with a chair\n4. Grabbing their junk under the table without asking\n5. Basically force them to look up their skirt\n6. Showing a co worker a picture of their vagina without consent/asking\n7. Dropping their pants in front of a man without warning or asking so he “can look at her wax” (currently the very top comment)\n8. Driving by a man *while hes at work* and catcalling/yelling at him “you give me a huge ladyboner!”\n\nOh and that’s just within the first 30 minutes this thread existed and just a few of many i happened to add. \n\nFunny….for women this is all seen as merely “aggressive”. If men did any of these (other than maybe 8, although in that example we would definitely get fired if we also worked there) we would be in jail or at the very least had the cops called on us, double standards are real.\n\nI’ve said it before and i’ll say it again, women have just as much an issue respecting consent as men do, we just dont seem to punish them or call them out as much. Women, you need to do better, and men, we need to call this out more. I know a lot of times it boosts our confidence, I get it and I’ve felt the same way, but really this is not right, there is no consent in any of this.",

            "text": "About a month ago, a voluptuous, pretty young lady came and sat with my friends and I as we were at a low key, outdoor bar.  It was a colder night, so we were pretty much the only ones outside.  We’re smoking cigars as it’s a bit of a celebratory night, and she has a cigarette, so she asks to join our smoking circle. Sure, cool, no problem. \n\nShe’s pretty drunk. We’re chatting for about 10, maybe 15 minutes, but if feels longer, and her answers to things aren’t quite non sequitur, but they’re not good.  You know these responses:\n\n“I work in finance. What about you?”\n\n“I’m in like, real estate.  It’s just been crazy because, like…. Crazy.  Just lots of market growth and I think it should… yeah. Crazy. Right? Does that make sense? Crazy.  Sorry if it sounds weird.”\n\nLike having a conversation with a senile dog who learned how to speak.\n\nAgain, we’ve been toddler talking for like 15 minutes. My friends have slowly evaporated from the table to go exist anywhere else, but I’ve been at the corner seat, locked in with this girl speaking to me while she presses her elbows together and learns forward.  She’s hot, but I want to have real conversations with my friends; I’m just too polite to all out bail on her.  \n\nThe night is kinda drawing to a close. I’m hoping the boys say “hey Shark (they don’t call me that, but  it’s a nickname from lots of other people— you’re not getting my real name, Reddit) let’s get outta here.”\n\nShe then says “it’s kinda cold-“\n\nFUCK.  She’s correct and not wearing a jacket.  I’ve held off offering mine because I don’t want to be responsible for her physical well being and then feel shitty when asking for my jacket.  Also, offering at any other point would have directly glued me into conversing with her while my friends and I all played this reverse version of rodeo poker.  I lost anyway, but offering at an earlier point would have immediately conceded defeat.  If she asks, as a Texan gentleman, I’d be obliged to offer my jacket.  Not just offer, but insist she wear it.\n\nShe doesn’t mention the jacket.\n\n“It’s kinda cold, so I think I’m going to head back to my hotel room.  Do you want to warm me up in there?”\n\nThe heads of my four friends slowly turn in unison to our direction.  They didn’t see it coming.  Neither did I.  Like a fastball when you’re expecting the change up: all you can do is look it in and try to hide your own befuddled astonishment.\n\n“Ummm… Thank you.”\n\nI said that.  A real, straight dude with a functioning dick, and that was my shot from the hip during this midnight duel.\n\n“To be honest, you seem pretty drunk, so I don’t think it would be cool of me in this situation, and plus, that husband you mentioned earlier probably wouldn’t appreciate it very much.”  I also have to be up early to watch the last race of the season, and I have a feeling she’s going to impede that in every imaginable fashion.\n\nShe says,” Oh yeah, we’re kinda going through a separation.  I think you would be fun to hangout with alone.  I’m fun alone.”\n\nHer speech has improved during this proposition.  I pull the last polite card I have.  “I bet you are.  But I also have a girlfriend, and I don’t think she’d be cool with it, so I don’t think I should go up with you.”\n\nI thought I was playing respectable, professional level ball when she put me in my dumb, “you’re never gonna make it, ya fucking hack,” amateur place.\n\n“Oh, you have a girlfriend?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Well she can come, too.”\n\nPanic. Arousal. Arousal. Panic.  \n\nThe city around us has slowed.  This metropolis is now silent, perfectly aligned with with the vast expanse beyond the stars.  A breath suddenly feels dangerous to take, as if I might inhale the universe.\n\nI look at my friends.  They’re spectating this cosmic event for the low, low price of free.  Part astonishment, part wonder.  Lots of cautious curiosity like “the neighbors are getting ghetto in the backyard, come watch.”\n\nThat jolts me back.  “Oh, well I think that maybe, yeah. Like, it’s getting late and… you know?”  I’m stammering.  Am I a senile dog?\n\nOne of my friends pulls ripcord on the back up parachute and says “bout time we hit the road, yeah, Shark?”\n\n“Yup.  It was nice talking to you. I’ve got to get going, hope you have a good night.”\n\nBut she’s come too far.  It can’t end there. She’s cold, after all.\n\n“You said you live pretty close?”\n\n“Uh, yeah, I did.”\n\n“You think there’s room for me in that bed?”\n\nI’m midway through chugging my drink when I realize how wrong I was.  I was never in danger of inhaling the universe.  It was actively trying to inhale me, disguised as a 34 EE cup.  I’ve been out dueled.  Had. Nearly ridiculed on the stage of casual sex and would be three-ways.\n\nPut the drink down and say “thanks, but I’ve got to catch up to my friends. Have a goodnight!”\n\nWalk home. Divulge details to my friends along the way.  One says “I’ve never seen anyone strike out at T-ball.”  Another says “she would have served your dick breakfast, lunch, and dinner.”\n\nThey’re probably not wrong.  But no one’s pregnant, I don’t have the clap, and max verstappen won the greatest race ever, which felt like sex anyway.\n\nEND",

Somewhat NSFW. \n\n\nOne (who I had an unreciprocated crush on years before then, let's call her \"Stacy\") was letting me crash at her place since the party was out of town for me. This wasn't unusual. What was unusual is that she's utterly throwing herself at me at the party. On my arm whenever I'm walking around, partnering up for every drinking game. At one point a bunch of us are sat on the floor playing cards and she drags a chair up behind me, sits down, wraps her legs around me, and starts playing with my hair. Exchanged weird looks with everyone else who was playing since none of us were expecting this from her and she was not a characteristically affectionate person.\n\nOther mutual friend at the party (let's call her \"Hannah\") makes a move on me later when a bunch of us are sat on a couch under a huge blanket watching a movie.  At this point in my life, I had been single for a time, and had remarked to Stacy about a week before that Hannah was cute and I wouldn't mind getting to know her better. Conveniently, Stacy was in the next room talking with the homeowners. I'm sat on the end, so Hannah asks me to move in so she can join us. She sits down, wraps one arm around me and just gently puts her other hand on my junk. Again, prior to this evening she had never shown me an ounce of affection before, so I'm just wondering what the fuck is going on. This lasts a few minutes, before Stacy comes back and tells me our Uber is here, so I say my confused goodbyes and leave. \n\nOn the way to the car she's giving me shit about how Hannah and I looked comfy and I told her what happened. She's pretty shocked, but asks why I didn't do anything back or stay later with her; just said I wasn't interested anymore. She's all smiles then and cozied up to me the whole ride back and also being super handsy with me. At this point we're both fairly sober, so I know it isn't her just being a drunken flirt and think \"oh shit this is really happening.\" We barely made it through the door to her apartment before we threw ourselves at each other and had sex for the first time, and were dating a month later.\n\n\nLater on in the relationship, I found out that the reason Stacy was being so forward that night was because she knew Hannah had a crush on me and was going to make a move, and so Stacy wanted to \"mark her territory\" since she also caught feelings at that point. Evidently it didn't work, but I ended up going home with Stacy that night so she called her plan a victory. Had she not been super affectionate beforehand, I absolutely would've went with Hannah instead since I was still under the impression that Stacy and I were just friends.\n\n\nNever had a girl actively try to gain my attention before that night, probably will not again in the future. But damn was it fun to be the one getting doted on for a change.\n\nEdit: People are reading way too much into this and just looking for drama. Just chill and go live your own lives instead of trying to start shit on an internet forum lmao",

One day i stayed until she was about to close the gym, and just before she closed she said she needed to do stretches because she had a dance class the next day. She invited me to do the stretches with her, i thought she meant me just helping her like pushing her down or lifting/holding something, just being of assistance to her. Instead she wanted me to do them with her, as in do the stretches myself. Now, she's a semi professional dancer practicing modern dance, her stretches are not human not something i can even think of doing. \n\nSo i bite the bullet and do them anyway because why not, she's nice and its kinda funny toppling over every time i try to do something. Anyway, at some point we were to do one of those stretches where you sit down, put the soles of your feet up against each other, pull them as close to your body as you can while still keeping them on the floor, and then push your knees down while bending forward. After toppling over a couple times i managed to get stable and actually do it but i cant get my knees very low because im stiff as fuck and have shortened tendons in my legs. She laughs her ass off literally rolling on the floor crying from laughter. \n\nSo to help me she gets up behind me, mounts me, literally climbs on my back, spreads her legs around my ribs and starts pushing down my knees with her own knees. All she had to do was stand in front of me and push my knees down with her palms, but instead of doing that she saddles me like a horse. She ends up falling over me and i grab her as she's falling over so she doesnt hit the ground face first. It ends up looking like one of those cringe cliche anime moments. She fell on her back and i fell on top of her with my hands around her. Safe to say i had a hard time keeping my composure because she's really good looking being a dancer and all. \n\nIt really didnt feel aggressive at the time, i found it pretty cute honestly. We ended up having an impromptu date that night, when i asked her why on earth would she mount me like that she said that she just wanted a reason to climb on me.

We did the typical high school thing, we all went to the mall to chill and catch a movie and I met this girl and we hit it off. Spent the entire night joking around to ourselves. We exchanged numbers and everything and spent the next day talking through text.\nWell, come Monday her friend walked up to me and didn’t ask me if I liked her which is the normal way of doing things. Her friend just flat out told me the girl liked me and showed me the text messages between them. So I had no doubts in my mind after that when I asked her out.\n\nBy the way this same friend who did that, is now my best friend and she did the same thing again with my most recent gf. Before we started dating she was in the gc talking about me and she asked my friend if she could introduce us and then she just showed me the messages, and asked me if I was interested.  Idk if you count that we aggressively coming on to someone since it wasn’t directly at me, but it really cuts a lot of the bullshit out of the way.\n\nThere was another time where this girl that I absolutely hated because I had a gf a little bit before that and this girl was always trying to get my gf to leave me, always telling her how I wasn’t shit, how she could do better, always making up scenarios to make her think I was cheating on her or get her really paranoid, etc. So some time later after me and that girl broke up, her shitty friend who I hated actually did try to hook up with me and I turned her down.  The way it went down was that she used to fuck this guy in the group, but then on our vacation trip another friend of mine kept asking her for a blowjob and she kept refusing him but eventually she actually did sneak into his room late at night while he was drunk and gave him head. Then at a night club she went and fucked some other guy outside by the side of the club. So we were at the pool and one by one our group started going inside and it was just four of us, me, her, and two other guys. Well they started joking how she was just eating up all the guys, and while the two guys were laughing she turns to me and whispers “I’d much rather eat you” :/\nThen when we went inside she came into my room to “chill” and she laid down with her head on my lap, and she just started talking about sex. So I just said excuse me and got up to go play pool with another friend of mine.\nWell the girl got mad and started going around telling everyone that I was gay after that.

Anyway, one day I'm at my mom's house which I was preparing for sale, and she shows up at my door bringing me some items from her mom's estate that apparently my mom had given them. She talked her way inside which was no big deal, but then she proceeded to pull her top off, revealing she was not wearing a bra. I am pretty sure if I were under 30, I would have hit that. She did have a nice body. But by the time I was 45, I had enough experience to know, this would only go badly. \n\nI made it clear she needed to dress and leave.

She always said hi to me and tried to talk to me in class, sometimes sat right next to me, I had lost a ton of weight and changed my style so I had never gotten this much attention from girls before. She once mentioned how handsome I was and eventually asked for my number, the aggressive thing she did was ask me if I wanted a ride home(she owned a car) and I politely declined. She kept insisting, following me as I walked towards the bus stop in her car, and I was like no I'm good thanks. I was not used to this type of attention so it was overwhelming, she was really nice though except for that incident. Nothing ever came from this though, still had insecurities that I needed to work on.",

Well another 5ish minutes pass while we're waiting for a table and she's getting a little more brazen she starts sending her friends into the restaurant(we were waiting inside the restaurant and she was waiting outside the restaurant) to come scope me out they would come into the restaurant for 2 seconds pretend to look at a painting in the wall, look at me from the side of their eye and walk back out then go back and talk to the girl. \n\nNow I start to panic, last thing I would want is for one of them to walk up to us and try to get my number or something in front of my wife. So I just stare in front of me directly at my friend and don't move my head for the rest of the time we're waiting for a table. I also move closer to my wife to try to make us look more like a couple but didn't want to do too much pda because our friend we're with has had a rough go of it lately and is prone to depression and I try to do PDA in front him since I don't wanna throw our relationship in his face and whatever we're gunna get a table soon and not see this girl again and if I'm being honest I liked the attention. I never considered myself conventionally attractive and it was nice being wanted for once.\n\nWell this girl starts getting even more brazen and now she starts tapping on the window to try to get my attention I keep my eyes locked on my friend though. Then she starts tapping louder and making an ahem sound. My wife and our friend are pretty into their dialogue and the restaurant is loud so they don't notice but now I'm getting really nervous then she gets up and starts walking in the restaurant and now im really freaking out. Enough is enough I move closer to my wife and hold her hand for a bit and our phone buzzes letting us know our table is ready thank God.

I'm too high to really register what to do here- I don't want to ruin the vibe but everyone was staring at me and her while she was doing this- super fucking awkward.\n\nShe then gets up and starts aexually grinding on me- \"I'm like yo you gotta chill\"\n\nHer husband has to pull her away and they get into an argument in the corner in front of everyone. (We are all like wtf is going on with this chick) the only things we hear are him say in a stern voice \"I swear I will fucking leave you\" and she goes \"Whether you like it or not ITS HAPPENING\" and storms off.\n\nBro fuckkkkk that\n\nFast forward to later that night I'm drunk and stoned as shit hanging in one of the rooms looking out the window, sitting in a chair the room is spinning I literally can't walk straight anymore. Here she comes drunk as shit- plops herself on the bed, and starts detailing how she wants me to fuck her in graphic detail while playing with herself.\n\nShe rolls off the bed starts crawling towards me, and I'm so fucking crossfaded at this point I feel like I'm literally stuck and she is closing in on me with no witnesses.

This manager was also the best friend of my friend's sister, so I often saw her outside of work. She had a weird habit of licking people's faces which I managed to dodge. One time, outside of work, she says, \"Hey, batkevn... I just realized we aren't at work.\" I thought she was going to lick my face so I turned to walk away. She grabbed my ass instead.\n\n3) Recently got out of a relationship and my friends invited me to some con I had no interest in, but it was a way to get out of the house. A friend of a friend (a very attractive woman) invited us back to her house after. Went to the bathroom and as I was unlocking the door to leave the bathroom the door immediately opens and the woman forces her way in and closes the door behind her. I was very confused, then she rushes toward me and grabs my crotch. I awkwardly explain that I wasn't ready for something like that right now.

I felt kinda bad, but I was young and  stupid, and the lesbian girl turned into a fun friends with benefits situation for a few months until I accidentally stepped on her ferret when I was getting out of bed to go to the bathroom one night. \n\nThere was one other funny incident involving this girl, one night when we were hooking up, her ex girlfriend came over to her place to get her stuff. She panics and tells me to hide, because she doesn’t want her ex to know she’s bi and likes guys too for some reason. So she stuffs me in the closet. I found it ironic",

We parted ways for a while but I could tell throughout the evening that she couldn't handle her booze.\nWell my date showed and I really wanted to spend some time with her and it was rapidly approaching midnight. We got into a conversation with her, her friend, my friend, and myself. But the girl from earlier, apparently shunned from a midnight kiss from every other warm male at the party, comes over and starts pawing at my chest and leaning into me. I tried to push her away but she absolutely refused and clung to me even harder. I felt really bad for her because she was sloppy drunk and apparently sad but I am also not one to get super upset so I told her to beat it as nicely as I could. Well she mumbled something and didn't get the picture, continuing to stroke my chest as my date looked on with increasingly furious eyes. Eventually, when this girl had been refused by me multiple times, my date went to my other side and started pawing at me in the same manner, which sparked some sort of weird competition between them to see who could win my favor, despite me obviously being more comfortable with one of them. It got to the point where my date was rubbing my chest under my shirt and I had the realization that this was the oddest combination of awesome and terrible that I had ever experienced up to that point because all of this was happening while a conversation continued around it, the participants of the conversations doing their best to pretend it wasn't happening. After being held at elbow length and receiving death glares from my date, this drunk chick got the picture and sulked over to her equally trashed group of friends and I got an excellent NYE kiss from someone that I knew for a fact was into me.",

It was awful for so many reasons. My friend hadn’t had much luck with girls, so it was legit cruel of them to do that to him. They manipulated him to try to get me manipulated into going with them. If I ever had a shred of interest in the girl in the first place, I was long gone by then. Oh and the girl who was brought along for my friend didn’t have any interest in him and was just doing it as a favor. Just a real shit show.",

We'll call her \"Lotus\". She was beautiful, tall, middle eaatern/European, olive skin, greenish eyes, trendy, super well dressed.. pretty well off, ran a successful business that catered to wealthy clients, lived in a ridiculous 3 story mansion over looking the bay, threw fundraisers and art openings in her livingroom, and would appear in the social mags from a ritzy neighborhood and such, so she worked there strictly for the social aspect. Way out of my league.\n\nOne night she asked if I wanted to join her and some of the ild school staff for drinks. The older staff were career restaurant workers. Back then one could make a really nice living in restaurants and those jobs were sought after. They were sort of the upper echelon of the staff. So of course I wanted to go. I felt like I was getting invited to hang out with in crowd. \n\nWe get to this nice restaurant that has a late night scene, and all is well. Some more of her friends show up and I'm sort of feeling out of place. No big deal,I'm social, I can hold my own. But I decide to get some air and smoke a cigarette to take a minute and access my situation and intoxication. \n\nI get outside and start chatting with a couple girls my age.. we're flirting and joking. No big deal because I'm just out with coworkers. \n\nWell, then Lotus comes outside. She stands firm in front of me, my eyes see her stilettos, then travel up her legs to her skirt taut by her stance, her hand on her hip and her eyes are locked on me... \n\n\"Do you think I invited you out with me so I could watch you flirt with some little girls?\" she asked, then walks back inside.\n\nI promptly rejoined the party inside.",

And I see this girl making her way through the loosely gathered crowd. As she walked by, every other dude would shoe her away, as she did something to them. She worked her towards me  and I was wondering, what is she doing.  Before you know it, I see her fondle the guys crotch, who was standing within feet of me. I'm thinking to myself that i hope she comes fondle me. Low and behold , she rubs my crotch area as she is walking by. Unlike all the other guys, I dont stop her. She feels me up breifly for about 8 seconds, then walks away, only to circle back around 20 seconds later. She is getting more aggresdive, as I stand there, letting her grope me all she wants. Im hard as a rock. She then grabs my hand and leads me away from the crowd. Next, she calls her girl friends overwhile next to me. She unzips my pants and her and her girl friends start touching and caressing my dick. It was maybe 6-7 girls. I started fingering one of her friends, as she didnt have on any panties. They wanted to take a group picture with them holding my dick. So, there is a picture of me out there with a group of girls and my cock.\n\n* I used to take the public bus from school. And once, I was sitting down and there were no more seats on the bus. So, this girl asks if she can sit in my lap. I oblige. And no less than 20 seconds, she turns to me and quietly says, i feel your *boing boing*. I smiled. And, that bus right had to be the shortest, as i was enjoying every bounce.\n\n* fastforward to last year. I was taking a piss in at a bar in a restroom, and apparently forgot to lock the door. Then this cute girl barges in, then sees me, and says OH, I WONT LOOK. To which I said, you can look, so she looked at my cock. Then she started twerking with some shorts on. She turned around and gave me a blow job in the bathroom. When it started, we both reached to lock the door. She even swallowed...",

At the wedding she said things like “do you even dance?” But kept saying it like she was kind of making fun of me (I know now girls do this sometimes, just look at Hey Arnold), and I told my girlfriend and she was like “Aw you should have danced with her she clearly wanted you to” which at the time I was still naive. \nLater that night, we stayed in a hotel room with her and she spent a good half hour on the floor in her dress facing me with her legs open and I could see right up there. My girlfriend was too drunk to notice and was talking to her on our bed. The girl kept glancing over to me, throwing her head back, moving her dress straps down and shit. Then she went up and said she was gonna take a shower after my gf fell asleep and she went in there and didn’t even close the door all the way. I could have easily walked up to the door and saw her in the mirror, I’m sure she wanted me to, but I didn’t cuz I was tired and honestly at a place in my life where I would never cheat or anything like it. Funny how girls pick up on that and try to get you to. \n\nTLDR: my girlfriends best friend broke up with her boyfriend the night before a wedding we all attended. She asked me to dance several times, opened her legs directly at me in the hotel, and left a shower door open in a hotel room we al shared while my gf was drunk and sleeping.",

Karate girl just so happens to live very close to me, and offers to drive me home. I knew she had a couple drinks, but I didn’t really think it through because everyone simultaneously agreed that it makes so much sense for her to “drop me off” at my house since it’s “on the way”. \n\nThis girl is driving a 350z and she wanted to let me know how fast she can drive it. We end up spinning out on the highway because she hit a 40 mph turn at 70, and we slammed into the wall. Luckily no one else was on the road and no one got hurt, but I remember going into that turn thinking “Oh shit, this isn’t gonna work”. I naturally grabbed the “oh shit” handle and braced myself for impact. \n\nWe were kinda dazed for a minute then we got out and assessed the damage. Her car looked fucked but the concrete wall looked just fine.

Fairly small wedding, and the reception was in some blues club at a casino. \n\nThere wasn’t a large number of dudes, basically the groom, 3-4 of his friends, myself, and the father of the bride.\n\nThe parents of the bride were divorced recently and he showed up with his new g/f. She was your typical looking mid-late 50s woman, she was short, thin - kinda old Maria Shriver-esque. He was one of those guys were you can look at him and immediately tell he is a bit of a jackass. \n\nReception wound down and we are all posed for a group photo. I was standing in the back, and on my right was my wife and on my left was the Father of the brides new g/f. When the photographer indicated that everyone get ready for the photo - the father of the brides new g/f shoved her hand/arm down the back of my pants to the elbow, goes between my thighs, and grabs grabs my balls. I look at her stunned and she winks, extracts, and wanders off. My wife seen this happen and though it was hilarious. We informed her friend (the bride) the next day - and apparently the woman had also hardcore groped one of the grooms friends as well. \n\nHadn’t seen any of them since. Lol.",

A platonic friend of mine who had recently broken up with her long time bf called me out of the blue and said, “I am turned on by muscles. Can I come over and suck your dick and it be nothing more?” which of course I agreed to. I’ll be damned if she didn’t come over, push me to my room and against my bed, pulled my pants down, did the deed, swallowed, thanked me, and politely bud me farewell to go on with her day. We stayed friends and it was never weird and her and the bf got back together. Beautiful experience.\n3.\tIn my mid 20s I was dating a girl I met on Tinder. She accompanied me out downtown to a club with my friends one night. We knew the door guy and he let us cut the line (we bought him drinks as was customary) and as we were leaving, a guy standing nearby who allegedly was mad we had cut earlier apparently started to tip his drink on my shoulder as I walked by, but this girl *open hand uppercutted his drink into the air so hard it hit the ceiling sending liquid everywhere over the crowd* and started cursing him out. It was more of a red flag to me than anything honestly, and sure enough, shortly after we stopped talking she MARRIED a dude she had casually talked to for two weeks and verbally denigrated in front of me a few times. Big unstable vibes.\n\nIdk if those are all super aggressive, but the last one I think so.\n\nedit: Also, a tinder date in my late 20s once was real boozy when we met and just straight up lifted her shirt to show me her titty with a like, “yeah bitch can you handle this level of rogue?” energy.",

We talked about school and the party and then she asked me out of the blue if I ever had been with a girl. I blushed super embarrassed and answered the truth:“No, I haven’t.“ My mind was racing so much I didn‘t even know what to ask back - pure Adrenaline for young me pulse to 180+.\nShe told me that I should close my eyes and give her my hand. I thought that she would kiss me and put my hand around her waist or something but she put my hand in her skirt, in her panties, rubbing it on her vagina up and  down while spreading her legs and my god she was soaking wet. I think I got an instant boner if that’s biologically possible.\nShe asked me if I liked it. I was not able to talk and just nodded and moaned. She took it out, started giggling and told me that I could open my eyes again. (I KEPT THEM CLOSED FOR GODS SAKE!)\n\nNever experienced anything as fast forward like that ever again with a woman.\n\nRest of the story that probably contains one of the most embarrassing memories:\nShe asked me if we can go somewhere else - I didn’t have a will of my own that moment so I just kept nodding (oh my, what an ape). The house where the party was, was one of the last houses of my town and had a barn. We went in there.\nTurns out, she was quite experienced , she first kissed me, opened my pants and wanked me a bit and I think I came within 2-5 seconds. Thank god she stood a bit beside me. I was so embarrassed and moaned that I‘m sorry and she was super cool about it and kissed me.\n\nAnd then she whispered :“ Since I have your cum on my hands I cannot finish of myself can you help me?“\n\nI said yes, she told me exactly what to do and it was fucking amazing. After she came, she thanked me and kissed me again.\n\nWe walked back washed our hands in the fountain between house and barn and went back to the party.\n\nShe gave me the cold shoulder after this, maybe because I was so inexperienced.",

We had a pretty big party house with people coming and going all the time so it wasn't THAT unusual.\n\nShe immediately (like within 5 mins of arriving) starts coming on to me.   Starts licking her lips.  Asks if she can suck my dick.  Sticks her hand down her pants and shows me how wet she is on her fingers.  You get the point.  I had no idea what the relationship was between her and my friend and this was like the mid 90s so cell phones weren't exactly ~~a thing~~ ubiquitous yet.  I had no way to contact him.  I thought maybe he liked her so I was trying to be a good dude.\n\nDeclined her advances for almost 2 hours.  Finally locked myself in my room and left her alone out in the house cuz I was about to cave.  My roommate got home at some point and not long after he arrives I hear moaning and sucking sounds.  Sure enough, she sucked him off.  LOL\n\nFound out the next day the reason my friend dropped her off was so I could fuck her.  I'm like dude, a heads up would be great next time.  Found out a few days after that from someone else that she had been passed around a party the week prior and had sex with dozens of dudes.  Glad I passed.  Never saw her again.",

The entire time I couldn't figure out why she wanted to study with me because she knew all of the material better than I did. It was like two weeks later that I found out she had a crush on me. I regret this one because she was super nice but it wasn't obvious and I got involved with someone basically at the same time I found out about her \n\nSecond one was this very religious but total bombshell of a girl in college constantly hitting on me and posting on my Facebook about how she liked to tell all her friends about me and stuff. One time we were both in a restaurant at nearby tables during families week and her family overheard my order. She proceeded to post on my Facebook about how her dad said we were soulmates and she agreed. Because I was a heathen womanizer I respected her too much to ever pursue anything, but at the time it was not completely obvious she liked me as I thought she was just fucking with me 🤷\n\nThird one was a girl sliding into my DMs, within 1-2 hours of us messaging she asked me to come over to her dorm to watch a movie and kept telling me she lives alone and really wanted some company. Within about 5 minutes of being in her room she jumps up on her bunk bed and invites me up.

From time to time I’ve tried the “sugar daddy” thing. Shame me if you want, but I’ve had great experiences. I don’t see anyone under 21f. I also have dated normally as well, just fyi.  \n\nAnyway, went on a date with one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen, 21f. The reason for the date was because we matched on a dating site and she wanted to talk about a “sugar” relationship, because I make good money and was willing to spoil her with shopping or whatever (which she wants) and she’s hot (which I want). But there’s mutual attraction and we both want more than just sex/money as well, we wanted to spend quality time together too. So we have the date, and there is massive chemistry. After a few drinks, we’re in the parking lot making out and she’s grabbing my dick and everything. Just super aggressive… never been with anyone like that before or since. Mind you at this point there still hasn’t been any “sugar” in this. \n\nThe next day we’re texting and sexting, and she says she wants to come over and fuck me. Of course, at this point I think “ok, I’m going to have to spoil her with money or gifts or something. There had to be some catch.” Nope. She just comes over. I kinda confront her about it and mention the sugar part of it all…. She says (paraphrasing here) “oh, I don’t care about that, I just wanna fuck you”. \n\nSuffice it to say, it was amazing. We saw each for 3 months after that. Of course the age gap was the issue from anything progressing beyond just being something causal. \n\nMost aggressive, and one of the hottest, women I’ve ever met in my life.",

That's the TLDR version.\n\nFirst was the day I lost my virginity. September 1st 2007, first home football game of the season at University of South Carolina. Key point to keep in mind: I grew up getting next to no female attention, so assumed I just had no game, and wasn't even trying, as evidenced I was still a virgin at this point.\n\nAnyhow, game hasn't even started, I'm stumbling to a spit in the student section, when a hand comes out of nowhere and grabs my ass. I turn around, confused and irritated, assuming one of my drunk friends was playing some gay chicken/grabass. Instead I see an absolutely stunning short blonde in a black sundress and pearls (that's the standard for girls at South Carolina games) staring at me with the reddest face/embarrassed grin on her face. Way outta my league by a long shot, at least in my mind previous to that day. Anyhow, with a level of confidence and game that I no idea I had, I move up close to her and say \"you missed\". She looks confused, since she'd definitely not missed grabbing my ass a second ago. I get a mischievous grin on my face and glance down at my crotch - which she catches and gets the hint, and goes in for a grab. In the middle of the stadium in front of her friends and everything. She gets a good feel of everything, and with a look of pleasant surprise on her face, moves her hand to mine and leads me out of the stadium to her place (a long walk to basically anywhere from that stadium, as anyone who knows Columbia knows). Don't regret missing that game.\n\nSecond was St. Patties Day street festival in Columbia SC, after I'd graduated. Had been hanging out and barhopping with a \"just friends\" female friend and a gaggle of her friends, when this female friend had to go find her sorority \"little sister\" who was drunk and lost. So, I tag along and play \"follow the drunken clues to find the missing sorority sister\". We spot her, very pretty, short, curvy and auburn-haired in the distance, just hanging out waiting to get into a bar. Unbeknownst to me, this was actually a setup by my friend to introduce me to her friend, which, a soon as we got up close, like within 10 ft or so, we start exchanging greetings, and me, being the dorky to a fault gentleman put my hand out to shake her hand in a semi formal manner. She puts her hand out too...and goes straight past mine and grabs me by the crotch, almost painfully hard, and pulls me in by my crotch for a very deep and passionate (and honestly messy) kiss. We ended up spending the rest of the afternoon together as a group, and then later that night she asks where I'm staying...and for once I get the hint and tell her the hotel I'm staying at. A good night.",

One girl was so wasted, she made out with a girl in the pool and five minutes later, was berating me to have sex with her even though she had brought a guy with her to the party. Her crazy energy already told me to stay away, but I had a girlfriend and she brought a date so it was never going to happen. She actually did this two or three different times and it got more aggressive every time. As annoying as it was, it isn’t my worst story of a girl hitting on me. One girl followed me around the house all night and ended up in the room we were playing beer pong in. I accidentally fell asleep on the couch and woke up to her laying on me. It freaked me out but I just got up and went upstairs. I realized my phone was missing so I go back to get it.

I didn’t really pay attention to it, but then they would start brushing up against me “by accident” whenever I walked by them in my hall or was at my locker. It progressively got more aggressive where they would start touching my ass. They’d ask me to show my underwear to them and then they’d guess which one I’d be wearing whenever they’d run into me. It got even more aggressive, but I don’t think I will mention that part here. \n\n-Two girls I was seeing (at different times) asked me to marry them. I declined both.

Walked her home, polite kiss and I was ready to never see her again….\n\nFast forward a week or so later she comes into my work and wants to help with her phone. Sure, I’m not gonna not do my job because we had no chemistry. Can’t remember exactly how but she basically got me to look at her pictures where there was treasure trove of nudes of her…. Like nothing but that so she knew what I’d see. I look up at her awkwardly she smiled flirtatiously. Then we went out a couple more times and hooked up. But would kind of drift apart due to that lack of chemistry outside of sex.\n\nThe weird part was that she’d played this cat and mouse with me like 3 times at work whenever we hadn’t talked for a while….wait she was just using me for a lay when she wanted it wasn’t she????",

One of my roommates was bragging about his brand new $600 powdered glass multi chambered bong and proceeded to invite said neighbor couple and their friend over to smoke.\n\nFlash forward 3 hours later and the the neighbors decide they've had fun but they're calling it a night.

We look at each other like, \"uuuh, wtf is this girl doing still sitting here, her friends just left..\" I sit back down on the couch to watch TV or something and she gets up and sits right next to me, basically on my lap, and just quietly stares at the TV. I'm thinking, man this is strange as fuck. \"So, you doing okay? Everything good?\" She looks at me smiling and says something like, \"oh yeah I'm doing much better now smiling at me.\" My roommates start cracking up and get up and walk back to their rooms while leaving me out there with her. I'm definitely not interested so I'm trying to politely drop signals that I'm tired, want to go bed, and she should kindly gtfo out of my house but she DOESN'T LEAVE.

            "text": "I’m going to need to explain a couple things for this to make sense, I apologize in advance for the length-\n\nI managed a Sonic a while ago. I preferred to take up “expo” position while managing on shift, because it’s in the center of everything, staff had to pass me to go anywhere, everything is visible, and is the final quality control step before orders are handed out.\n\nOne of the other managers preferred “car hop”, (the ones on skates that run orders out to the cars in the stalls), because of similar reasons- she could ensure the best service on her shifts and prevent any issues with orders preemptively, and zoomed around the whole store in a split second to check everything. Also- the tips, because she could showcase her “I skate and squat 8 hours a day, every day, for almost a decade” assets in leggings. She made the most tips. \n\nSometimes the schedule worked out that we’d be on the same shift, or our shifts would overlap a couple hours or something.\n\nWe all had headsets for taking orders (there were 25 different spots that people could pull up to and ring in an order, potentially all at the same time- no lines, but sometimes a que on the telecom until someone is done talking to another customer), and there were computers stationed all over the place, to ring in orders wherever you were at. So instead of being signed in to a specific computer to take an order in your name, or having to punch in a login every time, we had cards on little spring-loaded clips so we could just pull it from hanging on our belt or pocket, stretch the line out to swipe real quick, we’d be logged in, then just drop the card and punch in the order and the card would suck/reel itself back in against the clip on your belt/pocket/shirt, and you’d automatically be logged out after the order so no one could do shady shit or make a mistake under your name. \n\nI’m tall, there is no standardized counter or standing computer setup that is built for my height. So instead of the polo pocket that the short girl managers used, my card stayed on my front pocket, close to the front, hanging down, closest to where I would have to swipe when standing at a computer. \n\nThis carhop manager, literally between everything she did- grabbing something for a customer, helping an employee, going out back for a smoke, literally anything- because I was at expo, (remember everyone had to go by me to go anywhere) she’d take the opportunity to speed past me in her skates, grab the card hanging from my pocket closest to my front aggressively, and pull it with her as she zoomed by, looking over her shoulder smirking and squatting/bending slightly forward as you do when speeding on skates (she was very proud of this particular asset of hers, it wasn’t a secret, everyone mentioned it, she liked the attention and would mention it herself, it was just one of those few in your life you see where everyone, straight gay lesbian, whatever, is just like “wow… that’s like two perfect basketballs packed in there”, attracted to her or not, like literally everyone recognized it as notable, especially with her tiny frame and waist, it was *literally* cartoonish) then release it when it went it’s furthest, about 4ft, and let it shoot back and slap either on or around my goods, depending on the pants I was wearing, at my inner thigh or under my zipper area. \n\nThis happened, usually, idk, 8-36 times a day when we worked together. Sometimes twice while I was taking the same order- I’m stuck at the screen and can’t say anything because I’m talking to the customer. \n\nIt was excessive, to say the least. Especially since this only started happening after I left my phone at the desk one day, after messaging a girl I was hooking up with, to run and help a customer quickly, and the gm (her best friend), her, and another shift manager girl decided to go through it (this was during shift change so we’d all chill and update each other in the office for a bit between the different shifts of employees coming in) I knew what they found after I heard various hysterics and exclamations.  And they changed my name in the system to “HORSE”, as a joke so it would print out on receipts that I handed out that way, and started calling me that every day. Our name tags were magnetic, and I’d lose mine, so i just kept mine attached to the filing cabinet in the office and the next day I came in, they had changed that to Horse, too. Funny. \n\nWe were all close friends for a long time, but, that was all very, very excessive and aggressive attention-grabbing after that. \n\nI ended up dating the other shift manager girl that was there, and didn’t have such an extreme aggressive reaction. That didn’t stop her one bit, everyone else including the GM and my new gf just laughed at it no matter how much I told her to fuck off. \n\nSupervisor would come in, routinely check the system real quick, and ask “who’s horse, is that you??” And they’d just laugh while I embarrassingly explained it was a silly meaningless inside joke, and that the GM did it, but yeah those numbers are me. \n\nThat’s probably the most aggressive any woman has gotten with me about it. \n\nI had a Snapchat stalker once after a one night stand- she’d literally snap me pics of my house, or pics of me at work when I couldn’t see her, this went on for a few months. But that was just creepy af, not so much aggressive.",

Apparently she tried to have sex with me but I told her no because I didn't have a condom.  So she left, got a condom from a housemate of mine (who had no idea what was going on), then proceeded to fuck me.  When the condom broke in the middle of the act she noticed but didn't tell me because, as she would apparently tell her roommates later, she was hoping if she got knocked up than she'd be set off the child support.  I definitely noticed her after that but more in the 'avoid at all costs' kind of way so I don't think it worked like she thought it would.\n\ntl;dr raped me",

The gate/flight is nearly empty and I’m reading a book minding my own, a cutie comes over and says her seat is next to some creepy guy and could I change her seat next to mine. Sure, so I get gate attendant to fix it, now she’s next to me. Keep in mind plane is nearly empty, she could sit anywhere. We board, take off, I go back to reading my book. After 10 minutes of silence in the air, chic takes my book from me and writes her ph# in it, so we start talking. Vibing together really well, another 20 minutes go by, it’s a late night flight so lights are low, no one seated near us for like 3-4 rows. She reaches over and drops the little seat table from in front of me, she leans over and says “go back to reading your book.” Next thing I know her hand is in my lap groping hard, finding the zipper and the hand job light is lit! I, of course, unload on her hand and my pants. She just looks straight ahead and licks her fingers. I spill some water we got later to drink in my lap and embarrassed I ask flt attendant for napkins to dry it. We land and we’re talking and getting bags. She says “call me and we’ll do some more.” then leaves to her car and gone. We hit it again about 3 times, then the next time I call, a guy answers says he’s her dad and she left to go to basic training in the Air Force. She must like the flying thing. 😝😝",

Her roommate came home from a bar excessively drunk. Like, very possibly the most drunk I have ever seen someone. My friend and I had been watching a movie, so I had been sitting on the edge of one of their beds while my friend was in a chair. Drunk roomie collapses on the bed next to me, seemingly asleep almost instantly. My friend goes to the dorm next door to get a couple of their other friends to help deal with drunk roomie. A few seconds after my friend left, drunk roomie gets up, starts to walk toward the door, and then just falls into a pile on the floor. I’m about to start trying to help her up when she sits up, leans toward me, and starts putting her mouth and hands all over the front of my pants while mumbling something and periodically crossing her eyes. There was drool, she clearly was incoherent and absurdly drunk, and I genuinely was concerned for her at this point. She was basically trying to give me head through my pants, but was too drunk to either remove my pants or realize that they were even there. That only lasted for about 5 seconds, but it felt like an eternity. \n\nThe moment that sticks with me the most is when my friend came back after hearing drunk roomie fall down, and she appeared in the doorway just as I’m holding my hands up in a “what the fuck are you doing, what is happening” sort of way while her roommate, with a BAC of 1.0, was at her absolute drunkest and most sloppy. Her face had a look that said a mixture of “I’m sorry, what the fuck, is she ok, are you ok” and I suspect I looked a little confused as well. \n\nAbout 30 min later we had to take drunk roomie to the ER to have her stomach pumped.

I figured she just wanted a FWB considering I had just gotten out of a 2 yr + relationship. So we had sex a few more times. Things started going sideways when she started messaging me all the time. Then showed up at my work. At the time I worked at Walmart and she was asking a few of my friends where I was located. One who already knew about what was going on told her he hadn't seen me though he had while another told her I was there. She sat around the store for like 2-3 hrs waiting for me. I knew that was a bad sign already. So I followed the backroom of the store and made my way out through the Lawn and Garden exit.

They were from Seattle and had nothing to do with the Cubs game. After about 20 minutes one of the whispers in my ear to come with them back to their room. I end up boning both of them separately. Once I got done with the first one the second said something to the effect of “my turn”. It was a shocking, yet outstanding turn of events. \n\nThe second time was after a party bus tour in Minneapolis for a friend’s bachelor party. Once again, last man standing. I ordered a round of shots for a group of people that were in town for a convention, and came a few days early to explore Minneapolis. Two of the gals in that group corner me after a while and one quite loudly asked if I want to have a threesome with them. Everyone within 10 feet of us heard, due to the loud alcohol talk, and when I accepted a few people applauded lol. Not the bartender though. For some reason he was pissed and cut us off. So we dipped back to their room and this time it was more like a true threesome with girls getting each other off while I was going at it from the back. It was like a bucket list checked moment.",

            "text": "I'm pretty late to the party, and this is a bit of a long story. This happened during my community college years, circa 2004-2005.\n\nI was on the second floor of the science building and I saw this girl I knew from my science class, \"Janice\", leaning on the railing and just staring at the floor below with with this beaten-down, down-trodden look on her face. I don't know what it was exactly, but I had this gut feeling that she was contemplating jumping. \n\nI went over to Janice and talked with her, I had about an hour before my next class, and she really looked like she could benefit from a friendly face, we hadn't really spoken much before this, but our science lab was a small class and the prof would call roll for attendance, like in high school. \n\nAfter some initial hesitancy, Janice just let loose. Her life was in shambles. She was engaged to a drug addict, who was verbally and emotionally abusive towards her child, and verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive towards Janice herself. She pulled her scarf off to show me the bruising on her neck from where he had choked her the night before. She told me a neighbor heard the fighting and called the cops, apparently the responding officers found her sobbing on the floor, saw her bruising, and her fiancé was so high that he attacked one of the cops, so they arrested him. \n\nI can't put into words how horrifying this experience must've been for her, it made my stomach churn, and she just told the story with this utterly flat facial expression and a dull vocal tone- to make a comparison, it was the sort of tone someone would use to describe their grocery list to a significant other. \"Oh, I stopped at the store, picked up a roast, some potatoes, carrots, onions- wanna have pot roast for dinner tomorrow?\"\n\nI was 19 or 20 at the time, and had no idea how to respond to this. I did my best to offer sympathy and recommended she move out, immediately if possible, and if not, contact the campus health center, maybe they could help. Janice thanked me for listening, and said she had to get to class. This was right at the end of fall semester. I did not see Janice again and thought no more about the matter. \n\nTowards the end of spring semester, I had convinced a childhood friend who attended a different college to get up early on a Sunday and have breakfast with me at a local diner, the plans were I would pick up my friend from his childhood home and we would carpool to the diner. \n\nWe made these plans for breakfast because I was working 6 days a week, graveyard shift, at a local grocery store, and as I pull up and park in my friend's driveway, my phone rings. It's a local number I don't recognize.  \n\nQuick soliloquy: Janice knew I worked nights, I had begged the professor of that fall science lab to give us at least a week to complete assignments at the beginning of the semester, as I had Tuesday nights off and did all of my assignments that were due on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning.\n\nBack to the story: Low and behold, it's Janice calling. She is excited because her ex-fiance was recently given a lengthy prison sentence, and now she and I can be together! I asked how she had gotten my number, and she told me, \"I 411'd every town in the state looking for everyone with your last name, and kept trying each number, until this morning, when I got your mother and she gave me your number! When are you free for a date?!\" She didn't seem to grasp how... awkward and creepy that came off. I politely declined and blocked her number. \n\nMy mother apologized when I arrived home for giving out my number, apparently Janice struck gold on her 411 spree at 6:30 AM and woke my mother from a dead sleep, so Mom wasn't thinking clearly when Janice called. Mom felt something was off once she'd woken up fully. \n\nAlso, Janice lied- she told my mother we were lab partners from science class and she needed my number to get lab data for an assignment that was due shortly. \n\nTL;DR: I let a college classmate vent to me on what was probably one of the worst days of her life, she proceeded to 411 every town in the state and lied to my mother to get my phone number.\n\nEdit: grammar corrections and some formatting changes made for easier reading.",

Had been out drinking in dorms and houses and generally bouncing around and chilling. We headed back to his brand new dorm at the end of the night. Most of the kids hadn’t moved in yet and my friend was an RA so was there early. After we got back I decided I wanted to pop out for a smoke. He gave me his ID, his 3 digit door code, and I was on my way. I passed the front desk on the way out and noticed a student employee sitting there now.\n\nOn my way back in, the girl at the front desk said “ID?” in an expectant tone as I walked past. Flustered, holding an ID that was not mine I mumbled something about my friends name and dorm number. She laughed and said she was just kidding. My high ass laughed and said “oh okay good night.” And I walked to my friends dorm.\n\nWhen I got there I realized, the universe, my drunken friend, or some higher power had screwed and gifted me what I needed at the same time. My friends door beeped when I touched it with the ID, I hit the three buttons, and nothing happened. I hit the first number of the code again and the door beeped red. The 3 digit code was a 4 digit code and I tried vainly for about 10 minutes to crack the extra digit. I tried a dozen calls to my friend, banging on the door and yelling but my friend sleeps like a hibernating boulder.\n\nI sullenly dredge back out to the front desk to ask the girl if she could help me. I walk up and start to explain and she was like dude I don’t work here I was just trying to start a conversation with you. At this point everything fell into place with what I swear was an audible thud because she laughed again. We chilled, she got us some beers from her room, we talked about some deep shit, then she grabbed my dick and said when are we doing this because I know where.\n\nWe fucked in the bathroom. Brand new dorm, floor smelled like a freshly laid parking lot (idk why) and pine needles.

Just to be clear nothing like this has ever happened to me again.\n\nThe test came in 3 parts.\n\nPart 1: I had just finished my last exam and I called my girlfriend from a bench on campus. As we’re talking, I notice a girl in a short skirt eyeing me as she walks by. She stops at the bench across from me with her back turned, plops her backpack down, rifles through it and drops a pen on the ground. Then proceeds to bend over in front of me. Mid-sentence I notice she’s not wearing underwear. I’m speechless. She stands up, throws the  backpack on and starts strutting away. She took one look over her shoulder to see me open mouth staring with the phone to my ear and cracks a sinister smile.\n\nPart 2: Later that day, I meet up with my girlfriend and we’re on a crowded walking street holding hands. A girl comes riding towards us on a beach cruiser, and a gust of wind blows up her skirt to reveal her crotchless panties. She sees my stupid face as I’m trying to comprehend my 2nd furburger  flash of the day, and delivers the most sultry, smokey eyed smirk I’ve seen to this day. Somehow my girlfriend missed the whole interaction.\n\nPart 3: Not one hour later, I’m standing in line at a hoppin sandwich shop just off campus. My girlfriend is waiting in the car for me to pickup dinner. Two sorority girls in front of me are arguing about the best sammie on the menu, and I have to put in my vote for the Spicy Italian. Gotta love the gabagool. We’re debating and one of them turns to me and says “You know, we have a lot of beer left over from last night’s party. We could really use some help finishing it off.” The other girl chimes in “You should totally come over and finish it off for us.” At this point I’m convinced I’m in a dream. The testosterone and confidence oozing out of me from the eventful day pushes me to go along with flirting with these beauties. After a few minutes they’re giggling and throwing looks at each other, then looking at me. One of them puts a hand on my chest. Suddenly my hands are on their waists, and we’re all just vibing in this busy sandwich shop with sexual tension through the fucking roof. Meanwhile I’m thinking about my girlfriend sitting right outside. The girls gave me an address and walked out, footlongs in hand, looking back and giggling to each other.\n\nAt this point my trials have ended. I go to my beautiful girlfriend and we celebrate our anniversary and another 7 so far!\n\nI will never understand what happened that day, but I do wish it happened when I was single! I never told anyone this story, because I doubt anyone would believe me.\n\nTLDR; I had three propositions of epic proportions from women on the same day. The day of my one-year anniversary with my gf. \n\nMain takeaways: Go to college. Or at least go to a college town on the last day of finals.",

A couple days beforehand, while out enjoying a Friday night, by coincidence my friend said she had some important documents to go to her employers head office for signatures in the same city. Rather than sending them with the delay through courier, maybe she could come with. I thought it made sense, so sure, why not?\n\nWe’d been friends for a long time, but never took anything further. This time, it was tough not to see the signs. She rode shotgun, wearing much more revealing clothes than normal. When we got to the hotel, the desk clerk offered an upgrade to a room with a king bed over the two queen beds in our reservation, and she said yes. After checking in and doing business in the city, we made plans for dinner, first deciding to head back to the hotel to change. She brought along a stunning, bright red, low-cut, mini dress that made her look … bloody hell, the pleasant memory that dress just gave me. Wow.\n\nAnyway, long story short, dinner was great, flirting was pretty subtle … seeming like she was testing me to find out if there could be something there beyond friendship. Back at the hotel, she dropped her dress before me, but I had some hesitancy because she ended up having too much wine and friendship took priority. I ended up consoling her due to the bad spot she felt she was in at life after a breakup she suffered couple months prior. I didn’t feel right taking advantage of that situation. I think, in the end, had we gone through with hooking up that night, we’d probably not have worked out. Friendship was the better play.\n\nNonetheless, she was exuding pheromones that weekend that my mind and body were at the mercy of.

I've never considered myself a lady's man by any means so an attractive woman laying it out there like that made me feel good. Imagine my surprise when I get back to the living room and she's gone! Holy crap! Did I say something wrong? Did I miss something? Before I went to the bathroom  I told her I've wanted to ask her out for a while too but didn't think she liked me that way. I was bummed out so I picked up the few beer cans on the coffee table and threw them away in the kitchen before heading for my room. I opened the door and flipped the light on to find her already naked and waiting for me. It was one of the best nights of my life. We dated afterwards for a few months but she ended up taking a job in California and I have people here that depend on me so we parted ways as friends. We still talk occasionally and I'll never forget the sight of her tanned and athletic body stretched out invitingly as I entered the room. Ah,to be young again!",

I spent the day with her on my 7th grade field trip. She basically got stuck with me and it was alright. Fast forward to 11th grade chemistry class. She ends up sitting at our table and she'd talk to me. People weren't always very nice to her. I know what it's like so I was pretty nice to her. We'd talk in class or whatever. One day, she asked for my number and I didn't want to give it to her so she stabbed me in the arm with a pencil. Naturally, I got very pissed off, broke the pencil and threw it across the room. She got mad and broke my phone. Everyone kept telling me to date her but I didn't find her attractive and wasn't interested. I didn't have a date for the homecoming dance but I usually went for the hell of going. The room was kind of dark and it was the auxiliary gym (my school had 2) and she found me and pinned me up against the wall trying to kiss me. I shoved her away and ran away. I left. I drove away faster than I ever had. A few days later I was walking my dog and I came across her. She asked for my number and I gave it to her to get her to go away. Luckily, she texted me once and that was it. It got so bad I had to get my mom to call the principal and he said to my mom \"Have you seen her? I can't imagine that happening.\" It stopped after that and she got a boyfriend shortly after. Funny part is that it was just like a TV show where a couple looks like each other so it's obvious they're a couple. Her boyfriend looked like her.

So I signaled to her to pull over and we turned down one of the side streets.  We parked in front of someone's house but it was already past 10 pm and the lights were off in the house.  We both got out of our respective cars and started to kiss.  She proceeded to pull my jeans down and started to give me head.  I was really surprised when she asked me if I liked to lick ass.  I replied by lifting her skirt and pulling off her panties.  I had her bent over on the hood of my car and proceeded to lick her butt.  She got so wet.  I really thought we were about to fuck but then she told me that her husband and kids were expecting her home soon and that she had to go.  She asked me if we could get together again later in the week and she gave me her phone number.  I went home and totally jerked off thinking of what had happened.

            "text": "Ok nobody asked me (I'm a woman) but I've never told this story and I don't know where else to ever tell it so here we go.\n\nI was flatting in the west of France with good mates, all working professionals including 2 couples, not a party flat (more of a sober hippie/spiritual/eco-friendly kind of community). One summer weekend, my mate's cousin from Paris comes to visit. I had heard all about him, been told I should get in touch because we were in a similar line of work and also knew he was in a long term relationship with a mutual acquaintance that was a big name in the field (I lived in Paris prior to this).\n\nHowever when he arrived, I didn't connect the dots as we were having a bbq and people were coming and going. I could tell he was a little lost and hadn't brought anything (in France you never go anywhere empty-handed) so I B-lined for him and said \"how dare you show up at my party with no booze, I'm taking you to the store to fix that immediately\". He leveled up the banter to a point where the only real information I obtained from him was that he wasn't local so as I drove him around on our run to the store I gave him some good views of the city (we did need more booze but I also wanted to flex with my reckless driving - and yes I've matured since). \n\nThe sexual tension was thick in the air and the flirting game was on but he wasn't making any moves. So as we parked back home I gently grabbed his cock and whispered \"thanks for giving me a hand\" in his ear. Then left him to it as I had stuff to do (sorting out music, food etc.) and also didn't want to be too aggressive I guess. Brushed past him a couple times as I was catching up with different people, served him quite a few stiff drinks, then asked him if he smoked and dragged him behind the trees to light a blunt (looked down on by most of the community). Blew the smoke into his mouth after my first pull and then kissed him quite vigorously. I felt a certain hesitation in him so as soon as we finished the blunt I left him to it again.\n\nLater we were all sitting around the fire and he was directly opposite me. I could tell he couldn't take his eyes off me. I signaled for him to follow me, but not immediately as we were all playing a game and it would be too obvious. I went back into the house and dropped my clothes, praying that no one but him would come back. He opened the door and starred at me in utter shock for what felt like an eternity, then got his shit together, picked me up and fucked me on the kitchen counter (people were sleeping in the bedrooms and the walls were paper so was the most reasonable thing to do).\n\nAfter we both hit the spot (didn't take too long as tension had been building all night) I said something like \"good game... hey I didn't ask your name? \". And suddenly it dawned on me. I was mortified. This was my mate's cousin. I came onto him so strongly and so persistently through the entire night (we're talking like 6 solid hours here) that I eventually made him cheat. He thought I knew who he was the whole time. I really looked up to his partner and was hoping to get the opportunity to work with her, and absolutely didn't want to let my mate down who was big on morals. He stayed over 2 more days. Once we'd done it once it was too hard to resist. We fucked in every single room of the house. The best sex I've ever had, probably because of the thrill and fear of being found out (the house was always full of people). But it was also awful knowing how wrong it was. 6 years later I still have flashbacks of this that get me wet. \n\nI'm a horrible person, here you have my confession.",

Not sure why, we were drinking in the dorms. Girl is getting more and more explicit in her talking and 💥 suddenly it clicked in my brain: she wants to fuck. Mind you, this is like 30 seconds before she literally says she wants to have sex with me (in front of my roommate and a couple other people; we were alone). She proceeds to grab my face and start making out with it. I wasn’t interested…most of the time I’ve noticed aggressive girls aren’t as hot (or they didn’t used to be hot to me when I was young; I’ve changed my mind since). As we are making out I’m thinking about how to reject her without hurting her feelings but also thinking that she doesn’t really want me. I don’t recall what happened but we never had sex and I don’t think I had to physically reject her. Maybe it was the awkward one sided make out “sesh.”\n\nAnother time I was sober as fuck. I was tired and waiting for my friends and sat down at this picnic table outside. Didn’t even notice the sloshed girl next to me…but she both noticed me and (I am guessing) assumed I was trying to hit on her. Dunno. Anyway, can’t remember how, but somehow she is essentially saying that “sure,” we can dance. I’m confused and suddenly have this girl I’m afraid is gonna puke on me swaying in my arms. She is randomly giggling and I’m essentially holding her up at this point, not sure what to do. Unsure if she has friends or how the hell she is getting home. Her face came towards me at one point, and I dodged it. Wasn’t about to have people accusing me of taking advantage of this girl. After like half a song she says she’s feeling sick and needs to sit down, and I’m rushing to get her back to the table. I was not puked on and found somewhere else to sit (later she had a couple girls that seemed to know her, she was safe).",

She then politely put her hand on my leg and looked at me and offered out of the blue that I could have sex with her and she will carry the baby for us until born. She was very confident that she would get pregnant easily and would mind if we tried a few times before getting success. She asked that if we did it, that I tell her husband the process would be invitro but she thinks we would have a better chance doing it the normal way. I told her I was flattered about the offer but would rather not want to talk about it again. She also made the offer to my wife a few days later but doing a surrogate invetero way. Luckly sge did not mention having sex with me to my wife. She tried a few times to put her hand on my leg and shoulder again but luckily for me she left the company without me needing to fire her. I see her sometimes at church and she acts like everything is normal. \n\nAnother employee once kissed me infront of my wife on camera. It was at a work function celebrating her promotion, and she asked if we could take a picture together. She asked my wife to take a photo of her and me, with my wifes phone. While posing for the photo she nealt over and kissed me on the mouth. Not a peck kiss,  a proper kiss with her hands around my neck and leg popped up in the air.

Since I was the person who had basically built the place, everyone considered it mine. So my ex’s intent was clearly pointed at getting my attention. \n\nHer goal was to finish the place in secret and surprise me with her amazing skills and determination. Of course, no one knew that she was there. This would have been the fall of 1986 and I had started dating my now wife. As soon as she heard about this vacation cabin, she wanted to see it. \n\nSo one random weekend, we drove up. I was excited to show her my hard work over the last 5 or more years. We park and make our way to the front door. As soon as I open it, the waft of perfume and cooking hit us. I walk in to find rolling racks of clothes, piles of books, paperwork, a phone on the wall, trinkets, pictures and every other tell-tale sign of someone living there that you could imagine. \n\nMy soon-to-be wife looks around and can tell instantly that whoever is living here is female. She looks at me and sees the same look of shock that she was sporting and realized that I had no idea. I did some quick detective work and called a few people that I knew in the area. One of them was able to get in touch with my ex and I was finally able to speak to her - on the phone that she had installed. I was calm and controlled. I told her that she needed to get out to the cabin and take everything out. I said that we’d leave and be gone for a few hours. \n\nWhen we came back about 3 hours later, everything was gone. It wasn’t until a year or more later that I finally learned why she had done it. I think that’s pretty aggressive.",

I turn and walk away from them and she proceeds to wrap her arms around my waist as I continue to walk away and I end up dragging her across the dance floor. I arrive to where my ex and her friend are standing and give her the glass of wine. This woman continues to beg me to take her home and fuck her. Mind you, now in front of my fiancé.\n\nI politely tell her no and recommend that she leaves and goes home. This is when she starts seeing red and freaks out. Calling ME the asshole for not fucking her. She keeps insulting me and my manhood and how I missed out on fucking two hot girls. I loose my cool and call her a bitch and tell her to get away from me. Then my ex and her friend get pissed at me and tell me I’m being inappropriate. WTF. This bitch has her arms wrapped around me screaming that I need to fuck her and I’m being inappropriate???

Obviously, this wasn’t a great setup and she eventually broke up with me. We both moved on, but She never understood how much I dislike birthdays. \n\nFast forward 2 years and we’ve broken up. I’ve already let her know that I try not to reach out to or meet my exes while I’m dating someone (just a rule I live by). She wishes me happy birthday, I delete her number (I’ve already let her know not to contact me). Next year, she wishes me happy birthday and I block her number. Next year, she used a friends phone to text me happy birthday. So for 3 years she’s using one of my least favorite things as an excuse to stay in contact with me(?) and bringing back the old bad memories of the relationship, probably without knowing how much it stressed me out 😂. \n\nI think she got the message since I haven’t gotten a text in 2 years.

This girl had been kind of aggressively flirting with me since I got there. Her boyfriend fell asleep while we were on all the couch, and she was under a blanket in between us. She then started slightly moving her body in a consistent motion along with the random slightest sound of a wet* pussy. \n I was so shocked I was too stunned to say or do anything out of fear of awkwardness or even getting into a fight with her boyfriend. I can't say 100% for sure if she was because she was under the blanket, but I'm like 98% sure she was.",

My seat is by the pencil sharpener do some people come by from time to time. (Context: I go to a catholic school) this redhead girl who was my cheerleader for football walked by to sharpen her pencil. She dropped her pencil and when she bent over to grab she bent at only the waist. As she bent over her naked pussy and ass revealed themselves to me. We fucked in the locker room after the game that day. While she was riding me her sister was sucking my balls… shit was great.",
