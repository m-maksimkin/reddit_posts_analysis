Then I push her on the shoulder and yell \"oh great! I knew YOU'D SHOW UP!\". And she'd be confused but then I'd wink and she'd get it and yell back \" well you didn't think I'd just let you walk around here, after that thing you did!\" And she'd give me a little push. And I'd yell back \"yeah well I didn't appreciate how you made me feel when you said that thing in front of those people\" and I'd be in the angry stance, really selling it because I was in a play in highschool once. And the follower would come shambling out of the shadows, unconsciously drawn forward by the spectacle. Slowly coming closer thinking \"I know I'm the bad guy but these two look at them maybe I should intervene, cuz they're making a scene and that looks kinda serious...\" And he's an uncomfortable spectator. And as he gets to almost arms reach as we go back n forth I pause in my yelling and give her a nod like it's almost the moment but I add in the little eyebrows raise move because you know, timings a thing here. And she'd be confused but then she'd do a little glance over and get it and gives me back the slightest nod of comprehension, but with the ever so slight crook of a smile in one corner of her mouth. And just then the follower decides to step forward to intervene saying \"hey you guys, I think...\" With his hand coming up with that finger pose you do when you'd like to politely interrupt a debate to make a cogent point on the topic but just then I spin and BAMMO vicious left hook right to the chin, which connects because I'm a south paw anyway so it's ok and at the same moment she swings  with her right and BOFFO right on the chin too. And down he goes backward flat but with his arms up in a Y like they do. and then there's that moment of silence and then she breaks it by exclaiming \"YEAH!\" And does a little hop and fist pump into the air. And I'm there doing the foot to foot shuffle with my hands on my hip like whew I didn't know that would work but I'm glad it did.

Next thing I know, this big lump of a guy approaches and tries talking to her and she is just so uncomfortable, so I put my arm around her and pulled her a bit closer and asked how the guy was doing. He said \"I'm not talking to you I'm talking to her\" without breaking eye contact with the girl. I said \"well I'm talking to you, so what's up?\" Dude got a bit testy and squared up to me, but when the friends I was with stood at my side and pushed the guy back, he left.\n\nWe decided we would walk the girl home and lo and behold, when we got outside the club, that guy had just been standing, waiting. I made it clear we had seen him and he started running away.\n\nWe walked her all the way home, and it turned out this guy was on her course and had made a habit of being a creep on all nights out. Didn't matter where she went out, who she was with or what their plans were, he was everywhere she went. Hope she found a way to keep him at distance, but I never saw her again.\n\nEDIT: This blew up a bit. Let me clarify: by never saw her again, I mean I had never seen her before the incident and we never actively noticed eachother after. There is every chance we passed eachother by numerous times, I may have even queued behind her in a shop, I have no idea. I can confirm that there was no news of student murders in my university city.

Damn, it's been a minute, how you been?\" I don't know the guy, but his eyes dart over at this fat woman covered in bruises and clearly high on something. The guy is pretty small, probably less than half the woman's weight. He comes out from behind the counter and keeps talking to me like we're old buddies. He keeps getting closer and closer to me, then leans in and whispers, \"Don't leave.\" So I chill and talk to the guy for a little bit. His name is Dustin. Turns out we actually have a friend in common.\n\nThe woman is still trying even though I'm there. She says she just came from a party and fucked a bunch of guys, that it wouldn't be a big deal if Dustin fucks her too. She goes on to say she was going to fuck a horse in front of the guys at the party but no one had a horse for her to fuck. Dustin and I just freeze, unsure if we're heard her correctly, blankly staring at each other. She asks Dustin if he thinks it would be hot. If he would watch. Yep, she said it. This goes on for about 10 minutes before police finally arrive to escort the woman out.\n\nDustin tells me the woman tried to push him into the bathroom, that he had to grab into the door frame and fight his way out. He tried called the police but she kept chasing him around the store grabbing at him. He wasn't sure if the police dispatcher was taking his call seriously and was worried they wouldn't send anyone. That's when I walked in.\n\nAnyways, I run into Dustin again about two years ago in a store. He is with his girlfriend. He just starts busting out laughing when he sees me, turns to his girlfriend and says, \"This guy can tell you that horse girl was real\".",

About 15 seconds later the cops show up(took them about 3 minutes). I told one what happened while one followed the bloody trail on foot and the other took off in his cruiser. They found him, brought him back for an ID and he got arrested for so so many things, they told her and me that since she was 15 he'd be getting the book thrown at him. Before they left, one of the cops told me \"next time you discharge you weapon, save us the effort and aim for the head.\" Felt kinda racist tbh, and I was already upset, so I boarded the broken window and just left the rest of the work for the morning, and my boss was upset at me.",

So he throws the car in park starts to open his door and the Asian woman is already at the passenger side pulling on the handle, my husband jumps back in the car narrowly avoiding this attacker and they pull off. He asked where she needed to go or if he could call someone for her. And she broke down crying explaining she was walking her dog and the attacker started shouting shit about COVID and all types of Asian slurs and she ended up running away from this woman 15+ blocks cuz she didn’t wanna lead her to her apartment. My husband drove her to a busy intersection where her boyfriend picked her up. The whole ordeal took less than an hour.

She was waiting for her job interview session to start and killing time by the cable car turn around. \n\nI was a few blocks away doing my own errands for the day. We were texting because her interview was for the company I work for and I knew some of the people running it. \n\nSo I was giving her tips, encouragement, etc as we texted back and forth. And then she suddenly asks me where I am.\n\nTold her I was a few blocks away at the Metreon and she asked me if I could quickly meet her where she was hanging out. I thought that was a bit odd at first but her follow up text informed me that there was a guy being creepy and not leaving her alone. \n\nReplied letting her know I’d be right there and quickly made my way the few blocks down to the cable car turnaround. Took me a few minutes but I jogged most of the way. \n\nI round the corner, looking around for where she told me she was lingering and there she was. She’d move a little and the guy she had mentioned closed the distance and stuck way too close to her. \n\nSo I took in a deep breath. Heart was beating a bit fast since I’ve never been in a situation like this before. Didn’t know how the guy would react and I hate confrontations. I’ll stand my ground if needed but they make me feel uneasy afterwards. \n\nPut in a smile, called out to her as I was walking up which grabbed both their attention. Moved up to her, put my hand around her waist and leaned in to give her a kiss on the cheek. Apologized for making her wait and acted the part of her boyfriend. Then looked at the guy still a little too close and asked the question of who he was. \n\nGuy clearly seemed confused. Or maybe disappointed? He wasn’t pleased, that’s for sure. My friend made a comment of a stranger she was chatting with. I said cool and asked her if we wanted to get going and motioned down the street. \n\nShe said sure. I gave the guy a wave and said bye and off we went. Walked a block or so towards the hotel my company was renting a conference room for the interview sessions and then pulled my arm back and gave her space. \n\nShe said thanks and vented about the whole experience the remainder of the walk to the interview location before I saw her off.",

When she gets closer I hear her say please act like you’re my boyfriend and goes in to hug me. I immediately put my arms around her and stared at the corner she came from. 2 of the guys rounded and looked at me. I could tell they were deciding their move as I continued to stare. I almost always carry a weapon on me but fortunately they quieted down and walk away. By this time she had her cheek against mine and I could tell if I turned my head she was going to kiss me.. great right? So I pulled my head back and looked to my left to see my girlfriend had just pulled up on the opposite side of the street and had the window rolled down 😅 I asked the girl if she was okay and she said yes reluctantly so I pointed to the car and said that’s my girlfriend and she can wait with us if she doesn’t feel safe. She declined after I verified 3 more times. This was the first time I’d been in a situation like this. It was pretty crazy to go from being groggy and sleeping 10 minutes prior to fully aware and ready.

She tells me she's in trouble and needs me to help walk her to a nearby hotel (1-2km, about a mile in freedom distance) to make sure she gets there safe\n\nI immediately have alarm bells going off, since theres an entire cafe full of people and she runs over to the first person she sees alone. I tell her to sit with me, and I'll phone a friend who lives nearby to come and pick us up and drive us there.\n\nShe REFUSES, and INSISTS I walk her there myself. At night. Alone.\n\nI tell her I don't feel safe doing that, but I would be more than willing to try and get a ride for her with my friend or even a cop.\n\nSuddenly, the \"scared\" look drops. She gets pissed off and actually yells at me for \"not helping her out\" then stomps out of the door of the cafe into the night. Confidently. She asked no one else for help, just the one chick who was sitting alone in the cafe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSooo yeah, while  you should always be willing to help someone out, do NOT ignore alarm bells and don't put yourself in a position where you can end up getting attacked. Just by the way her \"scared\" look turned to absolute rage at my insistance on doing things safely, it seems pretty clear something would've happened to me if I went along with her",

While Im walking up to the bar this medic from my unit makes eye contact, she has a concerned look on her face while standing with a couple fellas. Anyone with eyes could tell they were soldiers as well but I didnt know them, I gave her a subtle confused look back but with a smile. Next thing I know, shes giving me a neckhug and tells me she dont feel right, maybe got roofied. So I take her back to the pool table I was at, told my bro what was up and we take a cab back to post. Not 30 minutes later she is indeed drugged, poor girl. I carried her to my barracks room, put her in my bed and let her sleep it off. I slept in the floor. I didnt know which barracks she lived in and to save her more headache than necessary from command, we kept it to ourselves. We have been close friends ever since. This was in 2005. \n\nUnfortunately, sexual assault happens a lot in the military. More male on male than youd think. Like the time a dude suspected his roommate of drugging and raping him, he kept quiet for the longest time out of fear no one would believe him. It wasnt until he failed a UA that it came to light and the rapist POS got the hammer brought down on him. First thing that POS said was he demanded protection by being moved to jail. Smart, because we was gonna teach the rapist a lesson. \n\nI always felt bad for women in uniform as they are outnumbered by men. Dont know the exact details but from what I could see it was like 3 to 1 at least.",

Fortunately my car was faster than the small truck. I raced ahead, slammed on the brakes and loaded my gun, took off again, just as I saw them coming. As I approached the store, there was a large lot next to it and I cut through it. A cop happened to drive by then, but since I was off to the side, he didn't see me waving. I saw a bunch of bikers off to the other side of the store lot, taking a break. Thank God! I actually felt safer with the bikers. I'm old (why were these 2 young jerks following?) and have known many bikers. I drove right up to them. By the time I told them, here comes the guys. I pointed them out. Two of the bikers stood up laughing & headed for the truck. No doubt knowing they'd terrorize the idiots. Boy, they took off in a big hurry. In the direction they came from. The 'saviors' (at least a dozen) then told me where they were heading, same as myself. They're like, \"we're right behind you\". \n\nLove those old bikers!",

The young white girl, in her early teens, ran across the road in front of us, forcing the car to stop, she came round the passenger side and pulled the door open, and threw her body in the car. She was screaming for help.\n\nA few seconds later, a gang of young teens came trying to pull her away, so I put my body in the way, and told her to get in the car. There were a mix of guys and girls and they were getting violent. Then an older man came over to us demanding we let her go, making it look like we were kidnapping her and he started become aggressive. I told him, I won’t let her go till the police came.. He said he was the girls' social worker so I asked him to pull out his ID, which he did. I didn’t know what step take, because she looked scared of them all, so I got back in the car, and spoke to the young girl, asked he if she knew him, and told her if she wasn’t comfortable, we could call the police and wait for them to come… She confirmed she knew him, so I let her go with him, since her body language shows she calmed down a lot.\n\nI called the police station later and left a report, but the police didn’t get back to me. Doesn’t seem as dramatic, but it something I vividly remember because of the place and time it happened, and something like that doesn’t happen to people like me because I look more scary than I am.",

It was very unclear what was going through his mind. He must have followed while not quite knowing if it was okay, or he was interested in one of the women and thought she was too. But she sure as hell wasn’t, cause she came up to me and locked arms with me. And she said that the man is making her uncomfortable. As soon as we locked arms he backed off a few meters. After a few minutes I asked him nicely to stay away, cause you’re making my friend uncomfortable. I was met with complete confusion. But after that my friend helped me out and sternly told him to leave. After which he did. That’s my story, I felt a little bad for him cause he seemed decent.

            "text": "So, I was solo backpacking Europe in my early 20’s and ended up meeting my two friends in Venice, Italy. The couch surfer I stayed with the night before bailed on me that evening and my friends told me it was no problem, I could sneak in to their hotel with them. So, we stayed out late, had a huge pasta dish and loads of wine without a worry. Big Fucking mistake. The concierge called us on the reservation limit as soon as we stepped in the teeny hotel. He was fuming. I speak standard Italian so I told him I was just grabbing my bag and leaving, and I assured my friends I’d be fine and just walk along the canal until sunrise. It was already about 3:30AM, I couldn’t imagine it being that bad. \n\nSo, here I am walking around the labyrinth of Venice in the middle of the night. It wasn’t so scary, but it was remarkably quiet compared to the traffic during the day. After some time, I was shocked at how empty it was, really. I noticed my phone was out of data and almost dead. No good. Then, I took a wrong turn somewhere and found myself in an alley with a drunk man. I recognized him from earlier in the day. He had been harassing passersby in San Marco square. It’s a pretty small island, so I wasn’t too surprised to recognize him. I immediately tried to scurry off. Unfortunately, this shmuck noticed me and began to stumble after me shouting profane threats for the next 30-40 minutes. I was peeling through those alleys with him in tow, and no one was in sight! \n\nJust when I reached a point of absolute panic, I saw two men around my age wearing aprons and sharing some pizza by the main canal. I ran over to them and loudly shouted the bit of dialect I picked up, saying, “Hey! I’ve been looking for you two!” \n\nAt first, they looked absolutely stumped. It took them all of two seconds to put together the drunk, sweaty man jogging after me and the terrified look on my face. They immediately started screaming at the man to leave and not come back. I explained the situation and they reprimanded me for walking around Venice alone at night, but they were more protective and afraid for me than anything else. Afterwards, they brainstormed how they’d like to stay awake with me or if I’d be comfortable sleeping on their couch. We sat and chatted for a while. \n\nAfterwards, I ended up running into my couch surfer’s friend that I had met the day prior and he let me stay at his place which was… and entirely different and ridiculous story on its own. \n\nAny-who, that is a wild story that I tend not to tell because it is so ridiculously dramatic. But I’m endlessly happy I found those two sweet men eating pizza. Don’t know what would have happened had they not been on a late shift and decided to sit by the canal.",

This guy had been following her for a few minutes and whenever she turned her head, he just stood there casually wanking out to her in the open. Then, to my surprise she held my arm and kissed me, perhaps to pretend I was her BF. I got up, picked up a stick in my hand and chased the guy while abusing him (I was lean and muscular back then). Then I went back to the bench and told her it's ok and that she's safe. She started crying and hugged me tightly. I hugged her back all the while telling her \"aaall is well\" (it's a classic line from a Bollywood movie) to lighten the mood and it worked as she started smiling and laughing.

If memory serves, one of my friends knew one of the hosts. It was your standard kegger/mixer jointly put on by a sorority and fraternity. I was a senior at the time. One of the people in the car with us was a freshman girl, who before that night, I didn’t know. I was a fairly big guy since I spent my off hours in the gym, and this was an ugly sweater Christmas party, so, I could really hold my liquor and I was looking bulkier than usual that night. \n\nThis girl was easily one of one of the most attractive women at the party. When she walked by, all the men would turn their heads and watch, only to resume their conversations when she was out of sight. To put it mildly, the freshman girl (in a tiny miniskirt and a tube top) was plied with beers all night by drunk frat boys until she was constantly accosted in the hallways whenever she passed them. I even caught one of them—who cornered here by a relatively deserted stairwell—pinning her against the wall and tonguing her face and her neck. She was alarmed, and it showed on her face (she shot me a look which may as well have been the universal sign for help) but, I gathered she was afraid to physically resist, apart from trying to display an obvious revulsion. On this particular occasion, I tapped the guy on the shoulder and told him to back off, and luckily, I didn’t have to escalate things any further than that. \n\nFor the rest of the night, I played bouncer around all these grabby dudes who kept reaching for her erogenous areas. I hadn’t intended to do this from the go, but at one point I realized—when I went outside to take a leak—she was standing next to me and afraid to be alone at the party. To give you some idea of how afraid she was, there was frozen snow on the ground around us (it was probably in the low 20s F), and she was scantily clad, yet she’d have rather stood out there than in the party. Basically I spent the night drinking and telling other guys “she’s with me, so keep your hands to yourself.” \n\nAt one point during the night, some men in my party would find me and tell me “dude, that girl’s gonna get raped.” No one else stepped up or put themselves on the line. Needless, to say, I stopped going out with these guys after this night’s events. I never heard from this girl again, and I never knew more than her first name. I hope she learned how to look after herself after that.",

I gut laughed seeing Wile E. Coyote in full Mad Max Fury Road gear chasing the Roadrunner.\n\nAnd it's lowkey a huge troll against Netflix algorithm movies, and the Marvel Avengers movies.

One of them had a knife in hand. I called out to them to fuck off since I was armed. They chose not to respond, but moved in closer. I opened fire and immediately hit two. At this time the woman exclaimed that I had shot her boyfriend. She wasn’t a victim trying to escape these men. She was the bait. She was also armed and it didn’t help their situation.

There was an odd guy alone at the bar who approached us for a chat but we found him annoying as hell so brushed him off. He just had a creepy vibe and I really just wanted to see my mate not make new ones. We were probably pretty rude in how we dealt with him but like I say he just seemed very odd.\n\nAbout an hour later a woman comes up to us and says there's a creepy guy bothering her and her friend and could we pretend to be her friends. We obviously realised it was the creepy guy from before and I pretended to be a friend she hasn't seen for a while.

I asked her why she needed someone to walk her and she said some homeless people near her place always made her nervous and I guess I guy who came on to her pretty hard once also lived in the same apartment complex.\n\nAnyway, we walked to her place, she sat me on the couch handed me the rabbit who I just hung out with for like half an hour while she showered and got dressed.\n\nAt one point her roommate came out to do the dishes, didn’t know who I was and it seemed like it scared the shit out of her for a second until I explained I was her roommates coworker and had walked her home.\n\nAnyway, after she was ready we headed back to the party and that was the end of it, though I kinda got the vibe she might have had a bit of a crush on me afterwards. Mostly because she’d constantly tell people I was so sweet and kind while in ear shot, which was kinda bewildering to me, since I’ve always been a bit of a loser and have never even tried to flirt or anything in college.\n\nHer friends thought I was a creep though and seemed like they went out of their way to keep us separated during parties, mostly because she had a horrible habit of getting absolutely plastered.\n\nBut anyway, I did the same for a lot of other girls in college.

I had heard of this kind of stalking before but had downplayed it in my mind because I just couldn't imagine anyone in modern society doing this kind of thing. About six or seven years ago, I was meeting my friend, a girl, for a screening of The Room at the local arthouse theater. The theater was walkable distance for both of us so she walked to the theater to meet me there. She came into the theater and walked over to me and said, \"there's a guy who's been following me for several blocks, and he followed me into the theater--he walked past the box office ticket-taker.\" And I was kinda like ??? and looked up and saw this beefy guy walk into the theater's lobby, with this intense look on his face, and when he saw us together he stopped. My memory at this point is a bit fuzzy because mostly my mind was blown that this kind of thing happens, but I remember giving my friend a hug or talking to her or something like that, with the intention of making it known to that dude that she wasn't alone in the theater. The guy stared at us, then turned around and walked out. One of the biggest WTF moments, as a guy. Public stalking happens all the time.",

He was walking through the mall and he said some big guy was following him. He told me he was talking to himself and saying things like “cute boy, I want you cute boy”. I tried to stay calm. My brother started crying, he said he was speed walking to get away and no one was around. I then heard the guy behind him, cuz he started talking louder. I told my brother to run to the nearest store and go to a worker. He booked it and ran towards the Macy’s. He said the guy sped up. I told him to run and tried to make him feel as ok as I could. Thankfully he ran to a counter and grabbed a worker. Who called security. I stayed on the phone until they came. When I got off the phone I cried. My brother is so sweet and I felt so useless and scared the whole time. I’m so glad he was ok. But the incident gave him some horrible anxiety. People are just so creepy and awful.",

Instantly on guard cuz that's damn late to go pitching The Good Word, ya know? Well, it's a teenage girl all by herself. I think she would regularly takes walks around the neighborhood at night. It was a nice neighborhood and my gf at the time would do the same both where she lived and when she was over, so I rolled with it. She says a car was following her. Stayed close without getting up next to her, but matched speed and followed all her turns. She asked me to walk her home. My only thought was \"shoes, keys... do I need anything else?\"\n\nI did tell her I could drive her if she wanted to get home sooner, but it was entirely her call. I believe in the power of options. She wanted to stick to walking, so I locked my door and we got walking. Pretty nice little chat on the way; mostly over a shared interest in anime. She played basketball on her school team, so definitely a youngin'.\n\nGot to the end of her street and she asked if I mind heading back so I don't learn which house is hers. Obviously, I'm cool with it. I know my intentions and would've happily waited until she went through a door, but I don't need to go the extra mile if it's not what makes her feel safest. Wished her a good night and headed home. Didn't see any cars on the way back.\n\nSo to answer the question, I'd do what I can to help. Try to accommodate her safety and comfort all I can. Try to keep an eye out for any nefarious types, keeping the other eye out for anyone else who can help or do a better job than me (like her parents, or a woman if she felt safer than with a male stranger).",

The same barista went out to look for him, and feeling uncomfortable that we didn't know where he was - the other barista used her free Uber credit to get me a ride home just in case. I will never forget what they did for me! There were no questions asked, they jumped straight into action. I don't know what they might have saved me from, but I'm thankful all the time.

Pretty much right by the Potomac. In the early 2000s there was construction on the river side of the street. To be honest, even as a young soldier I still felt it was a bit sketchy but it was WAY easier to park down there and you were far less likely to get towed. I would park by the construction fences because there was no clear parking signage. Well any way I parked my car there and was walking to the theater to meet up with some folks and passed by a couple of guys that I didn’t really think much about. They seemed preoccupied with their conversation which I couldn’t understand. Maybe 25 meters or so later INSIDE the construction fencing there was a young female, under 40 for sure. She was just sitting still kinda facing the river in the dark. WTF is this person doing in here by themselves?! Some of you know that DC is not the safest place to be after dark, especially alone. I turned and literally asked “what the hell are you doing?” To be honest it creeped me the fuck out. This startled her, she kinda yelled a little and turned toward me. She asked me if I was alone! I immediately thought I was about to get jumped. I said yes like an idiot. Her next question may have been one of the most intelligent I have ever heard in a stressful environment. She asked me if I lived there. I responded by saying I lived on FT Myer but was from Oklahoma. She said “great” and immediately walked to the the fencing and started to squeeze through the fence gate. She asked me if she could go to the movies with me. I said yes and we started walking. She clutched my arm hard enough my fingers were tingling by the time we got there. Not even 200 meters later we walked in. There was an officer in the theater entrance and she let go of my arm and went to him. Not a word to me at that point. I still to this day don’t know what was truly going on there. I feel like it’s something along these lines. I hope she is ok if that’s the case and she doesn’t ever do anything like that again. Going in to a construction area while being followed?!

I had completely forgotten about it until this thread. \r  \n\r  \n I live in a party college town, I was downtown pretty late one night leaving an event.  The downtown bar scene is always packed, with wall-to-wall drunken students. A young college student came up behind me grabbed my arm and she was clearly panicked, and in a rush of words she said: \"I think I'm being followed I need your help please please please don't freak out but I need you to put your arm around me like you know me.\"  she looked absolutely terrified. It took me a few seconds to process what she was saying. my heart just started beating like it was going to pop out of my chest and I'm suddenly hyper-aware of my surroundings. for a moment a look of horror crossed her face like I was going to freak out at her. \r  \n\r  \nI put on my best 'missing an old friend voice'  \"HEEEEEEYYY! IT'S SOO GOOD TO SEE YOU!\" I gave her a hug and whispered \"Tell me where you want me to take you.\"  She broke down into tears she couldn't speak she was choking back relief and fear. \"Alright let's just walk for now.\" I just started rambling on about work and kids and the car I just bought and I'm physically shaking like an old woman who's had a way too much coffee to drink. every minute or so I'd take a really deep breath to try and keep the shaking at bay because I was expecting to get jumped and knifed. \r  \n\r  \nWe walked for what felt like an eternity. When she regained her ability to breathe she told me that earlier in the evening her phone had gone missing. She was at the bar and she was on it but put it down to greet someone else she knew and when she turned back around what she thought was only a few seconds later it was gone. She was pretty sure that the man who's stalking her took her phone. she'd been getting harassing sexual phone calls and she has felt like she'd been watched all day.  she had no way to get ahold of anyone she didn't have anyone's numbers memorized. she was a new student from out of town and got lost easily. she was more comfortable walking back to the dorms but she wasn't sure where it was. I Kind of had an idea of where the campus was, I figured if I could get her back to the area where she was familiar I could get her home. about halfway there she ran into someone else she knew and she left with them. \r  \n\r  \nshe gave me a hug, thanked me and left. \r  \n\r  \nNo idea what happened to her, I hope she's okay.",

            "text": "Sort of a similar scenario happened to me in college. We had a bagel shop on campus, and I stopped in to grab a sandwich for dinner on my way to work (I loaded trucks for UPS at night). It was just me and the girl behind the counter, and right when she handed me my bag a group of really drunk and obnoxious guys walked in. She quietly asked me not to leave, so I just sat down at a table with my bag. They were just kind of being obnoxious and immature for a few minutes, nothing threatening or worrisome, until the leader of the pack went behind the counter and cornered the girl. I stood up (I’m a big guy, not aggressive or a fighter by any means, but definitely a lot bigger than any of the guys acting stupid) and said “that’s enough guys, time to leave.” The aggression immediately turned towards me from all four of them, running their mouths, so I simply said “enough talk, let’s step outside.” I stepped towards the door and they all followed. Three of them stood back apparently content to run their mouths from a distance, but the ringleader wanted to get into my face. I didn’t escalate, but made sure that the shouting match caused enough of a commotion that people were starting to watch. Someone apparently called campus police, and they showed up really quickly before anything really happened. The guys tried to kind of scurry away, but the cops rounded them up and detained all of us to sort it out. The girl from the bagel shop came out and explained that the guys had been coming in drunk every day for a week or so, getting increasingly aggressive, but nobody had been around and she hadn’t really known what to do because it hadn’t really gotten too out of hand (apparently they hadn’t tried to come behind the counter until that day, but they had been getting bolder each time they came by). I stopped in a week or so later to grab dinner, and the girl thanked me and told me that they were all students, so they all got out on probation for their conduct which would lead to expulsion if anything else happened. I feel like the common thread amongst all of these stories is that (a) this kind of thing seems to happen all too often and (b) nobody ever expects something like this to happen.

Because there was no space to sit, I gave up my seat and stood beside her. After few mins I looked over her shoulder to see her texting a friend about a guy stalking her and that she was terrified. A station later, the seat next to her freed up. I sat down next to her and struck up a conversation. \nI told her I read what she sent to her friend and asked her if the guy was on the train. She said yes. So I called my friends and told them to go to the station she gets off at and talk to a police officer and explain the situation to the officer. I explained the plan to her and I told her to not worry and I left for another compartment. I got off st the station she gets off at and stayed back maybe 50 mts and sure enough, this dude traced her every footstep. \nShe went to the place where they punch the metro card and punched herself out and around the corner was a cop along with a station worker. They asked her to identify the guy and she did and he tried taking off but they kinda had security on all the exits so he was caught pretty fast.
