But I don't think sneakers are a good way to do that (I'm not saying buy cheap sneakers if you like or need them for any reason, by all means get decent quality ones, but I think you're better off getting spendy on other types of shoes.)\n\nFirst of all, and this is just my personal taste, I don't think they look good, and often I think the more expensive ones are way uglier than cheaper ones. \n\nAnd they age like shit. Other shoes kind of age and get a worn-in look that I personally like, sneakers just look gross after a while. And you can keep a pair of leather shoes looking decent with some saddle soap and polish for quite a while, and even get some of them resoled putting them almost into buy-in-for-life territory, not too much you can do to extend the life of a pair of sneakers. I can usually get at least a couple years out of any other pair of shoes (I rotate through them so I'm not usually wearing the same shoes days on end. With some exceptions I don't buy into the \"shoes need to breathe and dry out between uses\" that reddit loves to go on about, but it's simple math, if you're dividing your time between X pairs of shoes, they'll last roughly X times as long. Still, my sneakers always start looking kind of beat up after a few months, and never seem to last more than a year at most before they're litterally falling apart on me.\n\nI also don't find them particularly comfortable, again, personal taste there.\n\nAlso all of the plastic and rubber is kind of an environmental nightmare. Not that other shoes  don't have plenty of plastic/rubber components, but every bit counts.",

Make sure to feed yourself good information that is thoroughly researched in all aspects of your life and you’ll genuinely live a much better life.\n\nAlso, can’t wait for [nanobots](https://youtu.be/ZGGDKC3GlrI).
