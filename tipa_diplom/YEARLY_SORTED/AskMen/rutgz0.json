What you are going to have to do is to have an awkward/difficult conversation about it, and figure it out from there.  If you are going to make a relationship work, you're going to have quite a few of these.  And do them gently because inevitably you'll be on the receiving end of an awkward/difficult conversation.  Relationships take work, and the guys telling you to split over what might literally be a joke is a sign of a lack of experience or maturity.  Maybe this is the start of a breakup, but not until you talk and figure out what's going on.\n\nGood luck, bro.",

As a female, who doesn't dream of proposing to a man, I'd probably begin to feel resentful and hurt. It's a very sensitive topic to bring up and talk about, even for a female. It's not her fault or your fault, it's a safe communication place issue between the two of you. This is just my guess as to why she'd probably call you that rather than bf...it begins to feel embarassing saying you have a bf and then followed by questions about how long youre together and then facial expressions change, people ask why you're not married and you literally feel embarrassed, like something is wrong with you that he didn't put a ring on it. It's easier to just say something that warrants fewer questions and embarrassment. If this is the issue, please be sensitive.

Not to be silly but we are \"FB official\" and he's tagged in my social media a lot. \n\nI did have a phase when we hit the 5 year mark when I was upset that he hadn't proposed as I had made it clear that at the time I wanted obvious commitment and to be married. (now were 9 years in and i'm fine with being engaged for life)  I told him I felt like he was treating me like a roommate rather than a partner... I think thats where I picked it up from. Either way. Just talk to her.  Are you sure she isn't saying it with her female friends too and your only noticing it with the males?  She might just be acting passive aggressive for a million reasons. \n\nHonestly, go buy a bottle of wine, let both of you have a glass to loosen up and then have a conversation. It could be nothing, maybe she's being passive aggressive, and be open to what she has to say if she has feelings about how you might be treating her and not be aware that its making her upset. Just talk.",
