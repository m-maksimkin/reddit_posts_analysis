Never commit the mistake of thinking your boss likes you above the good service you provide, you are replacable and he's just probably trying to downgrade the paycheck you should be receiving by being nice and making you think the company's problems are your problems as well, they aren't.\n\n2. Be aware of what you say. If you have a problem if someone finds out, never say it, to no one.\n\n3. Get a grip to how your supervisor is like. If he defends the department when you fuck up or if he throws you under the train to save his ass. Act accordingly.\n\n4. Relationships with co-workers often end up with one having to leave the company or having a hard time working there, avoid it unless you're entirely sure it worths it.\n\n5. It's sad but true, having tegridy, a spine in other words don't make you climb positions, it's often the other way around, that's because bosses think they can't control you into doing what they want to, like making decisions that fucks the entire department or an individual person they don't like, that's why they tend to pick asslickers, they say fetch and they fetch, bunch of good dogs. If you want to be a asslicker beware of what that implies, doing ehat you're told with a fucking smile in your face.\n\n6.

Most of this negative commentary is likely coming from people that worked at large corporations. Smaller ones tend to have less politics, more trust, and more consideration of employees as humans rather than objects.\n\n2. Pay attention to your desk set up ergonomics and pay for good equipment out of your own pocket if need be. Day by day it’s no big deal but over the years bad posture can ruin your physical health. \n\n3. Rather than looking for the perfect company or position, look for the perfect mentor to work under. The right mentor will make you grow exponentially faster than the right role or company.\n\n4. Work towards tying your compensation to the revenue generated by the company (or another growth metric). When most people hear this they think of sales but it is definitely possible in other areas. This is the trick to making a lot more money than you might otherwise.\n\n5. Before you get into a management position, do some deep introspection and test runs of managing other people. Many people struggle once they’ve been promoted to management and then they suddenly realize that most of their work is managing other people and not doing the actual “work” that they used to.\n\n6. Make sure the company has good leaders. There are exceptions to this, but the general rule is that the behaviors, ethics, and competence of people at the top emanate downwards to everyone else.\n\n7.

            "text": "Two core points: 1) Look to upgrade your role and company as much as you can by looking externally. 2) Attitude will get you far when starting out, even if your work isn’t on point. \n\nRegarding point one: I work in an office environment, and have since I was 22 (almost ten years now). I love it now, but I didn’t always. I worked for three years out of college in an environment I disliked (the company culture just wasn’t great), but I focused on improving my situation by looking for relevant opportunities externally. Although I was promoted three times in this company, I was constantly looking for and applying to roles at top tier tech companies. My interviews and applications failed a lot, but I was able to finally land a job at a FAANG company doing marketing, and 3X’d my income. I know people who still work at my old firm, still make $50K because they don’t make the effort to look externally and practice interviewing. \n\nRegarding point two: no matter if your work sucks or is great, be coachable, look to improve your work, and help your manager. I had major issues with attention to detail for a long time, but people would often give me a break because I was willing to learn and improve (now I don’t have those issues, my work is excellent). \n\nOne bonus point: I disliked being in an office in general - especially for what I was getting paid. I almost quit to go farm multiple times in my first three years. But it gets better when you start getting paid more (and you will if you pay attention to my first two points), and as you become used to the environment. It’s not a natural place to be, but you get used to it. \n\nAnother bonus point: after each successful project immediately integrate it into your resume. If you don’t you will not be able to nimbly apply to better roles with your resume always ready and up to date, and you may just forget what you did. \n\nHope this all makes sense and there aren’t too many typos, currently writing this out on my phone. Good luck :)",

Develop your dependency at the organisation. Something that you are solely responsible for if possible. Something that you do and you do good. Unless it's really excruciating circumstances you will always be required by the company for the set of things you handle meticulously.\n\n3. Try and not have a VERY GOOD relationship (like a friendship) with your manager. Just good. Proper formal. Neither too close nor too detached . Because if you start having a good friendship even tho you guys genuinely click and you are not just clearly sucking up to him, in the current job dynamic I have seen even if you do an amazing job he will have to try and give you a neutral/semi decent review so as to not be called out in the office water cooler talks or if an employee is feisty , to the HR for favouring someone who has great relations with him. \n\n4. A SAME RACE BOSS IS NEVER GOOD NEWS. I dont know about white/Caucasians/african-americans....but in the asian community be it any Asian....I have seen a boss of the same race spells more trouble than a benefit for you. You think you can connect on the plethora of common points and have a good rapport. But they generally tend to go out of the line to show they are not favouring their race in any way and will try to critique you more and your beliefs will crumble. They will also try to shy away from any type of connection you try to make with the homeland. This I have seen atleast in first generation asian bosses. The second generation born in a different country and culture  may behave differently. \n\n5. ALWAYS HAVE A LIST OF WHATEVER YOU DID FROM THE DAY THE LAST APPRAISAL cycle ends. It sounds weird but after one year during appraisal discussion they ask what have you done in the past year  and you are able to properly recall at the max last three months. If your org has mid year reviews still write it. Sometimes you have to put your case forward and being able to recollect, list and advocate for your points , will greatly help.\n\nI will add more if I am able to recollect.",

I have a lot of friends who put up with some truly awful behaviour because they thought \"all jobs are like this\" and \"another place won't be any better so why bother looking for another job?\". It is not normal to desperately hate your job and lie in bed thinking about quitting. There *is* better out there, probably.\n\nb) Swallowing your pride occasionally can help you move forward. I'm not saying become a doormat or a suck-up, but sometimes the correct act to take for your career is to accept \"This person is definitely wrong, I am definitely right, but there is nothing I can do about it, and the correct action is to calmly state my objections for the record, then choose to do the thing I know is wrong.\" It's not always the right choice, but sometimes it can be. In situations like this, consider if a bit of kowtowing now will save you some major grief later.\n\nc) Attitude really does matter. A lot of Redditors fall into the category of \"fuck you, I'm unhappy, I'm not going to act like I am. if you want me to smile when doing your shitty job, pay me better.\" People who rock the boat, show insubordination frequently, are moody at work, and are otherwise unpleasant to deal with rarely get promoted. A lot of people absolutely hate this, but the truth is that being calm, pleasant, polite and friendly even when you aren't feeling it is part of \"being professional\". Expressing your displeasure might feel satisfying in the short term, but it earns you nothing, and may actually hinder your ability to progress.\n\nAnecdotally; I feel like the kind of people who can't (or won't) supress their own feelings temporarily in order to present the front the business wants to see may not necessarily be suited for the corporate world, because it is absolutely a skill you need to possess. It's not really that different from the positive, friendly demeanour you're forced to use in retail and fast food jobs; same shit, different industry.",

Keep in mind, it's not only about the money - you also have to consider your coworkers, benefits, even commute time, etc. - but for simplicity we'll just talk about money.\n\nIf they can match your other offer, great, stay if you like the job. If not, then you've just gotten yourself a better raise than your current job is willing to give. You don't owe them anything, especially if they don't feel like they owe you anything. You also don't owe the other company anything and can decline their offer. It's just business, and you're not the only one who has done this.\n\nNow that I'm in industry, I've seen this in action and it seems to work.\n\nTL;DR\n* Expect to change jobs every 3+ years to get yourself the best salary/benefits/etc.\n* Know your worth - apply for another job every 6 months or so just to see if you can get a better deal elsewhere.",

Don't, Jim who they are talking about over in wherever who looks like he got beaten  You don't want to find out Jim is dying of ass cancer and you have been spreading he is a drunk.

Always try to be likeable in interviews for that reason. \n\n2. The person whose personality most matches that of your senior management will get promoted to open management slots. If you're applying for management, be aware that it's a small club. \n\n3. Sometimes people get promoted just to get them out of the way. \n\n4. You are always in competition with your coworkers. \n\n5. Your boss is not your friend. He's your boss. It's a role he has to play, even if in \"real\" life he is your friend. \n\n6. Always take credit for your work. \n\n7. In any dispute, management is most likely to believe whoever gets to them first. Everyone warns you against backstabbing. Don't be afraid to stab back first. \n\n8. If you're being paid for 40 hours, but you're working 60, you're underpaid. Never work for free. The deal with work is that they pay you to do it, and their incentive is always to pay you as little as they think they can get away with. A fun little game is to take your paycheck and divide it by the number of hours you worked. That's your real hourly worth to the company. \n\n9.

The key to advancement past individual contribtor is:  Sponsorship, sponsorship, sponsorship.\n\nHaving a senior leader as a sponsor will make or break your advancement inside your company.   With 16 years at my company I'm a senior individual contributor, team lead and trainer.  And breaking the ceiling to move up is difficult.  I have nearly 30 years in the industry / field. \n\nBut the mid 20s guy who worked as a golf pro at the golf course where the senior director worked? Hired off the golf course (has a business degree and a little sales experience... Not that we do sales) in an entry level position in my group.  In less than 5 years he is now a supervisor, the level I'm trying to get to.  Don't think he was really trying to move that fast but his close relationship with the director made it happen.  And honestly he isn't that great at any of the jobs he's been in.  (4 positions). So yes I'm a bit bitter.  Politics in bigger corporations are very real.  Its about selling yourself.  Read leadership books so you know the buzz words. (currently reading 21 irrefutable laws of leadership).\n\nI'm a well paid, respected senior individual contributor with a pretty good job, lots of flexibility and benefits. But I might have basically capped out.  And I can't go looking elsewhere despite the desire as I have a traditional pension that will let me retire very well at 60.  But I have gotten 1 pay raise in the last 4 years (given lump sums to make up for it but not the same) as I'm capped in my band.\n\nMy wife is worried about me moving up due to stress / work load etc.  But moving up in the next band will boost my pension even more.  And more pay while still working.  But dealing with so much more shit. \n\nAlso, if senior leadership are golfers (older ones often are) get good.  Lower the handicap the bigger the raise. \n\nWow... That all came out probably a bit more bitter but some truths in there.  Stressed due to lack of opportunities to advance and the stress that comes with that.\n\nEdit:  so I'm turning 48 soon.  My current supervisor is about my age and a pretty good guy.  We get along well and since we are supposed to have 2 supervisors in our group but have only had 1 in last 18 months he leans on me and the other team lead alot. The 2nd supervisor who left 18 months ago for a lateral promotion was the best supervisor I've ever had.  A lady 15 years younger than me who cared about people who worked for her.  Degree in leadership development or such (masters).  She took each person in our group and helped them with development plans to get exposure with senior leadership and put us in positions for good exposure.  She is amazing person who works too hard especially with the shitty home life she has (shit husband).  (we have gotten drunk before on work trips and golf outings, learn alot about each other).   She helped push me forward and up, got me into the mentor program etc. I would have been happy just moving around and working for her until I retire.  We just clicked very well.",

Do a great job but learn the company culture. I'd everyone sarcastic and afraid? There are problems there, be careful. Does everyone do the bare minimum?

CC your boss on every email you send. Write professionally, but having personality is okay. Proofread before you send, to make sure you actually answered the questions.\n* Ask lots of questions. When you chat with coworkers, start by talking about the weather, their photos, whatever. Then ask them details about their job, and show an interest. People like talking about what they're good at, and giving them that chance makes them like you.\n* Be the person who always has something good to say about other people in the office. Just not gossiping is a start, but it's even better to give credit where it's due. When people talk about you, make sure it's about how nice you are. Bonus points if you email that person's boss to compliment them.\n* Stay organized. A To Do list is bare minimum. Create folders for all of your current projects, then move them to a Complete folder when they're done. Put all key emails and spreadsheets and files in that folder. Consider including a text file with quick notes of the important ideas and timeline. Those records are invaluable when things go wrong.\n\nNow let's talk about meetings.

This is your chance to blow everyone away, if you do it right. Key points:\n\n* Make sure you know who needs to be there. Ask the SMEs before scheduling. If you're unsure about someone, just ask them if they'd like to be included.\n* Bring a visual aid. Always share your screen. Type out an agenda which lays out the most important details. Being able to read a concise summary will help people understand quickly and anticipate what you'll be asking from them.\n* Do not expect your attendees to make decisions for you. You need to think ahead and bring several possible suggestions. List the pros and cons of each option when necessary. Tell people up front which option you think is best.\n* Stay in control. Chances are, someone in your meeting is a talker. Don't let that talker waste everyone's time. Interject and guide by asking questions of specific people.",

            "text": "I love how every top comment is about something negative. So let's get into something more positive.\n\n1. Be proactive. Don't wait until someone tells you to do something. Figure things out yourself. Talk to people etc. Once people realize they can just drop problem on you and they don't have to check on you you will be the solid guy in the company. And if you are not sure if you should do something, inform what you want to do and ask if someone has objections. That is probably first thing that fastracked me into manager position.\n\n2. Don't ask what to do. Propose course of action and start conversation this way. If you ask there is a high chance you will hear answer you don't want. Usually it's some short term shitty patchwork instead of proper long term solution because too many people think short term and worry about apperance. And don't make excuses. If something went bad it went bad. That's it.\n\n3. Admit to your mistakes and own them. And inform your superiors if something bad happens right away. If possible figure out plan to fix the mistake. Most companies want to be efficient. Burrying problems is the least efficient way you can do things. The sooner mistake gets out the sooner you can deal with it. And the sooner higher ups help you with dealing with it. And you will get credits for solving the problem you caused. Really.\n\n4. And finally and that's really most important thing, take care of your responsibilities and don't use other people failures to explain your failure. This one made me a centerpiece of company I worked with. I took care of our end of the deal no matter what. Even if it cost me and my team overtime. Even if someone else screw up we took care of it. This is one of the greatest things you can do. Becsuse in aftermath when there is conversation and like in every corporation - passing the blame. Im usually only guy in the meeting where no one has any ammunition on me. And I make everyone else look bad.\n\n4.1 just remember that it all happened because of your team sacrifice so always highlight that and get them bonuses, extra time off or whatever. And this should not even the debt. It should be higher so it's an reward for their effort. This also created cool thing - every time someone else screw up my team would jump on opportunity to shine. Not only they get extra money or time off but also will shine in the company. So it's win win. And they are really entusiastic about it.\n\n\nThat's my recipe for corporation work. Being proactive and talking to people get you noticed. Proposing solutions instead of asking for orders makes you look competent. Owning you mistakes make you human. And without excuses taking care of your part of the work makes you reliable.\n\nAnd that's fast track to higher positions, big salaries, nice bonuses and most importantly - life full of small accomplishments that will make you feel good. And team of people that will jump into hell with you.",

I think lots of people believe that being nice doing your 9-5 work is enough. so i'll try and give you some work advice that you can apply that should help you progress from my own experience. It really is a different way of thinking. I hope that you find these useful:\n\n1. Learn how to spot areas of opportunity; so many go and 9-5 doing their core task. Take 5 minutes and note down some things that'll make your job easier, chances are it'll be some form of automation - this isn't a bad thing, it should be assisting you in your role, not doing it for you.\n\n2. Learn how to write proposals. so you've got some good ideas on how to improve the work flow or process, now you need to learn how to convey that effectively. There are manh ways to do this but i recommend the following:\n\nA. Objective - what are you trying to achieve\nB. Current Constraints; what is stopping this change from being out in place immediately: training, systems or cash?\nC.  Long term solution - what is the long term solution (hint this might be a huge process/workflow change or a simple system built by IT) Thd point is that this might take 2 weeks or several months to achieve.\nD.  Short term (interim) solution; whilst the 'Long term solution' is built/mapped, what can be done to bring immediate benefits? While you wait for your fancy new CRM function to be built, why not keep a simple excel log in the meantime? \n\n3. Learn how to report; being able to effectively report on stats is surprisingly rare outside of consulting but a skill worth having. Graphs aren't hard to make but can tell a story. Label them properly; if the data is prospective then say so, if the data is showing something important like a trend then explain it ina very simple footnote. Dont forget there are manh graphs but for simple reporting data you can't go wrong with stacked column. It means you wont need 2/3 graphs to report on a simple thing like calls answered or lost.\n\n4. If you are going into your meeting with a director or senior manager and a colleague(s) are coming, make sure they don't cause you to look a bit silly:\n\nA. Make sure they understand the purpose of the meeting and their role in it.\nB. Make sure that they save questions for you or the others in the team until after the meeting or use teams to write directly to each other. The point of this is that your team will look unprepared and meeting time will be wasted on something that be resolved at another time very easily.\nC. If its a weekly meeting to dicuss work, its a common mistake (imo) to go with solutions rather than problems. Thats not incorrect but if you want to be better than that go to the meeting having already done those solutions or at least proposed them. Problems are fine, just only talk about them if your proposed plan is rejected or the solution hasnt worked.\n\n5. Learn to prioritise; what is urgent, what is important and what is urgently important? \n\n6. Reliability is everything; be reliable, commit only to what you can do and under promise and over deliver. Those who are reliable stand a much better chance at propgressing even if they aren't the smartest or best people around.\n\n7. If you point a finger at someone remember thats theres usually 5 pointing back\n\n8.  Remember to have fun; I spent years just working and not nearly enough on myself. Do not do this. Work will always be there but lets face it, there's only so much time to live and that only gets harder as you get older so make a good balance and stick to it. I found it far too easy to be dragged into the culture of living work. Work to live - trust me. \n\nGood luck and I am always happy to lend a hand or offer advice if you need it.",

If you’re dealing with that, get clarity from hr ASAP about who your real supervisor is. And if they can’t give you clarity, get the hell out of there.\n\nOnce you know who your real boss is, then you can prioritize the stuff that comes at you from others properly. You may choose to help someone out, direct them to your supervisor, or disregard them completely. It’s politics at that point.\n\nAlso, remember that your supe will want to protect you from outside work coming your way. You are your his/her resource, after all. So if you’re being pressured to do something outside your responsibilities, or just getting buried, let your supervisor know.\n\nFinally, be honest about your workload with the supervisor.

They won't be your supervisor forever.\n\n2. Have a long term plan, all the way through retirement. Your biggest responsibility is making sure that, in the end, you are on track with your goals. If this involves changing jobs, making short term sacrifices, back to school, reigning in your lifestyle, whatever, do it. The only thing that requires 120% is your personal success. Give today's job 100% and save the other 20% for your long term goals if that is what makes sense at this point.\n\n3. Find mentors. There are actual humans who care about you to be found in the corporate world. When you meet one it will be obvious. Call a mentor when you are faced with a real career decision. \n\n4. Save. Some. Money. People that feel trapped in their jobs are almost always living paycheck to paycheck. A little money in the bank gives you the confidence to pursue opportunity. Cut your spending until you are saving every month. Eventually you will have a year's living expenses in the bank. This is one of the most powerful career advancement tools you can have.\n\n5. Be constantly on the lookout for a better gig at a different company. A concrete offer that improves your situation will come along every couple of years. Take it. Corporate loyalty is a one way street. Being good at changing jobs takes practice, and is the strongest career tool you will ever have.  Do not be concerned at all about being a \"job-hopper\". If there is no better gig, you are doing well today. Stay frosty in case that changes.\n\n6. Never email in anger. Take what time you need to assess the situation. Understand your anger. Obvious anger makes you look immature and undisciplined. No one that matters is afraid of you. \n\n7. Read the company manual, your contract/employee agreement, and any other documents that might affect you. Be ready to refer to them  if someone makes a move on you. Compare these documents between companies.",

This will help you avoid a lot of the red tape and bureaucracy within the company.  It will make you dramatically more effective in your job. \n\nFor example, if you use data in your job and assume your department does not control that data and you are reliant on IT to pull the data for you or give you rights to certain databases so you can access the data. Most corporations require you to submit requests describing why you need the data and a million other things. Then your request goes into a que and IT will get to it in weeks or sometimes months. However, if you have made a good connection in IT, it’s just a matter of picking up the phone, telling them what you need, and you usually have what you need within a few hours or maybe a day or two.\n\nAlso, don’t be afraid to teach someone or multiple people skills that you might be exceptionally good at. Being really good at something can be a catch-22 and may even prevent you from being promoted because they have no one else with that skill set and don’t want to lose you in that position. So when possible, always make sure that there is someone in your department who can do your job as well as you do.

It doesn’t have to be formal, just find someone you respect, and occasionally ask their advice on things. “I’m working on X, and wondering how you would go about Y...”. Don’t overdo it, obviously. \n\nImpress just one person up the chain- probably not your boss, but their boss. Once they know you, you’ll get opportunities to take on (usually seemingly small) projects or tasks that your peers don’t. Once you’re known, bigger stuff comes your way. This can get you that first step up the ladder more quickly, which builds momentum moving forward. I’ve spent most of my career as the youngest person in the room by at least a decade, precisely because of this. \n\nignore the drama. It’ll never go away, it never ends well, and there’s only risk (rarely any reward). People wanna talk shit, just stay out of it. Same goes for all the advice about backstabbing, or whatever. The politics are a game you’re going to have to play, but don’t make it your focus. And honestly- just show up and be yourself. That goes a long way. \n\nLastly, focus on relationships, not transactions. Sometimes you’ll help someone out, and get nothing in return. Sometimes the reverse. Don’t sweat it, just focus on building the relationship. It’ll all even out in the long run. And if you find that it isn’t, there’s plenty of jobs out there. \nI’ve always thought of jobs kindof like dating. I like this one, so I don’t mind if sometimes I’m ahead, sometimes I’m behind.

I found a great role in a service engineering group for steam turbines working in an office with a massive plant where we serviced and produced turbines and generators. It was interesting work that kept me on my toes, but I got tired of it and after 10 years Ihought maybe changing jobs/companies would keep things fresh.\n\nThe problem is, if you have an engineering degree right out of college you can get hired in just about any engineering company and in any role because they know they're going to be training you. If they're hiring someone with ten years of experience they don't want to train you at all, they want you to specialize in what they do already. The only job I could get was working with centrifugal HVAC compressors because I had experience in turbomachinery (spinny stuff). On a sort of insane related note, I now teach high school math and love my job, but that's would be a much longer post.\n\nMy point is, don't get too comfortable in one spot if you want the freedom to move around later. Building experience in just one thing makes you very good at, and also stuck doing, just one thing. Also changing jobs every few years is actually the best way to improve you pay. It's the biggest raise I ever got. (Not switching the to the teacher job btw, that was a steep drop.)",

If you always try to be smarter then others that are there much longer it won't help you at all, it will just cause hate towards you.\n\n\\- Don't talk bad about someone else's work. That however doesn't mean you can't ask questions. If you are smart about it you can make people think by simply asking questions. \"Why did you do it this way?\" \"Can you please tell me about this? I wish to understand what you did so I can understand it for the future\" etc. It could end up being annoying, but it also makes people think without you talking bad about them.\n\n\\- Keep gossip in the tabloids. Gossip on the work floor will end up in serious trouble. Don't participate in it regardless if other employees try to pull you in to it. Just make clear you don't want to gossip as you don't feel right about it.\n\n\\- Don't ally with anyone for long term. Everyone there is there to make money, money corrupts so your allies will change over time. Pay attention and make sure you change allies based on each situation. Be smart about it.\n\n\\- Your interests can change over time. Don't tie yourself to anything and look around, listen to what others say and think about it. It may end up helping you in the long run to find your own interests and shape them.\n\n\\- Keep your desk clean and clear from anything that shouldn't be on it. That means have a small trash can under your desk or near it so you can deposit your wrappers etc. Also make sure your desk is looking professional, don't have anything there that shouldn't be there. Any anime figures for example should be left at home. At work they are more likely to break on 'accident' or 'missing'. \n\n\\- Don't stash snacks in your desk, someone may end up stealing it. So keep it in your bag, backpack or whatever you use to keep your belongings in. This also allows you to take fresh products and keeps things from turning bad and having to deal with that.\n\n\\- You are young, new to the job and don't have the experience yet. So don't take it too seriously that people don't take you too serious or listen to you in the first few years. People need validation that you know what you are doing before accepting your opinions fully. \n\n\\- Try to make sure that you ask if people in your direct area want coffee or tea (if there isn't someone going around with drinks as part of their job) It will make you look better.\n\n\\- Don't use your computer for anything but your work. That means no games or programs should be installed that are not part of your work. Don't visit websites that you shouldn't visit during your work. The admin will be able to see what you are doing remotely most likely, part of their job will be reporting anything that may cause issues for the company.\n\n\\- It's better to clock in 5 minutes early then 5 minutes late. This should speak for itself. If you can't be on time, call ahead so the company knows why you are coming in late. You don't want to be late too often or you simply get replaced. It's a hard reality, either deal with it or you will keep looking for a job for the rest of your life (harsh but true)\n\n\\- If there is a Friday after work party with your company, you are not required to come along to please the boss. That is only for Japan. But even if you don't drink alcohol just come along and drink soda or something. You don't have to be there all the time or for long. It is however a good way to gather intel about who your co-workers are and how they act. This may help you in the long run for deciding who may help you with specific tasks. Just make sure you don't use is to spite people or take someone down. Events like this is to make connections and wind down.\n\nI hope this helps you a bit",

As you change jobs, it’s highly unlikely you’ll get through a first interview without being asked how much you’re currently on.\n\nWith first time jobs it is a little tricky, but by the time you get to HR and are going to put pen to paper you can always ask if there’s anything more they can do.\n\nIn subsequent interviews for other jobs, add 5k on top of what you’re currently making as the answer to how much you make. Then say you’re looking for 5k above that. Replace 5k with whatever works for your region or industry.\n\nIf you don’t reach an agreement, don’t force it, conclude with going away to sleep on it and email back with a soft approach.\n\nAlways try your luck at the final stage when you are made the offer. HR know the exact upper boundaries for salary and if you ask if there’s anything they can do to get 5k on top you may get lucky.

When preparing for a presentation, don’t learn lines like a script, it makes things worse and it doesn’t help unless you’re going to have an auto prompter. Learn the deck, learn the content and learn the material, then make it your own conversation or story through the deck. It’ll come across much more comfortable and engaging.\n\n5. The way you present yourself and talk is one of the most important aspects especially early on while you’re making a name for yourself. Dress well, speak up, speak clear.\n\n6.

Depending on your workload or the urgency of your new assignment you’re within your rights to push back on the deadline where it makes sense.\n\n8. People are not your friends until they are. You will meet people that are assholes and you will meet people that are great. Only time will tell, be aware and cautious while you’re getting to know people in a professional environment.\n\n9. Pay attention in training and meetings. Knowledge is power and if you’re not listening and watching, you’re not going to be useful.\n\n10. Set minor milestones for yourself. These can be anything that makes you feel that you’re growing and learning.\n\n11. Track everything you do and work on, as bullet points. When reviews and evaluations come around, your list will be ready to go and you won’t have missed anything that you’ve done.\n\n12.

            "text": "I know I'm late to the party, but these comments are always the same and you can tell the popular ones are from young people who are largely circulating ideas they've read somewhere. They're mostly true, but often more cold and cynical than necessary (no one cares about you, you're just a replaceable employee, etc). \n\nIt's true you're working for a business and not a charity that will keep you on at a loss. That said, there are always certain types of people who rise up and find success where others do not. \n\nI've been working about 20 years and have become a partner in my field, so I've so far been successful. Not trying to jerk myself off, but if you're getting career advice you should consider the source.\n\nHere's my advice:\n\n- Soft skills are as important as technical skills. Obviously if you're not able to do the technical side of your job you're going to hit a ceiling. I've seen plenty of really smart people not go anywhere though because they come off as assholes or robots. Say hi to people, take the time to get to know your team, listen to their stories and find a way to genuinely be interested.\n\n- Not everybody is out to get you and not everything is a game with an angle. I see too many people get in the way of their progress by inventing ulterior motives based on very little information. These things spiral into self fulfilling prophecies and entirely exist in your head and you may not even realize it's holding you back.\n\n- Work hard, and be sure to take credit for what you do. Again, soft skills come in big here. I don't mean belittle the work of others, I don't mean to brag and be obnoxious, I do mean try and find a way to be sure that your bosses understand your contributions to a project, especially when you crushed it.\n\n- Volunteer for projects quickly even if it sounds hard. The guy who rolls up his sleeves and takes shit on will always be valuable. If something is particular tough, work on communicating it in a way that's concise and try to have some proposed solution so it doesn't look like you're giving up. Don't excessively complain or be a martyr.\n\n- Ask for raises, don't be shy about it. If you're turned down explain why you think you should have it. Ask what steps you need to take to get there. If you're feeling pressure in a meeting don't just agree to something shitty, just say it's not what you were hoping for and you'd like some time to think about it.\n\n- Find a mentor. As I said before, don't be so cynical. If you're giving it your best someone is bound to notice. If someone higher up gets in your corner, listen to every word they have to say. When you don't agree, consider the possibility that you're wrong. You're ultimately accountable for your choices so you have to believe in the advice, but if someone's been successfully doing this for a while and they're willing to help you should listen very carefully and show appreciation.\n\n- Small companies are different than large ones. Larger companies do have more of the issues you'll read about in these comments. If your boss has like 8 bosses then it's true that the guy 8 people removed will only view your department as a number. Smaller companies may have a more family feel and you may get to know the CEO/CFO/President, etc.\n\n- Be honest with yourself. You're smart, everyone's smart. What can you do to set yourself apart? The younger generation I see coming in has wonderful self confidence but sometimes it borders on delusional. I don't care where you went to school, you don't know anything yet. Be a sponge, learn, ask for honest feedback and thank people for positive criticism (anyone can jack you off, it takes a friend to tell you what you're fucking up.\n\n- It's a marathon, not a sprint. Don't be impatient and leave because everything's not happening all at once. Focus on the long term opportunity and not necessarily what's right in front of you.\n\nThat's about it for now. I hope you read this. Good luck!",

Gossip is an extremely powerful thing that you can use to your advantage. Dropping subtle gossip can help you drive a case for a change in the org. \n\n2. Being unprofessional can sometimes mean the difference in making your opinion heard and matter against a backdrop of silence or inaction. It's a calculated thing but if you blow up for example over an issue it becomes a bigger issue and therefore requires everyone around you to approach it differently. \n\n3. People saying only deliver the same quality as those around you. I have seen the exact opposite work so many times. individuals that consistently delivery better work than those around them can absolutely rise to the top quicker. I recognise that for alot of people that isn't the goal of office life - they want that cosy stability. But this also provides a great opportunity to stand out through great work. \n\n4. People saying understand what your boss wants and do that. This is really important but equally important is to understand your bosses standing in the office hierarchy. If they are top of the pecking order it will be a good idea to follow and do what they say. But if they have a really low standing then that's an opportunity for you to take their role by subtly showcasing how your approach might be better than theirs.\n\n5. Passion can get you far.

Look professional.  Shower, shave, avoid heavy perfumes, follow the dress code and dress to impress, try to stay in shape.\n\n7. Become an expert.  Play around in programs, read articles on your business, know your client.  Keep notes and share tricks and tips.\n\n8. Share credit.  If someone helps you with something and your boss is praising you, identify the team members that helped.  They will trust you and the boss will see you as a team player. \n\n9. Never ever talk trash about your job except with your manager or HR in the appropriate setting.",

It's a cliché but it's true, work smarter not harder. \n\nFocus on your roles and responsibilities.  People will ask you for help with things that aren't your job, (usually tech related) and from that point on you'll be their go to. Lose 30 minutes helping Sandra do something that she could have fucking Googled means you lose 30 minutes of efficient work.   It will 100% add more work and responsibility that most likely won't be recognized or actually benefit you. \n\nConnect with those that have done your role before, but more importantly those that have the role that you want in the future. I moved up to a manager role because I knew the person in that role would move up themselves within a year or two. I never bothered them, but tried to grab a lunch or email for a book recommendation every few months. Once you're proven and successful in your current role, start to inquire about how to move up.. in my case, when they announced they were moving up,  I was their recommendation for the role. People hated me because I skipped 10 years of grinding and 60 hour weeks, but that's how you play the game. \n\nInvest in the 401k from the get go, invest at minimum whatever the company will match.

Know what your goals are at the beginning of the year. Make sure those are measurable and attainable, so that when it's time to ask for a raise, and yes you ask for a raise every year, you'll have solid metrics to support your request for something more than the standard 2 or 3 percent. Help out the higher ups and you'll end up with a few little \"above and beyond\" accolades that will help with pay increase and moving up. \n\nI see some suggested not dating from within.

Office coffee is always shit. \n\nThere is always going to be that old, miserable hag who built their whole personality off of the job. In my experience, it’s usually a woman who is constantly micromanaging others even though her job title is not a manager. My advice is to ignore her. Don’t suck up. Don’t apologize. Don’t mistake them for an assistant manager. Just ignore them and focus on your day. They have this weird prison gang mentality that the new and young don’t deserve to be there with them, and need to prove themselves. Prove yourself by being open to constructive criticism from everyone, but still speak your mind when you know you’re in the right. And never let them piss you off. I’ve deal with one of these types at every office job. \n\nGo ahead and have some stuff on hand that you think you could possibly need. Hand cream, hand sanitizer, wet wipes, chap stick, a spare hair styling product and comb, a cologne or body spray, air freshener, breath mints, an extra change of clothes and some snacks. You’ll be spending a lot of time there, and all of these things have been very valuable to me at some point. You never know what little unexpected things can happen that can ruin a day, or make it worse. \n\nSimilar to what I said before, be open to learning a lot, but don’t take shit. Be agreeable, but not too much. Agreeable people don’t get raises or respect. They become work horses. Remember that oftentimes “hard work” is rewarded with more responsibility, but not more pay. Don’t become a manager without a manager’s salary. It happens all the time. Corporations care about maximizing profit, while minimizing spending. Remember that. Your life isn’t a job. Put your health and loved ones first. Use your sick time. Don’t think about work when you’re off the clock. You will get burnt out, and at that point it can be very hard to get your mental health back in order. \n\nEveryone gave some good advice so I’ll end with saying, bring a good pen. A good pen can make your day so much better.",

SEEK ASSISTANCE!\n\nHaving someone to talk to (who “doesn’t have a dog in the fight”) is crucial to everyone’s development \n\nIf you don’t have one, get yourself a therapist, coach, or mentor because they help identify when “the problem” isn’t “the company we keep” (e.g. the organization we work for, the people we work witb, our SO, our relatives, or our social group). \n\nBy that I mean, there are periods in our lives when we seem absolutely certain that “THEY” (i.e. others) are “the (only) problem”, and are consumed by thoughts like others...\n\n- no longer wish to grow (as a whole),\n\n- want [me] to fail (or at least not succeed)\n\n- no longer “have room” for “me” (or the idea or “us”) and/or lack the ability to support me (or “us”) in “our” growth\n\nWhen thinking these types of things, it’s possible you’re right (it’d be “better for them to listen to you”], BUT, its more likely just that “they” are heading in a direction YOU don’t want to be going. \n\nA few other ways having someone to talk to is helpful, is that it;\n\n- grants us a sense of freedom [to just “vent”] without concern for “losing standing“, (ie being “the rock in the relationship”), fearing we’re preventing others a chance to “be”, and/or believing other’s needs [the chance to express emotion) is greater than our own\n\n- creates a space to sound out ideas, no matter how stupid, inconsequential, or silly (which our egos tell us “others” will say they are). Furthermore, they’re there for us when we eventually run out of ideas [after giving it our all]; it also\n\n- grants us access to;\n\n    a.) seeing our “blind spots” (places we’re incapable of seeing the full picture and/or not yet ready to see ourselves in “that way”); and, \n\n    b.) realizing when our minds have actually given up on the situation ... but our hearts want desperately to “stick it out” 😢\n\nLearn to listen carefully (to yourself and others) whenever the notion arises that; “no one [else] wants to do/be better [than they are right now]” because that only becomes true when we’ve lost our sense of safety and security; which is the bare minimum to allow the cognitive dissonance required for us to believe... better is actually possible. \n\nAlso, if you want to be a person who presents solutions, rather than just complains about problems, discovering the answer to “do i want to do better or just feel better?” becomes crucial.day-to-day\n\nBecoming mindful of when/how/where your focus has shifted onto avoiding blame (and/or guilt and shame) is the key to demonstrating a desire to making things better (rather than just avoiding getting fired).\n\nIt’s natural to be drawn to all the elements “outside-our-control” while looking for reasons why something “failed” (or “is failing”), these may include, but are not limited to, focusing primarily on the identification of how/when/where;\n\n- “others”, or someone in particular, who’s  “doing it wrong”\n\n- all the ways “the process” is systemically flawed (i.e. broken-beyond-repair); or,\n\n- all the things which were not “made available to you in the beginning” (e.g. tools/resources, previous works/knowledge, and/or basic training)\n\nSome things I do (to [hopefully] take internal-corrective-action) in the moment; is;\n\n- listen to others with your “whole body” (imagine the person speaking is about to give you the winning lottery numbers)\n\n- listen with an intent to understand the other person’s perspective completely... focus your thoughts on how/why they think the way they do (w/an empathetic ear and/or maintaining the sense “I’d feel the exact same if I actually experienced it the way they did/are”)\n\n- Pay close attention to when you’re “taking it personally” and then.... \n\nDon’t take “it” personally....\nAt times when it seems as though everything another person is saying is being said with the express intent on positioning you as “the problem”.... try to remember, even when “it” (“the problem being presented”) is “all about you”, it’s NEVER ALL about you.\n\nMost people actually want the group to do better, thus, there will be times others point out things you overlooked or “did wrong” (as part of this project/interaction)\n\nHowever, just as is the case whenever a child screams at his mom to “stop yelling!” after simply being asked (with a calm inquisitive voice), “did you finish your homework?”, we, as social creatures, are apt to perceive authentic notes for improvement, from our peers, as having a tone-of-voice of extreme hostility, which only exists in our heads.\n\nAnd, in the very unlikely event others are, in fact, acting out of “spite” (i.e. making it seem like “it’s all your fault”) you can remain calm, collected, and maintain a sense of confidence (from knowing exactly what it is you provide to the team) and quickly expose any would-be-attacker as such. \n\nIn other words, when a feeling of “being attacked” emerges it’s helpful to try to maintain a sense of compassion, for the speaker’s apparent fears, surrounding your presence in the group (and a zero-sum analysis of the group dynamic), and/or their lack of comprehension about what it is you bring to the table.\n\n[Side note: I [39m] still find this especially challenging, in the moment, (and usually end up kicking myself after-the-fact)] realizing I (again) resorted to listening for only items which will help me “dismantle their arguments”., usually presented from being emotional about this or that, so I’m still hoping to grow largely in this respect]\n\nLastly, when things get tough try to find your way to some form of compassion (for yourself or others), because we each have to grow through “it” in order to determine (for ourselves) what’s “true” ... and what’s not.\n\n... and remember...\n\n“If you’re going through hell, keep going” - Winston Churchill",
