    "Why is porn so full of incest now?\nFor generations, porn was predominantly focused on the fantasy of getting with the girl/milf next door, but suddenly, pornography has made a massive turn, and now a lot of it seems to be about banging step-family.  It’s so abruptly prevalent that it’s become a meme.  Is this a Gen Z thing?  Is it possible that there’s a serious generational/psychological issue here that needs to be addressed?": [

The same way that Clowns got popular on pornhub during the release of It, after a cultural powerhouse like GoT, incest fetishes also got popular. \n\n2, the other reason is because it is an inherently taboo dynamic between people. Taboo has been popular in porn for ages. From Sodomy, to age gap, to CNC, BDSM, pet play. affairs and cheating. Having a taboo or touchy subject added to a porno fantasy makes it more naughty. It makes you feel like your doing something bad that isn't right, which can be part of the turn on for a lot of people.\n\nI think a lot of people who consume the  incest porn do it less because  the role-play is actually something they  like, and more just because the stars in it are usually very hot and attractive.

We didn't care if they had any logical explanations through the history. We just said \"It's religious and fuck religions bro\" and broke each and every norm. It just gave us pleasure to break literally everything our ancestors built as a norm.\n\nI'll give an example before starting my point: I'm an atheist, used to be a Muslim. Yet I kinda know why pork is haram. It was probably because of the fact that if pork isn't properly cooked (which takes long -like some hours- since it's a form of meat), it can infect you with taenia.\n\nAnd why incest was bad in religions? Simple. It's due to genetics. First humans prolly had this due to low numbers but it's no longer needed in a multi-billion population.\n\nThe interest in incest has probably started due to hentai animes being increasingly quickly subbed/dubbed. Hentai has all kinds of NSFW. But this paragraph is my opinion. We thought our sisters would be sexier than a non-related girl eventually.\n\nAnd the countries which don't like this trend... would all \"defend' their opinion in the worst way possible. I mean, they were kinda right but with their actions their ideologies went all wrong, thus accelerated the opposing trend, which is incest. But I won't detail this, since this is a minor cause at best.\n\nIn 21st century, at first watching anime was a turn-off. Now being only a Hikikomori weeb would be a turn-off because literally every youngster watched or played anime stuff, whether they knew it or not. Because we have consumed the US cartoons too fast to be able to reject the chance to watch more cartoons, even though it's not 'lil 'ol 'Murican ones.\n\nAnd given every new generation is becoming more and more isolated from their peers, everyone going home-officey Hikikomori weebs is the endgame for this debate, thus always watching animes or playing games.\n\nThough don't worry, besides anime hentais they mostly ain't related in NSFW videos at all (with the exception of Johnny Sins and Kissa Sins maybe, and they aren't blood related but married) and not many people dare to actually perform unprotected intercourse with their siblings, due to knowing the genetic problems it will bestow (!) upon their children.

Sprinkle in isolation from COVID this was kinda bound to happen. \n\nBut it isn't just incest lately there's also a rise in cucking which is honestly more bizzare than incest to me because I can't picture anyone getting off to being cheated on. Which is kinda fucked up, but rule 34 has kinda pointed out that if it exists there's porn of it. Rule 35 is probably what damned us by saying \"if it does exist and there's no porn then make it\"",

This, along with the other sexual aspects and popularity of the show made it a bit more mainstream.\n\n2) The rise in single parenthood. The percentage of single parents is on the up and up for decades. So we have a lot of people meeting other people with kids, meaning we have a lot more step siblings than before, and a lot of them have now grown up in the internet age and fantasise about their step siblings to a degree. \n\nI have also seen people say 'it's only at the start so it pays off for people into it and shouldn't bother those who want to skip it'.

But they don't!\n\nI get why people would be turned on by the taboo of incest porn, but am mystified why they're turned on by the most half-assed attempt at it.\n\nThen again, I pretty much only like gonzo porn (where the \"scene\" is a girl is there to fuck on film for money and is aware of the camera) because it's the only kind that's actually believable and real, so maybe I just care about that a lot more than most people do.",

I'd like to also point out, I'm no expert in anything I'm about to say lol\n\nI believe every mainstream media medium of entertainment (music, movies, TV series, even porn) has some kind of rudimentary reason most people enjoy it. I don't believe most times are due to the obvious messages that the medium directly conveys. That's speaking generally, of course. So, let's get more specific. \n\nHypothetically, if this were in a dream, then many psychologists would say that those people are expressing some desire to get more intimate with that person, albeit subconsciously. \"But it's real life, while people are conscious!!\" Yes, but that doesn't stop our subconscious from expressing itself in a similar way. \n\nIn the case of porn, we have to look at underlying messages, rather than titles. What major instinct are people being drawn to quench? My best guess is intimacy. I don't think it matters that it's a family matter at all. I think it has to do with long term intimacy. Having someone in your life for so long, that you'd know almost anything about them, then having sex with them... that does seem to line up with how truly intimate the relationship is. And it also suggests, as it has become very popular, that there are many that are feel that hole in themselves, that they do not have a deep relationship like that, yet yearn for it. \n\nI could go on about the different things I don't believe it relates to, but I believe that would only dilute the point, rather than help enforce it.",

            "text": "Incest was highly popular in erotica well before it became popular in porn. People say it's a cheap way to make something spicier, and while that's true, that's not the core reason people enjoy it. \n\nIncest was popular in erotica because it's a way to add conflict to sex. Normally porn is the opposite of conflict; it's just two people fucking. Most popular porn genres add some kind of conflict to the sex act. Incest being the ultimate taboo can create the strongest inner conflict. Other popular ones are things like blackmail or other forms of coercion.\n\nThe reason it's step-family is because it's often just straight up illegal or at least against a site's terms of service to have incest porn. So this sort of thing is called pseudo-incest, where if you're an incest fan you sort of mentally delete the 'step-' from everything. On certain platforms even step-family is banned so they will say things like \"the man of the house gets with a younger woman who lives with him\" and such.\n\nIf you go on sites like literotica.com most of the top stories are incest based. Before the advent of video porn being very easily accessible on the internet, there was a time where the entire top 10 stories on the biggest erotica site on the internet were tagged as incest.\n\nAnother important aspect of it is, just like incest fans can easily ignore the 'step' part, non-incest fans can also fairly easily ignore the whole family aspect much of the time. So even if this results in a porn video just being 1% more popular, they will do it every time.\n\nNow, I'm also not gonna say, this is all dictated by algorithms or needs of storytelling. Incest is an extremely popular fetish regardless of these things. Why? I suppose because it's so 'forbidden and wrong and obscene.' But I don't think most incest porn lovers have any actual interest in committing incest  with their own family, they want an imaginary other super hot family to bang in their fantasies and not reality.",

Meanwhile step-fam porn usually centers around normal-looking people in normal clothes experiencing an awkward situation (walking in on them, spying and getting caught, blackmail, whatever). A major hook is that one or both are uncomfortable with it but give in eventually thanks to the hotness of the other one.  Often this process is incremental (don't touch me, just look...ok maybe you can touch, but that's it...ok I'll let you put in the tip, but no more...ok fine, please fuck me!)  The idea that either the girl or the guy being able to turn on a reluctant partner so much that they lose all of their inhibitions one by one is a major fantasy for most people, men and women, because that's what we all wish we could do to those we're attracted to.  \n\n\nIn the most bizarre, ironic twist of our generation, step-fam incest porn wound up growing in popularity largely because it was more believable than normal porn, and therefore more relatable, even in light of the ridiculousness of the actual story itself.",

That way you can enjoy the complexity but avoid the actual feeling from watching someone crossing such a boundary. \n\nSecondly, a psychological lesson, I believe since the rise in internet/streaming porn it has pushed people and providers to test the limits because novelty works especially when it comes to masturbation. Let’s say someone is 30 years old and has been masturbating to online porn for half their life, at some point the one browser tab of a regular guy/girl scene won’t be satisfying - so you look for more boundary pushing subjects. Same reason people will have multiple tabs and windows of videos open and Jill between them. How quickly our brains need more and new info. \n\nCrazy to think what that means for the next decades.

So the whole fake incest thing is more of an excuse to have younger men doing porn and that appeals to this generation. It’s also why they are drawn to hentai. They rather see cartoon porn than what looks like their parents banging. It’s also why they love streamers. No old guy in the mix.",

Maybe porn has been so much more available for so long that we've become desensitized to unemotional hole stuffing. Maybe a generation that had easy access to hard core pornography when they were children developed a sexual framework that includes their closest relationships at the time. Maybe people have a harder time imagining sincere relationships with people they meet out in the world, and so they can only imagine having emotional intimacy with people in a very narrow set of roles.\n\n\n\n\n\nOr maybe I'm just a pervert.

Now, the rawest anal sex with whipping and torture and peeing on or in people is mainstream porn (more or less). I think it's something of an issue, especially with younger men who don't realize the performance they're looking at has very little to do with having sex with a partner for most people.\n\nHonestly, the 80's porn was better than modern porn. It has actual production values, they filmed out on the town as well as in studios, and the people looked like real people (though often abnormally beautiful, of course, for the women), not porno barbie and porno dumb grunt with comically oversized penis with tattoos everywhere.",

If you are freaked out and disgusted by this, or perhaps do not believe me, I encourage you to read Father Daughter Incest by Judith L. Herman who goes into great detail about this and has examples pulled from popular culture. It's a very uncomfortable read.\n\n\nHowever the tide started to turn on popular opinion on the matter, or perhaps became a less openly discussed topic, yet demand still existed and so the porn industry has gradually began filling the gap. That we've allowed it and can find excuses where as a premise it's acceptable is actually pretty disturbing.\n\n\nIf you want to really dig into it then between 40% to 70% of women diagnosed with BPD usually have a reported history of CSA. All those claims men make about having wild sex with \"crazy girls\" who they usually armchair diagnose with BPD or say they have \"daddy issues\" are probably a lot closer to a deeply troubling truth than they would like to know.",

For years now, surveys and studies have shown that the majority of young people are having way less sex than peer groups from past decades would have, and many report struggling to even find romantic partners.\n\nSo my totally-unfounded, unsubstantiated theory is that the new wave of incest porn is partly a reaction to that. It presents a very simple, very gratifying fantasy to the generation I just described: ‘Wouldn’t it be great if you had a hot, horny step-sister/mom/aunt who lived in the house with you and just wanted to fuck all the time? No having to meet anyone, no dating or seducing, just easy unlimited fucking whenever you want. And it’s also taboo and secret, just to keep things spicy.’\n\nIt appeals to older dudes in the same way. No having to face your depreciating physical attributes and get yourself together enough to win over a hot young woman. No worrying about conducting an affair without your wife suspecting something. Just fuck your step-daughter or her best friend or maybe both in the laundry room.\n\nJust my two cents, probably assuming way too much thoughtful consideration on the part of whoever writes the scripts and chooses the titles.",

So...if popular regardless of gross factor and no accounting for morbid curiosity,  anything that's paid and popular is seen as \"accepted\" and \"encouraged\" is caused they get money for being a trainwreck.

(It can be positive or negative, depends on how's it's being used) \n\n\nSo just like that first few guys who got bank from making \"how to build an oasis in the jungle with nothing but hand tools\" and there are now a lot of that type of videos on YouTube with new channels all the time, so too are weird sub culture but gross for a reason taboos are popular for porn. \n\nAlternately or in addition to.the fact that back in the day there was no chemistry in a lot of porn, there was a lot of lube and no foreplay, and the sexual tension that people were looking for or needed to climax that would normally come from a partner was only found in well shot movies that were showing the dark side of sexual abuse, the tension there was horror and to abused people who haven't worked through issues it feels the same as sexual tension. I was a kid when I figured it out and thank PBS every day for educating me without gates or restrictions cause there are a lot of broken people out there and cinematic incest porn getting me where I needed to go let me know in my particular case, I was not okay sexually and spent 10 years working through my shit and keeping my v card. \n\nAnd when I couldn't get off to that when it felt gross and not hot, I figured I was okay, doc agreed, good litmus test for me in my specific case.  I lost my v card as an emotionally healthy adult. I've done things y'all might think weird, but nothing ever remotely close to gross.\n\nSo I guess beware of rule 34. \n\nWhy is there porn of this? \nRule 34, that's why. \n\nWhy is it popular? \nCause the internet popularity is as real and unmanipulated as the us stock market.\n\nGlad you asked. Apparently I had some pent up resentment about \"them\" still normalizing incest. It's just..nope. hope I wasn't too preachy. I tutored for too long and lost my lines of acceptable during quarantine. I treat anyone who reads my comments as if they know what I mean cause they know my heart cause I'm human and humans innately have good hearts, like to help are curious and compassionate. \nWhen in doubt read it.un Levar Burton's voice...everyone agrees he's nice. \n\nGme.",

Sure, go ahead, whatever.\n\n\"Sure, go ahead, whatever\" has become a very prominent thing in connection with sex. It's commonly called \"acceptance\", but tomato, tomato.\n\nSex has basically become \"vanilla\" in almost all of it's adaptations.

The same thing occurs for decades now in music, for centuries in literature. Now, porn is added to the mix - the general perception on what is \"public entertainment\" has a new addition.\n\nPorn used to be exciting to people because it was porn. Considered taboo. That's no longer the case, so the industry needed a new taboo to take the old one's place. Step-family relationships are that taboo. And because porn is mostly based in America, this works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn Germany, sexual relationships with anyone in your family line - so long as they are not in a directly vertical or directly horizontal line (so excluding actual siblings, or parent-child relations) are completely lawfully sound. So long as the relationship in the family tree includes a change in direction (your aunt, for example, is a step up, and then a step to the side), it's fine.\n\nStep-family goes a step further towards not being minded since there is no blood relation. How awkward that is at dinner is the problem of the people in the relationship.\n\nBut America is weird, so sexual relationships within step-families are considered taboo, and the porn industry earns a lot of money (or views, depending).",

            "text": "Most of the people I speak do are not in gen z.  Some are.  But most are millennials or gen x.  To be honest I spent a minute researching the topic of this question in detail and was sorta shocked by what I encountered.  A very large portion of men and women across the globe are actually deeply into the incest fetish.  The problem is this kink is almost exclusively linked to CSA(child sex abuse), even though the large portion of people consuming are not abusers or concerned with abusing anyone.  Most people who I read about, speak to etc, have had some type of interaction with this, most generally speaking brothers and sisters, but on occasion a parent.  The thing is there is a push in society to pass “free love” bills, which would also allow of age adults to have sexual and romantic relations with family members.  So the porn industry, along with many people across the web are pushing incest into the mainstream.  This actually started when HBO first aired game of thrones, and many people were turned on seeing the Lannister siblings hooking up weekly.  \n\nThe thing is what the facts say;  upwards to 80% of siblings before adulthood sexually explore, or even have sex with consent, psychology and justice offficials call this “exploring” and as long as both parties were into it, there is nothing illegal or wrong about, it’s actually quite normal.  Because of this a large number of siblings have either sexual attraction they suppress, or urges hey hide to re-visit that memory.  A lot of siblings actually do end up hooking up but the stigma in society keeps them from continuing or sharing those facts publicly outside of anonymous forums like Reddit.  There actually isn’t a psychological issue(when talking on consensual incest), what is a psychological issue is the fact that human kind has practiced forms of incest for procreation and for pleasure for almost 100,000 years.  In the last 2000 it has become taboo, and in the last 400 years it has became a vile and disgusting thing(the word itself incest simply means “unclean”).  To put that into perspective with other non sexual taboo topics, in the same Frame of time 400/100,000 years we have became obsessed and violent over skin color.  So in my humble opinion, those who mind other business and judge them have the mental issue, not the people exploring themselves in a way mankind has for 100,000 plus years.  We wouldn’t be who or what we are, doing the stuff we’re doing, speaking freely in free countries if people that took part I. Incest didn’t exist.\n\nLastly the only logical and real consequence of incest is a very small chance of defects.  People will tell you otherwise, that they happen all the time, but it’s not true in the slightest.  Long repeated breeding via incest can cause some issues, but once almost never does.  Doesn’t mean take that risk, but the effect of incest on genes in one generation is no different than if two people with the same recessed genetic flaw mated and that flaw became active.  You wouldn’t tell two mentally ill people with Down syndrome they can’t have kids, and there’s a very high likelihood they will produce someone with their flaw, but we let it happen everyday.  So peoples excuse about “polluting the gene pool” is very hypocritical to say the least.  That’s also assuming all cases of incest need to end on pregnancy.  Most cases of incest are not romantic but sexual and convenient and why they occur.",
