So, if such a pill is similar to female birth control pills, where they increase the chance of heart attack/stroke, I'd need to pass.\n\nThat said, I don't even like the female birth control pill. When I learned women should be on birth control, I just shrugged at it. But then one day I learned about the side effects of increased chance of heart attack/stroke/blood clots, I was horrified. It hurts my feels to think there might be at least one woman out there that either died or is partially disabled merely due to birth control pills. That's absolutely horrible! I'd wear a condom 365 days a year if it meant no one dies/gets disabled.\n\nBut then I went around talking to my female friends about it. I talked to like 3 and they pointed out that even if they weren't having sex, they'd take the pill due to PMS relief. So, I feel better about the pill now as I can only accept PMS is a horrible thing that is worth the chance of these side effects. But I am still not happy about the women of the world having to put up with those possible side effects. It's just another way women are getting screwed, and not in the fun way.\n\nThe world needs to come up with something new.

Pregnancy is a something that permanently physically changes your body, destroys you for nine months, can ruin your career and social life, and potentially kill you. For women, the cost is definitely worth the reward.\n\nFor men, the same side effects are not worth it. Men don't risk actually getting pregnant and the social aspects are different. Men with or expecting children are generally considered more employable and promote-able than women with or expecting children. There is still the social changes, but men are capable of avoiding a lot of them because of how our society is built.\n\nSo the reward for men to have some form of birth control varies significantly from person to person. A man in a long term relationship with a partner that has terribly negative side effects to their birth control, and who is not interested in having kids but still wants to get down would be more willing to accept the cost than a single 20-year-old who is just looking for a quick score. \n\nThere is a male birth control in development called vasalgel that prevents sperm from being released.

First off, who is geberally seen to bear the most consequence for a pregancy? The mother. Yes, child support is a thing, along with potentially being \"trapped\" into a marriage that may not have happened otherwise, but let's be real. That all pales in comparison to the sheer physical and emotional stress that a pregnancy puts onto mothers.\n\nSo, with that, the current model of birth control puts the decision making into the hands of the person who would experience the higher level of consequence. For those who don't trust BC, can't take it due to medical, religious, or financial reasons, then the main alternative is a very tangible and visible condom.\n\nNow flip that around. If male BC was a more widespread thing, then a potential mother who is not currently taking BC, no matter the reason, now has to trust that their partner *is* actually taking theirs, in the prescribed manner. And for those who don't trust and insist on a condom still? Yeah, let's just play games with male egos.\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad idea, don't get me wrong, and I'm sure there are plenty of guys who would obtain it and use it specifically to not become a father, but it seems to me that navigating the social effects of such a medication would be very challenging.",

This substance would in effect \"filter\" your sperm out. So, you'd still be able to shoot bullets. They'd just be harmless bullets.

For women and AFAB, pregnancy and childbirth is very dangerous with a lot of very serious complications, so comparing the side effects of hormonal contraception to that, it's desirable.\n\nFor men and AMAB however, there are no physical side effects to getting someone pregnant. Of course in most of societies structures you would now be a dad and have to financially support a family and raise a child, which for most people can be physically and mentally taxing. But essentially the medical industry doesn't take that into effect because that's more of a societal thing than a medical thing. Therefore, because men don't suffer medically from impregnating someone, the side effects of the male contraceptive pill are not \"worth it\" and are therefore not approved.\n\nWould just like to say that I am a woman incase anyone assumes I'm on some agenda or anything, and also I do believe male hormonal contraception should be available. I feel like an exception can be made to the side effects outweigh the risks rule, and grown men are sensible and wise enough to make a decision on what's best for them and the couple they're in (if that's the case). \n\nHowever, a little side note - many men already take a condom off sneakily because they don't like the \"side effects\" of them (less sensitivity). I do believe some of the men who are saying they would definitely take out, would end up taking it inconsistently or lying about taking it because they don't like the side effects. A lot of women have trust issues when it comes to trusting men with contraception, and for good reason.",

Currently you can choose between either getting infertile & using a drug that‘s used for chemical castraction or you could get the suicide pill. Honestly I don‘t think that male birth control pills will be a thing in the next decades. It‘s extremely complicated since you can‘t fake a pregnancy. You could either use female hormones like estrogen etc (which would be bad for obvious reasons) or testosteron which would lead to reduced genital size, increased aggression, high blood pressure etc. (there‘s a reason why most people don‘t use steroids). So yeah the closest thing would be a vasectomy but the chances of reversing that decrease rapidly so unless you don‘t want (more) children that‘s not really a good idea.\nIf there were a pill that would 1) work and 2) have acceptable side effects (i.e. not result in infertility or suicide) I would at least consider it and if it seems safe & effective I would think about using it (it‘s safer than condoms and you can‘t really control if your partner took the right meds). Although ONS etc would still require a condom if we don‘t have vaccines for STDs until then (which seems more realistic).",

It works by replacing your natural testosterone production thereby shutting down the testicles and sperm production. \nFor the clinical trial I was on the highest dose.

Synthetic testosterone had me put on about 15 lbs of mostly muscle. \n2. My libido fell off a cliff. I know that sounds bad but it's so refreshing. Not thinking about sex so much is pretty cool actually. My masturbation frequency fell significantly. I had a clearer mind in my day to day. \n3.

Also note** I'm not saying the men who don't want kids are bad dads. They just never think its the right time until it does happen and then they start the journey as a dad and become a great dad its called a wonderful surprise. I guarantee most reading this are accidents or not planned by your parents but yet they are still grateful they had you none the less. There are more unplanned kids with loving parents then there are planned kids with loving parents. Even if you say I want kids at some point in my life and next day your girl is pregnant is still unplanned. A planned child is when both partners are trying for a baby. My point: get a vasectomy if you don't want kids ever. If maybe one day, kids would be great for your family keep using condoms until you have your kids and then you get the vasectomy because birth control pills for male is not work the crap that comes with it.",
