Upon entering the room sure enough he sees three large holes, the man decides to ignore them and proceeds to get ready for bed. Later that night the curiosity was just too much to bear so he masturbated until he was ready and stuck his dick in the first hole and came. His dick came out all brown and sticky. He waited a few minutes until he was ready again and masturbated. He came into the second hole, it felt pleasant inside. His dick came out all slippery and wet. He waited another few minutes and masturbated. He stuck his dick in the third hole. He felt a sharp excruciating pain on his dick, he pulled it out to find his foreskin missing and a mountain of blood all over it. The next morning he packed up his things and walked downstairs, he returned the key and was about to leave when the man called out to him \"you didn't cum in the holes did you?\" the man shook his head the man behind the counter then said\n\n\"Well my, Son is now gay, My daughter is pregnant and My pencil sharpener is broken\"",

I don't tell it though.... But since the post literally asks for it I'll tell it here and just censor the words a bit.\n\n\nThree white, gay male roomates are walking down a beach in Florida, having a good time and enjoying the summer weather. One of the men sees a green emerald Sparkling in the sand and asks his roomies to help him dig it up. They realize the emerald is just part of a very large, gold, jewel encrusted lamp and they are all excited to find out how much the thing is worth. As they are dusting the sand away, a cloud of smoke comes from the lamp and from this, a genie emerges.\n\n'***I AM THE GREAT BATHURAZA. I WILL GRANT THREE WISHES. AS THERE ARE THREE OF YOU, YOU MAY EACH RECEIVE ONE WISH. BUT I AM IN A WEAKENED STATE AS I HAVE NOT USED MY POWERS IN CENTURIES. YOU WILL ALL HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME WISH, AND I WILL GRANT IT FOR EACH OF YOU.***'\n\nSo the three gay guys huddle up and begin hemming and hawing about what their wish should be and what they all want equally. One of the guys, the extreme conservative, fox News type of the group, blurts out his idea.

One Saturday the man is cleaning his house and preparing for the next week, when the man realizes he forgot a bottle of wine. The man has a lady coming over that night so he needs to leave for a second and grab a bottle. \n\nSo the man leaves and grabs a bottle of wine to come back and see the cage is wide open and his friend isn’t in his room. He checks the house and finds the parrot going erratic, humping everything in sight. The parrot has a raging erection. The man walks in and obviously asks what happened. The parrot says “I ate the blue treat on your dresser since a woman is coming over later, and then I don’t know what happened!” The man is confused and remembers that he left his last viagra on his bedroom dresser. The man freaks out and panics, because the pharmacy is about to close. He grabs the parrot and throws it in the freezer in a weird moment of anger and frustration and races to the pharmacy before it closes. \n\nHe gets to the pharmacy and luckily they aren’t closed. He gets the pills and comes back. The whole way home he is really regretting throwing his friend in the freezer and praying he’s ok. He speeds home and rushes to the freezer. When he gets there he’s shocked to find the parrot soaking wet with sweat. He asks the parrot why he’s soaked and the parrot responds with “Do you have any idea how hard it is to open a frozen chickens legs?”",

Let me demonstrate.\"\n\nThey stop, and the woman gets on. She's dressed to the nines and is absolutely stunning. The bus driver turns to her and says, \"tickle your cunt with a feather?\"\n\n\"Excuuuuse me?!\" the woman exclaims, with a look of indignation and rage spreading on her face.\n\n\"Typical country weather!\" the bus driver says. Immediately, the woman's expression softens and a blush spreads across her cheeks. She smiles sheepishly, flits her hand through her hair, and replies, \"oh yes, it's quite lovely.\" \n\nAs she walks to take her seat she casts alluring glances back at the driver.\n\n\"Unbelievable!\" the man exclaims. \"What just happened?\"\n\n\"Well, for some reason, misdirecting these women with something outrageously offensive, and then following up with something pleasant makes them incredibly sexually receptive.\"\n\nStill in disbelief, the man asks the bus driver to show him again. It isn't long before an even more stunning woman gets on, at which point the bus driver repeats the interaction. The gorgeous woman is even more flustered, and before she can go take her seat, the bus driver asks for her number. She offers it up instantly and even mentions that she has no plans that evening.\n\nTo say the man's jaw had dropped would be an understatement. \"You gotta let me try this,\" he says to his bus driver friend, \"I haven't been laid in months.\"\n\n\"I don't know, it's not as easy as it looks. You have to get everything perfect. The phrasing; the inflection. There's no room for error,\" replies the driver hesitantly.\n\n\"No, I got this. I watched you do it twice. I know how to do it,\" says the man.\n\nAs they pull up to the next stop, the driver says, \"Well alright. Here, why don't you try it on the woman who's about to get on? Remember, it's 'tickle your cunt with a feather?'\"\n\nThe man waves his hand dismissively, \"Yeah yeah, I got this. Let me do it myself.\"\n\nThe man watches as the most beautiful woman he's ever seen steps on to the bus. She's so incredible that she makes the previous two women look positively plain by comparison.\n\nThe man turns to her, smiles, and asks\n\n\"Scratch your pussy with a stick?\"",

I yelled from the other room they should do it put on a Jimmy soul song with the speakers turned way up: \"if you want to be happy for the rest of your life never make a pretty woman your wife, so for my personal point of view get an ugly girl to marry you! \"  He laughed, his girlfriend hated it",

They go at it hammer and tong for several hours, in multiple positions, sheiking and howling, while the whole time the old husband is standing at the end of the bed, whipping the towel around his head with everything he's got.\n\nFinally the couple climax together, screaming and shaking in delight before collapsing on the bed in a sweaty mess.\n\nAs the young man lies there, catching his breath, the old boy taps him on the shoulder and says \"THAT'S how you wave a towel!\"",

Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight -- then nothing but silence!\n\nJust when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar.

They make cheese that they sell along with extra milk to make a living.\n\nOne morning the farmer goes out to the shack of a barn and finds the milk cow dead. He starts to worry how he’ll provide for his family and ends up getting some rope and hangs himself in the rafters.\n\nA little while later his wife comes out to the barn and finds the milk cow dead as doornail and her husband hanged in the rafters. She also gets some rope and hangs herself.\n\nShortly after their eldest son comes out and finds the milk cow dead as doornail and his parents hanged in the rafters. He doesnt know how to break the news to his two younger brothers so he walks down to the river near their farm.\nHe gets to the river and sees a beautiful female leprechaun sitting with her feet in the water.\nShe asks,\n“Why the sullen face lad?”\n\nHe says “Well me parents are hanged in the rafters o’ the barn an’ the prized milk cow is dead as a doornail. I dunno how I’ll care fer me two younger brothers.”\n\nThe lady leprechaun responds “I tell you what lad, if you can do something for me I’ll help ya out!”\n\nThe eldest son says “Wha’ can I, a poor farm boy do fer you, a magical leprechaun, that you couldn’t do yerself?”\n\nShe says “If you make love to me #FIVE times in row without stoppin’, I’ll bring both your parents back to life along with the milk cow, good as new.”\n\nHe thinks to himself a moment and thinks, “I’m a healthy virile man, I should be able to do it.” So he agrees to do it.\nHe makes love three times in a row and is unable to continue so the lady leprechaun kills him.\n\nWell a while after the middle son comes out of the house, finds both parents hanged in the rafters, the milk cow dead a doornail and sees footprints in the dirt trail to the river. He walks to the river and finds his oldest brother dead annnd with his pants down as well? He gets halfway back to the farm when he sees the same beautiful lady leprechaun sitting on a boulder.\n\n“Why the dour look boy?” She asks\n\n“Well me parents are dead, hanged in the rafters and the milk cow is dead as doornail too. Me brother is laying dead on the river bank, with his pants down? I dunno how I’ll care fer me little brother.”\n\nThe leprechaun offers him the same deal as the eldest brother and the middle sone thinks to himself “I’m a young healthy lad, I know I can do it!” So he agrees.\nHe makes love to her four times but is unable to continue so she kills him too.\n\nSometime later the youngest son comes out of the house. He finds both parents hanged in the rafters, the milk cow dead  as doornail and find bother brothers dead as well. Strangely with the pants down too? The youngest son makes his way back to farm where he finds the same beautiful leprechaun sitting on the fence of the farm.\n\nShe says to him “why the long face boy?”\nAnd he responds “Well me whole family is dead and the milk cow is too, dead as. Doornail. I dunno what I’ll do.”\n \nThe leprechaun tells him, “If you can make love to me #FIVE times without stopping, I’ll bring your whole family back to life, e’en the milk cow.”\n\nThe youngest brother thinks for minute and asks “Wha’ if I make love to you ten times without stopping? Wha’ would I get them?”\n\nThe leprechaun giggles and says “Boy if you can do that, I’ll bring your whole family back, e’en the milk cow #AND give ya crock of gold that’ll never run out.”\n\nHe thinks a little bit and asks her again “Okay well Wha’ if I make love to ya fifteen times without stopping? Wha’ would I get then?”\n\nThe leprechaun let’s out a small laugh before saying “Boy if you could do that, I’d bring your whole family back, e’en the milk cow. Give you that same crock of ne’er ending gold and change you lowly hovel of a farm in to a lofty mansion on many acres!”\n\nHe thinks for a moment and says “Wha’ about twenty times without stopping? Wha’ then would I get?”\n\nThis time the leprechaun bursts into a fit of laughter and tells him “Boy, n’one can do that!”\n\nThe youngest brother responds “Well how do ya think the milk cow died?”\n\nAlways gets the best reactions, especially if you do your best Irish accent 😂😅",

And to his surprise he felt something way up the man's bowels. He grabbed it and pulled it out, all the while the man whimpered. When the object was fully removed the doctor saw that it was a red rose, he looked quizically to the man who lit a cigarette and said with a thick, content voice: \"Thanks, that rose is for you\".",

He doesn't seem to have much luck, until one day, he comes across a Harley with a 'For Sale' sign on it. \n\nThe bike looks better than new, although it is 10-years-old. It's shiny and in pristine state.\n\nHe buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for a decade.\n\n“Well, it's quite simple,” says the seller, “whenever the bike is outside and it's going to rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome as it protects it from the rain,” and he proceeds to hand Joe a jar of Vaseline. \n\nThat night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. \n\nNaturally, they take the bike there.\n\nJust before they enter the house, Sandra stops him. “I have to tell you something about my family,” Sandra exclaims with a look of embarrassment, “when we eat dinner, we don't talk. In fact, the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.”\n\n“No problem,” he says... and in they go.\n\nJoe is immediately shocked. Right in the middle of the living room lays a huge stack of dirty dishes. In the kitchen, another huge stack of dishes. There are dishes piled up on the stairs, in the corridor… everywhere he looks there are dirty dishes.\n\nNevertheless, they sit down for dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.\n\nAs dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.\n\nHe leans over and kisses Sandra.\n\nEveryone’s mouths remained sealed.\n\nHe reaches over, fondles her breasts, and smears her lipstick. Nobody says a word.\n\nSo he stands up, pulls her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table, and fucks her, right there in front of everyone to see including poor Osmond, the family dog.\n\nHis girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom appalled when they sit back down, but still, someone has yet to speak at the dinner table.\n\nHe looks at her mom. She's got a great body too.\n\nJoe grabs Sandra’s mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and fucks her in every which way but loose right there on the dinner table.\n\nShe has a big orgasm but does not fail to let one word out of her mouth and they both sit down.\n\nHis girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling and mom is beaming from ear to ear. But still… total silence.\n\nAll of the sudden, there is a loud clap of thunder and it starts to rain.\n\nJoe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.\n\nSuddenly, the father shouts: \n\n“OK! I'll do the fucking dishes!”",

Lucky for you , tonight I’m feeling generous , so if you boys can get out your dicks, and they measure up to 13 combined inches, I’ll let you go.”  \n   We all look at each other and decide we have no choice but to play along , so I go first. The cop brings his measuring tape up to me and says,  \n  “8 inches boy, Howdy! We’re off to a good start!”   \n     He goes up to him (friend) next, same deal\n “oh 4 inches, ok not too bad , just one more inch needed and you boys are good to go!”\n  So now you’re up. He pulls out his measuring tape and approaches you, and after measuring , he exclaims, “1 inch exactly , you boys are free to go ! “\n   Relieved , we drive off and you turn to us both and say “ you guys are lucky I had a boner”",

After dinner one evening as they are strolling along the Boardwalk heading toward their hotel, they see a marquee on a theater proclaiming, “The Amazing Walovitz: One Night Only!”\n\nThe man turns to his wife and says, “Honey!  Can it be?  Can it be the same Walovitz we saw perform on our honeymoon here, 40 years ago?”  And they buy tickets for the show. \n\nAnd it was!  It was the same Walovitz, now at least 80 years-old, performing tricks for the packed house. And for his encore, Walovitz’s beautiful young assistant brought out three watermelons and a short table, setting it up in front of Walovitz and placing the three watermelons on the table in a line. Walovitz then drops his pants and begins rubbing himself until hard and then … wham!  wham!  wham! … he smashes each watermelon with his enormous hard-on. The crowd goes crazy and the curtain drops. \n\nThe couple is amazed and find their way to the stage door, hoping to meet Walovitz and tell him of the amazing coincidence of seeing him perform on their honeymoon and again that night, 40 years later. After a short wait, the door opens and the Amazing Walovitz ambles out. Excited, the man relates the story to him and Walovitz nods and smiles. Then the man says, “Walovitz, it was the same show as 40 years ago. All but the encore. Forty years ago, you used grapes!”\n\nWalovitz sighed. “Well,” the Amazing Walovitz replied, “the eyes aren’t as sharp as they used to be,”",

He finds it, but next to it is a groggy leprechaun, rubbing his head and swearing. \n\n“Oh, dear. I am so very, very sorry,” O’Malley says to the leprechaun, “are you okay.”\n\n“Yeah, I’m fine. But you’re not supposed to see me. Fair is fair, though, you have and I am too groggy to run. So, I guess we’ll say you caught me and now you get three wishes.”\n\n“Oh, no,” O’Malley replies, “I couldn’t. I am just glad you are going to be okay.”\n\n“Nope.  Fair is fair and it is our code … I must grant you three wishes.”\n\n“Well, in that case, I sure do like golfing - especially on your beautiful courses here in Ireland - but just can’t seem to ever improved. I guess I’d like to play better golf.”\n\n“Done!” the leprechaun replied. \n\n“And,” O’Malley continued, “it would be nice to be able to have the money to play whenever I get the chance.”\n\n“You’ve got it.  And more.  For your third wish, what will it be?  Some help in the romance department?”\n\nO’Malley simply blushed.  The leprechaun cried, “Done!”\n\nA year goes by and O’Malley finds himself back in Ireland, playing on the same golf course, this time in a tournament.  As he was teeing off on the sixth hole, he again slices the ball into the woods. “Blast,” he exclaims and follows the ball into the woods. He finds it, and next to it is the leprechaun from a year before, laughing. \n\n“Don’t worry, O’Malley, you didn’t slice.  That was me doing that. I wanted to talk to you. How’s it going?”\n\n“Well, it’s great,” O’Malley replies. “My golf game has never been better. In fact, I am here because of you. My golf game is so good that I win every tournament I enter and qualified for this one, all expenses paid!”\n\n“I see, I see,” the leprechaun said, proudly.  “And the finances?”\n\n“It’s wonderful, O’Malley said. “Every time I put my hand in my front pocket, I pull out a hundred-dollar bill.”\n\n“Uh huh,” the leprechaun replied, proudly. “And the ladies.”\n\nO’Malley blushed. “Well, I don’t mean to brag, but it’s been pretty good. I mean, like every two weeks or so since I met you,” he replied. \n\n“What!?” the leprechaun yelled. “Every other week?  That’s my best magic!  I failed you!”  And the leprechaun began swearing and stomping and kicking the ground. \n\n“Hey, now, fella,” O’Malley said, “ don’t beat yourself up. I think that’s pretty good for a priest with a small congregation.”",

            "text": "A man enters a sex shop, looking for a new toy to keep his wife busy while he goes on business trips. As a higher-up in his corporation, he tends to be away from home several times a month, and wants to ensure his wife—who has a high sex drive—stays faithful.\n\nWhen he reaches the counter, he's shocked to see a wizened old man tending it. He asks nervously: \"Do you work here?\"\n\nThe old man replies, \"Yes, this is my shop\".\n\nStill cowed by this calm elderly man, the husband stammers, “...I…uh..I’m looking for a toy for my wife. My work requires me to travel and I want something that can keep her satisfied while I’m away. She needs to orgasm at least once a day and I’m afraid she’ll cheat on me out of desperation. We’ve tried all sorts of dildos and vibrators and toys. I’m at my wits end!”\n\nThe old man blinks slowly a few times, then says: \"Yes, I believe we have what you're looking for.\" He pulls out a wooden box, covered in dust. It looks ANCIENT. As he opens the lid, the smell of old wood floods the husband's nostrils.\n\n“This here is a Voodoo dick”, says the elderly man. “It has magical powers and I assure you, it would keep any women satisfied.”\n\nThe husband laughs harder than he has in a long time. \"Did you say VOODOO dick? HAHAHAHA I’m pretty hard up but even I can't believe you're trying to sell me this shit\".\n\nThe old man just looks at him. \"Allow me to demonstrate to quash your doubts. I suggest you stand away from the door.\"\n\nThe husband looks behind him, and with a quizzical look on his face, takes a few steps away from the door.\n\nThe old man speaks. \"VOODOO DICK, the door!\"\n\nAll of a sudden, the gnarled, wooden shaft lying dormant inside the box floats up into the air. It flies to the doorknob, then aims directly at the keyhole.\n\nA thunderous *bang bang bang* can be heard as the voodoo dick tries violently to enter the hole that is far too small for it. The door starts to shake and the hinges rattle.\n\nThe man says, “I'LL TAKE IT!”\n\nThe old man then says, “VOODOO DICK, the box!”\n\nThe magical toy suddenly stops and slowly glides back into the box, and lies still.\n\nUpon arriving home, the husband presents his wife with the box. \"It's a voodoo dick, honey\", he says. “This will make sure you don’t jump at the mailman next time I’m away”. The wife starts dying of laughter. \"Voodoo dick? hahahahaha, you must be joking!”\n\nThe husband gives her a stern look and says: \"Listen, this time I mean it. This isn’t like the rabbit or the sybian. This thing is for real!”\n\nHis wife says, “then let’s have a demonstration, dear” as she lies back on the bed. He then says: \"VOODOO DICK, her pussy!\" The lid of the box bursts open as the eldritch dildo flies through the air, directly towards his wife's crotch. There is the definitive sound of her panties ripping as the dick penetrates through the fabric, into it's designated spot.\n\nThe wife: \"What the…he....hey....ooooo...mmm...oh my god...!” She is shaking on the bed, and soon moaning and rolling around in pleasure.\n\nThe husband smiles and says, “I’m glad you like it! I'm going golfing with some pals from work, see you later, honey!”\n\nShe is too busy riding waves of pleasure to respond.\n\nA dozen orgasms and three hours later, the wife decides she's been satiated. She tries to remove the dick from inside her. She pulls, strains, tugs at it with all her might, but it won't budge. It just keeps up long away. She remembers that her husband used a verbal command of some kind, so she tried a few phrases: “VOODOO DICK, stop. That’s enough now! Turn off!”\n\nNothings working. She panics. Grabbing her phone from the bedside table she calls her husband. The ring sounds nearby.\n\nShe stumbles into the living room. She sees her husband's cellphone on the living room table. He forgot it. And he didn't tell her how to turn the damn thing off!\n\nWith the voodoo dick still thrusting inside her, the wife throws on some clothes, runs to the garage and starts the car. She has to get help.\n\n10 minutes later, she’s pulled over by a traffic cop for doing nearly double the speed limit. As he approaches this disheveled-looking woman who seems to be twitching oddly, he wonders if she’s on drugs. “Now listen here young lady, you’ve put a lot of people in danger driving that fast. What do you have to say for yourself?”\n\nShaking and wide eyed, the wife pleads with him, “officer...oh...ahh...I have a voodoo dick in...ohhhh…in my pussy…it’s a magic…dildo and…ooh…ahhh…and…it won’t stop fucking!”\n\nThe officer looks at her, flabbergasted.\n\nHe bursts out laughing.\n\n\"Hahahahaha, that's a new one! In all my years on the force, woohoo! Never heard that one before! Voodoo dick, my ass!\"",

He was worried about leaving Queen Guinevere alone with all those horny knights of the Round Table. So he went to Merlin for some advice.\nThe good wizard showed him his latest invention. It was a chastity belt... except that it had a rather large hole in the most obvious place.\n\n“This is no good, Merlin!” the king exclaimed, “Look at this opening. How is this supposed to protect m'lady, the Queen?”\n\n“Ah, sire, just observe.” said Merlin. He then selected his most worn-out wand,and inserted it in the gaping hole of the chastity belt whereupon a small guillotine blade came out and cut the stick neatly in two.\n\n“Merlin, you are a genius!” said King Arthur. After putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur set out upon his Quest.\n\nSeveral years passed before he returned to Camelot.\n\nUpon arrival, he immediately assembled all his knights in the courtyard and had them drop their trousers for a “short arm” inspection. Sure enough, each of them had an amputated little Johnny or one that was mangled in some way. All except Sir Galahad.\n\n“Sir Galahad”, exclaimed King Arthur, “The one and only true knight! Only you among all the nobles have been true to me. What is it in my power to grant you? Name it and it is yours!”\n\nBut Sir Galahad was speechless!",
