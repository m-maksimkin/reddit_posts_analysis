By the time the taste is acquired, most of our relationships are imprinted with alcohol and we can't see living our lives without it. For most, it becomes a psychological and social crutch because we started drinking before our brains were fully developed, and we can't envision life without it. We're convinced that we're boring without it. By the time we realize it's basically poison, it's too late, it's part of our life.\n\nSo the \"pretending\" is very subconscious, because we're essentially brainwashed into liking something that 90% of society consumes and is nearly impossible to call into question.",

Everything, fried, baked in an oven, grilled, fish stew, everything, and I never liked anything except one kind of fish that my mom makes (I don't know the name but it's some sort of sea fish, you mix flour and some paprika, you cover the cut up fish in that thing and bake it in an oven). River fish always have a taste of mud, no matter what you do with it. Sea fish is a bit better but I still don't like it except for that one example, fish is to be reserved for cats (DO NOT give dogs fish, they'll choke on one of a billion bones)\n\nAs for vegan animal product replacements, I live in a poor country and street food burgers (totally different from actual burgers but I don't know the right name for them) should be made out of minced meat, but the soy imitation of meat is cheaper than meat itself (the taste is horrible, 3/10, I'd still take it over offals but that's about it), so a lot of places buy soy and either straight up sell you soy burgers, or sell you a mix, just so they can shave off some cost because of taxes being higher and higher and our money being worth less and less (to keep the same price you have to cut corners). And I've tried some vegan things and compared to the real (homemade) thing? They're awful. On their own they're ok, but compared to the real things there's no chance on Earth I'd eat the replacements\n\nI swear, people that say they like sushi and vegan food replacements, I think they're either lying to you or lying to themselves.

Reluctantly, I began chewing, and before I can get it down it triggers my gag reflex and I projectile vomit this green/red emulsion across the dinner table.\n\nSince then my parents never forced me to eat anything I really did not want to, and to this day, just the smell of brussels sprouts cooking in any manner makes  me gag to the point that I just cant take it.",

Then, I got lambasted by three people who loved it. It was about that time I learned to dump it back into the pot when my parents got up and left the table, while making me sit there until I finished it. I'd go hungry first, before I'd eat that nauseating mess. I finally went on full revolt on that meal when I got to about age 15. I refused to even touch it anymore. A bologna sandwich was tastier, and that's what I had. Funny part was, My dad hated it as much as I had. After my mom died, my sister had mentioned to my dad about coming over for dinner when she cooked it. He turned her down, admitting he hated it too.\n\nAnd blood rare steak, or beef.
