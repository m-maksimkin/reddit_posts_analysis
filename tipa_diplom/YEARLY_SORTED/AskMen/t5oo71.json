Rather than check the pantry for existing items, it was an important part of this particular process to go to the grocery and buy the items needed and bake as a way to cope with said problem. This happened at various times by various roommates. I had acquired many items that were bought multiple times and left but this post is concerning flour specifically.

Because in my neck of the woods if you leave flour at room temperature in a canister or similar container, sooner or later it will be full of what in my family were called mealy bugs - I don't know if that's the actual name of them but that's what we called them.  They are little white bugs that apparently feed on the flour and they are gross, and if you get them and you don't want them in your food then all you can do is throw the flour out.  And I know some people probably would just bake them into the food and eat them but keep in mind that they have not only been eating the flour, but also defecating in it.  Yum! 🤮).",

I rarely ever had bread or all purpose flour unless I was specifically making something that required it. I DID however always have a container (and spare bag) of corn flour to make tortillas. TONS of spices and fresh ingredients to COOK with but did not bake very often at all. \n\nEven once I had kids, I cooked more than anyone else in the house but we still only had flour when it was called for and maybe some left over in a container till it ran out. It was never a staple in our house.",

When I lived in a crappy apartment with a small kitchen that only had a 2 ft section usable countertop space, I rarely used any flour because a ton of recipes that call for flour need you to have space for like 3 bowls, or somewhere to mix in the flour, etc. And all of my kitchen stuff was so packed together that it made cleaning up the flour a nightmare.

            "text": "I have a bag and know my way around the kitchen a lil. My family has a cook book so through the years it became important to me to be able to cook our family recipes. TBH baking is something I don't do a lot of, I prefer my cast-iron skillet, but I have learned a few things. I make banana bread (mom's recipe) with bananas that go brown for quick and easy breakfasts. I make chocolate chip cookies (Aunt's recipe, I have 4 aunts on mom's side) for when I had friends or a date come over. I make no-bake fudge (grandma's recipe, no flour but one of my favs) which can be either \"virgin\" or \"thc infused\". Another one of my favorites is my cousin's magic holiday bars(no flour but 9 ingredients). Oh! And my other aunt's famous chicken and dumplings (flour for the dumplings). I also make a cousin's pizza dough for cast-iron skillet pizza. And I do Christmas cookies for friends during the season.\n\nNothing says \"stay a while\" like the smell of fresh baked cookies or a hot warm meal that fills your belly.\n\nI'm also currently in the possession of a sour dough starter kit but am a lil scared of it haha.\n\nAlso... fellas... keep your flour either in an air-tight container or in the freezer so it doesn't get weevles. If you keep your flour in the pantry and it gets weevles and it isn't in a sealed container they will spread to everything grain based and you'll throw out a lot of food. Goes for pasta too, if you're having company and you go to pour your pasta into the boiling water, and it's filled with weevles... you've ruined the meal before it starts. Cuz that can kill an appetite. If you don't bake often but you got a bag of flour in your panty just in case... easy to forget about that bag for a couple years then BAM weevles.\n\nEdit: my mom just reminded me I make the best biscuits and gravy, great grandma's recipe! Haha! I buried the lead cuz I didn't think about it! Homemade drop biscuits mmm hmm. Slight twist on gg-ma's recipe... I \"baconate\" my sausage gravy, scandalous I know: fry your bacon (half pound) remove and crumble bacon and then fry your sausage (half a roll, half pound roughly) IN the bacon grease, stir in and coat sausage in 1/3 cup flour, start with 3 cups milk that you stir in slowly, bring to simmer on medium low heat stirring the whole time, add your crumble half pound of bacon back in to the gravy. At this point it should be about 25 minutes in and thickened up. You want a consistency of gravy, not paste or water. If it's too runny like water stir in a small amount of flour, too thick you stir in small amount of milk. Takes about 30 minutes in total... once the milk goes in you gotta stir it constantly or you'll scorch it. Enjoy!",

Oh and about 6oz of yeast.\n\nMy parents weren't really fond of cooking while I was growing up so I was raised on on food from the store's frozen section. I discovered my love, and seemingly talent, for cooking in my late 20s but I still had a difficult time when it came to baking.\n\nSo about 3-4 years ago (covid got me all messed up) I started making my own pizza dough with a hand mixer and it came out pretty well. Combined with my homemade pizza sauce and every pizza came out fantastic.\n\nFlash forward to the pandemic and decided to get a kitchenaid stand mixer. Now I started to use that to make the pizza dough (so much easier) and decided to start making challah and some brioche buns as well. Challah came out excellent, but like other have posted, I didn't have anyone to share it with.\n\nEnded up turning the leftovers into croutons, used some and vacuum packed the rest, and threw them in the freezer. Just took them out a couple months ago and they were as good as the day I packed them away.\n\nAs the pandemic wore on however I did become somewhat depressed and as a result lazy, so 2021 and I didn't see a lot of baking. I went back to Digornio and store bought croutons/buns. So those 2 unopened bags have been sitting for about a year.\n\nCooking, ie wanting to cook, whether you love it or not, is all mental. Im quite postive even the likes of Gordon Ramsey enjoys ordering out now an again. Basically what I am trying to say is dont force yourself to cook if you dont feel like it, it will only put you off it more.\n\nI recently entered into a relationship and my gf loves that I love to cook but completely understands me and my last paragraph.\n\nThere is the common saying of either \"Its made with love\" or \"The secret ingredient is love\" and that no lie. Without passion, love, interest, more often than not its gonna turn out like that mass produced factory version of whatever your making (Probably a bit broad but hope it makes a point).\n\nFinally there is no shame in not wanting to cook/bake. Everyone has their own interests and hobbies. Their own struggles and challenges. Cook when you feel like it. If you don't, don't. No judgement here.\n\nI personally don't like cooking much for myself and at the very least spending significant time to do so. But when able to share with others, their enjoyment of the meal makes it all worth it.",

Trial and Error. \n\n**Two**, sometimes you just need flour. \n\n**Three**, sometimes someone else needs flour. \n\n**Four**, if I’m cutting my dogs nails and there’s a little bleeding, I use the flour to stop the bleeding. It’s pretty effective. \n\n\nWell, that’s my Flour Sitch™️. If your single guy friend is in his early 20s, it makes sense.

At that point I could throw them out, but instead I bake banana bread. \n\nThere are a thousand easy recipes for banana bread on the internet. Aside from flour and bananas you need eggs, sugar, baking soda, vanilla extract, and salt. I also like to throw in some crushed walnuts or chocolate chips. Or both.

There really aren't that many calls for flour that aren't large recipes. You can bread and deep fry... oh, right let me deal with a quart of used oil, and store flour for another... *stir fries the chicken instead, still eats, maintains low carb diet*\n\nI literally bought flour because my mom passed last summer and I miss her bread and my dad wants a particular pie. And I'm only just now able to pick up her recipe book without completely breaking down in tears and/or rage.\n\nI have zero desire to bake 12 servings of something I have to freeze to keep for more than a few days, unless I'm hosting a party. I'll buy a bag of flour when I need it. I'll probably kill these two bags this month since I'll bake several loaves and pass them out to friends. I'm doing a low carb diet to kill these last 25lb or so, but I can afford a cheat day.\n\nI highly doubt your average male is going to bake anything remotely regularly, or *reallllly* need to bread and fry anything even remotely regularly - the only thing I can think of you can't just Sautee or broil instead is... catfish.
