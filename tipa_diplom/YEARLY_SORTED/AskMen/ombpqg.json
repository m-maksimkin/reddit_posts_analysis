To top it all off it even had a famous painting than no other than Hieronymus Bosch on the label.  I wish I could could remember the name of the painting, it was super cool. \n\nThis brown ale was no ordinary brown ale.  It had the flavor and craft of a Brown Ale that could have costed 10 bucks a pint, but it cost something like 8 bucks for a 4 pack.  I’m not sure why they stopped producing it.  I think I remember hearing something about the company not being able to get the proper ingredients anymore so they just quit making it instead of changing the recipe.  I think that alone shows how high quality it was, most companies would just substitute.  \n\nSince Tilburg’s Dutch is gone, I’m a pretty big Sam Smith’s Brown Ale guy, and I do love the occasional cider.  If you are into cider check out Rekorderlig.  It’s not for everyone, it’s SUPER SWEET, and when I mean sweet I mean SWEET.  You could give that shit to a 4 year old and they would probably just think it was a fucking Faygo or something.  That being said, I enjoy one from time to time, and it also happens to have awesome label design as well.",
