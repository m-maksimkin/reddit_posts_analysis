And outside her home she looked good, dressed well, etc etc \n\nLesson learned: if a person lives in a very disorganised home and in the middle of a mess, she might not be able to commit to relationship because her own issues are such a big burden for her..\n\nSo try to hang out at her place without her cleaning up before you come.",

She then collapses to the floor \"dead,\" while her kids are screaming and crying and begging her not to die. One was trying to call 911 and the other had picked up the knife and was about to stab himself when mom jumped up for the big prank reveal.\n\nI was speechless.

Shes really nice overall, but last time we were talking face to face, she admitted to me that she likes it when people 2 people fight for her, which set the alarms in my head on. I can go months without having contact with her, but she always contacts me wanting to do something with me.

My ex-girlfriend and I found that we were simply not compatible whatsoever, but by that time we had a son and were living together. My current girlfriend is the most wonderful, amazing, beautiful person I've ever known. She's my best friend and I've never had anyone in my life like her. We are beyond compatible.

It was selfish and awful and that realisation came all at once when I saw him looking at me and I realised what I was about to do to him.\n\nI'm not sure how, but I found myself at home, and somehow fell asleep almost instantly on my sofa, and when I woke up it was the next day.\n\nI realised that I'd survived my worst possible day and that no matter what happened after that, it wouldn't and couldn't be wise than *that* day and that whatever else came, would be better and that I could make it through.\n\nThat was 3 years ago now and I'm still here.",

At the time, and for a long time, I thought \"who could do this to someone sooooooo wonderful?  What a piece of absolute shit!\"  Fast-forward to what would be one of our last big fights before I moved out and filed for divorce.  At this point it had been 9 years of gaslighting, emotional abuse, manipulation, constant lying, and fighting over literally everything.  I had (unknowingly) been spiraling further into depression and was full of anger and got very, very close to putting my hands on her.  I wasn't raised that way, I never saw either of my parents touch each other.  They fought sometimes, maybe yelled a bit more than necessary but I was an adult before I saw IRL domestic violance.  \n\n  A few months after the fight I found out about reactive abuse, which is basically when the abuser pushes their victim so far over the edge they snap and become abusive themselves.  Between preparing for the divorce and going back to therapy I thought a lot about our relationship and how awful it was and how her abuse and my blindness to it almost cost me a lot more than 12k in legal fees.  \n\n  Back to the boyfriend.  My therapist was the one who spotted it because it came up in a session.  He said she probably pushed him too far too often.  There were other details of their living together and relationship that, in retrospect, were at least clues to her being abusive.  Point is, not everyone is the victim they want you to think they are and I know (because people have told me, including my kids) that she is spreading plenty of lies and half-truths about me and probably will well into the future.  Also if you're a guy in a relationship with ANYONE there is no shame in admitting you are a victim of physical or emotional abuse.  There are not enough of us out there telling our stories.",

I think I went to the gym or grocery store and had my phone at home to charge (what‚Äôs the purpose of a dead phone anyway lol).... So, I get home and no lie had 22 missed text messages and about 4 missed voicemails. Can anyone guess who they were from????!!!! Man oh man, I should have seen that coming. It ended up being about a 3 year off and on again, TOXIC relationship. Situations only escalated and got progressively worse and turned into a mentally and physically abusive relationship (from her to me). The writing was on the wall from very early on and I ignored them because yes, she was very attractive. But no person (man or woman) is that fine to compromise your safety and well being.\n\nI didn‚Äôt come out of this bitter or jaded at all. But I did learn that people are who they are and when they show themselves, believe what you‚Äôre seeing. You‚Äôll come up with excuse after excise to justify any situation and ‚Äúwhy or how things could have been different‚Äù. All you‚Äôre doing is enabling and perpetuating the behaviors. I try not to paint a broad brush and also like to give people a chance. So I came up with my own very simple ‚Äúrule‚Äù moving forward. When/if in a new relationship and a red flag pops up, that‚Äôs ok (depending on the severity). No one should give another a chance when physical violence is in play, that‚Äôs just my opinion. But when that red flag pops up use it as an opportunity to communicate with your partner about how that action or words whatever that ‚Äúflag‚Äù is effects you. Use it as a learning opportunity to communicate and problem solve. With hope you both move forward together and stronger. But, also make it clear that, that action will not be tolerated again. When/if it does (hopefully not) have the conviction to walks away.... It‚Äôs not worth it. There are so many wonderful people in this world who are sooo full of love and YOU DESERVE IT!!!!",

She didn‚Äôt like to communicate for what she wanted like a grown adult, instead she wanted me to interpret what she wanted and if I got it wrong, I was a bad boyfriend. She ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt wanna tell me what she wanted because a good boyfriend just knows‚Äù\n2. She had extreme separation anxiety/abandonment issues. I had a full time career that she didn‚Äôt respect while she was in college so she would bombard me with texts throughout the workday and if I didn‚Äôt respond within a reasonable timeframe, I got yelled at for being a bad boyfriend, because obviously my full time job was less important than her meaningless text messages. She also slowly but eventually completed separated me from my friends and family by telling me to choose Her or Them, which is fucked up cause I love my family/friends. \n3. She was more obsessed with her social media self image than the actual reality. It didn‚Äôt matter that she had just verbally abused me for 2 hours one night, she‚Äôd still get upset that I didn‚Äôt post about her on social media for all my friends to see how ‚Äúhappy‚Äù I am in the relationship. \n4. She was physically and emotionally abusive. She threw stuff at me, punched me in the face once, would scream and yell about random things for her whole building to hear so that the cops got called for a domestic disturbance, she would claim she would commit suicide when I wanted to leave her. \n5. When I did finally break up with her, she lashed out in anger and told me some of the most fucked up things you could tell someone you apparently loved, things like how she cheated on me throughout our relationship, how she was gonna sabotage any future relationship I have, how she‚Äôs gonna sue me for breaking up with her, how my family or I didn‚Äôt have enough money and there are guys who spoil her with more money, all this fucked up shit to tell someone you dated for 4 years\n6. She would broadcast any minor disagreement/issue in our relationship to her entire friend group, and lie about it so that she framed herself in a positive light and made me the bad guy. \n7. She sabotaged a new relationship I got into with a lovely girl who unfortunately received an entire essay of bad lies from my ex about how I was cheap and poor and a bad boyfriend and all this crap. \n8. She had a substance abuse problem and alcohol really triggered her bipolar side, it got so bad that when she got too drunk, I could see a switch in her eyes and she would act like a completely different person, flipped out at random people, would punch me in public and then run off into a dark alley for no reason. \n\nUgh that relationship drained me emotionally and mentally. I‚Äôm glad to be alive and out of it, and in a much healthier relationship now. Funny thing is, my mother was a pretty abusive person growing up so my therapist pointed out that the reason I was so tolerant of my ex being abusive is because I probably saw examples of my mother in her behavior, and allowed it",

We clicked almost instantly, so I figured ‚Äúhey, let me see if she wants to make this official‚Äù. The exact words out of her mouth were ‚ÄúI like you, you‚Äôre a great guy, but I‚Äôm still in love with my ex.‚Äù Me being the smooth brain Sinatra that I was at the time, decided I‚Äôd wait for her. Fast forward 6 months later, I‚Äôm still hanging on by a thread. We still talk frequently. She‚Äôs still calling me over to hang out. We‚Äôre still getting breakfast together regularly. And by this point, I had told her some pretty sacred things about myself. I‚Äôm thinking the horizon is near! I‚Äôm about to make this girl my girlfriend, I was pumped. I write her a letter( biggest fucking mistake ever) detailing how I felt about her up until that point. I give it to her at dinner one night, and I told her to read it on her own. A month passes, and I haven‚Äôt heard a word from her. I get a text in my biology lab(loved that class) from her, and it broke me to pieces. It read ‚ÄúListen, I don‚Äôt want you to ever send me any letters like that again. I just got back with my ex, and you‚Äôre disrespecting my relationship‚Äù. I was crushed. But I feel like it was meant to happen. Me and my fianc√© reconnected about a year later, and I‚Äôve never been more happy.

Every text was about herself, and she systematically ignored everything else. (She has a bad day, she demands to be coddled. I have a major cancer scare, crickets and tumble-weeds).\n\n2. Insecurity/control: she freaks out over the smallest things, and accusations fly at you fast and furious. (‚ÄúDid you just look at her? Why does your mom‚Äôs contact come before mine? Who‚Äôs this person, you‚Äôre sleeping with them aren‚Äôt you?!). Which turns into manipulation, gas-lighting and intimidation, and sabotage of all your relationships with others. \n\n3. Dark-empath: she seems very self aware, often works part time as a yoga instructor or health services sector‚Ä¶ but uses empathy and awareness to serve her needs at the expense of others, and often feels empowered by the harm she causes. This type is especially devious, and to be avoided at all cost.\n\n4. Self-deception: this is the big one!! If I find myself rationalizing her behaviour to myself and others. It‚Äôs not the same as standing up for her, it‚Äôs playing defence to unacceptable behaviour. This one is the surest, and most important flag.\n\nOf course, these behaviours go both ways.men are just as prone to them‚Ä¶ and often just as ignorant when we do it. Which means constantly checking myself and my motivations to make sure that I‚ÄôM not doing these things either. \n\nFinally, staying in these relationships only serves to provide positive reinforcement to negative behaviour, making me every bit as much a part of the problem. Best, most compassionate thing I can do is to be honest with myself, and then - tell them the behaviour I see, and leave. (ALWAYS easier said than done when the heart is involved. Emotional investments are not easily torn apart).\n\nFor what it‚Äôs worth, these are the bits of wisdom I‚Äôve picked up in my many decades of perpetual bachelorhood‚Ä¶.

You literally have moments where you realize how your partner started a life before you, planned for a forever with someone else and now has her own family that she is allowing you to be a part of only because her first choice didn‚Äôt work out. You feel it. I don‚Äôt care who you are. And I don‚Äôt care who she is, a woman that married and started a family will have given a part of herself away that is irretrievable. It doesn‚Äôt take away from her worth as a whole, but it certainly affects her ability to bond with you, in comparison to how an unattached woman would. \n\nAs for the ex. He came hand-in-hand with the child. The ex requires a relationship with your partner because they share a child. Basic logic. However, you can‚Äôt prepare for how text messages being exchanged, phone calls being made and even conversations had while meeting for the sake of the child will affect you. Then there are shared family events where all holidays involve the ex. Perhaps I‚Äôm lacking maturity or the right perspective in the matter of the ex, but he is labeled the abusive ex for a reason. Terrible acts were committed, hence the divorce. \n\nSo, for me, it wears away at something inside because when the moments of ‚Äúrealization‚Äù come, where you see yourself as an impermanent ad-on to a woman and her child and you see moments of life still being siphoned by her horrendous ex, you ask yourself:\n\nWhy?\n\nIn the end, we separated.

Then, she said ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm not sure how old I actually am, because even though my driver‚Äôs license says I‚Äôm 21 and I‚Äôve graduated high school, I was born outside of a hospital and my parents abandoned me, so I don‚Äôt have a birth certificate.‚Äù Did that make any sense?

Ya and all hell broke loose with that saying that oh I can hang out when it has to be about video games and that‚Äôs all I cared about (I usually stopped anything I was playing to talk to her and hadn‚Äôt been online in about a few weeks anyway and she could see that) relationship ended shortly after when I tried to explain how stressed and depressed I was about this whole dad thing then wasn‚Äôt sure if the relationship was gonna work which I then ended up ending cause one I thought that was a little fucked cause it hadn‚Äôt been that long but I really didn‚Äôt want to cause I genuinely liked her and had been dating for about 2 years.

It turned out that she was only interested in me because she thought I had a stable military career and that I could afford her the life she wanted of being a stay at home mother. All she wanted was for a man to provide for her while she did nothing other than put on makeup and cook terrible food. She didn't work a single day of the two years we were married which was a huge red flag.\n\nI also found out after the 16 months of so that she was incredibly racist and ended up having kids that she kidnapped from an Aryan brotherhood leader who's still currently tracking her down to get his kids back. She called me crying after 3 years of being divorced thinking that I would protect her from her own consequences.\n\nLooking back at it all, I have no regrets but I would have if I didn't walk away. Just like with everyone else, we had good times and went our separate ways. It's fun as a young guy to have a hot girl by your side, but approaching 30 changes your perspective as things slow down. I learned that you want someone you can slow dance with, the ride or die types. Feeling good and being happy aren't the same thing and I started really feeling that difference as my mid twenties faded. I'm now with a wonderful woman who's very loving, playful, wholesome and incredibly smart.

I needed to see them and she was nice enough and we got along fine talking a lot. She knew what I was about and teased me with her hidden watermelons. On the second date she let me play with them and eat her out. I didn't really want her to do anything for me. I ignored the assertion that she was in fact a wolf in human form who could use singing to kill people. Wolf-girl, if you're still out there, they were beautiful and I hope you got help. After I got her off and satiated my curiosity I decided that she was in need of help, not a horny dude and I told her I think I am a bad fit in her life. She seemed upset and confused but we never talked again after that. I still have no idea what to think of her but we both put our cards down and she got me to fold real fast after she told me she had a pack and they all sleep with each other. Problem was she was like 1 of two women in this pack... I think I dodged a cannon round by not letting my lust take over. \nShort answer, I ignored that she was a wolf.",

Went on a date with a 19 year old, had a good time..even made plans for second date later that week.\n\nNext day, about half way through my shift, some work friends started making comments about me having a new girlfriend.. now this girl and I work together, so I assumed she just told someone who told someone else.. well when I left, I realized why so much laughing came with the comments. She had written on my car windows with those car markers (erasable, but not the point). She wrote yesterdays date, \"Best date ever\", \"I love my boyfriend\".. things like that.\n\nShe was smoking hot, so I got over it quickly. But I should have known. Fast forward a few weeks, and she hooks up with a friend of mine that we work with. She begged me to forgive, and I didn't, and they started dating. \n\nI feel bad about it now, but she did hook up with me a few times to make him jealous during their relationship. She was brutal, she'd call him while we were hooking up so he could hear.\n\nAnyhow. I left that job and her behind. But I found out later that she ended up stabbing him in the leg because she caught him talking to another girl at work.\n\nGreat sex, but disaster averted.  We became friends again like 5 years later and are still friends, but she is now married with kids in another state and looks like she grew out of her craziness.",

Mom had many boyfriends with money and I‚Äôd never seen her go to ‚Äúwork‚Äù at an actual job; yet she drove nice cars and always had money. One day, hot girl tells me that she caught her boyfriend making out with her mom and that they broke up. In my mind I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúdamn that‚Äôs messed up, I can‚Äôt blame him though.‚Äù\n\nFast forward a few years... I‚Äôm 25 and addicted to heroin, about to be homeless (again), and I‚Äôve burned just about all of my bridges. Scrolling through Facebook I notice a bridge I haven‚Äôt burned yet; Hot girl‚Äôs Mom. (Sorry to refer to them as ‚ÄúHot girl‚Äù and ‚ÄúHot mom‚Äù it‚Äôs just so you don‚Äôt get confused.)   I messaged her and ask for a place to crash and she says yes. She‚Äôs married to a good guy, he wasn‚Äôt perfect but he paid the bills and he welcomed me with open arms. We all drink and talk, and I‚Äôm honest about what‚Äôs going on with me and the level of compassion they greet me with makes my eyes water. I‚Äôm truly grateful to them. We all go outside to smoke and he forgets a lighter and runs back inside; and Mom has had a little too much wine. (or so I thought) she leans in to kiss me and it lands on my cheek. Fear flows through my body and I back peddle. She apologizes and the only sound I can muster is ‚Äúshhh shhhh shhh. Shhhh.‚Äù As I dry hit my unlit cigarette. The husband returns to nervous chuckles. He lights my cigarette and I see his suspicion is his eye, but the awkward laughter he had returned to is never mentioned.\n\nThe night ends with them going to sleep upstairs and me going to sleep on the couch. I don‚Äôt sleep; I think. ‚ÄúWtf was that? This is a good thing, don‚Äôt mess it up.‚Äù\n\nAs I drift off I‚Äôm suddenly awakened by the husband rushing out the door for work. He tells me to have a good day and he reminds me that he‚Äôs happy to have me there. I hear his big truck leave the neighborhood and as it does Hot Mom is standing at the top of the stairs. She‚Äôs wearing a skimpy little camo dress that she was either sleeping in or woke up to put on. Husband hasn‚Äôt been gone for 5 minutes and she‚Äôs walking down the stairs staring at me. She grabs my hand and leads me up the stairs with her. My mind tells me how wrong everything I‚Äôm about to do is, but I don‚Äôt stop myself. This pattern repeats for a couple months, and as the days go by the husband‚Äôs suspicion grows and grows. It pokes its way out while he drinks, and little bits of rage spark out from him. He can‚Äôt prove anything and Her lies poison his mind; he rages at himself for being paranoid. Every morning he goes to work, and every night he drinks himself into a rage until he hates himself. The violence grows and I know that I can‚Äôt stay with them anymore. I tell them I‚Äôm leaving and going to rehab and it‚Äôs exactly what I did. Before I left he gave me one of his guitars, my personal favorite of his, and he tells me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt sell it for drugs.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt. I still own it.\n\nI left them to their devices, I couldn‚Äôt tell him the truth, and he couldn‚Äôt take her lies and manipulation. At the start of the quarantine they had been involved in a police stand off where he took her as a hostage. At the end of the day he let her go and they busted in with tear gas and arrested him.\n\nHe is still in jail.\n\nI am still sober.\n\nShe (as far as I know) is now dating her daughters ex (you know, the guy her daughter was dating in the beginning.)",

At first I thought what she was telling me was truthful and just really interesting.\n\nShe said her brother owned a Ferrari. Cool. Her dad owned a huge bowling alley. Cool. Her uncle is in the ***Italian Mafia***. Huh, remind me not to cross him.... Her dad owns a huge mansion in a really expensive neighborhood. Neat.\n\nNow, she was renting a basement suite of a house with her mom, as her parents had divorced. So I didn't see any of what she was talking about. One day we went for a drive around town and I asked to stop by her dad's place since I hadn't met him (we'd been dating for about 6 months by then). She slowly drives around a really nice neighborhood with multi-million dollar homes, points to one that has all the lights off and says he must not be home, so we drive off. I didn't think anything of it, just that he wasn't home.\n\nHer brother ended up moving into her place for some reason, and when I asked her about his Ferrari, she said he had to sell it for another reason I can't remember. Okay then, that's unfortunate.\n\nI asked about the bowling alley one time, and she said her dad had to sell it to pay her mom some kind of divorce settlement or whatever.\n\nAnd of course I never met her uncle in the Italian Mafia, and her brother didn't come off as well put together either. Families like that look out for each other.\n\nOne time we got in an argument about something and I was out with a few friends while she went to a party. Her friend texted me from her phone asking why I'm not talking to her, and we had a brief chat about whatever and I said we're just out doing different things and we'll chat when we're both free. Turns out she *didn't* go to a party and her \"friend\" was just her texting me pretending to be someone else. ***Big fuckin psycho red flag alert amirite***? \n\nWhen we broke up after about 9 months of being together, my parents asked if I believed anything she said about... well, anything.

She was also a very accomplished cook and was a very hard worker at her job which eventually led to a well-paid management promotion at a surprisingly young age.\n\nBut as the old adage goes: \"No matter how hot they are, someone, somewhere, is tired of putting up with their shit.\"\n\n**FLAG #1:** They started dating while she was already engaged to another guy who her parents adored. The very first time my friend met her parents, her father sat in his chair with a loaded gun on his lap and said nothing.\n\n**FLAG #2:** They moved into their first apartment together after getting kicked out of another friend's house they'd been living at because her immaturity drove that friend crazy.\n\n**FLAG #3:** Literally, the very first time I went to their new apartment to pick him up for a night of shooting pool with the guys (and also, literally, the first night he wouldn't be at home with her), it took at least half an hour for us to leave because she refused to stop crying about being left at home, despite a) my friend literally spending EVERY night at home with her and b) she was under 21 and wouldn't be admitted to the pool hall, even if we had wanted to take her.\n\n**FLAG #4:** She also insisted that he ALWAYS come to bed with her. No matter what time it was or however early it was in the evening because she had to get up early for work, he had to come to bed. If his friends were over and it was getting late, she stayed up, even if it meant only getting a few hours of sleep before work.\n\nMy friend had. To. Go. To. Bed. With. Her. RIGHT. NOW.\n\n**FLAG #5:** As mentioned, she managed a local establishment that, due to the nature of the work had a somewhat high turnover of employees. She would sometimes come home laughing and bragging about getting to fire people.\n\n**FLAG #6:** She hated to lose, whether it was video games or board games. When she won, she often gloated like a child and when she lost, she occasionally cried like a baby.\n\nThey eventually married and moved into subsequently better houses which they could only afford because my friend was paid very well by a telecommunications company that sent him all over the country five days per week, meaning he could only spend weekends and holidays at his expensive new house.\n\nHe even developed tinnitus from all the airplane travel, but it was worth it to keep her happy and in the lifestyle to which she felt entitled.\n\nShe, meanwhile, eventually started cheating on my friend at some point and when he found out, he drove out to the middle of the woods, put a .45 under his chin and pulled the trigger.\n\nIt's been over a decade since his death, but the lesson is clear:\n\nAttractiveness is secondary to trust.

I‚Äôm sure no one will read it, but if feels good to put this stuff out there sometimes.\nBack in 2016 I started a new job and there was a super cute girl named Amy in training with me. Up until that day I was very avoidant with girls I was interested in, but I decided I‚Äôm sitting next to her. Over the next few months we had fantastic chemistry and flirted a lot, but I ended up starting a 3 year relationship with another girl named Chelsea who started working with us later. \n\nAfter the breakup with Chelsea, I realized I had ignored many red flags over the course of our relationship, even at the very beginning. I resolved to not do that anymore.\n\nAnyway, Amy and I matched on tinder. We hung out downtown that night going to bars and stuff. \nI immediately saw some red flags. She told me she does coke occasionally. A guy she knew offered us free coke but I declined and she followed suit. By the end of the night she was telling me I was ‚Äúso getting laid tonight‚Äù.\n\nI spent the next few nights with her and we talked a lot about ‚Äúus‚Äù moving forward. At the time I was living in my car in the city Chelsea and I broke up in and was only home because my best friend lied to me to get me home because he found out Chelsea had married some guy she worked with and wanted me to be around my people when I found out. I had to go back to that city and live in my car for a couple more months.\n\nOver that time Amy grew really distant, but denied anything was wrong when I asked. There were a lot more red flags. She had very toxic friends, was drinking all the time sometimes to the point of blacking out, etc. I had learned to think with my head and take things slowly, but for some reason I couldn‚Äôt.\n\nI officially moved back home at the beginning of quarantine. Amy didn‚Äôt seem that interested in seeing me, but I did spend one night with her. She was sick and I brought her medicine, water, etc. I noticed a condom on the mantle in her room, but said nothing. \n\nEventually, after a couple days of not talking, I asked again what was going on. She broke things off with me. I was very hurt for a couple months and also shocked at how quickly I ignored all the lessons I had learned, but I feel lucky that she did break it off. I think she said she didn‚Äôt want a relationship or something. I would still see her around town occasionally. I found out my manager at my new job was her best friend, so I‚Äôd see her there a lot. We would say hi, but it was uncomfortable and I wanted to get away from her. The last time I saw her I was going on my break and she saw me and asked me to sit with her. I did and we talked for a bit, mainly about her life and work drama. She mentioned she had a boyfriend. \n\nThat was months ago and I‚Äôve dated other people since, but all the lessons really sank in after Amy. I‚Äôve broken things off with other girls or told them right from the beginning that I don‚Äôt want anything serious and to break it off with me if they start developing feelings, which has surprisingly worked. \n\nI do miss Amy and wish that we had both been in a better place in our lives when we reconnected, but now and for the past year I want nothing to do with anything serious and get very uncomfortable when any girls I‚Äôm flirting with or seeing start to express any type of ‚Äúcare‚Äù for me.",

            "text": "When my first stalker and I were dating and she started telling me stories that I knew couldn't possibly be true. We were getting pretty serious, overly quickly for very young people (both 19). The kicker was when she told me the day after she got the pill that she was ready to start having sex. TMO, I was still a virgin at this point, but I also knew that it took about 30 days for the pill to kick in. It was the last straw in a long line of lies that I was ignoring (probably not the best word to use, as I was pretty much racking them up in my head to be ready to regurgitate them if things came to a head).   \n\n\nWhile I quietly excused myself from the relationship, I did not realize that she was not just a compulsive liar, but obsessive once she had her mind set on something. She would regularly come by my house (I was living with my folks while attending university) unannounced, dressed to get attention - luckily, I was never there. Eventually, a few years later she left a number and asked me to call her. Like a sap, I did, and she was all over me like white on rice.  \n\n\nFlash forward 10 years and I'm now 2,000 miles away & experiencing a really rough divorce & she somehow locates my very new phone number and calls me. We start talking and eventually, I get a call from her saying she's in town.   \n\n\nNow, fortunately, by this time I'd learned my lesson from my second stalker who had the same sort of issue, however, she was much, much smarter than the first and her lies were specific to her upbringing and her family. It took me a year to start noticing problems with the stories and six months to break down everything & figure out she was lying (she was a cypher - super gifted in the area of language - spoke 7 languages and could sight-read music like no other musician I've ever met - became a linguistics professor after getting her Ph.D.). By that time, we were engaged - and that only lasted 4 months, because she had taken to lying about other things, too.  \n\n\nFurther, I had a toddler and was a bit more wary about people or unknowns coming into my life/home/general vicinity at this point. I then find out that my sort-of-celebrity friend was obsessed with her, so after warning him she was a little unhinged and giving into his request, I connect them together & he invites her to this very private club, where she proceeds to put her shirt on backwards while in the bathroom, start talking with an English accent and telling anyone who would listen how my buddy saved her life (total fabrication, as well). He called me the next day to tell me the story.   \n\n\nIt was a week later when her girlfriend (and I do mean serious girlfriend) who was the one putting a roof over her head for the past year called me. She asked if I knew where she was. I was honest and told her that the last I knew of her being in town had been a week ago. She seemed genuinely worried and hurt. She told me that I was a permanent fixture in her life that she had continually talked about (I didn't deign to ask what fabrications she'd provided regarding our few-months-long relationship).  \n\n\nTwo weeks later, I get another call from a stranger in New Mexico. She asks me if I know a (First Name), (multiple Last Names). I answer yes to the one that I recognize. She tells me that she had been living with her for a week and a half and that she had stolen checks from the bottom of her checkbook, forged her signature and cashed them, then skipped town. She further told me that she was wanted in several different states for fraud and usually moved on when she was close to getting caught. It was sort of shocking, but not unexpected, really, considering what a penchant she had for fabricating stories on the spot. I knew she was using her girlfriend of the past year and then jumped town to come visit me without warning. I told her everything I knew about her so that she could possibly put the information together and have the authorities get hold of her.  \n\n\nFortunately, this was the last occasion on which I'd ever heard from her. I think she may have figured out that I'd learned about her behavior and - knowing that I was working at a psychiatric hospital at the time - probably figured best left alone.   \n\n\nI did look her up many years later after the Internet gave us the ability to look up people's criminal records for a small fee. She had been convicted 10 years after that back in our home state and served a very short period of time in prison. Probably once she went back to visit her mom and the authorities wanted people in that tiny little town to let them know if she showed up.",

I was a stoner, rock concerts and fantasy books nerd, and she was a beautiful, preppy  party girl nerd. In the end, i allowed myself to be changed into something more like her, and lost a lot of friends because she was all i saw or wanted to be with. I was blinded by all the sex and time with her friends as to what was happening to me. \n\nIt all ended when I went to university in a country far away from my home country, and our breakup had everything to do with me leaving. We stayed together for a month or so before i realized, thanks to the absence of our rabid sex, that i hated who i had become. To this day, i really care about her and think she is a wonderful person, but i couldn‚Äôt spend another second as the person i had transformed into. But stepping out of that persona and back into being myself completely revitalized me, too. I became able to love myself afterwards in a way i never had before.\n\nI regret everything about how i broke up with her afterwards and the pain i inflicted, but i regret nothing about ending the relationship. \n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this and it sounds like a buttered up version of your experience, because obviously my recollection is biased, i hope this gives you some measure of solace or at least understanding.

For starters, I was friendly with her sister and she told me how their parents put her (girl in question) on a pedestal & she could do nothing wrong and anytime she asked for something, she got it: it could be a new phone all the way up to choosing where the next family vacation would be. Obviously, she (sister) was treated the opposite way. Simply put, this girl was given the princess persona by her parents.\n\nNext, she bragged about drinking and getting drunk underage. This was our junior year of high school and she acted like getting smashed was a quirky, fun personality trait for a 16/17 year old. It isn‚Äôt. All of her weekend/vacation Snapchats consisted of her speech getting progressively slurred and all of her girlfriends ‚Äúyass queen‚Äôd‚Äù her the next time they saw her because of her stupid behavior on social media. Btw, idk why, but Instagram recently recommended I follow her (I‚Äôm good haha). I checked out her account and she‚Äôs streaming. Some of her Twitch clips/replays consist of her proudly downing bottles of wine. She‚Äôs in her early 20s now, so she‚Äôs either trying to relive high school, is an alcoholic, or both.\n\nLast, every guy wanted her and she smugly accepted it. That should be a red flag for everyone when the person they like acts as if they‚Äôre doling out roses on The Bachelor. But hey, love is blind! Another fast forward, she must be trying to relive high school so much because, when I saw her Twitch recently, she had a link to her OF on there. She really can‚Äôt accept the fact that guys aren‚Äôt chasing after her anymore haha.",

Mind you, her friend group when we were in college was made up of some very repressed vanilla girls in who were jealous of her as she was so much hotter than them. She was an absolute firecracker who had just bad enough daddy issues to be a goddess in bed. Still the best 3x daily sex I‚Äôve ever had was the first year or so of the 4 years we spent together. A wonderful girlfriend and sweet girl until she wasn‚Äôt. And she was bad when it was bad. \n\nBut seriously she had no friends, my friends became hers by proxy, but I was her entire support system. She told me early on that she had attachment issues, I don‚Äôt blame her with a bit of a crazy mom and a dad who couldn‚Äôt deal with an attractive daughter once she hit puberty. He was a nice guy but old school and couldn‚Äôt maintain a relationship to save his life. The result, she would actively create situations to discard or break ties from people. But young me, enamored with her thought I could fix it. She was one year in school younger, the first person I really ever truly fell in love with. \n\nShe ended up cheating within a little under two years of us dating. We made it through 2+ more years after she went to therapy and promised to turn things around. Our relationship actually got better after that somehow but that was a nutty red flag. I will never take someone back again. I remember thinking it was a bad idea when I took her back, but to be honest I‚Äôm not sure I would have changed it, she was that sexy, and that good in bed, and I truly loved this chick. \n\nAnyway attachment issues were true. She ended up breaking up with me at the hardest time of my life, a year out from college with no money, no prospects, putting all my time into a startup that would allow me to move to be with her full time. I can‚Äôt tell you the amount of time, energy and money I spent visiting her at home and in school. Within a month after she graduated from a college that I loved and she hated (socially) she dumped me. She no longer needed the support system. Broke up with me in a different country too and made me drive her 10 hours home...\n\nTo this day I haven‚Äôt dated anyone else seriously. For years I was deeply fucked up, we discussed marriage and kids all the time. I was months away from buying her an engagement ring. My parents never liked her, her brother told me she was a bitch, I was in love though. \n\nOverall within 9 months of the end of our relationship she was dating a man 13 years older than her, they are engaged to get married. In a way she gave up on me because In the short term she couldn‚Äôt see a path forward where I could help provide for getting a place together. I was so broke and so green in my field at the time. She went with security trading up 11 years to find it. After all she always wanted a relationship with her father, she just replaced him with fianc√©. \n\n\nHer breaking up with me was the best thing that has ever happened in hindsight. I dodged the biggest bullet. She was highly manipulative, and very beautiful, I would have found reasons forever to stay in that relationship. I followed the path I was on, I‚Äôm still in the same field. I‚Äôve worked my tail off and now I do exceptionally well for myself and probably make a solid double or triple what her and her fianc√© do; more than enough to achieve the life we wanted. For fucks sake I went from barely scraping $20 together to in process to purchase a power plant the next town over from her a little over a year ago, fell through because of covid. \n\nHer loss at the end of the day but I dodged the biggest bullet there. She‚Äôs doomed to play out the failures of her parents (another thing I thought I could fix) people seek what they know after all. \n\nI‚Äôve progressed so much farther past the emotional state I was in at this point that it almost feels like a different life. Still think about her somewhat often, I don‚Äôt hate her and hope she‚Äôs ok, but she is a bitch at the end of the day and I do truly feel bad for her future husband, he doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs going to get cheated on, manipulated and probably roped into perpetuating a lineage of unstable and unhealthy family.",

That's a very big red flag.\n\nGetting calls all the time. Big long silences. Not making it look like a big deal when it obviously is...

But one event led to another we both became acquaintances and I added her onto my discord group full of friends to chat up with her even more using voice chat.\n\n\nFirst red flag is when she start trash talking about her dad because he said hi to her and it made her cringe. Told her that's not cool at least he is trying to strike up a conversation with her then she responded with \"you don't understand my family\". Can only talk about relatable subject instead of discussing about other random things. There are so many fun facts that I wanted to share but never got the chance to. \n\n\nLastly every time when we talk about other subject she always turned it into a debate by trying to be the \"I am always right you're wrong\" type of person. Casual conversation somehow got heated just because she ran her mouth with only the stuff that she read up online. Remembered randomly talking about how banking and economy works. Sure there might be some facts I didn't know of or aware of and I am willing to ask a few question but she didn't elaborate further other than saying \"that's not how it works\" \n\n\nI actually legit lost all interest in her after getting to know her. At first I thought she is out of my league but now I think I might had dodged the bullet for not perusing her further.",
