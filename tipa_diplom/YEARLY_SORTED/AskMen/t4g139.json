Women have such better range in clothes, they get full access to nearly all \"men\" clothes except swim trunks with no top(wouldn't fly well in many places) AND they have all the \"women\" clothes as we that men still can't largely wear without issues. \n\nI hope people like Harry Stiles and the general trend towards gender neutral clothing and gender acceptance breaks this boundary down more. I'm an older millennial raised by a pretty standard working class dad. Dude is awesome and wouldn't care less if I wore a dress, might shake his head and be a little weird at first but I know he'd get used to it and take my side if anyone was a dick about it after a bit because while he has his ideas he's not hateful. \n\nThing is I just won't. I'm too old, my style is firmly rooted in jeans, tee or a hoodie. Just basic midwest package. I'm bald, I like my beard, I'm thin but not overly feminine and trying to find a style that lets me have fun with a non-plaid skit (cus if it's plaid then its a kilt and fine for some reason) while not entirely ditching my masculine attributes that I very much like, seems like too much effort for very little reward. It would awesome to have a one piece in the summer, like idk but it seems hella simple and cool to wear. Shorts are nice so I feel like the extra room would be extra comfortable and I don't get why guys aren't the ones getting it. I feel like we need it on those hot humid days. But I'm lazy AF and currently living in Asia as well so def wouldn't fly evenly if I did decide I didn't give a fuck, would certainly no longer be employed and lose my visa haha.\n\nBasically to TLDR this whole rant, just acceptance of gender fluidity, letting me just wear whatever because dude fashion sucks, though Idris Elba has fucking style Idk if it's exactly MY style. Women are just so much more appealing and seem to have more fun with fashion which is largely ignored by men or just the same shit like blue jeans, suits and khakis.

It just seems fucking COMFORTABLE. \n\nI went out to dinner with my wife tonight. It’s a dress up place and it’s 90 degrees outside. My conventional options for dressing up are ONLY pants and ONLY a button down, long-sleeved shirt. (I guess I could wear a polo, but I’m not a fan and I don’t think that’s particularly dressed up.) My wife can wear a sleeveless dress. Sucks. \n\nWhen I told my wife this, she smiled and said “Hey, grand scheme though, when it comes to being a man vs. being a woman…” and I laughed said “Sure. That’s true. But a sprained ankle still sucks even though AIDS exists.”",
