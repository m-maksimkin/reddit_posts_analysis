It's just a fact for myself, and I would believe for nearly all men that physical attraction is a must.\n\nHowever, I find that physical attraction is highly dependent on various non-physical attributes of the other person. I have met women who I didn't initially find that attractive, or attractive at all, who had personalities that absolutely made me find them appealing over time, in some cases to the point of strong attraction.\n\n For me, women who were super optimistic and had a great sense of humor, in their case I found myself surprised by the attraction as I've been annoyed at myself at times for not appreciating a woman more who was clearly great but who I just couldn't find attractive physically, and thus never was interested in pursuit. \n\nUltimately to me(and likely to most folks) it's a gut feeling, a base notion that you shouldn't have to think very heavily about or try and wiggle your way through mentally - it just is there, and it is very dependent on personality. It's likely dependent on other qualities as well, though I don't want to overemphasize them - social status, income, etc are likely also having subconscious effects that may increase or decrease the attraction. I personally don't think those things matter a lot to me, but I do admit it's hard for me to imagine myself with someone like a Denny's waitress, though in some perfect circumstance I wouldn't rule it out, just seems nigh impossible - as I would prefer a partner closer to my education and work levels.",

If I'm not physically attracted to someone, I cannot date them, because it's unfair to them. I am extremely flattered that someone likes me that much, but I can't say I owe them a relationship, and I don't want to take advantage of her emotionally and then betray her later by revealing a lack of attraction fundamentally. That's hella fucked imo.\n\nSo while many people consider looks to be shallow, I encourage those people to remember that looks are still important even if they don't have emotional depth as much as other aspects of character.

We even got tattoos together (not matching, but we went with each other, and it was my first tattoo so she helped me get over that fear). But after 6 months of dating, the most physical intimacy we exchanged was an awkward goodbye hug after our dates. I had tried to kiss her several times, but my body literally would not let me. Her personality was great, but I had zero physical attraction towards her. I agree with other comments: attraction isn’t everything, but it’s definitely necessary for a romantic partner.

I think only way this could work if you are both fine with just romantic or friendly relationship, which is I think how asexual people deal with relationships.\n\nAt the same time I would agree that physical aspect of the relationship is just a small part of it.

I could sense that she is somewhat attracted to me but for me it was not the case as much - and also I had an ongoing history with some other girl from the past and could not grasp how it will end. Anyhow, I met with this girl from work like twice, went for a beer, whined about our days and customers and basically had a great time. She wanted to hug me goodbye and I slightly pushed her saying somewhat along the lines \"that I did not want to give her some mixed signals\". I was pretty weird about physical touch with another person in a non-intimate relationship back then. She obviously looked rejected but did not want to look it and something like \"we can hug like buddies but whatever\".\n\nMy story with the other girl did not end too well and I though this was finally over. In the meantime, me and my \"buddy\" from work were still working in the same company and given the opportunity to be on the same shift, we had a blast. Month after month I was just falling for this girl, because I dont know, our sense of humour was like perfectly matched and we regularly just cried laughing when hanging together. I wanted to show her that my feelings changed a bit but she still remembered that first time and generally got herself invested in some casual relationship with someone else.\n\nI did not like that obviously, saying that she is running away from something meaningful and she is just scared to commit to a real relationship. We stayed friends nonetheless.\n\nBut then she somewhat followed my advice and broke the thing with the guy she had and decided to commit to some other guy from work that was recently hired. I then made my move to show her that I am somewhat ready to date if she's willing too. There was also some crazy drunk party that her sister threw and we kissed briefly in the night but she probably didn't remember that.\n\nAll in all, she had some doubts, but I ended up changing jobs and she stayed with the guy who was also very protective of her and I was something of a fragile subject whenever we wanted to meet up or something. I had already passed on pursuing her but wanted to stay in touch because she was just a great girl. Turns out it was only possible to meet with her if the boyfriend was present as well and preferably in some double date manner. I was like \"ok I am not gonna flirt with you or anything, just wanted to update on my stuff and hear about yours too since we didnt speak in a while\". \n\nWell she either didn't want to meet or was not allowed to do so and I told her good luck on living in that golden cage that will soon transform into a sad prison with your insecure boyfriend. Even if I hypothetically tried anything on her, she would have to follow in order for something to happen. That lack of trust on her bf side was just buffling. And that was basically the last time we talked. \n\nThis happened during the span of around a year and a half and it was constantly ups and downs, me wanting dramatically and desperately to engage in a meaningful relationship and then backing off entirely like \"couldn't be bothered\". Quite unstable, but overall I am a bit butthurt that I missed the opportunity to be friends with a great human being.",

If it's something physical but minor most people will make exceptions.

Obviously, there's no such thing as a perfect partner. It's just a little TOO miraculous and unrealistic. We can all maybe even imagine a dream partner in our own heads but most likely you've never seen a person who actually likes like that in real life and it's a fictional character you imagined with all the physical traits you desire. Of course, you could find someone technically close to matching but never exactly the same. \n\nIf any guys experience this, the obvious answer would be to make a mental note of all those characteristics and find a girl you're attracted to that possesses all those. Probably easier said than done but if you allow the moment to present itself it's totally worth it. Try to expose yourself around lots of people and be real social around not only boys but girls of course too. Maybe your other male friends know you very well and know a girl and can hook you up. Anything's possible, and all boys want a girl just as much as girls want a boy they can date.\n\nAll in all, I'm not necessarily saying that if you do find the girl that's \"perfect\" for you then immediately you've found your dream girl for life that you'll eventually marry soon. If we're talking about girlfriends specifically, anything can change. So just be open and the opportunity will present itself, I promise you!",

But I struggle every day with this dichotomy: if lots of women are into me, there can't be anything really wrong with me right? but if it's only women I'm not attracted to, what does that imply?? It's absolutely maddening. I'm 41 and single, and have been almost totally dateless for about 3 years. People always respond with things like:\n\n-  \"you have a bad attitude\"; well if that's true, why can I land a date at practically any time, and almost certainly have that one date lead to more and eventually lead to a relationship? lots of women tell me I'm a great guy, a real catch etc. The caveat: I'm not attracted to any of them. \n\n- \"you're too picky\"; funny thing, I'm actually not very picky at all; u literally just don't want to date women I'm not attracted to. There is a subset of women who, no matter how hard I might try, I'm not attracted to and I know *from a lot of experience* that a relationship won't work. however, there are a *lot* of women I am attracted to. and all those women I'm attracted to look practically nothing alike!\n\n- \"just change what attracts you\"; this is rather infuriating and mature because -- *newsflash* -- is not up to us what attracts us. it's physiological and, yes, if I dated a woman I was marginally attracted to and we really clicked, I absolutely would be more attracted to her. but surely even a simple-minded person can understand that *everyone* has hard-passes. Imagine this: you say \"I'm not attracted to a person with bad teeth\". I could say \"well that which comprises bad teeth is entirely subjective\", which is true, but you know that there's a level across which you cannot go because you simply know that you won't be able to get past it. women say stuff like that all the time; \"I just can't date guys under 6'2\", or \"I just can't date a guy with no tattoos\", or \"I just can't date a guy who isn't super athletic\". sure, being that I don't fit the bill in any of those areas, I'm tempted to say \"well just simply 'become' attracted to the things that make me different from what you're attracted to\"... it just doesn't work. \n\nUltimately, I can say this: I absolutely have gone against my gut multiple times and tried dating women I was definitely not attracted to. Guess what? It didn't work. I've literally had women say \"well sex isn't everything; we could just not have sex be part of our relationship.\"  aside from the additional turn-off that level of desperation creates in me, I also don't have a choice in not being asexual, no more than I have a choice in being heterosexual. \n\nSo here I am, stuck between a rock and a hard place. Women I'm attracted to aren't attracted to me, and if I would just bite the bullet and accept being with a woman I wasn't attracted to I'd be dating again in a heartbeat. \n\nand I leave you with this: how would you feel knowing your SO was with you in spite of not being attracted to you? do you really believe the relationship would be sustainable? how about if, in honesty -- something also necessary in a healthy relationship -- they flat out told you they're not attracted to you?

Physical attraction is just whether you find someone’s body attractive. Infatuation is how that person makes you *feel*. Yes, the former usually influences the latter, but it doesn’t *decide* the latter. There’ve been plenty of incredibly beautiful and/or sexy women (like, 9s or 10s if we were using a conventional attractiveness scale) who I’ve met and felt absolutely nothing for, but the vast majority of my crushes probably fall between the 4-7 range. But the interactions I’d had with them established a feeling inside me where I was very infatuated with them.\n\nIf you don’t get infatuated with someone, I don’t think it’s likely you’ll have a passionate relationship.

Whether it be the little giggle she makes when you nibble on her neck or the way she laughs at a fucked up joke. The look in her eyes when she wants you. The way her hair hangs while she’s reading and the absent way she pushes it back. These little moments are made sexy by the way the women in question makes me feel outside of the bedroom. Sure, there may have not been an initial sexual attraction but after I know it’s going to happen I can find those little moments and build a full attraction from them.

I'm currently living in a dual relationship with two partners that have a mix of my needs and it's just... rough.\n\nI would say there are the following considerations:\n\n1.  Physical Attraction & Sex Drive\n2.  Emotional Development and Culture\n3.  Hobbies & Interests\n\nThese could all be broken down into individual groups, honestly, but for simplicity sake I'm keeping them lumped together.\n\nI have a partner who is almost 100% with me on emotional development.  We understand each other's hard times, the abuse we've been through and recovered from, the traumas and triggers, the need to recharge.  It fuels an enormous amount of compassion and allows me to recharge without spending time completely alone.\n\nUnfortunately, they fall short on the other things.  They are beloved to me, and probably closer to family at this point.  But it's hard to say they are 'just' a friend due to our past, our gender, and how most people perceive all of that history.  And they'll never leave my life because of their importance, despite all romance being gone and a non-factor.\n\nOn the other hand, I was 'caught' by an extremely attractive, sexually driven person who absolutely worships me.  And has 99% of my same interests and hobbies.  I warned them about my situation from the start, about my 'open' policy on relationships, my baggage and past, everything.  And they find themselves in this tormented dance of jealousy, and obsession.  And to make it worse... I've never had a partner who has found my so attractive and practically worships me physically.  Who I also, in turn, find incredibly attractive.  So it's a type of validation I thought I would never have in my life.\n\nPoint being...  it's just too fucking complicated.  People are complicated.  You're combining a lot of things... compassion, humility, settling, gratitude.. and sometimes, it's just total luck.  Finding the right person, with the right development level, at the right time.  \n\nSomeone may be 'that person'.  Some may 'become that person'.  Someone may 'stop being that person'.  The moments you spend with the right person, in a decade, may be hell and tragedy.  Just as much as investment in someone now may turn into something beautiful later.  People are complicated, constantly changing, constantly surprising you - for better or worse.\n\nI don't know if there's an answer.\n\nBut there are nearly infinite questions and paths...\n\nGood luck.",

All this to say, give it a shot. If your physical attraction stays stagnant, just be honest with your feelings and break it off.

I cared and thought about her more than id cared or thought about anyone before in my life. even when my friends made fun of me for liking an \"ugly\" girl. i knew i couldnt let her fade like the others, i had to act.\n\ni was planning to confess my love on valentines day, and ask her out to the vday dance. but, to my surprise, the dance actually came 2 days earlier. i learned about this the day  of the dance. so i grabbed the prettiest flower, wrote the best speech i could, and tried to collect myself as i waited for her to walk down her usual path. when the moment came, i fumbled the words, i told her what i thought of her but forgot to ask her out. there was no yes or no question, thus no yes or no answer. the response given was \"im proud of you for telling me\".\n\ni was absolutely broken, and confused. covid happened very shortly afterwards so i never got the chance to ask her what she meant. she ghosted me on everything and then moved away. the worst part is that i cant forget, as hard as i try, i cant move on.\n\n\nin conclusion, if you try to date a girl solely for her personality, you might find yourself lovestruck, but there is no guarrantee of success.",

I can still recall a friend of mine saying after a party one night \"When I first saw her, I thought she had a face like a donkey's bottom, but by the end of the evening, I really fancied her.\"  I can recall another night at a dinner party all of her friends trying to explain to her the magic \"It\" factor, and how she absolutely had it and all she had to do was ask a guy out herself and she'd be showered in dates; but none of us knew a word in German that approximated and she got frustrated because she thought we were mocking her...  \n\nOf course, she didn't fancy any of *us* so it never happened. I still think of her sometimes, and wish it had. And I hope she found someone who'd show her how beautiful she could be in *experience*...\n\nBut later, I have tried to date someone who was a good person, who I also didn't fancy, but the magic \"it\" factor didn't come in, at least for me. I went in hoping it would, but have regretted it ever since because for her it did. And it seemed to her like I thought more than I did because I'm not a selfish, but also frankly, a pretty damn good lover, so she fell *hard*.  She completely lost it when I eventually had to admit it was just exhausting me having to work for every special moment but I was never genuinely happy. \n\nI don't know if the cruelty was in the trying, or the leaving, but I've never felt I did the right thing there either way. It probably would have been better to have stayed friends until I knew I could be sure I'd explored enough potential emotional growth before hand.  Certainly I have always done so since.",

Now, I don’t mean to be rude, but she wasn’t a looker and it being high school, my beauty standards for women were pretty much entirely defined by movies and the like. Anyway, I was the nerdy kid, with little to no social experience at the time and I wasn’t the one to talk usually but I wasn’t a brat so when she was assigned to sit next to me I felt like I should at least exchange the basic pleasantries you know? Started talking to her, about not much really, just like the real basic stuff. Slowly we talked a lot more and  got more comfortable with each other. Suddenly, she wouldn’t bloody leave my mind! I’d dream about her, wake up and she’d be my first thought, go to sleep and she’d be my last thought. Now, I fell HARD like about as hard as a high schooler can fall. She could send me into a daze, that’s how hard I crushed on her. Never told her, left the country with my family after a couple years, the crush seems to have faded away a little and I’m not obsessed with her anymore but I honestly don’t know what I would have done if we had stayed. It’s a little scary being that obsessed with someone, they won’t leave your thoughts at all. I don’t know if it was healthy.\n\nShort answer, absolutely, I am the type of guy who could fall hook-line-and-sinker for anyone if they spark with me. I’m not gonna lie, I’d fantasized up a whole ass married life and together till we are old story.\n\nEdit: I don’t think I mentioned it but the longer I spoke with her and hung out with her, the prettier she looked to me. It’s creepy saying it, but I definitely had the urge to pump the car jack thinking about her a few times back then. I definitely became physically attracted to her after I started crushing on her. But when we first met I really did not find her pretty. I’d say, objectively speaking, the only thing she had going for her was that her skin was smooth and her voice was easy on the ears.",

            "text": "I've come to realize that having women as friends is a vital asset that cannot be ignored. I've never understood the concept of the \"friend zone\" as being a negative thing. A woman that has all the girlfriend characteristics but I don't like? **Do you have any idea how vital that is for someone like me?**\n\nLet me break it down for you.\n\n1) I am about as dense as a neutron star when it comes to understanding how women feel about me. I'm fairly certain that if a woman came up to me and explicitly told me that she was madly in love with me, I'd probably just blankly stare at her thinking about whether or not she's interested in a challenge round of Monopoly. *Having a woman with the ability to understand other women on my behalf is pretty much a godsend.*\n\n2) If I am in a relationship that is **extremely** toxic, I'd love to have a woman that I'm close to as a friend to be able to help me break out of my shit, because I used to be just like that. Just after high school I had two close friends who basically sat and watched for two months with one relationship where I was dating a verbally-abusive, alcoholic drug-addict who had separation anxiety and severe trust issues, and who used me to basically taxi her everywhere and stole a few hundred dollars from my bank account. It took both of them helping me to finally break free of that relationship, and this was a few years ago.\n\n3) Even if there's no situation where they'd be useful, one of the things I find attractive in a woman is friendliness and understanding of when I basically blow a fuse on random nerd shit. In a single conversation, I can go from talking from why you can blame 90% of the shit that goes wrong in the DC Universe on the Flash to why my math professor is an absolute dolt because he almost taught us the lattice method in a college-level pre-calculus course. **Even if I have no intention whatsoever of dating this woman, the opportunity to have someone where I can just have a conversation with someone about shit that seems mundane is an absolute gift from the stars.**",

We dated for several years but in the end I just couldn't see myself with her forever. I was never really attracted to her and I realized later on that that was the primary issue.\n\nThe second time was a number of years later. I was more attracted to her but still not as much as I'd have liked to be. She had a wonderful personality and was a fantastic girlfriend, but in the end I wasn't attracted to her enough to stay.\n\nThese two experiences showed me part of who I was and what I wanted in a partner. It helped me grow and learn from my past mistakes.\n\nI can't speak for anyone else, but my experience tells me that physical attraction is just an element of what I want in a relationship that simply cannot be compromised. Toward the end of both of the above relationships we were more like friends than lovers, never having sex, and when we tried, I often wasn't very into it.\n\nI'm leery of using my own experiences as advice for anyone else, but I still believe it's a cautionary tale. They say men fall in love faster because we're visual creatures, and while I again can't speak for any other men out there, for me, that does seem to be true.\n\nThe woman I've been most happy with throughout my life I was very attracted to. I have broken up with some very attractive ones, but my experience has ironically shown me that I'll tolerate more \"baggage\" and difficulty if she's more attractive. It's like a scale.\n\nI think in the end what works most for me is to find both a great personality and attractivity. You don't have to find the most attractive person you can, you just have to find someone you're truly attracted to - someone who excites you sexually. You'll know when you have that, because you'll want to be physical with them all the time, such as kissing, touching, and simply being physically close. I've noticed that the woman most attracted to me were very often much more physical with me, like they just felt compelled to kiss me frequently, to hold my hand, and all around just be close to me.\n\nMoral of my story is: Find someone you're attracted to, but also understand that personality is just as important. You can't just have one. One never worked for me.",

The next morning I even felt awful because I wasn’t attracted to him like that. But I gave it a shot anyway and fast forward a year later and he ended up cheating on me, and I even told him I loved him when it wasn’t true. Looking back, it was an extremely toxic relationship with many fights, many lies, and I learned my lesson. \n\nThree years after that, I met a guy who I was actually attracted to (like... I would get super nervous around him on our dates), not only physically but his personality was attractive to me. We have been together two years now and it’s amazing how different a relationship can be depending on the person you’re with. I’m happy, he’s happy, we flirt endlessly, love having sex together, and are deeply in love.

I eventually broke up with my bf, bc i realized i don't even enjoy talking to him over this guy. We couldn't meet for some 8  months bc of lockdown. Then he took me out on his birthday. We started going out more often. Till then i had fully and completely fallen for him. I wanted him in everyway and i still do, both emotionally and physically. When we're together its just hard to keep it in the pants lol.

Is it plain and simple sexual lust? In Germany we got a saying which translates to \"the grass is always greener on your neighbors lawn\", which pretty much means that you will always want the things that you don't have. That is also applicable to your sex drive, meaning: just because you love one person you will still always lust for others, but it is you deciding on a daily basis with what kind of person you want to share your life (which shouldn't be based on physical attraction alone, that is the least important factor I think in that matter. None of us gets younger and let's be honest: our bodies also don't get prettier so you owe it to yourself and to logic to look for real values in another person). And to your question: give her a chance, you might get surprised. But always be honest with her, don't lead her on. There is a chance that you will build a strong relationship with a lot of love and attraction should build up naturally. It might not be as intense in a sexual way, but very fulfilling.",

And in the end the relationship wont work out. Let me explain..  \n\n\nIt works the same way backwards. For example:  \n\n\nHypothetically speaking im gonna make a fake list..  \n\n\n \\- I need to physically be attracted to her  \n \\- We need to have chemistry  \n \\- She needs to have a nice loving personality  \n \\- She needs to be intelligent.  \n\n\nNow lets say i follow all that list but she doesnt check one of those.  \n\n\n\\- i need to be physically attracted to her ❌  \n\n\nIts gonna bite me in the ass later because that plays the full circle in me loving a girl. If that circle isnt complete the relationship wont last. No matter how you look at it.  \n\n\nLets go back to that list and say she doesnt check off another one, but checks off all the rest.  \n\n\n \\- She needs to have a nice loving personality ❌  \n\n\nNow im physically attracted to her. The sex is great. I love staring at her when we go out. But shes like mean to animals, or hates kids to the point where shes rude to them. **THAT ALSO** will bite me in the ass later on in our relationship.  \n\n\nNow we're talking about a girl that i would want to marry in the future here... Why else would i be in a relationship with her... What im saying is that everyone has their own personal list, and no one person is perfect.. everyone has their flaws and you look past that if you love someone.. But you have to follow what you like to a girl you will marry .. If we're speaking from a standpoint of JUST being mutuals with the opposite sex .. i can get a lot from different girls but i wouldnt call them mine nor would i want to pursue a future relationship with them.   \n\n\nFor example if we go back to the list and they dont check 1 of those things .. Lets say the good personality one .. Me and her could still be fuck buddies and both understand a future is not in our minds. We still gain something for it.  \n\n\n Now lets say shes attractive AND we have good chemisty but she misses a good personality ... well me and her could still hang out, play games together, go out to have fun together as friends but we dont need a relationship.  \n\n\nTo ultimately answer your question she has everything i want except being physically attractive .. if physically attractive is important to me then NO.. i will not pursue a relationship. It just scientifically wouldnt work in the long run. If being attractive is not on my list then yes i would make an attempt to be in a relationship with her.   \nIf its on my list but shes not attractive i would pursue an \"everything else friendship\" with her and i would never want to lose her but i dont want to date her and i dont want a future with her. No matter how you look at it if you arent following what you truly like IT WILL bite you in the ass in the future. You DO get tired of staring at someones face.. you do get tired of peoples bad personalities .. You can like and love the shit out of someone, if yalls chemistry aint 100% there, it will not work out nor will it be molded and forced to work out.",

And why not, if not?\n\nI understand that most heterosexual men do have other erogenous zones beyond just the visual. Meaning, even if a girl isn't visually arousing to them, they can be aroused in other ways, which make up for her non-existent visually arousing features.\n\nHowever, if it's a man that has no other erogenous zones outside of just the visual system (and such men do actually exist), then no amount of personality could ever make up for the girl's lack of visual appeal.

We ended up at a wedding of one of our closest mutual friends and were having a great time she was there alone and so was I and we were having a blast just hanging out and enjoying the party. Well alcohol made my anti ginger complex walk out the door and the longer we danced and hung out with our fiends the better she started to look. We ended up in her room late that night and had an amazing time. But it was really awkward the next day and the days that followed. She was interested but I got my complex back. So we decided to go on a date (alcohol free) and see what would happen. We had a great time and it was a lot of fun but I wasn't all the way into it. She was like one of the guys and there was no romantic thoughts at all. I did muster up the testosterone to sleep with her again, which was a mistake, and I felt like it was forced all the way through. It ended up hurting our relationship and all because I couldn't get past her weight and hair color. We are still friends but not like it was before. She moved on and married a great guy and I did with another girl but it's always awkward when we see each other.

She was slightly manipulative (took me a year for my stupid gullible ass to realize it) and she wasn't exactly the most attractive. Whenever she brought up her appearance, I never directly confirmed or denied anything she asked or said because I felt like no matter what I said she'd make me feel like a terrible human being. Now, she wasn't *fat* fat, but she definitely was overweight and had quite a bit of acne issues. I looked past it all though because I prefer to view people for who they are rather than their appearance, so I did whatever I could to dodge the question like saying \"It doesn't matter to me\" or \"It's what on the inside that counts\" and then I'd manage to shift the topic using that as a base, like using myself as an example.\n\nHowever this didn't work out for me when eventually she forced me to answer.
