            "text": "I teach anatomy and physiology to HS juniors and seniors. Here are some things which surprised them in our reproductive systems unit:\n\n1.  The scrotum itself contains muscular tissue called the cremaster muscles. These raise and lower testes to control how close they are to a source of body heat\n\n2. There are additional muscles, dartos, which wrinkle the scrotum and provide some other structure.\n\n3. A good deal of male reproductive muscle activity is involuntary.\n\n4. Precum or pre-ejaculate can contain sperm if there are any left over in the urethra and this is one source of failure in the pullout method. The proper purpose of precum is lubrication and flushing of urine from the urethra.\n\n4. Cum is mostly not sperm but other fluids generated by internal organs.\n\n5. Women don't have prostates. (I was surprised they were surprised)\n\n6. Generally speaking every structure in male anatomy has a correlate in female anatomy and vice versa.\n\n7. Testosterone is not the only or necessarily the most important male hormone, unless you consider it a class of hormones in which I say ok.\n\n8. Sex hormones are generated from precursor hormones and share features. Estrogens are not very different from testosterones considering the wide realm of possibility in organic chemistry.\n\n9. The presence of a Y chromosome is not truly necessary for male development (though it is by far the most likely). Genes occasionally end up moving from one chromosome to another and it is possible for the SRY gene (basically a switch saying \"if you are reading this, make a boy\") to attach to another chromosome. It will probably cause problems in future reproduction. This mechanism of genes accidentally attaching to the wrong chromosome explains a lot of \"weird things\" that happen in genetics, such as people with Down syndrome who are able to reproduce.\n\n10. The presence of an erection is not consent. Attractiveness of a potential partner is not consent. Men and boys are sexually assaulted and harassed at frightening rates around the world and IMO the only reason we don't feel horror and shame at the stats is because we are even more worried about women and girls (which we should be). Reduction of sexual abuse of women and girls should be a worldwide top priority, but so should it be for men and boys. It is likely that someone in every classroom in the school has already experienced unwanted sexual contact, and it is honestly likely that at least one boy and one girl in each of my classes has experienced unwanted contact. That was not a fun conversation, but a necessary one.\n\n10. Males and female manufacture both classes of hormones and the ratio of them is in some ways a better determiner of sexual characteristics than genotype/karyotype.\n\n11. Male contraception options are somewhat limited and attempts to solve this have not always been successful. Many of my students did not know about vasectomy, sperm freezing, or alternatives for male contraception. The ones who did know about vasectomy were often surprised that ejactulation is still possible and can be pretty much normal from the erm, end user perspective.\n\n12. Many students were blown away by uncircumcised penises. Which is atrocious.\n\nThis is a short list. I fully support K-12 sex ed (and anatomy/human body systems ed) and in my professional opinion it would likely reduce unwanted sexual contact, increase reporting of sexual abuse, reduce teen and other unwanted pregnancy, reduce STI rates, improve maternal mortality rates (if you think this comment was sad, wait until you hear about the girls who had no idea what a uterus is actually shaped like or what causes periods), and improve neonatal care.\n\nFrankly, I think society will one day consider it abusive to not provide this instruction to children and will look back in horror at how we spit them out unprepared into a meat grinder of a society.\n\nPeople should not be getting sex ed from Reddit. That is a complete failure of government and education and everyone reading this should be pissed that this is the status quo. Again, I had a majority of students who did not know they had had a medical procedure performed which removed a body part. I had students believing all sorts of myths about sex and pregnancy, including some dangerous ones.\n\nWe are not serving our students. Call your local school board. Make a fuss. Make sure your kids are getting educated. And no, having the talk is not sufficient unless you are a medical or educational professional.",

My partner becomes nonverbal when she cums, so she’ll tell me when to stop by grasping my hand in her thighs or pulling my head up and away by the hair. But it’s instant, it’s not like an engine that needs a cooldown, it’s “touch like this until I can’t take it anymore and then stop immediately or I will get totally overstimulated.”\n\nWith that context in mind, I had to explain to her that a dick and prostate isn’t the same. Ejaculation is *part of* the orgasm, but it is not *the same as the orgasm,* and if you go hands off immediately once the dick has ejaculated (like, perhaps, you would on a clit after orgasm) that’s specifically called a “ruined orgasm.”\n\nAnd that’s a fetish. Like, there are people who like being controlled and not getting the feeling of a full orgasm. But it’s a form of teasing, denial and humiliation. For the people who like it, *the whole point is because it takes something that is supposed to feel really good and makes it feel super frustrating and incomplete.* And I, for the record, am not at all one of those people who is into that.\n\nIf you’re working on a dick, and you want to make that person cum, you gotta keep whatever action you’re using going for a bit of a cooldown period after you see ejaculation.\n\nWhat’s happening is that, inside next to our asshole, our muscles and prostate are contracting and the whole pump system that pushes the ejaculate out is still running off the outer stimulation.\n\nThe first bit of ejaculate you see is just that—the first bit. You can’t just keep going to town or it’ll be overstimulating, but you’ve gotta clear the barrel and flush the system out by easing up on the speed and pressure slowly before you reach a full stop. Many dicks ejaculate in spurts or “ropes”, so…keep going. \n\nOur general rule now is “keep the motor going until I stop making noise or until I throw on an e-brake.”",

Being this gender and the perceived responsibility that is shouldered on us by society and tradition as tough and indestructible puts a lot of pressure on us, and to speak about these thoughts only makes us look even more like weak pussies so we stay stoic and bottle shit up which further degrades the healthy integrity of our mental health and instead we deal with this suppressed emotion by way of drugs and drinking and sex. I have old friends who have O-Deed, one had hung himself, and some still deal with addiction because they couldn’t rise above the machoism we are subjected to since birth by toxic male culture and media to be comfortable enough to talk sincerely about these issues either with a professional or other male associates because of the perpetuated false imagine of how a true man is supposed to act. In my opinion, this is the real reason some figures like Tupac is idolized because he was strong enough to show vulnerability in being real with his feelings regardless of what his hardcore male peers may think. That was truly gangster for his time. If women really want to be adored and appreciated, then show emotional intelligence and omit that BS mindgame line of “be a man” and watch your tone. You want to see our best? Give hugs and be supportive and patience and don’t always assume our job and purpose is to fix everything.

The veins that usually take blood away from the genitals restrict, trapping blood there and causing an erection.\n\nAfter ejaculation, or if a person ceases to feel aroused, the blood vessels return to their usual size, together with the swollen penis and testicles.\"  \n\nin my case i can experience uncomfortable testicular swelling independent of the erection, since i was a teenager, from getting turned on over a prolonged period of time without release.  \n\nsometimes i wonder if the dating is even worth the blue balls.  it doesn't always happen and the severity varies.   \n\nfor those that are going to say see a doctor, what does a doctor do for swollen testicles?   \n\nhow i deal with it:\npainful and frustrating jack off with a half limp dick, hot bath to try to get blood vessels dilated.  about half the time the attempt to ejaculate fails when swelling is significant.  \n\nattempt to rub one out ahead of time if i anticipate an issue, but it seems creepy if we're sharing space for a prolonged time and i'm in the bathroom masturbating.",
