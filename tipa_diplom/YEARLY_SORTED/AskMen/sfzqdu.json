I realized I was no longer was sexually attracted to her as the surgery is violent to her appearance and it wasn‚Äôt done from an illness so sex dropped to about 1/10th of what it was if that. She originally claimed the pain was debilitating but later admitted that it was to fit into ‚Äúcuter clothes‚Äù and that she went heavy on the pain complaint so insurance would pick it up and she feared they wouldn‚Äôt. Afterwards, oddly enough, she actually did develop back pain like many of us do so the complaining about it mostly fell on deaf ears as supposedly this surgery was to originally solve her discomfort issue.  Ultimately the dishonesty for her sense of vanity was really pretty disgusting to me. No sex from there meant essentially no communication. From there we went from married couple to more like siblings or just room mates. Relationship over. Having been away from her awhile now I do miss her at times but I‚Äôm also grateful to be away from her narcissism. \n\n  I‚Äôve shared this before to get hit with a wall of angry women regarding ‚Äúobjectification‚Äù or ‚Äúfetish‚Äù etc‚Ä¶ (or worse guys coming at me representing all of woman-kind and defending their honor)  I‚Äôm ok with this moniker as I think we all, men and women, have their *thing*.

No. But if a man is mainly attracted to a body part I think that‚Äôs pretty normal as well. In my case I just couldn‚Äôt fake being sexually attracted to my partner. We split on friendly terms.",

And, to put thing into perspective in terms of timelines, when I say \"after we got married\" I mean the day of the wedding. To give some hard data, we didn't have sex the night of the wedding.\n\nAnyway.\n\nWhen we were dating it was great, once we got married, it sucked. I am madly in love with her, but after 7 years of that, I filed for divorce.\n\nI dated a bit and then, somehow, I got married again. My second wife was very pretty, very smart (wife #1 was not too bright), the whole package.  Well, we got divorced as well, I wanted out because I wanted more out of life and I wanted to live a little.  Looking in retrospect I was mistaken, but - like they say - life makes sense when we look back at it, but we can only live it going forward.\n\nAnd that's when I dated a lot of women, and three of them were drop dead gorgeous, solid 10.  Model-like features, gym forged hardbodies, great sex, the works.  But each time, after a few months, I found myself being with them only because of the looks, very shallow of me, I know. And because of their looks putting out with a lot of crap in the relationship that - at the end - it was not worth it.\n\nThese days I am dating someone who is very much like wife #2: very pretty, smart AF, good sex, and.. for the first time in my life I am not attracted at all to women's looks/features. Don't get me wrong, I am not into ugly women, LOL. but when looking at Instagram reels and I get served with some of those IG influencers... I don't see anything special, and I am actually having fun reading the top comments and I cringe, and I wonder who's more cringy: the commenters or the influencers?\n\nSo, there it is.

We were both divorced with no kids.  I think maturity helped us.  We both established our requirements and I forced communication.  I said that I wanted a partner and a copilot, not a passenger.  She said she wanted to have a family/2 kids (I wanted none) and a man she could rely on (her ex wouldn't pay the bills and lie about it until the power was shut off).  At the end of the day her looks tipped the scales for me taking a risk but I made the choice based on a lot of other information.  \n\nI can happily say that we are doing great.  We communicate and we compromise on things.  We sometimes fight but we laugh and joke alot more than anything else.  She expects me to financially keep my word and take care of the bills and she is (and wants to be mind you) a modern 50s housewife.  She runs our house and sets the expectations for our daughter and the baby we are expecting in a few months.  I would never have expected this would have been my life but its really great.

I started talking to her because of her looks, not going to lie. But found out later she was a Star Trek nerd at the time. A big reader too. She was also kind of introverted. But yes, I was attracted by her looks. \n\nWe were married just 3 months later. Had only known each other for 3 months. Married in front of a judge. \n\nThat was 31 years ago, and we're still married. Our looks have waned, as they often do, but we're still together and we're still happy.\n\nEDIT: Didn't think this was blow up like it has. I see that some were saying this had nothing to do with the question. Sorry that I didn't clarify. It was only later that I found out about what she was into. At first it was total looks. We had only known each other for 3 months before marrying, so MANY of the things that learned about her were after we had married. I do not advocate doing this though, as it very easily could have gone the other way in that we had zero in common. This was pure luck. But make no mistake, in my eyes I saw was long blonde hair and killer body at first. Everyone I knew said I was insane marrying someone I hardly knew. \"She gorgeous, but you know nothing about her\". Had one work friend say \"did you ever think why she's single but she looks like that? There's something wrong there\". There wasn't.",

She would have episodes that made no logical sense. Hating me for no reason one day  then putting me on a pedestal the next, accusing me of trying to bang her friends and vice-versa, constantly going through my phone and social media, a slew of double-standards, and constantly feeling abandoned. She was diagnosed as bipolar that she knew about before we dated, but never disclosed to me. My unprofessional opinion is that she has BPD, or it's comorbid with her bipolar disorder. After she told me, all her wild ass behaviors made sense. \n\nWe dated off and on for three years, but the time we spent together was *the most toxic times of my life*. She ended up putting my physical well being in danger, threatened to call the cops to lie that I was beating her, and the final straw was when she hit me.\n\nI learned a lot about myself in those three years.",

She was a Slovakian volley ball player who was very fit, had a very thick feminine accent, aggressively hot in the face, and an ass that could give half the people in a mall whiplash as if it just didn't belong on a girl that slender. She didn't have much of a bust, but her ass would turn normal panties into thongs after a few steps. She was very grounded for a girl that was a 9 on the roughest day of the month, but make no mistake, I married her to lock her down and every guy around knew it. Even my battalion commander saw her picture in my locker during inspection, looked at my wedding ring and then at me and said \"you lucky bastard\", like he forgot he was a senior officer for a moment.\n\nYeah, that marriage didn't last three years. After awhile, it became very obvious that we were into each other just for our looks and I felt very lonely when I was around her. It was the most insane ego booster I've ever had and I felt like a king most of the time, but it never replaced the sadness of not having a true partner. To add insult to the situation, I discovered that she was using me to provide a stable household in which she'd be a stay at home mom. She just wanted to be the +1 to a man who would multiply with her and fulfill her projected purpose.\n\nShe's now single with two kids she had with a gangster and she ended up running off with them, leaving him behind. She called me crying and profusely apologizing for divorcing me because I wanted more than her bare minimum. The guy, who I had befriended in sharing concerns about her behaviors, contacted me later on wondering where she was and all I knew was what he told me. I know he wouldn't hurt her, but I never spoke to her between finalizing our divorce and hearing her cry over the phone. I was sitting on my then girlfriend's couch, living my best life and happy as a clam, to hearing her lose her shit and begging me to come back to her.\n\nLuckily I was smart enough at that time to say no, appreciating the lessons learned, and moving on to better and healthier things. I'm now with the prefect partner for me and I couldn't be happier. She's a super sassy pain in my ass who throws fuzzy dog toys at me when we \"fight\" and I'm smiling like an idiot just texting it out. She's the ride or die type who who will give you all her love while trying to not make it too obvious. She'll fake gag when you do something romantic and then she'll curl up into you during a movie with a cute little \"I love you\".",

Slender, big breasts, long red hair, and he constantly told me how sexy/hot I was. \n\n\nFailed to mention he was already married until he proudly showed me the divorce petition and said his wife had ‚Äúgiven up‚Äù and he wasn‚Äôt into her anymore. I was young and dumb and enchanted by the idea I was somehow ‚Äúwinning‚Äù this interesting older guy. I had a tough childhood with a narcissistic family, I didn‚Äôt love myself, and the attention was intoxicating. \n\n\nFast forward 7 years. Our relationship hadn‚Äôt been good in years, we weren‚Äôt intimate at all for the last 12-18 months - I joked to a friend shortly before the end that we made great roommates. But my career was progressing nicely, the tables had turned and I was more in-desire professionally than he at this point. I was gaining confidence for the first time in my life. \n\n\nBut he was 12.5 years older and in his 40‚Äôs, I think he thought the relationship was an expression of his ‚Äòmanliness‚Äô. There NO way he could have thought it was ideal, just didn‚Äôt want to start over. He seemed to relish showing me off to coworkers and friends, always talking about my professional life or appearance, nothing deeper than surface level. \n\n\nWhen I met his boss for work purposes, he was sure to coach me on how to act to best reflect on him so he could (somehow?) leverage my success and our connection to get a raise. I .. still don‚Äôt understand that - we were in the same industry, but separate specialties. \n\n\nWhen I embarrassed him by overindulging at a bar-hop with people that happened to be MY coworkers, he kicked me out of an Uber, near blackout drunk in a seedy downtown area of a strange city, with no jacket or phone. I damn near laid down in a door alcove to sleep, but managed to realize I had my wallet and stumbled around until I found a main road and a traditional cab to take me to our hotel. When I finally showed up, he just grunted at me. In the morning, I apologized for getting drunk and he made me promise to never put him in that position again. Because he couldn‚Äôt imagine the fallout if his boss found out how embarrassing I am. He also said he was disappointed because he‚Äôd bought me all those drinks and didn‚Äôt get sex out of it. \n\n\nAnyway, I was the one to back out when I realized that I wasn‚Äôt getting cold feet, I just legitimately started to panic at the idea of spending the rest of my life as a token talking point to bolster his own sense of accomplishment. \n\n\nSo I left, he went crazy and stalked me, started dating and living with another woman within a year (it took him 5 to move in with me) while still emailing me weekly about how he was going to ruin my life. Told everyone I cheated on him (untrue) to give a ‚Äúreason‚Äù because he refused to meet to talk about the relationship after I moved out, always citing he wasn‚Äôt in a ‚Äúgood place to talk‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt see the red flags until I left; beyond being an object, he had encouraged toxic codependency, isolated me from friends and family, hidden $75K of financial trouble, and in 7 years, barely finalized his divorce 2 months before we were to be married. \n\n\nThen he mixed heart meds and booze and died. He‚Äôd been doing it for years, convinced the warning on the bottle couldn‚Äôt ever mean it was dangerous for HIM. \n\n\nI felt guilty only for being relieved. It took therapy to realize that‚Äôs okay, too. Had I gone through with the wedding, I would have close to $100K in debt and that whole situation to deal with myself. I‚Äôm legitimately sorry his new gf had to go through that, but I‚Äôm not sorry it wasn‚Äôt me. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs been a few years. Now I‚Äôm with a wonderful man that would love me just as much if I was dumb as a stump and wore nothing but canvas sacks. \n\n\nThis may only be tangentially related to the question asked, but I know plenty of women and men that have been victims of abuse without even knowing. So if my story helps anyone realize they‚Äôre in a bad situation, this is your sign to get out while you can. Don‚Äôt get married because you think you should, or it‚Äôs the ‚Äúright time‚Äù, or you think you‚Äôll never do any better. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs okay to be selfish sometimes, and you deserve someone that lifts you up every day. You are loved, and you deserve love. Just make sure you love yourself first.",

Marriage lasted about 7 years, and the last 5 of those were miserable and took 1 year to finalize divorce. I think that being reminded she was beautiful her whole life and getting special treatment as a result of that messed her up. She was a model when we met and attracted attention from everyone because she was lit up the room with her beauty. Older men would approach us and tell me how lucky I was, how beautiful she was, etc. \n\nUntil.. I realized she was insanely jealous which meant I would interrogated for any suspicious behavior, direction I was looking, or how I greeted any female. I gave her zero reason to feel this way. Simple stuff like if I took \"too long\" at the gym or coming home from work would turn into heated arguments. For example, she once sent me to help her divorced female neighbor friend move some heavy boxes. I obliged and was gone 20 min because I was also asked to also help rearrange some living room furniture. When I returned she was convinced I had messed around and I had dishes and decor thrown at me while I tried to reason with her. I am athletic and can handle myself so I locked myself in the bathroom because I didn't want to lose my temper; I was so confused and lost. Eventually she would calm down and the conversation would result in her making me feel that I did something wrong and it was my fault for the way she felt. So many stories to tell but I was physically and emotionally abused until one day I woke up. So yeah, never judge a book by its cover.\n\nI believe fighting and making up was her way of feeling wanted. Her family was this way but I was too young to see the connection. Her dad was a womanizer. Her brother was the same.\n\nThis was 15 years ago. Last I heard she's been divorced (maybe 2x), has kids from multiple men, and is still a single mom.",
