I enjoy taking care of my hygiene: skin care, shaving, showers, and fixing my hair to look how I want it too. I enjoy lazy days outside of the productive state of mind. I know there can be societal pressures/standards regarding masculinity, but I don’t think anyone should be embarrassed about the things they enjoy, even if they don’t fit into the common belief of what masculinity is and what it entails. Things I’m “afraid” to tell others? Once again we shouldn’t be afraid to talk about what we enjoy, although it may in fact be wiser not too in some settings. For example, I enjoy sacred plants, such as cannabis, salvia, and mushrooms, but I wouldn’t just openly volunteer that information in most professional scenarios, as the negative social stigma and legality issues surrounding could open the door to negative, real life consequences. I would, however, still answer honestly and confidently if I was directly asked, in a professional setting, what my thoughts are on this subject.",

            "text": "OH, I got one. Writing. I LOVE creating new worlds, characters and stories. However, I hate letting anyone read my things. One of my early stories is so bad. Just look at random edgy 12 year old OC character backstory they made and you'll know how bad.\n\nAlthough, I showed the story to a very good friend while I was in recruitment. I got alone in a room with him to even show it.  Another comrade came by the door, saw us together around the book and joked about saying: \"Try not to make a too much noise ;) Some of us wanna sleep.\" Good guy, I accidentally pissed him off tho with \"mom\" joke. Didn't mean too offend, but we made peace afterwards. Anyway, I picked a specific exert that wasn't what I considered awful at the time and showed it to him. Do you know how good ti feels to have someone interestingly read your story right in front of you. At the same time tho, it's quite anxious. Ruminating on all the potential criticisms going on his head. As bad as the criticisms may be, I knew truly that I had to face them if I ever wanted to be good at the art of writing and story telling. After some long few minutes, he faced me with happiness and even started to discuss how, he personally, viewed each character's motivations and actions. I was happy but not ecstatic because I think to myself I can always do better or that someone can do what I so hardly try to do with no effort. Ever since he has been telling me to not waste  potential and talents. Honestly, writing is fun but it's not a safe bet for a job. It simply isn't, it's so hard to establish yourself publicly as a story teller.\n\nContinuing, after the few remaining days of recruitment, seems other comrades took interest as well. They were impressed, for some reason, of the fact that I was writing on a notebook a story in English. Alright fine, for some context, we're in Portugal so they kinda found that out of the ordinary. After recruitment was done I was transferred permanently to my home city of Lisbon due to my high grades in recruitment thankfully. Once assigned to a base, I brought the book to write and pass time during sentry duty. They're quite boring and very long-lasting. Again, I got the same impression from everyone in the base, always asking what I wrote. But I never opened up to them what I wrote about. Although I found it strange for them having so much interest.\n\nAs for the story, I shelved it, still have the notebook. May have some potential to it but I can't seem to work much with how much I limited it. Personal and authentic drama is something I need to work on. Currently working on a WH40K story that is inspired by a long roleplay campaign I had. It's going slowly. I keep showing to my mates, they like it. But I always feel like it's not enough or it'll never be good enough. Always puts me off writing the fact that I simply am never satisfied with I'm writing. I end up taking long breaks in between times of writing because I'm so embarrassed to continue. It's more of a situation of anxiety tho.\n\nThanks for reading this long text if you did. Have a good one.",

I don't spend a lot of money, and her room is surprisingly...non-sexual. We mostly just shoot the shit and play music that people in the room pick. Sure we all throw a tip every once in awhile, but it's honestly more to keep our friend in her job so we can all continue to hang out. Only twice in the past few months has she done a \"cum show\" and it was more adorable than sexual. She was so nervous she demanded the regulars let her watch their cams cause \"If you're gonna watch me jerk off then you better let me watch you so it's less weird.\" On night's when she's not working, we just chill together in discord. I was recently raising money with a GoFundMe for a friend of mine, and she threw in a significant donation.\n\nI should note I realize my experience is unique; most other cam girls I've even taken a look at are there 100% to be sexual to make money. Sure you can be friendly with them and everything, but they're not really there to be social. I actually feel quite lucky to have found a chill group of friends in such an off-kilter place.",

Secretly because I paid my rent hustling many times and there are places in Tuckahoe, the Bronx and Yonkers NY that I still would not go back to today. I have practiced trick shots, bank shots, and using English on the ball longer than most redditors have been alive. \n\nI'm oddly embarrassed to admit this and I hate when people brag or shit talk. There are so few pool tables around these days that almost no one knows how good I am. When I do get to play, unless someone starts talking shit, or I've been drinking, I play to their level. Talk shit while I've been drinking and I will hustle you hard and when you catch on and accuse me, I'll rack the damn table and offer double or nothing. If you take the bet,I will rack the damn table while making Kung Fu movie fight sounds (I am so not joking, I do this every time and I couldn't stop myself if I wanted to). \n\nYou have to realize how out of character this is for me these days. I'm a father, husband, business owner, have been elected to two different local government positions and am fairly involved in my local community.

It just means that I enjoy being naked, and that I do it as long as it’s safe, nobody will be uncomfortable with it, and it’s 100% legal.\n\nIn practical terms, I’m naked in my own home and at very specific locations tailored to nudists (such as nude beaches, hot springs, and resorts).\n\nI do not see nudity as an inherently sexual thing. Rather, I think that it is the default state of all people. It is only seen as “promiscuous” because society deems it so. \n\nI also believe that, assuming informed consent and agreement about the non-sexual nature of nudity on all sides, there is nothing wrong or weird with being nude around family, friends, strangers, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, this idea is a hard sell for many people. Most people are not comfortable in their own bodies. It’s hard to convince somebody who is only nude in the shower or when having sex that nudity can be both comfortable and platonic.\n\nIt’s even seen as a creepy thing by a lot of women, but I don’t blame them with how many men act with regard to women’s bodies. Oftentimes nudism goes from a creepy thing to something forward-thinking and rational when you stop to explain it fully.\n\nI even see a lot of benefit to nudism. I personally got way more comfortable with my body as I showed it to myself and to others.\n\nAnyway, thanks for listening to my little sales pitch. Try being naked the next time you’re alone. You won’t regret it.\n\nEdit: and go to r/nudism for more!",

It started because i was recently out of an abusive relationship and vulnerable either and couldn’t handle anyone getting too close to me (physically or emotionally) and i needed something intimate and delicate and precious in my life that was all to myself. And it made me feel sexy, when i hadn’t in a long while. i have a dedicated little drawer for each of thongs, bikinis, sexy/saucy lingerie, and lacey sleepwear. \n\nhere is the thing, my other dudes of the manly persuasion who have outdoor plumbing: \n\nI don’t care who you are, how straight or homophobic you are, what insecurities you have, or whatever else might stop you? cast those away.\n\nwomen have been keeping secrets from us when it comes to underwear, for a very very very long time, and it’s really sad because we are missing out. \n\nAlmost all women’s underwear is very soft, BUT contains spandex, and is meant to fit a range of women’s body shapes. what does that mean for us with our equipment? you wrap yourself up in some of these panties, and all day long and all night long, both your dick and your balls are comfortable, held tightly, but never uncomfortably (if they fit you well of course), and pampered like they’re the goddamned genitals of a king. There is NOTHING that has every felt so luxuriously amazing on my balls or my dick. you probably don’t need made-for-men ones with a dick pouch, the spandex handles all of that. \n\nMy recommended starter brand for everyday wear. “Jockey No-Pantyline Promise”, i highly recommend their thongs and the string/hi-cut bikinis. they’re made of an almost ladies-swimsuits fabric but lighter and softer, and very easily accommodate some extra space there. they’ll give you a 3/$20 (ish) deal often on their website, you can try a few sizes/styles for cheap that way. \n\nFor a starter brand for sexy wear? sofishie. have their own website and sell on amazon. stretchy, soft, comfortable, all in sexy bright colors often with lacey or ruffly trim. Your dick will feel like Ric fucking Flair in his amazing luxurious robe, all day long. You will hear your dick, in your head, shouting “WOOOOOOOOOO!” while swaggering to the ring while also sprach zarathustra plays, ready for some sexy fucking action. \n\npay attention to size charts and measure your hips and any other dimensions to check against. \n\nserious bros your balls will thank you. And so far, every woman that has seen mine has not been weirded out, but often impressed. i’ve heard “you have prettier panties than i do!” a couple of times. A friend of mine works at a bra/panties place that specializes in really finding a nice fit bra for happy comfortable titties, she recommended to me that i go there because they have pretty pa ties for cheap. you’d be surprised how many women would consider this a plus and sexy as hell. People of all genders who are very very turned on by an engorged swollen penis poking out of pretty panties that have a bow in the front, that makes your dick look nice and dressed up with a little bowtie. You’ll be serving your partners high class luxury dick on a golden fuckplatter. \n\ni will never wear underwear designed for men again. manly men might judge you, it might be awkward to explain at first to a new partner but so many people even seeing it the first time are like oh, okay, not what i expected but fucking HAWT. \n\nalso small psa: pay more attention to your prostate for sexy times. unless you just thought “duh, obviously” when reading that? you are missing the fuck out. \n\nbut i’d be embarrassed to tell any straight men about either of the above.",

Not even as an exaggerated \"oh look how cool and handsome I am\" deal, although admittedly I do self indulge sometimes.\n\nNo, I mostly enjoy writing stories either about official work or fan stuff where it's just me doing my own thing complete with my flaws and merits. I have a character in one of my stories that is literally me, just transported there, and he has all knowledge about the world and its magic system, which makes sense because we created it. However he's also the most unlucky person ever (like beehive falling out of a tree and on his head, or winning a million dollars and lightning lights it on fire), can't aim, isn't popular, has terrible social anxiety and people skills, and his/my best friend is the one that's actually competent. \n\nAnd on paper, that honestly sounds like it'd be a funny story tbh.

Sure ill get emotional occasionally, but I almost always keep that strictly on the internet with people who dont know me irl. Mostly because I try to promote my logical coolheaded side, especially now that ive matured (or I like to think I have). This helps contain and keep in control the icky mess of emotions in my brain sometimes. If something is or might be making me emotional, I tend to try to think about it rationally and shove any emotions about it deep down. It also doesn’t help that my social skills and emotional intelligence aren’t the best, and the vast majority of what I know I have learned from watching, observing, and interacting with other people. I like to think of myself similar to an AI in that regard. The difference is I have emotion and I don’t see things in 1s and 0s.",

            "text": "Never did this, and I don’t think it’s as uncommon of a thing or frowned upon as it used to be around 10-20 years ago, but I really want to have and wear a fursuit, as well as going to conventions in general. I’m embarrassed about this prospect though because some people think it’s only a childish thing, a weird fetish thing, a gay thing, or at worst a zoophile thing, which is definitely not me in any case. I just think the idea of creatively expressing yourself as if you’re basically a Disney plush mascot while making friends and doing simple fun activities like playing video games is a lovely idea. To me that sounds like it would help boost my confidence a lot. One major problem over even telling anyone about it though, is that doing those sort of things, let alone trying to get a fursuit, is expensive as hell, and they can easily go above quadruple digits, and that definitely not gonna happen since my family can’t even stay in the triple. So I tend to just keep that thought of mine a secret, as I don’t think it will ever even happen. Imagine a 22 year old trying to tell his parents something like that when he’s still stuck living with them and is unable to get a job due to being on the autism spectrum and potential temper issues from being on a job to begin with, let alone face the concern of what controversies that fandom has as a whole. (Even if it’s a loud minority, but it certainly doesn’t help) It’s literally **impossible** for me to come clean about. And for what, to not be able to do anything about it other than get some more weird looks? And on top of all that, COVID is still a thing, and there may be other weird or terrible people that I don’t want to ever meet. So yeah, I’d just pretend as if I’m completely oblivious to whole thing whenever it’s brought up.",

The history, workings, and hidden details of the rides and attractions, the insanely advanced animatronics, and best of all - the malfunctions!\n\nDid you know that the Yeti on the Matterhorn is a working animatronic? He's actually one of the most complex audio-animatronics that Walt Disney Imagineering has ever built. He stands 25 ft (7.6m) tall and his “skin” measures 1,000 square feet (93 m2). When operating in “A-mode,” he would reach out and try to grab riders as their train passed by. \n\nThe massive Yeti animatronic figure can move 5 ft (1.5 m) horizontally and 18 in (46 cm) vertically and the potential thrust in all its hydraulic cylinders combined gives 259,000 pounds of force, more instantaneous power than a 747-400 airliner. \n\nThe problem is, Disney Imagineers made a crucial mistake when installing him in Expedition Everest. Only months after opening in 2006, the stress caused by the Yeti’s movement split the figure’s framing which would cause a catastrophic malfunction if continued running in “A-mode.”\n\n\nIt has remained closed since then and has been operating in “B-mode.”  Imagineers have since installed a strobe light behind the Yeti giving it the appearance of movement and causing him to be affectionately called: Disco Yeti.",
