But I'm riding a death machine capable of 200mph, I expect not to live long, which makes it all that much better dying with a smile on my face instead of \"oh hey, that guy is coming up on my ass a little fast while at this red light. Oh wait, he's looking dow... BAM!\" I'll take a hard pass on dying like a bitch who doesn't have any control over that situation. \n\nBut to those who ride, they understand.

There are random people who refer to me as a certain nickname given to me now. I go into a bar and there's a few bouncers that refer to me as such and not my actual name (I don't think they know my real name). The rumor has been great but really raises the expectations from people. But since the rumor has been spread people believe they have the right to see it to know whether its true or not. I've had people try to pants me before out in public. I'm pretty sure my town is okay with sexually harassing me because of this rumor.",

Yes, to a degree, prefer to play it mostly. \n\nDo I know anything about the team, the players, the europa cup, Ligue 1, or any of that? No. The jersey was a gift from my friends in France when I went to visit them. \n\nNow I don't expect some stranger to know any of that information. However, while in line this guy around my age introduced himself to me as a fan of Marsaille asked me if I was a PSG fan. I said \"no, sorry, just watch the world cup games.\" then turned back around. Not catching the hint that I'm totally fine not trying to make small talk right now he says \"Well even though I am a Marseille fan. I think PSG has a good chance, they just acquired blah blah blah.\" \n\nI just said I don't follow the Ligue 1 teams closely and prefer to just watch the world cup as an event in totality. So I say \"Yeah? Cool, I have no idea as I don't follow the European cups...\" He was with his lady friend and I was with my girlfriend. I hoped that'd be the end and he'd catch a hint then chat with the person he was with. \n\nMinutes of time pass. \n\n\"So do you play anywhere around here?\"\n\nAnd I just couldn't anymore and I just turned to my Gf, pointed at some pictures on the wall and started making conversation about literally anything pretending not to hear him.\n\nSure, he was trying to be friendly and chat about something he recognized hence why he chose sports. Likely hoped to meet/chat to another Ligue 1 fan in the USA or something, that's awesome, great for him. But leave me alone unless I am wearing a sign that says \"Talk to me.\" I didn't put that shirt on that day hoping to make a friend who had similar interests as me. \n\nIt's just something guys do so frequently with me and I'm just not interested.",
