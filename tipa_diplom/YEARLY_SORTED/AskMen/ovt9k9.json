But -Instead the economy bottomed out 2008 and I fell backwards into insurance using other skills. There were no other jobs accepting me. The economy didn’t get better for 5 years in my area. But when it did I had still worked hard to make the best of a situation those 5 years and I did excel. Bc of this I earned a lot more, gained a  company car, tons of benefits, and with increases in pay got to a personal goal of home owner ship way faster than I would have even if I had got a design job out of school. \nI still miss creating and I sadly always will but the trade off I worked for and continue to had really been equally as good as my dream.

You can look at investing, maybe. Minimize any debt you're thinking of incurring.  \n\nSome will say that you'll have to start your own business, but will fail to disclose that 90% of start ups fail and even if you succeed you'll be looking at even longer hours than what a normal job would take. That's not even taking into account that you probably won't be rich and will just live kinda okay.  \n\nIf I were you I would start seriously looking at aiming for a job that you like/could tolerate, where you could save at least half of your salary.   \n\nNo commute time (close to where you live so you don't waste your life on traffic). Invest 20 to 30% of your monthly salary on any stock/crypto you think it's good or has a good future. Endure this for 5 years and take no debt (or at least not unecessary debt - maybe you'll need to borrow a couple grand to buy a car so you can get to work).  After 5 years, unless something catastrophic happened, you'll have several times your investment, and MAYBE you can be a little more free with your future choices.\n\nJust for the love of god, if you value the little freedom you have, don't fall into the buy a house / get married and work till you're 70 trap.  \n\nRemember, if you're in debt, you have no choice but to work and you need to accept whatever is thrown your way.  \n\nOthers will tell you that you need to get out of your parents house asap and get a wife and kids, but for me that's a trap. Take your youth and think ahead. Enjoy the rent free house while you can and definitely don't get married (when divorce hits, half of your shit is gone) or get kids (they're expensive af) while youre still figuring shit out.  \n\nA condom will probably be your best life investment right now.",

Everyone here is so complacent they don't understand that things COULD be better, we just choose not to try and change the system. I think people forget that the 5 day work week is outdated and doesn't belong in our society anymore. \n\nI never loved work. I still don't. I hate it. I don't expect anyone to like it and I think you're a little off your rocker if you love it. I struggled with the thought of working my whole life. There's a million other ways to spend time in life and we are slowly but surely getting to a point where we can have 4 day work weeks and universal basic income. That being said, I do believe that  we need to do a little work so our time off is worth it!\n\nMy advice is to live with your parents as long as you can, work really hard for a while, save up, and go travel as far and wide as you can. Try and gain some perspective and find out what you really want out of life. Always remember to be grateful for the little things and be mindful. That's what helped me.",

Also it should be noted that all of my advice is dependent on living in the current US system that fetishizes working yourself to death. \n\nUnless you're owner/operator of a business, no one really gives a flip about your well being. You will very likely be required to work 50-60 hours a week for 10 years at least.  Whether it's because you can't afford not to, or you're salaried and you've been assigned a job that needs to be done by an arbitrary date, you're going to be shit on from above constantly. And if you complain, it likely hinders your prospects for advancement. It will probably also take you 5-10 years to find a position in a business that gives you more than 2 weeks vacation and a week of sick leave (which is still a lot in my experience). And then once you have it, using it isn't always as straightforward as it might seem. After all, you can't have the whole business shutting down because it's beach/flu/holiday season.\n\nAlso your job won't stop when you go home, especially if it's remote work. There's always something that needs done, and someone else that doesn't want to do it.\n\nAnd don't assume that job security exists any more. Very few lifers these day, and honestly not a whole lot of business that make it that long without major personnel changes. Business is tough and economies can be very volatile not only locally, but globally that will affect your business. \n\nAnd before you go an think, well imma just get a gubment job... That's not a terrible plan, but you're still not immune to the whims of supply and demand. Also not all of them pay great, even if they're Union, just ask your teachers.\n\nThere's a short exposé on modern (20 years ago) meat packing called \"The Chain Never Stops\" About how it doesn't matter if workers are maimed or dead on the line, the factory doesn't shut down production for anything. Read it and come to terms with it. The sooner the better.\n\nThis is also all assuming the economy doesn't implode and WW3/the climate apocalypse doesn't happen in your lifetime... which it could.\n\nTL;DR: the scenario you're unable to cope with sounds way more cushy than my current white collar reality. That said, the rat race and living for the weekend ain't so bad if you find the right people to share it with. So, hold on to your hat and join me for part 2...",

About 49k per year, or about $23.55/hr if that's easier to relate to. I have 4 weeks vacation, plus the week between Christmas and New Years. I space those vacations out so I'm getting a full week off close to every other month. Those breaks help a lot. I also don't work with customers most days anymore.\n\nI'm also lucky enough to have my own place (I had some help from family on the down payment, which helped me purchase just before the insane bubble we're in took off.) Having my own place to come back to to unwind and destress is huge for me.\n\nFinally, it's important to remember that there is time to do things you want to do after work. Five sounds late, but if you go to bed somewhere between 10 PM and midnight, you still have five to seven hours after work to do things. And if you have a commute, that takes away from totally free time, yes, but I found when I had a commute playing a podcast I enjoy was a way to take that time back for me and make it mine rather than get annoyed with traffic.\n\nNow, do I want to work 40 hours a week. I mean no, of course not. Who does? If I won the lottery, I'd put in my two weeks notice as soon as the first payout hit my bank account.

Go to music events on the weekends. \nAnd in some of my free time im using my garage to start my own welding company so I can make my own schedule and make some serious money. \nIts your life, you get one, the opportunities in today's age are endless keep your head up and don't settle. Be the the best you can be and live a good life",

Over the years, these companies have put themselves in a position to hire you because they have provided something valuable to society that lots of people have paid for. In some ways, to contribute to someone else’s cause that society has deemed valuable makes your position valuable too.\n\nHowever, some people like to create value in society more directly. This is where entrepreneurship comes in to play. You get to directly decide what kind of impact you have on the world, and then work tirelessly to make it happen and raise money to make it happen. While this gives you immense freedom, it can also be risky since the value your company creates hasn’t been proven out and you don’t know for sure if people will actually find your idea valuable enough to pay for it. You also have to actually run the business. For example, if you love making robots and want to start a robotics company, a lot of your time will be spend on the *company* side vs the robotics side. For this reason, a lot of people might prefer working a 9-5, since they only have to work on a specific area without worrying too much about the business itself.\n\nIf none of that seems appealing, you can always join academia, where you strive to contribute to society by generating new knowledge through research and experiments. :)",

My advice:\n\n* Talk with your parents about budgeting. Assuming you're in high school, you probably don't know how much money comes in or where it goes. You might have a vague idea, but how do you know if it's accurate?\n* Think about what kind of lifestyle you want. Do you want to live in a 3BR apartment in the city or do you want to live in a 1BR house in the country? Do you want a new car, or are you OK driving used cars for your life? How many kids do you want? And so on. try to draw comparisons with the people you know (e.g. I like that uncle Jim has a big house and a maid, or I like that grandma Mary has been able to retire, or I like Crazy Billy's able to smoke crack on the stoop).\n* Put it down in writing, try to estimate how much the lifestyle you want and how much you *need*. Create some scenarios and estimate how much of a budget you'd need for each:\n   * Bare minimum sustenance. This is the minimum you'll find acceptable for long-term living.\n   * Doing OK financially (using your definition of doing well - This is more or less treading water)\n   * Doing extremely well (This is if everything goes your way in a practical sense. This doesn't mean assume you win the lottery, but that you have an upper-middle class lifestyle)\n   * Padmapper is a great resource for estimating renting costs in your city\n   * Nerdwallet is also a really good website. [In particular I hope you find this article on budgeting helpful.](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-budget)\n* Talk with the people at r/personalfinance and r/budgeting. They'll be able to give some solid advice on how much money you'll need for your various lifestyle scenarios. You'll want to get an idea of how much of an income you'll need to sustain the various scenarios\n* Take their advice and look up the [Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook.](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/) This is an bi-annual document made by the BLS that tracks various work-related things such as how many jobs, the projected growth, how much various jobs make, and their working conditions and their requirements. I suggest becoming **very** familiar with it because it's your best look into a broad number of possible careers. Is it infallible and correct 100% of the time? Of course not. Nothing is. But it's a good resource.\n   * When you find a job that meets your income requirements, look for:\n      * How much is it expected to grow? Or is it in decline?\n      * What is the nature of the work, do you think it would be interesting?\n      * What are the requirements - Does it require a PhD or just a bachelor's or no degree?\n      * Try to plan how you get from where you are now to working that job. What do you need to do?\n\nA big one is don't go to college just to go to college. College is a **huge** financial decision and it must lead to a path to pay for itself. Before you get a degree, you need to have an answer to: \"How does this lead to a higher-paying job?\"",

It's much cheaper than living on your own or even with a partner. When and if you're eligible apply for food stamps, save money wherever you can and always work towards your dream. Because you shouldn't spend half your life being a wage, and if you find a job you enjoy doing, it will feel much less like actual work. Good luck!",

Note I said most jobs.\n\nYour sense of self worth is critical to your health, but not to many employers unless you offer them greater value in return. That’s why you see director level roles typically getting better benefits packages — the company believes in their unique value and feeding the individual becomes key to corporate success.\n\nWhen you get into the working world do not feel obligated to stay in one place too long. Don’t be deceived into thinking decent jobs will turn into great jobs either. Take jobs that get you closer to your dream and never stop looking at your next step as you grow. For me, this meant taking generalist creative roles for startups until I could work solely as a copywriter. After about 7 years (a good chunk just finding my direction) I’m just short of six figures for a company that aligned with my principles, is doing great community work, and offers fantastic flexibility. For reference, I’m still in my 20s.\n\nSo, there’s one solution. The other? Focus on the rest of your identity. Work should not be 100% of you, or where you spend your energy. Trust me, your employer won’t compensate you for putting your dreams on the back burner so you can take that extra shift. Do your work, make sure you’re working toward that dream career, but cultivate friendships, community engagement, and hobbies that give you energy.\n\nUltimately you may find yourself relatively young and ready to turn those skills into work that actually matters to you. You’ll be amazed at how many unique jobs exist that you’ll never hear about normally (narrative designer was a surprise to me as a writer with dreams of working in gaming). The goal isn’t to not “work”, it’s to turn your natural skills into work that you believe in, that gives you energy, and allows you to be a present, whole person throughout your life.",

When it's that simple, then you can't be wasting your life because you're fighting for survival and helping your tribe. But if the tribe is actually a society of millions with diplomatic relations and technology sustaining them, then it is not as clear, but it's built and sustained with a LOT of effort from a lot of people.

I still have the feeling at 23, but actually grinding a couple years knowing how shit it is, is a great motivator to elevate your life and take education seriously. My only suggestion is to elevate your standards until you don't feel as if you're not wasting your life away. If that takes 100k a year, do something so you can make 100k a year, and make damn sure you accomplish it. I was on my way to a bachelors in computer science, did well in school, then had an existential crisis and stopped going to classes and let myself flunk out. Now im stuck in a 24k a year job (post taxes) trying to save up and get myself back in to college because fafsa wont lend me any money because I let myself flunk out. The years Im wasting now making 1/5th of what I could be is far more damaging than letting yourself get hung up on \"wasting\" your life away.

A 9-5 is a stability so you know that you are working and coming home in the evening for dinner with the family, you have vacation when something pops up and it can be saved, you get insurance for when your kid follows their friend to dumb shit and breaks their arm, you have the ability to fall sick and take a few days off without worry that if your absent you won't get paid. A 9-5 job is a God send little bro.\n\nIts not a waste of life when it means you can feed, house, protect, and enjoy life with the ones you love by working.",

It's only a waste if you personally consider it a waste. In reality, if you get personal satisfaction from your job, then ita harder to call it that. And even if you don't enjoy your job, if it's to help pay for something you think is important (hobbies, loved ones, etc.) Then it's less of a waste and more of a necessity.\n\nUltimately what I think it comes down to is this. If you either enjoy your work, or enjoy what your work allows you to do, then its not a waste. It can suck in the moment, but if a job gives you opportunities that you wouldn't have otherwise, satisfaction you wouldn't have otherwise, or helps pay for something you otherwise couldn't afford, you've found something worth doing.",

You can save yourself a lot of existential crises just by realizing this fundamental rule of economics\n\nDon't get too wrapped up in \"good\" careers.

As long as you like the paycheck more than you dislike the work, you're doing it right.\n\nI know when I was in my late teens and early twenties I had delusions about spending every minute of my life on only things that I loved. You begin to realize that you're not that special. The things you love have a lot of people out there that love them too. What you need to find is something you like that other people hate *or* something you love enough to make up for the meager pay or high stress. You'd have to win the employment lottery to find something that pays really well, is low-stress, and that you love.\n\nSome people get lucky or break their back getting to that one perfect job for them - usually by doing literally nothing but building their own business for 4+ years or working a bunch of shit jobs climbing the ladder. Others leverage their brains and get advanced and high-demand degrees that let them skip some of the grunt stuff, but those first bunch of years are still WORK.\n\nThere are no shortcuts, and the world isn't \"fair\" in the way that teens think it should be. The sooner you can figure out how to carve out your happiness within it's constraints, the sooner you can get to that promised land.\n\nAnd if this sounded a bit paternal, I don't mean it to be.

Pointing out the typo in the title is a bit too low effort, but I can tell you right now: you’ll be wasting more of your life thinking about this than you would be if you just picked a career and stuck with it. Life is not guaranteed, it’s not given and tomorrow is never granted. You’re lucky to wake up every morning, there’s literally no such thing as “wasting” your life unless you literally just do nothing with it, which seems to be the the thing you want to do since you can’t fathom working a career. Take every opportunity as it comes. \n\nBy the way, 1) not every job is 9-5 in an office, 2) vacation time depends on the company and your position 3) if you work hard now, you can retire earlier. People don’t like to admit it, as it points out that they made shitty decisions earlier in life to *not* grant them that opportunity, but it’s true. Play your cards right, and you can have a great life. Question the rules of the game and youre going to make the wrong move, or worse, youll skip your turn entirely. \n\nSincerely, somebody who wasted a lot of their young adulthood questioning the same things.

One of the lessons you'll learn as you get older especially if you don't have a support system with the expendable funds to be able to help you when you need it is that you better get okay with the feeling that you're wasting your life. A lot of us out here don't have any place or any person that we can go to when we need help. Not even these government social programs that supposedly are made so easy for people to use.

The 3 hours for self care and travel are something you have to do. Then you have 16 hours of free time on the weekends.\n\n2) When youre an adult your concept of wasted time changes. It becomes more about time lost in the past than time that may be wasted in the future.\n\n3) Most office jobs only involve about 5 hours of actual work. If you do that and then figure out an additional hour of work you can still get away with some hobbies like creative writing or listening to an audiobook at work.\n\n4) You can make work friends that add some meaning and joy to your work day. Friends you have now are going to grow apart from you and you from them and its actually really hard to find friends outside of work.\n\n5) If you find a hobby you can find some satisfaction in the fact that your work gives you the means to pursue your hobby. Otherwise people plan traveling vacations that they could't afford otherwise.\n\n6) If you take the advice to save up about 6 months of emergency funds you can work without feeling the need to stay at that particular job. You have the means to look for a job at a different job. Most jobs dont have pensions anymore so retirement plans are tied to 3rd parties so you dont lose out as much on changing jobs. In fact most people change careers in their 30s.\n\nYou also have to ask what the alternatives are.

It may seem like if you have more time youre going to waste less of it, but youd be surprised at how hard it is not to just piss the day away.

I've had coworkers bike to work, and that's a clever way to combine exercise and commute but depending on the weather they can come in drenched from rain or sweat. Gross either way.\n\nA lot of offices are divided into teams and your team will usually take an hour off at about the same time (or half will take lunch while the other stays, then switch). So it's more likely you're there for 9 hours, ie 8-5., not sure why the expression is 9 to 5. If you're a pharmacist or something that can't leave your post, people will bring you lunch and you eat during small gaps in your work.\n\nCommute back home. So really honestly more like 7 to 6.\n\nYou have to make yourself dinner since the whole point is you're working to earn and save money. So there's another hour of prepping and eating and cleaning because you're in your late thirties now and your doctor says your triglycerides are a little high so you're trying to eat healthier.\n\nSo now it's 7:30 PM and you're so blown out from all the choices and mental / social / physical energy you've expended at work that you are too tired to do any actual fun hobby stuff for the rest of the evening.

Get in the habit of doing things correctly the first time. That's lesson one! Lesson two. If you want to achieve goals that are monetarily derived, like owning a house or a nice car or taking vacations to exotic places or having an expensive hobby then you're going to have to come to the realization that you're going to have to get into the grind. Unless you invent something amazing or strike it rich via a long lost uncle at some point life is going to take work. Lesson three. You don't have to enter the rat race right away. You can take the path of less and just do enough to get by. Odd jobs here and there when you need cash. Be able to work on your own stuff to fix it. Eat hamburger helper instead of steak etc. It's possible. I know guys who did that right out of high school. College want an option for them and they had no desire to go to trade school so they moved to SoCal and kind of lived homeless for a few years. This was back in the late 89's and early 90's. Weather was pretty nice all the time and it wasn't to hard to get free meals from the mission or pick up a job washing dishes or doing yard work. They all did it for a few years until they met a girl they wanted to settle down with. They realized real quick that living in a van down by the ocean and eating spaghetti O's out of the can wasn't going to cut it with the chicks. One came out of it great. He learned how to weld and ended up opening up his own shop. Of course he now works 60-80 hours a week but make over 500k a year. The other guy, not so well. Drugs and alcohol ended up killing him after he spent a couple years in the clink for petty robery. Lesson four. Trade school. Go to trade school and figure out a trade that suits you. One that interested you and that you like. If you're doing a job that you like then it's not too bad. Maybe work for someone for a couple years then go out on your own and be your own boss. But I know this from personal experience, if you don't like work and tons of responsibilities then owning your own business is a sure failure waiting to happen. My point with all this is you have options and you need to source those out and see what fits you best. Maybe beach bum is your best you. Maybe fireman is. Or maybe owning your own electrical business is. Anyway you cut it though, life as you get older takes work. Better get that in your head. The older you get the more difficult it becomes to just hang around and live without real means. Good luck.",

The sense of being involved in impacting the world in some way by working for a company with the intent and talent to do so can give you the feeling that you are not wasting your life away. \n\nI'm fully aware though that corporate culture doesn't necessarily promote the sort of capitalist utopia I am insinuating with that advice, because generally people who work 9-5 mostly do their work as a means to maximize the profits of their company. But I'm sure there are workplaces in which you believe in its cause and its goals; workplaces that exist not only to maximize profits but to bring REAL value to society. I suggest you choose those organizations to work for, and not be blinded by the shiny salaries or even employee benefits of already established yet greedy and profits-focused kinds of companies. These companies may fashion themselves as a benefit to society and while it's true, learn the skill of reading beneath the surface.\n\nAnd it's not like you could always stay in that place. Use your free time in the Weekends to try something new or learn a new skill that might help with work. \n\nBut above all, ask yourself what is it that you really want? What do you really want to achieve in life? And then plan and work towards it. You'll know if your goals are realistic if the plan is doable, much more if you're already working on it. You'll notice you will need to make sacrifices to get them done, and even do and learn things you might feel uncomfortable doing, but that doesn't matter since you are working towards what you want. It's unlikely you'll make a plan that's perfect enough that it won't change, but at least you have a plan. Even if you shift plans midway and feel a little bit backtracked, hey, you're moving places, which is probably more satisfying than 9-5 stagnation.",

So, if you can live off $40K per year, you need $1M invested. This is more achievable than many think. For instance, if you make $60K and invest $20K of what you make a year, it would take a little over 20 years to have $1M invested. This assumes that you don't get a raise at all, which is not very likely. If you were to do some jumping around every few years and worked to make as much as you can while saving as much as you can, you could cut the time down to less than 10 years. \n\nRetiring early would allow you to do whatever you wanted, which could mean not working or working at a non-profit that you care about, or taking a job that doesn't pay much, but does something you love. It gives you a lot of flexibility not only when able to retire, but while working because you would have enough money to coast for a while in the unlikely event that a pandemic hit the world, and you were laid off for a year or something like that. :)",

            "text": "Other posters' advice about prioritizing your family, hobbies, etc outside of work are all very much valid, and unequivocally great advice.\n\nWhat isn't often said, however, is that these aren't the only way. Personally, to me, those aren't enough (or maybe it's better to say that they're not right for me). Luckily, you don't have to do the 9-5 grind in an office. There are plenty of trades that offer a similar path (and, depending, often similar or better pay) but I would argue are often more fulfilling in the work itself.\n\nAdditionally, you don't have to be stuck in the 9-5 at all. you can pursue your relative professional freedom through many different paths like opening a business or becoming proficient in a highly sought after profession (doctors, pharmacists, engineers, lawyers, etc etc). Just be aware that there is no magic trick to becoming successful, especially in this sense; it's going to take a metric fuck ton of work to do it, and it will likely be years of schooling and/or work to see it realized (and even then you're going to have to sit down and figure out exactly what you are and aren't willing to sacrifice for it, because you absolutely will have to make sacrifices).\n\nOverall, there's nothing wrong with taking part in the rat race. Some people do so and find ways to live perfectly happy and healthy lives. That's absolutely fine.\n\nThe biggest thing is that you need to sit down and have a conversation with yourself (the sooner the better, and to be honest it sounds like you've already got the first step in nice and early, which is awesome) about what you do and don't want your life to look like. Be flexible with it: you will change as much as life does over the years, and so your plan will inevitably change, but you also need to be realistic about it. Everybody wants to have enough money that they never have to do the less enjoyable parts, but that's just not how life works. \n\nOn the positive side, though, being realistic doesn't just mean limiting your dreams and your plans - it also includes things like realizing that a relatively boring 9-5 isn't all bad because your life happens 24 hrs/day 7 days/week, not just 8 hours/day 5 days/week, so how you fill the weekends and the remaining 8 hours on weekdays is more impactful by far. Another way of looking at that is that you're not just living for the weekend; for every (roughly) 40 hours you spend at work and 40 hours you spend asleep during the week, you get another 40 hours free, *then* you get 32 hours free on the weekend. It's not all doom and gloom\n\nMake it so that, whatever you decide, there's a good balance between the good and the bad, and that you're taking a path that you find fulfilling. Then, be willing to sacrifice and work for what you want in life, but (going back to the balance) never giving up your standards for it, and be ready and willing to change directions on the fly off you need or decide to. This includes family, hobbies, friends, work, education, or whatever else you can think of",

I was set that an office job would just kill me, ruin everything and suck my life out of me. I was severely depressed and really struggling cause I couldn't get my more creative dream to work, but \"office job would kill me.\"  \n\n\neventually after years of barely earning any money, struggling etc. I was forced to get a job in a callcentre. Now I was lucky, caveat is tehre's shit ones.  \n\n\nI immediately made new friends. Yes work wasn't great, but fucking about with my friends between calls was. Sure I had 8 less hours a day of playing videogames, but I also had 24 less hours of feeling like i was sad, gonna be homeless and under constant financial pressure. I made some great long term friends, learned new skills, and through my shitty call centre job, found another office career that I really enjoy. Now I earn really well, work 8 hours a day from home while chilling, and have a creatively fulfilling job. Yes it's an office job, but it's still really fun and engaging (I work as a product owner.)  \n\n\nThere's 2 key takeaways:  \n\n\nWhatever job you get, doesn't need to be your job forever. Since that first job I have managed to get promoted once a year. I also try to never work past my finish time (If I do i take the time back the next day) and keep a healthy work life balance.  \n\n\nAll office jobs are not equal. What I realize now is that job I wanted (Art in games industry) is also an office job, even if its making art - and, would have SO much worse rights and benefits than what I currently have.  \n\n\nYeah it sucks to cut out that gaming fun time, but keep jumping jobs til you find one that works with you. Initially I would work weekends, I would have to be exactly in and out and sometimes have shift go late. Now its mon-fri, do 39 hours accross the week, just be free for meetings between 10-16 and my boss doesn't really care what I do as long as shit gets done. Because my jobs all about thinking, creating and planning and not so much just getting mindless stuff done.  \n\n\nFinding the irght company, the right job is key. It's not so much about what you actually do, but more about who you do it for and with. The best decision I have ever made in my life was to take an office job instead of struggling as an artist. it also made my art better, and my gaming better, cause I could just do them for fun. It meant that I only had to spend that allotted time every day to worry bout food/where to live (and most of it is pretty easy) and the rest of it was just fun. Not spending every sincle second awake worrying about how i was gonna eat tomorrow or pay rent and feeling guilty if i was doing anything not helping towards that.   \nWas a bit of a rant but tehre you go",

Our company is just a refrigerator factory but it offers weekend 3x12 shifts, weekday 4x10 shifts, and weekday 5x8 shifts. There are opportunities to educate and advance yourself too to more than double your wage and increase your vacation time.  I personally applied for and took an apprenticeship at my company. It was a lot of work. But it increased my pay by a ton and added more vacation time. I’m currently working 4x10s so I get 3 day weekends. But if I wanted to go (back) to weekends, I could have 4 day weekends (again). I get to do lots of outdoorsy trips, since that’s what I’m into. We are driving right now to a 250 mile trail my son and I are going to finish tomorrow.\n\nThat’s just our one company. There are lots of companies out there like that.

I usually have 1-2 social events a month, this doesnt seem like a lot, but i'm trying to sort my finances out and i cant really justify getting hammered every weekend when i owe money. It works for me. Even a lunch/dinner here and there or a coffee. I have a friend who lives in another city, i try and talk to her maybe 1s or 2s a week over the phone for a couple hours, even if its just to talk about dumb shit we see our co-workers doing.\n* My career means that i am always moving forward, in my work i dont feel like im stagnating because i have a goal to move towards and promotion waiting for me. This is part of being an engineer, if you prove your worth and earn the qualifications, there will always be a role for you higher up. All you need to do is put in the extra hours.\n* In terms of annual leave, i get 23 days off a year, i can buy an extra 5 and then get 12 flexi days a year. Wherever you work, you will have various options to make more money or get more days off. There are opportunities out there if you look hard enough to find a good balance. I know a guy who works 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off for 12 hour days with wind turbines. I know a guy who works 4 days on, 3 days off 12 hour shifts. There is a lot of variability out there, you can find what works for you.\n* The weekdays do go fast, and the weekends tend to drag on a bit for me, i used to think i would hate it, but it's so nice moving towards goals and having money for clothes, a car, buying myself and mates drinks and going on holiday with friends. The work is worth it for the extra financial freedom.\n* A lot of work places are more of a community, get to know your colleagues, find common interests and talk about them, choose to be sociable and ask questions. I promise you, learning social skills will help the time fly and you might find yourself actually looking forward to going to work on some days, because you get to work with some of these people.\n* Office jobs, in the Uk in particular, many offices are going to remain closed for at least part of the week to try out \"smarter working\", this means you can role out of bed into work for 1-2 days a week. As long as you get your shit done, no reason you cant have netflix on in the background.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main thing that keeps me going is knowing that i am moving towards my goals and the best version of myself with the finances to go behind that. You need a carrot to keep you going, you cannot just live with a stick beating you to go to work. It isn't sustainable, you'll find yourself getting drunk every weekend or being miserable. Find a career, pick some goals and stick to it. If you're in the Uk, you can do an Open university course or something similar to go along with your work. In the USA, you can do the Jobs Corps to help get you a career.\n\nProgress, slowly buying myself little luxuries, new clothes, new bed sheets to help stop acne, new shoes, better skin care, protein supplements. These things all add up and add to your wellness.\n\nI will say that my social life isn't exactly popping, i would definitely like to see my friends more, but right now it just isn't feasible. Having said that, when i have paid off some debts and have more freedom, i'm going fucking crazy, the 2nd half of my 20s is going to be liiit.",

That's the short answer.\n\nThe long answer is that I feel I have the luxury of a job I like with a purpose I believe in. Not every job can be this but the idea that office jobs are just zero value and of no substance doesn't have to be true. It's one of those things that's nearly impossible to imagine at 16 because you've not experienced that world. \n\nNot every job has value including in offices but just because you cannot see the value of your work translating directly it doesn't mean there is no value. We don't just sit around typing numbers into boxes and then saving them on a server never to be used and sending emails around asking for \"TPS reports\". I mean some people do. I think most marketing, copyright lawyers and lobbyists shouldn't exist. \n\nBut those people running around doing the actual stuff need plans and stuff which can be done more efficiently in a dedicated environment (ie an office) so they can focus on doing those actual jobs. People can monitor and review and become a \"force multiplier\" though yes you can overdo it and end up top heavy. Logistics chains need coordination. Results need monitoring to ensure they're happening. Legal requirements must be fulfilled like keeping accounts, meeting staffing conditions, safe working environments. People need to manage teams to make sure everyone is competent, happy and healthy.\n\nOf course I'm talking about an ideal environment. I work in the public sector so we tend to underpay but otherwise offer sensible working conditions, a drive to ensure what we do actually benefits the public and also to constantly improve efficiency (if possible). \n\nI might do accounting but I give service managers managing hundreds of people the information they need to make a plan that actually adds up to fill their duties with their limited funds, I make sure their savings plans will actually realise the amounts they expect, their projects won't overspend and use money we absolutely do not have, help them identify when they're in danger of overspending in year and why so they can take action etc. I help ensure grants are filled in, I help monitor for fraud, ensure we're complying with our responsibility to submit accounts to the general public and so on. As one person I support millions of pounds of expenditure and a couple of dozen middle and strategic managers in some fashion. The idea you have is probably tonnes of people just doing shit all, but the service I supported had (including me and my colleagues) a ratio of about 4:1 front line staff to back office, back office including the stores, the people who maintain their sites, the people who coordinate with other organisations and so on \n\nIf you can't find an office job that makes a positive contribution or lack the ability to understand how those roles can add value then don't do an office job. Or make sure you get one that you can clock entirely out of it at the end of the day and that leaves you time to live.",

I know how that sounds, and trust me I am the farthest thing from a boss so I’m not trying to bullshit you here. I had aspirations of being an artist, filmmaker, globe-trotting peace corps volunteer. Guess what I do now, I’m a residential tradesmen. I go in every day 8-4/5, listen to messages from people about plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling problems they have then call them and head over to their home to crawl thru the bowels of their neglected utility rooms/crawlspaces getting covered in who knows what and try to fix whatever problem they have. Most of my clients live in rural areas too so the elements hit just a tad harder. I’m far from what I saw myself doing as an adult as I wanted to be creative and meet new people and help out. Here’s the kicker, after years of examining my life and what I do I realized I sort of got what I wanted, I just needed to ask myself why I wanted to be in those other fields that I didn’t get into. Realistically I have to be pretty creative to figure some of my daily problems out, it’s a nice challenge. I meet tons of people, usually welcomed with open arms as I’m fixing their problem and they probably see some refuge I didn’t realize I was carrying in the back of a truck. And of course I’m getting to help people, which makes me all sorts of grateful to be contributing to society the way I get to. It took years to get good at these trades too, but as long as I kept the learning relevant to what I wanted to do or be it made it much easier to retain and use later to help people that needed it. There’s no ego about this, like I said I did not want to be this, it was sort of a hand I was dealt that I convinced myself was worth holding on to. I dreamed of having a little hobbit farm and work shop to create my art in and honestly I’m closer to that now than I would have been had I tried to be a career artist right away. Learning to love has been one of the biggest epiphanies I’ve had in my life time and pursuing that perspective with my family and hobbies, I’ve been able to afford to pick up with this day job, has really made me have a more optimistic view of life. Let your day job be framework for how you treat the other important parts of your life, let it craft your work ethic and learn to love the parts about it so you can practice magnifying the little beauties in your every day life.

Alternative scheduling and work practices are becoming more common now. Take nursing for example. You come in for 2 shifts back to back, both of them 12 hours, and then you're off for 3 days, work 1, off for another 2. Those shifts sound long but you'll get used to it (I'm not a nurse btw but I have similar scheduling.) There's also trade professions and you could always start your own business, but with that you have to work very hard towards the beginning then you're able to kick back later.\n\nBut hey, that's why they say to find a career you LOVE and not just a job. If you truly love your work, it doesn't become such a mental burden because you actually truly enjoy the work. Think of your dream career and do what you can to attain it. Firefighter? Start taking fire science classes in high school, if they offer it as an elective (mine did.) Cop? Get into a junior program or take criminal justice and get involved in programs with the community.

I guess it’s the same kind of mentality because I’m looking forward to retiring and not having to work the 9-5. \nI also enjoy the work I do. Every job has stressors but I don’t have a negative feeling during my work day. Covid has also helped a lot.

In a way, you're right.\n\nAlas, we all need to be pragmatic, unless you're a trust fund baby, you will need to generate some form of cash flow in order to survive; then again surviving is not enough. These are my random thoughts on the matter:\n\n1. Don't get crippled with consumer debt. Now that you're 16 is the time to learn about \"Financial Literacy\", as much as I hate that term, you know what I mean.\n2. Don't get hung up on materialism. Now that you're 16 it's probably very hard, peer pressure to 'conform\" is high. Rest assured that it will continue as you age, so might as well learn about it now, and then make an informate decision. \n3. [this puts #1 and #2 above together] you see, living a materialistic live and financing it with consumer debt is good business for all sorts of companies, and than it's also good for politicians, all politiciacn from all sides, and - why not - for all religions.  Don't get me wrong, there's some \"comfort\" in going with the group, in buying \"nice things\" just like everyone else, posting on FB/IG about conspicuous consumption; and then blame banks, credit cards, landlords, the systems, the ruch and the \"other\" party for being broke AF.\n4. The solution: develop a career where you can get \"enough\" to live, also develop some interesting interests (redundant redundant, I know) where you can draw satisfaction.  With time the two will converge and your career will overlap close to 100% of your interest. And possibly you might develop a line of business and become an entrepreneurs on those lines.\n5. Related to #4 above you'll require a good amount of edication, a combiantion of traditional/formal education (college / Open Course Ware) and non traditions/informal education (anything else that can be found on google).\n6. At the same time and while you're doing all of the above, you are creating your life. Creating your life is your meta-priority #1, everything else is at best a subset of that.\n\nThe entoire process is a marathon, not a sprint.  You're 16, you and enjoy your youth and - at the same time - build and create your future but building and creating your own persona. \n\nAnd read. Read the good stuff. And write. Write every day. Develop habits that improve your life, they all compound.\n\nAnd keep in mind that you'll make mistake. Making mistakes is part of the process and it's awesome. Even more awesome is to learn to pick up the pirces, get up, and continue on your journey, ignoring the peple who laugh at your mistakes, those same people will hate you for your successes.\n\nMake sure that you make good mistakes, worthy mistakes. A DUI or getting caught in drugs are stupid mistakes. Failing while trying to solve interesting problems are the greatest and best mistakes ever. They are gifts that keep on giving.\n\nYMMV",

Maybe you're a touring musician that's not making much headway, but you meet another band who you recognize as having much more potential than you. You already have the contacts in the industry, so you become their manger, or you learn how the business  works along the way, you are friends with a whole bunch of bands, so you decide to become a promoter and put on concerts and festivals.\n\nI have a friend from my little middle of nowhere town in Australia who wanted to be an actor, how we all laughed, what a hopeless dream, the teachers at our school flat out told him he was dreaming. Long story short, he's now living in the U.S. as a very high level executive for one of major networks, having found his way into that career through not making it in the one he started out pursuing,  but learning as many skills as he could and making a bunch of contacts along the way.\n\nDo you get what I'm saying? you can spend 40 years as a night watchman in a cranberry silo and then die, or you can go after work that you think will be interesting and fulfilling and just adjust your course as necessary and I know it doesn't seem like it, but you're a kid until you're 30, so if you fuck it all up and have to go back and retrain from scratch in something else, it's honestly not that big a deal in your 20's. Most people are only just beginning to figure out what they might want do with their life on the back end of their 20's. I was a drifting backpacker doing hospitality work around the world until I was 28, now I'm a multi millionaire and get to pick whatever projects I feel like working with, because I learned a bunch of shit along the way and I've never been scared to jump in the deep end and figure it out as I go.\n\nNow get out there, the only real failures are the ones who are too scared to try.",

I had experience from being a reactor operator on a submarine and had my bachelor’s degree, and KNEW that I didn’t want to do the same thing over and over, every day for the rest of my life.

Every day has a different problem, so I’m not doing the same boring thing, sitting at a desk, and I have loads of time off, which allows me to not let my job define me, and I still make more money and experience less stress than I could have at a job that I have my degree for.

I'm 33 now and working towards slowly towards getting out of this cycle by starting my own business. You have a the most valuable asset. TIME. I know it sounds cliche but you really do. In the meantime, there's a few things you can. Find a job, any job that doesn't require much responsibility, like retail and do that for 5 years, invest most of it, save some of it and fund your hobby/passion on your way to making a business out of it. And if there is a career out there that you like or find at least somewhat enjoyable then work towards that while you work on figuring out what you want to do yourself. I work in IT. I enjoy it. Is it my dream job? ? No, but I like it enough that it doesn't really feel like I'm wasting my life away and in the meantime I work on my hobby and I'm trying to find a way to make it into a business which I know I will.

I work 50-60 hours a week on average, but I am now at a point where my work is rewarding to do, the people I work with are great, and the compensation (pay, insurance, etc.) is enough to enable reaching life goals and to support hobbies and fun events. This took me 5 years of school and 7 years in the workforce to get in the right path.\n\nThe second piece of it is to make sure you carve out time for those goals and hobbies, and I highly recommend at least one of those hobbies get you outside (e.g., hiking, climbing, walking).

After my degree I know I will have probably a mentally draining 9-5 at a desk working with CAD software every day but at least then I'll have more physical energy like my brother who has it figured out. Every morning either a trail run or mountain bike ride, and on the weekends more fun outdoor stuff like camping with his family or tinkering with his drones and 3d printer. My vice happens to be military aviation shit and hopefully fly after my degree. Once you grow up a little bit more you will be able to figure out what yours is. Is it making more money doing what you love with friends you love? Or is it doing hobbies like video games, working on your car, etc etc. Just find your balance in terms of having more energy, getting into a routine, and slowly add in your hobbies here and there.

Everybody has a job, they want to talk about hobbies and interests.\n\nI hear a thought somewhere, and maybe it'll help you relax about this whole future thing.

The other thing I use it for is for the youth group I help lead.  I'll show a high school kid how to make a pen or a cutting board for their mom, all while talking to him, listening to his problems, giving him advice, helping him find out what he is passionate about.

There are positions/careers out there that don’t follow a normal 9-5 soul crushing schedule. And you are at a great age to start researching that and adjust your life’s path to be qualified in those fields. Just off the top of my head: teaching (you get most of the same breaks as the kids, so 3-4 months total a year), nursing (I have a friend that only works 3-4 days a week in 12-18 hour shifts), highly specialized (my boyfriend has a PhD in electrical engineering and works from home, sets his own hours, and is constantly fielding new employment offers), or a creative career (I have a BFA and MA from an art school and myself and many of my classmates have started our own businesses, or just love their work because it’s part of our artistic outlets). The most vital thing in this journey is finding out what is important to you and your ideal lifestyle, and figuring out how to shape your life around that.

You could argue that society has reached the point where even 40 hours isn’t necessary, but if you’re looking for a glass-half-full view, a lot of people not that long ago would have really liked to work “only” 40 hours a week. Getting down to a 40 hour standard week was a BIG accomplishment. You could be a factory worker in the early 20th century, for example- no OSHA at all, work 6 days a week 12 hours a day, no social safety net of any kind outside of maybe a hypothetical church family assisting you or just begging for pennies on the street. By their perspective, we have it great- sit in an air conditioned office with unlimited restroom breaks/no chance at all of a bodily injury or losing a finger or limb. \n\nI also- and I’m not a boomer, I’m only 35- feel like I really matter, at least a LITTLE, at my job- people count on me to do certain things, and there’s a sense of pride in that. I also try to be generally agreeable and want to be well liked, so that way it’s not “ugh I’ll do the bare minimum, talk to no one, then go home.” If you feel like you’re a part of something and develop a certain esprit de corps with your coworkers, it makes the time go by a lot faster. A lot of times, this is finding solace in someone else complaining about the exact same things you do. I’ve worked various jobs in completely different fields, and the one commonality among coworkers is this: “The guy in charge is always an idiot.” It’s not necessarily true, but every job, you’ll bellyache about what the boss could/should do or not do. There’s a sense of belonging in that. \n\nAlso, and this depends a lot on your social/family circles, I’m one of these types that would feel…I guess the word is “ashamed?”…if I did NOT work 40 hours a week, or have a lot of stress in fewer hours- like maybe an air traffic controller or something. I guess you could still have respect if you’re some sort of business owner who is able to make it work with fewer hours, but I don’t really know anybody like that. I guess you could certainly call this “peer pressure”; but getting this respect is important to me personally. My family has a good life, I look forward to the free time I do have, and if I tried to transition to a lot shorter job/work schedule, it would be tough to provide for my wife and son for at least quite a while, and would be an even tougher sell to my parents, unless my idea is rock solid. “I’m telling you, underwater guitar playing- it’s a THING!”/jk",

But the thing\nWith work that makes it so unpalatable is dealing with politics/bosses/pointless shit you don’t care about.\n\nIf you can get yourself into a niche where you can remove as much of that as possible work,\nisn’t so bad.\n\nAvoid the generic corporate jobs like the plague \nUnless you want to sit around doing shit spreadsheets you don’t care about, making awkward small talk with bosses you don’t like about synergy and partaking in cringe inducing “fun office culture”. A lot of office jobs are largely just made up of pointless tasks that don’t matter but then bring a whole bunch of stress anyway because you have to sit down and produce them for your boss. \n\nAnother hint, the smaller the organisation the better, the bigger the organisation the more bureaucracy and the more frustrating. \n\nWorking as a contractor in some technical work for a local/state/federal government is usually pretty solid too\n\nEdit to say:\n\nInvest early in retirement, it might seem like a long way away but life moves pretty fast. Put extra money into your retirement package (super/401k don’t know what other countries have) buy shares, if you can invest say 5k a year every year from the age of say 21 by the time\nYour 40 that is going to be a fairly significant chunk of change. I’m looking to retire at around 55 so I have about 20 something years of work ahead, if I had started to think about it at 20 instead of 30 I could have maybe made that 45. \n\nDon’t completely deny yourself though, have fun, travel, go out, party but just think a bit more about your expenses. Buy a used car instead of new, stay in a cheaper hotel or hostel when you travel. Luxury shit is a waste of money, every dollar you lose is another dollar you have to earn working",

But it’s not *always* this soul crushing existence nor does it have to be. You can and should have a life outside of work. I’ve been learning the guitar, I like to read and sometimes play video games, I go out with friends like clockwork every weekend. I’ve been thinking about taking up writing too. But I really cannot stress enough how important I think it is to have a job you don’t hate. This is very, very different than having a job you love, but if you have a job you hate you will burn out and get depressed. \n\nAlso money. Money is nice. Money pays for the roof over your head and the food you eat. It pays for your hobbies and your social life. It pays for your furniture, your toothpaste, your internet, your phone, your car, your doctor visits, your clothes. Would you like these things? Money. Would you like more or better versions of these things? More money. Would you like to go on dates? Money. Cash is king and money makes the world go round. \n\nLastly I’ll mention you don’t *have* to do a 9-5. You could start a business, like a friend of mine has her own graphic design company and it’s literally just her and her assistant and she takes contracts. No office she works from home. Contract jobs let you take the work you want to and often let you set your own hours. You could teach, you could open a coffee shop, you could write a book, you could work construction. You can do whatever you want and many people don’t work 9-5 office jobs cuz they despise it. 9-5’s are just very common and typically pay pretty well. Find something you kinda like that can make good money and do that. I kinda like programming, so I do software. You could kinda like marketing, graphic design, website design, economics and math, working with your hands like construction or landscaping or carpentry or welding, whatever, as long as you don’t hate it.",

It may just be a job where you and your coworkers get to talk about stuff, problem solve, be a team and get stuff done, but most of all respect each other and like working together. The same goes for your boss. \n\nYou also have to remember what you’re working for. Is it just to afford basic necessities? Is it to allow you to spend that 4 weeks off traveling the world? Is it to provide for the people you love? Even the most mundane jobs can have a purpose that is very meaningful to you. Find the meaning. Every job out there exists because someone needs that thing done. It’s only a waste of time if you have other things that you can do with your time that you find more meaningful - and that you can afford to do (you still gotta pay the bills). If you can get a better job, do it. If you can get paid more for the job you have, more power to you. Above all, your pay should make it worth your time to do the job.",

But, I will say that even some of the smallest choices one makes in life may result in a HUGE difference in someone else's life. In my mind, it's the choices of everyone, including myself, that has placed me where I am in life today.\n\nNo, I don't blame any one person for my status, for the items I've obtained, for the habits I created, for the work mentality I have, etc. However, I do acknowledge that not only could I have made better choices in my life, but somewhere along the line other people could have made ***different*** choices that would directly or indirectly affect my life. And currently in my life I'm at that stage where I have to work my 8 30 - 5 job because if I didn't have it, I would (most likely) end up on the streets.\n\nTrust me when I say that putting all of your bets on one thing you're good at, or possibly one subject that you're majoring in, does not mean you will end up with your dream job, your dream place of living, dream family life, and so forth. At the same time though, if you spread out your interests too far (like I have), then you find yourself in this mundane, stagnate lifestyle which compresses the life force out of you to the point where one just wants to give up. Give up, as in stop trying to better their position in life overall. \n\nI'm thankful I haven't though. Because of my individuality I've found myself learning new skills, investing time into new hobbies/interests, and generally obtaining all sorts of useful (and not so useful) knowledge that I may not have been able to come across had I not chosen the path I did. It's actually surprising to me that I can still do this with my current job lol.\n\nIn short, ***life is random, due to ALL the choices we (collectively) make.***\n\nSometimes you just have to accept where you're at in life, and figure out a path to better employment, bettering yourself, and obtaining a lifestyle you're more comfortable with.\n\nI look at the situation you propose like this: Some people don't endure that situation for long periods of time while others think of it as a sort of investment toward a better living situation closer to the end of their life. \n\nRegardless if people think they're wasting their life working that type of job or not, sometimes they just have to put up with it due to their personal situation. \n\nAnd to be straightforward with you, I agree. \n\nIt is a waste of life to work at a 9 to 5 with little benefits/time off.",

Across any industry you probably won't be doing thIngs the same way for 30-40 years. Technology, technique, tools, it's all subject to change. And even if they didn't each situation will be unique enough that you can still learn and improve your craft. That or people move into other positions tangential to their training.\n\nThat's not to say there won't be repetition. I work in medical imaging, which is repetitive af by design. Have knee exams changed a great deal over the thousands I've done? Not much, but a little. I've certainly gotten good at them. And as the hardware has gotten better so have the exams.\n\nAnd then every so often something new comes along that's a game changer in one way or another. It usually involves some booklearning and time to get up to speed. For me it was a bonkers new scanner and the sorts of exams it could do, shit I'd never seen before.\n\nBased on what you've said, if I were you I'd look for a career that has some upheaval. That could mean a few different things - either the daily tasks are always different (like a firefighter, from dealing with fire to car accidents to cats in trees), or the training/education is general enough that it'd be good for many different types of jobs or would be so transferable you could work anywhere (trades, computer sciences).\n\nI don't know. I totally get what your saying. But while a career is such a big part of life it doesn't have to be your whole life. Hobbies help. Continuing to learn is so important. When I was done with schooling I just sort of stopped learning. Took me a long time to realize that I enjoyed learning and could finally pick what I wanted to learn. Enter: hobbies.\n\nOkay that's enough rambling. Hope some of it was helpful. Take care.",

Because if you rush into college you'll end up getting some B.A. that will land you at an office job working 9-5. \n\nSometimes joining the military isn't a bad option too, most jobs within the military don't involve you ever even seeing combat.

Most jobs in the military, especially if you can write code or are somewhat computer savvy, have you behind a desk doing some really cool stuff and after a few years, you get healthcare for life. You get great loan options for buying a home, and you'll get free college to study something you love. If you go the first responder route after that, then you get veterans preference for hiring and promotions. \n\n\nYou have so much time to figure stuff out and the important thing is to remember you always have options.

When I question what I want to do with my life, I definitely want to sit in an air conditioned room, not physically exert myself, and be paid to think. That sounds _cushy as fuck_. Not every job is an office job. My dad's favorite job of his life was being a forest ranger. To each their own. Pick an environment and culture that matches you. Consider the perspective of what job has a culture you would like.\n\n>Always do what your Boss says\n\nAt a certain level of experience, you have the power to find the job you want. It definitely takes years to build the level of impact. Most of the time, you should enjoy doing what your boss says, because your boss is intelligent and you respect them. They should be saying to do the right things, and you should be agreeing with them; not because it's your job to agree, but because you actually agree.\n\nI'm at this point in my career now. I worked my last job for 2.5 years. My manager changed organizations, and I did not align with his replacement manager's changes to the workplace culture, policies, or the direction he was taking the team. I vocalized my disagreement, and when he reprimanded me for doing so, I left. Up until that point, I was able to voice my concerns about the workplace, because -- as it should be -- your boss is a partner on the job. Together, my managers and I _build_ something: a team, product, business, culture, whatever. I get to contribute ideas and steer development, and the manager (being an equally intelligent individual who is more equipped to balance priorities) can take them into consideration, determine the best line of action, and communicate that decision. With this new management, it was more toxic, and probably what you have in mind as workplace culture. I have the privilege of not having to deal with poor managers: It took me 1 week to arrange 7 interviews, and 3 weeks to accept an offer. I started at my new job last week after vetting the company for a _healthy_ work environment where employees are respected. I look forward to working again where \"doing what the boss says\" isn't a negative thing, because the boss is respectful, intelligent, and considerate of their employees.\n\nUnfortunately for many, such as new graduates, you don't hold this privilege to simply \"work somewhere else,\" especially when low-paying opportunities are so frequently abusive by undervaluing employees. You eventually get there, and it's nice.\n\n>only having the Weekends and 4 weeks per year Off and wasting your life doing the same shit over and over again.\n\nIdeally, you still have time during weekdays for personal endeavors. I try to pursue one hobby each day, even if only for an hour or two. My partner and I do not struggle to fit in an hour of Netflix a day during meals. The weekends are more about \"big projects\" than \"all projects.\" It doesn't represent your only free time ever, but it represents the only free time that can contain larger projects, especially when chores are so time consuming during the week. I'm hoping to soon reach a point in my life where I can hire help for weekday chores, but it's not near the top of my purchase list, but something you could ideally look forward to.\n\nVacation allotment is between you and your company. Every company is different.\n\n>I mean thats One of the most depressing things i've ever heard of\n\nLife is about perspective. The kid upset their action figure is missing an arm is depressed when comparing themselves to their friends and their Brand New Action Figure™. The kid with the same beat-up, broken toy in a third world country has a world of imagination to play with. Appreciating things is hard, and I don't think society has fully adapted to the dopamine-driven, quick-fix blips that the internet has introduced, e.g. via reddit and social media. We get _rapid_ access to small pleasures with humor, news, friends, pornography, chat, et al on demand, and we simply were not evolved to handle this.\n\nWe evolved to hunt and gather food; to go hungry sometimes; to physically work to exhaustion; and to exert blood, sweat, and tears sometimes. To one extent, a life like that may contribute more to our happiness and fulfillment that's missing in modern day society, not through any logical means but through the sheer chemical makeup of our brains. To another extent, humans that lived like that would have _given anything_ to sit in an air conditioned room, not physically exert themselves, and be paid to think.",

I didn't feel like i was making a difference in the world, i felt stagnant, i was depressed and suicidal, i didn't feel challenged or like i was learning in my work anymore. And it showed up in my performance. Ever since I've been in this new position I've felt like a whole new man. It was like i was living under a raincloud that i didn't even know about. The work hours are much more flexible, the work is more creative and challenging, the list goes on..\n\nI do find the traditional 9-5 40 hour work week pretty antiquated and honestly, even in my new position i might do a full 4-5 hours of actual work per day. The rest is spent dicking around on my phone and sitting on the toilet (boss makes a dollar i make a dime...). I think (hope) more up to date companies are starting to realize this and accepting the benefits of a solid work/life balance.\n\nTL;DR: Do something you at least slightly enjoy doing, that you find rewarding and which challenges you to grow as an individual. Try to find a job that offers a flexible schedule. Don't let yourself stagnate and don't feel like you owe your company or your boss a damn thing. Don't take business decisisions personally, and don't expect your supervisors to either.",

I still get to basically do the job of a doctor but get a little more flexibility and didn’t have to go to school as long (at the expense of extra pay, which is worth it to me). And I don’t have too much pride to jokingly call myself an “almost doctor,” although some in my profession would definitely freak out about that. My first job was three 12s one week, four 12s the next. My ideal would be three 12s every week but I’m at four 10s now, which is totally acceptable to me. I am not gonna pretend the job doesnt Carry stress or that I’m always happy, but I do enjoy constantly learning and feel pride when my patients benefit from my intervention or when I’m able to help family and friends. Benefits and time off are pretty good, especially if you get into the right place and work your schedule a little bit. I switched jobs and started per diem (as needed) because I wanted to take trips for a couple of months without worrying about it. So I guess my point is you don’t have to go into medicine, but you can find something that works for you with research and hard work. I know some people face difficult circumstances that prevent that so I’m not implying It’s easy or possible for every person, but this has been my experience so far (I’m 28).",

(Pssst...it's Medicine)\n\nI was depressed as hell during medical school, and even more depressed as an intern. I ended my first two year contract in therapy.  And God, when asked why can't I stop, won't I stop, what's my answer? \n\nBills. Expenses invented by our advanced civilization are the only reason I kill my soul 5.5 to 6 days a week. \n\nI read an article, years ago that contrasted American and European attitudes to work. Americans, it said, thought work should  be a source of purpose and meaning, while the prevailing European attitude is more utilitarian: work is just work. I don't know how relevant these sweeping generalizations are to either group (neither of which is homogenous), but the point stuck with me, and I've been coming to believe it myself. Purpose is, or at least can be, found outside of the work place. A job may be boring, stultifying, meaningless, etc. etc. but the money you earn allows you to take care of the people you love. The fact that you spend so much time working should give savour to your free time. You earned it. You've been looking forward to it! And if you ever had too much time and too little money, or can imagine what that's like, you'll realize that free time, by itself, isn't all that enjoyable. \n\nI mean, if you feel called to professional greatness, go for it. Who says you can't have it all? Start that business. Go back to school. If work must be your source of meaning, then do what you need to do to escape the cubicle. But, the point I hope I've made, is that you can also look elsewhere for your joy. You'll have to be intentional with your free time, since it's limited, but it can be done. Many in our parents' generation cultivated hobbies they were passionate about, dated, fell in love and raised families. If any of this appeals to you, you can go after it too. \n\nAt the risk of sounding cliché, chin up bro and make the best of it, or put in the work and rise above the system. Things suck, but bemoaning that point your whole life doesn't help. Do your best, and let God supply the balance.",

Work with people you like, bad bosses make good jobs bad, and working with people who hate you sucks. You don't have to be best friends with everybody, but one Work place homeboy goes a long way.\n\n3. Use your time off to have a life, not to just take a break. Breaks are important, but if you was all your time off that way, you'll never feel as rested as if you took a week off to see some friends from out of state.\n\n4. Having a life outside of work is more then just sitting at home playing video games, it having friends, working with your community, having hobbies. Life sucks if all your doing is work-home-videogame-sleep-work. Do something at least once during the week, some week it can be all that gets you through it. \n\n5. Avoid the weekend binge, look it's fun to drink on the weekends, and I'm not gonna tell you to never turn up every now and then, but it's just no sustainable.

I know militaries are hated on the internet and reddit especially, and I have my own misgivings and grievances with it after spending years in it.

Start a fantasy league (or a co-ed team) where you work. Do you enjoy gardening? Keep some succulents in your work area, and tend to them during breaks. Do you play RPGs? Volunteer as Dungeon Master and plan your adventures during boring meetings. \nIf you have the means and opportunity, look for another job! One where your interests/opinions are encouraged.

We are not owed an entitlement to have fun with our lives. We've made that easy to assume thanks to a lot of the base survival components have been sourced already - we have access to water, heat, lodging, food, social connection, emergency services, and entertainment pretty easily. \n\nThe flip side to this infrastructure is its cost. To get money you have to do/make things other people are willing to pay for. It's not always fun to do those things, but that's the cost of the convenience for it all. \n\nThere are things you like, and there are things you're good at. Where these things overlap is where you should find a job. Not everyone has (or knows) that overlap, so in that case you might be better off letting you \"good-at\" be work and you \"like\" things be hobbies (or side-hustles). \n\nRemember that life itself isn't entertainment, getting drunk/high, chatting with your social circle, \"hanging out\", playing video games, etc. Life is the stuff that fills the cracks between what you do. Even a sucky job doesn't mean you have a sucky life as long as you don't allow concentrating on the \"sucky feelings\" to consume you. \n\nTo quote the Psycho, of all people, from the Borderlands video game series: \"LIFE...IS... PAIN!\"\nI think about this quote often and have come to really embrace it. Every generation of humans through history has worked their butts off just to survive. At first that might seem discouraging, but keep thinking about it and it becomes encouraging because it means that's what life has already been and yet people find love, art, meaning, and happiness in the midst of it all. \n\nDo what you can to combine what you like with what you're good at, but even if that doesn't work it's ok. Work can suck, but that doesn't mean it doesn't count as time living your life. Every second of your life is a choice.",

There is never 1 true way to “do it right.” It’s about finding what is right for you. At 18 I worked for an Amishman who taught me a craft, by 21 I was a division manager for his nephew and by 23 I was a business owner with employees. There were many aspects of that life I enjoyed, even the work, but that’s all I did. I had no life outside work and I regret that. Covid caused me to live differently and find my money differently. This past 14 months I have been putting in more than a full time job learning skills and not getting paid so that I can live a life more worth living. Some people go against the grain and figure out a way to make their income with fewer hours, though it typically comes with its risks, or make their money after following their passions.  Getting paid for what we enjoy to do (as long as it doesn’t harm others) is what everyone should aim for. But keep in mind, it is called work, you won’t always enjoy it. Your are 18, for you to “buckle in” now and grind some hard, challenging or grueling jobs, is just how it is. The question is, if you don’t have the ability to make money doing something you enjoy now, are you willing to fix that while working a hard job? No one handed a fun job without having the attributes to go with it (unless they are very lucky). But waiting around to get lucky doesn’t deserve anything’s. Those who put in the extra work see results. I’m sorry to say “buck up, put your boot straps on and work” but it sounds like that may be what you need to hear. Not saying that should be or will be all your life. I don’t think it should be for anyone. But most people who have money, a good job, a fun/interesting life did something do deserve it. I guess all in all what I’m saying is life isn’t always sunshine and rainbows, if it was than it would mean nothing. And most the time anything worth having or doing isn’t easy to achieve. So if you don’t want that 9-5 stare at a computer screen job than find another way b.c life is never short of oppertunity. Now go out there and get em!",

People say money can't buy happiness but this isn't the case; not depending solely on a job for income allows you to pursue other things that can make you happy. For this and other reasons, my advice is to seek a financial advisor. Start setting up a retirement/investment plan. What are my goals? What kind of job do *I* want? Can I integrate my hobbies into a career/job, or would that sour my enjoyment of said hobby? When do I want to retire? Ask yourself these and other questions, but don't expect all the answers until you get some work experience. Volunteering, work-studies, etc. helped me answer these questions without having to apply for an actual job. I found a career that I was interested in but it turned out I hated the work, but there was an adjacent career that involves totally different work and I loved it.\n\nBack to the financial side of things, find ways to make your money work for you, don't let all your savings just sit in your bank account as they generally have abysmal interest rates. Find ways to use your money to make more money both short and long term. \n\nThis one might be controversial, because \"dEbt iS bAD!\", but if you can get a credit card and **only** spend it on emergencies, and things that you can afford to pay off of the balance *before* the due date, do it. It improves your credit score over time which will be important if you need a loan later on, and (depending on the bank/card) you won't have to worry about interest since you paid the balance early.\n\nStuff like this might seem obvious to some but it isn't really taught in schools, at least in the U.S. Again, please seek a qualified professional for advice if possible.

These things are easiest to achieve by acquiring and spending money which requires a job. That's the gist of it. What you consider a waste of life is only indicative of your personal values and what you are willing to trade your time for.\n\nBasically, for the vast majority - the 9-5 job is worth it.",

Hobbies can be fun and expensive. I enjoy woodworking, but I can’t make cool shit out of wood without a workshop, or a place to do have one, or fancy expensive wood to make cool shit out of. Going to work and getting a paycheck helps with all of that. \n\nI also enjoy collecting bourbon and other whiskies - that’s an expensive hobby. I’m just getting into it (started taking it seriously as a hobby this year) and I’ve already got north of $3k usd tied up in fancy corn juice in cool bottles.  \n\nLastly, and MOST INPORTANTLY: find a job you don’t hate. \n\nI enjoy working. I like the people I work with, and I find IT security fascinating, which turns my work as an IT security specialist into not a not-entirely-terrible way to spend a good bit of my day regularly. \n\nSure, I’d rather be in the workshop, or drinking whiskey, or shooting clays most days, but I don’t dislike those 8 hour days because I find the work interesting and engaging. Sure, some work days are better than others, but most are pretty good. \n\nA bit off topic but tangentially related here:\nOne thing that might be counter-intuitive to a 16 year old, is that an “Easy” job isn’t necessarily what you should be looking for. Find a way to get paid that you take some degree of interest or enjoyment in and things won’t be so bad. Easy jobs are cool and novel for the first couple weeks or maybe couple months, but you’ll end up bored AF if you don’t do something that makes you think about stuff you find interesting every day.",

I started that career a little late (at around 25) and I had no formal training in fibre storage or color science, but I busted my ass learning as much about everything in my off time and picked up as much OT as possible. Basically any stressful situation or client facing issue, I wanted to be there to get myself as inured as possible to the challenges of the job. \n\nI spent about 2 years of 12+ hour days and managed to go out and have a social life when I could but it was definitely taking its toll. By the end I had picked up a lot from reading/experience and i had managed to get a raise that was contingent on me being available by phone to help the night shift admins with any questions. It was tough getting to work at 8am and getting home at 11pm and then getting a phone call sometime around 3am. \n\nEventually the hours and the generally poor management from execs at that post house became too much and i decided I needed to find a new job. I found one at a commercial VFX house that paid about 20% less but had a much better culture regarding free time and work hours. I loved it but admittedly it got a little boring after another couple of years. I managed to get promoted to a senior position while I was there which was nice and helped me find a new job that paid far better and still allowed me to have free time. That's where I've been since early 2020 and I love it there. I've recently been offered a job at a studio that's longer hours, higher pay, but more importantly will immerse me in more cutting edge tech and workflows (way better for growth as a sys admin). It will be more stressful but at this point I've found a work-life balance that keeps me sane.\n\nLong story short, it really helped me to try out different companies in my field and jump around.

General life advice would be to go out explore and experience life. As time progresses you find a passion for something you can do.\n\nIt really has case by case and contextual but there are some people who do their hobby for a living and others who hate their jobs. It's really about finding every works for you and deciding if you want to pursue your passive as a career or do something else that you can hate less of. The over thing I personally hate is having to do the same thing day in and fast out without any changes in routine. \n\nMyself I have a passion for helping people and computers. The systems I support the projects I complete and the never ending depth of knowledge that I am learning. It would take a lifetime to master them all. And even though I'm not at the forefront bleeding edge of technology it's still moving forward and constantly changing. This is what makes my happy and look forward to getting out of bed in they morning. Sure every job has it's sucky parts but no job would be workout it you would not appreciate the better parts. Also being in a job that encourages your growth, pursuing your passions and pays you enough to support your hobbies outside of work, that will help too. \n\nOne last thing is that when you see beyond yourself like perhaps you know in some way you are helping someone else even if not directly, knowing the job you do could be helping make someone's day better. It gives you a feeling of like you are making a difference. A lot of it is a matter of perspective, but myself since I work with some very important systems that thousands of people use everyday, I feel good knowing that I'm helping in even a small indirect way. By helping keeping those systems and software running. \n\nThe only two jobs I would call is a bottomless abyss is retail and customer service. It's soul crushing and never truly seeing a way forward beyond just thank you have a nice day, go frick yourself Karen.\n\nJust experience some life when you get out of high school OP and try seeing what rings your bell. In high school they only talk about careers and feeding you a structured schedule with very little freedom, but once your an adult making your own choices and schedules try seeing what gets you happy. \n\nHell perhaps not working a 9-5 job, maybe an overnight role or a mid shift 4PM - 12AM role. Second shift jobs give you the ability to enjoy your day somewhat and then get out, if you live In or near a big city.

On weekends you’re studying for tests and have little to no time for other things if you want to stay on top of it.\n\nWhen I’m at work, and this varies greatly depending on where you work or what you do, it’s much more relaxed.

            "text": "Most jobs tend to overwork young people out of school. Ideally you’ll advance in your career to the point where the rigors of the job are financially rewarding or provide perks that make it worthwhile. But there’s a fine line between working hard and being stuck in a rut. Working hard should eventually lead to reward. Working with no reward feels like paralysis. That’s when it’s time to consider looking for new work or asking your management for professional training. \n\nIt’s also a question of asking yourself why you chose the education and career that you chose. Some people expect to work a business job out of school. People get degrees to work for financial institutions that keep you compensated with a fairly uneventful work week. If that’s not for you, it may be time to reevaluate what you wanted out of your education and job training. Maybe there’s another career path that you’d find more rewarding?\n\nKeep in mind that it’s never too late to make a change. It’s a question of how much effort you’re willing to make. Going back to school or training for a new career are hard and intimidating decisions. Talk to a mentor, ask for an informational interview, network with friends or colleagues, etc. \n\nIt’s easy to feel like you’re stuck, but I promise you that if you’re determined, you can find something new. But also… it’s really hard for anybody to do just one thing for years. It’s normal to feel burnt out. Try to make an effort to make time for hobbies. A 9-5 might be boring, but it’s hardly a difficult schedule. You’re lucky if you work a 40 hour week and can support yourself or a family doing it. For a lot of people that’s a luxury. That doesn’t mean you should feel bad about wanting something else, but again, everything in life comes with effort. A very small number of people are born wealthy or have jobs that afford them luxury. Don’t think about them. Think about what you want to do, and then make a plan to do it.",

Find a job that you enjoy doing. Something that makes you strive to be better. You don't want a stagnant office job where you work coppies 9 to 5. Personal growth is N1 priority. Dont settle for \"this works for now\". Find what you like and enjoy doing. Try multiple jobs and workplaces until you find it.\n\n2. Find hobbies. Try different things, sometimes you find a hobby somewhere you never expected to find one. If you like it keep doing it. Hobbies are your lifeline, they make you actually enjoy life, not just your work.\n\n3. Read up on investing and budgeting as soon as possible. Once you get a job make a budget. Try to save money every month, some months you wont be able, but that is OK as long as you keep your budget straight with the things you can predict. Unpredictable things WILL happen. Its part of life, learn to deal with them. After you have figured all those things out and have an emergency fund that you can fall on if shit hits the fan start investing your saved money. Build a diverce portfolio and keep going with your investing strategy. Keep this up and you can retire by the age of 40 easily. \n\n4. DELEGATE TIME FOR YOURSELF. A shit ton of people dont so that, they dont pay attention to themselves and the reach their 30s with the emotional maturity of a 15 yearold. If you can afford it find a therapist. YOU DONT NEED TO BE MENTALLY SICK TO GO TO THERAPY. It helps even with everyday things and having someone you can talk to in a safe place WILL improve your mentallity.\n\n5. Don't forget to dream and have aspirations. People often put their dreams on the shelf just because they have to work. Chase that dream. Make it happen. If it wasn't the right dream, after you fall get up brush the dust off and push forward to the next dream. A man that has stopped having something to look forward to and look up to is a man that put his head in the sand and gave up. DON'T GIVE UP. Shit will look dark at many l, many points but you will push through them and reach that goal you've set.\n\nAnd finally don't let people tell you you can't do something (as long as its legal). Prove yourself that you can. And if you fail get up and keep going. If you proved yourself you can't so something make a mental note and move to the next thing. If you liked the thing try after some time. Maybe it wasn't the time.\n\nYou can do it. Believe in yourself!",

In my experience, a lot of people your age get far too caught up in thinking there is a set a way to live your life, there isn't. There are a lot of different jobs out there in the world and what fits one person may not fit you and that is okay. \n\nIf I had one piece of advice to give, it would be this. Try to figure out what kind of life you want to live and work towards a job that can support it, instead of aiming for some imaginary salary that you think will check the right boxes. Take a good, hard look at the things you enjoy or are passionate about and try to figure out how to incorporate those into your future. That means very different things for different people. Those things can also change over time. \n\nI have friends who are effectively homeless, that just drive around the country while living in a cheap van so that they can enjoy the outdoors. They go from job to job, just making enough money to keep their hobbies afloat. I have friends who have very expensive hobbies such as fly fishing, as well as own homes that is made possible with high level finance jobs. In the first example, you are trading creature comforts and financial security for flexibility and time. In the second example, my friend has traded a lot of time and effort in learning the jobs skills required for his high level job, so that he can earn a wage to support the high standard of living he wanted. These are two very extreme examples but there is a wide spectrum of jobs that exist within that may be able to meet your future standard of living and desires. \n\nOnce you start narrowing down possible careers, the other thing to consider is, how realistic is it to get that job? A common job my students will bring up when looking at the future is a municipal firefighter. In my area, a municipal firefighters would be consider upper middle class to upper class salaries, on top of great benefits and working conditions. The last time a job was open, we had well over a thousand applicants in three hours. It is a tough job to get in a highly competitive field. I'm not trying to discourage you from pursuing an \"unrealistic\" job, but I am just asking you to consider that before entering into training for that field. There is a lot to think about at your age. I just want to reiterate that you are still young and you will learn a ton of new things about yourself in the upcoming years. Your perspective will change as well as your wants and desires. Most of my friends in college didn't even get jobs in what they majored in.

You can still do it, but have other hobbies too that you constantly experiment with so you never feel one dimensional. It’s counterintuitive but when you exercise regularly, you get better at video games too since your reaction time and mental acuity also improve. \n\nAvoiding one dimensionality also implies diversifying away from sports if they are your main hobbies. It’s important to engage with arts, literature, culture (video games included), etc. too since everything you do in your free time channels into your innate ability to be creative and improvise in whatever you are doing in the moment. \n\nThis pays dividends later in life in the form of charisma, confidence, success and all the other ingredients necessary to make you a more badass version of you.\n\nThe secret is to use your free time to diversify yourself and get in touch with your interests. Once you find stuff you actually care about, and I’m talking stuff you aren’t just doing for girls/guys or your future.. Go DEEP. And I mean deep as you can go.\n\nHaving things you pursue for the pure craft of it makes it easier to live a fulfilling life. The craft itself will give you direction and even call to you. The other stuff comes naturally when you build your life around your passions. I mean shit dude, you have ridiculous amounts of free time right now, what are you doing with it? Is it just having the option to do stuff that you like?\n\nAlso your perception of benefits and work life balance isn’t quite spot on. Some bosses are pretty good. Some aren’t. You learn to recognize the shit ones quicker eventually and you use the confidence you’ve cultivated throughout life to draw a line in the sand and find a better job when enough is enough. See how everything in life builds into itself? This is a theme you will encounter over and over as you get older.\n\nIf listening to authority is still problematic when your hormones calm down and your decisionmaking solidifies, you can always turn to freelance work or more individually driven careers. I used to think the “hormones” thing was bullshit. It isn’t. They really cloud your judgement and things will only really feel in control as you exit your mid 20s. That said, you can freely choose your career, work towards it and even shift careers if necessary so no need to worry about choosing too wisely. Part of life is learning to trust your intuition and not worrying about messing up too much.\n\nMost of my friends and I also have somewhere between 10 vacation days + sick leave and unlimited PTO. This goes from hourly pay to 6-7 figure jobs so a pretty diverse perspective. Ironically, the ones with unlimited time off take the least amount of time off. When you include weekends, holidays and faking being sick (yes you still do this as an adult), most people have enough time off to do things with their disposable income that are pretty fun.\n\nAnd the most fun and fulfilling shit in life comes from having disposable income, trust me",

My wife did the chores and child rearing and I went to work.  By the time the evening rolled around we were done and could relax.  The weekend was ours for fun.\n\nNow, we live on the west coast and both have corporate jobs that leave us “always on.”  Most of our time is working or making up for not getting stuff done.  Not much time for fun.  It’s stressful.\n\nThe good thing is we’ve set ourselves up where we can sell our house for a hefty profit, move across the country, and live like kings on only my income (I’ve built a very good career in IT).

This is just my way of doing that.\n\nHaving an education or a good trade helps.  If you’re working crazy hours to make ends meet you’ll have a hard time digging your way out of that hole if stress.  If you can build a good career that you enjoy, it’s much easier to get in a position where you aren’t so stressed and work isn’t such a slog.

My 16 year old ass saved me 5 years of struggles by being a stifler and hard worker. That 5-10 K really helped in buying a house.\n\n5.. Save for and Buy a house. Even if it's a caravan, as long as it is structurally sound. Apart from the rent part, mortgage is money going back in your own pocket.\n\n6. Try to get passive income. Invest in something, preferably something safe like real estate at a good time. Get monthly money to ease the burden.\n\n7. Get a good partner who can help out financially/is willing to work and has a similar mindset. Nothing ruins your life like coming home to a drained bank account while putting hours in.\n\n8. When you have done the climb, you can become fiscally unchained from your boss and your bank and gain the freedom of working less.\n\n9. Actually do so!

I get that.\nHowever, I'm on the other end of the spectrum. I had an attitude like yours, so I dropped out of uni, didn't really apply myself to anything, and switched up jobs quite often (its worth mentioning, I also partied a lot, and to be fair, had a great time). The outcome is that, at age 33, I am now stuck working pretty average hospitality jobs, without much upward mobility. I'm stuck renting, because it's hard to get into the market when you haven't built much behind you. Considering going back to uni, but it's daunting to take on debt knowing you may not get a good foothold in the industry till near 40 (not to mention juggling work and study). Also, would like to be in a steady relationship, and think about starting a family, but most women expect a 33 year old to be a bit further ahead in life (rightfully so).\nSo, I guess my point is this: no matter what you do, you will probably feel some form of regret about something. \nI had some expectation that life was supposed to be 'fun' or something, or that you just have to 'do what makes you happy' but when I think about it, where did I get those ideas from?? Who ever said that? Life certainly wasn't that way for most people in the past. Which isn't to say that there aren't moments of fun, or happiness... that's what you're working for I guess.

If I could tell 16 year old me some things, it would be the things below.\n\nThe “grind”, as I call it, is completely incomprehensible to me now. I hate every aspect of it. I’ve been told “it’ll get better”, “that’s just the way it is”, “just hang in there”. The fuck? How does that help? I’ve admitted myself to the hospital twice within the past year because of self-harm and NO-ONE should EVER have to feel that way. Seek professional help if you do. It’s the only thing that has kept me here.\n\nI’ve read some of the comments to hopefully gain some kind of perspective. There’s insight that could be taken. But mostly, it’s the few who succeeded at their goals and had the money to do so or the ones who are brainwashed by the system.\n\nHere’s my take. \n\nMoney is the worst invention ever made. It’ll be the downfall of humankind. Some will say it’s a “necessary evil”. I say that’s no way to live. The current global system has created an ever increasing divide between those who had the money in the first place and those who didn’t. Yes, I believe that we should go back to a barter and trade system of physical goods and services, not condemned by a small piece of polymer, paper or metal with a number and a face on it. \n\nThe 5-day 40+hour work week is outdated as hell and current employers will be damned if that’s gonna change. ANYTHING that can potentially cut into profits will be fought against. Those that say there isn’t a system to keep you in line is blind as hell to the reality we live in. Work should NEVER be your focus in this life. Oh, the 4 day work week? How is that ANY better? Better productivity and a happier work/life balance? My feelings are no. You’re STILL WASTING 40+ hours a week of your life doing something that probably once started as a passion and fucking fizzled down to something you loathe and can’t stand to look at another second. Don’t believe me? Have a look at Simone Biles. Burnt out and crushed by having to perform at a top level for years. \n\nAs a human, yes, you need something to live for. But, sometimes, you may find that all passions are gone, like I am currently experiencing. The only time I feel at peace is when I’m alone, away from every aspect of society. \n\nI decided in my late teens I would never have kids. Knowing how I was as a child, I wouldn’t be able to handle the stress. That’s something you can’t get out of. Wear a condom. I had surgery to eliminate any possibility of that happening. Kids are expensive and things aren’t getting cheaper. \n\nIf you’re thinking of getting married, you better live with that person for a few years to find out if your living styles compliment or clash. What are you looking to get from this life? Does it align with what they want/expect? \n\nYour passions and life goals are going to change as time goes on. If there’s a few skills I wish I had learned back when I was ~16, it’s this:\n\n-Grow and catch your own food.\n-Make fire without a lighter or matches.\n-Build your own home.\n-Source your water, make every drop count and purify it for drinking.\n-Live on your own and discover who YOU are?\n-Find YOUR place on this planet that allows you to “switch off”. I mean an actual, physical place you can go. I’m still searching but I know I’m on the right path.\n-Blood is NOT thicker than water. Family are those dearest to your heart, not necessarily the ones that brought you into this world nor grew up with. People come and people go. \n\nOP, I hope I made some kind of point. I’ve re-read my reply and maybe I gave some sort of insight. Take it for what you will though. This is the internet/Reddit after all. I hope you find peace in this mad world cause there is beauty here. I empathize with your views. \n\nAs for any replies to this, unless it’s OP, I won’t be responding. I’m not gonna debate, converse, or defend MY views and opinions. This was already beyond difficult for me to type out and I don’t have the energy.",

He would carve every single bead, polish the beads by putting them into a bag with bugs and rolling it around with his feet, then putting the abicus together without any nails needed.  The thing was absolutely, stupendously beautiful.  Made by a true expert level craftsman.  Who in the hell grows up ever thinking they want to work their entire lives making abicuses for 60+ years?  When they asked the guy why he kept working, he simply said that we wanted to make the perfect abicus.  He said it's impossible to make the perfect abicus, but every day he works he gets closer to the ideal of perfection.  A man driven by the pursuit of perfection that he can never achieve.

            "text": "Easy! It's just about scheduling and making the time when the time suits you I mean 9-5 is EASY to work around! \n\nI work 2 jobs 64 hours a week at 6 days a week Sunday is my only FULL day off (leave the house at 5:30, job 1 is 6-13:00, 4 hour break, job 2 is 17:00-20:00, and Saturday is just job 1 6:00-10:00) but every day between jobs I make a point of doing something social, whether its lunch date with a friend, going to the cinema, going to the gym and socialising there, then when I get home at 20:30-21:00ish I game with friends every other night! I know \"gaming\" might not be seen as a \"social life\" but some of my personal best friends are people I've never met outside of the servers and other friends I have in real life can only fit their social lives around game nights so I have dedicated days for dedicated games. \n\nThe nights in between I spend with my partner and we'll do whatever we fancy whether its going out for a walk or staying in cuddled up with a crap movie. Saturdays after work I get home have a quick nap to recharge my batteries and then I make the most of the weekend! I play in a pub cover band (which is finally making a comeback now Covids dying down in my area) so I gig at weekends quite often, I meet up with other friends that want to socialise but can only do it at weekends, sometimes we'll go to the local arcade, a cafe, the beach is a stones throw away we can do anything! \n\nSo yeah it's honestly all about taking a serious look at your life schedule and thinking \"what do I WANT to do, who do I WANT to see and how can I MAKE it fit into my regular life schedule?\" I'm aware that this might seem a bit much/hectic for some people but hey just saying if I'm working these hours and have what I feel is a pretty decent social life compared to other people then you've got no excuse for not finding the time in your own life at 9-5!\n\nTheres a speech from Arnie that made me realise this was very achievable where he's talking about hours in the day when people say they don't have time to work out but says it's not strictly limited to working out it can be any passion, hobby, or want that you have and it's something along the lines of.\n\n \"There are 24 hours in the day so don't tell me you don't have time to exercise! You need 6 hours of sleep a day so let's take that away but most people want 8 so let's go with that, after sleep you have 16 hours left of your day, you work a 9-5 job that's another 8 hours, there's STILL 8 whole hours left in your day! Now let's take travel into account, the average person takes half an hour to get to their job but let's go with longer let's say it takes you an hour there and hour back, you still have 6 hours left of your day! I know we have chores to do, meals to make and clothes to wash but you don't do all of those every day but let's humour the idea! Let's take off another 2 hours which is more than enough time and something you're not gonna be doing every day, you got 4 hours left still, 4 hours left and that's with the benefit of the doubt you're getting a full 8 hours sleep spending 2 hours a day travelling and 2 hours a day doing housework every single day which isn't the case! Why can't you read some of that book you're enjoying in that 4 hours? Why can't you go to the gym? Why can't you get together with that friend for a beer you haven't seen in months? And that's 4 hours every day, after a week if you worked every single day which you don't! That's almost 30 hours! Even if you just took an hour a day out of that to read and learn something or exercise after a year that's 365 hours of knowledge and training do you realise how much smarter and or stronger you'd be after all that? There's no such thing as 'I don't have the time' because you DO you just need to realise it and then something about it!\"\n\nI probably butchered that but that's why I'm not Arnie but it really resonated with me and made me realise even with my longer than average work week I CAN make time to go to the gym, socialise with friends, and do the things I enjoy and you can too!",

And i never had problems with my co workers from the beginning so coming to work was always enjoyable socially.\n\nI spent so long trying to convince my boss that i could do my job from home, but when covid came, i actually missed my office. I actually realized that although its nice to have the option to work from home once in a while, that coming in to the office once in a while is actually healthy for the mind.\n\nmy only real problem with my job is that i think i could do what they want me to do in like half the time.",

Or they can be a trap and leave you with a terrible standard of living and a gaping hole in your life.\nIt's up to you to dive in and try to find what gives you the satisfaction that makes the 40 hour week make sense. Perhaps it is gardening and hunting like a person from 1000 years ago, but perhaps it is organizing the office kitchen and tweaking PowerPoint slides amongst a group of odd but compatible coworkers.",

The second has a career. The third has a calling.  \n\nIn the parable of the bricklayers, everyone has the same occupation, but their subjective experience, how they themselves viewed their work, couldn’t be more different.  \nIt’s not that some kinds of occupations are necessarily jobs and others are careers and still others are callings. Instead, what matters is whether the person doing the work believes that laying down the next brick is just something that needs to be done, or instead is something that will lead to future success or connects the individual to something far greater than self. Your work can go from job to career to calling without changing the occupation.  \n\n> A lot of people assume that what they need to do is find their calling. I think a lot of anxiety comes from the assumption that your calling is like a magical entity that exists in the world, waiting to be discovered. A calling is not some fully formed thing that you find, it’s much more dynamic. Whatever you do, whether you’re a janitor or the CEO, you can continually look at what you do and ask how it connects to other people, how it connects to the bigger picture, how it can be an expression of your deepest values.  \n- Amy Wrzeniewski",

I work jobs that I care deeply about, that give me a sense of purpose and accomplishment, and that I legitimately love to do. \n\nRight now I work 9-5 as a therapist dealing with issues around sex, sexuality, gender, relationships, etc (all things I find very interesting). Before this I worked 9-5 helping people escape human trafficking and get access to the resources and supports they need. Just because the bulk of my work happens in a standard 8 hour day doesn’t mean it needs to be boring or monotonous or pointless. I choose jobs that I WANT to work at and that I get a sense of pride and accomplishment from.\n\n I also continue to develop skills and seek out education so that I don’t need to stay stagnant if a job is starting to feel monotonous. Going back to school to get my masters allowed me to start working as a therapist, something I couldn’t do when I just had a bachelors. I also take professional training which is purposeful and in line with my goals so I can keep developing my career in a way that is interesting to me. \n\n9-5 isn’t the only work model out there, and it’s not for everyone, but it works for me. I’m able to balance the work that I love to do with evenings to spend with my family and weekends to get out of the house and socialize with friends or take part in hobbies and activities. Having a consistent and predictable schedule makes it easy to plan my off time and working 40 hours a week means I have enough money to live a lifestyle that is comfortable.\n\nThat’s how I’m able to work a 9-5 and know I’m not wasting my life.",

For example make music, write novels, help others, make video games, play sport, develop an app, start a business...whatever it is.  Pursue that passion and it won't feel like work, and likely wont end up 9 to 5, 5 days a week.\n\nQuestion everything.  Read books and watch talks by people you respect and see how they did it.  Mix with successful and motivated people. Volunteer. A good network is vital.\n\nAppreciate you don't need to be rich to be happy - trying to make big $ and taking a job you hate to do it is not a pathway.  Buying a new car will not make you happy. NOT going to that shit 9 to 5 every day - THAT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY.\n\nWhile you are young don't get caught up in the idea of needing the latest and greatest everything.  Spend less so you don't have to work as much and use that time to pursue your passion or study your passion.\n\nRethink whether university is the right path to follow your passion.  If it is, aim for a top uni and work hard, but look for ways to reach the same outcomes without the burden of student debt.\n\nAccept you may need to to work some shit jobs in your twenties while you build your passion, but that finding it and becoming good at it is the way to escape the grind of a job you hate.\n\nAccept that even when you find your passion, and are paid to to do it, there will still be days where it all seems too hard.

Work hard, play hard. Have reasonable expectations in what can be done at home with such limited time. Keeping up with appearances is rather overrated. Focus on what is important to you. Right now week nights are rather routine....get home, dinner, play with my kid and enjoy the shit out of it. After the kid is in bed, get everything ready for the next day, shower, spend a few hours with wifey. I average about 5 hours of sleep which works pretty well for me surprisingly. After the half day on Saturday, its get caught up on home and car maintenance (cutting grass, cleaning, general hubby-to-do items) before making it a fun evening with the fam. Sunday is mostly the lazier chores like laundry so its the more chill day but also the day to get out and adventure or do more of a day thing all together.  This varies from week to week of course as things arise, small events come up and always seasonal/weather depending.\n\nYes, there are times this absolutely sucks and go down a dark path in my mind over missing so much. I justify (or atleast talk myself into this reason) by seeing the life I am providing for my girls (wife and daughter) and gearing everything towards an earlier retirement...50's maybe. I dont have good answers OP but this is the life/game we play in a capitalistic/consumerism country. I wouldnt know what to do if I had all the time in the world - also - everything costs money...if you aren't brining it in, how can you justify wanting or doing more with what you don't have. It's like a barriers of entry thing in my mind. Nonetheless, I work and proudly work knowing my girls want for nothing and I still find plenty of time for fun - both with my little fam and on my own.

There are a couple different philosophies here and you need to choose what feels right to you. \n\nPhilosophy 1: you are going to spending a significant portion of your life doing this, so make sure it's something you love, regardless of the money it gets you. I followed this route and I have lots of student debt, and a job that doesn't pay a lot (teaching) but that I love and take a lot of pride in. For me, the debt is worth it, but I'm only 28, I don't want kids and I haven't even looked into buying a house yet. However, because I followed what  I'm passionate about, I've had amazing experiences and don't regret or feel that I've \"wasted\" any time. \n\nPhilosophy 2: get money, and do whatever your passionate about on the side. Don't believe for a second that money doesn't buy happiness (seriously, it's hard to be happy when you can't afford the food you want or a decent apartment), so get that stuff sorted first and foremost. Chances are, if you work in something you love, you'll grow to hate it anyway. The risk here is that you might end up feeling like you're wasting your life.\n\nThe truth is that there are people who followed their passion and now regret living a life where they can't find a job that pays well and that there are people who followed the money and feel empty. There are also people who followed their dreams and are immensely happy and fulfilled, and those who pursued well- paying jobs that are completely happy and fulfilled.\n\nIt's a game we're all trying to figure out. Best of luck to you!",

If you are outside of work, do the same thing. Do not get trapped by the lie that work is meaningless from some outside, objective standard: only you can make your meaning out of the life you are given.\n\n\"Meaning\" doesn't equate to seeking happiness and pleasure as the route to meaning. Many wealthy people who don't work feel that their lives are meaningless, many retired people struggle to find meaning without work, and many people who just grind video games and Netflix after their workdays feel that their lives are meaningless, too. They're all right, because their mindsets lead them to place meaning in the price of things (rich people), to live in the future or past instead of the present (retired people), or to devalue and waste their time (the grinders).\n\nThere's a saying, \"do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life.\" This is a decent start; you'll pursue jobs that align with your interests. However, the truth is different: love what you do and you'll never work a day in your life. You choose to love — it's a mindset — and you can love saving lives on an operating table or soldering tiny components on a factory floor. It's your choice to love what you do.\n\nRead Man's Search for Meaning, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Tom Robbins \"Still Life with Woodpecker,\" any Buddhism text, and Camus'\"The Myth of Sisyphus\" to gain perspective.",

I often catch up on work on the weekend. I'm not forced to do this, I do it out of intrinsic motivation. However, I care exactly zero about my title or status. I'm also an introvert and don't like leading people.  But I DO enjoy being very competent at my job, and get a thrill out of my accomplishments. I like setting goals and then achieving them. It's often hard work and not joyful in the moment (like going to the gym) but at the end of the week/month/year, it brings me deep satisfaction, and I would call that real happiness (also like exercise - long term deep benefits).\n\n\nI don't know how or why I feel like that - but I do think there are three prerequisites that you need to be in place to make it possible: (A) you enjoy the core function of the work and it matches your personality and strengths (for example, I'm an introverted analytical person so could never work in sales),  (B) you have enough autonomy day-to-day that you feel “in control of the ship”, and (C) if you do succeed at the job, it will be rewarded - usually that means you will be paid more, but for non-profit and advocacy work it might mean objectively better outcomes for others.\n\n\nIf one of those three elements are missing, then its very easy to fall into \"who gives a shit\" territory.",

If you do something with love and passion, you'll eventually get better at it, and if you get good enough at something you can make a living out of it. \n\n\nHaving said that, in my current job there's a mix of reasons:\n\n+ I love what I do *and* I do what I love. I *am* a Designer (and I work as a Visual and Digital products one) so I enjoy tackling problems and it helps knowing that on Mondays ill get back to do something I'm passionate about. :)\n\n+ Don't have bosses, have leaders. On the same regard, don't have coworkers, have teammates. Finding a place to work with great work culture and talented people is very much doable. Don't stay in a place that forces you to do stuff, go to a place that empowers you to do stuff. (this last thing can be applied to so much)\n\n+ This might be cheating, but I have flexible hours. The '9 to 5' is just one of many options as a work scheme. If you work by objectives, your work day could be 10 hours long or 3 hours long. It'll depend on your ability to create value for people. \n\n+ I don't believe there's just one truth, everybody is different and their ways of going through live doesn't necessarily apply to you, and the other way around (thank you Assassin's creed). So I didn't buy into the 'your work doesn't have to make you feel good, it has to make you money' stuff. I now do something I love and make pretty good money in the process. \n\n\nOpen your mind, I know you're very young at 16, but always be wary that the world is huge, and nobody around you (well, probably) have experienced enough to say categorically what's what. Everybody comes from their own experience, so take their approach to work life with a grain of salt. It seems to me that your context tends to make you believe working is only doing an activity on weekdays from 9 to 5 that makes you miserable. If you go about life with that mindset you'll definitely condition yourself to end up exactly like that. \nHole this helps. Gonna get back to work, now. :)",

Evenings (if there's a place with 3 shifts) would be something like 2-to-11 and nights would practically be dayshifts w/ AM<-->PM. 9-to-5 implies only 8 hours a day with a *paid* lunch, which is **very** rare.\n\nAlso, at least for many people, getting 4 weeks off in a year is also a myth. Closer to reality is 0-2 weeks. \n\nNow that those points are out of the way, life is what you make of it. An office job is only a pointless grind if you allow it to be -- prove to be an asset to your company and work your way up the ladder, or if your employer won't recognize you, then find a new place to work. Same goes for physical labor -- help the company get better (read: improve **yourself** first and let *that* improvement help the company) and if they won't recognize/reward your contribution in a way you feel is fair, then find a new place to go.\n\nReal life is savage, and while many people are willing to lend out a hand and help, know that there are many more who are looking to either use you to their own benefit, or sabotage you altogether. Avoid the latter -- they see being a bottom-dweller as an inevitability and revile those who might actually rise above them. Get a clear idea of what you want and go after it. \n\nThat said, remember you are mortal and you have a life to live. This is not an excuse to solely chase pleasure or leisure in a hedonistic binge, but rather to find a balance for your career. This is where hobbies come in -- they, essentially are \"work light\", something you can put energy into for enjoyment/recreation, but at the same time can be used to generate some side revenue (ie, woodworking, mechanic work, lawn care, etc).\n\nThe \"trick\" to it all is to **NOT** think of work as a prison sentence (\"I have to go to work to get $$$\"). Think of work simply as spending time performing tasks instead-- you go to the office/workplace/your career as your primary income earner; you wrench on your car to make it faster or save money on repairs; you carve ornate trim to make beautiful furniture; you sculpt your landscaping to improve your home's value; etc.\n\nFinally, just know that the world will do everything in its power to break you.

In my experience, this diminishes the ability to take chances in life to make it whatever you want it to be.\n\nSo find a passion, find something you are interested in, find something that you can grown in.  And the start your own vision of what that is.  You're going to fail.  Don't worry about that.  Embrace your failures, they're your sponsors.  Don't be afraid of what you're going to lose.  There is a lot more you don't even know that you're going to gain.  Do it today.  Get started right now.  \n\nBTW, this wasn't written for you.  This is written to my past self.

Most people not all but statistically speaking MOST people get up around 5:30am. Leave the house before 6:00am. Start work at 7:00am. Work until anywhere between 4:30pm-5:30pm. And likely get caught in traffic and don't get home till 6:30pm.  So realistically they're out of the house for 12 to 14 hours a day. 5 days a week. And if you work in say construction. There's no vacation, in Canada your vacation pay in construction is generally added on to your weekly pay. 4-6%. But you don't get paid sick days or vacation,  so if you don't work, then you don't get paid. \n\nIn manufacturing its a bit different but most people only get 2 weeks off a year and maybe.  I'm not forgetting Xmas holidays, but alot, most places work right up until the 23rd,  and if the break between  Xmas and new years is during the week often times people are off 24,25,26. Back to work 27th till the 30th.  Then off till the 2nd.\n\nI understand your post.  But life is SOOOO much worse then you think.",

One thing I have learned over my career that helps mitigate that feeling is to condition yourself you to wake up early everyday and make good use of the time you have. If you have to be at work by 9am wake up at 430am or 5am and use that time to go to the gym, go for a walk,  get some grocery shopping done, study for a better job, or knock out a few chores. It wont feel like all you do is work and sleep through the week. \n\nPersonally, Im a 5 to 6 hour of sleep a night sort of person. I know not everyone can function like that but if you find yourself waking up at 3 or 4 in the morning wide awake and force yourself back to sleep only to feel groggy all day I suggest just starting your day when you wake up.

Ofcourse most people are not lucky enough to start like  this, but you can work your way there while you have your job. You start thinking in terms of your own life and focus on how to make money in everything you are interested in, then take logical risks and try to get your own financial freedom.\n\nFor me it was learning trading, after 10 years of stable engineering job, i quit my job and now trading with the money i have saved over the years, now sometimes what i make in a day is larger than what i made in a year, though remember there is a reason that most people dont like this approach, because it involves risk. its not a set way of making a fixed income like a regular job, i made more money that i could save in my life and lost ( also one of the biggest misconception is that you stable job is safe) But the thing is you work for yourself and nothing goes to waste, the amount you invest in yourself is the amount you will have opportunities and gains in return.\n\nSome people have different approaches, some do real estate, some do amazon arbitrage trading etc etc but the most of them have the same final destination  personal financial freedom and a ticket out of this wicked system.",

You’ll be lucky to find one at the start of your career where you’ll get more than 2-3 weeks PTO, and ideally you’ll want to find a WFH job so you’ll have more freedom in how you work, but even then it’s doable, and it gets better as time goes on (always change jobs once it stops getting better).\n\nBut with kids, there is no escape. None. You work your 9-5, and you then have to (if you are a good parent at least) immediately go into parent mode. Diapers and doctors for the first few years, then you’ll be taking them to and from school, their extracurricular activities, their friends—etc. You’ll help them with school, stay up for them when they stay out late for the first time, teach them to drive and then worry about them driving, help them with homework—and I haven’t even talked about the crazy financial burden kids are and the stress that can cause. \n\nYou’ll have very little time for yourself and with your spouse, especially in the beginning. It truly will be: wake up, work, parent, go to bed, repeat.\n\nIf you instead don’t have kids, you’ll be able to live pretty freely. Go out on a week night with some friends to dinner or a movie. Take 3-4 day weekend trips to a far off city because you can. If you get a WFH job, you can stay up pretty late and still get 8 hours of sleep. You’ll have plenty of time for your hobbies and your spouse. And to be able to afford this freedom, you’ll need 2 incomes—so you’ll really want to have a spouse who can also work.\n\nThis is not to say that everyone SHOULDN’T have kids. But having kids is often the “default”, and it shouldn’t be. It’s a massive commitment and why a lot of people are miserable. Many people shouldn’t have had kids and others accidentally did so now they are not just stuck with kids but also stuck with a spouse they no longer love. Very dark statement, but it’s true and people don’t talk about it like ever.\n\nYour parents may pressure the shit out of you to have kids—think about it, truly, and then decide for yourself. Not everyone is fit to be a parent nor is everyone financially stable enough to support a kid(s) in 2021. Also, considering how shitty the world is right now, I don’t feel comfortable bringing a kid into it.\n\nProbably an alternative answer, but not having kids will truly give you the freedom and income to live a full life.",

It might involve more hours when you're young, but it will set you up with many more options as you get older. At that point, you can start being pickier and making tradeoffs between hours and pay.

I had an opportunity to apply for a position with a very large telecommunications company working in an office setting. I took that opportunity and worked both jobs for nearly 5.5 years. I am now almost 2 decades into that office job and LOVE it. I am at my second position with that company, I love my boss and my peers, the buck stops with me, I have to know the answers to issues, I have no one to kick the can to as it were. I also have the luxury of working full time at home since before Covid started and I'm loving it. I also get nearly 30 days off yearly, which when it comes to working at home feels like a HUGE number.\n\nThat said, I went through a decade of shit at the office job in a call center environment for commercial business support. It was challenging and I liked that. The pay was ok, but after almost 20 years I can say I make very decent money. Couple that with a 2 income household we can live VERY comfortably, buy what we want when we want to, not have to stress over mortgage and bills etc. \n\nIt all comes down to what do you enjoy in life, what would you like to do? I am not talking WORK here, I mean hobbies. RC vehicles, models, biking, hiking, gardening, etc. Etc. Find employment that allows you to be able to have time for those hobbies as well as being able to financially. \n\nI know some people that have a passion and that is what they want to do. My take on it, do something that allows you to DO that passion without having to worry about how to support yourself. Let's use music as an example. If you want to play music professionally and sell albums, have a 9-5 that allows you to exist, then do the music as a hobby. Some people go with the \"my music will support me\" and that's a great attitude and all, but is it realistic? Not every person or band that wants to sell albums is able to make money doing that right at the start. I have personally seen the stress of that chew people up and spit then back out and seem to lose that passion. I have an in-law that does the 9-5 route, still also plays music in a solo career and with bands, has albums out and LOVES it. \n\nFind your passion, follow your passion. That said, some people say if you love what you do you will never work a day in your life. Others say if you work in something you are very passionate about that it can become very stressful and you can lose that passion if you were to do something professionally versus being able to do it as a hobby or for fun. \n\nEveryone is different, I hope you are able to find your path in life.",

It is for plenty of people, super depressing, but it is all a matter of perspective.

A 9 to 5 can get you there safely and soundly, and there are plenty of folks out there that need that stationary stable situation, especially like those with kids and needing stable schedules and sick leave and insurance and all that comes with a 9 to 5. \n\nBut you’re 16!!

Getting off the fucking couch applies to all forms of work, not just the 9 to 5. \n\n(Ps. Me personally, working as a nurse, 3 days a week, plus occasional on call hours.

We are born, our parents barely have time to spend with us the first few years (cus they're usually in their 20s, have to work all the time to make a career and to accomodate the new need in the family) Then we go to school for 13+ years (add a few if you go to uni), some things are ok, others we feel forced to and hate cus we know already from a young age that we don't want to work with it in the future. Then we come home with a bunch of homework so school doesn't end for the day even when you head home. And if your parents are eager to make things in life go well for you they'll likely help you with your homework and home school you after they get hom from work. After your long education to become \"a contributing member of society\", aka. a specialist that haven't learned any other way of surviving than selling your time and workforce for 8 hours a day you are off to care for yourself by doing exactly that. Where I live you get less than 66% of what your labor is worth. 33% are directly removed even before you get your payment, and everything you buy with what remains have an additional 25% extra added to the orginal price in taxes. The banks make sure to lend you money for your studies and your first new place to live like the good commrades they are, and like that they have you right where they want you, indebted. Then you have to work and pay them back what you gain for decades to come. It's a type of slavery you're lured into when young really. You then spend 50 years doing a 9 - 5 (if that's enough) before you retire (and they gradually push the retirement age to make us work longer in our aging bodies, despite the lack of work for young people). Once you retire you get a fraction of what you originally got each month and a few happy years before you're so old that you can't enjoy it anymore, and the politicians secretly wish you die soon cus the longer you live in this stage, the more you cost. Then the kids of the next generation fall into the same trap and so it repeats... \n\nI'm convinced if we knew how to do everything on our own that's needed to survive, we would only spend a fraction of the time we do now on work each day, and the work we do would feel more fulfilling as you are your own employee and everything you do would be for your own and your family.",

You know, the whole \"Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life\" myth. And most people don't ever attain that. But many continually try. \n\nAfter college I floated about listlessly, hoping for some opportunity to arise for me to work in my liberal arts field. I fancied dreams of travel and adventure, and it would keep me up at night. But life did it's things and it became necessary for me to find a big boy job or face homelessness. While that job had its own problems and I've since left it, it really helped me realize how essential money is to enjoying life. You heard me. Money is A (not the) key to happiness. Within a year of having my big boy job, I was able to begin an adventurous life of world travel. And I could afford it with relative ease. I didn't and don't currently make a lot of money, but travel is cheap if you don't need extravagance. \n\nSo what's my answer? The value of a job/income is relative. Maybe I could make six figures if I worked 60 hours a week for years. But I would never do that because it would ruin my life. Now I make a relatively modest wage but live an exceedingly comfortable life, where I'm free to spend my time as I wish. Don't be afraid of work.

I use that to save or travel.\n\n-I found a partner who comes from wayyy more money than me who also pursues what he loves, but also has more money and will inherit money too. I love him of course, but the comfort of knowing this allows us to make slightly different decisions. We don't live like kings, but we also aren't stressed.\n\n-I do not and never will have kids. I don't like them, but also having kids means working 4x as hard and having way more long term financial responsibilities. I can always pick up my life, pivot, do something new. I never feel stuck. I can make less financially sound decisions like charging a trip to a credit card and paying it off later because it doesn't matter.\n\n-Instead of kids, I work how I want, I volunteer and I engage with art, music, and performance in the city and travel. \n\n-I never have debt. And I don't have a car or rent that is above my means.\n\nEven if my partner left me, I am not and never will be concerned about money. I can always get work in service if necessary.

I don't plan to \"retire.\" I am privileged to live in a rich country (the US) and come from upper middle class so I can make sure my life is fun and uncomplicated.

A lot of times it was difficult to quantify how whatever I did helped the world but with patients in our hospital I don't have to look far to see where improvements can make for a happier patient or patient's family. \n\nRemember, and this is key, **the reward for hard work is hard work**.  If you put in effort it will, in all likelihood, be rewarded not only with more difficult work but with autonomy to go along with it.",

For example - the commute. It’s sure-fire way for a job that’s supposed to take up 8 hours of your time in a day to actually take up 10. \n\nI’ve been working from home for almost a year and a half now and honestly, I never realized the extent to which having a work day bookended by sitting in traffic on the beltway for an hour takes my energy away and takes the pleasure out of my lifestyle. I find that actually working exactly 8 hours is a bit more manageable for me, and it was those extra hours on the road turning work into a 10-11 hour day at a previous job that really made me feel zombie-like. \n\nObviously working from home is not an option in every line of work, but I know a lot of fields are becoming increasingly flexible with that. And if remote isn’t an option either due to the field or your preference - definitely consider the commute and logistics of getting there. I really think, for example, that the difference an hour in traffic vs fifteen minutes in traffic every day makes to your happiness (and your wallet) is HUGE over time.  Work is still work of course, in that even though I do generally enjoy my job, I’d still rather be off for the day than working. There are probably very few people who don’t feel that way, I imagine. But I don’t dread the week and preemptively feel exhausted on Sunday night in the same kind of way I used to. And I really think a key difference is that without commuting and traffic I have about three more hours to myself in a day than I would have otherwise.",
