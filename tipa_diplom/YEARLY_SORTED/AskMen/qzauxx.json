    "Turning 33, what’s something (materialistic) every guy should buy himself in his 30s?\nObligatory front page Edit:  there’s a lot of suggestions here and I appreciate everyone’s inputs! It’s gonna take me a bit to read through these but so far I see a recurring theme of quality over quantity.  I think my favorite is a club membership over a gym, I never really thought about taking advantage of the amenities of one.\n\nEdit 2 electric boogaloo: apparently a lot of guys like watches. I’m not much of a watch fan but I agree it’d be nice to have at least one nice watch to wear occasionally (currently just use an Apple Watch)": [

            "text": "I think the appropriate answer for you really depends on what your life is like. If you’re well-off, debt free, and have a decent retirement account, splurging for an exotic vacation or a luxury car is probably a good way to celebrate 33. \n\nIf you’ve got student loans, living paycheck to paycheck, and an unexpected $1000 expense will threaten your ability to pay for essentials, something like an affordable but quality watch or a nice suit is probably the right answer. \n\nSo in ascending order of need based on your circumstances: \n\n1.\tA quality affordable watch, I’d recommend a citizen, seiko, Hamilton, or orient as brand starters. Hell you can even find quality Casios if that’s your style. \n2.\tA fully stocked home bar. Have 1) a bottle of red wine, 2) a bottle of white wine, 3) bottle of whiskey, 4) a bottle of tequila, 5) a bottle of rum, 6) a bottle of vodka, 7) simple syrup, 8) bitters, 9) lemon and lime juice, 10) various mixers, 11) a book of cocktail recipes, and 12) the tools to make some basic cocktails. Depending on how much you have to start out, and the quality of what you buy, you could go from nothing to fully stocked in under $500. \n3.\tA nice, tailored suit. I say navy blue for your first, charcoal for the second, then interesting colored or patterned blazers beyond that: maroon, brown, green. One suit is a must and is flexible for weddings, work events, holiday parties, etc. \n4.\tA proper set of kitchen knives. No more of the 4 knives for $20, 17 knives for $50 Walmart/Target sets. Shun, Wusthof, Victorinox all great brands with beautiful knives. \n5.\tQuality grill and/or smoker. Cooking your own meats is a fun and useful skill to have. Plus allows you to be the guy hosting holiday barbecues and game day grill outs so there’s a major social element to owning this type of product. \n6.\tWall art and plants. Your apartment/house walls should not be barren and it shouldn’t be covered in miscellaneous bikini posters, rock band posters, quirky Einstein quotes and photos. If it was on your dorm room wall, you probably shouldn’t still be hanging it. Owning prints of art you like and plants show that you’re 1) responsible because you’re able to keep plants alive and 2) have your own interests and personality. \n7.\tHave quality sporting equipment or a membership. Whether it’s a nice road bike, a monthly yoga membership, or a full health club with pools and saunas and basketball courts. Keeping yourself healthy is something beyond value.  \n8.\tGo on a memorable vacation, not a staycation, not somewhere you’ve been before, and not somewhere within normal driving distance of your home. Get on a plane, go somewhere and make memories. Pick a beach, a mountain to hike, a museum you’ve always wanted to visit, or city to go acclimate yourself to. Go and do it. Now. \n9.\tBuy a new car. It doesn’t need to be a luxury vehicle. But you shouldn’t be driving around in the beater you got for $1800 in high school/college. Your ride should be reliable and nice enough you aren’t ashamed to have passengers. \n10. Treat your family and/or friends on a vacation. Rent a house, get that fancy suite on the strip, rent out rooms in a resort, etc. Time in your 30s with your friends is priceless. And if you can afford it, cutting the costs for everyone else opens doors to spend time with people you might not otherwise get a chance to.",

I don't personally know you or what things you like.\n\nSomething I can always advice is a nice set of quality tools. And if you like fixing things on any scale(it be electronics, it be furniture or anything like that), maybe invest in some small workplace/workbench/workshop. Doesn't have to be much, it can just be a table made against a wall with some holds for your tools on that wall. Just be sure not to clutter it. Maybe get a tablet or computer there aswell.\n\nThere's always things around the house, in your bag or pockets, or inside your garage that will need some fixing-up. Having a place to be able to do that is always nice, and being able to look up how to do it, like, on youtube or the internet, is always a plus.\n\nFixing your car yourself on the weekend can be much cheaper than fixing it at a mechanic, and it won't be too long until you have repaired so many things on your own that the cost of your tools/workplace is justified. Plus you get the technical knowledge.\n\nAnd other men reading this: it's never too late to learn repairs, and it doesn't just apply to men above 30. Anyone can do a lot of repairs themselves.  \n\n\nHere's some ideas in a pastebin(to prevent a giant comment!): [https://pastebin.com/fVXYzsN0](https://pastebin.com/fVXYzsN0)\n\nsorry if my comment wasn't clear, but I hope it helps!",

Silk prevents tugging on the skin and does not draw moisture away from the skin like cotton does, so keeps you looking younger. Also less stress on the hair. \n\nA bidet with remote control. Multiple settings, heated seat, night light and warm air fan for drying. Once you have one you’ll realize it’s a necessity, not a luxury. Plus you’ll use far less toilet paper. \n\nOk; this one is a luxury but if you spend a lot of time in your car, get one with massage seats. One that does the full back and legs. Nothing better for long drives. I can’t possibly go back to regular seats now. Throw in heating and cooling and you’ll keep your ass very happy. \n\nSkincare. A proper cleanser, serum and moisturizer with SPF. I’ve been taking care of my skin since I was a teenager. I’m nearly 44 and get carded trying to buy beer. Never too late to start - 50 year-old you will thank you. \n\nA smoker. Look into a Rectec. \n\nA Yeti cooler. Keeps drinks cold on scorching days and you can rest a brisket in it for 4 hours and still scorch your hands on it. \n\nQuality tools. \n\nWhen buying anything, do it right the first time and buy quality. I learned that from my parents. Far less expensive in the long run.\n\nAnd knives. Can’t believe I originally forgot to mention knives.

I've found a few $3k suits that only needed about $100 in tailoring and they'll last you a lifetime if you take care of them.  \n\n\nAlso a good leather jacket in a classic style - removable insulated liner if you want more seasons out of it.

If you spend a lot of time building and repairing things, then drop the cash on good tools. If not, you don't need them and buying them would be a wasted investment. \n\nA good safety razor like a Merkur or a vintage Gillette with a nice shaving soap gives you a great shave, and the blades are WAY more reasonably priced than the plastic multi-blade bullshit. \n\nWatches... I like them. But- do you really need an expensive Rolex/Patek Philippe/Bulova/Elgin to tell time? A $25.00 Casio or Timex will keep time just as well. \n\nIf you wear suits regularly, getting a tailored suit is a good investment. \n\nI don't wear suits so I don't see myself ever getting a custom fitted suit.\n\n\nThat said; I recommend spending some cash on an *experience*. \n\nRent some track time in an exotic car you've always liked.

Consider paying a tiny bit extra since this is could be something you could use for the rest of your life.\n\nA bidet (cheap ones work just as well as the expensive ones for the most part).\n\nA trimmer with a set of guards, and learn to cut your own hair (YouTube it).  You'll get better with time, and plan on cutting every 1-2 weeks to look sharp.  Saves a lot of time and money.\n\nClothes that fit you well. Not too long, tight, baggy, etc.\n\nConsider getting a nice set of adjustable weights and a workout bench if you have space.  I'd probably recommend a set that goes up to 50 pounds and is adjustable in 5 pound increments. Also, don't go cheap, or plates will fall on your teeth.\n\nTry quitting video games for a while and workout during that time instead.  Going to a gym is good, but if you're motivated, you can do a lot with an adjustable weight set.\n\nA bike or two.  Having a folding bike is nice, especially if your car can carry both. Then you can go on little biking dates.\n\nA speedminton/speed badminton set is nice to have for some random fun anywhere, and most women are more than happy to try it with you (good date thing).\n\nIf you live close enough to a beach, you should probably get a nice mat and umbrella set.  Tommy Bahama makes nice ones.\n\nA good mini multitool that fits in that tiny pocket in your jeans.  You'll be surprised how often you, or the hapless people you're with, will use it.\n\nPersonally, I purchased a whole new set of matching black socks, and white socks, and threw all my old ones away.  Saves lots of time doing laundry or trying to find matching pairs.\n\nCleaning supplies - giant gallon vinegar jug, 2-3 spray bottles, baking soda in large bag, bleach spray, general disinfecting spray ... Get the right thing for the job and cleaning becomes less impossible :)\n\nSomething I like to treat myself to are smart speakers, light bulbs, and power strips.  I still need to replace the wall light switch with a smart version, because I'm usually repeating a couple of times to turn off the lights when I'm leaving :P",

I mention two because I keep one in my house and one in my vehicle with straps and jumpers etc. Other investments to make, A nice Carbon Steel or cast iron Frying pan, a high quality Chefs knife, a fire extinguisher or 2 (again vehicle+house) and an outdoors knife with a sheath. Also buy yourself something nice, it doesn’t have to become an heirloom but one of my planned purchases is a nice custom made ring with my birthstone. It could be a watch, fancy cuff links, a tailored suit, high quality dress shoes, fancy paintbrushes if you’re an artist. It could be anything of quality that adds appeal to what you do. If you work with wood splurge for the carbide bits and Italian hand crafted small batch chisels, if you’re in the kitchen like me buy a leather knife roll or a custom wood cutting board to support local artisans.

Also cover the basic essential things to own that you learn in your 20’s while having roommates, like a candle and small trash bin in the bathroom for guests, hand towels and pillow cases that match, an area rug or throw blanket for the couch, an actual bed frame and night stand for Christ’s sake.

There is a specific strain of cotton that is long stem named Egyptian cotton but this can be used as a marketing tool as technically, any cotton from Egypt is 'Egyptian cotton'. You could also get Pima cotton (genetically related to the real Egyptian cotton), which is grown in south Brazil for equal/superior quality in stem length.\n\nAlso, the weave of the cotton is just as important than the stem length. You really want Percale weave sheets ~ this is the weave used in high quality luxury hotels. Sateen is another popular weave both of which have very different textures.\n\nIf you're looking for good sheet recommendations, I would go with these.\nAlso, note that the thread count is 280. This might feel low compared to the 600+ thread count sheets you might see online, but this is actually in the ideal range for percale weave. Because the stem is longer, you don't need more threads to achieve the weave. This also allows for a cool, crisp feeling for the sheets.\n\nI use these sheets with a matching duvet cover from L.L Bean paired with my Feathered Friends 850 Fill Baffle Box goose down comforter.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk on luxury bedding.",

            "text": "I think it really depends on your personal interests for what you specifically should get, but I would say that it’s okay to spend a good chunk of money on something of supreme quality or high performance (these can be subjective). For me personally, I have had my purchases mapped out for a while now. I bought a new truck at 28: 2020 model, very nice but not over the top, awesome warranty to cover it until 100k miles. I am currently building a custom house at 29: 1,600 sq ft on 1/4 acre of land, about $25k in upgrades from the base model but the mortgage will still be less than my current rent. When the house is done at 30, I will buy a 84” OLED TV: I’m a homebody most days, so $3-5k for something that I use several hours per day makes sense to me. When my truck is paid off at 31, I will buy my dream car- a Dodge Viper: 2004-2008 model, nothing too fancy but something I’ve been obsessed with since the first time I saw a picture of one. After that, just continue to be smart with income, investments, purchases, and spending. \n\nMy point is that you should really think about what has value to you. You need a car, you need a place to live, you need food, you need entertainment. To me, there’s nothing wrong with spending a bit extra on any of those if it makes sense to you and you can legitimately afford to do so. Don’t take on $10k in credit card debt that you can’t handle just to go see a championship game, but if you can save/budget for the experience- do it. Plan for major wants/needs. Splurge on a nice meal when you know you can, but don’t do it every night. Basically, go after your goals- even the outlandish ones- with a solid and intelligent approach. \n\nI hope your early/mid 20’s were nowhere near the shit show that mine were, but growing the fuck up has had its perks.",

Soon enough though the pain begins to linger and you rub your feet a bit more, reluctant to even wear shoes when you just don't *have* to.  Eventually the pain in your heels is nearly constant, it lingers long after your shifts and sleep seems to be the only cure for the dull ache, however short lived.\n\nBut then, *I found it*.  I was minding my own business walking around Bed, Bath and Beyond when I looked into the Beyond and saw the most curious fixture.  Sitting there on the floor looking like a giant over sized boot was the most simple looking machine.  It called itself a \"foot and calf massager\" but having been duped into wasting my money before on cheap massagers that felt like you were laying on tumbling rocks I was dubious as I approached.\n\nCurious though after having discovered the joy of a *real* massage chair at my chiropractor (waste of money tbh, best part was basically paying $40 to sit in the massage chair) I was tempted to sit down and try it out.\n\nI slipped my feet and legs into this little boot, pushed the power button and within 5 seconds I had to stand up.  I immediately turned off the machine, declared that angels have created the greatest machine in a decade, and began to look for a price.  $200.  I sank a little because it was a bit steep but not totally outside the realm of cost for how *amazing* it was.\n\nYour feet and calves are enveloped in this perfect pressure that glides up the sides of your feet ***and compresses your heels(!!!)*** before the rolling motion under your feet begins.... it makes a mockery of the best foot massage a professional masseuse could offer.  The gliding comes in waves and I'm certain the experience could only be made better if you used it while watching the ocean slowly roll by (or up your yard depending where you live... yay global warming).\n\nI stewed over this machine for the next day and wound up buying it... I'd like to thank Klarna for that opportunity (and for their current promo w/BB&B - I got it for $145).  I couldn't get the machine out of my head and I know I'd forever think back to those perfect five seconds whenever my feet ached and how that machine could just whisk the pain away.\n\nI'm picking it up today and I haven't been this excited about something for years.",

Brakes, oil changes, painting a room, installing some new thing, paying delivery on furniture, etc. Don't get me wrong, there's still stuff that still makes sense to do myself, but it's just about finding that balance and if I do a DIY project it's because I'm going to find enjoyment out of it.

I'll do a Udemy course or read something).   \n\n\nIf I were to give a completely materialistic thing, it'd be a grill.

It's nice to be able to shift from having to rely on quality housing/vehicles to your tools and work space instead. You save a lot more from using older consumables like cars and gear and housing and just keeping them running longing. Women also see that as far more valuable than just buying new stuff. You can lose money and things but it's pretty hard to lose skills. Keep in shape. It's easy to get lazy for a year or two and loose good habits. Don't give up your health for anything. Set up your environment and friend group where working out is the thing you automatically do. Not drinking and eating and sitting around. You can do that a number of ways. For me, finding some sort of workout every day is as programmed into me as wiping my butt. Practice saying no to food and drinks from friends so they know boundaries and to the point where you're comfortable saying no and not feeling badly about it.\n\nEDIT:My 10 degree down sleeping quilt, hiking air mattress and backpack have also been been invaluable.

I got my Aldens (Straight-tip, Cap-toe in black calfskin) back in August, and they are *fantastic* boots that always look good.\n\nThese are great investments if you wear them even semi-regularly.  Keep them brushed and toss a pair of shoe-trees in them, condition them when needed, and you may not need any other boots for 10-15 years, maybe longer (depending on wear).  When you wear out the soles, you can have them replaced and keep on wearing them.\n\nThey're not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for.\n\nI would also suggest:  A nice, full-grain (and make sure it's full-grain) leather belt.

An expensive watch or car? A cheap watch serves the same exact purpose and a reliable car will serve you better than a top end sports car. A nice pillow/mattress, workout equipment, tools and house will all pay their dividends daily or over the course of decades. The good answers to this question will vary depending on your hobbies. Musical instruments or a home theater will often last a lifetime if you're into that. A good kitchen knife will, too, but a cheap one works if you don't cook often. If you're a TV enthusiast, you're welcome to buy the expensive one with all the new technology. But given that your a TV enthusiast, you will be wanting an upgrade soon when new technology comes out, despite the fact that your TV still deserves it's purpose perfectly well. This materistic mindset is designed to steal your money. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's why we work. But materialism has yet to proven a sustainable human endeavor, and odds are the amount of happiness you get from upgrading to the new iphone/gpu/tv every year is not worth it. And if you can't take care of shit or keep track of it, don't buy the expensive one! Invest in yourself.",

My wife and I both agree that they're the most comfortable sheets we've ever slept on. It's gotten to a point where, when it's time to change the sheets, we will do the laundry the same day specifically so that we can still sleep on the same sheets that night and don't have to put on different, non-Boll & Branch sheets.\n\n\\- Great socks / underwear. Look around, do some research, read some reviews, maybe try a few brands out and pick the ones you like. I swear by Tommy John boxers and Bombas socks. I've never looked back.\n\n\\- As many people have suggested, a good office chair either for home or work use (or both). Herman Miller is the premier brand without question, although lately I have grown very fond of the Autonomous ErgoChair which is much more affordable. Slightly lower build quality but still a great chair.\n\n\\- If you're into gaming, you can look up some videos on building your own PC and put together a solid rig for a fraction of the cost of pre-built PCs. It sounds intimidating, but isn't nearly as difficult as it sounds especially with some of the tools online that can ensure compatibility and power load. As an added bonus, your self-built PC won't come with any of the annoying bloatware that companies like HP and Dell pre-load onto your computer.\n\n\\- An Amazon Echo or Google Home unit, especially if you plan to get compatible smart devices which can be controlled by them. Smart homes are fun.\n\n\\- A nice, compact multi-tool that you can bring with you for everyday carry (EDC) in case you ever have a need for light tasks like cutting boxes open, unscrewing things, etc. I personally like the Leatherman Squirt as it's very compact and has enough tools to handle most light tasks.",

I would spend about $100 for a couple daily wear shoes (each), but go for the highest durability you can. You can definitely find cheaper though. I can’t tell you all how many people I see all the time with nice clothes and crap shoes. It makes the biggest difference, and nothing changes the entire attire like your shoes. I wear some real nice shoes all the time, even if I’m in jeans and a t-shirt, still look better than the guy in the nice suit and crap shoes. I have the same 4 pairs of shoes for the last 10 years, just take them to the cobbler once a year or so. A couple moccasins will do.\n\nThe details really make ALL the difference.\n\nThe three high quality items on your person should be your wedding band (or signet ring), your watch, and your shoes. You walk around with those in your casual clothes and you’ll still look like a boss.\n\nI like the MENE 24k wide wedding band or a Rebus signet ring (never go under 18k for yellow gold, and keep in mind 24k is quite soft).\n~ $1200\n\nJunghans watches are my preferred. Make it simple when you choose a watch. Gold chassis with white watch face and black or brown leather strap, or black watch face with a black leather strap. They should match most of your clothes.\n~ $1200\n\nFor shoes, Florsheim penny loafers are not bad. Something you can put a good shine on and relatively thicker leather. Get a cobbler to put a thick hide sole and their hardest heel. Skip the rubber on the sole and get it as an add-on later if you’re not into the feel of your step.\n~ $100 e/\n\nI recently purchased some Lucchese cowboy boots for work (my 5th pair of shoes), they’ve got the water resistant back, a vibram sole, and a shiny medium square toe. I can wear them to a business meeting or take them hiking, ran me about $300. For cowboy boots I always suggest a not too pointy tip, and not too round. Always a tapered heel.\n\nEdit: one more item, sunglasses. Skip RayBans and go with a Randolph Engineering pair, I like the model Aviator II with the sweat bar and 23k plated gold frame, it’s got the bayonet temples and tan polarized lens, or go with the green non-polarized lens. Their grey/black lenses are also fantastic, they have overall best quality sunglasses in my opinion.\n~ $300",

So you should know more about what colors, patterns you like etc. Black is classic, grey is good, dark blue can be nice. Other styles and colors can really work for some guys. I like tonal pinstripes, and pinstripes in general. But again, style is personal. If you are dropping more than $1000 on a suit it should be something you love and wear for years.
