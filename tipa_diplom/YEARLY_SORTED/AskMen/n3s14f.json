            "text": "Not exactly a thought but apparently I was always fascinated with the female anatomy. We didn't have any sex-ed and it was pretty taboo to talk about that sort of stuff here. I remember one time in kindergarten where I literally crawled under a girl wearing a skirt and stared at her crotch with intense curiosity. I knew it was an inappropriate thing but my curiosity overcame me. Oddly enough she didn't move away and instead watched me with the same curiousity. I was basically laying there trying to figure out why girls were different. This later on led to a pretty awkward conversation between me, the principal lady and my mom.\n\nI also later found out that when I was a toddler I'd go up to my moms lady friends and caress their legs and sometimes their breasts with the same curiousity. Imagine a toddler fondling an adult woman as if he was conducting some sort of a science experiment. I didn't know this untill I was 20 or so and one of my moms friends came to visit after a looong time. It was a weird conversation starter when she saw me and suddenly went \"Oh hi there. Remember you used to caress my legs and fondle me?\" especially since her daughter who was about 7 years younger than me was just sitting besides her. I had never felt so awkward before.\n\nOh and also as an infant when my mom would go out holding me in her arms I'd apparently try to reach out to other women and try to get them to hold me and I'd examine their faces, arms and of course the breasts... My mom told me I was especially fond of the blondes.\n\nFunny enough I still like to \"examine\" my girlfriend. Not even sexually. I like getting lost looking into her eyes, her lips, neck. I like  running my fingers over her arms, legs and other parts, just checking her reaction. Lucky for me she finds it weird in a cute way and not a creepy way.",

I bought four different brands and one of each size and did the same for pads.  I had the kids bathroom stocked and ready.\n\nShe comes to me with a worried look and tells me its Time.  The Time.  Go Time.  Time for me to *make things happen* so she can feel comfortable. \n\nNow I don't know jack about this situation, but I'm her Daddy and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let my girl down. \n\nI decide to first lighten the mood a bit.  So I open the cabinet in a very dramatic fashion, put on my best James Earl Jones voice and gesture to the plethora of options contained within and say, \"Choose\"\n\nShe busts out laughing.  \n\nWhen she calms down she asks me how we choose.  So I say, \"Sweetheart, I honestly have no idea.  Do you want to call your mom? I'm sure she knows.\"\n\nShe gets really quiet for a minute then looks me in the eyes and says, \"I love Mom but, I just feel more comfortable with you.  Can we do this? Is that Ok?\"\n\nI nearly broke.  I just hugged her and said, \"Of course, babygirl.  We'll figure it out.  No worries.\"  So we read every box together.  We go on the internet.  I watched god damn You Tube videos about Tampons.  (my feed is weird now)\n\nI learned about toxic shock.  Its a problem. Its overblown.  But it is a thing so don't ignore it.  But don't freak out because you're problem fine. Unless you sleep with it in.  Then its bad and can kill you. But probably won't.  Unless it does.  \n\nAlso, sizes: it needs to be enough to stop the flow.  But not too big because that's uncomfortable and can be difficult to remove.  \n\nAlso you have to wear a tampon when you swim; a pad won't do it.  But they expand with moisture so....that sucks for swimmers.  But also don't forget to take it out after you get home from practice because you're still worried about that whole toxic shock thing.  \n\nAlso young girl cycles are NOT regular.  Her body is still figuring things out.  So sometimes I buy her chocolates and snacks and they sit there.  And sometimes I make a late night run to the store so she can feel comfortable when she is uncomfortable in her own skin.\n\nAnd man the things she is dealing with.  The weird physical feelings and strange way her emotions creep up on her.  She tells me what she's feeling and what she hates about her period.\n\nI had no idea having a period was so damn exhausting. Blew my mind.",

Three of us were all in committed long-term relationships, but the one girl who wasn't ended up having a one night stand with an Italian man she met at the gym. She was pretty drunk (they happened to bump into each other at a club, we tried to convince her to come home to no avail) and definitely regretted it the day after. She got home early in the morning and told us what happened. She was on her period, and told him this while they were making out expecting that to rule out PIV intercourse, only to have him say he didn't care and pull out her tampon for her. Even though she did enjoy herself she was clearly embarrassed and felt dirty afterwards, understandably. As we're all getting ready for school, she gets a call from this poor man who is frantic. He tells her that she forgot her tampon! He found it in the trash and put it in a bag for her and offers to run over and deliver it to her. This poor man was so concerned, I don't know why he thought tampons were reusable like that but honestly it was sweet how much trouble he went to to make sure she was good. Our roommate was mortified by the whole thing, and spent the rest of our trip trying to avoid seeing him at their gym. The guy was like head-over-heels for her, but since she was leaving within a few weeks she understandably didn't want to start anything with him, especially after such an embarrassing string of interactions.",

Granted, she was incredible and talked me through what she liked and I was very aware of her needs.
