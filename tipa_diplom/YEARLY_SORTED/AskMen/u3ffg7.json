Big enough to hold tournaments for Table Top Wargaming, Rooms made for Tabletop RPG sessions, a bunch of tables for classic board gaming/trading card games. The works. I always have everything in stock like I'm the Willy Wonka of Game Stores.\n\nI'd have a great sit down restaurant on site too, maybe themed after a D&D tavern, and it by itself would have the standard finger fare (done to a much higher quality than standard expectations) required for gaming sessions but also just be a place you would come to eat even if you weren't looking for a game. And you'd be able to pick up a game from a checkout section of the store and play it while you eat/hang out with friends and family.\n\nIn addition to all of that I would try to set up some sort of place where I could have streaming/VOD's of me and my friends/employees playing board games, Magic, 40k, D&D, all of the above.\n\nI'd treat my employees better than any other game store employee has ever been treated, I'd make sure our customers were always getting the best deals, and I'd make sure the communities that partook of the hobbies I invested in were always supported well.\n\nI would run that thing as non-profitable as necessary to make a monument to Nerdom that would last until I died off and as far in perpetuity as my wealth will take it.\n\nBut I couldn't imagine a more fun way to spend my time.

That is just the best feeling ever.. \n\nSadly, there is zero money to be made here (and just as well, imho.. I think making money of of animals almost always gives perverse incentives)..

I ended up torn between the two, to be a pilot or a train driver. Then when I got a bit older I loved tv production. I'd create my own videos, stop motion, pirated after effects to create amazing shit (in my eyes). I even went to college to study TV production. But then....then life changed, and I'm now a train driver. Not only a driver, I now teach people how to drive trains and I couldn't be fucking happier. Literally wake up happy to go to work each day. \"I get to drive a train and I get to teach someone how to drive it AND I get paid for it!\". \n\nThere were a few steps in between though. When I was in college studying media, I worked in theme parks and bloody loved it. Ended up quitting college to work in theme parks full time, which in the end helped me to get job as a train driver. Looking back at every twist and turn, there is no way in hell I would've changed anything to be able to end up where I am now.

            "text": "December 2019. I see a job for a little company starting up that was a Virtual Reality Arcade. They were looking for associates and game masters as well as people who knew how PCs and VR headsets worked. The idea was, of course, people come in and pay a time allotment at one of the VR stations to try some games and introduce the general public to VR. I have been super into VR gaming for a good bit and knew the technology to where, after some interviewing, they basically guaranteed me a manager position to help keep things running and train any other people how to calibrate the headsets, set up the programs, and process orders for time before, during, and after customer sessions.\n\nJanuary 2020. We get rolling. Studio is set up, 16 Vive Pro and two extra family bays with solid rigs to run any game we had. Beat Saber, Superhot, SkyrimVR, Spiderman, and even just cruising Google maps street view. One little girl wanted to see the top of Mt. Vesuvius and look in the crater. Luckily Google has cammed the trail up to there and we were able to show her a glimpse of her dream. I can still hear her excited shrieks of excitement seeing that. Another time an older gentleman came in and actually rocked Superhot after another game master explained its a time stop puzzle. He loved stopping and figuring out what to do. Seeing his processing as he stops so suddenly to think and actually being able to do what he wanted by moving his body instead of having to ask what button does he press was amazing. It showed me how different VR could be for people if they were introduced and could access it easier. Rather than having to drop thousands of dollars just for a decent experience. It was a dream come true to share something I love with people, help progress the technology, and make a career out of it.\n\nFebruary 2020. Covid. We're forced to shut down because naturally sticking something to people's faces over and over again is not Covid compliant. We're also not an essential business, so no chance. Since then, I've been having steady work through shipping warehouses and odd jobs. But I am never going to look back at this Covid era with any kind of fondness. It has been nothing but misery financially, emotionally, mentally, and physically.\n\nSorry to vent so hard. I miss my job",

If you're unfortunately not earning enough to do so don't delude yourself into thinking working a 'dream job' will prevent you from the suffering of living pay check to pay check or barely earning enough to live. People always think they need more than they do. You'd be better off working a job you don't enjoy that earns more or gives you more free time, whatever you choose. If you don't have a choice don't delude yourself into thinking other people are out there happy at their dream jobs even if they aren't rich. People will often say they love their job to pad their own psyche from the torments they do suffer from constant work. Break your delusions through understanding human history. Why we did what we did in the past because of what we wanted then and what was the result. Man didn't leave the stepp to live in the city to work a dream job. Man left the stepp to work less and live an easier more stable life. We wanted to work less and live easier. That is the goal. Always has been. People often say if you love what you do you won't work a day in your life. I see it the other way. If you think you love your work so much that you're not working, you're likely to never believe that you should ever stop. Slave for life, acceptance of pushed back retirement ages etc..

I ended up working in production for a pretty good company, but I kept the night job as well and put my girlfriend through school.  Eventually we got married and I got promoted into sales.  \n\nMy son was born and my wife was the bread winner, so she had to go back to work...  It broke her (and me).  We decided to send me back to school to get my degree that I started 12 years earlier.  It was difficult to say the least, but I stayed at that company working part time in customer service and my daughter was born 2 weeks before finals in my junior year.  \n\nI graduated and the company offered me a position in the engineering department.  I have now been here for 28 years and the job has taken me all over the world - even moving my entire family to Germany for a while.  I sometimes dislike the people I work with, but my son just started an internship in our IT department since he is in school for that - and it is so surreal for me.  I have tried to look at other jobs, but I wouldn't have the freedom I have here - I am now doing R&D and developing new technology for the company and it keeps me on my toes.  I love it.\n\nTL:DR - I pretty much have my dream job.  I can't think of anywhere else I would be happier - and that is pretty huge for me!",

Setting up partnerships with vets, schools, and prisons to help students and former inmates get jobs and experience to be able to find work when they are ready while providing a valuable service to the community (and getting paid fair wages of course).\n\nLastly, I’d love to be an athlete.

Obviously, the movie theater industry is in shambles right now but if I were super rich, I'd take a note out of Paul Allen's book and have my own theater to show movies when I want to see them and sometimes special screenings to show classics and fill it with movie memorabilia.\n\nFor people that don't know what I'm talking about, look up Seattle Cinerama.  It's unfortunately closed now due to COVID but it was a thing of beauty when it was opened and I luckily got to see a few movies there with friends; Blade Runner 2049 being one of them.",

Fit as all get out, basketball full time, got my Associates degree doing college classes at night and over the summer. 32 on the ACT. Apply for Air Force academy, nominated by my congressman, go with basketball team to elite eight and killing my senior year as far as grades go senior spring, backup schools were all major universities with a few full ride offers for STEM stuff, acceptance letter never comes. My LO called and was told I grew (height) out of my targeted weight range and my BMI fell too low. I grew like 4 inches over late junior and senior year. Hard to keep the BMI up growing like that. \n\nI wish people understood how I felt the next year. Lost friends, tried to go to school in the fall and just had no motivation. Came home winter break and parents just didn’t get it. \nIn their mind I had made the 99 percent and lost out on the 1 percent. Tried AFROTC, just didn’t click and I was miserable. Saw guys give bare minimum effort in bare minimum degree paths and pick up pilot slots on political points via reference letters from in house officers. \n\nIt clicked. It was never about the job. It was about giving everything, feeling like I deserved it, and losing it to something I couldn’t control. \n\nFast forward: Started a company, back in school at my local school at night, paid every dollar out of my own pocket, just graduated, built my own plane last year, and I found an absolutely insane passion for law so I’m going to law school in the fall. \n\nIm venting at this point: but please do not let your work ethic and capability to achieve what you THINK you want override trying to discover your true passion and finding something that doesn’t feel like work.",

There are variations, but my role for the last 7 years has been at cybersecurity startups. Just a few of the perks:\n\n-\tI make $180,000 base salary, OTE (total compensation if I hit my sales quota) is $240,000.  This varies from year to year but on average it’s pretty reasonable to hit quota in a given year.\n-\t100% work from home, even pre covid. Depending on the company some minor travel may be required but not usually. For reference I’ve maybe travelled twice in the past 3 or so years. All the travel is paid for by the company, so you get free miles/hotel points to apply them to your actual vacations. This means if your role has higher travel, you usually accrue enough miles and hotel points to vacation 100% free.\n-\tStartups usually give equity. This is hit or miss, but I made about $300,000 cash when my last startup got bought out. I’ve also been let go when a startup failed, but still got a generous severance package so your startup going belly up isn’t the end of the world.\n-\tunlimited PTO. Usually standard in the industry.\n-\tNo set work hours. Aside from customer calls/meetings. Nobody cares when you work and there is nobody monitoring you when you are not actively on a call. If you get your shit done, you can work 5 hours a week or 40 hours a week, it’s entirely up to you. I’d say for the past 7 years I average about 12-18 hours of work per week.\n-\tInternet/Phone can be 100% expenses to your company.\n-\tWork/life balance is amazing. I usually wake up around 8-9, and have time to walk my dog 2-3 times a day before I wrap up work around 3pm. I probably do actual work on average 3-4 hours a day, plenty of time to cook and do house chores, go to the gym, run errands, etc.\n-\thighly specialized skill set, so you will always be in demand. The role requires technical expertise but also strong communication skills as you frequently have to explain technical concepts to non-technical people. Usually the best engineers are total fucking weirdos who cannot talk to a CISO/CIO/VP of a Business unit. I am constantly getting hit up for jobs.\n\nEvery time this question gets asked, I try to spread the word that being a Sales Engineer is the best job in the world. Any questions feel free to ask.",

I'm more fortunate than most though! In my younger years and better bands I played to hundreds of people and even thousands on a couple of occasions including some festivals and supporting slots at large venues but we could never quite break through and many many years later? I play in a \"dad rock cover band\" but we get regular gigs, never play for free, have a decent following (as far as pub cover bands go) and it works as a nice little bonus and release from my REAL job... but man what I would give to have one more go at it and try to take on the world!

            "text": "When I was a child my mother and I were all we had. Her boyfriend at the time would beat us both, and sexually molested me for years. One day he was beating her, I was in the corner crying, and literally a police officer was driving through the neighborhood, and saw what was happening, him beating my mother as usual, the house looked like a war zone. My moms boyfriend was already a convicted felony. This police officer rushed in. He saved my mom, and I. Luckily the criminal justice system worked. He went to jail for years, and I never saw him again. I’ll remember his name forever. The police officer checked on us regularly, would bring me baseball cards, and was all around my hero. I became obsessed with the police, would dress as one for Career Day, rode my bike around the neighborhood with a cape, and tried to help others. I would end up interning my senior year at high school at my local PD, and the more involved I became the more I loved it. I eventually got a part time summer job helping dispatch, answering the phones, and people who would come in. Eventually they sponsored me for the reserve police academy, and I became a year round reserve officer. I worked my ass off, and did everything they asked me, for very little money, but I didn’t care. They offered me a full time emergency telecommunications officer position, and I took it. Anything and everything they asked me to do I did to my best ability. I made mistakes, but always wanted to learn. I was so proud to wear the uniform. Then I had an interview, and went through the hiring process to become an full time patrol officer. I was chosen, and hired. I went to the police academy for 30 weeks, and it was extremely hard. People quit, didn’t pass the PT tests, or regular standard testing, etc. It was the hardest thing I did. Graduation day came, and I couldn’t have been prouder. My greatest achievement. My mom pinned my badge. I was 21, and was in for a roller coaster, but I stood firm,  in helping others. I wanted to be my hero. I worked for ten years, and saw a lot of awful things, and bad people. I cried when I’d come home sometimes, and U started to drink after I was the first responder to a child that was run over by a skid steer. I’ll never forget it. I had nightmares, drank heavily, etc. One night I put my gun to my head. I couldn’t take it. The job had destroyed me. My anxiety, and PTSD were too much. I stopped. I have two kids, and a wife. I spent a month at a program that helps first responders like me. I came out sober, and with the mental tools to continue my career as I always wanted to do. Then at 32 in January 2021 I had back surgery, again in October, and a major fusion in December 2021. I was finished. My career was over. My dream had ended. Not only that but I was/am suffering incredible pain every day, and was diagnosed a month ago with Arachnoiditis, a painful nerve discover that will slowly consume my body. I refused to let everything against me stop me, including my former employer/town municipality refusing to accept my claim for disability. I started law school recently, and I hope with my training, and experience as a police officer, that I can find a way to still help others. \n\nI wouldn’t change a thing. I worked hard, achieved my dream, and had a hell of a career, good, and bad. I hope I can pass the bar, and help victims, like my mother, and I, but in a new way. My body may be failing, but my mind is still good. As long as it’s possible I’ll continue to dedicate my life to helping others. \n\nI know Reddit is critical of the police, and I under why. The injustices, and abuse of power by police nationwide in the US, disgust me, but please believe me that there are “good guys”. One saved my life.",

I never filled it out because I was so wrapped up in my social life at the time. Once I got to college I was partying constantly and kinda coasting along on decent grades. I loved improv and SNL so much and it’s the biggest regret of my life that I didn’t fill out the application and at least try.

I've found the aspect of weather interesting since I was a kid and it was one of the things that kept me awake at night wondering how different things worked. Another aspect I love about weather is tornado chasing and I've always wanted to get up close to one but not too close of course, that wouldn't be a happy ending \nEven now at 20 year old I'm hoping to go to a college with a meteorology program but right outside my bedroom window I have a personal at home weather station that I bought just to remind me that despite the pandemic and things being difficult my dream is only a few raindrops away.",

Nova eventually finds out that he stole a small spacecraft to escape his home planet, since he worked as a servant for the king and was horribly mistreated by him.\n\nAfter a few months, a bunch of small, nearly-invisible orbs start appearing around Nova’s apartment. It turns out that they’re spy drones with imbedded cloaking devices, and they’re looking for Kona because he has the soul of Earth’s moon inside him. He is the only person on his home planet who can both heal and create shields, and he was used to protect the planet’s armies in their conquests of the other rabbit tribes.\n\nI have this entire story planned out in my head, and I think about it constantly. I just picture this deep, respectful relationship that blossoms between Kona and Nova as Nova learns more, and as they begin to share more with one another. If the player makes certain choices, they will fall in love and unlock a hidden ending portion of the game including an extra boss fight where they work together to defeat the king.\n\nI wrote Nova to take after my wife, who I feel saved me in a similar way. I want the game to be fun and fluid, yet challenging both emotionally and gameplay-wise. I even have side characters written.\n\nI went to coding school and graduated recently, but I only know JavaScript and some frameworks like React and Next. I want to learn languages to create this game, but it will take a lot of time on my own.\n\nSorry, I’m a bit drunk. I just can’t forget my dream and I need to share it.",

Anything under that and you can’t reach pedals and controls and the seat doesn’t fit right.

This couldn’t be just a one way street for me. I would have to Figure out how to use my life skills to help somehow. Feel like I am contributing.",

Decided to give teaching a try as an interim period and turned out I absolutely love it. Now I'm a teacher for life. I actually have my dream job. Is every day perfect? Not in the slightest. But I genuinely love my job. All that cringe shit they say about how fulfilling it is to educate young people and help them realise their goals is 100% real, it is sort of magical and makes me emotional just thinking about it. It's wonderful, I think the dynamic of teacher and student is sort of sacred in a way. One of the things I will be proud of on my deathbed is knowing I helped people in my work.\n\nWhen I was 16 I had a history teacher who was this huge black German guy, and I looked up to him so much because he was so smart and entertaining when teaching history (and I had father issues so I would innately be attracted to men who I looked up to - not in a sexual way, but just trying to replace my father). He inspired me to do better (no small feat since I was an incredibly lazy kid) and I used to approach him after class to ask him questions about history and politics and he always had time for me during his lunch break. My dream is that I can be that guy for other young people now that I'm the adult. Sometimes I'll be on break and a student approaches me and I'm thinking \"fuck bro, I just wanna eat my lunch in peace\" but then I always think of my history teacher, then put aside my lunch and give that student all my attention. That man changed my life to be honest, it's my dream I can be that guy for other people.",

It gets more competitive each year, where not even a 99th percentile and a 3.9 isn't enough to get into even the lowest schools. I feel like someone who actually cares would realize it's so hard that they could spend time better helping people other ways. Once I was 3/4ths the way through I finally realized how hard it was gonna be during my application year so I just followed through. Could be the sunken cost fallacy but it was my best option each year, but each year it got more competitive. It's scary not knowing how amazing you'll have to be by time you go to apply. The way you prepare makes it so you can't make a lot of money and have to invest hundreds of hours in non-marketsble skills and experiences.

The company I work for isn’t the best as far as quality/competent workers but over 7 years of my career I have worked my ass off for them to get many projects that have fallen behind back on track. They really depend on me since I have been loyal to them, proved my knowledge of the trade, and show up on time and ready to work every day. With that I have been able to take time off whenever I want and if I get a job offer I’m able to take time off and get paid way more than my regular job. Im also currently on a month long vacation that’s mostly covered through accrued PTO. When I get back to the states I’m applying to a seasonal gig in Alaska where I would be flown in on puddle jumpers and service remote weather stations for 4-5 months this summer. When I get back in the fall I will get my current job back no questions asked. Being an apprentice blows but it’s worth it for the freedom once you’re licensed",

It is more in reach than you think. You may even get a number of people, even in the Air Force, saying you can’t for XYorZ. A lot of the neigh sayers aren’t pilots.

I highly recommend you research your nearest flying guard unit, and just cold call them. Keep asking to be referred until you are speaking to a pilot and ask for the process to get yourself to UPT (undergraduate pilot training) there’s lots of ways to get there. \n\nA guy in my training class was 45 years old with 7 waivers and now he flys tankers ten miles away from where he grew up. it’s possible!\n\nDon’t let anyone tell you no, it’s absolutely possible.",
