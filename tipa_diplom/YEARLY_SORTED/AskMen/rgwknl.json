The sales guy came to my office and offered everyone a year membership for something crazy like $59, I forgot how much exactly but it was totally worth it. It seemed like it catered to the professional business crowd as the location was in the middle of mostly office buildings and industrial. \nAlso since it was 24 hour, I could fit it into my schedule as I was working full time and taking night classes. So I used to go around midnight and sometimes even later. \n\nThat is where I first noticed dudes doing that, I brushed it off as just weird but tried to ignore it. One day I went to the gym just to go to the steam room as I had a sinus thing going on and thought man it would be great. So I go to the locker room change into shorts and flip flops and head to the steam room the whole steam room was empty and this middle aged dude comes in totally naked and sits right next to me I scoot over and he starts making small talk I am just talking with my head pointed up to the ceiling and at some point I think I grabbed my towel to wipe my face and I noticed him playing with himself. \nI jumped up and got the heck out of there I went to the pool that they had in the mens side of the locker rooms area. About a minute later he plops himself in the water and starts to swim over towards me I jump up and go get dressed and left the gym. \n\nA few months later, a similar thing happened to myself and two other coworkers, we were in the locker room and one of our guys went to the shower and he said some dude just walked into his shower stall naked. \n\n\nWhen we moved out of the area I didn't renew my membership and some time later I had heard a thing about that place that it was a casual hook up spot for guys on the down low.",

Growing up I never got to see some random 40 year old people naked, I never saw other girls naked when I was a teenager, only these media folks, and literally all of my friends and me had eating disorders and bad body image.\n\nOn top of that, the nudity that we do see is usually so sexualised - especially for women, you can never ever see a woman just chilling naked without that male gaze bullshit. It's always a sexy pose, always so aware of her body's looks and trying to seduce. This is really fucked up to grow up with this framing of nakedness, for all genders.\n\nImagine - a society where being naked is just ok. Not everywhere (like you wouldn't wear a swimsuit everywhere) but there are some public spaces where is completely normal to be naked. You could go to the beach and see every body type, every age, every skin color, every amount of hair and so on... In this society nudity would not be an invitation for sex, like a swimsuit isn't, It would be just a normal part of human life like it should be. \n\nRight now the only people that are bringing us closer to this are old people at the gym (and people  from Europe where this is the norm) so give them respect.",

I've been to a few nude beaches and felt perfectly comfortable however, do you think this is due to what is conventionally accepted at a site with nudity intended, or that we're progressively becoming more prudish.

One clearly has greater gravity and purpose to it, but is there a reason I should plutonically see another man's penis and be upset by it? I think that's more indicative of personal problems to be dealt with than something that's wrong with people from a time when different aspects of their environment defined anxiety and pressure like real world problems.",

This is something I've actually tried to do more frequently, as I didn't actually do this in high school or growing up, as I was always neurotically covering up with a towel. It isn't primarily sexual or exhibitionist, at least as far as I'm aware. Our society has a weird relationship with nudity and nature, especially in the US. In school and outside it always seems like we are ashamed of our naked selves. The locker room provides an opportunity to take a measured and (more or less) victimless risk to become more comfortable putting yourself out there. I've tried to get in the habit of walking from the shower to the physical locker naked and be more comfortable with facing those ingrained feelings of shame and paranoia at someone seeing a naked me. If I have to see a few old man dicks thats a small price to pay for a healthier relationship with the human body. After all, I'm not in the gym for a sanitized experience, for smoothies, steamed towels and machines that abstract away the adaptive element of physical exertion. I'm there to put in hard work, often uncomfortable, and deal with the human condition heads on.  \n\nPart of this is facilitated by the fact that I am conventionally attractive, in great shape and don't have any anatomical hangups. Thats not to say I do it to boast or show off, peacocking around the locker room, but just to say that if I did have these hangups, there might be an additional insecurity.

Grew up with PE classes where gang showers were standard.  Nudists, comfortable with being naked.   These are the guys that drop their towels, take their time drying off, getting dressed, etc. Walking from a shower to their locker naked. \n\n2) From my perspective of a gay man:  A lot of old \"queens\".  Both \"out\" old guys and \"closeted old guys\".     These are the men that hang around way too long.  They may go into the sauna, back to the shower, walk up and down the aisles between locker and back to the sauna for 4 or 5 minutes. -- esp if another guy goes in.  The are in the locker room more than in the gym working out. (Some are never working out, not even walking on a track or a treadmill --- just in the locker room.)\n\nBasically, one group of  hetero men legitimately in the locker room that don't care what any one thinks.  One, probably smaller group of men that are definitely gay whether out or closeted. (mostly closeted)",

I have always been obese and as a kid it really limited me as I wouldn't go to the pool or the beach and would do everything I could to avoid situations where I would have to be naked in front of my peers. And I'm french, so from a nation where we have more nudist beaches than normal beaches as a kid felt a lot of shame.\n\nAnyways when I started my weight loss 10 years or so ago I decided that shame was unhealthy, it only hurted me and that weight loss or not I needed to be over with body shame.\n\nSo I went on a trip and spent as much of my vacation naked as I could. Then I started taking my shower naked with everyone at the gym. Then I gradually stopped wearing my dirty underwear to the shower getting naked at my locker instead. And I purposefully didn't wrap a towel around to fight my body shame and because at 420lbs the towel doesn't wrap around anyway.\n\nSo 10 years later I learned not to give a shit, I learned to love myself in my imperfections and fuck everyone that say I should be ashamed of myself.\n\nI mean should someone ugly, fat, disfigured, little dicked or in any way imperfect be ashamed of themselves ? We are the only animal that hurt themselves with shame based on their looks to my knowledge. It's unhealthy and I refuse to do it to myself.\n\nSo I am gonna walk around naked and show my little dick to everyone proud of myself like a peafowl because it's psychologically healthy.\n\nBonus: Walking around the locker room naked with only an N95 mask is hilarious.",
