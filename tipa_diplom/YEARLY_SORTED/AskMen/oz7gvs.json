    "What has made you realize you were getting old?\nI (25M) recently took my little sister (14) out shopping to get ready for back to school. She wanted to go to Hollister for some jeans and said ok, haven't been there in a while, let's go.\n\nGOD DAMN DID IT MAKE ME FEEL OLD.\n\nEverywhere I looked there were middle schoolers/early high school kids buying stuff that for me seemed not so long ago since I also bought. There were pictures of teenages that my sister had to point out were popular tiktokers. I KNEW NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. \n\nThere was music playing that I had never heard and the people that looked my age were the store managers and truth be told they looked funny wearing the store's clothes.\n\nI knew my tastes had changed since I was their age, but to see it so blatantly in front of me is gave me an existential crisis.": [

You get a mix of college age adults and some high schoolers who are either just entering college or taking classes at the university.\n\nI went in one day around age 30 and realized that at some point I'd lost the ability to tell apart the high-schoolers and the college students. They all 'looked' the same on reflex and it was only with Holmsian scrutiny that I was able to start picking out individuals based on the textbooks they carried with them to say if they were HS or university students. The differences I saw between myself and the customers was greater than the differences I saw between the groups I knew comprised the customers. That was a real, 'Oh dear, I'm getting old...' moment.\n\nWriting that out, though, I remembered one from a few years prior. I had been invited to a house party by an old high school friend I was reconnecting with. At the party I was drinking and dancing and having fun. Met a cute girl. We started flirting back and forth. We started sharing social media. She asked for my SnapChat. Her username was SuperGenius and a string of numbers. I said, \"Oh, like Wile E. Coyote.\"\n\n\"Who?\" \"Wile E. Coyote. Super Genius. From Roadrunner cartoons? Looney tunes? Bugs Bunny?\" Oh. She knew who Bugs Bunny was. She knew Bugs, Daffy, Fudd, Tweety and Sylvester. Foghorn Leghorn, Marvin the Martian, Yosemite Sam, Hazel, Speedy Gonzales, Rocky & Mugsy... all were foreign to her. I sighed and finally asked how old she was. Sufficed to say she was too young for me, bro. And I felt old.",

Fuck lol.  \n\n\nThen they started asking me questions about older episodes of Spongebob Squarepants, & why they look like \"older drawing style\". I actually had to bite my tongue from lashing out the ole' \"The old episodes are better\" rhetoric lol.  \n\n\nI told my siblings (who are about my age & older) that I'm officially becoming the old guy who children gather around to listen to the Before Times.",

I pull muscles, I develop minor aches and pains that can turn into major aches and pains if I don't address them.\n\nThat doesn't mean I'm old, and it doesn't mean I have to stop doing the things that I enjoy or that keep me fit as I age. It means I have to change my mentality and be smarter about the things I subject my body to. It means I have to work with a strength and conditioning coach to improve my body, I have to see a physiotherapist occasionally to work out any problems as they arise, I have to dial it back a bit when I'm training, and I have to pick and choose what I subject myself to. If my body needs a day off, it gets a day off.",

            "text": "When I started getting affected by little things. \n\nMy whole life I never needed to worry about food in the fridge, a place to live, hot water, a bed, people who love me...\n\nI remember volunteering with the homeless, my first night. It was December 2017  in Toronto. -35c with the windchill. There was a kid, couldn‚Äôt have been more than 19, with a hoodie and pants, asking for a jacket and boots (we drove around downtown handing out coffee and food and clothes and toiletries). His parents had kicked him out. We did this all night. Meth addicts, opioid users, mental health sufferers, and people who‚Äôd just had shitty fucking luck. \n\nThe shelters had no doors and people slept on cots on floors and the lights were on all the time. Bright industrial lights. \n\nIt was the coldest I‚Äôve ever been. They say dress for the weather, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much you wear after six hours out there you can‚Äôt deal. One of our clients found a warm subway grate and we had to move him off it - subway grates throw out brake dust which is horrific for the lungs, and while they are warm, the water will soak through sleeping bags and freeze. \n\nI volunteered one night on New Year‚Äôs Eve - I‚Äôd rather get good karma than spend stupid amounts of money on a club. It was 5C and raining. I had multiple layers on - hoodie sweatshirt heavy jacket gloves long John‚Äôs track pants heavy pants, fuckin everything.\n\nGentlemen, after four hours I can tell you with no hesitation that was the coldest I‚Äôd ever been in my 39 years on this planet. An unforgiving bone deep savage chill that erased even the memory of warmth from my mind.\n\nI vividly remember handing out coffees and one man turning it down repeatedly. We use coffee as a way to start conversations, let them feel heard, but this guy would not, he absolutely refused. \n\nUsing the same Meth pipehad given him several open sores in the mouth, and his teeth were abscessing. I will to my dying day never forget his words\n\n‚ÄúNever do this. If I find out you‚Äôre doing meth I will shank you with your own fucking pipe as an act of mercy.‚Äù\n\nGentlemen after that night I went home and cried. Cried for my own fucking ignorance. I went home and had a 45 minute shower just to drive out the cold. \n\nI stayed up until 2 a.m. touching everything in my apartment in utter disbelief . The giant tv I now realized was absolutely pointless and arrogant. My full fridge, the locking door to my apartment, my showe, my warm bed. My dog. My car. \n\nI may have bipolar and have gone through a lot myself. I didn‚Äôt grow up until I saw how superficial my own unhappiness was and how my only way out of it was gratitude. \n\nAll of it could be gone tomorrow. Every single last thing holding me here, gone. In a heartbeat. \n\nI‚Äôve grown up a lot in the last six-ish years. I don‚Äôt know yet that I‚Äôm old, but I‚Äôm going to be honest, I‚Äôm thankful for every day I can get up. Thankful that there are people who i can say  ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to. \n\nThat‚Äôs age for me. Learning how quickly and easily life can turn, and being grateful that it hasn‚Äôt.",

No, it's about our country's obsession with either ridiculing age or dreading aging.  For christ's sake, the OP is TWENTY-FUCKING-FIVE YEARS OLD and he's having an existential crisis over his age!?!  Being around high school kids made him feel \"old\"?  Really?  I would have thought he might feel lucky, or blessed, or fortunate that he wasn't still stuck in the glee club.  Hearing music that he'd never heard before accentuated the great divide from where he once was and where he currently is.  And, in my view, every single element of the OP's posting is a reason to CELEBRATE, not lament!  Thank the gods that you aren't still in high school, popping pimples, unsure of who you are, insecure about asking him/her out!  Thank the gods that you survived all of that and have moved on!  I am a man in my early 60s.  That fact alone is, apparently, enough to cue the laugh track.  And I work around kids who are in their 20s and 30s.  Without fail, like clockwork, when any one of them has a birthday they must, MUST always make a comment about how old they are getting.  Always, always, always.  Naturally, this brings the obligatory crowd response of reassurance that no, you're not old, blah, blah, blah...  and the entire cycle repeats itself when the next one has a birthday.  Ah yes, the great cycle of life.   Remember the AA mantra of accepting the things that you cannot change?  Of course not, you're too young.  It's called the serenity prayer.  Google it.  \"And the wisdom to know the difference.\"  Call me crazy, but my life is so much better now than when I was in my 20s.  I'm having better sex, better relationships, better food, better travels, stronger friendships.  Wallow in the \"I'm getting so old\" mud if you want, but I'm not going with you.  I have accepted the forward movement of time.",

That would be like an American not knowing about 9/11. Then I realized he wasn't even born when that happened.\n\nI'm also really amazed when I see history being rewritten in front of my eyes.

At 25 I finally bought a street legal 250 after blowing up a car engine and saying F\\*\\*\\* THIS S\\*\\*\\* I am buying a bike! (Repair bill was just around 6K.) Fell off that bike when that engine blew in 2014 (honestly a used 1998 CB 250 isn't exactly an expensive bike but the chain I spent 1K for. That mother f\\*\\*\\*ing chain NEVER broke on me. Not once.\n\nFast forward to two months later in 2014 and I take my first real spill. I low sided a used 2006 Honda Shadow 600. Knowing the bike was totaled didn't really phase me since I had gap insurance. Two years vehicle-less left me walking to and from work. I still had energy. I could still hang around. I could still think about going to college. naw. It wasn't until I got my first real bike in 2019, my softail slim, and started feeling tired... dizzy... weaker... and then my sciatica caught up and that is when the depression pretty much FLOORED me. Only in my thirties and I don't see doctors anymore. Why bother seeing a doctor when I have access to the same books, the same tools, the same OTC drugs, and sometimes even friends who have gone through the same \\*\\*\\*\\* as I for special medications that I can just bum from. Even edit the dosage by cutting the pills in half because I don't want to \"get addicted\" is when it finally just slapped me in the face.\n\nI'm old now and I stopped complaining. I'd say I toughened up harder than most others because I just did what George Carlin said when he was still with us: \"Stop caring. Even if it is just a little bit.\" I stopped caring about blasting my music for everyone to hear, now I like making them guess what I am banging my head to in my helmet. I stopped trying to make a statement with stickers. I stopped giving a damn about what others saw me as because the bottom line is this: No one lives for ever, and the ones who do? they are the real prisoners.\n\nI still ride.
