I wish it was that easy. There are black sheep everywhere and sometimes you get bad luck after bad luck. This is just a tendencie. \nAlso next time this happends to you, is it possible to ask for another officer to file your complaint?",

House, car, wife, daughter, money and sanity all gone in the blink of an eye. \n\n\nWe went out one night and drank a bit too much. Once we got home we got into a verbal fight which turned physical. She hit me, I hit her back and we went back and forth. Pretty much and lot of shoving and slapping. After we stopped she went to the bedroom and I went to another room to cool down. The next thing I know police are at my door. Apparently she called her sister to talk about the fight we had and her sister called the police. Someone not involved called the police which blows my mind. So why the fuck cant we charge Will Smith with assault? Blows my mind. Anyway I went to the door and answered it not knowing it was the police. I will admit I was a bit mouthy with them; a few fuck you's and such. I asked them to leave and they grabbed me and threw me on my front lawn and lets just say they were not gentle at all. Later on I read the police report and it said \"I  was balling my fists\" and the police were threatened. That was such bullshit. Balling my fucking fists....WTF. The thing is why was I the only one arrested? She hit me too. I told the police she hit me but still I was the only one arrested. Why was she not arrested for hitting me? Because she was a woman and because she called the police first. Women and men are treated totally different in domestic violence cases. If you call the police when a woman hits you most likely you are going to be laughed at. Its really fucking sick! This is one reason why I hate cops with a passion. Lawyers and cops...some of the worst people on the planet.\n\n\nThis incident caused a downward spiral in my life that lasted for years. When I was in jail she cleaned out the bank account. Took about $15K. It was mostly my money. She took the only money I had to defend myself over this and what's fucked up is that its totally legal. Days after my arrest she filed a restraining order. I was then kicked out of the house I paid for for the next 6 months. When I finally was able to return to my house (around 6mo later) I entered the house to find that she took pretty much everything. Furniture, kitchen things, TV's....almost everything gone. The only things she left were my computers, tools and our bed. I have a home based business so not being able to access my inventory and tools caused my business to go to be destroyed. I was also not allowed to see my 6mo baby for a year and a half. It caused me to get so depressed that I got suicidal. I attempted to kill myself but failed. I got into a car accident one night. After I woke up I could not find my phone to call for help so I walked to a nearby business. They called the police on me. When they came I begged the cop to kill me. Luckily they took me to the psych ward instead of jail. Over about the next 4 years I just got worse and worse. My ex that started all this had 3 lawyers in the immediate family so lets just say the law was not on my side through all this. She was able to keep my child from me for years. I had to have supervised visits that cost $50/hr. Countless classes and legal fees all added up. For months I had to pay to see my own fucking child because the court wanted supervised visits. No one in my family would get to see my child also. When my parents would ask my ex to see her she always made an excuse to avoid them seeing her. To this day I am still in court fighting to get more time with my daughter. Its been about 5 years since this all went down. I have only really started to get to see my daughter in the past 6mo. After the incedent my wife ended up filing for divorce. No counseling, no speaking because of the restraining order....she was gone. I struggled for years because there was no closure in our relationship. So just know this...when that girl on Tinder just goes poof, don't call that ghosting. My ex set a new standard for the word ghosting. A day before the statue of limitations was up she sued me in civil court for $300K over emotional damages. I didn't have shit...I was borrowing money for legal fees and living expenses. I had to deal with that for over a year. Luckily my lawyer was able to get the entire thing thrown out. Part of me thinks that was just her plan. To fuck with my head and to tie me up in court so I couldn't see my daughter or talk to her. She was able to get alimony for months. I ended up having to give her around $30k when we divorced. If I remember right the alimony came to around $10k. My health got pretty bad over all this. I wasn't eating right or sleeping well. I was so depressed it started to effect my body. I developed kidney stones...ended up having them twice. Worst pain I have ever felt. There is soooo much more shit things that happened over this but this post is already getting too long.\n\n\nAnyway...my point is men and women are treated totally differently in some cases. When a pretty blonde cries the whole world stops. When a man is hurt no one cares. One thing I have learned from all my trouble is that if something like this ever goes down you better call the police first! If they laugh at you shrug it off and still file charges. I never thought in a million years the woman that I loved would do all this. Sometimes the ones closest to you fuck you the worst.",

On the bus ride home she said “I’m going to rape you”.\n\nI got home, told my mom, and we called the cops to report it. An officer showed up at 3am and said “I can make a report on the verbal threat, but not on the physical assaults cause it’s like two guys slapping each other on the butt in the locker room”. He didn’t consider me telling her several times to stop, a sign that I really hated her touching me.\n\n\nLong story short, tons of cops suck in situations like this. It seems like the biggest hassle for them to deal with, but it’s an even worse experience for the victim.\n\nWhen my mom was stalked by her ex husband, she got a restraining order. She would get footage of him at the street corner of our house. When we called the cops, they said “to verify it, we would have to physically measure the distance from the house to the corner, and we don’t want to do that”\n\nCops suck and won’t take precautions tills someone’s dead.\n\n\nI’m so sorry this has happened to you. Keep trying cause occasionally you will meet a cop that will actually try to help you.

If women are seen as week and defenseless, then men who are being threatened by them are “not really in danger” because it’s just a weak woman. Thankfully, in more recent times, threats by women onto men are often taken seriously, but also a lot of times they are not. It’s seemingly the luck of the draw on whether you find someone who believes women can be dangerous or not. We really need to kill this idea that women are incapable of harm and only men are dangerous.

            "text": "Firstly,  I'm old, can someone explain  Airtag?   Nevermind I'll Google it after this. Just keep in mind I'm writing this not knowing what Airtag is.....\n\nFor context, I'm 6 foot 5, about 260lbs, and was a boxer from the age of 9 to 22. Looking at my face it's pretty obvious. \n\nMy ex wife was/is incredibly abusive. Verbally, mentally, emotionally, she's very controlling. I remember reading this 29 traits of an abusive sociopath. And it stated if someone exhibits like 15 of the traits they're considered a sociopath.  She had 27.  And I'm not saying there were 27 items where I looked and thought \"oh she did that once\".  No I mean regularly did these things.\n\nControlled the money, would get furious if I was invited to a friend's house, used sex as a weapon, used the children to exploit or extort money or get her way, checked the odometer on my car. Would drive by my work if I was working late or on weekends to make sure I was there. The list goes on and on.  \n\nAfter about 5 years together, once I was certain my daughter was old enough to know who I was, and I could get something from the courts allowing me to visit with my children I left.  I remember clearly telling my ex wife that I had to leave or I was goung to kill her, or myself but one of us was going to die if I stayed.\n\nI literally left with my truck, my tools, my clothes and $100. I contacted a friend who owned multiple rental properties and thankfully he had a spare 1 bedroom apartment that he let me move into with no money (I was able to pay off first and last over the next few months). \n\nThat was when the horror really started, hundreds literally HUNDREDS of text messages a day, EVERY DAY.  All hours. Phone calls, accusations of cheating while we were together, cheating after we separated (whatever the fuck that means). Refusing to let me see or speak to my children. Non stop harassment,  stalking. \n\nI hired a lawyer, with a loan my mother gave me (my ex at the time had extorted me into giving her $3,200/month for support). The lawyer said record EVERYTHING!  Get another phone and video Everything, every time you call the kids, every time she text, every pick up, drop off, every time she calls. Film every single interaction. \n\nI live in Ontario,  and so long as 1 person  (me in this case) is aware the interaction is being recorded then it is allowed in court.\n\nI had to install an app on my phone that time coded and backed up all her text messages to my email. I also had to open a new email account because she had access to my old one, I laid a trap, saved copies of the text messages in folder in my old email account, she went in and deleted them.\n\nSo this all culminated one weekend when my kids were with me and she was texting and calling non stop. I'd had enough and told her \"in turning my phone off\".   She blew a fucking gasket! 20 minutes later she was pounding on my door. I went to the door and asked\n \"What do you want\"  \nshe said without my phone on she had no way of knowing the children were safe (manipulation to get her way, phone stays on she can harass, phone goes off she's worried about the kids). \n\nI told her to back up and I'd open the door, she did. I opened the door but locked the storm door, and said\n\n \"Kids are right there\" \n they were sitting on the couch, eating snacks watching cartoons. She tried to rip the door open, I closed the main door and locked the dead bolt. She broke the screen door (not hard). And kicked at the main door multiple times, eventually splintering the door frame. Quite literally kicked my door open and tried to force her way in.\n\nDuring all this the the old lady across the street phoned the police. Cops show up as she's trying to force her way in.\n\nShe's screaming at me, at the police. Cops talk to her. Then come to me, 1 male, 1 female. They say\n \"She's concerned about the kids\" \nI say \"Kids were fine, they're upset now. But that's because she came here and smashed my door open\"\n\n I told them about the calls and text, female cop says \n\"maybe you should just let her take them home\"\n I say \"These are court order visits, I literally had to fight in court, it cost me $73,000 just to be able to see them. Then she throws a fit and you're telling me to give them back early?  No fucking way\".\n\nI said to the male cop\n \"if the roles were reversed and i went to ger house abd kicked the door open I'd be in handcuffs right now.  You guys are tell me to ignore our court order to keep her happy? No way!\"\n\nHe started getting super aggressive with me. Like raising his voice yelling at me saying \"you're goung to tell me how to do my job!?!\"\n\nWhen I looked at the female cop I said \"Are you guys for real?\" And she Said... I remember this clear as day \n\"Big tough guy like you, you can't control your wife?\".\n\nIt was then I pointed at the camcorder in the corner of the front hallway filming everything and Said \"so you're both aware, this entire situation has been recorded\"  and both thier faces dropped.\n\nI asked them again \n\"So to be clear, she can stalk, harass, invade my home and assault me, and your suggestion is to either A) Give my kids back early and go against the court order, or B) man up and deal with her myself?  Ok. Fine, you can tell her, the kids will go back to her house Sunday evening as scheduled.  If she shows up her again, I will defend my children and myself to the full extent of the law. If she breaches my door I will physically do whatever is necessary to ensure she is no longer a threat to my safety.\"\n\nFemale cop: \" Woaw.  Hold on, if she comes back call us\".\n\nMe:\"no, you're already here. You're not going to do anything about what she's just done,  I have video proof of that. If she comes back, I'm going to assume she's trying to harm me or my children, and I'll call the police as soon as the threat is neutralized. I'm not risking my life waiting for you to get here, you're already showing me you don't care.\"\n\n\nThat video along with everything else was handed over to my lawyer.\n\nI was also a part of a men's group. For fathers goung through similar situations. My story was relatively tame compared to what some of these guys went through. I watched a video of one of the guys being assaulted by his ex, I'm talking full on closed fists punched to the face, I don't recall how many but there were alot  maybe 5 or 6 good clean shots, he finally had enough and hit her back. And HE went to jail. Police wouldn't even look at the video. She went to his house. Uninvited, assaulted him and HE was arrested for punching her.\n\nSorry to rant   still a touchy subject.  But in answer to your question.   Yes the system is rigged against men.  I firmly believe that is why suicide rates are 78% higher in men.",

It can be exhausting and unsettling to say the least when you can't find real help. I don't know how helpful the below info will be, but know I feel you.\n\nHere is some google copy paste for ya from [this](https://www.the-sun.com/tech/4432506/what-is-an-airtag/) article:\n\n\"How can you avoid being stalked with an AirTag?\n\nSince the AirTag is usually put in a bag or attached to an object, PCMag.com recommends that you regularly check your bags, purses, and luggage.\n\nFurthermore, it is recommended that you open your mail before returning home if you use a P.O. Box or a rented mailbox.\n\nAdditionally, you can also check behind the license plate of your car, the edge of your windshield, below the hood of your car, and the wheel wells on your car or bike to locate any AirTag used for tracking.\"\n\nSo after reading that, I believe your next steps are to thouroughly look through anything she could have come in contact with or follow the Apple support link [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227) for exactly your issue.  [Here](https://mashable.com/article/how-to-disable-unwanted-airtags-apple#:~:text=If%20you%20can%27t%20manage%20to%20find%20the%20unwanted,or%20remove%20the%20battery.%20Credit%3A%20screenshot%20%2F%20apple) is another article for Android users. \n\nI also learned that when you find the AirTag you can twist it apart to remove the battery. I personally would want to relocate the found tag or tags to a cop car or shopping cart somewhere.\n\nBest of luck OP!",

When the DA saw everything he went back and retroactively added charges for all the shit the cop had browbeaten her into not reporting.\n\nI had no idea how useless the cops were when it comes to harassment until my sister actually needed them.  Its so ridiculous, its like they are cliched characters in a hollywood movie.",

Always a variation of \"be glad you lost weight, go outside more often and you'll feel less tired, eat more fiber.\" \n\nThen when it's at a way worse complication \"wHy DiDn'T yOu SaY aNyThInG?\".  I'm not proud to say it but I lost control of my temper for a moment when that happened. I had my calender on my phone with the dates of the appointments. I yelled. Being lectured like I was an ignorant 5 year old. I yelled at them when I told them I'd been here three times and was told to go outside more often and eat more bread. Turns out walking around with a little tear in the large intestine aggravates the wound. And it'd been aggravated enough to start bleeding. It's also a risk for sepsis or septicemia, I forget which they said.\n\nAll it took was stomach pain turning into a fever, vomiting, and bleeding when using the restroom for them to final fucking do something. Fucking infuriating when they only care because \"well you can't fake this fever\". Go fuck yourself. Thank fuck my deeply Republican state paradoxically has socialized healthcare if you are little to no income. When mentioning cost \"why not go to the community center to see about the such and such program?\". No idea what they were talking about. When I said I didn't know we had a community center, let alone health plans... \"Well, they don't like it when we advertise it\". You what?",

When a woman is attacked or victimised, other women share their stories in private, they support that person. With men it’s different. It’s lonely. By a lot of men there’s shame attached to it. I don’t know where you are, but if in the US, my  response would be ‘can a woman not fire a gun?’  A narcissist/sociopath, etc will ruin lives no matter what their sex. There isn’t a different law for men and women. For men everywhere, and yourself, don’t let this go. Ask them how they would treat a woman with a stalker. Ask if the law is different for men. Pick apart their argument, and be safe.",
