I have amassed 20k followers on Instagram and a few sponsors, so I know I need to keep lifting to have content to post, but I also know I want that next trophy.

            "text": "I'm gonna approach this answer a different way:\n\n1. When I was about 11 years old, I was the smallest kid in sixth grade, and I hated it. I was bullied a lot. All my older siblings and cousins (who were 3+ years older than me and gone through puberty, so duh) were all giants compared to me, and knew how to play sports without embarrassing themselves. So I started working out six days a week, keeping a workout journal. Pushups, situps, squats, calf raises, chin ups - 3 sets of 6 was my mantra. This gave me a habit, but the motivation wouldn't last, because...\n2. I hit high school and suddenly people weren't gaping racist assholes to me, the \"tiny chinese dick kid\" every day because there was suddenly diversity and saying anything like that would get you two black eyes. My motivation to work out at this point was mostly tied to wanting to be popular rather than wanting to avoid taunts and beatings (not like it worked anyway... racists gonna racist). So I joined sports teams doing things like gymnastics and pole vaulting that were fun because the guys I did it with were fun, and we all kinda pushed each other to get better every day. Still an external motivation here.\n3. I hit college and I'm not working out the way I used to, hitting the gym every day with weights and such. I no longer have the community around me that I had in high school, so I find a new one: competitive ballroom dance. I'm practicing dance 12-15 hours per week, and again, it's external motivation, so I'm there because everyone else will be there and if I'm not, I'm disappointing someone (like my dance partner).\n4. I graduate college. I'm aimless for a couple years. No working out whatsoever until I get fired from my first job and have to move back home. I have lots of time on my hands and I just think \"well if I'm gonna be a loser in the middle of the recession (2008) I might as well be fit\" so I started running every day and taking hydroxycut. I dropped almost 40 pounds in about 2 months, 195ish to 155ish. **you'll notice a pattern here that even though I'd been \"physically healthy\" my entire life my motivations were at best dubious.\n5. This pattern continues through my entire adult life as my mental health issues from the horrible shit I went through in childhood went unaddressed. I was simultaneously struggling with what I recognize now as disordered eating (thanks, therapy). See, folks who don't live a life where they dread waking up because \"something awful will happen to them and things almost never get better\" can usually just eat food because they need nutrients. I mostly ate food to stave off dread. So I was the type who had to enjoy EVERY meal. I would spend so much fucking mental effort on deciding on what particular thing would make my days bearable. It also meant giant weight swings. I don't know as someone 5'10 who had been an athlete what a normal weight range for me is. But every couple of years I oscillate between 165ish at a low and 210ish at a high. And not because I'm a fucking body builder. It's because I overeat for a year and then crash diet for a year. All tied to my stress eating, which at this point I'd been doing for close to 30 years, it all started with the racist taunting in grade school. Now that I'm working on it and naming the problem, I find that I'm fucking FORGETTING TO EAT which is the opposite problem what the fuck.\n6. Which brings me to now. I've recently rejoined a gym, just to have something to do in the mornings before work. No one to impress. No particular goals in mind. I just... had the energy. Probably because I've been working on putting down a lot of the \"survival\" instincts I'd built up that would never let me thrive. I just wanted to do something for myself is all. I'm not pushing myself the way I used to in points 1-5 of this post. I just want to keep moving and such. I go about 4 days a week. Sometimes more or less if I'm feeling it. But I'm actually paying attention to my body. Therapy has helped me sort out a lot of the intrusive thoughts I have always had about my self worth and such, and suddenly, I can now go to the gym and do things for myself - not to avoid getting beat up, not to be popular or good looking. But because I want to stay healthy, for me. And the fact that I have the energy to do it at all... is because I'm working on letting go of all the mental shit that was holding me back.\n\nMy point in writing all of this is that I was always physically capable of doing athletic shit my whole life. But the issue of motivation for me was always a binary between having a gun to my head, or being so tired of having a gun to my head that I just give up.\n\nI'm trying to find a third way for myself. Where there's no more external pressure to stay \"motivated\" except that I want to do something for me. I'm recognizing how little in my life I'd done ANYTHING truly for myself that wasn't motivated out of some external fear.  \n\nI guess your motivations will change over time. Some of them will be sustainable (feed those) some of them won't... and for the motivations that aren't sustainable, maybe you should investigate why it's so hard to do something nice for yourself. Maybe you're not weak, maybe you're just tired all the time because there are stresses you've gotten so used to that you can't even recognize the weight you're carrying anymore because it's become a part of you.\n\nExcuse me if some of this didn't make much sense but I've been trying to be honest more than presentable lately.",

Now I solely practice to vent extra-tension (went back to college, working 7/7 either on my classes or in my part-time job).

And I think you need something to push you to do that. Whether that's just wanting to look better, feel better, whatever. Anything you can use to find motivation is good. Because it'll be Wednesday evening, you'll get home from a long day at work and heading to the gym looks a pretty poor substitute for grabbing a pizza and settling in for some Netflix or PlayStation.\n\nFor me, once I'm hooked I'm really into it though. You start to feel stronger and fitter, you start to look better, people start noticing and paying you compliments. And I actually started 'needing' to work out every day, I'd actually feel anxious or 'not right' if I left it for more than a day. I'm also really motivated by setting benchmarks and beating them. Maybe you get your 5k time down to 25 minutes, well now I want to get it down to 24. I want to be lifting more than I could last month. \n\nGetting started takes motivation, sticking with it takes discipline, but once you're used to it and 'hooked' it becomes really easy.",

It was so monotonous, boring and one-dimensional.. Also I am the kind of guy that wants fast results on something on order to continue working on that, and I cannot 'trust the process' (I am working hard on changing that aspect of myself and have patience but that is another story).\n\nThen I started CrossFit. And it took me 3-4 weeks, of 4 times each week on average, going to 1-hour long training and I had great results.. Everyday is fun, training programs are different every day, you build everything evenly (from muscles to endurance and flexibility) and you meet new people.\n\nSo I think finding something that suits your personality and achieving goals is the key to keep going and be happy that it is time to hit the gym, rather than thinking 'oh god do I have to go today, it is raining as well!'",

It's fun to do maybe once or twice a week, but filling that time in with something else and doing such a huge amount of research into how much protein I should be eating, understanding what my body needs in order to fuel itself better, better form on excercises and just all-in-all filling up the time with what I would consider something healthy has drastically increased my confidence, and made me appreciate life more.\n\nBut I'm going to be honest, if it's not something you're interested in you're not magically just gonna start enjoying it. Too many people advertise the gym as if it's this necessity in everyday life, it's not. It'll just end up wasting your money if you don't genuinely enjoy being there.  \n\nIf you're genuinely keen to lose weight, start by tracking your calories and eating less than what you normally would, you'd be surprised, but your diet consists of about 98% of weight loss, and the other 2% is from how active you are.",

While it is my default, I did 2 years of Brazilian jiu jitsu going roughly 3 or 4 times a week. That was easily the best shape I was ever in and the most fun exercising I have done. Boxing and kickboxing were great too. As long as you get off the couch, challenge yourself, raise your heart rate and break a sweat and are able to have fun while doing it, it comes easier.

If you go in and just use 3 machines and leave yeah no shit you're not going to stay on track but if you have an actual plan youll be more likely to stick to it. if you hate going to the gym just dont go, find something else that you like doing instead. i have always loved lifting weights myself, but if you dont try swimming or biking or something. really at the end of the day if youre constantly searching for motivation to go to the gym you probably dont want it badly enough and should spend effort in other areas. Why do i spend 3 hours in thw gym a day, 6 days a week? Because i fucking love it. Do i have to? No. Do i want to? Yes. As long as you get some form of cardio in and have some form of resistance training at least 2 timer per week youll be fine.

I just feel so much better after I have been going to the gym. It’s like meditation, I just do my thing for 1 hour while listening to my favourite music. I like the feeling of muscles burning and of my muscles recorvering during the week. I also feel like eating healthy because I have worked out so much. It’s a positive circle loop which really benefits my mental health as well. I see muscle gain as a side effect from going to the gym.

Then she wanted a trainer (just someone at the local globo gym.) Then she wanted to do a bodybuilding show (she’s done 2.) Then she got her personal training certification…\n\nSomewhere in there (8-9 years ago) she got to the point where she was out-lifting some of the guys at her gym (not the gym-rat types, but certainly the skinny newbie types.) It got to the point she could lift about as much as I (not having set foot in a gym since HS) thought I could probably lift.\n\nSomehow that didn’t sit well with my (apparently more fragile than I thought) male ego. So I joined the nearby globo gym myself. Within a week I was going 3x weekly at 6-6:30am. Within 6 months I was there 5-6x weekly at opening (5am.) Within a year I’d stopped ego-lifting and started to work on form as well as (what I thought at the time was) strength.\n\nAnd… if I’m being honest (probably wouldn’t admit this if it weren’t so common) my wife and I went through a rough patch (or two) in there somewhere and I thought we might not make it. So that motivated me to get/stay in shape in case I found myself suddenly “on the market” again. (If you don’t go to the gym much, it might surprise you how many recently-divorced middle-aged guys are there. Or their marriages are on the rocks.)\n\nWhen covid hit I scrambled to put together a home gym (along with what my wife already had, which was dumbbells, punching bag and a cable system.) Basically we now have a platform, a 25mm/15kg women’s oly bar, a 28.5mm 20kg bar, 160kg of bumpers and full change plates set, lousy rack, treadmill, rower. That’s enough for me to not go back to globo…\n\nTurns out, for me, it’s now 4 things:\n\n• habit (don’t underestimate the power of habit/routine.)\n\n• it’s a mental break or release for me.\n\n• pre-covid it was also mildly social. The gym 3 blocks away from me tends to have the same smallish crowd at 5am, so if someone doesn’t show up, you notice.\n\n• I want to build as much muscle as possible now so I’m not a frail senior citizen constantly worried about falling or whatever.\n\nI suppose I could also add that my 21 y.o. son decided to get into bodybuilding himself maybe two or three years ago. For the moment (despite several injuries over the past year) I can still out-lift the kid. It wont be like that forever, so I’ll cling to it as long as I can.",

Everything from seeing results to the idea of being checked out because of your body to having a really tough workout, taking a shower, and plopping down on the couch to relax and eat some warm food.\n\n5. There are a lot of asshole gym rats out there who are full of themselves and judge other people constantly, and that kind of builds a negative stereotype around working out and getting in good shape. I love to help people get in shape or get started. I love to give people pointers when they are afraid to ask for help or go to the gym. There is a lot of negativity in the fitness world, and the better shape I get into and the more I learn, the more I have a leg to stand on and the more it means when I help someone who doesn't know as much about it.",

Another one of its appeals is the objective measure by how strong you are in certain lifts.\nBut the biggest takeaway is the transferrable skill of tackling a form of impossibility. There will always be a number on the barbell that you cannot move - for now! Powerlifting gives you a repeatable and relatively-consistent opportunity to work towards that impossibility with by showing up and giving some effort with a present mind. One day, you'll be warming up and repping numbers that you struggled to do just once. The takeaway from that is that you develop as a person with a confidence to tackle other actual real-life-problems that seem impossible.",

My Bench is at poverty numbers as my 1RM is 275, Squat is 315, Deadlift 405 which brings my PL total to around 995. I'd like to total 1100 pounds at some point. I want to hit a 315 bench, 350 squat, and a 450 deadlift by February. My current programming will get me there. All I have to do is show up. \n\nNow, I say for now because the reality is, is that I'm not going to compete and my pursuit of numbers is not sustainable especially being 40 years old with no coach, team, and being drug free. So soon, my motivation will need to come from somewhere else. I do find motivation in not having the typical 'dad bod' and in not looking like the other 40 years olds around me. I've been tempted to turn to the dark side and have consulted with a sports endocrinologist to interpret my hormones and because I've been active all my life, my numbers there show better than the typical person my age so though he'll approve TRT, right now, it's not needed. \n\nNumbers and totals are great motivators but it's a fine line between lifting recreationally being and being consumed by lifting. I've trained through injuries, a literal broken back, and through sickness and though, when I was younger, it wasn't a big deal, my brain is still convinced that age isn't a factor with these things even though coming back from a simple stiff neck will take me a couple of days to recover from. \n\nAlso, answering questions like this is a motivator. I don't get many opportunities to talk about working out and being passionate about lifting as I'm conscious enough to avoid that conversation with people unless they bring it up. I mean, if I start going off the rails about the merits of lifting, bar speed, Wilkes, and all that without being prompted, it comes off as preachy, kind of.",

            "text": "I used to be a fatass about four years ago.\n\n6'2 and 355lb of fatty fatness. I was pre-diabetic, had apnea, acid reflux, joint pain, you name it. Now I'm 198 with 12% bodyfat, and all of the issues above are gone. This is how it happened. \n\nOne day after eating this double and chili-cheese fries with ranch from Sonic, I went to the bathroom to wash up. I looked in the mirror and saw chili on my shirt. I looked up and it was like seeing myself for the first time in a long time. I was ashamed of myself, that I would eat like I did, like a pig at a trough, and that I looked like I did. I was disgusted. I had seen that same look from other people, that look of disgust, and often pity as well. I decided in that moment to do something about it, to actually change my life. \n\nI went home, started researching, and the next morning I went to the grocery store to try a new food plan. I tossed all of the bullshit candy and hostess cakes and gave my beer away (three cases worth). I started reducing portions for two weeks. Then I switched out fried stuff for grilled stuff. Then fries for things like sweet potatoes. More veggies. I started losing weight and was highly encouraged. \n\nI knew that I would have to start exercising, so I had [a DEXA scan](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/10683-dexa-dxa-scan-bone-density-test#:~:text=A%20DEXA%20scan%20is%20an,body%20fat%20and%20muscle%20mass.) done and brought that to a locally-owned gym close to my house. They pointed me in the direction of an in-house coach who sat down with me later tha afternoon and outlined exactly what my caloric goals needed to be to get to X weight, Y SMM (skeletal muscle mass), and Z BF%.\n\nFrom there, I simply adhered to the food and did my workouts. He taught me proper form, how to use machines and free weights, and a couple of forms of cardio (stairs and treadmill). Weight kept dropping, muscle mass increased, and bodyfat shrank. Clothes started getting loose. I was using smaller notches on my belt. After six months, I had a checkup and got a glowing review. I was no longer pre-diabetic and my joints felt great. I couldn't recall the last episode of acid reflux. I was still using a CPAP at that time to be safe. Had another DEXA scan and man, talk about night and day.\n\nI don't always want to work out, but I do it anyway, and I never regret it. **That is the difference between being motivated and being disciplined. Motivation wanes, discipline is what keeps you on track**. You have to make the mental choice that you want better for yourself, and you stay with it through thick and thin. \n\nSo to wrap an already-long post, I simply kept at it and I'm here now, with the numbers mentioned above and a state of mental health that I didn't believe I would have. \n\nThe physique improvements are huge and quite frankly I was stunned at how differently people treated me, especially women, but the true benefit of lifting is what it does for you mentally. It strengthens you in ways you cannot begin to imagine. The challenges you face when you're gassed and you dig the fuck deep to finish your work translates across the board of life.",

I was 260 pounds 18 months ago, pretty much always chubby in high school, then blew up in college and got fat/obese. Lost about 80 pounds in 10 months via diet and then slowly started exercising. The thing about the gym is you can't rely on motivation. Motivation is a feeling or an emotion. Just like you can't rely on being happy all the time, you can't rely on motivation. Going to the gym, whether it's once a week, 3x, 5x or whatever, has to become part of your life. Similar to going to work, or brushing your teeth or showering (i hope ). You just do it. How you feel about it, is completely irrelevant. You just go. Sometimes it's the best workout ever, sometimes it's not. But you always go. When motivation comes, that's when you can go after PR's and really get great intense work outs in. When it leaves and it's a drag to go, you might just go through the motions, but you go. I go now because I enjoy it, I love challenging myself early in the morning before work.

I've done and said a lot of dumb shit and do so on a near daily basis so I'll never really run out of reasons to continue punishing myself regularly. I just see it as something I have to do. Like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. You could be tired as hell after a long ass day at work and etc but you still know you can't go to bed without taking a shower even if you don't want to. When you wake up, you know you have to brush your teeth even if you feel too tired to, likewise for before bed. So think of it like that. Even if you don't want to do it, you have to blot out that 1-2 hours for a workout. If you do HIIT maybe you can even get it done quicker than that. Maybe you have serious goals like strength, weight loss, physique, appearance, etc then you would feel motivated to do it, idk. but I don't so it's just an obstacle in my path through each day.\n\nThe thing for me is that I don't really truly believe in motivation. It sounds corny and dumb, but I feel like when you're 'motivated' to do things you enjoy it's just a bodily craving and physical excitement for the dopamine you expect from doing those things. Anytime I've tried psyching myself into feeling 'motivated' to work out, it all dissipates the amount I actually start doing it. Then comes the sheer pain and discomfort.\n\nTL;DR: I use working out as a means of punishing myself for being an idiot. I see it as a mandatory step through the day, like any other daily habit you may enforce upon yourself, which gets me into the gym and keeps me from delaying sets by wasting time on my phone or staring off into the distance, talking to people, etc, it's not necessarily real \"motivation\" like you may be wanting.

            "text": "TL:DR - im motivated to go to the gym regularly because it redirects my energy into a positive outlet, gives me more self-confidence, and helps me start off the day with a clear and centered mind. When something gives me that combination of benefits, it feels less like a chore and more like a gift. I don't have to work out every day, i get to work out every day. \n\nRead below for a longer explanation\n\n----\n\nThe simplest answer would be that i find it enjoyable, but i guess you want to know specifically what i enjoy about it. for me, its deeply tied to making it the first thing i do in the morning and the setting in which i do it. \n\nMy routine on a perfect day is 2 hours of shooting hoops, an hour of lifting, and a half hour to an hour of sauna time or yoga. Most days I only have time for the cardio and one more thing, but i do my best to go for everything as often as possible. \n\nAn older version of me would probably look at this schedule and think i had a lobotomy or something, but that version of me was deeply depressed and looking for something easy to fill the time with. \n\nNow, I'm happy to say that going to the gym is honestly the highlight of most of my days and truly gives me a feeling of inner peace and progress that nothing else has been able to replace. Whenever i have to take time away from the gym for travel or whatever, i worry about being able to get back into it when i return for fear of falling back into my old ways but every time i find myself back there first thing in the morning, ready to pick up where i left off. As a matter of fact, any time i find myself engaging in something i used to waste way more time on, it's like that shrill piercing compulsion to engage in those bad habits has been replaced with a calming and reassuring beckoning to return to the place where i can just turn my brain off and work up a sweat. But it wasnt always like this obviously. I went through a really traumatic break-up that forced me to confront a lot of issues i had been able to avoid thinking about because of the brain space i had devoted to someone else. If this is coming across as blaming that person, im not. i was always responsible for my own weaknesses and decisions, even if they came as easily and naturally as the strengths and persona satisfaction ive been able to cultivate into the next phase of my life. \n\nWhen I got back into the gym, it was purely a matter of seeing the benefits pay off in real time in a way i hadnt seen in years, and especially not with the benefit of exercise in mind. The most useful tools for me at that stage was an app called BodySpace and the daily program i was able to follow with it. For some people i imagine having a workout plan may be a source of anxiety and expectation, but when you find yourself where I did, any kind of direction is better than feeling lost. So this went on for a few months and the results were paying off like you wouldnt believe. Eventually however, they started to plateau and I started to feel frustrated and burdened. As much as I enjoyed seeing the results and even just the identity of being someone that works out regularly, I needed something else to keep me coming back or i knew i would grow to resent paying someone for the right to lift heavy things and put them back down again. That's when i really got back into basketball.\n\nThere's a zen like inner peace i get from getting to the gym as soon as it opens and just knocking out 2-3 hours of shooting hoops and lifting. There's very few people there and the basketball court is pretty much always empty or there's just one other person, so being able to walk into this giant room and have the run of the place to do whatever i want is really gratifying, especially if im coming from a tiny ass apartment. I was never the kind of person to say this sincerely, but it gotten to the point where the gym truly feels more like my home than my actual home. I'm a big guy and just having the space and freedom to move around as much as i want in any given direction is nice, but when you pair it with the dopamine hit of perfecting a jump shot...there's just nothing else to compare it to. Throw some decent music in there on a slow day and the next thing i know its 6 hours later and im drenched in sweat, with no explanation for where the time went beyond an awareness that i wouldnt have spent it anywhere else.",

I am in my early 30s, and have finally accepted that I am going to be working until my late 50s/early 60s. This prompted me to put my physical health as a high priority, so when I can finally retire, I'll still be fully capable of traveling and doing things that I love, for as long as I can. I also recognized that physical activity really does help tremendously with my emotional balance, and drastically helps with avoiding or quickly moving through bouts of depression. Those two together made me realize it was best for my health to do this.\n\nI started off slow, but now go five days a week. As a lot of others have mentioned, it's just become a part of my daily structure or routine. It now genuinely feels unnatural not to have it as part of this routine. \n\nAlso as others have said, motivation can be fleeting, making discipline a stronger driver. On days I felt like I didn't want to, I basically had the \"well you're doing it anyway\" talk with myself. Never once have I regretted forcing myself to go. Motivation can be very helpful, but discipline is what you should lean into.\n\nSomething I didn't notice in the comments: start off slow. Test the waters with each new machine/workout you do, and find what is comfortable. Work on form above all else first, and then increase weight and intensity. Pushing yourself too hard at first will give you intense muscle pains, and put you off to the idea. Although I go to the gym 5 days a week now, I first started at 3, and for 2 months before even going to the gym I did body weight exercises at home. Point being, I worked slowly into it, so my body was better prepared, making the process of integrating it into my routine a much smoother process.\n\nOn a final note, if there is one thing I wish I had accepted sooner, it's that the process of building muscle takes time. You will not be ripped in 2 or 3 months. Hell, you probably won't notice significant changes for a long time. I am 8 months into this, and only recently am I noticing significant improvements. And even those improvements are nothing compared to guys who have been at this for YEARS. Those dudes with huge pecs and biceps? They've been going to the gym for multiple years. It can be easy to compare yourself and get discouraged, but just remember that EVERYONE started where you are.",

It's like sculplting.\nThe last and most important imo, is the high you get from the winning affect.\nWhat do I mean by this?\nWell, in order to build a muscular physique, one has to improve in their excercises. This means getting stronger or increasing the reps. This is something that is actually pretty difficult, and gets even harder the more and more you workout. So when you finally achieve that strength goal on an excercise that you've been working for, for months, the high you get is amazing. \nThe neurotransmitters you get from achieving a goal is amazing, and with weight training, there are so many goals you can achieve. This constant battle for hitting these personal records at the gym have a tremendous carry over to your everyday life. I believe that anyone who becomes accustomed to failing and succeeding through excercise, has a better chance of becoming succesfull in their business and work, not only through increasing confidence. But by learning to believe in the power of hard work.\n\nSo in summary, working out will keep you healthy, make you look good, and improve your ability to achieve things in life.\n\nThat's why i'm motivated to workout.",

I had exercise-induced asthma, and really resented how much it prevented me from a lot of physical activity while everyone else was able to run around freely without issue, play sports, etc. One day I just decided that I'd had enough of that, and I wanted to change.\r  \n\r  \nAs a mid-30's adult, that same motivation has evolved into an appreciation for how much lifting has improved my mental well-being from two major standpoints: Stress-relief and confidence.\r  \n\r  \nFrom a stress-relief perspective, nothing clears the mind faster than the act of putting heavy weight over yourself. The only thought in the mind is to move the weight correctly while focusing on the muscle contractions; if you're distracted, injuries happen so it kind forces me to focus on just this one task. Nothing else matters in those moments I'm moving weight.\r  \n\r  \nFor confidence, that doesn't stem from LOOKING good but rather, seeing the progress in the numbers of reps or increase in weight over time that I can move, and understanding that I started with a physical prowess of exactly ZERO. More importantly, these improvements didn't come easy, nor did they come without their failures. However, through each failure I NEVER GAVE UP. I kept relentlessly pushing because I just wanted it; if one method didn't work, fine. I'll find a different way that'll work, and eventually I did. Every time. And any time I'm at work faced with a project that seems insurmountable, I just think back to the lifts that I thought were just as impossible and how I still managed to break through every time. It gives me a sense of belief in myself that I've never had before.\r  \n\r  \nSo I keep going. Keep pushing to be better for no one else but myself, in order to shut up my own worst critic: me.",

He's not super heavy, he's got *some* muscles and *some* fat while pushing ~180lbs at 5'7\". I'm the same height and much thinner, and want to stay under 140 lbs.\n\nThen it was \"Going to the gym doesn't work but I remember enjoying riding my bike, and my knees can't handle running.\"  I bought a hybrid (flat bar, sorta but not really road bike) to see if I'd stick with it. Rode a day or two a week to get my literal ass acclimated to it, and bumped up to 3-4 days each week and a couple extra miles to each ride each week. By 3 months I was able to ride 30 miles in one go. The following year I splurged like a motherfucker on a nice carbon road bike.\n\nNow, my motivation for riding regularly is getting to ride. Quite literally, the more I ride, the more *I want* to ride; the more *I get* to ride. My cravings change too. When I'm super into it, I eat better because that's the shit I want. I want protein, vegetables, less fatty things, less sugary things, and carbs out the wazoo if I plan on riding 40+ miles one day on the weekend.\n\nThere, of course, are now little goals. How fast can I go up this hill? Can I maintain this speed to get all green lights? Can I hit an average speed of 14MPH? Can I maintain 23MPH over my most ridden stretch of road to break my PB?\n\nTo me, when I'm really in it, cycling is something that's really fun to do that happens to be exercise.

I usually put on an audio book, youtube video, or podcast and listen to some stuff while cycling through my workouts. \n\nI was also in the Marines from 2008-2013 and received a back injury, herniated disc in my spine. I had to take 6 months of physical therapy after the surgery and the doctor told me in the future, if I gained a lot of weight and stuff I would be at a higher risk for repeated injury with my spine. As a result, after I got out of the military I've been pretty regularly trying to be healthy. I used to run a lot, but over time, because of age and laziness, shifted to more weight lifting and etc. \n\nI consider it one of my hobbies. I work out, play video games, research random technology stuff,  watch anime, and work. I'm 6', 194 lbs, and range between 13.5% -14.5% body fat. The way I see it for most of my friends, they all have the time to work out, it's just they choose not to and it's not a priority for them, which is fine. Everyone has the time though and it's their choice how they allot it. 3 hours watching a basketball game, 2 hours watching a TV show, etc. you can do that while in the gym.",

            "text": "I use to go to and really like Orange Theory Fitness. In the past I never kept up with gym memberships or home equipment (including P90X). Orange theory requires you to book the class in advance because they fill up. You have to be there in time, so I don't get to play the game of putting it off 15 minutes after 15 minutes until I'm too hungry to go. And they charge a penalty fee if you don't make it or cancel the same day. This might sound sleazy, but it worked great as a physiological motivator. The other reason I liked it is they control the workout - I'd slack in a gym if my routine (legs) off left up me. The other thing I liked is the app and tracking my progress. So it really worked for me and I was in the best shape of my life save when I was on the crew team in college. You can do everything they do cheaper elsewhere, but cost was worth it to me.\n\nI stopped going to Orange Theory with covid. I got a Peloton at home and trx bands. Peloton gives me similar motivation to Orange theory, but I eventually broken the habit over the last few months. I need to start again, but it won't be hard once I set regular time in my calendar. Trx apparently is doing live classe, and I want to try them. I personally need that to keep motivated because staring at a person on the same continual loop on their app was actually reducing my motivation.",

He had been obese for years at this point, and it seemed to be wearing on him, only getting worse as he got older. My brother and I were/still are great friends.\n\nI could see his insecurities about his body already forming, and his confidence levels low. Even as a 17 year old I knew if this wasn’t corrected now, he would go off to college being insecure/depressed where it could possibly get worse. \n\nBasically sat him down and was like “look man, your weight is starting to get out of control”,  he silently nodded, I said “I want you to go to the gym with me, all I ask is you go 5x per week, and train with me. I’ll show you how to do everything”. He agreed. \n\nI’ll never forget his first attempt at bench press. He was maybe 5’09 and 180lbs of fat at this point, and he couldn’t bench more than 55lbs. I assured him that in 2 weeks, he’ll be pushing more weight. And he did. He also ran a mile after every workout, gradually getting faster.\n\nAfter 2 short months, he lost 25lbs. He transformed into a totally different person, essentially he had burned off all his fat and was now thin. I remember 2 girls in his grade were at the gym, and commented to me how good he looks now. He walked around with his chest out and you could see his newfound confidence. \n\nThen, he started eating right, focusing on building muscle. He starts developing noticeable muscles, and when I would take him to parties with me, he was hooking up with girls in my grade lol. \n\nAfter the summer, I went off to the army, but his lifting habit remained. Years later, we’re both in our 20s, and he’s now ripped (bigger than me). He once told me with tears in his eyes, how taking him to the gym literally changed his whole life, and sometimes wonders how different his life would’ve been, had he not got into shape when he did.\n\nIt’s my favorite memory from our childhood.",

Didnt love it, but I had that motivation.\nWhen I left school and went into university/college, I stopped working out for a whole semester cause I was too focused on studies. On the second one I took swimming at the campus pool and realised not only my grades went up a bit, but i felt better overall. After that I started watching some calisthenics videos (those guys training Handstand Push ups, planche, front lever, etc) and it really got me motivated. I wanted to achieve that! So little by little I started working out again. I started enjoying my weeks much more, had more energy and at some point, excercise becomes some sort of good adiction: if you miss one or two trainings in a week, you kindda feel bad (bad on a \"I really should have workes out\". \nFlash forward to this day (I'm 22), started getting into a healthier lifestyle too! Sleeping a bit more, cooking my own meals, etc.\n\nSo overall I'd say:\n\n-Motivation to progress on the excercises I do (calisthenics)\n\n-Working out helps me rest my head and not think about anything study/work related\n\n-I really enjoy the feel after a workout\n\n-I kindda feel bad if I miss too much training at this point",

I kind of plateaued there for a while and couldn't seem to lose more. I got on and off bad habits for a while with covid, my weight fluctuated between about 185-195\n\nIn the past 3 months I have taken on a personal trainer, I track my macros as well as calorie intake, and do more gym based weights than I ever did before. \n\nI'm now 180lb, but more muscle mass.  At 36 years of age, I am easily in the best shape of my life, but there's still room for improvement, for both fitness and stength.\n\nRecently, it's the gradual improvement of muscle mass and stamina, being able to work with slightly heavier weights, being able to run on the treadmill for longer, and honestly, being happier with what I see in the mirror.

That means feeling better and living longer, with less chances of health problems later in life. Old people tell me to be healthy when I'm young so I dont have to worry about it as much when I'm old and tired all the time.\n\n7. It's fun!

Proper nutrition, exercises, muscle groups etc. may seem like a lot at first but like with anything you'll learn all that stuff eventually with continued interest.\n\n8.

Most likely from lifting too much, too often, with questionable form for high school sports). So once I got out of the habit of riding it took until last month for me to start again. \n\nMy friend also has a Peloton so we hold each other accountable. We have the times we ride together scheduled and we bust each other's balls if the other one backs out. This time I made sure that I tried to take things slow and did only 20 minute beginner rides for 3 weeks before going into normal rides. The first month was not that fun but I stuck with it. I'm now going on an 8 week streak, with the majority of those weeks with 3 or more rides. \n\nThe last two weeks things have really started to click.

It just happened that my social life and extracurricular life was driven by sports and exercise was part of that. But after college, I got fat pretty fast (classic case of no change in diet an 100% change in activity level). Still, I wasn't unhappy as a fat guy, I was a happy guy getting fatter because of all the fun things I was doing. \n\nIt wasn't until I had kids that I got unhappy with myself. I didn't want the fat version of myself to be what they remembered, and also (morbidly), I didn't want to die early and abandon them prematurely because I was too selfish/lazy to take care of myself (which I now view as part of taking care of them). So yeah, I completely identify with people who don't exercise regularly. I did that for a long time, and I wasn't constantly feeling guilty about it, it was just who I was. \n\nGood news is that I learned you don't really need motivation forever, it doesn't take very long for your body/mind to adapt to and prefer a new version of yourself and your routine. You just need motivation for a few months while you redefine your baseline, and soon you realize you don't want to skip your workouts anymore. For me, it was about 2 months (25 workouts) into weightlifting in my backyard that I realized I was looking forward to my workouts in the same way I remember looking forward to gamedays. For example, one day I got slammed at work and couldn't get out there to lift until late at night. My wife said something like \"I'm proud of you for still getting your workout in\" and I realized how much my frame of mind had changed. I had spent the whole day looking forward to that workout, and the last thing I wanted to do was end a LONG workday without dong the one fun thing I'd planned for the day. \n\nAlso, speaking of the wife, don't be afraid to make yourself accountable to others. Tell your wife/kids/mom/gf/mailman that you started working out. That definitely helped me in the first couple months. Also, treat it like a hobby. Read the forums, read gear reviews, invest your couch time on your workouts indirectly. Even invest your cash. Sunk cost fallacy applies. You'll be motivated to make it work the more you've already invested, and soon you won't need the motivation anymore, you'll just be a person who ______ (runs, life, swims, bike, hikes, whatever).",

Not enough to be really noticeable to people, but I personally didn't like how my gut looked in the mirror. So I started eating healthier and more importantly, less. I lost the weight and felt better about myself. Absolutely no one noticed or said anything, but it was really more for myself.   \n\n\nI recognized I really liked that feeling of liking how I looked in the mirror. I also remembered a quote I once ready from Socrates saying it's a disgrace to grow old without seeing the beauty of your own body becoming fit. So baby steps I started running in the morning and occasionally doing bicep curls. I tracked my running with an app and took pleasure in watching my numbers improve. I also was feeling more fulfilled at the end of the day. I felt better, I slept better, and my mental health seemingly improved.   \n\n\nHere we are today. I'm at my desired weight. I run 3-4 times a week in the mornings for 30 mins. The days when I don't run I weight life with dumbbells' doing various exercises. All in all it's only 4 hours out of my week which isn't much.

Alot of processed, shitty food. Id stay up late drinking beer and smoking cigarettes. Then id have a giant plate of nachos, or house an entire frozen pizza to the dome. Then, like a light, something just switched. I realized I was the heaviest I'd ever been. And that if I continued eating like this, I'd probably die within a few years. I had actually quit cigarettes last October, so before starting the diet. But, whatever it was that snapped in me I'm glad it did. I cut out alot of the beer, but still drink beer a couple nights a week. No more soda, only water. I eat basically zero processed foods anymore, not alot of red meat, maybe a steak every few weeks. Switched hamburger meat for ground turkey in everything from burgers, to tacos (no shell i use a few leaves of romaine lettuce instead), to chilli. Lean meats, fish, fruits, veggies, whole grain wheat, brown rice. I work out consistently, 3 days, each day focusing on 2 different muscle groups. Rest one day.

I have been able to maintain a pretty fit body over the past 10 years with some fluctuations here and there. I’ve learned that everything in life is a trade off. It can be hard to get up early to workout before work some days and I definitely go through periods of feeling unmotivated. But I’ve come to decide that this sacrifice is easier for me than the feeling of unhappiness when my good pair of pants don’t fit anymore. Than the embarrassment I’d feel when I took my shirt off in public. But most importantly, the disappointment I’d have in myself when I’d look in the mirror unhappy with how I’d let myself go.\n\nFitness hasn’t fixed all my issues but it’s given me something to feel proud about. I can feel confident enough to playfully flirt with a cute girl I meet. I may not be happy with my extra skin but I’m content with my body knowing it’s the product of me doing my best to take care of it. The thought of losing all that progress and confidence that I’ve spent years building does not feel like an option I could willingly accept so I’ve found the discipline to keep me active even when my motivation waivers.",

I turned 31 and said to my self that i will only get fatter from here. In addition, i got dumped by my gf as well and I thought if i ever want a good looking gf i have to look good for her too and take care of my self. I only exercise my pecs and abs, just to look better and get some confidence and it really does help with that. I do 8 minutes per day because i would never be able to keep it up if i had to go to a gym 3-5 times a week, 45-60 minutes per session.\n8 minutes a day doesnt do much, but over time it really does. I dont have anything better to do so it would be dumb to not improve myself in some way. \n\nI recommend anyone who wants to workout a little bit to download an intervall timer and go 30 sec pushups and 30 sec situps with a 30 sec pause inbetween exercises, three times. Then you can just add seconds too your workout as you get stronger.",

I got more serious and more organized and saw a lot more muscle growth. \n\nBut what really inspired me to make a long term commitment to working out was a video by a weightlifting guru who was talking about how building and maintaining strength as you age can provide life altering difference in quality of life and independence later in life. This really resonated with me. I'm 47 and was already feeling old. Doing intense activities might leave me with aches and pains for days or weeks, or an injury that would nag for months. But after working out a few months I already realized that a lot of those aches and pains weren't caused by age but were caused by being weak af. Building strength over time by working out consistently makes you more than strong enough to do everyday tasks or more strenuous weekend/vacation activities. \n\nSo I'm working out to be strong enough to do what I want (snowboarding, paddleboarding, hiking) for as long as I want so I can enjoy life with my family and an active retirement with my wife.",

I knew I wasn’t in great shape but I never viewed myself in that light and I promised myself it would never happen again.\n\nPre-Covid I admittedly took it to extremes, I would work 9-10 hours a day counting commute, come home and do flexibility, or weight training for 30-45 minutes and then cardio for 1-2 hours 5 days a week. The other 2 days I would bike, or hike 6 hours a day, add in another 1-2 hours commute after I got bored of trails around me.\n\nLittle over a year after that and my training we went with 2 friends on a new hike, 2 days 1 night. I was not the weak link this time, on the return trip they all opted to move off the trail and walk the road back but I had spent over a year at this point I wasn’t going to quit on the hike. I hid my bag by the road and told them I’d meet them at the car, I then ran the trail the whole distance back and met them along the road to very confused faces. In that moment of looking at the confusion on how I made it back before them I’m not sure I’ve ever felt better about myself.\n\n\nUnfortunately for the past year I’ve been dealing with some neck issues and haven’t been able to workout at all much less regularly, but I can’t wait.",

So as a result, I put on a fair bit of weight and lost a lot of my strength and self confidence. In April last year, I went for a run on my old training route for the first time in 7 years as I was on furlough and bored. I was able to do the 1.5 mile run in roughly 12 minutes without any knee pains whatsoever. That convinced me that my knees were ok finally and I decided to apply to the RAF as a re-joiner. \n\nSpent most of last year and this year hitting the gym and doing a lot of long distance runs to get rid of the fat I had gained over the years and get my strength back up to my old levels. Unfortunately after getting messed around since October over my medical, I was informed in June that because I had Chronic Knee Pain in the Army, I was classed as Permanently Medically Unfit to re-join. \n\nSo bit annoyed and depressed that I wasted a year over a failed application when I could have done a HNC in Mechanical Engineering like I originally planned to, but on the upside, I've lost a lot of fat although I've still got some stubborn belly fat and love handles to deal with, I've slimmed down a lot so I look a lot better than I did last year, I'm a lot fitter now compared to when I was in the Army as I did struggle with PT back then and I feel a lot better with myself.\n\nSo even though I haven't been able to go back into the forces, I've got no desire to get fat again and I want to make myself stronger and look better so I may as-well keep going with the workouts.",

I did thank her.\nSo anyway….. it takes literally years to change who you are and then longer to discover who you really want to be. I used the gym 6 days a week. I’d get up at 4:30 am so I’d have 1.5 hours to workout and 30 min to shower and get to work. 45 min cardio 45 min strength training. Different muscle groups each day. After work I walked my dog up north mountain 3.5 miles Monday through Friday. I’d fall in bed exhausted, happy and sober. \nThat was 25 years ago and while I’m no longer a gym rat I’m still working out 3 days a week. And I’ve been sober for 25 years.

I had worked out off and on through the years but never anything long term. \n\nIn August of 2011 I decided to get into a regular routine. I purchased P90X and began doing those workouts. I didn't try to push it too much and steadily began a routine. I have always been thin so I didn't need to lose weight. I just wanted to get in some cardio, increase my strength and get toned up a bit. \n\nNow, ten years later I have kept at it. I have only missed a few weeks here and there because of travel and/or sickness. I did P90X for a couple of years, then started P90X3. I switched up and started doing BodyBeast. I subscribed to BeachBody On Demand and did A Week of Hard Labor and in the last couple of years I have been doing rounds of LIIFT4. I bulked up a bit over the years and am pretty strong for a 50 year old man. \n\nMy advice to anyone starting out is to take your time. Recognize that you can't come blazing out of the gate and push weight and reps like they do in the videos. Modify the exercises as necessary. \n\nI worked out enough to where it has become a habit. When I miss workouts I feel like shit. It has helped my depression along the way and coupled with mindfulness meditation I am a much happier and healthier person. \n\nI wasn't trying to reach a specific goal with workouts as much as I was developing a new lifestyle of fitness.\n\nMy Dad had his second heart attack in 2015. After a triple bypass he can hardly do much anymore. A lifetime of hard physical labor with two heart attacks stacked on top of that has left him depressed and ill-tempered. I don't wish to be that way so I try my best to take care of myself.",

I run my first marathon in 2 weeks! Fitness can be a form of meditation. Link the body and mind. You got this!",

I also had little motivation to do more physical activity when getting home from my already physical job.

Within a week of doing push ups, sit up and jumping jacks i noticed how much better i had gotten. My form got better, i struggled way less, i saw some results. I started only being able to do 20 push up (barely and with terrible form) and 5 weeks later i can now do 75 push, 100 sit ups and jumping jacks and i started weight lifting aswell.

My motivation is the look that I get from people who I haven't saw in some time, and you know the whole staying healthy for a better second half of life.

I’ve come to realize that I’ve developed a pretty unhealthy relationship with lifting weights. \nI didn’t know it at the time, but lifting weights for me was basically a roundabout way of hurting myself. I never had the same attitude about exercise than any workout partner or friend I’ve had, I used to not workout with my friends because they would never be able to match my intensity, and because it honestly felt strange showing such a raw version of myself to my closest friends. I always loved pushing myself past the breaking point, the sorer I was and the more it hurt, the more I enjoyed it. \nMy father committed suicide when I was 12, so the thought of self harm to me was a horrifying notion, to put it lightly. But “working out” is healthy, right? Even if you do it 7 days a week taking sadistic pleasure from your own suffering? That’s what I did. And It got me far enough. I thought I was Hercules, and looked the par. Got a job out of high school as an ironworker, because I loved being able to lift the giant metal beams and get a workout in on the job. \n\n2 years later and here I am with a damn near ruined spine, knees on the way out, and muscles so tight, mangled, and fucked up that I have to get muscle relaxant treatments.\n\nThank you for reading.

I was about 60 lbs overweight according to most height/weight charts, so getting healthy was part of my motivation but really I just wanted to learn how to physically defend myself. As it happened I discovered I had some moderate aptitude for martial arts and after a couple of years started competing (nothing big, local tournaments, that sort of thing). I stuck with it for about seven years, typically training anywhere from 3-12 hours a week. I stopped after what I can only describe as a bit of a falling out with my main instructor.\n\nOver the ensuing years I had a lot of challenges and my weight came back — plus more. Just recently — this past April, in fact — I decided enough was enough. I have a teenage daughter who needed me and being as big as I was, I was essentially a diabetic heart attack waiting to happen. I put myself on a new food plan, built a small home gym, and got to work. Since then I've lost a bit over 80 lbs and I'm back down to my fighting weight.

I'm athletic but never trained to be an athlete, so I never got into a cardio or weight training regimen. Zero experience actually taking care of my body. Never really had to, but over the years I've been making small but consistent lifestyle changes starting with my diet and now I'm 8 weeks into a real weight training program.\n\nMy motivation comes from many places. First and foremost I am happily married and I'd like to love as long as possible with my best friend. Multiple generations of men in my family have died or nearly died of heart attacks at young ages, and the common denominator was an unhealthy diet and alcohol. Fixed that. I also want my wife to not just be attracted to me but for me to become irresistible to her. \n\nI have little kids and I want to be a part of their active lives, playing sports or hiking or biking or whatever. I tell them I'm getting stronger so that I can continue to pick them up and carry them or put them on my shoulders. The oldest is 60lbs so it's not getting any easier. I also want the chance to be an active grandfather should I be so lucky. I look at our collective parents and their 2nd wives/husbands and even in their early-mid 60s they can't keep up with these kids for long. It's kinda sad.\n\nLastly it's for selfish reasons. For one, I want to know what my body is capable of and what kind of physique I can naturally attain. I want to look back at a picture of myself and say that I did it, pinpointing the period of time when I was truly in the best shape of my life. It's also a huge confidence booster AND it can help in business. It's really amazing that fit men seem to enjoy a psychological advantage of appearing mentally tough, aggressive, assertive, and successful. Finally I like the thought of other women finding me attractive, catching them checking me out (if that ever happens). For a little ego boost every now and then.\n\nIt's been a challenge for sure and I've had to forgive myself the mistakes and laziness that can set in. I just pick myself up and try to do better each day. Set a baseline for lifting that I can achieve and slowly build on it. This is a years long and life long process. As soon as I accepted that and slowed down I became more consistent and that has made all the difference. \n\nGood luck to everyone out there. Keep trying. It's hard but you can do it.",

            "text": "[24M] I've been working out for about 12 years pretty consistent in retrospect. At first, it was abs. I took a bunch of shirtless pics in junior high and all the girls I sent them to would laugh. I started doing crunches. Then I started drinking ensure. It tasted like brown colored chalk. There was something about it that I loved. However, my consistency failed me. I wasn't seeing results anymore. I took a break. \n\nThen it was wrestling. My dad was very strong and animated when he got mad and I wanted to defend myself in case things got out of hand. I bought my first mass gainer and weight set and started working out to scooby1964 when he was the only fitness youtube channel. I bulked tf right up. Put on maybe 15 pounds in 2 months. I got lots of attention from girls and respect from guys. I started to feel like a badass. Plus it felt good being able to throw other wrestlers around who have been at it for a while. But I soon got a job and now I pay for my living. Which means food. I couldn't afford anything. My consistency failed me again and I took a break. \n\nGot a better job. Could afford food again. Earned my personal training certificate. Got a job at LA Fitness. They treated me horribly. Abused me for my kindness and innocence. My environment failed me. I took another break. \n\nMy last git up was with my ex girlfriend. Now I'm chubby and pushing 180lbs. For my height, that's pretty.. puffy. I looked like jet puffed from ghost busters. I kept telling my girl \"wait until you see me when I lift\" she had this \"oh alright.\" Attitude. I discovered a new youtube channel that actually showed me step by step HOW I can achieve my dream physique, what to eat, and that.. I've been doing a majority of what I've been doing correctly, just not hard and calculated enough. I started running stairs and doing cardio. I can afford to eat whatever I want. I have a babe to look at at the gym. And I started seeing results. I was succeeding.\n\nMy girl didn't take the gym serious. She preferred to sing. Her singing drove me batshit crazy. Ended up going to the mental hospital. Still lifted. Came out and had to deal and listen to her trauma. Still lifted. She gave me PTSD from role playing one of her traumatic events during sexy time. I couldn't think about my nuts for months. Still lifted. We broke up... she shaved her head.. I quit my job.. I had to move out... I was eating beef jerky and cereal.... STILL. LIFTED. \n\nNow I got high off of lifting. It's a drug. At this point I'm dependent on lifting. It's the one thing that keeps me going, because it kept me going during my darkest times. It keeps me going strong in impossible situations. It makes me think sharper, more empathetic and I built my character by challenging myself. It's no longer a matter of \"how hard are you gonna train\". It's now asking myself \n\n\"Who are you doing this for?\"\n\nMe. \n\n\"Why are you lifting?\"\n\nSo I can be strong when I need to.\n\n\"Why does it matter?\"\n\nI live my life on MY terms. \n\n\"You're never going to be the best.\"\n\nWatch me. \n\nThen I deadlift 385 for 10 reps at 160lbs natural. \nThen I benchpress 230 for 10 reps at 160lbs natural\nAnd then I squat 335 for 10 reps at 160lbs natural. \n\nAnd then the next week I do more. I push harder. I go further. And further. And eventually I'll reach my goals. And if I know my mind is congruent with my body, I have proof that I'm reaching my goals outside of the gym. \n\nThis is why I lift.",

Around my birthday I remember looking in the mirror and just being sad at how big I was. So I decided that I was going to change it. I started working out and I was until a few weeks ago working out for an hour to an hour and a half seven days a week. I do cardio, 10km, on my bike every day and Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays I do arms/upper body (Im trying to find a good effective core workout currently) I take off Sundays now to try to reduce stress on my joints. \n\nWhile I've had internal issues since hitting my plateau, I started at 360 pounds and Im now down to around 240-250. What motivates me is looking at those old pictures of myself, I was huge and I vowed I'll never be that big again. My current goal is 225. \n\nAll the advice I can give is to find a workout that works for you, It doesn't matter if you walk for 20 minutes or jogging for 45. Just do SOMETHING and stick to it. It takes about a full month for it to become a habit and from there, you build that into a sustainable and good exercise.

I was 257 pounds and depressed and drinking every day to help that depression. However only a few weeks later my grandmother gave me that same picture in a scrapbook that she gives me every year with the all that's years photos that she's taken. That was the first time I saw the picture that changed my life because it made me think back to the way I used to think whenever I was a child. In that very moment a switch flicked in my brain. Since that day I've lost 87 pounds and feel incredible. No drinking of alcohol, sodas, no fatty foods and much much more. Getting healthy is a simply a decision and I had decided in that moment that I was not okay with what was staring back at me. Eating better foods with small portions and working out regularly are the only way to do it. Don't fall for ANY other weight loss program because they're only marketing or not sustainable for long term.

I bought a peloton and a bowflex, plus some weights and a pull-up bar, and what it came down to was getting cardio healthy on the peloton first and then going to keto, which led me to doing p90x everyday and watching what I eat.\n\nPart of that is technology where I have apps that I can literally scan a barcode and add the nutritional values up. Websites out there exist to provide you with a path to lose weight and the macros you should try to hit\n\nI lacked discipline so I went on a meal plan and don't keep much in the house outside of the diet to prevent cheating and when I do decide to doordash, I get something that's in line with my diet (can still order a mean Chipotle bowl)\n\nThe results? 20 lbs in 2 months at a steady rate that I can see and everyone else can see\n\nI'll switch over to atkins once I hit my goal, but after 8 years of just slowing building up this unhealthy \"debt,\" I feel like I'll finally find envy in my story like when I come here and read about other successes",

Off of that, I fell in love with powerlifting and that is pretty much where my focus lies. In essence, I lift to be a good bench presser because I love benching, benching has helped me lose weight, gain confidence, helped seriously treat my depression, helped with my schoolwork, and has overall changed me into a better person. I get a decent amount of compliments on my physique from people saying I look big or I am strong and I honestly don't care about them because I stopped lifting for others and instead just lifted for myself. My goal in life now is to start setting records on the bench press in powerlifting, I don't care if I have to be natural or not, I just have my singular love in the gym.  It may be obsessive, but it is what I really enjoy, that and a good pump.",

It turned into 4, then 5, then 5-6, and then into an active lifestyle that really enjoys the mental benefits. I started a few years ago calories counting and eating healthy. \n\nI used to work out with my best friends. It helped at first and then I realized I really enjoyed working out hard in isolation to think. I compete against myself, change it up regularly, and genuinely love it. \n\nI still miss eating junk food regularly (like every night). That has never got easier, ever.",

If I’m being honest with myself, I started working out initially to spite her. However working out also gave me the added benefit of increased self-confidence, increase self-esteem, and an ability to admittedly attract more attractive women. It’s been probably more than five years now, and working out has provided me with not just psychological benefits, but obvious physical benefits. I find myself working out not to impress anyone anymore, but rather to reap those benefits exponentially.

I like identifying weak areas on my body and doing exercises to target them and the next day be sore. I guess it's kinda of a reassurance knowing that what I did challenge me and had an impact and I'll heal up and be stronger the next time to do more. Working out is an escape from the world and you have tons of these small successes that overtime when you look back you've seen how far you've come. \n\nA lot of people think working out and either two ideas: looks and health which implies losing weight and gaining a better physique. Both are admirable welcomed but I like the vigor and capabilities I gain from working out. Like for example, I tried out acro yoga tonight. Ive done yoga regularly, I've dong rock climbing, running, swimming, biking, ju jitsu, gymnastics, but nothing quite like acro yoga. Spent a couple hours having body tested in new ways, supporting people, learning new things. It's all a blast. This is the fun I'm talking about. \n\nA lot of people get into working out for the wrong reasons. It's the journey that brings the happiness. If you're thinking about getting to X weight or Y physique then as soon as you get there you'll regress backward because there's nothing more to move you forward. Me, I'm always looking for new things to do. New ways to train and test myself. Could be diets, movements, weights, endurance, strength, flexibility. There's sooooo much out there. It's not a quantum leap to of \"60 days and lose 20 pounds\" or whatever. There's no shortcuts because there shouldn't be. The journey is the fun part. Focus on that and you'll stay motivated.",

They might go to he gym but they're afraid to break a sweat. They walk slowly rather than run in the treadmill. They do light weights only without eve trying to see what their own abilities actually are. They focus on how little can I do not how much can I do. They are avoidant of effort and that just doesn't work. You've got to see what you're really made of what your limits are. Effort is necessary. But the energy you give it comes back to you 4 times over. But only over a certain threshold. \n\nDo cardio every 4 or 5 days a week for 3 months without fail. And you'll be convinced of its value.

I made more of a concious effort to eat more, made sure I ate all 3 meals in a day (Prior to this, I'd often skip at least 1). Starting out at 5'2 and 90 lbs, I didn't exceed 100 lbs till the start of my junior year. Then, during senior year, when I was at the bare minimum BMI for a healthy weight (5'7 115 lbs), I got the flu, which fucked my appetite over and made me lose 5 lbs, which at the time was a major setback for me. It was then I decided to start lifting weights.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I learned when I first starting working out is that it did wonders for my appetite. I always had a small appetite but whenever I finished a workout I would be very hungry, and that helped me regain the weight I lost to the flu, and more. In addition to regular weight lifting, I began to also go on runs and bike somewhat regularly (assuming the weather was somewhat decent for it. I never liked going more than a month without doing those activities).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJanuary of 2022 will mark the 5 year anniversary of me starting to workout.

Trained with him 1-2 per week and additional in my own. I really looked forward to my time with him, I paid him for his expertise and guidance and focus on me but we had great conversations and some fun.   I was sore almost every day for the first 6 months but it got easier and now I’m 90 lbs lighter and a lot happier. He’s getting married soon and really happen for him and his fiancé!",

The idea of staying healthy in an unhealthy society gave me great satisfaction (although I always did my best to stray away from sanctimonious values which many \"healthy\" people fall into)\nThe fact I seen myself regress out of type 2 diabetes, depression was awesome (and out of medication in my teen years) \nI always felt I went against all my peers determination/ subconscious hopes for me. For ex. The ridicule I got from all my friends and family members when I decided to \"eat healthy\" was severe. Yet only strengthened my decision for going \"for going for it and to finally get healthy: thanks Tony Horton and others when I was 18)\n\nAfter I overcame the obsticles in my lifementioned above, all of this (my fitness journey) opened my mind up (awareness) to the deceptive fullness of commercialism and the manipulation of information to sell people things (never felt a conspiracy vibe with this so much as I did understanding food and health with regards to what works for being healthy) \n\nIt helped my mind to balance my emotions, I feel physically better in my mind, like there is a physical change. Therefore staying fit has helped me to think more stable and clearer. I've always felt it lifted me to a higher plane, in a healthy way. \n\nHealth and fitness for me also helped me to break away from unhealthy family tradition (had nurses for ex. in my family that told me diabetes was purely genetic, yet all they did was eat unhealthy food and hotdogs at family gatherings) I'm more convinced unhealthy traits were carried down in my family rather than unhealthy genetic genes that were deterministic.... Never seen anyone of them examine a heathly life style, yet always blamed genetics out of what I feel was... laziness and excuse for Unhealthy conditions)\n\nIt also Helped me to think strategically about other parts of life (business, sex, anything really) \nPrinciples of discipline and healthy motivation spread its way throughout all areas of my life.\n\nThe difference it made I feel is hard to convey unless you too have experienced it, however it's also hard to say that without the impression of putting other people down, which I despise. \n\nSo for me it truly did change my life for the better. That's why I focus on staying fit and working out. It even has benefits which I myself feel are unfair. For ex. The amount of respect I got after I was fit was tremendous co pared to being unfit. I don't agree with that, but rather I like it or not, it changed my life and opened doors to which otherwise would have never been opened. Yup",

But for the past 4 years, I’m a gym regular.\n\n\nI realized, most people feel this way. Don’t let them lie about “motivation” because that motivation come and goes. It’s about your **Drive**, it’s the fact that you constantly remind yourself to go to the gym. You constantly remind yourself that 3 minutes of mouth pleasure is not worth the extra 15-20lbs. That sugar should not be in a drink. That eating well and exercising does make you feel better, think faster, and motivates you towards your ultimate goal of being the best you. Exercise is my motivation and I dread stepping into the gym but boy do I enjoy leaving! Such a great feeling!\n\n\n**DONT LET ME GET BURIED! This is for the obese lazy people who never thought they could work out! I’m you! I did it after 35 years old. I never worked out as a kid, teen, or adult!

I personally just don't want to go back to my lesser self in terms of confidence, fitness, and mental state. \n\nI see that for other people as well, being there for your family and friends is a great motivator. Dads that want to be alive and take care of their family. Mothers who want to be an example to their child. Men who want to be able to protect themselves and others (Terry Crews). \n\nWhen you find a good reason, you won't need motivation.

            "text": "Have I got a story for you.\n\nSeveral years ago I was dating a girl and we were headed on the fast track to marriage, she had even indicated that she was ready for me to propose. I wasn't too far off from doing so, just wanted another month or two to make sure we were both ready for it. Then one day, completely out of the blue, she ended the relationship. She listed off a few reasons, none of which she had ever previously communicated to me or set any expectations for; they came completely out of nowhere. One of the reasons she gave: She wanted a partner who led an \"active and healthy\" lifestyle. She swam, biked, and played a few extracurricular sports with work teams and wanted her partner to be someone who was fit. Now, mind you, I was a healthy weight and was not completely out of shape, I just didn't do a lot of physical activities. And thus, what was almost a marriage was over in the blink of an eye and tore my world apart.\n\nOnce I recovered to the point of being functional again, my brain did what it usually does: Try to logic my way through this problem. There was an upcoming big local running event that I was certain she was going to sign up for, and I decided that I would run the 10K portion. She would see me there, be impressed by my speed and dedication, and that would win her back. Well, I trained hard, did great in the race, but she wasn't there and it made no difference. Then I joined a local running club and started training for half marathons. Made a lot of new friends, got motivated to run fast, and did a whole bunch of races in a year just knowing that word would get back to that girl and I'd win her back. Well, word did get back to her and she even saw me at a few of the races... and it made no difference. However, I really enjoyed my club and new friends, so I kept running.\n\nThen my brain switched logic on me again: The reason why I wasn't winning her back wasn't because I wasn't active, it's because I wasn't \"manly looking\". As in, I was lean and had strong legs, but I still looked like a scrawny twig from the waist up. I got hit with some serious body dysmorphia; everywhere I looked I saw men who were built and muscular, and here I was a complete skinny loser. No one would want me, especially the girl. So, I hit the gym. I did research on how to work out in the gym. Talked to friends that were already experienced in the gym. I was running 3 days a week and lifting 4 days a week, all in an attempt to look \"manly\". I was making significant improvements and physically looking more balanced, but it made zero difference to the girl. \n\nI had another mental and emotional breakdown because of it, eventually recovered thanks to therapy. Kept working out and running because now these activities were now just part of my lifestyle. Finally realized that not only did I not need that girl in my life, but I didn't want her in my life (especially after I reflected on things and realized more about her true character).\n\nFast forward a bit and I had been training for another half marathon. My plan was to run the race in the spring, then use the rest of the year to see how strong I could get in the gym before doing the same race again. Then COVID hit and everything shut down, races canceled. I did what I could to stay fit without weights, even finally ran a 5K distance under 23 minutes (not an official race, but hey, I'll take it). As things started opening up again, I decided to set a concrete goal for myself: Get my powerlifting (deadlift, squat, and bench press) total to 1,000 pounds. Found a powerlifting program. Dropped running for now to specialize in powerlifting. At the beginning of this year my total was mid-700's and I'm now a little over 900. I hope to hit 1,000 by the middle of next year, after which I plan to scale down and swap my primary activity back to running.\n\nI'm now healthier, stronger, and more fit in my 40s than I have been at any other point in my life. Self confidence is high, body dysmorphia a thing of the past, and I'm just content with life. Working out is now a regular part of my life, and it helps that I set specific goals and work toward them in a dedicated and structured fashion. And that's what motivates me to work out regularly.\n\nTLDR: Girl ended an almost marriage because I wasn't \"active\" enough. Started running to win her back; it didn't work. Got body dysmorphia and started lifting weights to win her back; it didn't work. Went to therapy and got better mentally and emotionally, realized I didn't need or want the girl in my life. By then working out was just part of my life, and setting specific goals to achieve keeps driving me forward. The end.",

Slowed with the exercise a little during the winter last year but not as bad. Won’t let that happen this year.\n\nWhat I’ve noticed is that I’m a results-oriented person, not a process-oriented person. The first month or so where there’s very little visible progress for the work that’s being put in and that really sucks and can be so discouraging, but after a couple of months, my shirts started feeling looser, needed to tighten the belt a little, had to get jeans that fit a little better as they were too loose, old dress shirts that had stopped fitting began to fit again. Still much to do, but that keeps me going.\n\nI’ve found that using the terms “diet” and “exercise” have not been great, but considering this a “lifestyle change” instead has been helpful. I live a healthier, more active life than I used to. Cycling is as much a leisure activity as it is cardio. Meal prep is a cost saving measure as well as a way to consistently eat healthy.

I bought pre-workout and protein powder though, and it was like $100 or so, and I told myself that if I didn't like it by the time I ran out of them, I was going to stop. Took about a month give or take a few days before I ran out, and at that point I had noticed that I was getting stronger.\n\nI decided to keep going because I wanted to see how strong I could get by training as hard as I could every day. Within 6 months I went from a 185 bench max, 315 squat max, and 365 DL max, to 295 bench, 500 squat, and 500 DL. I didn't set those numbers as goals particularly, I just worked hard each day to get better that I was the day before.\n\nI've been a fatboi my whole life. Seeing that I was actually getting strong and starting to look better is what motivated and still motivates me to this day.",

            "text": "It started out as a way just to not be fat and socially accepted. I would often go to many functions and just be ignored or not spoken to because of my looks. But after quarantine once those same people saw me again, they began to treat me different, I received attention that I hadn't before. Now I simply workout because I'm addicted to the high I get from working out and how great I feel after. It drives my entire day if I get up at 6 and can tell my friends at school that I was hitting reps in their sleep, then when I'm sitting a boring ass class I still feel better about myself. Also, there's an ego aspect to it which I'm not a fan of, because I don't like this way of thinking for myself. But whenever I see someone that isn't as physically fit as me, and I say this hesitantly, I feel better than them. Again I don't like that this is the immediate thought that comes to mind when I see someone that isn't fit, especially since I was once there. But I feel like if you were to rank every human on Earth from 1 to 7 billion, I would rank higher than that person. And every time I workout it's to get me higher on that list. Now again I don't like this way of thinking and I want it so one day I'm competing against myself but unfortunately I don't think that way. Anyways, being fit teaches you discipline like no other, and opens the door to get other portions of your life in check, I'm currently very focused on ensuring I have a successful financial future.",
