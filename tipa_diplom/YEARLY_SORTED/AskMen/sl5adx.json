    "How does penis size really work?\nThis is going to sound completely stupid and probably even more naive but when it comes to penis size is it really all random and just the genetic lottery or is there some way men while they were younger make their penises bigger?\n\nI’m asking this cos I’m only 19 and extremely insecure about my penis size due to my ex joking telling me my penis is smaller then her new man": [

I've noticed mine increases in length and girth and sometimes shortens. Part of it is how turned on you can be by someone. That can be related to attraction. Part of it is how much you exercise your dick. Sometimes I feel like using it a lot (getting it erect a lot) helps it stay bigger. Then if you abstain for a week or so on top of that it gets even bigger. What's in your water and food could shorten your penis size (temporarily or permanently). Check out your water at EPA.gov. This is anecdotal but I feel like when I have water that has tons of contaminants it shrinks my dick. When I go back to good water (usually spring water) it goes back to normal. I feel like if I have a small amount of booze before getting a boner it is bigger (maybe the booze increases blood pressure due to dehydration and helps give a stronger erection?). That being said whiskey dick is a thing sometimes so if you get drunk you might have trouble getting up at all. I think a good diet could probably help just like good water. There are so many contaminants in food, water, and air. Many things are associated with shrinking penis size. Good sleep seems to help me too. Lastly, your ex is trying to control you. Don't let her control you! Whatever that takes, if you have to cut her out of your life completely. Godspeed.",

I've been in locker rooms all my life, been naked around a bunch of other dudes as a small guy. They were never bad about it. Hell, we'd joke around with the monsters in the room: \"*What do you feed that thing?\" \"Asian girls.\"* \n\nOne of the dudes I served with, shyest white boy ever. Absolute horsecock. Army reindeer games being what they are, we totally got that dude gaslit convinced he had to wear sweatpants (the GRAY PT ones) as the new guy as we inaugurated him to clubs and titty bars. From his first week at the unit, to when he ETSed, that dude was called Mandingo. There was one incident that stood out: at this point, its become a running gag. Mandingo got picked to drive CSM around during a FTX since he was on profile. Said CSM was a stickler for every bit of BII (equipment) being with the vehicle. On Fort Riley: if you ran out of gas in the field, that's an Article 15 (punishment) because there is no reason an operator should be so negligent. The following incident after we got fucked up for it is recalled by Mandingo: \n\nSo CSM asks PFC Mandingo, \"You got a donkey dick for this humvee?\" Being the unit mascot for manhood that Mandingo has become, he naturally assumed that CSM was fucking with him the same way we did, the senior NCO breaking the ice in the field environment: here was where we did man-shit. No, CSM was asking Mandingo if he had a fuel spout adapter: a device that you screw onto one of our fuel cans: its big and flexible. Mandingo innocently replies \"I guess I do, Sergeant Major?\" \"Do you have it or not, show me\" CSM commands him.\n\nThere we were in the field training. Just got done setting up a wire obstacle for time and then dismantling it for the next group, the platoon's settling down to eat before moving out to the next training area. We knew it was trouble when we saw that Humvee driving right at us with a purpose and skill that Mandingo did not have. Sergeant Major at the wheel, and Mandingo looking at us wide-eyed from the passenger seat. When the platoon leadership approaches him, CSM tells the LT to MARCH and wait for him at our company CP and just starts laying into our platoon sergeant and squad leaders. \"I asked this soldier for a donkey dick, and he gets out of the vehicle, opens my door, and starts pulling his cock out! Start pushing! What the fuck are you doing to my Soldiers?!\" So we are getting rolled all across Kansas at this point, and we are laughing our asses off in the process. Of course one of our smartasses was going to say something: \"Sergeant Major, he followed your lawful order!\" We spent the remainder of that afternoon being broken off physically. The platoon rotating in behind us just marched right on past that lane seeing that bullshit. As smoked as we got, we still feel like we won a fight we didn't start.",

This is my experience and it may or may not apply to you, but I have a strong feeling you can relate because I can absolutely relate to the anxiety you are feeling.\n\nJust gonna be straight up and information here.\n\nAre you a shower, or a grower? That might impact your self-esteem. A shower's penis is pretty much the same size when it is flaccid as it is when erect. A grower's penis GROWS to fully erect and is smaller flaccid than it is erect. I didn't learn the difference until I was about 19 or 20 (28 now). I am a grower and I always thought every man was a shower so I felt like my penis was just small and would never be \"average\". Really affected my physical interaction with girls as a teen and made me super self conscious. Even after having some sexual interactions (everything but intercourse) later on I still felt a misplaced sense of shame. I thought having physical interactions with girls would help, but it didn't. But even still, the girls I was with in highschool never cared or said anything and it was always fun. Even though I am a grower, my penis is still not quite average size, but I'll tell you what has totally eradicated any doubt or shame I've ever felt about my penis size...having a healthy sexual and emotional relationship with a committed partner. Let me elaborate:\n\n Once I met my wife to be (who was also my first and is the only woman I have ever slept with) in college I was still self conscious before the first time we had sex. Of course we were a little awkward and it took time to learn about each other and how to move, what the other liked or didn't like. But being with her and focusing on performing for her in the bedroom motivated me to get really good at sex, at our sex. My wife loves how I make her feel and how well I know her body. And she loves my penis. My penis is perfect for her, and her vagina is perfect for me. Quite literally, we physically fit each other very well. We have been together for almost 9 years, married for 6. We started having sex about four months after we started dating and it's been great ever since because we are committed to expressing that special love to each other. It has done wonders for my self esteem and self image, not to mention our emotional relationship as well. But it isn't even all about how well we phsyciall perform for each other during the act of sex. Our sex is also great because of how we show up for each other in other aspects of our marriage. We communicate and compromise. She tells me when I'm being a jerk and I listen. I tell her when she's being a bitch (without actually using that word) and she listens. We stay humble and call each other on our bullshit. I make sure I'm providing her the security and love she needs from me as a husband, and she makes sure she providing me the respect and phsyciall attention I need from her as my wife. Everyday we try to \"out-love\" one another. Out-loving each other is huge in any relationship. We work together in the way we do life and we work together in the way we enjoy sex. \n\nWhat I'm getting at here is when you find a genuine person whom you love and trust and are committed to, and who gives you the same, any misconception you think you know about how size=pleasure goes out the window. Despite the self-esteem killing lie we learn from porn, having a big dick has NOTHING to do with being a good lover. Being a good lover is about passion, commitment, grace, communication, and trust. And even if you aren't into the monogamous relationship thing, it's all about how you make the woman feel about herself. How special she is to you and how special you make her feel. I don't care who you are, as human beings we all want deep, genuine connection with one another. It's about delivering that authenticity, not delivering on physical size.  \n\nOne last soapbox moment...In a committed relationship it is actually about how you perform in how you act. Meaning what kind of person you are, how authentic you are to yourself as a man and how you show up for your woman. Women want a man who is real, not a narcissistic bullshitter. As long as you are being your true authentic self and stepping into your power as a warrior who gets things done, and a fiercely loving man who is able be vulnerable and emotional with his woman, you will be an excellent lover. Be that kind of man you want to be when you close your eyes and think about who you would be if you had everything you wanted and were totally at peace. That's hard to do a lot of the time because we are human and we fail. But it is a constant work, a life-long work. But work at it and a woman will be impressed at that, not at your penis size.",

I feel penis size is genetic like most physical attributes. \n\nHere's my personal opinion on penis sizes as a woman. \n\nFor me personally, it is not about size, though I have preferences. Example, I do not like a large penis. Anything 8 inches and up is too much for me as I learned through my experiences.\n\nHowever, for some woman, they prefer larger penises. And it all just depends on how their vagina is naturally formed. I have a more petite vagina, a slightly shorter canal then the average woman from what my gynecologist has told me.\n\nSome woman are born with longer or slightly wider canals than others and it's all dependant on genetics AND how well we developed in our mothers wombs. Same as the penis. Some woman are born with a malformed/deform uterus, that can play a roll into the depth and width of the vaginal canal. \n\nSo, where I'm getting at is sometimes we need more experience and connection for these kind of things. Your Ex sounds like she's being spiteful and abusive and her harsh words should be dismissed. Her karma IS coming. Because there are woman out there who enjoy smaller/average sized ones. \n\nMy first bf was 5 inches, I enjoyed it. My ex was 6 1/2 inches, enjoyed it. Another ex of mine was around 7 inches. Loved it because I was given lots of care to handle it. My current boyfriend is about 4 inches and I think it's great and it just as enjoyable as the others despite them being bigger. \n\nWhat I didn't enjoy, was hooking up with a friend who had an 8 1/2 in wang on him.\n\nYou'll find the right person who appreciates what you have 🙂",

You can increase length by crushing estrogen levels during puberty which will make you have a longer puberty (probably off the table if you're 19). Increasing/decreasing hormones can have a great impact on other stuff though, so you'd have to know what you are doing anyways.\n\nYou can also permanently increase girth by pumping under water and increase flaccid length by, for example, hanging.\nAgain there is a lot of stuff that can go wrong if you don't know what you're doing.",

I once read one, it's pretty good.\nThink it's called something like Kamasutra for 21st century lovers by Ann Hooper.\nEvery position has pros and cons explained and tells you for which kind of endowment it's good for.\nOnce you rock her world, she won't really care if you have 2.5cm (1 inch) or 25 (10) so long as you can do it again.

Here is how it can help.   \n\n\nFirst, and this sounds stupid, Manscape.  Trim or cut it down, it will look bigger.   \n\n\nSecond, don't deal with your Ex. You are pretty much an adult, learn this now and your life will be easier. IT IS NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUINESS WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK OF YOU   \n\n\nYou need to focus on you and feeling better. Thats not Selfish, its self care.   \n\n\nThird, don't talk to your Ex. Do not engage, do not acknowledge, this isn't the 17th century where you can get away with dragging her new Boo out into the street and beat him within a inch of his life for the slight vs. your honor. You GOT to take it on the chin, Smile, shrug and walk away.   \n\n\nFourth, do things that make you happy. My Man, My dude, OP you got to listen to this. If your partner is a Size Queen, she will let you know. Most of the time though Women are looking for a bit more. If your Penis Size bother you, accept that it will not get bigger and learn to pleasure your partner is other ways.   \n\n\nLike for real. I came from a conservative, southern Baptist upbringing. Sex was not something you talked about.   \n\n\nFuck that shit. Talk about sex with people. Its a GROSE, SLOPPY,SILLY thing you do with someone. Don't take it seriously. Hell, fucking ask people and they will tell you what they like.   \n\n\nBefore I start with a new partner we talk about likes and dislikes. Boundaries and Consent, even after care and such. I PROMISE you, that once you get confident enough to have these conversations without blushing and feeling silly your relationships will improve.   \n\n\nIf you want more information, I can highly advise looking through Poly resources. You don't have to be Poly to understand the importance of open communication and mutual support.   \n\n\nListen. OP, speaking as a Father. I love you, and I believe in you.

Either way, it’s a win/win situation. \n\n2.) Don’t stress over another man’s dick unless you enjoy other men’s dicks. \n\n3.) Size is great, but experience is key. An experienced marksman with a pistol is more dangerous than a newbie with an AR. \n\n4.) Confidence leads to more hookups than size. There are plenty of well hung guys who can’t get laid because they aren’t confident in themselves. \n\n5.) I’ve seen people saying to learn to be good with your fingers, and that’s true. What I find to be more important? Lear to use your tongue. A combo of talented fingers and tongue is great. \n\n6.) Use toys. Don’t be scared. Be like a mechanic under a hood. Use all the tools necessary and at hand. Hell, take her to a shop and buy her some. \n\n7.) Not all vaginas are the same, and G-spots aren’t in the same place on every one. Sometimes, a smaller/average penis with a curve can hit the spot better than other sizes. \n\n8.) This has been the biggest one that has worked in my past.

She also could just be saying that...\n\nAlso, similarly, every vagina is different. Your penis may be small in one and big in another. Every woman's vaginal cavity, tightness, etc etc is different. So you could have a big pénis and find a big vagina and think you're small. Or find a girl with a small vagina and sex becomes painful every time. \n\nIt's a whole cluster fuck of variables.

Yours is very likely perfectly normal, and that’s good enough for the majority of women. Penis size only has an effect on sex if you’re on either extreme end of the size spectrum. Too small (which is very rare, we’re talking like half a normal sized finger’s length) and you need to find other ways to do the dirty, which is perfectly okay. Sex doesn’t have rules about how it needs to be done, it’s literally just about being intimate. Too large and you need to be careful not to hurt her, and possibly have difficulties making it fit.\n\nIn every other circumstance your penis size is irrelevant to sex. Position, rhythm, what’s going on in your head, what’s going on in their head, atmosphere, your relationship, sounds you make, things you say… the list goes on, and every one of those things is more important to the experience than whether your erect penis is 4 inches or 6.\n\nDon’t stress over it.

See a big truck go by? \"Huehuehuehue tiny dick lol\" someone does something impressive? \"That dudes got some BALLS\"\n\nGUYS are the ones concerned about dick size, and GUYS think bigger=better. Your ex knows that and she's being an asshole on purpose.\n\nThat said, you know how the average dick size is 5 inches and change, more or less? And some guys have dicks as big as 8 inches, and some guys have dicks as small as 3? \n\nWell women ALSO have differently sized vaginas, same as men. I do not have an enormous schlong, I've measured and seen the averages, but I've been with a couple of women who I legit *could not fit* inside of, and that's definitely not because of my equipment. My long-term girlfriend really has to warm up before we go at it, not because I have a telephone pole, but because that's just how she's built. She would be *perfectly* happy, probably much happier actually, if I had a much smaller than average penis.\n\nAnd some women are the opposite. You hear guys that are like \"lol like a hotdog down a hallway\", or \"she's just a size queen\", and those women are just built larger down there and there's nothing wrong with that. \n\nThat said, if you're with a woman and she doesn't want to ride your dick because of discomfort, then dick size doesn't come into it at ALL since she won't be feeling it. But we still had a very fulfilling sex life because what's FAR MORE IMPORTANT than dick size is paying attention to her body and what turns her on, and that she does the same for you.\n\nSo it doesn't matter one way or the other. Individual women have individual preferences, and painting everyone with a wide brush doesn't work. Not to mention, if huge dicks WERE vastly preferable across the board then we would have been selectively bred to all have gigantic meat sticks *long* ago. \n\nAlso, sex toys are your teammates, not your competition. Don't be afraid to tag those guys in, she'll love you for it.\n\nTL;DR- dick size only really matters to guys. Give her attention in the right way and she'll be perfectly happy.

I know micros might lead to problems, but I feel like you don’t have a micro you probably are average/maybe above who knows: here’s what I DO KNOW (as a 34m who’s dated a good amount). My first girl? I was her 20th man, all were much older (I was 17 she was 18) and she damn near sent me to the hospital with scratches because I put her orgasm first and not one of those guys bothered to be a “giving lover”. Trust me I’m statistically no where NEAR the biggest one she played with. You’re not gonna believe this: but a surprisingly shocking amount of men don’t see it as their job to give them good times, if they have a good time so be it mentality. I need you to realize it’s quite possible mine was one if not the smallest she ever “had” and I rocked that “promiscuous” woman’s world. Any woman who talks about a mans penis being small is a cunt, and you should reply with “that’s great news! I felt so bad for you when I seen that hallway you call a vagina so I’m very happy for you that you’ve figured out what you actually deserve in life, hope he treats you like the queen you are!” Kind of passive aggressive yet confusing enough for them not to realize your insulting them. 1. She’s telling you to make you jealous, NO WOMAN WHO IS OVER YOU WILL DO THAT, when you’ve fucked up beyond repair you won’t get that.. you’ll be ghosted. That guy probably drives her crazy in the bad way and she’s reaching if not flat LYING because she hurts missing you and well that’s how some humans operate…. Now to sex Ed: your dicks barely the main character, great sex is typically defined by the foreplay (I’m big on always giving oral til I can’t because I’m a giver). Sex is soooo much more than penetration, and if you only penetrate they prob won’t be saying it was the best sex ever.. sex is an act of love, meaning a physical expression of pleasure.  Also vaginas don’t actually stretch like we were taught, (I’m saying this after being with multiple women who had multiple children… the guys dick ain’t 12” round, you think they vaginas looked like that? No, they looked like the girls I was used to. YOU WILL LEARN THIS, after you’ve been with more women. Ask other women if I’m wrong about this, don’t just take a randoms advice. Also bro, pick a real woman next time… that was not a real woman and she almost (I hope you realize she’s messing with your head and there isn’t a damn thing wrong with you, young coxman {lol} but SERIOUSLY). That motion in the ocean line is really true… good luck kid, pick better (NICER, and not sexually obsessed and toxic, there had to be red flags before you guys broke up).

Some guys got big dicks others got small dicks, some got fat dicks some got thin dicks, some got bendy dicks some got straight dicks, some go straight up some go straight out, some are gigantic flaccid some are tiny flaccid. Some people like huge dicks, some people like regular old dicks, and some people like dicks on the smaller side. Just like height, some people have preference and if you're on the shorter side you may have less people that are into you, but ultimately if you base your entire personality on how big/small your dick is and you let it bother you you'll have a bigger problem (easier said than done).\n\nIt feels really important when you're younger. I'm 31 now and I literally only ever think about the size of my dick when someone posts something about dick size on Reddit.\n\nIf you have a big dick, Ive heard that it's 'fun' for a little while. Getting your dick out and having a girl go 'wow' would probably feel pretty good, in the same way taking off your shirt and having a girl go 'wow' would feel good. But I have a regular sized dick and I have hurt girls with it by mistake on *many* occasions (bumping into cervix) and some girls have said they were sore afterwards. I cannot imagine how much of a bummer it would be to not be able to get your dick in without a ridiculous amount of foreplay and care and lube.\n\nPeople say hurtful things and they say things about things they know others are sensitive about. One day you will (hopefully) literally not give a fuck about the size of your dick, and know that most girls don't either.",

In my experience, most women like a slow, steady build and lots of teasing. I also have had great success buying and using vibrators with my partners and highly recommend it to everybody (it can be awkward bringing it up to a new person and does require a fair amount of intimacy prior, so make sure you pick your moment haha)",

Most women can't cum from penetration. This isn't something I'm saying to make you feel better, it's as a PSA to men in general that clitoral stimulation matters more than your dick, never mind the size of your dick. Most women need something like oral or heavy petting or toys like vibrators. \n\nYou don't need a bigger dick, no matter what it's size is...

            "text": "I am not a woman, a gay man, or a casanova so take that in mind.\n\nDoes penis size matter? It seems the answer is yes to varying degrees. Some women really care about it, a lot care about it but less. A whole lot of men think their penis is much smaller than it is and put a larger emphasis on it than there really should be.  Additionally you'll find a number of women that don't want a really big dick (yes really see /r/bigdickproblems ). Not all women want to feel stretched out, or have their cervix hit. Additionally there are women who've have sex with really smaller than average dudes and enjoy it (I know this because I too was very insecure about my size and sought out all sorts of posts like this one).\n\nThere's a lot more to hetero sex than vaginal penetration, in fact a lot of women (I believe the majority) can't orgasm from vaginal penetration alone, they require clitoral stimulation. Not to mention kissing, massaging, whatever else she might be into. You have fingers, you have a tongue, if she has toys and is open to it ask her if she wants to use a vibe on her clit while you have sex or ever better if she can show you how to use it on her. Remember lesbians don't have dicks they still manage to have fulfilling sex lives. In all likelihood your dick is average and it might even better than. If not that's ok.\n\nYour ex was being douchey. Think about it, she has a new boyfriend but is spending time talking to you about her current boyfriend's penis size. That's kinda weird right?\n\nThere are non-surgical ways to ways to MAYBE make your dick bigger but there is a risk of permanent damage like erectile dysfunction,  to your dick and I don't think there's much research behind these methods. It is better just to focus on living your life, gaining confidence in yourself, having fun, and trying to be an attentive lover (not that you aren't necessarily one now). Being happy with yourself and confident is probably a bigger factor than the size of your dick for most women. Focusing on dick size is for most men a silly unnecessary rabbit hole a lot of men go down that just wastes their time. Men care more about their dick size than most women do.",

You can affect temporary change at great cost, but it’s reversible and not worth the potential physiological damage you can incur.\n\nNow…\n\nThe size of my penis and my height never really bothered me––until I got married. We’ve been married for nine years, and that’s nine years of monogamy for both of us. We were virgins when we got married, and we were naive in matters of all things sexual. She was from a super conservative culture, and in the beginning we didn’t communicate our sexual needs well.\n\nSo we went eight years without much trying to have sex. As an adult my penis has been “average” sized for North America, and I never felt any bother about being average. But my wife…well, her equipment doesn’t match mine. The gyno has to use one of the smallest dilators when she has her exam. Even now, after pregnancy. The first time we had sex, it was painful because neither of us really understood the problem. It was so tight that it was never really pleasurable for me, either. (It would force the blood out of my penis. So no childish jokes about how I hit the “jackpot.” I didn’t. How could I enjoy myself in light of my wife’s pain?)\n\nNow imagine last year, as a man who is almost thirty years old, after not using a condom for awhile I realized: my penis has gotten wider and longer. I measured and checked my old notes and confirmed it. Not only that, I grew 3/4” taller over the year. I’m almost thirty. **What. The. Hell**. It was grief. Anguish. I didn’t want to be taller. I didn’t want to be bigger down there. It already hurt her enough. We already struggled enough. But then I started to open up to her; and she began to open up to me. We began to communicate our needs clearly. And I’ve gotta say…things have never been better!\n\nWe’ve since learned to overcome this difference with use of dilators, toys, oral sex, etc. and things are better than ever. Because friend, I love HER. I love HER, not what she can do for me or do to me. No other woman has sparked joy for me, sparked the fire in me that she has. So I’m determined to make things work. We are determined. \n\nYou deserve a partner who understands you, works with you, listens to you, who accepts you for who you are, who loves you unconditionally for *you.* ALL of you.

There are speculations flaccid size on a population level may be associated with lower latitudes as it could have some function implicated in heat dispersion but there's really nothing solid there. \n\nThere is nothing you can do to change your penis size, its ultimate size is determined by genes from both of your parents as well as hox gene integrity and fetal hormone exposure. Your penis stands perpendicular to your body (and gravity) due to an anchoring tendon. You may have this tendon surgically severed, which can add about an inch to your size, but then your dick will be pointing straight down rock hard for the rest of your life which is pretty fuckin weird tbh. Plus there's nothing an extra one inch will really do for you that technique can't.\n\nThe world is pretty short (heh) on understanding for small dicks even though by definition the majority of the male population is average or below, and women in particular are absolutely terrible at developing any kind of empathetic appreciation for the abstract interface between the penis and masculine identity, so don't expect really much of anything there. It remains a fair-game avenue for derision and you'll find plenty of people preaching body positivity from one side of their mouth and dropping small dick jokes from the other, and terms like \"big dick energy\" and \"small dick energy\" are popular shorthand for something positive and something negative. What you need to come to terms with is that, when someone tries to make you feel bad for something out of your control, it genuinely says more about them than it says about you. I'm right smack on the dot average, and I used to be really insecure about it. When I was in my mid 20s I was dating this nurse I worked with (do not make this mistake). One time, out of the blue, she goes to me, totally serious, \"y'know if we broke up I wouldn't tell anyone you have a small dick.\" I remember I burst out laughing like, yeah I fucking hope not, for your sake. Imagine for a moment you are an emotionally well-adjusted human being and your co-worker, salty about a breakup, goes to you, \"hey 7evenCircles has a small dick.\" Is your reaction, \"LMAO what a nerd\"? No, it's, \"ok why are you telling me this I literally don't give a shit and that's a pretty scummy thing to do.\" So it is for most people. Your ex is just trying to make you feel bad about yourself out of nothing but spite. It's hard to take a larger perspective because this is happening to you, it's personal.

One is hormonal disruptions, for example by chemicals like phthalates. \n\n3. There is no real way to increase the size of the penis. There are some techniques that have both some empirical and alot of anecdotal evidence that result in growth, both length and girth.

However, environmental factors can prevent this growth. Such as your hormone levels, physical activity and most importantly your diet. \n\nIf you want some advice on how this diet would look like you can read below. However, this only works when you're in development! OP is 19 now so I'm sorry but other than keeping a healthy lifestyle to prevent shrinkage there is little to do to enhance growth. \n\nMaking sure you don't over eat while growing up will definitely help. Also get enough protein combined with low fat. The amount of proteins you should take in is dependent on your body weight, about 0.8 times your weight in kg will give u the answer in gram.\nMeaning if you weigh 50 kg make sure you get around 40 grams of protein per day.\nYou should increase this if you do high intensity training to 1.2 times your weight. Would mean for 50 kg that you need 60 grams of protein.\n\nThan additionally vitamin K will help your blood density make sure your intake is adequate between 0.75 and 1 times your body weight in kg to convert to your vitamin K necessity in microgram.\n\nAdditionally walking and keeping physically active will help a lot. Running or high intensity not necessarily. What you need is blood flow in parasympathetic state, so relaxed. \n\nOther factors that can influence it are stress (try to relax), mutilation (speaks for itself), smoking (don't), alcohol (don't) and draught (just drink enough).",

Penis pumps are a thing (for that play session, not a permanent thing or to do excessively). Pussy pumps are a thing. Mix those? Fun. Add toys? Fun.\n\nThere is no way to say what will work, but there are fun alternatives to take part in, if you wish, that will change sex up.\n\nAnd again, this ex of yours is rude and may like well endowed dicks. The next girl may like the small ones. You may run into a cuckqueen that literally wants you caged all day. You may run into girls who love guys with micropenises and degrading them (they usually like it too as a kink they fall into). And then you may run across the absolutely perfect girl you get married to and she thanks all of those girls for passing you up. Boom.\n\nQuick answer? There isn’t even a long answer. Sorry, bud. Not many are bulls, and even then, not many BWC/BBC are fit to be bulls anyways. There’s so much that goes into everything!

Technique counts for the rest, as the clitoris does most of the work in creating an orgasm. Truthfully, a dick like a toilet paper roll will usually give a bigger orgasm than a long one.

This is a real chicken/egg situation though, because they may have been skinnier due to more testosterone and an easier time losing weight, whereas some may have been chubbier due to more estrogen and difficulty losing weight. Thats the only one I know about though. But vaginas and breasts are genetic too. It's fine to have a preference but anyone judging someone for something they have zero control over is stupid.",

IF there are environmental factors your best bet is good nutrition and good habits. There are methods to increase penile length but the risks simply aren’t worth it and there is both length and girth to contend with. Girth would require implants and length would require breaking, stretching, healing. Similar to lengthening bones. These things could render you completely unusable and/or eliminate all pleasure. Do NOT consider it.\n\nThe best thing you can do is be confident and work with what you’ve got. Practice. Be open minded. If you lack stamina, work on stamina or assistance practices such as fingers, mouth, toys. If you’re not girthy or lengthy enough, try positions that help or change up your stroke for rhythm and touch points. \n\nAlso, straight up communicate.  Some women will think you are large, some will think you are small, some will be dead fish, and some will be very active in both your pleasure. Sex is fun, sex is funny, sex is communication, talent, and technique. Most of all, good sex can be worked on and does not require you to have a humongous dong. If it did there would be no lesbians or little penises as selection would have worked those out of the gene pool.\n\nGood luck out there, and never send unprompted dick pics.",
