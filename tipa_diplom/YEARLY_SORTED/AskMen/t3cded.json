    "What do men think of the new(ish) trend of women ditching the hair dye and growing out their silver/grey hair? Since many people (men and women) start going grey in their 20's/30's, is it good that society is starting to normalise this? Would you encourage/support your partner in doing this?\nWow. I did not expect this post to get so big! It's been really interesting to see everyone's opinions so thanks for chipping in. \n\nI'm completely grey myself (in my 40's) and I love my hair, as does my husband, but I had a woman tell me on social media (yes, yes, I know . . . social media is a snake pit!) that I've completely let myself go because I stopped using dye. That annoyed me and I was curious about the general opinion on the topic, hence this post.": [

So he buys black cow dye (I have no idea why they sell cow dye) and dyes her mane, tail, legs and some points (where things connect, withers, haunches, kind of just touch up spots, it's hard to explain, but it makes it look natural) every summer before show season.\n\nIt's fuxking hilarious. We didn't notice it at first and then wondered what the hell happened to Spinner. Then we found the dye and he admitted it and we watched Spin get lighter as summer went on.

Its pretty when it's natural and long and curly with greys running through the black. It's pretty when it's short and it's pretty when it's dyed different colours. From the pictures I've seen she was still a stunner when it was basically shaved off, she's gorgeous no matter what she does with it. She's always had a really healthy attitude to age changing her body so I wouldn't feel the need to give her some spiel about how natural is better if she wanted to dye it again, I know she'd just be doing it for fun.

It wasn't that I don't appreciate it in general, it was just that I guess I knew once I let it go I'd have decades of my life to be gray and I just wanted to enjoy experimenting with colors for a little longer. Then it just got too tedious touching up my roots every 2-3 weeks. I also got telogen effluvium due to stress from the past few years and although that's temporary it just felt wise to stop dumping chemicals into my hair.. So I made the leap. Not only is my hair growing back but I'm LOVING the gray. I was platinum as a kid and then it became kind of a boring ash brown.

Nevertheless, it must be said that you’re only making wealthy people wealthier by using dye to negate rather than complement nature. A friend of mine who practices Buddhism very seriously told me once that her guru chastised her quite sharply for being such an avid student of the intellectual aspects of Buddhism while almost entirely negating the teachings by being a woman of a certain age who dies her hair.
