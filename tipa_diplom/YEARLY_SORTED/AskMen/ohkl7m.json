            "text": "the bardbarian\n\nHELLO! And welcome to the newest form of awesomeness that your mind HAS EVER ENCOUNTERED BEFORE!!!\n\nThat's right... I'm about to blow your mind so much it'll have a cigarette and call me in the morning. We're talking about a smooth-talking, trash-talking, pile of rage and muscles that uses his skills and prowess to put the hurt on his enemies, without dealing a single point of damage!\n\nYes, my swift-minded friends, we're building a Pro-wrestler!\n\nThere's one important thing you need to understand about 5e D&D -- Athletics is a combat skill. You see, if you look close enough, you'll find Grapple right under the Attack action section in the PHB. This wonderful little action utilizes the Athletics skill to impose problems on your enemies and that's what we're going to focus on here.\n\nGrapple is a contested skill check of Athletics (Str) versus Athletics (Str) or Acrobatics (Dex). If the target fails, we impose 0 move speed on to the target - Note: We are not ourselves also Grappled, they would have to succeed on their own Grapple check, separate from this check. We can move at half speed, taking the Grappled target along with us with no additional check.\n\nNow, that's all well and good. But we need to succeed on an Atheltics check first. Consider a level 6 character. We've taken 3 levels of Barbarian and 3 levels of Bard - This gives us a Proficiency of +3. We've got a Str of 17 (15 +2 racial) for a +3 modifier. \n\nNow, with Bard we've got a juicy little class feature called Expertise. This lets us double our proficiency on any two skills. We will, of course, be picking Athletics. This is an additional +3 bonus.\n\nIf you're playing along at home, you've must've concluded that we're sitting at a cozy +9 bonus for Atheltics. But you're not quite there all the way. You see, we're a smack-talking, trash-dishing Pro-Wrestler, remember? We use Lore Bard's Cutting Words to impose a -1d6 on an enemy's Attack Roll, *Ability Check*, or Damage Roll. Guess what just happens to be  an *Ability Check*?\n\nYep. Athletics. -1d6 averages out to -3 to the enemy's check, which is equivalent to +3 to our check. So we'll count it as such. So, +12... Seems pretty good, right? FOR A PANSY WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO REACH OUT AND HOLD SOMEONE! We're not even done, Son!\n\nBarbarian, the joyous pile of meat frothing at the mouth with the fury of a thousand suns. When raging, they get Advantage on Strength based ability checks. Did we forget what was an ability check? It's Athletics! You get Advantage on Athletics while raging. Now, people far smarter than me have figured out that Advantage roughly equals a +3 bonus on the die, which is fine. I like people that are smarter than me and I like +3 bonuses. So we're taking it as what it is, roughly +3.\n\nThis means you have *roughly* +15 to your Athletics check, if and when you need to Rage and/or use Cutting Words. PLUS FIFTEEN.\n\nOne. Five. 15.\n\nDo you know what the Athletics check of a Balor is? The CR 18 Demon Lord of The Pits of Hell? Fire Whip and Giant Sword? You shall not pass and all that. That guy? \n\nHis Athletics Check is +8.\n\nYou almost double his Athletics check. You beat his check more often than not, and you're 12 Levels lower than his CR. Four level 18 characters should take him on, and you get to just reach out and grab him.\n\nYou will one hundred percent die *immediately* afterwards, but for one brief, wondrous moment you will have a **VERY** confused Demon in your hands.\n\n-----\nSo, that's all well and good. You get to grab people and pick them up and carry them off.. What good is that?\n\nYou see, when enemies aren't near your friends, they aren't stabbing your friends. You've just controlled the battleground with a skill check. Vicious enemy kills friend in one hit, vicious enemy never gets to get close to friend to administer said one hit. Easy, breezy, beautiful, Cover Bugbear.\n\nBut wait. Vicious enemy can still attack YOU. Barbarian 3 gives you Resistance to ALL damage (except Psychic) while Raging. This effectively doubles your Health Point pool, which is nice already since Barbarian. But that's not all...\n\nOh no, I'm never just done and it's never just all there is! You see, we've got other options to our combat control. The Grappled enemy is struggling, stabbing at things wildly, and generally being a nuisance to us. So we tip them over!\n\nThat's right. We're going to reuse the Athletics check by using it with the Shove Action. Look under Grapple and you'll find our next wonderful combat trick.\n\nShoving an enemy imposes the Prone condition. The Prone condition imposes Disadvantage on all outgoing attacks and grants Advantage to all incoming attacks made from 5ft away. The target can remove the condition by standing up - done by spending half it's movement.\n\nBUT WAIT JUST A MOMENT YOU FIESTY LITTLE GOBLINOIDS! The target has no move speed because Grappled takes it all away! This means your new found friend literally can not stand up. They are prone from now until you decide to let them go or they beat you in an Athletics (or Acrobatics v. Athletics) check.\n\nSo your new friend is Prone, Grappled, Attacking at Disadvantage, and being attacked at Advantage. What do you do now?\n\nGO GET ANOTHER FRIEND! You only Grapple with one hand! That means you can control two enemies at once, remove them from combat completely and make any of their attacks against you almost meaningless... Attacking at Disadvantage, against a decent AC, Full Resistance, and a High Health Pool? Sure, go ahead and swing that dagger - it tickles.\n\nNow you've got two friends in hand! What do? Well... You've got options. You can take your new friends and walk towards the nearest cliff. Or you can tell them to fight each other and that you'll let the winner go. See if they'll go in on that... Like a pair of Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots. Or, you could just walk them over to your Rogue. Show him or her where to cut. I'm sure they'd love to unwrap the present you got them.\n\n\"But Desdomen!\" you say, \"How are you carrying all this?!\" Questions, you're full of them... Instead of Gummy Bears...\n\nLet's talk stats. 17 Strength from before, remember? That gives us a Carry Capacity of 255. Except, we're a race that gets a +2 Strength... Let's run down the list:\n\n*Bugbear*, Dragonborn, Mountain Dwarf, *Goliath*, Half-Orc, *Orc*, Tortle\n\nNotice how I've highlighted classes that get Powerful Build?  Treats you as a Large Creature, effectively doubling how much you can carry. 255 becomes 510. That's a lot of carry capacity, and that gives us normal movement, which is half-speed while grappling someone.\n\nBut, we can take it a step further. Push/Pull/Lift is actually double your Carry Capacity. 510 becomes 1020.\n\nDid you know an Adult Grizzly weighs about 800lbs? Imagine being able to pick up an adult grizzly bear.\n\nNow imagine being a level 6 Barbarian, taking Aspect of the Bear and Doubling your Carrying Capacity. Please note that this does not grant Powerful Build. This is a **completely different bonus**...\n\n1020 becomes 2040. Imagine being able to pick up two adult grizzly bears and making them kiss...\n\nOr don't take a Powerful Build class... It's not wholly needed. You do you, boo. Just be sure to take the +2 Str.\n\nStat wise, you want Strength as high as possible. Constitution is important as it builds HP and AC from Barbarian. Dexterity is nice for AC, so that should be thought about. You'll need Charisma of 13 to multiclass, past that it's useless for you. Intelligence and Wisdom are dump-stats for pure combat, but don't be dumb.\n\nNow, stats out the way, you need class build, right?\n\nBarbarian 1 gives you a lot of hit points and Bard is better Multiclassed.\n\nBard 1, 2, 3 is next, since you want to get to Expertise as quick as possible.\n\nFrom there, Barbarian 2, 3 get you to Resist All on Rage.\n\nBarbarian 4, 5 gives you your Feat and Extra Attack, which is huge for you since you can now Grapple and Shove in one round. From here, you have some options.\n\nBarbarian 6 gives you the extra weight, which is handy but not wholly needed. More quality of life so you never need to calculate encumbrance again. Going further in Barbarian makes your Rage even better and makes you nigh-unkillable, which is a significantly choice build option.\n\nBard 5 gives you a d8 for your Cutting Words and gives you your Cutting Words back on Short Rest instead of Long. Definitely lets you use them more often to secure the grapples when needed. Going further in Bard gives you amazing utility using spells, not only from the Bard list but from any list with Magical Secrets. You're not quite as resistant as a Barbarian focused Wrestler, but you bring the utility outside of combat \n\n-----\n\nOkay, Feats!\n\nThere's two relevant feats, and I use that term loosely.\n\n1) Grappler. Grappler seems relevant because it says \"Grapple\". It is not relevant. It sucks. What benefit it gives, we can gain better with equal action economy and NOT imposing problems on ourself. If your DM is nice, he'll tack on a \"Can grapple Enemes of Size two larger\" to it, as it was meant to be.\n\n2) Tavern Brawler. Tavern Brawler seems relevant because it lets us Grapple off of an attack with an improvised weapon. It's not relevant for that reason. Attacking is bad - Skills. Tavern Brawler is relevant for a whole different reason. Improvised Weapon usage can be a wonderfully fun thing. You know what a dead goblin is sorta-kinda like? A club. Right? 1d6 weapon right there, right?\n\nYou know what is sorta-kinda like a dead goblin? A live goblin. \n\nYes, my friend. If your DM is willing, Tavern Brawler gives you proficiency with your enemies, literally. Because you need to beat a motherfucker with another motherfucker.\n\n-----\n\nYou've got your build, you've got your combat style, you've got your awesomeness in a fanny pack. You get to be a top-rope jumping, trash-talking, hype-machine of a wrestler. All you need is some snazzy tights and you even get to play your own intro music!\n\n~/u/desdomen",

You can play a Gloomstalker and attack in the middle of the night, invisible to your enemies as you occasionally take out the light, maybe with a helpful Sorcerer who has Control Flames to snuff a torch, and if you need to hide all your friends, you automatically get Rope Trick when you get a second level spell slot. Having a Beast Companion is useful with some coordination of how you're using your companion, allowing for shenanigans, ambush opportunities, or even just some brute force in combat.\n\nRogues have a few primary directions to go, from dealing devastating damage to enemies to just utilizing their skills for things like picking locks, cracking safes, lying their asses off to enemies, or the inverse of that, using detective skills to dig through everything and find information or clues the group desperately needs.",

            "text": "One of my favorite multi-classes I did in a one-shot a friend ran was a Barbarian-Druid. \n\n1. Take at least 3 levels of barbarian to get Path of the Totem Warrior. Take the Bear spirit when you get to choose your first totem spirit ability at Barbarian level 3 which gives resistance to all non-psychic damage when raging.\n\n2. When picking Druid, at Druid level 2 pick Circle of the Moon for your subclass. This increases the strength of the creature you can Wild Shape into. From level 6 and on, you can Wild Shape into a creature with a Challenge Rating equal to 1/3 your Druid level. This means at Druid level 6, you can transform into a Polar bear. This **ALSO** allows you to Wild Shape as a bonus action.\n\nThis is where the real fun begins. At total level 9 -- Barbarian 3/Druid 6 -- you can use your action to Rage, then use your bonus action to Wild Shape into a CR 2 polar bear. A CR 2 polar bear has an AC of 12, 42 HP, 40ft of movement on land, and a multi-attack with a +7 to-hit bonus on each of its two attacks.\n\nWhile raging as a 3rd-level Barbarian, you get +2 damage to each hit, and you take half damage from basically everything. So, you basically have 84 HP as a polar bear. Further, you can also use reckless attacks so that ***all of your attacks on your turn have advantage***, though with the caveat that enemies have advantage to hit you as well.\n\nAlso, some Druid spells can be used to buff you before you enter Wild Shape. While raging, you can't concentrate on spells, *but* some spells give a buff without concentration. For example, Longstrider increases your movement speed by 10ft. for 1 hour, so casting that on your first turn in combat, then next turn raging and Wild Shaping into a polar bear, and now you're a polar bear with 50 ft. of movement, pretty easily outrunning most enemies. However, this could be improved if you have an ally casting a spell on you to buff you, such as with Barkskin, Dragon's Breath, or other types of spells. I am unaware of any spells that improve the damage output of natural weapons, come to think of it, whereas I know Pathfinder has some in that realm.",

I also have realized I really don't like playing a warlock, I like to be able to dive full on into a roll, and a ranger being mostly a striker while still having some magic doesn't really work as well for me and a warlock having very limited spell casting doesn't work for me either.\n\nI've had fun playing a rogue, it's always great to go stealthy as long as your party can actually use that in the story.\n\nMy absolute favorite has been a cleric, more specifically a forge cleric. I was the absolute epitome of a tank in our party, I got to play the grumpy dwarf who absolutely loved being a blacksmith. Even had a storyline where because he was a cleric of the forge he was blessed with a son made of metal which wound up being a war forged player character in our party who played as a barbarian. And I got to use my best kratos voice to constantly call him \"boy\" referring to him as my son.  I thought about healing last, and would usually use healing word when someone would go down just shouting \"get up and show some real strength\" or \"Don't be pathetic\" or whatever grumpy old dwarf thing I could think of.\n\nMy main focus was get right in the middle of combat, get my spirit guardians up, along with my spiritual weapon, and get ready to take the hits. What made it more interesting, was that I could attack with my spiritual weapon as my bonus action, and if I was truly surrounded I could just take the Dodge action as my main action. That plus my insanely high AC meant I was almost impossible to hit, however if I came up against a caster who went for one of my weak spots, shit got real.  We went up against a bunch of clerics from a cult at one point, and I had very low dexterity, I wound up right in the middle and failed a whole bunch of sacred flame attacks, and went down in one round. And everybody got really worried really quickly, realizing that the one guy who was always the intense tank just went down in one round.  It made things very fun and very interesting.\n\nI just realized I really like focusing on being a full caster or a full martial character of some kind, Even when I have played a monk that at least allows me to do the most fun kind of flavor Kung Fu stuff I can think of. But the pure versatility of a full caster, especially one who can be on the front lines and really dealing with the crazy stuff, that is the absolute most fun I've had. Because standing back and casting his cool and powerful, but the danger of being on the front line mixed with the versatility of a full caster has been the best.\n\nI am excited for my next character though, I plan to play a smash and grab barbarian/rogue who in no way understands how to go stealthy but just bashes in dual wielding short swords.  And he just assumes that's how thieving is usually done, planning to go divine barbarian blessed by mask the god of rogues up until about level 5, and then just going the rest rogue thief.",

Ranger is an okay class, but thanks to Tasha’s it’s gotten better, especially due to the Canny ability (2 bonus languages and an expertise). Gloom Stalker is really fun to me because it gives you a lot of things you are hard to get otherwise. You can add a second ability modifier to your initiative which is really good (especially with assassin rogue). Additionally, it gives 60 feet of Darkvision or adds 30 feet if you already have it. This lets any character get darkvision, removing what is arguably Variant Human’s biggest weakness. Also, the extra darkvision is really good because getting beyond 60 feet of darkvision is hard to get in my experience. Also, being invisible while in darkness is so good. I’m currently playing a Fighter/Rogue/Ranger multiclass and in so many encounters I’m basically unkillable if we fight at night just because of this feature. Additionally, a bonus saving throw proficiency (in Wisdom, one of the most useful saves) is always good and Stalker’s Fury is pretty good. To me, the subclass seems to disappoint a bit after level 3, which is why I love it as a multiclasser. I get 3 levels of it, swap to another class, and continue the rest of my build.",

I like the idea and lore of Paladins and I think the whole power from a deity and keeping a lawful good alignment to keep your powers sounds cool, but I wonder if it makes it a pain in the ass to play with others in a party? I mean if you are really playing to your alignment, how could you have a rogue in your party that does evil things? Wouldn’t a Paladin be absolutely compelled to smite his evil ass or else risk losing favor with his deity and this is power?",

So idk. I did take a level into Paladin last week which will probably be Oath of the Crown, pledging to that same diety that gave me Flametongue. I'm going Smite ups my dps but we'll see. I was thinking Oath of Vengeance but I'm pretty sure the DM has some story ideas, and after I pledged to the diety the rest of my group did so also, in their own druid and necromancer kind of ways. Anyway for a first campaign, it's been extremely exciting, for the first few months each week was better than the last, and we have an awesome DM so I can't complain. I just can't wait for the campaign to go further. I'd even start a new one as I have the time and I'm working on a new character.

Burning Wheel another one.\n\nThe rules of the game create the play experience people are going to have. D&D can be really broad or narrow and give many different experiences. Classes are great but they're also constraining and force you to play a specific way for a long time and hugely punish you for trying to do different things than your class intended.\n\nCompare this with like the Fate system, which is far more built to encourage cool moments. You can be good at things, but you can also find ways to do things beyond that and have powerful moments.\n\nLook at Fiasco, a 'game/system' that's about things going wrong.\n\nThere are tons of systems out there. Play different ones.\n\nI'm a game designer and wasn't happy with what I was finding, so I built my own. Been running it three years and love many parts of it.\n\n./end rant\n\nThread answer: I think Clerics are the most flexible class for doing different things.

Although their pool of total spells known is much more limited than Wizards, wizards are nerds who sought magic out on purpose.\n\nSorcerers are characters who just **are** magic, whether they want to be or not, which really flings the door open on what kind of character they actually are and what they want. A Sorcerer could be a noble politician and merchant, or a scoundrel who grew up among thieves, or anything.\n\nBut what truly breaks the game is Subtle Spell.\n\nSubtle Spell allows Sorcerers to cast spells without looking like they're visibly casting spells.\n\nA subtle Minor Illusion can be an image or **a sound**, which means Sorcerers can just cause phantom sounds to happen around them. Cast the sound of people booing into the crowd at a public spectacle. Create phantom sounds, or illusory tricks that screw with people, without ever outing yourself as the source of the strange magical chaos happening around you.\n\nSubtle Catapult means objects just fly by themselves with destructive force. Useful in combat for the damage, useful out of combat for so much more. Frame people for assault, gaslight everyone into believing they're under attack by a poltergeist, spark violence at a protest by causing things to fly from one crowd into another.\n\nAnd then, there's enchantment magic. The mind control stuff, and the serious illusions.\n\nPhantasmal Force is a 2nd level spell which creates an illusion only your target can see, which your target believes is real and will rationalize any illogical outcomes from, and which can hurt them at 1d6 psychic damage per turn.\n\nSuggestion, also 2nd level, allows you to make one request, which, unless ludicrously unacceptable, they will do.\n\nThe ability to cast these spells on people without visibly casting spells on them is simply phenomenal. You can control other characters' entire perceptions of reality.\n\nA phantasm of an enemy attacking them paralyzes them into wasting their actions fighting their own shadow. A phantasm of fiery chains sprouting from the ground and tying them down, blinding and binding them, means they're now held, blinded, deafened if you'd like, and believe themselves to be completely ensnared. A phantasm of an electric-black net which unerringly flies out of your hand, wraps itself around the target's head and turns opaque while electrocuting them, turns a diving griffon on an attack vector into a stain on the ground.\n\nThis one time, my Sorcerer skipped an entire combat over a sword we were sent to retrieve by spinning a lie to its owner about how the sword was cursed, its bearers were fated to go mad, and the first sign of madness was that they would see snakes crawling on their skin.\n\nA subtle phantasmal force hit its mark, he failed the save, and that was that.",

Maybe he was a fighter, in the king's personal guard?! Or maybe this dwarf was a woman.... Hah, no. We all know there's no dwarven women. This dwarf was obviously a humble mushroom farmer who is venturing out in search of rare mushrooms across the world. \n\nFinally, we set up what this dwarf farmer looks like.

A “Class” is a general term for us, like Warrior, Ranger, Priest and so on. These all have their Specs/Subspecs. For example, Warrior has “Berzerker”, “Protector”, and “Legionnaire”. Each class has at least 3 subspecs, some of them more. Each Spec has a “Master Spec”, which is only unlocked after a certain mastery is reached. These Master Specs are considered our endgame in terms of Class and Skill development. My favourite is “Warlord”, the Subspec of Warrior/Legionnaire.

            "text": "Haven't played in years (planning to introduce my wife and son to it soon, he's just about old enough), but the most fun I ever had was with a character built on the Swashbuckler subclass from the AD&D 2nd edition Fighter's Handbook.\n\nThe key to that character was proficiency checks.  Dexterity and Charisma and the proficiencies in negotiation, intimidation, disguise, acrobatics, tumbling, and stuff like that... My DM for that campaign really wanted a fun campaign where we found innovative ways to solve problems, and he told us right up front not every fight would be winnable.  But avoiding a fight successfully would win *at least as much if not more* XP as winning with combat.  He also doubled our allotments for non-weapon proficiencies and tweaked the rules for them a bit, to encourage their use.  So I built a character for that kind of campaign, and I have to say it was a great time.  \n\nDual-wielding two rapiers with four total attacks per round, I could unleash some fury when I needed to, but I could also dedicate any or all of them to parries - so I could hold off four guards while the thief picked the lock of the door at the end of the hall so we could escape.  Three Musketeers, Erroll Flynn, Dread Pirate Roberts shit.  \n\nI was also proficient with a whip, and combining it with tumbling and acrobatics checks turned me into Indiana Jones, not to mention a prolific disarmer of cocky boss villains.  It doesn't get better than starting the scary boss confrontation by ganking his +3 mace of hurtiness right out of his hand while he's still monologuing.\n\nThat character was a pure agent of chaos, a real gambler's gambler.  His show-off antics could go horribly wrong with a bad roll or two, turning a routine encounter into a total fiasco, like when I lured a guard to chase me down a hall, running up the wall at the end to flip over him and grapple him, only to fail the roll and fall prone at his feet.  Or they could turn a terrifying boss fight into a hilarious anticlimax, like when we faced a manticore, and his opening move was to somersault and land right in front of the beast, unloading 3 nat 20s out of four attacks right in his stupid fucking face, before anyone else got off a shot.  Rolled lucky for damage, DM did the math and pronounced that I buried both rapiers crossguard-deep in its eyeballs, skewering its tiny brain and it dropped quivering to its belly on the spot.  I took some of the beast's hide and had it tanned, and had a new braided whip made from it.  DM volunteered that it should perform as a +3 (one +for each crit) enchanted whip, because it was made from the trophy of the luckiest roll he'd ever seen.\n\nBut lots of the fun was in using disguises, smooth-talking, gambling proficiency etc.  The gambling proficiency is like a mulligan for failed NPC negotiations.  If you can't convince them, you can offer to wager for the information you need.  It gives you a second chance, at least.   I learned I could combine it with the lucky whip... \"I bet I can whip this carrot out from between my friend's teeth...if I can do it you tell where to find One-Eyed Mort, and if I can't, I'll give you fifty silvers and the northwoman ranger here will dance naked on a table for five glorious minutes.\"  Other party members: \"Hey what the hell man?\"  Me, winking: \"Don't worry guys, trust me!  Lucky whip, remember?\"",

For some RP players it can mean really interesting combos with rich characters (old eastern Dragonborn monk named Wuxan).

So after a few tries I just switched to fighters or rangers or whatever because it wasn’t worth it, then eventually due to time and aging and moving and such I stopped playing altogether. \n\nThen during early covid quarantine out of extreme boredom I decided to try playing one of the starter 5E adventure modules on my own- created player characters, used an online dice roller to generate enemy stats when I got to encounters, wrote out battle sequences and character development bits in a notebook, and tried to be as strict with myself as possible. I picked character classes with die rolls and ended up with a paladin, a rogue, a wizard and a barbarian. And since it was just me, I finally got to play out a paladin as intended- brave, noble, well-intentioned, etc.- without anyone accusing me of being a stick in the mud or trying to take over the group, or anyone trying to corner  me into breaking some paladin rules or whatever.

Even with sneak attack being as easy as possible to get now, positioning and rolling a ton of die is too fun. Plus playing rogues is always fun. Thief Rogue is so fun once you can start getting your hands on forbidden magic items. \n\nPaladin - this is the epitome of a holy man/knight and it is amazing. The oaths all add amazing character flavor and fun character dynamics with hard principles that you won’t compromise on (unless?). You can tank/heal/dps all at the same time which is a dream come true for a support main like me. The best part? The auras. My team getting a +5 to all saves is god tier. Oath of Crowns FTW, you gotta deal with the shining beacon of light before you touch that rogue behind you. \n\nCleric - same deal with Paladin only issue is sadly that this class is all spellcasting. I’m not the biggest fan of spellcasting but I am a big fan of cleric spells as they do cool things like Spirit Guardian which I always use to enable melee cleric. Grave Cleric Plague Doctors are the best. \n\nBarbarian - I walk in. Rage. Attack with advantage. Deal huge damage. Walk out like a badass with a few scraps. Try and stop me. My favorite barbarian is a Warforged Warden of the Woods Barbarian who is half plant and lights some leaves on fire (medically in case it matters to any paladins) to rage. Otherwise I go Ancestor Barb, because I bet my Great Great Great Grandpa can beat you up. \n\nFighter - You cannot defeat a man with a sword and a mission. I don’t get the hype around Battlemaster personally, I’m sure it is as good as others say but you will never stop me from playing Champion for those crits. I especially love playing a ~~Cultist~~ Religious Man of Honor who has taken a Vow of Arcanum to remove all Magic from the world in order to save it from itself.",

There is so much going for it that I love. To start, the base class having you get more powerful by hurting yourself actually appeals to me in balancing risk vs. reward and the Lycanthrope part has an additional risk that you can lose control under dire situations. I also like the idea of playing a werewolf and Order of the Lycan is thus far the only one that I've seen that mechanically balances it that it is a curse (which most builds fail to do for me) while also not being so dangerous that it is worthless (like what the normal lycanthropy curse basically is.) I also have an alternative take if the DM doesn't want order of Blood Hunters that I would actually prefer (basically, rip out the whole order stuff and treat the Blood Hunter and Lycanthrope as mostly two separate things,) but my fear is that a DM would look at the character and try to heal them of their curse as if that would make a better story, despite that it would make them mechanically boring to me and cheapen their story.\n\nIf that wasn't allowed, then I would go for Hexblade Warlock. I like Warlock from a mechanical level with limited spell slots but getting all of them back with a short rest and they are always max level. And Hexblade hits that sweet spot for me of being a war mage. Bonus points is that Hexblade's lore is pretty new to me and gives me a chance to explore a war mage character from a different perspective.\n\nIf I can talk about Pathfinder, then definitely the Kineticist. Specifically, the Kinetic Knight archetype. The base class alone runs with the risk versus reward and makes you stick with the risk for an entire in-game day by having the HP damage you take unhealable by any means short of a long rest. But in return, you gain buffs for pushing yourself such as boosting your physical stats. Then the Kinetic Knight adds on top of that the ability to use different actions in combat with various costs instead of exclusively \"walk up and hit them.\" It is definitely a more difficult class to use as I barely scratched the surface on it, but that's what made me fall in love with it.",
