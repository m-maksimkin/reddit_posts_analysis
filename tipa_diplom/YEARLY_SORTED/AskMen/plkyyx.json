Which is really weird since questioning things and being skeptical should be positive traits in academics. No tolerance policies to any kind of violence almost universally only affect men, including boys defending themselves from bullies, or just two young boys solving things the way that boys do when no one gets hurt. I have friends to this day that I at one time got into a fight with as a young man where nothing resulted from our scrap more than a bloody nose or scraped knees and elbows, maybe a black eye.

This has lead to issues with the ongoing problem Of lower testosterone levels in men, the original cause of this can be traced to environmental xeno estrogens from plastic, look up PHTALATES, and with the stigma surrounding testosterone many doctors are afraid to prescribe it to men who are clearly deficient because “masculinity bad” “testosterone bad” “controlled substance bad”. This leads to men having to risk their freedom & health to buy testosterone illegally from steroid vendors because doctors refuse to take their health issues seriously. If this happened to women, it would be outrageous. If a doctor refuses to give birth control to a women for any reason other than “it would be extremely dangerous based on _____” they would be criticized. If a doctor refused to give a trans man over 18 T for hormone therapy, they would be called bigoted. But for cis men over 18 with clear results showing low T, It’s ok for them to be dismissed bc they are too young, or don’t need it, or TRT is dangerous and causes infertility.",

They would knock out that challenge in an hour. \n\nA man on the other hand cant just go have sex with a woman. First they have to be desired. Men are fat shamed just as much as women. If you don’t have abs or a flat stomach it’s embarrassing to take off your shirt. If you’re short, good luck. Penis size? Don’t even get me started on that. Balding, Body Hair, Acne, Too skinny, Bad teeth the list goes on. Any of those things is a valid reason to reject a man. Then we get into personalities and hobbies, jobs and money.

So I work a lot with my phone so, im known to reply to messages fast because I use my phone for work etc. One thing that generally pisses me off, when my gf does not reply  to texts or  calls. she will literally sit there and hear it go off or ring and just not care.\n\nBackstory : I ended up in the hospital a few months ago tried calling her, she didn't pick up I sent 2 messages no reply the entire day. I didn't want to call her mom it felt too rude. \n\nThe day after I finally get a reply : Oh I  heard my phone go off but I didn't think it was anything special, and you seem fine now. I had to hold so much yelling in at that exact moment lol( Im afraid to yell at her for things as she is Bi polar)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the rant my rant is : People that take Forever to reply to the phone when you KNOW they aren't busy they just do not care",

Women Still Play Catch-Up at Work.\nWomen are overrepresented in low-paying professions that require college credentials.\"\n\nI'm not claiming men and boys have it harder than women and girls; just that each gender faces specific challenges, and I wish there were more receptivity to discussing the specific challenges faced by men and boys.",

I bring it up to his father and it’s like I’m burdening him with work 🙄 \nHe is YOUR child, he doesn’t want to listen to me, he blames me for his mother leaving meanwhile I didn’t know the waste b!tch and she didn’t know me! They had been separated a whole YEAR and he had a couple gfs before me! We’ve been together for 5 years now! He’s explained this enough times and SS14 doesn’t care.. it’s still my fault. And I can’t help but be hurt cause I’m here raising him and his brother (SS7) and it’s like I’m some sort of live in nanny. I’m the only mother the youngest knows and because of what his brother tells him he doesn’t even hug me anymore. \nIt feels like I’m just running out the clock till they’re 18, and then possibly life will get better. Their father keeps telling me (he’s almost 18) like that means anything? He’s going to be a bigger problem then if he doesn’t get over his stubborn ways. MY DUDE IS BEING CHARGED WITH ARSON!! He’s already fcuked!! He got caught by cops and STILL denies it! \nAm I wasting my efforts? Cause he seems like he’s set in his ways.. there’s so much more to him and he won’t even give himself the chance to actually try. 😔\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I love him, but I don’t like him at all. As a person he’s the worst, I don’t even like bringing him around my family and friends.. when I do he always says or does something stupid! (Tried to make an autistic joke, KNOWING my son is autistic and my sister-in-laws brother is too! During a baby shower) 😤\nTrust me when I say he makes himself look bad, I wouldn’t have to write anything if you met him.. and that truly breaks my heart. He’s made me cry a few times out of frustration, his dad made him feel bad about it for all of 5 mins.. he rolled his eyes and went about his day and asked to play on the Xbox.\nThe most recent thing is him not having a phone right now, so the two days he’s been in class he’s already tried to swindle his dad into giving his phone back 🤣🤌🏽\n\nI’m 27, I didn’t ask for this life, I chose it. \nWho am I to give up on a child that CLEARLY needs stability. If he fcuks something up it will be by his own choices. I’m not going to aid in his problems and abandon him too! I just don’t know what to do anymore.. I’ve even thought about military school, but who can afford that 😓\n\nOne day, I just want one day of peace with him.",

But I hate the awful legacy system that was made to fight racism against orcs and drow while the company that owns DND has actual real-world racism problems in their walls. Orc lives don't matter, they are fucking pretend. WotC making diversity hires and then giving those people no work to do and not letting them on major products because they are just there for diversity's sake is the problem. I hate that every DND comment section of every DND FB group is filled with terrible ideas, like literally not a good idea in an entire section of comments because it is filled with fans that have never actually read a single page from the DMG, who think alignment for monsters is bad, that lich's should be chaotic evil, or gag villains, or their motivation for doing bad things should literally be \"I'm a lich I am just evil\" or that crazy homebrew items that cast 9th level spells at will are perfectly fine for a game so long as you claim they are legendary rarity. I hate that half of Tasha's Cauldron of Everything was either a reprint from other books or wildly busted and unplayable classes, like laughably unbalanced. And the new book Van Richten's didn't even give us new races it was just...legacies, and the 2 new subclasses are unplayably broken so I have to be the bad guy DM who after buying all the books tells my players that they can't play this shit (most of which are actually relieved to hear it won't be in the game). The book set to release soon is said to have 2 new races, cool, rabbitfolk which probably won't do anything new and just pander to furries, and farries which ironically are probably going to be one of the strongest races ever and the second race I have to ban from my game.

Why is it that there are no treatments to get these feelings to go away? Why is the focus SOLEY on a new gender identity and massive changes to one's identity instead of attempting to manage these feelings and get them under control? If I believed myself to be a quadrapelegic and a doctor said \"Welp, lets cut your limps off then\" then rightfully so that doctor would be considered a kook! Yet, this is considered normal treatment for people with gender dysphoria? To mutilate one's genitals and take hormones with the HOPE that other's will accept your gender truly?\n\n\nIn fact, why is this not a mental illness in the DSM? Why would this not be? Isn't having ideas that don't reflect reality a delusion? Aren't delusions hallmarks of mental illness? Why is this condition that has a near 50% suicide rate not considered a mental illness?\n\n\nHow can one's gender change? Sure, you can claim to be a woman, but for all intents and purposes gender only exists in humanity to find sexual partners. This is the only function of gender, for reproduction, otherwise the concept would not even exist in our species. Your gender does not matter in any other scenario, just when it comes to sex, in any other situation it is COMPLETELY irrelevant. Do people not understand that your gender is only really legitimate if you're seen as a legitimate sexual partner for those attracted to the gender you've transitioned to? You can say you're a man all day, but if people who are attracted men won't have sex with you because you were born a woman and don't possess the correct genitals for them to be attracted to then can you really say you've completely transitioned into being a man? When the only reason to have a gender in the first place isn't being legitimized? Sure we have gender roles, but in the 21st century in the West they are largely irrelevant to the behavior of individuals and so I doubt many trans people are transitioning just for the oppourtunity of working or being a stay at home parent when these roles are genderless now.\n\nI wonder how many people will think I'm hateful just for asking these genuinely innocent questions.",

They don't think, they don't listen.\n\nI'm at the point where if someone is repeatedly an asshole, doesn't contribute to the topic, has no actual points to make, nothing to back up whatever he is saying but if you back up your point he just goes \"no ur wrong\", or what he is saying has nothing to do with the topic, I just give them a link to google, wish them a good day and an easy life, and block them for good. Two strikes and they are out, because an intelligent person doesn't need a single one, and I am tired of primitive morons...\n\n---\n\nI love exchanging viewpoints with people who have a different opinion. It keeps my inherent bias in check and opens my angle on everything. I am a curious person and I love to understand things. Problem is, that people who like to argue and disagree with everything are also often absolute morons, and it is hard to find people to have actual discussions with.\n\n---\n\nThere was one time where I was lighting upon how terrible the US two-party system is for the society as the more the idiotic propaganda of lies and half truths get out of control, the more it shoves a wedge in society (and no dear US readers, I am not talking about the other party, I am talking about both of the circuses with all their respective clowns). And the problem is that people are misinformed, do not seek facts and independent sources, they just deepthroat whatever their party-loyal TV/Radio/Celebrity is saying. That they need to start acting intelligent and see the world not as black and white, as just with media, people tend to see only the extremes, reject good things because it comes from someone who once said a bad word, or ignore malicious deeds just because once that person did something good... and that is harmful.\n\nAnd as an example I brought up Hitler, since I assumed that despite the education being what it is, I'm sure the average person who went to school for a few years atleast \"knows the guy\". Because most people know him, and most people know what he did, and most people hate him and consider him one of the biggest scum in history. And they'd be right. He was truly one of the worst people in the history of mankind. And the moment I tell them \"and what if I said that even HE did something good, like uniting a depressed Germany, gathering the right people to breathe life into German economy and put the country on its feet? He was an absolute filth, and despite having ulterior motives, what he did there was good and useful for people\".\n\nAnd for me that's a good sorting system, because people with dirty socks for brain flip out and start calling me names, as their monkey brain gets triggered by Hitler and the word 'good' being used in the same paragraph and automatically assime I'm some nazi sympathiser. But people with above room temperature IQ (in celsius, the bar is low) say \"Um yea I guess. Sounds reasonable... and/but what about... [and the discussion begins with interesting points being raised]\".\n\n---\n\nTL;DR: What I hate talking about? Everything because a lot of people are overconfident retards.",

Something is wired the wrong way in their brain, and *there is nothing they can do to not be attracted to children*, with the exception of possibly chemical castration (I will admit I have not researched it very well and do not know how effective this method is).\n\nI completely understand why the LGBTQ+ community does not want to associate with pedophiles. They get enough crap and are put in enough danger as-is from people who hate them, and recognizing that pedophilia is not something that one can control could be devastating to the message they have worked so hard to get across, that they have no control over who they are attracted to or fall in love with (so long as the other person is able to consent). At the same time though, *pedophiles need help*. From articles and studies I have read, there are a lot more closet pedophiles out there who have to constantly struggle on their own to control their urges and never hurt children. And a lot of them end up failing, because the human sexual drive is extremely powerful. We need to look into the causes of pedophilia (whether it really is a brain-wiring issue or stems mostly from childhood abuse, etc.) and try to get these people help so that they don't hurt children. But nobody wants to talk about it, it is much easier to just consider them all evil, horrible human beings. It's not right. American society in particular is all about punishment after-the-fact, not about trying to solve the root issue, and unfortunately I do not see that attitude changing any time soon - to the detriment of us all.",

You’re either born male or female, and sometimes you rearrange that in one shape or another. I can understand that, it seems logical. But then there are those who don’t seem to stick to just male or female. Just the other day my friend introduced me to someone who called themselves a «Demi». They preffered to be called they/them, and they were «Neither male nor female, a little bit of both.» though they did say they felt more male (their birthgiven gender) than female. Sure i feel a little feminine at times, but i don’t decide to pretend i’m both male and female. The same friend inviter me to a Discord server. Thats where i met someone who called themselves: «A non-binary third gender.» I barely understand the motivation of non-binary people to begin with, and then i get curveballed by a third gender. He called it something like a Demi-gender, (I don’t get why they throw around the word demi either) And they too wanted to be reddered to as they/them. Their biological gender was female, but they said something about male hormones which i really didn’t understand. I really hope i don’t offend anyone with this, and again I’m open to change my opinion. :)",

This is just my OPINION\n\nI’m afraid at how detrimental the social contagion of transgender identity among adolescents and young teens is going to be in a few years. For those that go through with any type of medicinal puberty stunting, hormones or invasive medical procedures at a young age is going to be devastating once some kids grow up to realize it may have been a phase. I have read that trans identifying is similar to things like cutting, drugs and alcohol and eating disorders among children who share similar pain that hang out together. If a group is doing it, one may do so also to “fit in.” Once one grows out of the phase after years of breast binding, hormones, castration etc. they may realize they made a mistake and this is sure to be a very, very big problem. There’s just not enough scientific evidence to support supporting children to embrace their transgender identities when they don’t quite understand what that actually means for their future selves. And people treat this as a social issue when it is truly a medical and psychological one.\n\nJust my OPINION",

I get home from work that day and have crystal skull vodka and really nice bourbon on my desk with a note from my dad. He got angry because I told him I didn’t like it. Got called “a fuck of a son and ungrateful piece of shit”. I left and haven’t talked to him in like 3 years. But nobody has ever listened to my side of the story and everyone only knows about how I was ungrateful and how “he had never heard such obscene things from my mouth” ( I verbatim said “fucking depressed and shouldn’t be drinking alcohol”).

In American Sports (Basketball/Football), African Americans absolutely dominate, and in baseball they’re quickly becoming one of (if not the) main race in the sport. They dominate the athletic parts of most games, so why when they’re such a minority in the United States (13%)? Is it purely because cultural reasons where black people emphasize sports much more than any other culture (and somehow beat out a majority of other races who also undoubtedly have people who push themselves extremely hard), or is there a physiological reason too? \n\nAgain, as this is a backlash thread I just wanna say I only ask this question out of idle curiosity from being a sports fan, I don’t mean to poss off anyone",
