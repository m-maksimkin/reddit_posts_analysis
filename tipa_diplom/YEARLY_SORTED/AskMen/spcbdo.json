So I canceled that term of classes, got the refund in cash in person at the school (my mom had written a check and I had paid in person in the accounting office), then blew the money with my girlfriend for a super fun 2 weeks and slept in and fucked my gf the rest of the term.  When grading time came around I copied the source html of a page of previous terms grades and edited it to reflect the current term and class schedule I did have before I canceled them all.  I then printed it out, showed my mom the slightly better grades I had gotten since last term and mom was super proud of me for working so hard to improve my scores.\n\nMy gf at the time is now my wife of 18 years and we both fondly look back on this scheme we successfully pulled off as stupid teenagers.\n\nEdit:  Why is this being downvoted?

I had several dictionaries and two different sets of encyclopedias from my grandparents. they knew I could read and understand what I was reading as they had me prove it in order to get those books to help me understand the other books I was reading. one day it came up at a family function and my dad decided to prove it was normal that I could read so he went around the room to all the grandkids, cousins and such with a children's book  and listened to kids sounding out letters or others who \"were a bit behind\" as in could not identify letters. meanwhile I had just finished reading the Hobbit.",

Instead they fired her for a BS reason and I got pissed. Told the Vice Principal that a letter was going to every news outlet in town explaining the firing and I would ruin the school with bad PR unless they made it right. Gave them a week and started writing my letters. By the next week the VP pulled me out of gym class and handed me a group of files with candidates for a new teacher. She said they couldn't rehire my old teacher but they could let me choose the new one if I fidnt send the letters. Looked through the packets and noticed one was for a family friend. Picked him and enjoyed his classes for the next few years till I graduated. School ended up closing down a few years later, probably partially because of the wrongful termination suite that my old teacher filed. \n\nNever told my parents a word of this till a decade later when I told the story at a random dinner.

So I ask for her permission to drive her vehicle, with her and my friends in the car. We’re in the dirt roads near her house because she has a lot of land. I yank the handbrake and try to turn. But I turn into a ditch and the only thing that keeps us from flipping over is her barbwire fence. Her father decides he won’t get the authorities or my parents involved so long as I get a job and pay the costs. The damages were a about a couple grand.

One time, when we were out camping with my parents' friends, it was late, chilly and we were all sitting around a campfire. Eventually they all got into the topic of death. Seriously distraught by something they said, I asked my parents if they would die one day too, as some 10-15 people around the campfire were silently entertained. My father, always the pragmatic realist, chuckled with a \"well, but of course\". As 4-year-old me started crying, literally everyone around the campfire starts laughing. I remember being very angry at that, because this was _serious_. They asked for what reason I was so concerned about this, right there and then. Being a pragmatic realist, just like dad, I asked them in the most desolate, sobbing tone: \"Who's gonna be there then, to make me grape juice?\"\n\nIt took a few years for me to realize how my selfish, shortsighted and immediate little kid concerns made the whole situation so funny to everyone there. I regretted it once, for being laughed at my legitimate grape juice concern, then again a few years later. At 6 or 7, I felt bad for having blurted that out, because I knew that my parents meant a lot more to me than grape juice makers tall enough to reach the kitchen counter. That wasn't what I meant and I insisted in making sure they knew that.\n\nMany years later, this still gets talked about when we meet some of the people who were there that day, except now I finally laugh _with_ them. 😎🧃",

I had a lot of teachers that loved my sense of humor and would even play along.  Those teachers would ask me nicely to stop if I would take it to the point of being disruptive and I would stop.  The not so tolerant teachers would immediately call my parents.  My dad was well known in town and many people respected him so he would take it personal if a teacher called.  His form of discipline was physical.  Usually spankings with a belt or some object.  At times he would hit me so hard I would of rather it been his fist in my face.  Well, he got carried away one time when I was around 11-12 and was missing my ass and pretty much just whipping my back.  I am not sure if he was drunk or what but I remember he hit me over 20 times to the point I could barely sit in school the next day.  My back, thighs, and ass were literally black and blue.  I never mentally got over that and I started looking for ways to cope.  At that young age I felt like my parents had already given up on me so why should I care.  I turned to very excessive eating and by the time I was 15 I started trying alcohol and marijuana.  I got arrested at 16 and things got even worse.  I was at rock bottom and really just needed a good form of support but I had no where to turn.  Parents didnt believe in therapy, thought adhd and add were made up all of that good stuff.  My father and I begin to argue one day because I told him I would like to move out and move in with my friend and his mom.  He finally loses his shit and tells me I can go but to leave my phone car keys and everything else behind.  My mom doesnt agree with this (I am still 16 at the time) and says I am still her son and she wanted me to have my phone so we can stay in touch and my vehicle so I could come and visit.  My dad flips out and for the first time I watch him yell at my mom how he did to me all of those years.  I can’t remember all that was said because I only remember his last words to her and that was “ ITS HIM OR ME!”  And he stormed off.  I told my mom I had damaged the family enough and I would just go.  I turned around and walked out and no one ever came after me.  After that day I slowly became a raging alcoholic.  I have not considered myself an actual part of the family for over 17 years now.  I have a brother and sister and I visit them at my parents house for the major holidays but I never feel welcomed.  I always knock when I go over there and my dad always says “you dont have to knock, your family.” and it always makes me sad because I know I am not.  I have never brought this situation up to anybody in my life.  Not sure why I felt like sharing it, but there you go.  My secret.\nI have currently been working on quitting drinking as of January.  I am struggling big time but I have made it a whole week sober.  That was my longest run since 16 so I guess it is something.",

Over the course of that year, I finished Final Fantasy XII, and to do this day, it's easily in my top 5. \n\nWhen it was time to catch the bus, I'd sneak back into my parents closet and leave my controller behind, and they never suspected or noticed. When they gave my controller back, I remember the conversation about being given it back after such a long time, and I had better have learned how to be responsible. I did not learn how to be responsible, but I did learn how to be very quiet, so there's that I suppose.",

I said sure come on by but I’m gonna have to throw it out of my second story window as my parents were already suspicious of my activities and would question why I was leaving and immediately returning. \n\nSo the two guys get there and I open my window and say alright tuck the money in the snow somewhere, which one of them did, and then I tossed the baggie out the window. Well the wind took it and it landed in my neighbors front yard (city block front yard). No problem, one of them opens my neighbors fence, grabs it off the ground, then they leave. All is well. \n\nI make my way downstairs to go about trying to retrieve the money, when I see my mom peering out the front door after just having watched the hole deal take place. I play dumb and asks what she’s looking at, to which she replies that two sketchy looking guys just picked something up in our elderly single female neighbors’ yard. I’m like that’s weird whatever. She didn’t catch that they were talking to me or anything and we both forgot about it.\n\nAbout a week later my mom randomly brings it up again, she’s like remember those guys in cheryls yard, I’m like uhhh yeah. She goes “Well apparently Cheryl lost her keys at some point and those two guys we saw pick something up in her yard must’ve found them! And they’re going to break in and rob her!” I was like oh fuck. Now what? Mom says that she’s now having to change all of her locks. \n\nSo I made this old woman do all that work nothing…. \n\nI think my mom would’ve found it funny all these years later and I wish I could tell her but she passed a few months ago. \n\nAnyway sorry Cheryl!

They'd probably be rather put out if they knew about some of my more casual periods of 'dating' - but they don't imagine the right questions. So I never had to think about hiding anything about that. \n\nOr, just just how disconnected they were with all my friend groups. \n\nLike, they had been supportive in some ways of my music, got me lessons. But when I started playing metal, they were just complaining here and there. I thus was just not sharing anything about what was going on with me musically. I think they heard from a family friend, 'are you going to see your son's show this weekend?' \"what show? He has a band?\" \"uh, ya, they play all the time...\" \n\nParents came to this punk, hardcore, gothy club to see me play some, basically ...horror folk. Dressed in LL Bean and Walmart, they looked a bit out of place in a sea of face piercings and tattoos, dyed black hair and white face paint, vampire fangs, not Halloween. The opening act was a side show, i.e. circus freaks. I introduced them to all those people. They were offered weed and other stuff lol.",

She got me and seemed a bit disappointed in my partying and was pretty irritated that she now had over an hour round trip to get me to my truck and back home. She was confused as to why I was at a gas station as well, but I don’t remember what I told her as my excuse.\n\nWhat my mom doesn’t know is that the reason I was in that condition and at a gas station was because I was raped that night. The friend who promised me a ride back to my truck was the one who did it. Since I didn’t have a vehicle, I was stranded, which made everything worse. That morning after I woke up I went to the living room only to find him chugging a six pack as if nothing happened. I had to wait until he was ready. It wasn’t until he drank his 4th or 5th beer that I finally decided I was done with this shit and left. \n\nTo this day, I have never told my mom what happened and I’ve never once left my truck behind.",

I learned pretty early in life that if I found something I truly enjoyed, like playing an instrument or learning about a particular subject, the quickest way to ruin that for myself would be to tell my parents. It would, at that point, cease to be a labor of love and become a sport with a scoreboard. There would be regimens and benchmarks and expectations for me to \"prove\" my dedication to things I only ever wanted to peacefully enjoy.\n\nI'm in my 30s now and still see my parents 2-3 times a month, sometimes more. We get along great. That's because as far as they know, I live the most drone-like life in the history of the human race. Every accomplishment I've shared with them, every promotion I've gotten, every skill I've picked up or milestone I've reached, as far as they know, has fallen right into my unsuspecting lap. I am perpetually minding my own business when lightning strikes and I happen to catch it in a bottle.\n\nI don't tell them what my aspirations are until I've met them. I don't tell them about my problems until I've solved them. I don't share my feelings with them until the events in question are distant memories.\n\nThey've been amazing parents in almost every way. They are incredibly warm/thoughtful people and I've never once doubted their love for me or my siblings - they are just not capable of watching my life's journey unfold without trying to take the wheel. So I don't let them in the car anymore, and at the end of the day we're all happier for it.",

I was a passenger in my friend's b5 s4 which, at the time had about 350hp. So we're driving down the i87 and we stop at a rest area. When we get back to the car, he asks me if I want to drive. Of course I do. I get in the car, ease into 1st, then second gear. Get back on the highway in 3rd and floor it. Fourth gear to red line. By the time I'm at 5500rpm in 5th I look at the speedometer. I thought I was going 200kmh. Nope. 255. I put it in 6th and let off the gas.\n\nThat same weekend at waterfest, I am at the hotel parking lot, as drunk as I can be and am enjoying the endless burnouts. Some kid in a bmw does a burnout just as the cops show up. Well. As the lady cop does her thing, I take a photo with my camera. The flash set her off. She confronted me and confiscated my camera. The next morning I had to go to the police station to claim it. The agent at the station had a chuckle when I told him my story and was more than happy to hand it back. On the official paper it was written that the camera was confiscated due to my public disturbance.

It was my sister's best friend, so we had known each other a long time and when high school hit, we dated right away. My parents were cool with it as long as we weren't doing any shady shit. (We did.)\n\nOne day I went out of town to visit my best friend who had just moved to Arizona the previous year. I was there for about two weeks. During that two weeks, my gf at the time slept with my, then, closest friend. I would dare say he was competing for best friend status.\n\nI found out when I came home and she was acting all weird around me. I was devastated.\n\nI walked out of my house livid, fuming, whatever you want to call it. I was fucking PISSED. My mom followed me and I walked about 3 blocks away. She kept her distance because she could tell how hurt I was. I got down to a building not too far from the house and I unleashed on a steel door.\n\nMy mom watched me as I did it, but didn't interfere. She knew. She KNEW what I was feeling. After I collapsed from pain, and tears rolling down my face, she grabbed me and held me as tight as she could. Told me everything would be okay. She was there for me in one of my weakest adolescent moments. \n\nMy mom was a saint that day. If I didn't know she was following me, I have no idea what could have happened to me that day. I'll never forget this day. We've been much closer since then, thankfully.\n\nI've tamed my rage, and I've moved on. The steel door won that day. Hard. I still have a messed up knuckle due to breaking it, not getting it looked at, and letting it heal weirdly.\n\nTL;DR - Ex slept with my best friend while I was out of town, mom nearly saved my life from doing something stupider than I did.",

Said the school must have messed up the report cards before sending them home. \n\nWhere I got lucky was, that other parents had noticed discrepancies as well.

We spoke for months, occasionally on webcam, never exchanged any pictures or dirty talk, just sort of \"cant wait to hold hands and have picnics\" kind of talk. \nOne day he says he's gonna move to England, (completely unprompted by me) but doesn't have enough money to buy a house so decides he's going to live in one of the empty sheds in the allotments over the road from my house (dont know if Americans have these but they're basically a bunch of vegetable gardens for old people that don't have gardens of their own) and get a job then save up for a house.\nHe sells everything in his apartment - couch, TV, consoles, computer, everything but the kitchen sink - and buys a plane ticket. I toldbhin it was a bad idea and tried to put him off the entire time, but he was determined and there was nothing I could do about it. We planned the meet up, I went *alone* withoutbtelling anyone where I was going but he didn't show. \nI go home and about an hour later he Skypes me from the airport to say they won't let him stay in the country because he doesnt have the funds so he's being sent home in 24 hours. \nAt this point, my parents go out for the night.\nAirport security give him 4 hours to leave but he has to come back and be on his flight or else shit storm. So he gets a taxi and comes to my **empty** house where I'm completely **alone**. Quick reminder, he's 24, I'm 15, my parents have no idea i have a complete stranger coming to the house while they're out.\nHe came, we hugged, he kissed my cheek, I got nervous and he had to leave because my neighbour started getting nosy and the airport only gave him a few hours before he had to be back anyway. Very anticlimactic but he ends up going home to absolutely nothing because he sold all his shit.\nA week or so later, I realised how stupid the whole thing was, broke it off and he went absolutely ape-shit crazy blaming me for having lost everything despite me telling him not to do it. I deleted him.\nThe year I turned 21 I got a random message from him out of the blue on Facebook asking if I would be up for talking to him again. I shut that shit down QUICK and haven't spoken to him since.",

My mom and dad thought that was a great idea and even offered their brand new car for us to use the week we would be gone.\n\nThing is, we didn’t go to my friends grandfathers house, we drove almost a 1000 miles (each way) to Las Vegas.  After we had driven a few hundred miles we disconnected the speedometer (gear driven) so they wouldn’t know the real miles we racked up on their new car.  Had the time of our life.  We slept in the car and cleaned up at truck stops along the way.  This was back in the mid 70’s and the strip wasn’t even part of Las Vegas yet.

We decided the smartest thing to do was do a bunch of donuts in the empty lot next to the building then scatter all the snow we shoveled up. It looked like someone drove in, did donuts, then the car as they left.\n\nWe then hopped in the other friend's car and drove to the movie theater so it looked like we had met up to carpool.

I was freaking out internally but kept my cool and told him fine, go get a drug test and let's do this. I was going to try and play his bluff. But, he wasn't bluffing. He threw a walmart bag at me and told me to take the damn test. I saw the receipt, he purchased it almost a month ago and waited til I did something he disapproved of.\n\nPissed on the damn thing and had the most stressful 10 minutes of my life waiting to be kicked out, knowing full well none of my family would take me in after that. Test came back clean somehow. I was flabbergasted, i still to this day think it was because it was a shitty at home walmart test. I acted offended and pissed off and left the house, as he fell over himself for accusing me and not believing me. Called my mother and it turns out they both had planned to test me, but my dad did it first. At least she didn't find out I smoked weed until my dad eventually did kick me out for other bullshit.

She wanted me to cut it I did not want to cut it at all. It was super long, curly, kind of matted, really unruly and super messy, she hated it. She told me if my school picture looked bad she would make me cut it, I brushed her off. \n\nThe night before those pictures I had stayed at a friends house. Slept on the floor, didn’t shower yada yada. All my friends and I piled in one of our cars and drove to school to get our schedules and take pictures. I was a dumb teenage boy and didn’t think anything about the picture, took it and went on with my life.\n\nA few weeks into the school year we get our ID’s and whatever pictures we had ordered. My pictures were awful. I mean it was just so bad. Completely matted down on one side, totally unruly sticking out on the other side, I knew I was doomed. \n\nSo I came up with a solution. I threw all the pictures away in a trash can at a gas station and stashed the envelope the pictures came in in my car. I called off work for that afternoon and went home, washed, conditioned, dried and brushed my hair. Made it as nice as I could, made the curls super nice gave it that “Josh Groban” look my mom would eat up. Put on a nice collared shirt and went to Walmart. At that time they still had photo studios. I told the tech I wanted the most “school photo” picture possible, just one pose nothing more. Took the photo and ordered the smallest package of photos they had which was like ten times more photos then my mom ordered. Tech said they’d be ready the next day. \n\nThe next day after school I went and picked the photos up. Threw away like 90% of them at the Walmart put the rest in the school photo envelope thing. Went home plopped em on the table and went to work. \n\nMom never said a word to me besides “oh your school pictures look nice!” \n\nLater on in the year she asked me if I wanted a yearbook and knowing full well what picture would be in there I declined. I think I said “no that’s ok it’s just my junior year I’ll get one my senior year but I don’t need this one!”\n\nShe never knew till like a decade later when I finally told her.",

The statue hit the slate and shattered into a couple hundred pieces. I spent the next two days with that statue laid out on card tables. Two bottles of super glue later the whole thing was glued back together. It was painted Chinese porcelain and I did a fantastic job. 25 years later, when they were moving out of that house, they called me up and asked me if I knew that it was broken. I had to confess.

            "text": "I was a teenager without a car, it had been totaled. I was working at a call center after school, just doing surveys, but skipped work one night to go get drunk with my friends. The friends Mom came home early so I had to slip out and then walk home drunk. I climbed over a wall, came down the wrong way, and ripped up my face. I’m fairly sober by the time I get home. Dad is out of town (so lucky on this point) and Mom takes one look at me, she’s buzzed, and assumes I was at work and got jumped on the way home, and calls the cops. I just kind of go with it, my goal being to avoid trouble. \n\nThe walk home from work- the opposite direction I was actually in- takes me through a mall parking lot. The cops check with the mall management, turns out the lights shut off for awhile at approx the time I should have been walking through. Also turns out 2 police dept’s have argued over who should patrol the area, so no one does. But remember, I was never there that night, I was out partying. \n\nSo, there’s this whole luncheon thing that happens later, with police chiefs and pictures of my injured face circulated around, plus the mall mails me a check for damages, not a lot, this is in the 80’s, but enough to buy a used 1970’s car. I mean, just a simple call to see if I had been at work would have changed everything. I mean, this wasn’t some backwards place, it was southern CA in the mid 80’s. \n\nMy sister watched me suspiciously throughout these events, and then overheard the ONE thing I said to ONE trusted friend months later, and the game was up. I did some chores in exchange for her silence, and then something else came up a year later that I covered her on which guaranteed continued silence. I’ve never even felt guilty about it. Just grateful my Dad was out because he would not have bought any of it for even a second.\n\nIf it weren’t for things like this, I’d probably be an atheist. But shit like this makes me wonder. \n\nMan, for real, free range parenting really enabled me and my siblings to learn to be adaptable and think quick on our feet.",

I went to my next door neighbor who used to chat with me and was kind of like the grandpa I never had and I told him I was ordering a Christmas gift for my parents and asked if I could have it shipped to his house. \n\n\nHe agreed and I ordered it. What my dumb horny 15 year old ass didnt realize was that the box was going to have a return address on it. The day the packaged was arrive I waited in front of my bedroom window and watched them drop it off. My neighbor came out, looked at the package, and angrily glared at my window. I swear I could feel his eyes piercing me with rage. I ran outside and grabbed the package and went to my room. Sure enough the return address said something like \"big wet booty sex toy emporium\" on it in big red letters. \n\n\nThe next day my neighbor called me over and told me to NEVER EVER EVER send anything to his house again. I was petrified and asked if he would tell my parents and he said \"naw I think the embarrassment of me finding out is sufficient punishment\". He ended up passing away like 6 months later and never told my folks.

Skipped every single one and flunked my heaviest semester. Dropped my GPA to like a 0.2 and I got kicked out of school. Actually got kicked out a whole semester after, because my stupid guidance councilor or whoever sets you up with classes and discusses GPA issues like that neglected to tell me if I didn’t retake the exact classes the next semester to reset those scores my GPA wouldn’t change enough and I’d be auto-kicked out. Got off the shitty meds then reapplied to the school through a letter to the dean or whomever and got back in. Took the next semester with great grades and halfway through my parent’s kicked me out of the house.. just never went back to class due to that. They know I never finished but they thought I just quit at that point, don’t know the stuff in between.\n\nThey keep telling me to go back and use the credits I got… except I didn’t get many at all. Also gotta say, being extra depressed because of drugs is a fucked up and weird feeling. Like you KNOW its the meds, and it feels different from normal depression. Just a crazy odd and horrible feeling. Telephone poles we’re very enticing when I drove to school at that time.",

I have a white house, 2 story with wooden side panels. \n\nWe were kicking a tennis ball around and decided if would be a good idea to dip it in gasoline and then lay it on fire and continue kicking it back and forth. After about the 4th kick the flame started to diminish so I went and got the gas can and poured directly from the gas can onto the lit fire ball. Obviously, the fire retracted back into the can and I instantaneously freaked out. Spinning around, the fire began to shoot out of the gas can and all over the side of my house and I sort of rainbow fashion.\n\nWe ran to the backyard to get the hose however, the hose wasn't long enough. The fire continued to burn the side of my house. Luckily we had a side door where the house is burning my friend and I created an assembly line of Tupperware containers filled with water. You can only imagine how poorly this effort worked. Luckily, it wasn't so much gasoline that it would burn the house down just char all the white paint on the side of the house.\n\nI didn't know what to do so I went downstairs and got a bottle of bleach. It was a little help, obviously. I go down to the basement and find 16 different types of white paint. Who the hell knew they make that many different types of white paint? So I bring every one of them upstairs and start dipping paint brushes into them mixing them together and splashing and all the side of the house.\n\nLuckily my parents were in Canada at a casino for the next couple days. We let it dry overnight and invited a couple of friends over the next day. Without explaining anything we asked them if they could tell anything was wrong with the house? With our luck they said no. After some time you could begin to tell where the fire was because we used to make sure of exterior and interior paint and it did not hold well against the wood. My dad over the years asked me several times what had happened? And I always responded with I don't know what he was talking about.\n\nWhen I turned 25 we had to sit down dinner with my friends and family and had some beers at a local tavern and told the story to them luckily they thought it was funny.",

We woke up in the car at around 4:00am after our buzz wore off and It looked like we murdered someone on the back seat. I sat in the car for a bit thinking about what I was going to do because there was no way I was going to get all that blood off the seats in time. Then I remembered my buddy had feozen rats he kept for feeding his python. So I thawed one out in a bowl of hot water, cut its guts open and tossed it on the back seat, hurried home before sunrise and left the back windows down when I parked the car in the driveway.  \n\nI got in trouble, but only because I left the windows down so a cat could drag a bloody rat into the car lol\n\nI told my dad about it many years later and he told me he already knew what really happened and figured it out while he helped me clean the blood off the seats. he said \"I know what period sex smells like, but I was so impressed by your attempt to hide it that I kept my mouth shut\"",

One was that since the house was like a century old, all the internal locks were standard locks with the same skeleton keys. I biked to the nearest Ace hardware store and bought a pair of [these](https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/97511453-70e3-4746-b3bc-75c0ac51f9cb/svn/hy-ko-keys-kc200-64_1000.jpg) and never told my parents about it. Since I had the same keys as my father he couldn't lock me out of any room. That being said, that method involved me walking through their room with them asleep which was still risky so I also had another tactic. [One of the windows of that office opened into the balcony, which was accessed through my sister's room. ](https://i.imgur.com/ijG6Vto.jpg) I would unlock that window when I was in there and until my father noticed it was unlocked and locked it, I would go through my sister's room and break in through the window instead, and when it was locked I would just go unlock it during the day at some point. Also, that window was used as a getaway a lot when my father was in his room awake and I needed to get out.",

I crawled up on my bed as fast as I could and played dumb when they asked what the sound was. I had a humongous lump on my head, but I didn’t want to tell my dad because I knew he’d yell and mom had already left for work. \n\nEnded up going to school like that and suffered from a splitting headache all day. Got home and decided to tell my sister. She looked at my head, saw the lump, freaked out and told mom. \n\nMom took me to the hospital and I just told the hospital I got dizzy and fell. Queue two MRIs and a sleep test (that I never knew the name of) and I was given a clean bill of health.

            "text": "God, where to start...\n\n1. Racing a new cobra mustang with my moms 15-ish year old station wagon.\n\nIn my home town, there is a main street (at least 6 lane).  For a stretch of (1/4 mile? Half mile?) it goes through a kinda wooded area (no streets/ intersections/ driveways/ whatever). For some reason, it has a stop light, just before and after this stretch.  I pull up to the light, and a moment later a new cobra mustang pulls up next to me.  So, to have fun, I roll down my window, put on my sunglasses, and start revving the engine.  My moms car looked like this: [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:84-85\\_Chevrolet\\_Celebrity\\_wagon.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:84-85_Chevrolet_Celebrity_wagon.jpg)  \n\n\nGuy laughs. Light turns green.  I stomp on the gas, and so does he.  About the time my car has thought of accelerating, I am left behind in a cloud of burned rubber from the mustang, as he is way gone.  The speed limit is \\~45mph and he had to be doing at least 90 at this point.  \n\n\nI see him hit the brakes as he is like half way to the next light, and he starts coasting to a stop.  \nWhat he didn't know is I never took my foot off of flooring it.  \nSo, about the time he is 85% of the way to the next light, and rolling to a stop, I am coming in as full throttle as I can in this 1985-ish wagon.  \nAs I pull up near him, I slam on the brakes, go into a full fish tailing skid, and kinda slide into a stopped position at the next light..... about 15' ahead of him (as he is rolling to a stop).\n\nI look over give him a good \"sup?\" look, and he explodes laughing.  Like crying laughing.  \nWe both go on our way with a good laugh.\n\n2. Jumping railroad tracks at night in the country with my moms station wagon.\n\nIf you read the story above, it may not be a surprise that I took the same car and jumped some elevated railroad tracks at like 50mph.  I bottomed out so hard I thought I blew out the rear-windshield.  Drove to a friends house immediately after, parked car, and was puzzled on why it wouldn't start.  Apparently, the mechanic said the oil plug was gone, and mom had questions about some scratches under the car.  At the time, I legit, couldn't put the two together, so I wasn't lying about having no idea.  I just didn't mention jumping train tracks.  \n\n\nYeah.  I totally knocked out that plug in hindsight.\n\nAs a teen I thought to myself, \"Knowing all the dumb shit you have done, how would you like to have been your own parent?\".  When that lightbulb went off, it was the best \"don't have kids till you are ready\" moment.",

My earliest memories are with them and it was a happy childhood at their house. When my dad remarried I had to move back with him and almost immediately I wanted to run away and go back to my grandparents. He always was in a bad mood, mealtimes were super quiet and awkward and I felt like I needed to walk on eggshells. Many times he would trash the house if he felt it wasn’t clean enough. Though he never helped to clean anything. Anything would set him off. Any grades below a B would be received very badly by him and over time the anxiety would get to where I couldn’t stand it. I couldn’t trust him to talk about it, so I tried to deal with things in my own. \n\nSo there were two nights I decided I didn’t want to live anymore.

I don’t trust my parents to actually take me seriously so I’ll probably never talk to them about my many problems because I fear I’ll only be judged. It’s hard to live every day constantly hitting new lows and knowing that there is no way to get help because nobody will believe you. I want things to change and to get better but it’s really hard to believe that they actually will.",

So my first few days went well learned several knots, how to start a fire, easy ways to make tinder, the whole 9. Towards the end of the week the scout leaders picked up that I wasn’t really interacting with the other kids at all because I wasn’t comfortable with the whole “social interaction” thing, and one meet the scout leaders made me be the den scribe, so I would write down everything that was said (ex. Upcoming event dates, ideas for events, general lesson information) and recite it to the entire den after the meet…\n\nI am a stutterer.\n\nI was RELENTLESSLY mocked, laughed at, and honestly down right bullied at this meet and the scout leaders did nothing.. I walked outside hid for awhile and cried and cried I was so upset after a short time one of the leaders came out and talked to me. To which I told him I just want to go home. So he let me sit outside until the meet was over went home with my parents and each time they would ask why I didn’t want to go back it was, “I just didn’t like it.” Or other similar excuses.\n\nI look back on this and laugh now but at the time I was absolutely devastated. I eventually told my parents a few years ago and they felt horrible but they couldn’t control it that’s just how it be sometimes.\n\nTL;DR: Got ruthlessly bullied by my cub scout “friends” because I’m a stutterer and kept it from my parents for years.",

Grandmother thought I was just a kid doing stupid kid shit; I stuck a fishing rod into a light socket, not realizing that they're made it of something non-conductive because of lightning.\n\nMy father never knew this, and my mother was made aware, but thought I was lying. One of my friends was 16 and had been kicked out of his parents' place, so he had his own apartment. We hung out there a lot and I slept over often. Shortly after his 17th birthday, I was 13. Killer Instinct had come out on the SNES that day, so we spent the day playing it. I woke up that night to him molesting me. I told my mom, but she's from that generation where Everything Your Child Does That You Don't Like Is Disrespect, and the solution to a child disrespecting you in your house is to throw them out on the streets for a week and that they could only come back when they learn to \"show you respect\". She thought I was lying to her, and how dare I make up stories and lie about my best friend, and Lying To Me Under My Roof Is Disrespect, so I got kicked out for a week, and where was the only place I had to go? Back to that friend's place. He was my only real friends at the time, and I didn't want to end up actually on the streets, so I just pretended to sleep through his molesting, which eventually turned to rape. I was molested and raped a good 50+ times by him, and at least 9/10 of that was because he was the only place I could stay whenever my mother kicked me out.\n\nMy mother's boyfriend was from another country, and living with us. His son was finally coming to Canada to live with us, but a few days before his son got here, he came home early from work, pinned my up against a wall with a knife to my stomach, and told me that if his son does ANYTHING that I do; watches the same kind of movies (I'm a huge horror fan), or starts to dress/look like me, listen to the same kind of music, want the same kind of clothes, etc (I was hardcore Goth/Riverhead at the time) that he'd kill me and bury me in the huge forest behind where we lived. I want allowed to come out of my room or do anything with the rest of the family unless he was the one asking. I never really got along with my mother, but he basically forced me to build a huge wall between us when I was honestly trying to have a better relationship with her. He just really didn't want his son to look like some girly f*ggot freak, because \"my mother may have completely fucked up raising me, but his son wasn't going to turn out to be some kind of freak/failure\"\n\nThen there's all the drugs.. I think there was definitely suspicions, because I know my dad and mom were both hardcore party freaks in the 60s-70s and that the both of them were really into drinking, coke and pills.. but other than finding some weed once, I don't think either of them had the slightest idea of just how fucked up I was getting ALL there time.. I used to sleep on Wednesdays because that's the only night of the week nothing was happening; every other day, I had a friend that was a dealer and very liberal with sharing with his friends, so for a good year and a half I was just eating whatever pills he'd have on hand and down it with booze.. a good 3-4 pills a day..\n\nThere's way more, but I'm getting really suck off typing this much on mobile 🤣",

One day they removed to wifi from my phone because they would always enter the password. A couple days later I snuck in there room and found a slip of paper: Gp3FjQNX. Got on my phone and tried it out, and it worked! When they checked my phone and found out they were pissed, so they removed it again and told me they changed the password. So one day doing homework, I opened up the wifi setting and poked around and figured out that if you highlighted the \"asterisked\" steam of letters for the password and right clicked it, you could select \"insert unicode lettering\" and it would show the password. I was in again. After they got on my phone and found out the second time, my dad went on a tangent and said \"good luck figuring out this time, it's 16 letters long\". As he had just gotten up from the keyboard, I figured he had just entered some sequential stream of letters from the keyboard in an easily-momorable fashion. So I walked over and tried \"1qaz2wsx3edc4rfv\". They claimed I was \"criminally gifted\" and that I would 100% end up in jail some day. I later figured out that you could use \"shutdown -i\" in command prompt and you could use that coupled with a quick look in the school's public server for computer names to remotely shut down any computer in the school at any time. After teaching my friends the school had to crack down and figure out how everyone's computers were shutting off with stupid little notes attached with shutdown timers. The method of shutdown was completely customizable. They think I'm some kind of computer Einstein and most of it was really just google🤷‍♂️",

A year prior, they had told us it would be impossible for us to conceive. We had a difficult time with the news & our families were very supportive. They too went through the grieving process with us. \n\nWhen we discovered the pregnancy we thought we had to give the “miracle” a fighting chance, even though it was very risky for Mother & fetus. \n\nMade it past the 3 month mark. During the last month, We had 3 trips to the ER & the complications just kept getting worse till it was no more. It was one of the hardest nights in our lives & unbelievably painful. Labor pains/the miscarriage lasted almost 14 hrs. We lost power & almost all comforts for 3 hrs in the middle of the night due to a freak wind storm, almost at the crescendo of the ordeal.  I’ll never forget that night for the rest of my life.  \n\nThe first person I told about our pregnancy was my sister. We had been talking on the phone about health issues (cancer) & had asked for an update. We had just found out a few hours ago about the official test results & the doctor warned us that the chance of death was astronomical for one, possibly both of them. That news, compiled with the other health issues we were battling, was too much and I broke down crying. I told her the truth. \n\nShe responded by yelling, telling me that I needed to speak with a mental health professional, (which she knew I already was), SO much attitude, and just hung up on me. \n\nI was in shock, just sitting there, silent tears streaming down my face. My partner had been sitting next to me on the couch holding my hand & heard the whole thing. Equally jarred and bewildered.\n\nThat response, has prevented me from talking to any of my family members about the entire pregnancy and loss. It’s so much to deal with for the two of us, pretty unbearable to think of it causing any more drama/stress. \n\nMy sister hasn’t communicate with me in over 10 months, (ever since that conversation).  Not to check in, apologize, inquire about my partner’s health, etc.  I feel  like she’s cut me to my absolute core. Ever time I think about talking to her, I get so upset, it’s like scratching a wound. \n\nMy mother has asked why we haven’t spoken & all I can say is, “She acted in a way that requires a conversation & an apology that I’m not willing to instigate.” \n\nSometimes, I think about telling my mother. I just don’t know if I have the emotional capacity/mental space to deal with the consequences of sharing. I feel so broken & beat down. \n\nEverything has been so brutal and relentless and isolating these past few years. I don’t know how much more I can take.\n\nEdit:  Thanks for providing a space to vent. After taking a moment, I actually feel a little lighter.",

My dad went to work in California while we lived in Texas. \n\nMost importantly… Jackass just came out on MTV and it was insanely popular. \n\nMy friends and I were always at my house. There was no parental control. Ring doorbells were not even thought of. WiFi wasn’t even a thing back then. We had zero guidance and no adult to tell us not to do this or that. \n\nMy buddy one day brings a camcorder and we thought it would be a good idea to light ourselves on fire. I had multiple layers of sweaters and jeans soaked in lighters fluid. \n\nI lit myself on fire and ran around the pool and it went out. We tried again but I decided to run away from the pool. Now I’m too far away from the water and the flames are shooting about the garage. \n\nI stop, drop and roll to no avail. I rip off the sweaters and was relived until I see my buddy’s face in complete shock. I had 3rd degree burns on my chest, lips and nose. \n\nI was rushed to the hospital and my dad showed up a day later. We told everyone we were trying to BBQ and the wind must have pushed fluid on my shirt. I went to light it and accidentally caught my sweater.

She was 16.\n\nOne night, some guys were being grabby on the sidewalk so my sister goes to walk in the street to avoid them. Then she gets harassed by a lady cop demanding she walk on the street or get a ticket.\n\nMy sister paid her no mind, and the lady cop wrote her a ticket.\n\nMy sister proceeded to ball it up and throw it on the ground. The cop told her that she was now under arrest.\n\nWell my sister ran, and the cop pursued. My sister is quick, and put on a Barry Sanders like move and shook the cop. Eventually scales a fence--with a piece of NY style pizza folded in a paper plate *in her back pocket*--and gets away.\n\nShe goes back to the hotel room, changes her shirt and puts a hat on, and goes back out into the night to party.\n\nShe eventually bumps into the same lady cop, makes eye contact, and another chase is on. This time the lady cop calls for backup and they catch my sister.\n\nShe gets booked into the Daytona police station at like midnight. Around 3am I am awoken from my drunken coma to the room full of my friends, all with very serious looking faces, and one of them hands me the phone.\n\n\"It's for you, it's the cops.\"\n\n\"I don't want to talk to the cops...\"\n\n\"They have your sister...\"\n\nOh, well then.\n\nCop: \"Hello, is this spiegro? Could you verify your name and birthday?\"\n\nThey tell me they've arrested my sister, for jaywalking... After I ask \"are you serious?\" They hung up on me.\n\nI go to pick up my little sister, and when they finally release her she is absolutely defiant... Shouting back at the police station on our way out.\n\nShe told me the whole story, and we finish the trip without many problems.\n\nWhen we get back home, my dad is there to greet us. Asks \"so how was the beach? Anybody get arrested?\"\n\nCue me, my sister and all our friends nervous laughter... He didn't find out about for months until the summons to appear in court came in the mail.",

I went to the optometrist and he said that my eyes wouldn’t focus(because I would just unfocus them at the appointment). We’ll, I got my glasses and realized they were a huge pain in the ass. I lost a few pairs would get in trouble. They were also hideous. I got the same pair as my friend and they looked like 70’s dad glasses. I don’t know why I picked that pair. The events that happen after was the most messed up part. \nI didn’t want to wear the glasses anymore and an opportunity presented itself. My mom had a man from my church that would give me a “blessing” and that might heal me. I saw this as a chance to finally be rid of them. I can’t remember if it was directly after the blessing or a while later, but I said I was healed. My parents were so happy, my mom told the story to everyone that would listen. A while later in their life they got really religious and I thought it was partly because of that “miracle”. I couldn’t tell anyone. \nThe first time I told anybody, was my wife about 3 years into my marriage. It felt so good to get it off my chest. She laughed so hard, because she had heard my mom tell the story multiple times and knew my predicament. \nThere were a few times where my mom would tell the story and my wife would just stare at me and try to make me laugh. We would laugh so hard afterwards.\nOne time, while my family was all together, my mom started the story of how I was miraculously healed, I stopped her and decided to confess the whole thing. Everyone was speechless. After around 25 years I finally told the truth and it felt amazing. My mom didn’t know what to say, but she is pretty easy going and was able to laugh it off.

My parents knew the dad that was there as I was a friend of both of their son's for a long time. My folks just assumed that he parented like them; as in being there watching us, being available to us if needed and emotionally caring etc. However, they were **wrong**. \n\nHe was like a ghost as he ran a programming business up the street and was barely ever home. He was also a closeted bi-sexual and cannabis smoker which made him very avoidant of his family. Honestly, I've learned as I got older and reflected, he was a very neglectful father. However, at that time my friends, their neighbors that were the same age as us, and I had a blast basically having complete freedom and lack of adult supervision for literally **years**. Needless to say, we were definitely up to no good a lot of the time. It was almost like we lived in an Ed, Edd and Eddy world...\n\nOnce in a while when my parents would pick me up, they would speak to the father if he happened to be around the property. He wasn't a big fan of conversation, and would just tell them that I was a good kid and he likes having me over. However, he said that because he would litterally pay me to do both his son's chores and his yard work because according to him I wasn't \"a lazy piece of shit, like them [his boys]\" \n\nUnfortunately this isn't the happiest story deapite all the fun and feeedom, as both of these boy's grew up to be very mentally and emotionally troubled and didn't really develop coping skills, as their parents were absent. As much fun as it was, knowing how it all ended up; I wish it didn't happen. However, I guess wether I was in the picture or not it would've been the same...\n\n**TL;DR** : Never told my parents that my friends house that I stayed at for long periods of time during my childhood was an unsupervised free-for-all where I got to do basically anything I wanted at any time of the night or day and was paid by the paternally absent father to do his kid's chores, which actually ended up ensuring he kept up the image of adult supervision to my parents.",

We used to play together, take a bath together, etc. when I was 10 and she was 14 her body developed pretty well. She was a slender and tall and she was curvy in the right parts as well. Her butt was curvy and thick her boobs are also well developed despite her petite appearance. It also helps that she was super pretty, I mean guys of all ages are looking at her everywhere we walk.\n\nAnyways, we used to sleep in one bed together and one night, while sleeping, she moved and tossed too close to me that we now in a cuddling position where im the big spoon. Her butt is grinding through my dick and left hand is stuck under her boobs. It was my first boner and sexual experience. I couldn’t resist, so I just grinded my dick in her butt until I came and fondled her boobs all night. Luckily she is a heavy sleeper and didn’t wake up from all that.\n\nEver since that night, I routinely molested my aunt every night for 2-3 years. I groped her butt, fingered her, grinded my dick on her clit. Some nights when she gets too close to me I also kiss her in the mouth and suck her tounge. There was this one night tho, where she move so much that her head was my waist, i thought myself that this is too risky, but it is probably my only chance to do it. I took my penis to her mouth and  jerk off until I came, luckily she didn’t notice the next morning.",

My cat is the only good thing in my life, the only thing that never left me, never judged me, always loved me unconditionally, and never made fun of me without giving a damn about my feelings.

Then as he started getting better my mom almost died. I got raped. My friends all abandoned me bc they couldn't handle my shit or the way I responded to it. I got into drugs. It was fucking rough. \n\nDuring my junior year of high school I was on a trip with a club I was in. We went halfway across the country and we were largely unsupervised bc our chaperones were useless. We went to a theme park the day before we were due to come home and I decided that I needed some souvenirs. Problem was, I didn't have the money. So I decided to steal what I wanted. I of course got caught and was banned from the theme park. The chaperone who \"handled\" me was the dad of one of my former friends and holy fuck it was rough.\n\nWhen we got back, the teachers who led the club and the principals decided that I wasn't allowed to be in that particular club any more. I was devastated. I swore up and down to my grandparents and my mother that I hadn't done it. They all went to the school and raised hell and eventually they decided to allow me to stay in the club but I had to give up everything I liked about it (I had been in leadership and I was on an elite squad for competitions). I lost the scholarship I was supposed to get because it was dependent on my participation in the elite squad. I lost the few friends I'd made in that club because word of what I did got around and nobody wanted to associate with me.\n\nMy grandpa was friends with one of the teachers since they'd been in high school and went to church with him since I was a child. They snubbed him every time they saw him for over a decade because they thought I'd been severely wronged.  When my younger sibling got to high school and joined the club, my mother treated those teachers like shit. She basically told them to fuck off at every opportunity.\n\nLast Christmas I finally admitted that I'd done it. When my grandma asked me why I finally told them the truth, I said it was bc the statute of limitations was up so they couldn't ground me any more. They all took it really well (my grandma actually got a kick out of my \"statute of limitations\" comment) but they told me about how they treated those teachers and holy fuck I felt bad. I've since gone back and apologized to them and explained. Thank god the teacher who had been friends with my grandpa for over 50 years was incredibly understanding and he and my grandpa have picked up where they left off. I had no idea until last Christmas that their friendship had been impacted (I honestly never thought about it) but I would've never been able to forgive myself if a half century friendship had been broken beyond repair because of some idiotic bullshit I pulled when I was 16.",
