            "text": "To preface, I‚Äôm a girl. When I was 20/21 I fell hard for someone 7/8 years my senior. He had all the connections where I live, knew EVERYONE‚Äôs dirt and just the general do‚Äôs and dont‚Äôs of navigating your 20‚Äôs. We connected physically lol, and in-between moments of severe dysfunction there was something I saw, something I felt‚Ä¶ (even tho this guy was approaching 30 when I was first able to drink and definitely in that headspace). \n\nBut this is about ‚Äúthe guy (I) told him not to worry about‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt understand the mind games, the hot and cold, the sex being the only thing linking us together‚Ä¶ over time (about 5 years on and off) I dropped all expectations and was just dealing with what I was familiar with. I cared for him, and there were some reasons to explain his at times cruel behavior, but I knew as I got older we could never get\nany more serious than we were.\n\nHe‚Äôd always been unreasonably jealous, controlling, did his best to isolate me from people who ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù normal early 20‚Äôs behavior so he‚Äôd know I didn‚Äôt do what I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to. He even tried come between my male best friend and I, because of his last gf who had him almost put into jail (they still texted and DM‚Äôd and Kiki‚Äôd tho lmfao) cheated on him with HER male best friend and he found out and caused a scene. When I wouldn‚Äôt let him tell me what to do anymore he‚Äôd just say mean, slick comments to disparage me from doing what he didn‚Äôt want. I stopped caring. It just got old. His favorite line was ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just date _____. HE likes you, he loves you so much. Go date and be with someone who actually likes you!!!!!‚Äù Like, his words.\n\nHe always wanted to have sex but had no other level of real ‚Äúavailability‚Äù in his words. Not for me emotionally, too exhausting to get the GF title again and again so I stopped climbing. Pulled up to get my pussy eaten and have sex because that‚Äôs what he seemed to want lmfao, and that was what was best about us anyways. \n\nMy best friend and I are/were super super close, I‚Äôll give him that. Best friends since 7th grade, met my parents and grandma, I know his family, same hobbies, there for each other THROUGH the worst shit so I can get being a little intimidated. But he had no intentions of doing right by me and made my age the reason (even tho we hung like SO‚Äôs and fucked like SO‚Äôs lololol). I wanted validation and approval and love from him so bad, but it always just missed the mark. \n\nFor his own reasons, X could not connect with me or really anyone in a meaningful way and he had a habit of punishing others because of that. I got deeper than most because I was naive, and maybe he just hated that easy closeness we had. I was always there for my best friend (him too) and I put our much better and fulfilling friendship first because we were just modified FWB‚Äôs at best. \n\n\nWhen I was still intimate with my Ex, I didn‚Äôt have other sexual partners. I never went after his friends, and hanging around my BEST friend quelled the anxiety and uneasy feelings that had built up\nbecause of our dysfunction. This person who always had ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not available to be your bf‚Äù talks with me was blowing up my phone, demanding why I went downtown to smoke and play video games all night with my friend and didn‚Äôt hit him up. For what? To get backhanded compliments and get fucked again? My life improved substantially when we just stopped this. \n\n\nWell. What happened with me and the guy I told him\nNot to worry about? We will be married before his December birthday this year :) I‚Äôve seriously never been happier in my life and it took a lot of solitude, bad relationships and so much growing up to see I‚Äôm never going to meet and connect with someone like the best friend I‚Äôve always been blessed to have. \n\nI‚Äôm not perfect, my Ex was the first relationship of that kind I ever had and I learned really unhealthy ways to survive in it and process my pain. But, I‚Äôm on the other side now, and I‚Äôm completely grateful this person who was so bad for me could see that when I opened up and diverted my healing and energy to this relationship, I‚Äôd never entertain anyone else again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL; DR: I‚Äôm a girl who ended up in a situation-ship with a guy close to a decade older than me. Very dysfunctional aside from sex, he hated my male best friend and always assumed we had a thing behind his back. No, we were just the best friends to each other we could be (and I needed the tough love and hard dose of reality after being in an emotionally abusive relationship, he never sugarcoated or pussyfooted around the hell I‚Äôd put myself in). After him ‚Äúinsisting I leave him the fuck alone and date my friend who obviously loves me,‚Äù it took a few years but I took his advice and have never, ever looked back :)",

But then he started constantly comparing himself to me. \"Oh, your boyfriend does x? Yeah, I used to do that, but better\" kind of stuff, which made her a bit suss. Then started asking \"doesn't your boyfriend mind that we're spending so much time together?\" about them getting a coffee together like once a fortnight between class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer response was basically \"why would he care?

Fun couple of months with outstanding sex. She seemed like everything I had ever wanted in a person until she suddenly just wasn't. I'd never felt so close with a person before and having her just change like a light switch into what felt like a stranger was shocking and strange.

They're married and have a kid now.

I am 6'7\" tall and was not a happy guy. Neighbor put in for a different dorm. Never saw either of them again. That girl is now my wife of 16 years, and the mother of my children. Told her I did this about ten years ago. She never knew before that. She was like \"yeah..he just stopped showing up\" Ayep. And no, she never invited him in. You know when another guy has been around. You may fool yourself, but deep down..... You suspected. Guy was a smoker. Would've been obvious.",

            "text": "She‚Äôs his problem now. Or was.\n\nShe was on and off with this guy for years. She cheated on him a number of times. He was the ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù her family hated. Her family was well off and she wanted to do her own thing. She co-signed on his truck, her dad loaned him $10k for the down payment on a house, he lived at her parents place for a while, slept with her cousin, etc. He‚Äôs a dirt bag. \n\nShe wasn‚Äôt so great either. She had a sense of entitlement. She just did what she wanted. She was smoking hot though so I didn‚Äôt care. \n\nWe flirted a lot in college and then once we graduated, we never talked. I saw her on Tinder one day, swiped right, and then a few weeks later she matched with me. \n\nWe both admitted we had crushes on each other and we should go out on a date. We had a great time, and went on a few more, eventually became exclusive. She had a FWB prior to us getting back in touch. She told me she wanted to stay friends with him, just because he had a boat. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of that, but she‚Äôs an adult. \n\nWe were great for almost a year. We were in love, talked about moving in together, our future, etc. Then one day we were at a wedding and she was showing me some pictures of something. All of a sudden her FWB texted her, and it was a dick pic. I asked why the hell he‚Äôd be sending that, and she told me he gets drunk and randomly sends her shit. I couldn‚Äôt get mad at her for some dude being a jackass, right?\n\nWell, the next day I was leaving to go golfing with friends, and she said she‚Äôs going to go out on his boat. I finally drew the line there and told her I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with that. Told her she‚Äôs an adult and can do whatever she wants, but to go on someone‚Äôs boat who‚Äôs sending you unsolicited dick pictures when you‚Äôre in a committed relationship was a shitty thing to do to someone. She ‚Äúagreed‚Äù and said she wouldn‚Äôt go. I ultimately think she did go. \n\nAt one point after this she told me how proud she was that I was the only one she hadn‚Äôt cheated on. I told her that‚Äôs not something to be proud of, but again, she was super hot and I didn‚Äôt see the screaming alarm to get the fuck out. \n\nThen her ex, the one she had while we were in college, randomly messaged her. He apologized and said how wrong he was and that he wanted to be friends, and a whole bunch of other shit. She let me read it, and I laughed and said he just wants to get back together. She didn‚Äôt think so, but wanted to meet with him to see what he had to say. I got pissed, she got mad, and we got in a fight over it. \n\nWe started to grow distant, I was starting to be always pissed at her, she wasn‚Äôt talking to me, I was miserable. At one point I told her I don‚Äôt know if this is working. She invited me over that night for dinner and to talk. We had dinner, both talked about what was bothering us, we loved each other, needed to be better, etc. You know, all that bullshit. Then we went and hooked up. I started to notice something though. All of our pictures were gone. I asked her about it, and she told me she was upset and couldn‚Äôt look at them. Fair enough. \n\nWe went to bed, and I woke up to a messenger notification from that dudes friend. He gave me a heads up as to what was happening and didn‚Äôt want to see a random guy get into the crossfire of their toxic relationship. \n\nSo, no, that wasn‚Äôt the reason. The day she decided to go meet up with her ex to hear what he had to say? He went back to her place to ‚Äútalk‚Äù. It was a massive betrayal. I was hurt. I didn‚Äôt want to believe it, but I had to find out. I grabbed her phone and went to the bathroom to see what went down. I found out how bad she was lying to me. She was sleeping with both of those guys behind my back. She told them we were apart months ago. I felt bad for going through her phone, but fuck her. She must have hidden our relationship status on social media so no one could see. I grabbed my shit and left at about 4 in the morning. She woke up, asked where I was going, told her I was going home, I knew about the other guys, she told me I was being immature, I told her thanks, and left. \n\nShe called me crying, saying she fucks everything up, etc. I tried to give her a chance (I was stupid) and she completely destroyed me over the next few months. \n\nThen all of a sudden her ex moved in. \n\nSo yes, when someone says ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to worry about them,‚Äù depending on the circumstances you may actually need to be concerned. \n\nTLDR - he apologized for being shitty, she let him move in, broke up with me but forgot to tell me. She was really good looking so I ignored all of the red flags and let myself turn into a fool",

She was able to throw everything in one go. That was 3 yrs ago and I still can't get over the feeling that I had that time. I can't focus on my possible relationships with the girls that got interested in me because I can't shake the feeling that they'll do the same shit. Don't get me wrong I got over her and I'm happy for her relationship with him although it took some time but the feeling? Nah it's still heavy.",

I fucked up a previous relationship by being overly clingy and insecure so I left it alone, besides she never did anything to make me suspect anything, it was just my mind being a dick.\n\nHe was gay, didn't come out until a few years ago.\n\nSecond guy, after many of her friends moved cities and she often didn't have anyone to hang out with, she started using these meet up apps to try and make new friends, group things, like \"Young professionals in <your city>\" where 30 odd 25-35 Yr olds would meet up and network and potentially make new friends.\n\nThis one dude churned out of the group, she said he seemed nice, I didn't meet him all that often but they would hang out 1 on 1 outside of the group meet ups. Again, my mind is an asshole so I wondered even though I had _zero_ reason to think anything other than friendship.\n\nHe turned into a douchecanoe, standing her up, cancelling at the last minute, generally being a shit friend. So she stopped hanging out with him. Never saw him again.\n\nShe has several \"new\" (its been like 5 years) friends from that group meet up, one dude I've made great friends with myself as we shared a load of interests.\n\nSo in short, the guy I shouldn't have worried about, I totally didn't have to worry about.",

Dude lived with his mom, no car, no job, but he sometimes managed to catch free rides to a local ‚Äúpro-wrestling‚Äù circuit where he played a heel vegetarian villain taking out meat eaters or some shit. I couldn‚Äôt fucking care less. Should have known something was up when she all of a sudden started loving WWE. Was weird but I wanted to support her interests and even took her to a show as a gift. Anyway, she moved back in with her parents to ‚Äúfocus on herself and her studies.‚Äù Turns out she had actually moved in with the dude and his mom. Parents lived a decent drive from the college and she had a dual lie going saying she was staying with me to them and them to me. Long story short, all of this came about when I got a random call from a girl who I didn‚Äôt know asking if I knew my gf of 4 years. Apparently, according to this stranger, my gf was a ‚Äúcreepy stalker‚Äù of THE dude who happened to be this stranger‚Äôs bf. She wanted to let me know my gf was obsessing over her bf of 2 years and would show up at his work and other typical stalker shit. I‚Äôm just like funny you should say that cuz your boyfriend is my gf‚Äôs creepy stalker that shows up at her work and won‚Äôt leave her alone. We were both being cheated on, she had even found my gf‚Äôs stuff at his mom‚Äôs house (duh she was living there). However, he had told my gf that his actual gf was his creepy stalker for years. So my gf didn‚Äôt know he had a gf. The girl shared the past two years worth of her birthday, anniversary pictures with me to send to my soon to be ex gf who claimed that they weren‚Äôt real and that I was ruining her life by exposing that she was beating cheated on (while cheating on me?). I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôve ever been angrier at someone‚Äôs selfishness than I was in that moment. She couldn‚Äôt accept that the dude was lying to her for years, just like they were doing to us.

She literally, after I saw her holding hands with him near my job, said, \"You have nothing to worry about, he's just an old friend.\"\n\nOf course, to try and seal the dirty deal, she wanted to have sex. I wore a condom, which she noticed (I never had with her before that). While she was in the shower, I found all the stuff she had started to accumulate in my apartment and packed it into a box, which I loaded into her car. She didn't notice until the next day, and called crying, apologizing and admitted to cheating but \"it was just that one time...\"\n\nI told her, \"I understand, and you're right, I have nothing to worry about. Farewell, good luck and don't call me ever again.\"\n\nShe ended up coming into where I worked (let's just say it is a big box electronics store where I worked as a mobile IT tech) with him one day, shiny ring on her finger, etc. I sicc'd our LP people on them out of spite, but it turned out he had stuffed a few MP3 players into his backpack. They married, I was told. I graduated college, moved away with my much hotter future wife, and started a successful career as a network engineer in cybersecurity. \n\nWhen he went to prison for some theft-related scumbaggery, she called me (she had gotten my number from my grandmother, who I never told about the breakup). He \"beat her, maritally raped her, threatened to pimp her out, slapped their child, cheated on her and stole from her parents,\" she said.\n\nI let my wife listen after her initial greeting and thought I had the best line for when she finally shut up for a second, but my wife, in her perfect Dublin accent, cut her off and said, \"Well, then! Seems to me you've done a fine job of building a wonderfully fecked over life f'yerself. Call him again and I'll tear yer eyes out, you absolute wagon. We're happy and he doesn't miss you one bit, hoor.\"\n\nThe wife hanged up on her, took a moment to block her and report her number as spam, then smiled and gave me a kiss.",

My dumbass actually thought he was a cool seeming dude (we had mutual \"friends\") and she started with \"is it okay if I go over his house to hangout since he is on house arrest this summer?\" \n\nAs naive as I was,I didn't want to be that \"controlling\" boyfriend so I ended up allowing it. I dont know if she ever went or not....from my perspective she never went.\n\n\nFast forward to a few years later we have a kid. He is now one and a half. I live with her in her parents attic (because we had a kid). I am feeling like the relationship is straining due to the lack of sex and almost complete lack of interest she has in me. The romance was quite dead. I never was one to go through her phone...but a week or so earlier we were drinking and she gets a message on Twitter from him. The notification pops up and she swipes it so it goes away. After I already saw his name pop up. I casually say \"open it.\" She refused. I thought that was shady. But Let it go....so one day while she was downstairs with her family she left her phone upstairs. I see it. Go straight to her Twitter messages and swipe. Barely reading any of it. They were sending pictures back and forth. Most of her I never even recieved (she never really sent me nudes or risqu√© photos). That was All I needed to see. I didnt want to know the details of it. To save myself from the hurt. \n\nOne comment she made to me when I asked her about sex was \"...idk. I get really horny once you leave to work though\"  now it makes sense. \n\nFast forward to 6 months after we break up/ I moved out. She insisted she be there for my sons first time at Disneyland. I gave in and let her come. She hands me her phone while she gets on a ride so I can record her on the ride with him. I do it for about a minute. Go sit down because the ride last a few minutes. And a message from him popped up as im holding her phone. Just looked at the conversation to see whats up. And lo and behold a message a few days/weeks prior along the lines of \"what would've happened if we went to my house?\"\n\nWhich gave me further confirmation in my actions. Moving out/leaving her. \n\nNot to mention one time at a house party in my neighborhood he was there and she conveniently went to the bathroom at the same time....I saw it coming a mile away.\n\nBut alas.

I was staying with my dad in the town I grew up in for a few months. It felt good after a year of being stuck in a shithole town with my mother.  \n\n\nOut of nowhere from a few towns up where I had lived a year this guy named Jamie who she knew from some religious camp started calling her. He wanted to hang out with her so they went to the theatre. I can't recall how I found out but he really wanted her and at the time was a bit bigger than me and in good shape. He took her to the movies 'as friends' and he had a really big friend with him named Bill (think overgrown simpleton)  \n\n\nWe found his car in the parking lot and in it was a few letters that told the truth; he was trying to get with her and she wasn't telling him no. I decided he would be driving with a flat tire so I let the air out of it and went to wait for the movie to get out. When they were coming out he was trying to grab at her hand but she was hesitant. They all saw me at once and he came over to threaten me. His bumbuddy Bill grabbed me by the neck and picked me up and was getting ready to drive me into the ground (I was not fully grown like this over saturated human turd was).  \n\n\nOut of the theatre comes half of the people I grew up with including 3 brothers who 2 would later be found guilty of murder (separate and years apart). All I heard from these guys were \"Hey motherfucker, he's one of us, you better put his ass down\". These guys towered over Bill, were black and were into sports, drugs and lifting.   \n\n\nSo later on that night as I was fuckin her snatch I was giving them all the middle finger. He may have been someone to worry about down the road but she moved across country a month or so later. He let go and RAN. Also didn't hurt she gave completely up on being friends after like 70 people or so told them if they ever showed up again they'd end up in graves.  \n\n\nNow I'm married to a magical gal who I think walks on water and she has never strayed at all. Still in love 20+ years later",

Her screen saver was pics she downloaded from her digital camera. Then I see it, a photo of a dude who I thought was me (the other guy and I looked a lot alike) but then I noticed it wasn't me. At that point I waited for her to be done with her shower. Confronted her, she made a lame excuse. We broke up, as suspected he was just using her for sex and once she realized that she tried to come crawling back. I basically laughed at the idea. We had the same circle of friends and she started to date a different guy in the group, he asked me about to make sure I was cool with it. I was like Shane, go ahead man but it's gonna end badly.

He had a habit of showing up like once or twice a year and trying to get with her then disappearing again from what she had told me before.\n\nI met my wife within a year of splitting with my ex.

It was frequented by military personnel as it was also close to a base. She became friends with the guy I wasn‚Äôt supposed to worry about and ended up cheating on me with him. It went on for months. She broke up with me and I only found out about the cheating later. Fast forward like 9 months and he gets deployed. He was killed in Afghanistan.

IMO just a POS who wanted his married life and also to fuck a college girl. \n\nLast I checked, he is still working in the same area and life is going just fine. His kids were like 3 and 4 and this was back in 2015. So they are probably around 10-11 now. I didn't feel like I should tell his wife for the sake of his kids. I know if I had told her then, I was going to feel guilty over it and I just couldn't bring myself to do it. \n\nSo I've been waiting for these kids to grow up. Then I am going to reach out to his wife and let her know what he did in 2015. Hopefully, she will have already known and they worked through everything and had a happy marriage.

A close friend in my department had already confided in me about both of those guys, telling me they basically both played games with her, and I relayed this information to my ex when she told me she had started talking to them.\n\nI at least respect her for breaking down and telling me when I told her over my birthday dinner that I was ready to reconcile things, but we never did end up back together after that. She's quiet now on social media though I know she ended up dating him for at least a year. I have no idea what he's doing, and I don't really care. The pain from just continuing to exist at that job with all those people drove me to get a much better job, which I then held for four years before getting yet another better job that more than doubled my income. I'm also with someone amazing now. \n\nI hope my ex and the guy she told me not to worry about are happy in their lives, whether they're still together or not. We were young and young people do stupid things. I learned a lot from her, including what red flags I really need to be wary of, and I've grown a lot since then. I'm sure she has too and I hope she learned from what she did and recognizes the pain she caused, but I also hope she is able to forgive herself and be a good partner for the right guy at the right time.

It is **absurd** to consider.\n\nApparently she stayed with him for a year after the second time around, or thereabouts; and this was way past the time of, ‚Äúhey we just met, it would be weird to invite you‚Ä¶‚Äù early days stuff.\n\nStraight up you‚Äôre my roommate and have  erotomania.\n\nAnyway, she moved across country and is married to someone else. I know most of what I know because every so often she checks in with me one way or another, in what I eventually realized was an attempt to feel better about herself by me, hopefully, being in a worse place (her mom is a train wreck and the daughter watches Hoarders to have schadenfreude-by-proxy since she can‚Äôt critique her beloved mother).\n\nI finally took up ballroom dancing, did some international competitions, got the attention of who compete in dance - feel free to imagine the physical differences between someone who dances 8 hours a day, 7 days a week vs someone more typical in IT. Also, if you haven‚Äôt seen messaging response rates on dating sites for women pre 25 versus post 25‚Ä¶ she went for an ego booster when she turned 25, around the time I was dating models.\n\nI got married to someone unrelated to those worlds (I mean, we met at dance but she was an absolute casual), and have an 8 year old kid.\n\nAnd, all the while, any time she asked for advice, I gave her my good faith best. I‚Äôd like to think we are both much better off then if we‚Äôd stayed the course.\n\nHomeboy is, to the best of my knowledge, still single.

Instead there was a mutual online friend who ended up stalking her.\n\nit should still be in my post history earlier this week, but I mentioned , maybe in askreddit, the side effect of having a gf with 5,000 friends in her profile. I said among them are a non-zero amount of socks and stalkers and socks of stalkers.\n\nWell, the stalker was a mutual friend who kept video chatting with her once a month and pining after her. He had at least two sock accounts I was able to sus out so that if he ever got a FB time out on one of them he could use the other to spy on her FB wall - all 3 were mutual friends of hers. All from this online FB community that we were all a part of (how she found and hit on me)\n\nWell she told me he was harmless and not to worry about him. I'm pretty confident so I didn't care, but eventually when he realized I was dating her, he dialed it up to 11/10 - one time he drove to her state, uninvited, and messaged her that he was nearby. Another time, he made a sock account *of me* and started messaging our mutual friends. When that didn't work he doctored up a bunch of PMs (or he made sock accounts of multiple people to avoid it looking like a photoshop) where \"I\" was saying all manner of disturbing shit.\n\nOne time where he pretended to be me, he posted a blueprint of her home and made it sound like I was telling online friends about the layout of her house (???? what does this accomplish?)\n\nBasically my ex said 'don't worry about him' and he started hard core stalking her. He's also got a bad rap of harassing other girls in the community and as far as I know, nothing came out of it. I quit the community and went offline for over 6 years now and for all I care there's a sock version of me shitposting nonsense that he controls, since nobody is going to call him out on it.\n\nAt the worst, my ex thought to ask a cop friend of hers what she could do. That's it. I hope he got bored of bothering her when I deactivated my account and took away the source of drama in his life, but I put that entire world behind me. Not worth the hassle.",

It would annoy me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about him‚Äù she would tell me. After digging around, I come to find out that her ex was doing time for killing somebody while driving under the influence. \n\nOne day, I had a terrible feeling in my stomach. As if my soul was telling me to leave. I feel terrible for doing this but while she was in the shower, I went through her phone. Her Facebook had plenty of messages with this same guy, who is in prison. She has been sending him nudes and they‚Äôve been sexting for months. I broke it off that exact day. I made a scene in front of her family as I couldn‚Äôt wait to for a ‚Äúbetter time‚Äù to talk about it. For months, she tried to get back with me. She even proposed that we get an apartment together. Fuck that. \n\nYears later, I was told that she reunited with her convict boyfriend after he was released from prison. It only lasted a year before they broke up I guess. Today, I‚Äôm happily in a relationship of 6 years with a true loving woman. It wasn‚Äôt easy getting this far with the trust issues I had from my previous relationship but it‚Äôs true what they say.. a heart break only makes you stronger and also smarter. You just gotta learn sometimes to trust your gut and that you can‚Äôt change people. She was sexy as fuck, but dumb as a duck. Think with your brain, not your dick.",

After her spell had worn off (she dumped him), he made sure to do the classic and buy me a few beers one night, and tell me that he and I were in the same boat and that we really dodged a bullet there!  At the end of the night, I finished my beer, and told him that he took the bullet for me, and I hope it fucking hurt.\n\nTL:DR - Rambling about how getting dumped for a mutual friend kicked my ass for a while, but it kicked his ass for a lot longer, and I got to rub it in his face after drinking beers that he bought me.",

Xbox parties almost every night, phone calls etc. Tells me not to worry, he‚Äôs not her type and she‚Äôs loyal. You know how it goes. Week of Christmas comes around and she tells me she wants to go see family and friends out of town. Okay, no worries. She moved here for me last year, and skipped the holidays. So it made sense that she‚Äôd wanna see everyone again. Bought her the plane ticket (we‚Äôd agreed I‚Äôd stay so I could see my family for Christmas too)  and said have fun. Later that week, Christmas Day, I wake up to a text message saying she had never intended on coming back, that she‚Äôd spent the whole week fucking that friend she said not to worry about (told me in detail what they did ü§¢) and to send her her shit she left behind. \n\nI did not send her her shit. I‚Äôve talked to her twice since then, and as of October of last year Now she‚Äôs engaged to a completely separate person that she‚Äôs been dating for maybe 6 months, buying a house and moving to Kansas. \n\n\nFunny thing is, after our breakup I realized I was part of a pattern. She‚Äôd move across the country, date a guy for a year and a half (every time it was always a year and a half) and then dump him and move back home. I can only imagine this relationship will go swimmingly too. Blocked her after that last interaction. So I‚Äôll never know",

I told her I wasn't comfortable with her seeing this guy, and reminded her she'd made me stop talking with a female friend a few months prior because she felt threatened. She begrudgingly agreed to stop but I found out later she kept on seeing him.\n\nShe broke up with me and immediately started dating him. She called me a week later furious that the guy had told her that he was going to start working on a serious project for the next 2 years. He wouldn't have time for a regular girlfriend but was down to continue seeing her for an occasional hook up. She wanted us to get back together. \n\nShe made another effort to reunite with me about a year later. I brought up the cheating and she denied that had ever happened. She claimed that whole incident just never happened. I asked her why we had broken up, and she \"couldn't remember\" .",

I ask him if he‚Äôs still in love with her and he said yes. But I‚Äôm not suppose to be worried about that? I wasn‚Äôt worried cause he was disgusting. I wasn‚Äôt about to do more than having a weird date with him. \n\nI obviously won‚Äôt be seeing him again, not because of the ex but because he‚Äôs kept wanting me to basically replace her. We are the same ethnicity and tbh I sense I am way cooler. So his obsession with the past instead of seeing the present was mind numbing.",

One day while visiting her mum snapped at her for constantly having guys in her room... suffice to say I was confused. It turned out her ex had been over but she was adamant nothing had happened (what can I say she was the hottest girl I ever got with, my dick was doing the talking). \n\nWe eventually broke up for unrelated reasons but I later found her Ex had gone with her to a festival and they'd shared a tent. We'd also overlapped in our respective relationships for around 3-4 months.\n\nA couple of years later I was working in a local pizza joint and a new guy started working there. Turned out he was the 'new' boyfriend. After quizzing him I'd realised we had also overlapped by 4-6 months. By this point I didn't want to be involved in the drama so kept my head down. Keep in mind over the last two years she'd been sending me nudes while drunk and flirting with me when we bumped into each other in the local town when we were out drinking. She'd also kept trying to take me home, but by then I had an on off thing with her best friend (which admittedly she was ok with..... how nice of her).\n\nFlash forward two years and they break up. I then find out she had done the exact same thing to him. Now she was dating an old school friend of mine that I no longer spoke to. Turns out she'd also had a brief stint as an escort (or failed dominatrix depending on who you speak to) and she'd also had an affair with a fireman while dating my old friend. However before she could end the relationship she got knocked up and decided to stay with the school friend. I'm still curious if the kid is his.\n\nThis is why I'm so happy to have moved away from my home town!",

(yes that‚Äôs exactly how she said it too) well the guy took that as a sign that she was screwing him and flipped out on her accusing her of cheating before ending the relationship. She later called me crying about it before stay up all night on the phone flirting with me.
