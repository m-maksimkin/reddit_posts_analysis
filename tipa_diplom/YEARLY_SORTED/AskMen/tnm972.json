Add in them being cry bullies and you got a minefield of bs no matter how well you handle yourself. \n\nSometimes it comes down to how they treat you vs they would other women, and things can just get so emotionally charged. When it comes down to it they can talk like they dislike how rude other people can be, but be totally bloodthirsty without a second thought. All the while treating you like a monster for stepping a toe out of line. Just so much of \"rules for thee, but not for me\" going on. And it just makes it seem like they are bogarting  the communities for some of the stuff you like and just doing the same exact stuff they talk about hating men doing.

She was in a really bad place with her life and herself, and I guess I was the target of her anger and self-hatred. Knowing this doesn't make it hurt any less, but sometimes my anger and hurt turns into pity and that is a much more manageable feeling. \n\nSome of the worse ones had to do with sex. At one point, she was getting frustrated because I wasn't open to intercourse (I didn't feel emotionally safe/wasn't ready/was afraid of anything going wrong/she was being controlling and manipulative and I wanted to feel in control of at least one thing. Oral sex and mutual masturbation was still a thing, though). Long story short, she said she said she felt sexually frustrated, which, by itself, might seem be an understandable complain. But I think she was being very pushy and manipulative about it, she wasn't very understanding with me, as that was my first relationship and I never had any sort of sexual contact before. I also voiced some discomfort about one experience in which I felt she was a bit inattentive about consent, and basically she made that complain about herself (same way as when, at one point during sex, I lost my erection and she made it all about herself). Anyway, later on I felt guilty and I also felt pity for her, so I actually proposed buying condoms from a vending machine, but the machine was broken. So we went back to her home. Eventually we started getting sexually involved and then, she says: \"you know about that thing I said earlier? I was lying\". I felt depressed and just stopped the sexual contact, and she asks, seeming completely focused on her own needs \"why are you stopping?\"\n\nKeep in mind this was the following day after a mercilessly toxic night phone call in which we were arguing till 7 am and, Im not sure if this is what she actually said or not, but I got the feeling that she said \"you're shit\" during that phone call. I was not sure, and it felt like such an outlandish thing to say I assumed I heard wrong.\n\nBut the most hurtful thing she did was not anything thay she said, it was the silence that hurt most. Feeling hurt, broken and deeply harmed by this person, and the fact that she never attempted to repair the hurt and damage she caused me. I know I hurted her too, but I keep wondering if my guilt is warranted or not. I keep wondering if that guilt is a sign that I wronged her, a lingering sign of the emotional blackmail I received, or both. It's confusing, and I feel broken and lost without knowing who I really am.",

She was super smart, and one of the most creative people I have ever met. And she had a great sense of humor. Problem was that we came from very different backgrounds. She came from a really stable home, with two parents who had good earnings and very little drama.\n\nI on the other hand came from a very poor family consisting of an extremely alcoholic single mother and a drug addict brother. I was the most mature person in our household for as long as I can remember and had to take on adult responsibility at a very young age. I was always embarrassed by my family and never really dated because I didn't want to expose anyone to the shitty parts of my life. But this time I went for it because I liked her so much.\n\nSo we started dating. Initially hanging out at friends houses and in public but as things went on we need a place to hang out alone. Her parents were strict and I wasn't allowed there without them around, so we started hanging out at my place sometimes. But only when no one was around my house.\n\nEventually my mom overdosed again and I had to put her in rehab and this allowed me and the SO to hangout at my place all the time. Things were going really well, but eventually she became suspicious as to why she had never seen my family. Or why I never spoke about my family or any part of my past that relates to them.\n\nIt was around this time that my mom got out of rehab so I invited my SO over one time to meet my mom. I knew it wasn't going to be good but I thought I should just show her what my life is actually like. Well my mom was wasted and was belligerent. My mom didn't even let my SO speak because she was babbling. It was a struggle to get my mom to bed but after I did, my SO told me that she felt like I had tricked her. That I had hid all this darkness from her until she was emotionally invested. Before I could respond I heard my mom take a hard fall and I rushed to check on her. By the time got my mom back to bed, I came out and saw my SO standing in the doorway about to leave, and that's when she turned and said it.\n\n\"I think less of myself for being with you\"\n\nAnd then she walked out\n\n2nd edit: This was over 15 years ago when we were both very young. I hold no animosity towards her. She had valid reasons for feeling the way she did, but she chose to express them very poorly in an instance of duress. Everything always works out.",

Were heading back with some friends to one of their dorm rooms afterwards to hang out and watch movies as a group, but I figured I'd pop over to my room first to get changed out of formalwear. As we all got into the elevator together, I started to ask about something, I honestly can't remember what (this was 20+ years ago), but nothing even remotely related to what she apparently thought I was asking, as she VERY loudly and indignantly/disgustedly proclaimed \"NO I AM NOT INTERESTED IN DATING YOU.\"\n\nAbsolute mortified silence for a couple heartbeats, then mercifully the elevator door opened and I got out on my own floor.\n\nYeah, I know, tame compared to most of the stories in this post most likely, but for a whole slew of reasons, not the least of which was that I had been trying to sincerely and honestly maintain a friendship in spite of my known feelings, the tone and volume of her statement in that setting was incredibly hurtful.\n\nI'd like to say that I had the self-confidence and self-esteem to stand up for myself afterward, but nope. I was a self-loathing coward and basically just let it go. I don't think she ever realized how much that hurt me.\n\nI've dealt with far worse things at times since then, but as far as \"what's the meanest thing a woman has ever said to you\" specifically, that incident stands out.",

I already have extremely bad anxiety that stems from having this done to me since I was like 9 years old. When I get left out on purpose, it hurts worse than almost anything in the world. I thought things would get better as I got older because I thought people would mature, but it's still just as bad as it was in high school. I just turned 31, and not even a few months ago I was ostracized and shunned by a group of girls at this social gathering my friends invited me to. They made it so painfully obvious and apparant, that some guy I had never even met before came up to me a little later and told me how bad he felt for me. \n\nI just hit my 2 year alcohol sobriety mark. I have seen so many other people, especially women, make milestone posts on FB and get a lot of support. I made one in the alumni group on Facebook for the treatment center I was at. Only one person even said congrarulations, but over 100 saw the post. It's been up for almost a week. I also made one on my own FB wall, and once again aside from my few male friends, no one cares. \n\nIt's so difficult to live like this, and if anyone has ever wondered why the suicide rate for single men in my age group is something like 4 or 5 times higher than anyone else's, welp, there's a reason for it.

            "text": "A little set up; doing Russian Studies at university, meet a few Russian exchange students and one of them is *unbelievably* attractive.  We hang around a little, she comes to a birthday meal of mine (but leaves early) and she \"borrows\" a tonne of my things because we share similar interests, we then go to the Welsh coast for a day out together, but whilst there looking out over the sea she suddenly says \"You want to be alone, I can tell\" and stops talking to me entirely.  I don't hear from her for a few days, so I go to her flat to talk to her.\n\nShe's just in a dressing gown when I knock, but invites me in anyway. I tell her how beautiful she is to me, and ask her what she's thinking...\n\nShe starts ripping into me, saying a lot of things that I've thankfully forgotten in the face of the earthquake to come, mostly about how terrible and boring I am I think.\n\nAnd then she says \"I'm a woman, and I've got my needs too. Come here, stand next to me\". I do. She points into a mirror, where we can see both our reflections, and says \"Now can you ever imagine any woman honestly wanting *that*.\" Meaning me.  I'm stunned, and don't know what to say. She then says \"Turn around, I'm going to go fuck an actual attractive guy, I want to dress up for him\". \n\nShe's between me and the door, and in just a dressing gown so I'm terrifyingly aware later of how badly she can make this look if I push past her, although I'm just frozen in the moment in the moment itself. I turn around and hear her getting dressed. I can still remember the sound of her sliding silk underwear on. When she's done she says \"Now drive me to see him\".\n\nWouldn't it be nice to say I got her in the car, and drove her off campus and dumped her far from anywhere. That's how it would go on Reddit in a modern retelling. People would clap too. In reality I was still in shock, and I just dropped her off near his block.\n\nShe stayed with him for a little while after returning to Russia I believe, then married someone else with money who paid for her to do another degree back in the UK. As for me, she told anyone I knew that I was an easy mark, and to steal from me because I wouldn't fight back; I found out because one person she claimed it too warned me she was doing this, which gave me enough anger to process and go see her once more and demand my things back. \n\nIf you've ever seen the monologue about being traumatic realisation being as if shot with a crystal bullet in Apocalypse Now, it was that kind of feeling, and has stayed with me forever. The complete disconnect with the joy you imagine in your heart, and just the sheer nastiness that you can't see that lies just beneath the surface.  I comment above about attenting a rape trial; that was the same year. And there was more besides. My time at University was often *miserable*, yet it's supposed to be the greatest time of your life. \n\nBut in a way, I'm grateful I met her, because it taught a valuable lesson about the need to ignore your own feelings and identify and survive undeserved viciousness. \n\nI won't say I'm perfect now. It fucked me up for a very long time. But I know what I'm not. And I'll never treat a woman like how I was treated myself.",

She drops the bomb on me.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I love you any more.‚Äù\n\nThis, of course, was absolutely devastating. It was completely out of the blue. Things were fantastic leading up to it. This woman is the love of my life, and to hear her say those words through tears absolutely shattered my reality.\n\nI removed all of my belongings I had at her place, we took a bit of a hiatus. And one day nearly after we decided to have a candid discussion in person. To communicate. \n\nWe laid everything out, with the promise that we were not to get offended, and take everything the other has to say in stride. Things we like, and more importantly dislike, about the other. It sounds harsh, but truly that was the single most constructive conversation I‚Äôve ever had in my life. She laid it on me, I laid it on her. Shit I did that she didn‚Äôt like, shit she did that I didn‚Äôt like. We weren‚Äôt asking each other to change, but we weren‚Äôt going to be complacent about things we were certain we didn‚Äôt like and wouldn‚Äôt put up with.\n\nShe had asked that we take some space, during which she periodically came to me for comfort during the period of uncertainty. I told her, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not going to help you leave me. This space is for both of us, not just you. I will respond to you when I am ready, I‚Äôd expect you to do the same. You wanted this.‚Äù\n\nShortly thereafter, we reconvened and expressed that we both in fact wanted to stay together. \n\nThree years later, here we are, planning our wedding, living in an apartment together with a home office, and our dog. We‚Äôre both progressing in our careers, and things have genuinely never been better despite the rocky period we both endured three years ago. \n\nI‚Äôve never held any animosity towards her for expressing how she was feeling in that moment. She was uncertain due to our difference in ideals (mainly religion, she‚Äôs Presbyterian and I‚Äôm Agnostic). I was uncertain after she dropped the bomb on me, due to her indecisiveness.\n\nNow I‚Äôve never been more sure of anything in my life that this is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.

I love my kids, they are great and mean the world to me.  It hurt every time hearing that; I couldn't understand it.  Not once did I ever regret it.   I thought she must love them and she's saying this just to hurt me because she knows how I feel about our kids.  She'd say other evil shit too but her regretting our kids always hurt the most.\n\nIt would turn out after we divorced her sister told me that  she regretted having kids, so it wasn't just to hurt me, she was telling other people - that really makes it worse.   We had kids because she demanded them, she decided when we were having them, everything was her plan.\n\nAnd then in divorce she tried to keep them all from me.  Which she horrifically managed to do because the courts have insane bias.   After a year, my sons are on a plane to live with me because she can't handle them.  BUT I haven't seen my daughter in 10 years, despite endless attempts, despite social services totally being on my side, despite doctors being on my side - the courts aren't on a father's side ever, or kids - because my sons haven't seen their sister in 9 years.    And get this, I'm a stay at home dad, i arranged my tech career so I was always home, i make my own schedule and only ever worked when my kids were in school.\n\nIts so fucked.  When my daughter was born, she wasn't allowed out of the hospital until my ex wife agreed to hold her.  It was severe.  She didn't feed them, i did all that.   So yeah, I knew my wife had mental health issues,  she was on meds even while pregnant with our second.   i was supportive throughout our marriage.  I didn't even seek divorce, she did.    It wasn't until out first born that she became such a disaster - she changed, getting worse with each kid.",

Honestly just getting it out and telling someone things that have been on repeat in your mind feels good. That being said, I felt a real connection with this girl I had been talking to for a while and it was well reciprocated. One day a lot came out about my anxiety and depression & general stuff going on. She responded with, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre both broken, we can‚Äôt date‚Äù. This happened 2 years ago and it has really left a scar as I‚Äôm even more conflicted on sharing personal things.\n\nI had previously been in a relationship where she was very open with her struggles leading to me constantly being the ‚Äúrock‚Äù and did my best to help her in anyway I could because I loved her. Eventually it built up and all came out near the end as I could not hide behind the smile anymore. That‚Äôs when the comments like, ‚Äúyou used to be‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúsince when did you get anxiety or panic attacks?‚Äù As if I was lying or untruthful.\n\nAfter that breakup I had gotten a call from my friend one night very late telling me he couldn‚Äôt believe the things my ex was saying about me at the bar to people. I hate even bringing this up because given I am a big, generally athletic guy and have gotten myself in tough situations before from just being the biggest person there as people seem to automatically assume you‚Äôre a threat and I feel like I need to justify myself more then I should which in turn makes me sound like I‚Äôm guilty of something ugh it‚Äôs frustrating. Basically my friend had told me she was telling people I had physically abused her. I still can‚Äôt comprehend to this day why someone who I knew so well and shared everything with would make up something like that let alone be telling people this happened.She texted me the next morning asking how I was doing. I blocked her on everything however it still stays in the back of my mind, is she still telling people this? Do people think of me like that? It‚Äôs just so tiring.\n\nI believe vulnerability and the ability to be vulnerable in relationships is an essential foundation. Maybe because I‚Äôve lived so long trying to cast the image of everything being alright. I think there are many woman out there that don‚Äôt realize how little guys talk about their mental health. I personally am not looking for an answer or a solution to anything I am talking about, but having that feeling of a person you can talk to anything about (both ways) and it never being held against you or you being judged for it, we‚Äôre all humans just trying to get by at the end of the day.

She called some hours later to pick her up as something bad happened and she sounded very scared, only to find after picking her up that she was with this guy and told me about it, claiming:\"the guy wasn't as good and as charming as I was\", thing I didn't have an idea how to react to.\n\nBut apparently, that was a lie to cuz they kept talking and dating in secrets, until she started doing things to end the relationship so she could go with him, thing that eventually happened.\n\nToday they got married as they had a baby girl whose now 4 years old and I have learned that this had to happen for me to learn and grow, to the point I thank this guy eternally for doing what he did and saving me from ever marrying that crazy girl lol.\n\nPerhaps the funny thing is that after all these years she had the guts to hit me over Instagram chat, presuming she tried to be with me again after either something bad happened in their marriage or just wanted to play the bitch again xD\n\nSorry about the long post but this is one of many stories and things I have lived from women, but keep your chin up, these things happen for character development and growth. :)",

I remember some highlights being -\n\nI was sick the day of a field trip, my mother called it in, and had a doctor's note afterwards stating that I was unfortunately sick that day. The very next day, I was good enough to go back however the entire day was centered completely around the field trip. What we learned and experienced. Since I was the only one that never went, I was completely lost and trying to keep up but, couldn't. After asking the other person for some help, he told the teacher. She proceeded to stop and tell the entire class that \"this problem is what happens when you try to avoid school and slack off.\" Reminder, I was sick the previous day and she very much should have known this yet, according to her, it was my fault for not being present.\n\n\nWe were doing math worksheets, timed ones. Only about a minute to do as many basic equations as we could in the time on the double sided sheet. I was really good at them and continuously scored high. One day, we got one, I believe all addition, and I was burning through it. Having finished up the first side and moving onto the other as the teacher walked around the classroom to look at our progress. Stopping at me, she pauses the time before taking my sheet. Showing it to the entire class, she got their attention, wanting them to look at my sheet. Telling everybody that my sheet, my work, was exactly \"what a failure looks like and what laziness gets you.\" She thought I was barely starting despite it being the other side. Sheepishly, I informed her that she was showing the other side. Turning the page, she sees that the other side is completely filled in and was doing well like usual. All she said was \"Oh\", set it back down, and moved on like nothing happened.\n\nLast one I remember was a day that wasn't going well for me and I was beginning to get a bit emotional over something. I don't remember what I do remember that just started to cry. Taking me out of the class, she essentially had me against the wall and proceeded to scold me for crying. Telling me to \"Stop being so emotional and crying over nothing.\" That if I kept being such a \"crybaby\" the boys in higher grades would treat me terribly so I needed to \"act like a man and starting toughing up now or things would get worse\" She told me to get to the restroom to clean myself up before heading back inside like nothing happened. \n\nThat's most of what I remembered about her. I have a few other stories but, these three fit the question. Suffice to say, I did not like this teacher at all and she forever affected my performance in school as her words and actions laid the seeds of self doubt in me.",

Seems like a good fit right? \n\nWe start talking, sext a little bit, we plan to meet up, then the guy she wanted to date all along takes her out and she drops me.

Honestly, being used as an option didn‚Äôt really bother me because‚Ä¶ I get used as an option a lot‚Ä¶ So whatever, maybe we can reconnect as friends, we used to be great friends. (It‚Äôs been about 5 years since college at this point) poly is about accepting people who they are and building a relationship or whatever type as it stands. In fine with this. \n\nFast forward about two months and she gets dumped. She‚Äôs living in this guys apartment and calls me one night to be a sounding board. I realize she‚Äôs being used- badly. So, naturally I‚Äôm thinking move her out as fast as possible and get her away from him. (In hindsight, her love mapping is *fucked* up and I didn‚Äôt know. 20/20 folks) \n\nNope, she keeps trying to fuck her way back into his heart while living with him for a long time.

She needed to get out. \n\nThen ehe starts sexting me out of the blue, 1st night in her new apartment and I‚Äôm getting sexts the next morning at work with no warning. I‚Äôm not okay with it. She just went through all that breakup fallout and I am not looking for rebounds. So I try to tell her to stop gently, if she wants to date in the future fine but she needs to be on her own for a bit and get her head on right. \n\nThree days later- bootyhole over my morning coffee. \n\nI tell her to stop.

That she was using me for validation and my usefulness was gone. She would go onto the next guy. That men are ‚Äúobjects for women to use on their walk in life.‚Äù \n\nThat stuck with me for a couple days. It really would have fucked me up if my amazing partner hadn‚Äôt reminded me what healthy happy women are actually like. :( it‚Äôs sad.

I told her no and I'll walk her to a cab because she can't stay in my place.  She breaks down crying telling me how she met a guy for a date that night, went back to his place and he allegedly forced himself on her.  She undresses and tells me I can do anything I want with her as long as she can stay the night.  I told her she needs to go to a hospital and report it to the police.  Naturally, she got angry, asked why and told me I don't \"give a fuck about her\" (true!) and to \"stop being a pussy.\"  Told her to gtfo before I call the cops.  She finally left and then blew up my phone with texts calling me homophobic slurs, not a \"real man\" and topped it off with the alleged rape gaslighting.",

            "text": "So I'm going to list two events here. The first is the meanest thing a woman has said to me, the second is the most hurtful, but not necessarily mean.\n\n1: \"I know who's getting deodorant for Christmas **this** year!\"\n\nIt was hurtful, but I got over it pretty quickly. I lived with multiple chainsmokers and a bunch of cats at the time, so frankly you just couldn't wash it all off.\n\n2: This one requires context.\n\nThere's a woman that I dated for several months, but we had mutual feelings for several months before that, and for about a year-and-a-half after the breakup. For some nebulous reason I thought she was the one; don't know what the hell I was thinking. Anyway, we went camping with some friends and her dog was a fucking menace, constantly barking, and at one point he saw another dog (he's aggressive to other dogs) and snapped his leash. This is because the woman in question thought he \"didn't have enough room to roam,\" so she attached one leash to the groundspike and clipped another leash onto the handle of that one. Needless to say, he snapped the damn thing and I had to sprint after this big, scary, leggy boi and restrain him for everyone's safety.\n\nThis pissed me off, but I bottled it until I got home because I didn't want to be a dick about it. Couple days later, she calls and says, \"That was a lot of fun, we should do it again!\" I was like, \"Oh yeah, but maybe next time without the dog haha.\" Like, he's a sweet pup but he doesn't get enough exercise, he's not socialized with other dogs, and he's a dumbass. Anyway, she took exception to that, and we argued. Basically, she shut down or ignored everything I said because she, \"didn't like my tone.\" She was raising her voice on the phone and getting very upset, while I was speaking slowly and deliberately specifically so I wouldn't get very upset.\n\nAfter that interaction I'd kinda had enough of her shit (she was manipulative and abusive, just didn't see it) so I texted her the next day to say I'm coming by to drop off the books I was borrowing from her. When I got there and she answered the door, she looked at me like an alien or something. Very tense, kinda pale like she was scared of me. I just handed over her books and stood there awkwardly for a second before saying, \"Bye, I guess.\" and walking back to the car. She texted me as I was leaving, asking if I wanted to talk. I said sure.\n\nSo I come back and we sit outside her apartment and chill and talk it out a bit. I'm thinking, \"Hey, things are looking up, maybe there was just a misunderstanding.\"\n\nHer: \"If I tell you something, will you promise not to be mad?\"\n\nMe: \"I can't promise that, but I'll be mature about it.\"\n\nShe then pulls a knife out of her pocket and said she brought it along because she was scared after our last conversation.\n\nI am a big dude, but loyal to a fault, and I'd known her for a couple years at that point; she'd basically become one of my best friends. I would **NEVER** hurt somebody I cared about, period. Straight up, as soon as I realized she was incapable of trusting me I lost all interest. The implication that I would harm her over that petty shit hurt way more than any abusive nonsense she'd spewed before it.\n\nSorry, this became a word wall. It's been almost two years and I'm still healing from that woman.",

He was in the newspaper every week for football and in texas, football is king. When we became sexually active he didn't want me to take anything bc he didn't want me to get fat and not be hot anymore. Well I got pregnant our senior year. He told me if I had the baby, he would be mine and he would never have anything to do with it. I thought after I had him, things would change. Yeah they did but for the worse. I was working full time, had to put my son in daycare while I also went to college full time. He on the other hand, was out drinking until 6 or 7 am EVERYDAY with the money his mommy gave him. She would come over EVERY DAY  to see if the apartment I PAID FOR was \"clean enough for him and to make sure I had cooked for him, done his laundry and all my womanly duties were done\". Did the bitch ever offer to help? No and on top of that, she was one of those fake holy rollers so she would go through my closet and take out clothes she didn't like, cut them up, leave them in the sink with bleach with a note saying they were the devil's clothes\". She would also come over and steal my son's clothes, pampers, wipes and even BREAST MILK bc she had another granddaughter who was 2 months older than him whose parents were drug addicts and in and out of prison so my apartment was her Wal-Mart. Soon after, my ex and I started getting into explosive fights where he began physically and emotionally abusing me. 1 week after my c section he hit me so hard and so many times the whole incision opened up and I had to be rushed to the ER and taken into emergency surgery. I ended up with a scar that looked like freaking Harry Potter. I put up with that shit for 7 years with him telling me nothing was as good as his mom's until finally one day I said \"if nothing I do is as good as her, why don't you go fuck your mom and see if she will suck your cock and swallow you fucking bitch\" of course that earned me an ass beating. But the worse of all, was towards the end, I had quit having sex with him and he spiked my drink with the date rape drug so he could have sex with me in the vagina while his brother took me in the ass. The next day I was still on the floor of the bedroom with my panties down and blood everywhere. He told me that's what I got for being a bitch and the next week I found him fucking an underage girl in the bed I PAID FOR. I finally understood what they meant about seeing red. I wanted to kill them both but it was finally the kick in the ass I needed to leave the bitch for good. So some girls do abuse men but sometimes men do things to women that a woman could never do to a man",

We worked together, hung out one night, there was definitely some mutual attraction but she broke it off reeeeeally quickly afterwards, but insisted she still really wanted to be friends. I was crushed but went along with it, but never really got over my affection for her. Anywho, few months go by, I ask her to my prom, she accepts, and me being the naive idiot with little to no female experience that I was, I allowed myself to thing that this meant she was starting to like me again.\n\nI spent all of prom night grinding with her, trying to kiss her, thinking I was on top of the world. Go figure, when we all got in the limo and left prom, everyone was heading to an after party, she said to me in the nicest way possible she wanted to go home. Again, me being stupidly naive, I didn‚Äôt see why.\n\nAnyway, about a week or two passes by, but she just talks to me randomly about one of her ex‚Äôs, a drug dealer, and we got into a huge argument about it, how I thought that was really stupid of her to date someone like that. She said it was not my business, and then the arguments got really personal from there. Long story short, I called her a cold hearted bitch, and she replied with that she only went to prom with me because she felt sorry for me, and that she wanted nothing more than to yell ‚ÄúGET THE FUCK OFF ME‚Äù the entire night, but she held back because she didn‚Äôt want to embarrass me in front of my friends. \n\nWe had several rounds after that of making up, arguing, making up again, and then eventually just stopped talking to each other altogether. It was mainly my fault. I just never got over liking her until maybe my sophomore year of college (yeah, it took a while) and every time I saw her I was constantly reminded of being rejected, and it made me so sad and mad at the same time, so that played a huge part in how I acted towards her.\n\nI don‚Äôt hold any real animosity to her today, this was fifteen years ago, and I was a stupid, ignorant, naive kid who didn‚Äôt know what he was doing. She could‚Äôve made things so much worse and scarred me for years but she didn‚Äôt. All water under the bridge now. If we saw each other on the street, I‚Äôd say hi. Wouldn‚Äôt be much else to say, but I wouldn‚Äôt avoid her. She was a nice girl who just had to put up with my bullshit.",

I never knew how to court a girl üòÇ, only teacher I had who could teach me was Teacher GOOGLE üòÇüòÇ, it said to impress and court a girl give her chocolates...\nNow here I am with no source of income or anything, used to walk 8km (whole trip) to school, then walked 5(km) to Tution so I can buy her DAIRY MILK SILK everyday saving the money I get for Bus... There came a day when all I had was spent too, I even resorted to steal some money from parents which I regret till date...\n\n2. I only told my 1 best friend \"Bro I like this girl, I feel like how good it was if I could talk to her or be with her, it'd be a dream come true\" ... This bitch had be so fast that within 5mins my whole class knew, another 5 mins whole fkin section of 12th class knew including science stream commerce stream and, 12 mins later the girl herself now knows there is a boy who likes her and it's the same boy who borrows her notes üòÇ frequently.... God pls don't say I'm stupid coz borrowing notes was only thing I knew was way to come in contact with a bio stream girl üòÇ...\n\n3. She now knew I like her and I'd give her chocolates everyday for next 2 months .... One day she told me other girls in her class are making fun of her saying that she is using me for chocolates,and we discussed and now stupid me actually started giving her chocolates now by passing it to her bestie....\nPerhaps I thought its time where I should confess but felt like I stutter in front of her and maybe I can express it in writing so I wrote my feelings on an a4 sheet she, now had 3 of those sheets and submitted to Principal and Congratulations guys thats how I was fked \n\n4. I didn't realise when I walked back to home but I felt it was way too tough to breath, there was like something stuffed in heart but it won't come out it hurted too much and continued to hurt for next 3 years all my friends alienated me now I was same guy but I had no friends no-one to talk to life was very tough as sometimes I felt like wtf I was still living for..\n\n5. I tried talking to some adults I knew but they all were like wtf is this childish bullshit it's nothing just go and focus on your studies you are 16yo now grow up\n\n6.

I once had a girl to my left get my attention because she wanted me to pass her friend on my right some candy. I tried to get the attention of the girl to my right. She was ignoring me. I was trying to tell her that the friend wanted to give her candy... still ignored me, so I just grabbed the candy from the other girl and just put it on her desk. Girl took her pencil and pushed it to the corner like it was an infectious rat. I got angry and just grabbed it and tossed it in the corner of the room behind us. \n\nLater on in the class room the rude girl was trying to get my attention, she tried to apologize and say she didn't know the candy was from her friend... (Mind you I had told her that several times). She then asked where I put the candy... I told her since she didn't want her friends candy earlier I threw it across the room and pointed to the corner behind us. She went running after it to see where it landed. I never talked to her again and didn't accept her apology.",

I'm keeping the money too because you were horrible and abusive and if you ever contact me again I'll block you\" which came out of nowhere.\n\nThe abusive thing struck a chord with me because when I'm changing meds (happens every 3-or-so months) my moods do become unstable but I tend to shut down and lock myself away but when pushed I become argumentative, and boy was she pushy as fuck, didn't respect my boundaries etc. so I kicked her out of my place a few times (she didn't live with me) but she knew it'd hit me hard because she was also incredibly spiteful.\n\nTold her to go fuck herself and that she's a horrible, hate filled person.

After a few seconds she changed back to her previous warm persona and apologized but I was pretty mad at that point and told her 'Alright well, fuck you too then!'\n\nWe spent about 20 minutes talking on the bus before that and the time just seemed to fly by. The next few minutes we spent avoiding eye contact with each other and the other passengers seemed liked it took years in comparison. \n\nShe reached her stop, got off the bus and we never spoke again.

She would always say something mean to me and when I got hurt by it she would just say something like \"I can't even say what I think without you getting mad\" (most of the time I was just sad but she saw it as mad). I was always a patient guy but sometimes I had enough of it and I defended myself. When that happened she would be like \"You are so mean\" and make me feel bad about it and constatly brought that up when we were fighting. When I tried to tell her that she is behaving the way she is she would just say \"That hurt\" or something and again make me feel bad about it. She would somehow make me feel like I was the bad one. I wanted to breakup with her many times but I just thought \"What if it gets better? I'll never know if I break up with her now.\" (she told me she loved me and stuff). Finally when I realised she was cheating on me, I had the balls to break up with her. We've been together for 1 and a half years. Even after breaking up with her I thought what if I was the bad one? This is how manipulative she was. Over a year later I have a new gf and when I started dating her I realised that my ex was so fucking horrible girlfriend. Like how did I \"survive\" for 3/2 years? I always didn't want to talk bad about my ex because I heard that it will just make you look bad to talk shit about your ex. But I realised that it was meant for non-toxic ex. So fuck it. She was a fucking bitch and I am glad that I am not with her anymore. I feel bad for anyone she's dating rn. Cuz he will end up tha same as I did.",
