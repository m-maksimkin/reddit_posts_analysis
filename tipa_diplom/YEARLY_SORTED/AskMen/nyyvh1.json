Hell throw in a second \"w\" if you have to!\n\nLast you're gonna need to add some suffixes.  You can't go wrong with roman numerals.  Bigger IS better! Nobody gives a fuck if you're \"Andrew the second\", that just sounds like your parents are alcoholics who didn't love you enough to come up with a new name.

If I saw someone creating one I would assume that they are fragile because one, you don't need to assert dominance over others & two, its generally the men with issues that believe that sort of thing.\n\nFor instance, many men believe the trope of being the Alpha Male, based on the idea of the alpha wolf who dominates & leads the wolf pack. But in reality, if you were a wolf & acted the way men do who believe they need to alpha everyone, you'd be exiled from the pack.\n\nThe fact is that a wolf pack does have social order, & the lead position is considered the alpha, but there is an alpha male AND an alpha female, & neither of them rule the group, they are sort of elected in some ways & in some ways they naturally assert themselves. But the pack lives, hunts & raises families together. The female wolves will raise the pups together, they hut as a group, they protect each other.\n\nI mean, I get it, when I was young, I thought the same thing, I had to be the toughest, most fearless, dominant male in the area. And instead of being cool & well liked, I was feared & disliked. But signatures were not what decided those things so this seems extra silly to me because its both bad form to try to dominate everyone but also funny that you think a signature will make people think you are whatever it is you think dominance means.",

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.
