The ones that hit me most were the “you have baggage, what do you have to offer?” As if I’m not an entire person. With a personality. And likes and dislikes. Interests. Etc. Again, I understand not wanting kids, but not all single moms are used up garbage. (That is my only negative experience)\n\n2. Men are so sweet. Lol for the most part, I can’t really see what is “wrong” with men. Yes, of course, there are some off hand comments, but for the most part, the men in this sub seem really great. \n\n3. Men don’t grow up. Who they are at 5 is who they are at 50 lol it’s adorable \n\n4. Not all men expect women to do this or that. For instance, I’ve seen so many men comment about respecting women’s boundaries and even stopping sex because it didn’t feel right for some reason. It opened my eyes that who I was with doesn’t respect me at all sexually. I genuinely thought all men had the “it’s mine” or “if I’m with you I deserve it” mindset. I appreciate anyone who opened my eyes about that.\n(*#1 is a result of #4. I let someone get me pregnant because he made me think I was wrong for not wanting to yet, or that I wasn’t being honest and loyal to him.

Which is kinda sad like why can’t they reach out to anyone or find someone and then there’s the other extreme like a man married and loves his wife but wants to cheat.

A lot of explanations that make more sense when I hear them articulated from a man in as good of a place as he is and echoed here.\n\nThe most damning is how lonely men are. Not as a mental illness but as a norm. It bothers the hell out of me how often my friendly disposition is treated as flirting when, if and when I flirt, I'm direct because I don't care to waste time and spend my life with someone I'm meh about because I wanted to sit around with my thumb up my ass instead of shooting my shot. It makes sense now. Men, my partner included, aren't used to a woman being just warm and friendly to them without intent and it's sad.\n\nI don't know who is to blame. As a woman from a small town, I've gotten myself into dangerous situations in the city because I'm stupid friendly and I've armed myself with caution as a result. I don't feel like a bad person for not being personable with every man who wants my time of day. I don't have enough time *in* the day and I am past the point in my life where I feel responsible for macro problems while I'm trying to buy a sandwich.\n\nAnd men being afraid to cry around their female partners. Why? How is this a thing? *Crying is good*. It's a healthy emotional release. Why wouldn't I want to listen to my partner's problems? Why wouldn't I want to sit there and be like \"yeah fuck that guy\" with him. I can't believe that any sane women complain about men not valuing their input but don't want to sit there and listen to him and discuss things with him that he obviously cares about enough to feel some type of way over. \n\nI've been in healthy relationships and I've been in unhealthy ones and I can't imagine a healthy relationship with a man who can't confide in me and cry with me or to me. I believe him and, by extension, y'all when y'all say it's a thing and I'm profoundly disappointed in my fellow women for setting this standard.

This was so heart breaking to see recurring in the comments. I often see comments about women asking their men to open up and being upset when they don't. I have seen the outcome to some men opening up like that to their SO and sadly the women and everyone around them are so conditioned to think men have to be strong they felt repulsed by their partner exposing themselves.

Not only is it less likely that you’ll be accepted for doing that, but you don’t have a lot of experience in it, so you’re less likely to do it gracefully and you’ll probably have a bad time. Women have had way more practice, and we know we’ll receive the right kind of support for that from our friends and other women in our lives. Men don’t necessarily have that guarantee.\n\nI used to get so angry at my partners for being emotionally unavailable at the beginning of relationships (or for the entire duration!). I showered them with every kind of affection, compliments, care, etc. and opened up to them, and it took them ages to reciprocate even a sliver of emotional vulnerability. The fear of being seen as vulnerable by anyone, even loved ones, is so deep-seated, and made more painful by the desire to be truly cared for by your significant other. The last time a man may have experienced profound love to the point of embracing vulnerability was with his mother (and that’s only if he had a good relationship with her!).

I have seen the outcome to some men opening up like that to their SO and sadly the women and everyone around them are so conditioned to think men have to be strong they felt repulsed by their partner exposing themselves. It infuriated me. I see how guy friends and guy groups are so important to men because sometimes it their only outlet to let go.

I've always given out compliments to random women about hair, shoes, etc. I've now made a mindful effort to do that to random men too. \n\nMake sure to hype up and compliment my husband way more, also acknowledge his accomplishments and celebrate him. He recently recieved a raise and a bonus, I congratulated him and told him he deserves it as he is such a great worker. He takes such great care of myself and our 4 kids and he's always so hesitant to buy himself anything, so I made sure to tell him he should definitely buy that smoker he wants and whatever else. \n\nAlso letting him know that I think of him even when he isn't home or we are apart. He works 12 hour night shifts and has since we've been together(20 years). This makes for very limited time together as he sleeps during the day. So when I'm out shopping and I see something he would like I make sure to get for him. I'll text him at work just to say I love him and miss him. \n\nLet him have some of his down time alone. His job is high stress and can be hazardous work so I try to make our home life as stress free as possible for him. He has his man cave and his PS consoles and he plays to unwind. I don't bother him about how much he plays and I will even sit with him and watch for a bit. I've realized from lurking that he needs that alone time too and it has nothing to do with not wanting to be with me. \n\nSo it really comes down to I learned that men need everything women do but you all seem to be much more tight lipped about saying it out loud.

            "text": "Where to begin.\n1. Compliments mean alot to you. For me this is tricky because I am used to doling out compliments to everyone regardless of gender. I now understand because it means more for men and can be construed as attention in terms of dating and I need to be careful - still give you the compliments because you need them and deserve them, but be more clear about my intentions and that I’m just being nice as a friend\n2. Sometimes, we’re the problem. Running around spitting out empty phrases about feminism and equality without really understanding what we’re saying or why we’re doing what we’re doing can be quite triggering and damaging for men to hear. \n3. The mental health stuff isn’t fair. We need to talk about it more. It’s fucked up. We’re so focused on woman’s issues and I wish there were more discussions happening about how we raise men in a society and how it impacts them later in life.\n4. My time lurking here has shown me many of you are sensible, sensitive, rational human beings who understand basic life skills. There is a common misconception about men being useless in the kitchen, men being babies and acting like babies - I hate all that shit and lurking here has validated that many sane men exist in this world, so thanks for that!\n5. You have feelings outside of “sex sex sex”. This is probably the biggest one, most women walk around believing that’s all guys think about. It has been a breath of fresh air to lurk here and see that yes, men have personalities that don’t revolve around sex. Ground breaking😂",

Last week he was telling me about an awful situation he was in including his mean landlord. He told me he's struggled but is clean, has cut his drink down, has a good outreach worker and fiancée and is trying his best. Amongst other supportive comments, I complimented him on how good he was looking and that his fresh shave suited him. I was gratified to see his face immediately light up and I'm certain he stood taller as he beamed at me.\n\nI have been wary of how to compliment men because I don't want it taken the wrong way but I think I did ok this time, and he genuinely did look good that day.",

Also I don’t quite think calling someone tall is a compliment per se (I mean.. they probably know, get it a lot and like they didn’t really do anything to be tall?!) \n\nI also have some guys wonder if I’m sincere in my compliments I feel because I sound too casual and offhand with them because I don’t want to sound flirty then I have to confirm I’m not joking or sarcastic sigh. Or maybe they’re not used to actually being complimented, I’m not sure lol\n\nOther things I’ve learnt:\n- how lonely some men are in relationships even \n- how some men are aware of being a threat around women walking alone and go out of their way to avoid scaring women (as a scaredy cat, this was nice to know) \n- on a less positive note, I have seen a number of men less empathetic to women’s issues or experiences and play the whole “not all men” card to dismiss this.

It’s not just us women who bear that burden…and hell, at least we can talk about it and not be derided for not being “manly enough”.\n\nSince joining this subreddit, I’ve started proactively reassuring men in my life that they don’t always have to be a rock (tough guy) - that they can be a willow branch (less immovable but more resilient) instead. \n\nI’ve told my womxn friends this for years, and just assumed that guys either knew this and didn’t need reassurance about it, or that guys didn’t want this kind of reassurance because it makes them feel weak, which somehow deprecates their identity. While that may be true for some men (the ones who are likely the perpetuators of said toxic masculinity, maybe?), it’s not true for all dudes. \n\nSo - my lurking has taught me that sharing a soft moment with a male friend in crisis can be the difference between that guy being a broken “rock”, or being the resilient “willow branch”. <3",
