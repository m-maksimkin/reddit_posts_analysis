And influence everyone around you to  understand that as well.\n\nI realized a long time ago, after being in a toxic and abusive environment that I will bite my tongue until I get to a supervisory position so I can install my own morals and ethics in my crew or colleagues I work with.\n\nAnd it makes a difference. It all ads up.\n\nGive people initiative to work. And they will. But the initiative is a balanced work place.\n\nI know its hard. But hey if you can help somebody or their days in an extra way that will help them. \n\nIt is always worth it.\n\nMaybe and hopefully somebody will do the same for you down the line. You have to start somewhere.\n\nSpread the word. \n\nToday you. Tomorrow me. - I think people need to remind themselves about that classic.\n\nBe well. Do well.\n\nr/antiwork ?",

But also remember that passion only gets you a bit of time - it's pretty easy to have passion a few hours a week, discipline and much more keeps you showing up. If you did your \"passion\" full time, you'll often find out it's more of just a kinda interesting thing. \n\nMore important than what you're stating is to learn the NEXT step: you can have passion/interest/excitement AND money for a time if you figure it out. Then maybe you go back to doing it for the money because you're good at something else. All the situations can change too.\n\nLike I'm sometimes passionate about art, but I sure like to eat so I'm not ever going to do it full time - nor would I want to.

This gave me depression and dread at the idea of it, and constantly had me questioning life - aka why does everybody live like this every day when it's so terrible - why would you want to have children to make them suffer it too and increase your own work burden, etc. I started living with the thought that I would simply work as hard as possible and save it, invest it, and hopefully one day be able to escape.\n\nThen, around about a year ago, at maximum depression, when everybody was talking about wealth taxes to pay for COVID, I realised that I may never get enough money to escape, and if I do, the government might even simply take it off me year by year until I have to go back. (In the UK they were proposing it would start at £500k) I then couldn't take it anymore, but at that point had an epiphany, and now I think more like your parents do. I've been doing some acting, some handyman work, some business ideas, some buying and selling, and some share dealing. I've been learning up on languages, maths, history and cinema. I'm trying to see if I can get work on air on the local radio, and whether I can make money from setting up a podcast. I picked back up with an online degree in engineering that I started, and I'm looking for a old campervan to renovate. Basically I just started doing all the things I was actually intrigued about doing.\n\nI'm making nowhere near as much as I was before right now but that's ok because I stopped trying to keep up with the Jones's, cut my expenses and took in a lodger to make up for it. And I've surprised myself a few times with how much potential some things have. Stuff is so much more interesting and lively now.\n\nI'm infinitely happier this way. Every day is no longer a chore, but a pleasure.\n\nEdit: sometimes you have to do something you don't like to pay the bills. But if it's something that makes you miserable, this should be very temporary. You can and should be looking for other jobs as soon as you realise your unhappiness, even if the job is less money. If the job is particulalry detrimental, temporary social security is probably better whilst you look elsewhere. And you can also cut your bills. A bigger house or a nicer car simply isn't worth being unhappy every day.",

And while it was cool, only earning $10 bucks an hour while being responsible for all my own bills  was stressful. I turned to viewing work as a money making opportunity and only schemed to figure out how to make more money to relieve bill related stress. I went on to making much more money now as a programmer, which is fun enough as a job, but for the longest time I simply resigned myself to the fact that I am forced to work at least 40 hours a week to survive until I hit retirement age.\n\nExcept, I discovered that working 40 plus hours a week is not a fact, and that retirement age isn't really a thing. Retirement is actually a financial state, not age related at all. I discovered FIRE (financial independence; retire early) and was hooked on the idea that it's possible to retire from work completely in a very short time frame. That was about 3 years ago, and since then I've dramatically shifted my lifestyle so I can save as much money as possible (about 70% savings rate) so that I can retire asap. Now, I only have about 7 more years to go until my investments pull in more money than my expenses are a year, and at that point I will no longer be forced to work for money. I will finally be able to pursue what I really want to do (Japanese work and teaching, as well as some programming) at my own pace instead of being forced to work for 40 hours a week.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, jobs may be a means to the end of making money, but is it possible to become independent of a job so that you can pursue your hobbies own on your own schedule. It's not necessarily a \"truth\", as you put it, that you have to work a job just to support your passions in the evening.

The world is a big place and it has a lot of moving parts. 100 years ago most people shat into a hole in the ground, now we have this awesome pipe system that takes it away and we never have to think about it. That's possible because someone dug a bunch of holes and laid the pipes. I can guarantee they weren't passionate about digging holes, but you couldn't count the value of that work to society.  \n\nI work in the family business, so I'm lucky in parts in that aspect, but the work we do has value to society. Am I passionate about it? Not at all. Do I enjoy it day in and day out? No, but I do enjoy the overall value I feel we provide to an industry and in turn the population. Because of what we do, other industries can do what they do, and the end result is a better quality of life for our community.\n\nThat in turn with a pay cheque is a good way to spend a third of my week I think, and I find passionate things to do in my spare time.",

I've been a logistics warehouse manager, a network administrator, a radio DJ, a strip club dj, a male \"phone escort\", a licensed massage therapist, and an executive chef, among other things.\n\nI've enjoyed everything I've done over the past 30+ years, and I love learning new things. When I get tired of cooking, I'll go do whatever catches my attention next.\n\nI grew up poor as shit. I live comfortably now. Some jobs have paid way more, some have paid way less. It doesn't matter, I'm keeping up with my hobbies AND enjoying my work, even if the pay might be a lot less now than it was when I was doing some other things.\n\nWhat matters is that I enjoy what I'm doing, every day that I'm doing it. There's are thousands of different jobs out there, and I refuse to believe that anyone is ever incapable of performing ANY job, if they're dedicated to learning it. Maybe it's just because I've always been good at picking things up quickly and adapting, but I have never worked a job \"Because I have to\"... if I'm not happy, I'll find something that makes me happy, and I'll do that, and live how I want.\n\nMy current job brings in roughly 24k a year.. and I'm fine with that. I made 70k a year prior to that, and I used that money that I saved up to make sure my monthly bills were as low as possible before I started my current job, and I spend maybe 35% of my current income on bills and housing. The rest goes towards hobbies, and my job allows me creative outlet (via making specials and such) with none of the responsibility I had previously.\n\nAre there parts of my job I hate? Sure. Every job will have that. Fact is, you need to accept that not every job will be 100% everything that you love.. but if you enjoy the majority of it.. then why the fuck not do that, instead of doing something else? Absolutely NOTHING is preventing you from doing the job you wanna do.. except your own mentality and how much effort and time you're willing to invest in it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor reference, my hobbies include DnD, Writing, Reading, 3d printing, VR, painting miniatures, crafting 3d terrain, sculpting, horseback riding, camping, and gaming.  \n\n\nAll of which I can do on my current income, with my current job. Hell, I just bought a new vehicle (2021 Prius Prime) and I'm planning on purchasing a new Anycubic Photon Mono X ($650) and a Prusa I3 (Roughly $750) as well as a compressor for my air brush (About $60, so cheap) in the next month or two. I already own an anycubic photon s, valve index ( and an unused Oculus Rift CV1) with full body tracking, plus a basic airbrush and compressor, and... who knows how much in supplies for sculpting and painting... not to mention I support 13 different 3d printing STL patreons at between 5 - 10 bucks a month each.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll on a job that pays me just above the poverty line (according to yearly taxes)... because I paid off everything when I was making 70k a year as an executive chef, and saved up the rest.",

I’ve been financially independent since I was 18, and I struggled with the concept of wanting to find work I loved all through my 20’s. Never truly found it, but I found work I can tolerate. I’m closer to 40 now, and the thing that keeps me waking up every morning is the concept of using my money to fund  things I love. The better I save, the more I can fund. Trips, hobbies, dreams, whatever. For me, it’s no longer about the actual work at my day job, but continually negotiating better circumstances for the same or better pay. \n\nA word of advice for anyone working in a soul-crushing corporate environment; unless you work for a unicorn company, literally none of your superiors are paying attention to your work or your struggle in any meaningful way. To advance in your company, you simply must make yourself indispensable (not in your opinion, but in a ROI/data way), make sure it’s documented, and then use that fact as a take-me-or-leave-me negotiation chip to put yourself in a better position. If you’re good, you’ll always have the upper hand. There’s even a nice way to do this. Go read “Never Split the Difference”. Life-changing book.\n\nIf you’re not doing this, you will always be trampled by superiors who ask for more and more work on tighter and tighter budgets. At that point, you are THEIR negotiating chip to their superiors. You’re just making THEM look good. Those people are your target. Make them unable to operate without your unique assistance. The sooner you recognize that your someone else’s pawn, the sooner you’ll start making your own moves towards a better position for yourself. Take back some power instead of just following directions and hoping someone notices.\n\nThis isn’t scummy or manipulative, you’re seeking a mutually beneficial agreement with your employer to make the job sustainable for you. \n\nLastly, to be clear, I’m not some capitalist psychopath. I’m an introverted empathic artist who despises greed and the concept of the “company man”. Everything I’ve said above is how I’ve managed to survive in the corporate world while I do what I truly love after hours. \n\nYou got this, dudes. You’re gonna make it. It gets better. It gets easier. Believe in yourselves. And PLEASE, for your mental health, do stuff you absolutely love outside of your job. Make time for it. Without that, there’s no point in working.\n\nEDIT: long comment, mobile device, lazy thumbs... of course I made typos.",

Having ADHD and a god awful GPA made it impossible for me to go to a traditional college so film school sounded even more enticing. Like practically everyone in film school I had big hopes of dreams of becoming a director/writer/editor. I wanted to be the next Robert Rodriguez (ugh).\n\nI’ve been in this industry for over 10 years and I came to the realization that I’ll never have the “passion” to be a writer/director. Fine! I love the editing process so a job as a professional editor wouldn’t be so bad! That would have been great if I ever got the chance. I pretty much spent a decade being an assistant editor bouncing from gig to gig believing every boss who says “we like to hire assistants who want to edit so we can hire from within.” Which is just pandering bullshit so you’ll stay loyal to them. Not to mention the job is just a glorified coordinator and has very little to do with editing. It’s a terrible job for someone with creative visual sequencing. \n\nA 10 hour day is minimum in this industry! Minimum! The unions/guilds help with that in that you get OT after a certain amount of hours but you are still expected to work long hours. It’s all just factored into the budget. l worked 18 hours a couple months ago and it was all due to things out of my control. I’ve had countless mental breakdowns that severely hindered my personal and professional life. \n\nA month ago was one mental breakdown too many. I up and quit the same day and I honestly have no interest in going back ever. My passion is gone and I don’t need that toxicity in my life. \n\nI worked in a warehouse driving a forklift when I was 20. That is the job I want again.

Being in a job that you are not particularly passionate about but don’t actually mind doing is great because most days are uneventful and peaceful, meaning you can spend your energy on doing things you actually love. I also find that being around people who are too ambitious can be a recipe for disaster because they start projecting their own level of ambition on other people, creating an environment of pressure that you may not enjoy.

Always enjoyed being independent. \n\nNow I'm a physician who works at night without the benefit of truly having access to all the consultants who are in house during the day. Every night I go to work it feels just the right amount of scary \"oh shit I hope I can handle this\" without (usually) having to test my limits to much beyond my comfort zone. It's a truly frustrating experience at times with my hospital always trying to cut costs.\n\nBut overall, it's a job I truly feel privileged and excited to have the chance to do every night when I pull into the hospital. Someday I'll be too old and my training too out of date and I'll probably have to retire. So when I walk into the hospital every shift I actually think \"okay AnimeSnoopy do your best tonight, bc you won't have the opportunity to do this forever\".\n\nSorry if that's cheesy but I do reject the premise that you will inevitably have to view your job as \"just a way to make money\". I realize how lucky I am and probably in a small minority on this issue",

Meanwhile we all busted our butt and had to prove that we were making the company money. This outfit is was run by capitalists who simply did not care about their employees. They even told us that if we even joked about unionizing we would be fired. So when I hurt my back and missed a week of work my immediate supervisor told me that if I wasn’t back by the next Monday I’d be fired. So I went to work while hurt.

Not ever. \n\nAnyway a few years later I quit that job and started my career that I’ve been doing for fifteen years. At first I was excited and was your typical tryhard. I don’t try at all anymore. The corporate nature of my company demands that our managers force us to do things while the guys at the top tell us to take out time and be safe and blah blah blah. \n\nEndgame is they hate us. They really do. They’ve taken everything from us. Used to be there were small perks that we would all enjoy. Family day at the zoo, bbq cookouts if we went a month or quarter without incident, new work boots once a year around your birthday. Now it’s all gone.

I don't hate my job but I wouldn't say I love it. To me it's just a means to an end; I'm competent, it pays alright, has good benefit, the firm culture is positive and the hours are not so bad. Can't say the same about my ex firm tho, crazy hours, low pay and toxic hierarchical structure, I stayed for 5 years because of the exposure and a great team.  \n\nI'm passionate about environment and animal conservation and advocate for mental health awareness, if opportunities arise I might consider going into those fields.

My first night working there in maintenance I ran into one of my former graduate history professors.  I was embarrassed for him to see me helping out with menial work a mere three years after giving up on that degree.  He said that most people work just to pay their bills.  I never thought of work except maybe my first year as a lifeguard as any \"dreamy experience\" but his words gave me some peace and resilience about what I was doing and the real reasons I was doing it for.",

But I'm not trying to survive off of music - its trash. \n\nIf you can make your passion into your job, figure out what that job entails and make sure you're not sacrificing everything you love to do it. I almost quit until I realized I could just get a different job and still do music for fun.",
