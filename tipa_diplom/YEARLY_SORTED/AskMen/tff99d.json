I was there once, and i could not stop eating baugettes. Did you like Paris?\" Then get the respone \"Yea\".... Ok, we are done.\n3. Only sexy pictures. They have no text, pictures of them self in underwear or close up breast/ass pictures. What can i possible write to you if we match then \"You look good, want to fuck?\" I never write that, but i dont know what they expect. Maybe promote their onlyfans... who knows but i never actually got a link.\n4. \"My child is always top priority\". Yea, as it should be. I dont have a problem with that or if you have a child.

This isn't an anti-religious thing for me, but in my experience the people who are the most loud and proud about their love for Jesus also tend to be huge assholes and ironically the most unchristlike people out there. The kind of people who go to church every Sunday and then go out to brunch afterwards and tip their waitress in Bible verses. Plus the loudly religious also tend to be super conservative in their political beliefs, which is the real dick shriveler.\n\n2. Pretty much any political statement. Even if I agree with your politics, it's a huge turn off to see on a dating profile because it tells me that you are an insufferably no fun individual who always has to talk about these things. Yes politics is important and I do eventually want to know what you believe in because that tells me a lot about you as a person and what you find to be moral or not, but I also want to know that you are a fun person to be with too, and the people who talk about politics all the time are not fun people to be with.\n\n3. Pictures of you with Children or expressing desire to have children. I am staunchly childfree and I want a partner who agrees with me on that, so don't mention children in your profile. I don't care if the kid in the picture with you is your younger sibling or cousin or niece/nephew, I don't really want to see it on your dating profile.\n\n4. A list of requirements that I have to meet in order to date you. It's ok to have standards, but keep them to yourself, all having those requirements on your profile does is make me think that you are a demanding entitled person who thinks too highly of themselves.",

It could have been that they were really that dumb, or that they didn’t care, or they did it as a joke. Regardless, it was pretty much an immediate ignore click from me, even if we matched up on other more serious things like views on marriage and kids.\n\nMy wife was one of the top two people I matched with.

This one is usually combined with the previous two. Like, you couldn't branch out and take a pic outside maybe? Get a friend or family member to take a shot? Set up a timer and take one at a distance? Change clothes between shots? Sheesh.\n\nAll travel pictures--I get you like traveling and showing off where you've been, but this isn't Instagram. \n\nAll pictures with a group of people--I like Where's Waldo, but I don't wanna play \"Is she the one I find most attractive of her friend group?\"\n\nAny mix of the above: as it is a dating app, I need to know about *you* in your *natural habitat(s)*--as in the places you are in daily, and how you look most every day.\n\nI get that you want to put your best foot forward, and make your profile all jazzed-up like a resume for dating, but it's not a resume for dating. It's a work sheet all about *you*, where the test is \"getting to know you\" and \"finding out compatibility\". \n\nTurn-offs involving their profile...\n\nWhen they put next-to-nothing.

I get that as a woman you're inundated with matches, but that doesn't mean guys won't swipe right on you just because you say that. **Remember, in dating apps you only connect if BOTH of you swipe right on each other.** Plus it's not like you can't just unMatch them if it was an accidental matchup!\n\nAny profile with some variation of reluctance--\"I'm only here because\", \"my friends/family made me do this\"--or \"I'm happy being single\"/\"I'm an independent woman\". If you don't want to search for a relationship, get the fuck off the app. Reluctance is not cute or sweet in a relationship, plus in some small way it says that you're actively trying NOT to make a connection. Also, that you give in to peer pressure from friends and family easily, which isn't a good trait to have in one's partner. Chances are that if they don't like whoever you've chosen, since you have no spine you'll just boot your new relationship from your life. \n\nSpecifically only for me: \n\nWhen she has high-school age kids... and she's 35 and younger.

At the best, it shows that you're playful. And one or two might be cute if the rest of your profile is just amazing. But for most people it screams immaturity or insecurity, both of which are unappealing. \n- **Negativity.** And I'm not talking about, \"Pineapple does not belong on pizza!\" or \"I hate olives!\" I'm talking about the people who seem inclined to use the profile as a place to rant about things or other people, or to set forth each and every thing that they dislike in a partner.\n- **Low effort.** Women can get away with it, because desperate guys will still try to match with them. But that only yields you desperate guys. If you haven't answered core parts of the profile (at a bare minimum, answer all of the default fields: race, religion, career, education, age, height, body type, do you have kids, do you want kids, and at least some of the discussion prompts). If you don't give me anything to judge you on but your looks, not only am I going to judge you on your looks, but I'm going to assume that you don't bring anything to a relationship *beyond* your looks. And I'm not interested. Similarly, if you couldn't be bothered to actually engage with the prompts, write something interesting, coherent, and with at least a little depth or wit, I have to assume that either you don't really care about finding someone, you don't really care who you find, or you lack the skills to do better. None of those are appealing. \n- **Misleading photos.** Whether the photos are old, or everything is a MySpace angle, or you are putting yourself in a bunch of group photos, this suggests, again, that you're either putting in low effort, or trying to hide something. \n- **Excessive religiosity.** I'm not religious. I'd totally date someone from just about any faith. But if your profile includes, \"Jesus is #1 in my life!\" Nope. This includes taking Astrology seriously. You want to know my sign? Fine. You read your horoscope for fun? Whatever, no problem. You want to make jokes about how you dated someone who was a classic Gemini? Uh... \n- **New England Patriots fans.** I have standards.",

I don't want any part of someone \"settling\" for me. I'm GGG, dedicated, loyal and would walk through fire to defend the mistakes and humanity of my partner. But I'm far from perfect, so if you're going to feel like you're giving something up for me, then go find someone else.\n\nIf you say that you're not a cougar and don't want any 20-somethings messaging you, and at the same time don't want anybody with any baggage or drama, then fuck you. Real people don't get to their 40s without baggage. Of course nobody wants a basket case, but I am compassionate and supportive of my partner, and I expect the same.\n\nI look like my profile pictures. I'm not ready for Playgirl or GQ -- more like Hair Club for Men, if I cared, which I don't. I'm slim, fit, strong, and think I look pretty good both dressed and naked. My idea of what's attractive in a woman is not in line with what's pushed in advertising, but I do want you to care about your general health and fitness, and be somewhat active, whatever that means. Makeup can be an attractive accessory, but if you think you need it to look good, or only have one partial-view picture in your profile, then please pass me by. If you look at my pictures and don't think that we could be each other's fuck-yes, then keep looking.\n\nI'm not looking for pen-pals. I have enough trouble keeping in touch with my current friends/family. I'm looking for someone with whom to share my life, including spending spontaneous free time according to the whim of the moment. I'm willing to make an effort to be with the right person (heck, I'm thinking of moving to xxxxxxx since that's where all my matches seem to be), and I know that lots of women my age are still raising kids that take priority. But if you're not willing to at least consider travelling to xxxxxx, for a first date, then feel free to swipe me left.\n\nDating sucks. I thought I was done with it 25 years ago, and I thought it sucked then, too. I'm here because I don't like to be alone, and I don't want to have to learn how to like it. It's not who I am. I've been working on volunteering and other social activities for the last couple years; but I'm an introvert (how about that, an introvert who doesn't like to be alone?), and trying to balance the line between just enjoying activities and looking for dating opportunities is draining. I want to experience life with my companion/lover/best friend. To all you women who only want to date men who are already \"complete,\" well, fuck you. Probably like you, I said that I'd rather be \"wanted\" than \"needed.\" But I don't want to just be your accessory, and I don't expect you to just be mine.",

I smashed a lot of damn pussy from online dating. Double digits. Stay with me...If you are looking for love...\n\nThe only three girls I ever fell in love with were ones that I had worked with and we just got to know each other and befriended each other. Those are the only ones that really interested me. I am sure the double digits girls I mentioned earlier were great people. \n\nAgain I am older and have done online dating for many, many years. Before Tinder, it was...it was a hell of a lot easier because you actually had to write message to each other. Not it is just left or right; garbage in, garbage out....so....\n\nI suggest spending your mental energy instead finding something you are genuinely interested in where you might see the same girls or women over and over again..a shared intereested...and just try to beFRIEND them. I am atheist, but church would be an example of what I am saying. You will see the same faces every week or so, and they have the cook out or volunteer things or whatever during the week where you might see them again. Not advocating church, but that is an exmple to convey my message. \n\nGet off the online dating if you really want to find love (althought the are success stories). If you just looking to smash pussy, you just have to play the damn numbers games and see what you end up with onlince dating as \n a male these days...\n\nBut, yeah....If you cant handle me at my worst you alreaddy know the ready of the quote if you have spent anytime online dating and coming across single moms who are going to nursing, maybe...red flag. not a dig on nurses or single mothers either",
