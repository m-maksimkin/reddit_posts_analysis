We are taught that we must adhere to a certain aesthetic if we want to be found desirable by men. Are there men who expect a similar standard of beauty from women? Of course. Often what we expect of ourselves is not actually because men made us feel that way entirely but our social standards have warped our sense of confidence by constantly evolving to something just out of grasp. I watched a fair amount of porn beginning as an older teen and I know it fucked with my self confidence. I now tend to steer clear of porn stars and go for amateurs I find attractive. \n\nI largely enjoyed this thread. Shout out the men in my life who told me they’re attracted to me because I’m “all woman” or a “real woman” which they meant was I’m not emaciated or I don’t look completely different after a shower. It’s one of the biggest compliments I’ve received from a romantic partner.\n\nEdit: I’m 40/f",

Bullshit.\n\nLadies. Guys do care about a lot of things. From your skin to your opinions. They will judge you. They will lie to you too. A lot of the assholes on here are straight up lieing. \n\nPersonally, some things that women are correct about what men think.\nLabias; yes. There is a reason why the whole beef jokes are popular among guys. Men judge women's sexual organs all the damn time. Look at the comments from terms of \"thic\" to their asses so they judge your labis, nipples, boobs, skin, coloration, smell etc. \n\nMen judge scarring and acne. From skin tone to dye and even hair. Funny how many guys on here never mention hair. Pubic hair or any form of hair. If a guy didn't have a problem with \"looks\" then they would not have any problem their partner growing out their armpit or body hair. \n\nA man will love you even if you look like a sasquatch. \n\nAnother one is scarring. Bull shit. Scarring is nasty and stretchmarks too. Many guys would lie. I known girls with great personalities and some great features/characteristics but because of scarring they were judged. \n\nI can go on about moles and their placements and sizes. Or the voice box of a women/laugh. Or her speech. Accent. Monotone. I have seen men reject very hot women because of their speech/accent or literacy. Even as petty as fucked up Eyebrows too because it made them look ghetto. \n\nOr How men judge SJW or strong women even docile women.",

No matter what type of girl you are, there are guys who will find you attractive. \n\nThat being said, there are also guys who will find you unattractive. Sometimes for things as simple as your eyebrows, your stretch marks, your weight etc. all these dudes telling you guys in general don’t care about those things are either blatant liars or they are basing their observations on them and their small select group of friends. I’ve worked in factory and warehouse settings, with a large sample of men to work with, and I can tell you that there are definitely men who are shallow and judge women based on looks and nothing else.",

But men hate when you overthink the sex or make it like a job. When it happens, it is best to be spontaneous, like we turn you on and you can't wait to have us. And it's great if you initiate it once in awhile.  \nMen just want you to put some effort into your appearance, but don't expect you too look like a supermodel 24/7. We don't care that much about boob size or other things, just don't become a freaking hippo, gain 50 pounds after we start dating you. Men are visual, but as long as you're not obese we can usually find something we like to look at it if you've made an effort.  \nYou'd be surprised the things a man will do for a woman if she just smiles at him and says thank you, and makes him feel like a human being. There's a lot of men in the world who walk around for days without a woman even acknowledging their existence. Just be kind, don't assume everyone who talks to you is hitting on you.  \nDon't talk about your ex for assume a new guy will be the same as the ex.

It may spark some discussion and jokes here, but it would spark far more meaningful conversation in the context of a relationship. Hell, you don't even have to be direct about it. If you see your man getting all dolled up, mention a routine or nitpick that doesn't bother you and segue into it from there.\n\nBelieve it or not (and in spite of what the instruction booklet your man came with might claim), men are not a monolith. Every single human being on the planet has likes and dislikes specific to them. Crazy ole world, innit?\n\nSo long as you and your partner are happy together, don't sweat the small stuff. You should both do what makes the other happy and to hell with the rest of it.\n\nJust as an example, my wife spends like... two hours a day in the bathroom when she wakes up. She did this before we even met, she does it for her and what she is comfortable with. Me, I'm a long haired, long bearded hairy gorilla barely disguised as a person. But I keep my pubes shaved meticulously because I find that shit vile and disgusting. Neither my over-abundance of hair on 90% of my body nor the 10% completely bald bothers her either way and she gets made up for her, I find her gorgeous with or without her hair all done and her makeup on point.\n\nJust be happy with who you are, worry about that first, and if you get into a strong enough relationship with someone it'll work out.\n\nThis is off the cuff and spur of the moment so I hope my point isn't lost in all those words. You be happy with you, all the way. The right person will be happy right there with you. I wouldn't change a thing my girl does.\n\nThanks for reading, I guess, lol.",

By the end of our discussion I was so grossed out by straight dudes and the whole mating ritual thing... I was bi curious for like, a week.  \n\nThe big thing that really had me gobsmacked was that this dude was telling me the easiest way to get a girl in the palm of your hands is to give her a backhanded compliment. He said if she wears her hair up, you say something like \"oh, wow you look great, but I really loved the photos of you with your hair down\" or vice versa. If she wears jeans make a comment about how great she looks but you thought she was coming in a dress.... or vice versa. He said the strategy is to plant a seed of doubt in their mind so that they will be insecure for the rest of the date and will end up sleeping with you to \\*prove\\* themselves to you. Since this guy basically fucked a different girl every night and was a straight up pickup artist, I assume it works. I was mortified.  \n\nAnyway, point is - a lot of guys it seems will bank on the fact that girls take their opinions very seriously and you shouldn't because they don't actually care they're just trying to manipulate you.",

Not to say we aren’t attracted to women physically, but I firmly believe there’s such a thing as “good looking enough.” In other words, you’re more than just your appearances, so if a man shows you interest initially that means he finds you “attractive enough” to learn more about you. At that point, it really comes down to your personality and your compatibility with the guy. I know both men and women get hung up on their looks and not being attractive enough for their SO. And if the relationship starts to sour people think they need to look better. 9/10 I’d say the problem runs deeper than your appearance and even if it seems like changes your looks (sexy wardrobe, get in better shape…) make things better it’s probably only a temporary solution. Being funny, kind, compassionate, thoughtful, intelligent, etc become way more important after that initial meeting. It’s like a video game where you have to give your character different strengths and attributes.

Men generally don't give a damn if you make more or less than them—all we want is an honest relationship.\n\nOn another tangent:  men generally don't want a relationship to revolve around money/income as the main focus, and instead want a more peaceful and intimate experience throughout. Unless you really just love the subject and are invested in it, conversations about money or what to do with it gets boring really fast because we normally have the ideas on how to handle it. And a lot of men can vouch that when things become tied to money, it's usually about what the woman wants out of it and no one else.\n\nLongevity in a relationship, at least to me, is more about being able to coexist with each other in every aspect via things that will last—not just temporary satisfaction. Men care mostly about peace and intimacy because we deal with more chaos than what is readily realized on the surface... and all these women out here with \"boss bitch\" mentality are the worst kind to be around, and sadly they're everywhere. It's hard to find someone who will bring and share that feminine energy with us, and maintain the peace and intimacy that we normally want.  \n\nIf you can't bring those things, then don't waste a man's time.",

She is a wonderful person in many other ways,  I've had many relationships outside of marriage (before or in between) where anal has not only has on the menu, it was usually one of the chef's specials. Just unlucky in marriage I guess.

Am I crazy, as a man, to think that this is absolutely 100% something you SHOULD care about? How you present yourself says a whole hell of a lot about a person, and I just can't believe that men don't actually care about that. Maybe they don't want to talk about it, but that doesn't mean they don't notice when you are dressed sexy af. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso the makeup comments. Why do men not like or care about makeup? if someone takes the time to paint their face and look awesome, why would that be something you don't care about? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think both of these things have the implication that the way they dress and how they do their makeup is explicitly for them. I'm more under the impression that most people want to look good and be fucking hot for their own sake / for the sake of confidence, and I think it's a damn shame that men act as though these things aren't important. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther thing.. because maybe I'm reading this differently. Are the men here saying that they don't care about what a girl wears or whether or not she wears makeup, or are they saying that they don't want to talk about it because they don't find it interesting? both of these are silly imo.

I can appreciate longer painted nails, but some overdo it and I end up wondering how they wipe their ass or get anything done over appreciating it. lol\n\nDuckface poses\n\nGiant lips\n\nMost actually prefer nice tits over big ones. Good shape and symmetrical. I hear its the same in return for dicks?\n\nTo some extent, makeup. Like, we like a decent amount but some really pack it on. That is their choice and I don't hate it and won't knock it, but sometimes I feel it must be a lot of work and a result of self consciousness. Unless that's what you like. I don't judge, but if your doing it for a dude you could likely do less. If it's for you, you do you.\n\nSome really like freckles. I can take or leave them.\n\nLittle belly isn't that bad. I like a tight 1 no doubt but I find anything in the healthy weight range to be attractive too. Also don't mind muscle tone at all. So I guess a range of bodies is attractive and not just what the media portrays. I prefer not in the overweight range and definitely not obese. But some dudes like that too so just got to find the right 1 I guess. You probably don't want to be fetishized though.\n\nMost things like ass and lip implants actually are not appealing and your natural look is better. I don't doubt someone can do it right but I haven't seen it yet. I don't mind breast implants but know some guys who hate them. Sometimes they look way better in a bra than out though.\n\nI actually really like a smart girl. I notice many pretend to be dumb. I feel sad when I see this as I don't know who told them they need to do this.\n\nI prefer no thigh gap over thigh gap. I get some girls are small framed and won't knock it but like a little meat and muscle on those bones. Saw so many girls try hard for that. I remember when my friends first showed me what it was. They seemed to like it but I was like \"WTF? Suppose to touch, no?\"\n\nNever saw appeal in high heels. Again, won't knock them but they seem like way more hassle than they are worth.\n\nNever was bothered by a short or tall woman. But I know most dudes want to at least be taller.\n\nI like curly and straight hair. I prefer straight but find both awesome. Not a fan of short hair though, but some can really pull off a pixie cut.\n\nEveryone's body has scars and stretch marks to some degree. I'll admit, lots would throw me off a bit, but not by as much as you would think. We're only human.\n\nSome really put a lot of work into fashion. If they are doing it because they want to, go ahead but don't go overboard just for us.\n\nI also really like a girl with a crude and sometimes offensive sense of humor, who finds the odd gross thing funny. I'll never be the 1st to initiate that, but when I hear it come from them it is a huge relief like were gonna have fun. \n\nI like a bit of a tomboy side. I'd rather have a girl not afraid to get dirty or have manly hobbies than 1 that is too girly they don't want to get their hands dirty. But I also have nothing wrong with femininity at all.\n\nPersonality and just being interesting and funny really does add attraction imo.",

She knows everything about eyebrows and makeup and all that. \n\nMy policy now is to acknowledge her insecurities and tell her how beautiful she is. The stuff she questions about herself is stuff I do not even think about. Nose, arms, cheeks, stomach, etc. I have not thought for a second about the things she is insecure about. It literally did not cross my mind before she brought it up. \n\nOne other thought: beauty standards change constantly. We have artifacts from thousands of years ago of cultures that celebrated obesity. Western media only started celebrating thinness in the 50s and 60s; before that being thin was not seen as attractive and had connotations of poverty. Skin tones also change over time. There's almost no aspect of current beauty standards that are inherent to humanity; most are just cultural constructs. \n\nIf a culture can find bigger or slimmer women attractive, taller or shorter women attractive, thinner or curvier women attractive, etc. then that just goes to show that A LOT of beauty is just what is popular today. This is true for men and women: my grandmother likes my hair curly and long, but my mother likes it short, just based on the ideals of beauty they grew up with. What this tells me is that individually, we all have slightly different ideas of beauty and then get influenced by the culture of our time.\n\nThe takeaway is that attraction is very individual and for any body, there are people in the world that will find that attractive, regardless of social influences. \n\nSidenote: personality, vulnerability, and confidence are also all super attractive. Most guys I know get more sexually attracted to their female friends as they get to know them, because in getting to know them better, they find things about them they are attracted to. I've heard it is the opposite for women most of the time, which is likely why guys complain about the friendzone -- building that friendship makes them more attracted but they are experiencing the opposite in reciprocation",

If their grandiose and curved and all that weird ugly painting girls do their eyebrows these days, that is highly unattractive. Lile seriously, normal hair thin proportional regular standard eyebrows please. No paint, no extensions, no fakes, no pencils, no markers, no plucking, no shaping, no coloring. Standard feminine eyebrows. Its actually something that bothers me a lot because they are actively trying and want to be less attractive.

Obviously not like, on the sidewalk, lol, but I consider it a great step in the relationship if you’re so comfortable with me that you will pee when I am in the bathroom. It means that you trust me with private and intimate things about your life and are willing to be vulnerable.

Many girls find it personally arousing to give a blow job, guess what, I get the urge to jam my face in that thing and go to town too. Take my face to the bull-riding championships and have your fun.

I won’t lie and say it worked wonders, or quickly. But I found my wife at the age of 30, we’ve been together for 3 years now and have a son. We were both upfront about what we wanted from each other, from ourselves, and where we would like to be a few years from then. There haven’t been any surprises, the conflict that does come up is quickly resolved through discussion. We work as a team, and love each other dearly.\n\nThe things I love most about my wife? Her organization, the way she plans ahead to make sure success is more likely. The way she compliments me, and still wants to just hug and talk quietly before going to bed. When she comes in to softly rub my back when I lay down for a nap. I love helping her problem solve and troubleshoot things. The way she smiles at our son and makes him laugh with funny faces just melts my heart.\n\nI started rambling, sorry.

When facing them, all the things women think about matters a lot, all kinds of social standards and the whole hell with them. So big boobs, being short, pop/rap music, no artistic sense outside of saying \"van gogh was great\", and the latest Iphone too. They could fuck their relatives if they're hot\n\nThe second type is a macro-type with basically all other men. And they, WE, literally do not give a fuck about you being this or that or however you are, because we KNOW that we are NOT entitled to tell you how you should look and how much you should like the same music we like. \n\nAs strange as it may seem, think about it for a second: not caring is caring. It is your business how you look like, not anyone else's\n\nWhy? Because human relationships are founded on feedbacks, experience.
