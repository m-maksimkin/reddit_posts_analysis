    "How do you address your partner after they're legitimately mad because you were unfaithful in THEIR dream?\nThis has happened more than once to me. Partner had a dream I was unfaithful (never happened in reality) and she wont talk to me for a few hours. I think its ridiculous and sometimes funny. How do I go about addressing this with her? We have a solid relationship and fidelity has never been an issue. Shes also never had a partner who was unfaithful either. \nNow her sister is mad at her partner because of her dream (again, no issues or history of infidelity) and a close friend of hers too is on this train. \nI've never had this dream, and even if I did, it's a dream; not real.": [

You don't need that kind of stupidity and pettiness dragging you down.\n\nLong answer: You could try talking to them and ask them why they seem to feel, on some level, that you would do that, and what you can do to prove they can relax around you. But honestly, this only really works if both of you are patient and reasonable, and if that were true, you wouldn't be getting punished because of what they dreamed up. If it's in someone's nature to act that way, then it's highly unlikely they're going to change in a long-term, meaningful way, and they'll eventually find something else to latch on to, and by then it might be even harder to remove yourself from that relationship without a lot of legal fighting.",

Let her work on her feelings on her own. Smothering her is not going to do you any good because at that moment all she can think about is dream-you hurting her.

I didn’t hold any resentment towards my partner but I know if I had kept it in all day there could possibly be some subconscious feelings of betrayal later, so I shared it with her and we laughed about it (she was a total bitch in the dream - her words not mine). \n\nThe gap in this versus what’s mentioned is, I believe, a lack of communication about the topic leading to overblown resentment due to the feeling of inadequacy/insecurity that you may not love/want them anymore. I would share a similar dream you have possibly had to show how ridiculous it could actually be, and reconfirm the fact that you do in fact want her. For example, my dream was about my girlfriend bringing an NFL running back and banging him in my apartment, but the dudes name was Ribby, that name is preposterous enough to not believe what is going on in someone’s wild dreams lol.",

It IS funny and I think there’s a place to acknowledge it, but if it made her upset you don’t want to minimize or discredit her feelings. It might not be a good reason to be angry but she is still angry, so try to talk to her about it.  You have a solid relationship, but maybe her dreams are rooted in a real fear that one day it won’t be enough and you would stray. This really sounds like the kind of fight where it is one thing on the surface but really it’s about something else. Talk to her about your relationship, how you feel about her, why you feel solid.

They stubbed their toe, they want some space, ok whatever. But this means they're not taking it out on you, not asking you to sleep on the couch...etc.\n\nAlternatively, if they are trying to hold you accountable for their own dream, or if the time they spend being mad is excessive (withholding affection from a partner can be a form of emotional abuse) you have to address the situation. You can sit down and have a conversation about it, hold them accountable for how they are handling this situation. Common relationship advice applies \"when X happens I feel Y\" is a good template for this.\n\n \"I honestly feel a bit hurt and confused by whats going on right now. I feel like my faithfulness is being called into question and I want to know if there's more than just this dream...Have any of my actions or behaviors made you think that I might be unfaithful?...Its one thing for you to internally know its 'just a dream', but the message I'm getting is very different. I'm not sure whether I need to change my behaviors, just give you space, or handle some kind of misunderstanding that led you to think about this type of thing...If its truly just a simple dream, I'd appreciate you taking the question out of the situation, if you said something like 'I had a dream about you being unfaithful and I know its silly but I still feel annoyed, but I know its not your fault, I just need to decompress a bit' it would make it much easier for me to navigate this type of situation.\"",

            "text": "Hi there, lady insight incoming. \n\nBoth my husband and I have had those dreams and moved past them and are living a normal happy healthy life together. \n\nFirst thing to consider: dreams are brain activity, but the emotional impact of them is real, in a sense. When you wake up from a nightmare, it can take some time to calm yourself and while you intellectually know there aren’t monsters trying to kill you, your body has released the chemicals that it would if the experience was real. \n\nTakeaway: your partner may KNOW deep down that this is irrational, but is processing the impact of the subconscious experience in a similar way (to a degree) as the real experience. This is normal and human and also h fortunate. \n\nRecommendation: loving reassurance. It’s worked for both of us: a big tight hug and a ‘sweetheart you know that would never happen but I’m sorry you had that dream’ plus taking a bit of extra time and energy to make your partner feel loved and secure that day, will go a long way. \n\nBoth of us have had unfaithful partners in the past, we have some crappy past experiences as a result, and so those feelings can really resonate in a way that’s hard to explain even while we’re sitting there acknowledging that they’re irrational. And if this is your person, why not take care of them? Treat it like an extra bad day that’s not your fault (because that’s literally what it is) and offer some extra love and care. \n\nultimately,relationships aren’t about being wrong or right or having the moral high ground or not. It’s about making sure both of you are good to go and have both feet on the ground, metaphorically speaking. It’s childish of her to not speak to you for a few hours, if it’s because she’s mad at you and wants you to feel punished. But please consider that maybe she needs time to work through those emotions on her own time and just needs some space. If there’s a possibility that it’s the latter scenario, ask for more communication and establish your boundaries (eg: if you’re upset at dream me, I would hope that you can still behaving lovingly toward real me, or tell me that you need a couple hours of space to work your shit out) and that should be the bare minimum of what you can expect. \n\nTo;dr- feelings don’t make sense but it’s what both of you do with them that counts. And when in doubt, add more love, not less. If she’s the one feeling crummy, draw some more confidence from within and use it to love harder. It’ll pay dividends.",

It’s kind of that stupid psychologist thing, because you think it, it’s real.  Sure your feelings are real, but that’s a far cry from facts.  You can tell a lot about someone based on their insecurities, accusations, and defenses. It pretty much a window to who they are.

For example in this case the metaphor of discovering the infidelity might invoke the same type of anxiety that she may be experiencing in some other way in her own life, but caused by something completely different. Further example: maybe she relates to you as a part of her security and she is struggling with another piece of her feelings of security that she hasn't figured out how to relate to yet, so you are the metaphor of the security and her discovering the infidelity is the metaphorical setting where she can struggle to relate to her actual feelings. The real feelings can just be chemical -- too much sugar, PMS, no sleep, or they can be real -- work stress, family stressors, a bad doctor visit.\n\nIt doesn't really matter the cause. The point is don't be offended and get defensive  or assume you know what it is about. The big thing is to simply say you're sorry she is having bad dreams and sympathize with how stressful they sound. It's ok also to call out how it makes you feel when you get the cold shoulder, but keep it basic: \"every time you have that dream you and (others) give me the cold shoulder for a while.

She may harbor some deep insecurities about herself and your fidelity to her on an emotional level. You may not have cheated on her yet, but she may suspect that you could down the road if an opportunity presents itself. If this is the case, then telling her you think her getting mad at you after she wakes up is “funny” will make her worry more because you aren’t in her eyes taking the subject of spousal fidelity seriously (even if it is all in her head. On the other hand, she herself might struggle with temptation. The roles could have been switched in her actual dream. The most cynical take is that there was no dream at all and this is all to lay the groundwork for her cheating on you in the future or you finding out she already had an affair. Or she could really have dreamed what she says she dreamed and be dense enough to blame you for it without anything more to it. I would ask her to clarify in explicit terms why she is upset. Ask her if she really holds you accountable for something her brain made up in a dream. Ask her why she thinks she had the dream. Be loving and understanding but also firm. From what you have provided, you did nothing to deserve how she is treating you. Don’t apologize.

Her anger is. \n\nThere's really no reason to overly try and interpret the dream itself. \n\nHere's the facts: \n\n* She had a dream about infidelity \n* Having the dream made her feel bad\n* She was disturbed enough by it that she felt she had to communicate it to you\n\nEvery good and healthy relationship is built on a mutual system of trust. For example: if a cheating spouse is a deal breaker for you, then you communicate to your partner upfront that you're honestly interested in a committed and monogamous relationship. \n\nRight? \n\nThat bit is important because that's how our relationships grow and strengthen with other people. We do that over and over and over about anything and everything. \n\nI think a lot of people don't have these big conversations about what matters to them, and they absolutely should. \n\nBut I think even fewer people reaffirm these things. And that's important because it can strengthen a bond that is wavering. \n\nYou can say something to acknowledge that her dream made her angry and then weave to a discussion about relationship boundaries. \n\nThen you affirm what you want: \"I am committed to you and being faithful in this relationship.\" You ask her to affirm what she wants. And the truth is, maybe one of you doesn't want to reaffirm. But this is your chance to discover or admit that plainly and painlessly. And maybe you do both want to reaffirm, but she needed the affirmation to be stated plainly to feel reassured. Maybe you do too. \n\nI think we're all pretty bad about telling each other what we want. That's really hard to teach because our dumb brains really make it hard to figure out what we want. What is a lot easier to teach is telling each others why we are grateful **for them.** So try to think of why your loved ones matter to you and **say it to them**. \n\nBecause sometimes, the thing we want but don't have the words to ask for, is to hear why we matter to someone.\n\nYou don't have to say it special. Saying \"\\[Person\\], I really like when we spend time together golfing\" is really going to make that person enjoy golfing with you more. \n\nAnd guess what, if they weren't sure if you were into it and they heard you say that, they can reaffirm their own love for golfing with you. \n\nGolfing, in this instance, is a metaphor for your relationship.   \n\n\nI'm not a relationship coach so take all this for what it's worth from a stranger on the internet who thinks too much.

I would say when it gets to the point of kicking you out of bed, getting into a heated argument or asking you to apologize for it obviously goes too far.

Even if nothing happened, and they recognize it’s just a dream, the thought can trigger emotions that can’t just be turned off. \n\nSimilarly if her giving you the cold shoulder hurts you, let her know and try to come to an understanding and plan the best course of action for what to do when that happens.",

Try to limit the use of 'you' statements, use 'I feel's a lot. And then ask her to share her feelings with you and to reflect on why something that she objectively knows is a dream is impacting her waking feelings this strongly and more than once? Ask if she believes that maybe this could be her way of handling some other stress in your relationship or even in her life in general. It doesn't even have to be fidelity-related, it could just be something that is serving as a proxy for her feelings about something else.\n\nI would advise that you do not do this while she is still processing these feelings because that could put her on the defensive and she's already upset  enough as it is. But at the same time, don't wait too long after one of these dreams because the self-reflection might be too difficult for both of you. And maybe you can even give her a headsup that you want to talk about this and that you'd like to \"schedule\" a time and that you're doing this so that you can both reflect before talking. If you did it in a safe and non-accusatory manner, hopefully that will lower the risk that both of you instead of using the time to genuinely reflect and self-analyze it's instead used to time to \"hone your arguments\" and prepare your defenses.\n\n\nAssuming that you are both emotionally healthy adults(I don't mean this to be judgmental but you're the best judge of where you both are emotionally as individuals and in your relationship), we all get these feelings that we have difficulty pinpointing the source of but that can feel incredibly intense and difficult to deal with. Even  more so if we have a 'cause' for them, even if the cause for them in these case is a dream. Basically, give your partner the benefit of the doubt and work with her together to get to the root of this. Even if you can't pinpoint it definitively, the very act of doing this cooperatively can only help your relationship.",

There are a lot of comments talking about the craziness of this phenomena in women but that dont give you an answer to your question. \n\nYour partner had a dream that you cheated and is mad. So let's consider the dream itself. Dreams do not appear out of nothing, they are simply a reflection of a tumultuous, internal, complex, biological machine. Yes, they are often clearly cryptic and hard to understand, but it still means something. Dreams, like other things cannot come into being \"ex nihilo\", that is, from nothing. And if that is the case, it has an origin, it is made from something else or a combination of something elses. \n\nIt is possible that there is something else that is bothering your partner. Perhaps she is worried about betrayal in general or perhaps betrayal by another person she loves (father, brother, friend), or has been already betrayed by someone at work? Maybe there is something else about the state of the relationship currently that she doesnt want to talk about? Or maybe there is something that you yourself are doing that she isnt happy with (not fidelity related) but hasnt said anything?\n\nMy advice would be to talk to her about her dream. Dont make her feel like she is crazy or it is \"just a dream\" that doesnt matter. Explore the dream in a mature way, again, without thinking about who is right or wrong or at fault. Perhaps if you scratch a bit under the surface you will uncover something that is truly bothering her, maybe something she hasnt even admited to herself yet, and it is manifesting itself as this particular iteration of a dream \n\nI think you will find that there is certainly a deeper issue there (deeper than the mere existence of a dream) and if you work together, openly and courageously, you can fix it together. \n\nThat how I think you could address your partner.",

Yes you have done nothing wrong. Her thoughts/dreams have caused her feelings. Her thoughts/dreams control her feelings. Honestly this can be a losing battle because it’s she how needs to recognize and reinstate her value. No matter what you do if she’s insecure, she will remain insecure until she changes her thoughts. \nThe only thing I can suggest is that you can calmly, try to remind her how she has value. Like don’t point out how “this is silly” or “foolish” just make it about how she’s amazing, not cuz you think so, but maybe an example of things she’s good at. How she’s is valued. She needs to come to terms with her thoughts and insecurities but there is never a clear road on getting them there. It depends on the person and her thoughts, you never have control of another persons thoughts which then control their feelings. If you love them accept this and be there on their road of self acceptance. It means zero about you or your fidelity. Hope this finds you and helps.\n\n\nI re-read this a bunch before posting and of course there are a couple typos, figure it out hahah!",

I am not a professional mental health advisor either.\n\nI've had this dream, several times with several partners.\n\nI am a lucid dreamer, my dreams feel so real sometimes it's hard to differentiate the dream world from reality. Having a dream like this is difficult for me because it feels real even though I know its not actually happend.i know the dream manifested itself in my own head from my own fears, and possibly from behaviors I have subconciously picked up from my partners. That fear, manifested from somewhere and needs to be addressed.\n\nMy advice, from the perspective of what I would need to hear from a partner:\n\nValidate your partners dream. Do not attack them for their fear. Reassure them that their feelings are valid and that dreams do cause us to have real feelings. Remind them of your faithfullness and desire for them. Reasssure them that you value them and would not do anything that would hurt them. Tell them you have fears too. Tell them something vulnerable that you fear too.\n\nListen and hold them. Let them vent out the dream. Let the reality they experience with you in real life being suportive and not combative.\n\nPerhaps, offer to go as a team to see a proffesional to talk out this dream and both of your fears. Say things like, this is hard to know what to say but that you are a supporting partner that doesn't want them to have to face this alone. Tell them you feel like someone educated in this sort of thing would help you help them in the best way possible. Tell them you want to be the best partner in real life and in their dreams.\n\nYeah, that sucks to have to do. You didn't actually cheat. Ypu didnt earn this distrust. However, sometimes one partner has to be the stronger one and carry the other. Carry your partner through this.",

These insecurities could be caused by trauma/bad past relationships or it could just be low self-esteem. These insecurities can also be a result of upbringing and the things women are taught to expect from men in relationships but that’s a whole other discussion. \n\nThe second (low EQ) is the inability to recognize and regulate one’s own emotions in a healthy way. It can also make it difficult to discern emotions caused by real situations and those felt in response to fantasy situations (for example someone who can’t move past the death of a movie character may have a lower EQ).A person with a healthy EQ may feel hurt or a little angry upon waking but once they realize it was a dream, quickly work to rationalize those feelings and move on. Or they may share the dream with their partner to help regulate those emotions and likely laugh about it (minimize it).\n\nDreams DO serve a purpose and dreams like these help us explore insecurities or fears that nag our subconscious. They are meant to help us face our fears. An inability to cope with the emotions caused by such dreams points to issues that should be addressed both personally and as a couple.\n\nEdit: left out an important tidbit",

I’m sorry your dream made you feel so afraid.” Society doesn’t tell children their emotional pain is stupid when they have a nightmare, we acknowledge their fear because its real and dreams make emotions more real than considering any said scary thought while awake. I suggest acknowledging the fear and reassuring its just a dream and will not happen and that they and their emotions are safe with you. Its a human response to close up and not want to talk about something upsetting when faced with defensiveness especially when she/he was probably upset by the fear of you doing it not the act of you doing it. Fears manifest in dreams and reassurance helps the fear dissipate. I have had dreams about a partner cheating and was of course upset and if they had been defensive(protecting themselves instead of tending to self inflicted wounds) it would have justifiably made me not want to share any more about the fear. My rule of thumb is usually to tend to the person who hurt first and getting offended comes second or else it always blows up with just about any relationship not just partners. Whoever was hurt first needs aid first and unbiased TLC, and when the hurt subsides you can talk about how offensive and hurtful it feels to be thought about like that on a very untrue and subconscious level. Because they know its unreasonable but also in the well of emotions cant pull themselves out without your help and dont need a reminder that their mind is playing tricks on them instead of receiving support. Lots of people cheat and it can cause emotional and psychological trauma that simply needs patience and understand until that ability to trust is regained. It’s not ideal nor perfect, just human. Eta you dont have to go through it yourself to be traumatized, anything from a parent causing home discord or childhood friends showing immaturity by cheating and thinking its okay ruining the friendship just because you know its wrong is enough to cause fears because it becomes a blatant reality how bad the problem of cheating is in society.",

I would avoid being upset with her, reassure her, but you're also allowed to create & keep any boundaries that you feel you might need, like asking her to even if she feels angry with you about it, she should recognize that feelings are not facts, & although we can't prevent feelings from coming, we can choose how to react to them. \n\nAnd its a pretty established fact that if one partner accuses the other partner of wrongdoing, but they are innocent, it will eventually wear down the relationship, either pushing that person to enact the wrong or they just decide they want a relationship without this continued stress.",

Reassure her you wouldn’t do that in “real life” and that she has nothing to worry about, and that she’s the only woman in your eyes.
