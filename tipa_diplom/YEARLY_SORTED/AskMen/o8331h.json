Bras are a form of concealment, primarily of movement and nipples. We wear clothes in the first place to conceal our bodies, right? A bra is additional concealment and not wearing one is more exposure. In addition, for women with large breasts, they provide necessary physical support. That's all there is to this. \n\nSo, if a woman showed up to a date not wearing a bra, I would think that she is comfortable exposing herself more than the average woman.

Our friends and family definitely took notice. Some obviously didn't approve, others just had trouble not looking. Plus it's an entirely different feeling for your boobs to move around freely when you are used to them being confined.\n\nI think the only reason I stuck it out was because of my husband making comments. Specifically telling me to be concerned about others opinions has always driven me crazy. My mom used to say stuff like that all the time when I was growing up. \n\nNow they are all used to it and no one even notices anymore. My husband realized he had much easier access and gets annoyed if he finds I am wearing a bra. (I do still wear one at work and periodically depending on what I'm doing).",

I mean, who wears something like this and doesn‚Äôt want people to look?\n\nI looked, they were fantastic. Then we went about our conversation.\n\nI spent a year in California and I saw it so much it‚Äôs somewhat normalized for me now.\n\nEdit:spelling",

            "text": "In general: It's going to be an adjustment, but worth it. The more normal this is, the better. There are some few who already do it, and the world has not collapsed. I also support the Free the Nipples campaign, and I think women should basically do what they want with their bodies, most obviously in this case where it's just what you're going to wear. I think that falls under she's minding her business, making her own choices, others should mind their business too and make their own, live and let live yada yada.\n\nPractically, I do find it takes an adjustment for me, personally. Which I'm willing to make. I'm just still on that journey. It's not that it doesn't surprise me a bit or come across as novel when I see pictures of people in public with just a shirt and you can tell there's no bra, but who cares? That said, as a practical matter, it's still what I've been taught, not to see it as usual. And It's practically speaking not the more common thing, so I'm not used to it yet. It's rather that I want to become less surprised, and I do need to work on building a bank of neurons that notices un-bra'd nipples and correctly files the visual information as \"not sexual\" -- because there's so little exposure and representation in our culture of nonsexualiszed female nipples, it's an adjustment learning to categorize nipples as not sexual by default. And I am actually getting there, example by example.\n\nI find that, rather than what someone's wearing or not, it's more in the intent and how they carry themselves and ultimately how they communicate with other people that is the real signal of \"is this person being sexual or not?\" And when in actual doubt I would be inclined to round down to \"no, this person is not being sexual.\" Like there are actual nudists who aren't being sexual. Not wearing a bra we should be able to handle as a society as well.\n\nA note of nuance: \"Attractive\" and \"a person who's being actively and intentionally sexual\" are two different things. I can find someone's form appealing without disrespecting their boundaries or being disrespectful in general. I can make a little mental note \"she looks nice\" and then just move on with my day. So it doesn't matter whether or not I find \"no bra\" attractive, a woman has a right to inhabit her body and not be misinterpreted or mistreated because of it. It does not necessarily invite extra attention, and it's no excuse to harass or ogle any more than someone wearing a bra, really. A glance maybe, but I glance at everybody. I think we all do.\n\nYou also asked about dating, but I don't date. I imagine I would either be cool about it, or if one of us was comfortable or brave enough to broach the subject, I would try to get her perspective what it means to her or what factors she made when making that choice. Like, if she wants to talk about it then I want to know how she thinks. If I was into somebody and not being particularly smooth that day, I could end up looking too much, but I consciously know that's a bad idea, so hopefully I would do better than that. Or it depends, maybe she's into that and lets me know as much, lol IDK. But yeah, by default I would try to be chill and not look that much. As a point of empathy, I don't want my date staring voraciously at my nips, so yeah I get that.",

You do you, boo boo.  I would notice and appreciate her boobs more in my head (if they were nice), but again, I wouldn't care or make the evening about her boobs or stare.",

After a couple of summer days it's not distracting at all, even for a lonesome guy like me.\n\nI'm not picking a fight or anything, but I really hope the day comes when Americans will start to preface their posts with \"in America\", just to put our society into a global perspective. \n\nIt seems to me that through the 20th century American society was viewed as progressive and exemplary by many countries around the world. I don't think that's the case any more. The world continues to learn and grow, often faster than America does. So many things in America get sexualized, then weaponized. American women burned their bras in the 1960's to protest society's judgmental take on this choice. It does seem like progress stopped there, and now these fearless women  are just \"boomers\" to the American Reddit crowd. \n\nThis whole bra debate is kind of juvenile  and stale, and perpetuated by people who are set in their ways. Sorry if I offended someone.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that some women here are dressed to the nines and the braless look is endlessly confident and fashionable on some of these women.

What your ears are folded a little? It gets a little foggy in your glasses? Try having a metal wire stab you a half inch deep and you don‚Äôt even realize bc IT ALWAYS HURTS THAT MUCH.

She was wearing no bra and I could see her brest and nipples. I did not see it in a horny way, but curious. I was wondering \"This is their real form? It looks very different with the bra.\"\nIt's more difficult and uncomfortable when it's a relative. It's not that the straight men have the tendency to look breasts all the time because we are stupid, horny o just men all the time, you know what I mean, it's just that when girls don't use bra, it's something that you can notice no matter what, something that it's supposed to be in a way suddenly it's not. And that little tiny change is a completely relevant because you can notice it, and you cannot avoid to thing about it.\nIn mi opinion this matter has a great conversation about the culture, the values, the sexualization, and most. I believe that it's more comfortable for you, girls. but no when you feel that all the gazes are on you just for a simple and no harming change. And I am not a woman to tell what they should wear, not wear but I can speak for my self to say that it should not be a problem. But  I can not blame me for notice it. If I behave like a total jerk just for see a woman with no bra, the asshole it's me.",

Like, it‚Äôs there but you have to be up close and sort of actively looking for it to notice, to way over the top ridiculous outfits some younger girls in a particular fashion trend that 100% confirmed by my wife those cut off jeans riding all the way up the crack cannot possibly be comfortable or practical; and the tiny low cut tops have to be adjusted every other step or stuff will spill out of them.\n\nI think the most pointless one was a middle aged woman who was jogging braless. She was very big up front and stuff was like asynchonically bouncing like left up right down then weirdly side slap against each other rinse repeat.\n\nWife is pretty big too and has consistently complained about how bothersome and sometimes even painful the bouncing is when working out. I get that different women have different sensitivities but maybe it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve been married for too long I suppose.\n\nIf she showed up braless I‚Äôd politely let her know her nipples are showing since that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs asked me to do. She gets to check herself and decide it it‚Äôs ok or not and then we can do something about it if needed, if not no big deal. She enjoys teasing me from time to time.\n\nAs a married guy with no serious interest whatsoever in anyone else other than my wife, nothing wrong with more eye candy imo. Boobs are awesome.",

Not just braless, but also topless. Unless it's a high density public place, you can do that and nobody beats an eye. Also women at the beach sometimes sunbathe topless. And when they get up to go buy a drink or something they don't bother to put a bra. Shops and restaurants usually receive you topless. And if they don't you can hang your towel on your shoulders and cover your breasts. Obviously some women do this, some don't. I'd say 1 in 100 women get topless. And virtually all younger girls go braless. Older women usually go bare breasted more often than younger women. Compared with 1 in 5 men that open their shirts. And 1 in 20 taking their shirts off altogether. And no, we're so used to it that we don't go all apeshit and stare on them. They're part of the usual scenary.

Actually - fun fact - my dad owned a strip club when I was growing up and he thought that well-dressed women were the sexiest, because they left something to the imagination.

Some people say only take that road if your boobs are \"hot\" or \"perky\" or whatever, but honestly no matter what size or shape or age they are, the fact that you're comfortable and confident enough in your body to go around without the extra concealment really does it for me.
