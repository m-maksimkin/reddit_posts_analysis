She would just out of the blue walks up and will say \"I want you to...\"\n\nWife is a trooper though, on our honeymoon she said \"Hey, I want to make sure that you never cheat on me because you are not fulfilled, so I read an old Cosmopolitan and it said whenever your husband's favorite show is, blow him during it, let him call his shot, face, mouth, you name it... but I don't know your favorite show\".  That same day my best friend's wife said to him in the background of a conversation complaining...\"You know, our TV is always on and sportcenter plays 24/7 something other than sportcenter would be nice\".  \n\nSo I told my new bride \"Sportcenter\".  It's been years and sportcenter is still always on.  I say this so the rest of you know if ever asked this question.  \n\nIt's freaking great, I do it a few times a week, 4-5 times during her... monthly. I turn on TV BOOM.\n\nMy neighbors were like you should get rid of Cable cause Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max & Disney is less expensive and I was like...NO!!!
