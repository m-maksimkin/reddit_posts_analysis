    "When is it okay to resort to violence?\nContext: I was at a bar with my girlfriend and some friends and saw a dude trying to hit on my girlfriend and buy her a drink while she was closing her tab. I choose to ignore it as she was handling it well, and when she returned to my side she hugged me and the guy who was trying to flirt followed her, approached me and grabbed my bicep. I asked him why he was grabbing my arm and told him to let go, while showing slight resistance. It was loud in there but I could tell he verbally responded aggressively and didn’t release me. Before I was about to punch him with my free arm, I heard my girlfriend say we should go, to which I was able to get my arm back and we walked away, while this guy chirped at us. At what point would it of been the appropriate to hit this guy?": [

With his arm trapped under mine I stepped into him and with a fist I delivered a straight punch direct to his solar plexus. \n\nHe didn't drop because he couldn't, he didn't do or say anything, he just stood and struggles to breath. \n\nMy girlfriend at the time got really scared and started to panic, I calmly sat him on a bar stool and said aren't you glad that wasn't your throat. \n\nI left, and then slowly watched as that relationship crumbled, it went south because she saw me use violence, I'm my view it was because I had no choice, his hand was already on me and his demeanor ment me harm. She was afraid, first for me, then for him, thinking that I would cause him serious injury.  Then started worrying that I would turn it on her. \n\nHere's what I wish I had done, I wish that I had turned away and said to her that she's free to choose for herself, that I will not get into a fight for her. \n\nUnfortunately I fear much that had I done that the relationship would have gone south because she would have seen it as my choice to let her face any danger and she can't rely on me for my help. \n\nCe la vie I suppose. \n\nSo what does this mean, not much I suppose, fight when you have no other choice, if you can walk away then do so, now I view any fight o can walk away from is one that I've won, if you must fight then always be prepared to go one level higher than the guy in front of you.\n\nBruce Lee held the idea that you bruise my skin and I'll break your bones, you break my bones and I'll take your life, I agree with that statement, if you have to fight then fight to win.",

He could be a better fighter than you with more training and more experience taking punches. You may come out of this with a broken body part, a hurt organ, or something more serious. *EVEN*if you win.\n\n2. He may have friends in the bar. \n\n3. He may be armed with a knife or other weapon and willing to use it.\n\nDe-Escalating the situation and walking away when you weren't FORCED to fight, was the smartest move. You walked away without any damage and your life can basically continue as if he doesn't exist. Fighting as far as I'm concerned, is for when running away is absolutely impossible or there is clear harm to others that you are in a position to prevent. You were able to leave and you did. Good on you for suppressing ego and being smart about this.\n\nFor precisely situations like these, I carry around OC spray. If someone were to grab me or my wife, I don't want to get into a fistfight with them because someone can very seriously get hurt, and I definitely don't want to pull my concealed weapon because that would be a criminal act for a small altercation and not why I carry.\n\nOC spray is wonderful because it:\n\na. Will temporarily blind, sting, and burn your attackers' face.\n\nb. Will result in immediate attitude adjustment as he tries to deal with the fact that his eyes, nose, throat and mouth feel like they are burning.\n\nc. Results in zero permanent damage to him or you. Effects lessen within an hour and disappear within 24. No one has fists or feet coming at them.\n\nIt gives you the time you need to walk away without actually engaging in a fight.",

He got in my face and started poking my chest yelling that I had some kind of problem.  I kept my hands visible the entire time and insisted that there was no problem and apologized for doing anything that he may have perceived as hostile.  He then whistled to his car and a massive dog jumped out.  He gave a command to his dog and the beast walked around my car and sat down behind me.  This guy had clearly trained his dog to do this.  I was in between my car and the pump with him in front of me and the dog behind.  Truly frightening.  I had a knife on me but my handgun was in my car so I was properly fucked if things had escalated.  The station attendant came out at this point to see what was happening so I waved her off to show this guy that someone else was watching.  I kept insisting that there was no problem while he was yelling and carrying on.  Asked him if he had a bad day and if he needed anything.  Not sure what it was but this guy was beyond pissed off about something.  This situation went on for a few minutes before Dude finally backed down and went back to his vehicle.  I was truly frightened that things were going to end up a lot worse, but luckily they didn’t.  Sometimes it’s just better to stand your ground and keep a cool head because you can never really tell how things are going to play out.",

I'm not a small guy, not huge but I train in the gym and can lift more than my body weight in most cases. I told her I understand that intellectual men only fight when it's absolutely necessary, that it wasn't worth it and possibly I could get a criminal record (UK) and ruin my future,  and her being called a bitch didn't warrant a punch...

The idea is that you are not safe in damaging someone enough that they no longer value the life that you have destroyed and so sacrificing their life to take yours is seen as a good transaction.

But I’ve also had experiences in the past where someone tried to hold my arm or hand in a seemingly nonviolent intent as a prelude to _actually_ attacking me, violating me in some physical manner or to hold me down for someone else to do the same. So life has taught me to fight back as soon as someone tries to touch me, instead of waiting too long and finding myself physically restrained by someone who’s attacking me or a loved one. My restraint to someone putting their hands on me has backfired, whereas the times I _didn’t_ show restraint did not cause me as severe of an issue. \n\nI think you did well by not hitting him, because in the heat of the moment, it’s hard to know how the situation will develop and whether or not you need to immediately fight back or not. Sometimes throwing a punch isn’t warranted and you can deescalate. Sometimes if you wait it’s too late to adequately defend yourself. Ultimately, I still abide to _violence as a last resort,_ but it’s not always easy to tell when that threshold has been crossed. When strangers are concerned or I’m without backup, I would take the more cautious approach. When my attacker is familiar and I’m more confident in my ability to win an altercation, I might be quicker to fight back- but still _never_ be the one to actually initiate violence. \n\nP.S. I also wear glasses and am near blind without them, so I have more reason to get a blow in before I’m hit, because it’s probably game over for me if I lose my eyeglasses in a fight, as I’ve learned the hard way.",

Bar/street fights are very unpredictable, it is extremely easy for something random to happen where you get severely injured. People often don't appreciate how bad a brain injury is, you can be permanently disabled by way less force than you would expect. Get knocked out and hit the ground wrong, sucker punched, hell even win and have him break a bottle over your head as you leave-- any of these could mean lifelong disability.\n\nIn the end, it's just not worth the risk over some stupid guy getting aggro at a bar.

But when it comes to legal defense it's all about what you can prove.\n\nI have found myself in this position quite a few times in my life. What I would have done is made sure to yell \"get your fuxking hands off me before I make you\" as loud as possible while getting the attention of a bouncer. And then a swift palm to the bridge of the nose. DO NOT strike the end of the nose in an upward motion, as that can actually kill a person.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in a fight that could end with you being hurt badly (i.e any fight on concrete, or one where you are out numbered, and one where you have no option to run, because not being in a fight is the best way to win a fight, go for broke. Firstly, always yell as loud as you can, I don't want to fight you, leave me alone, let me leave. This is for others around you to hear so that the can then corroborate your story to the cops. Do not trade blows. End the fight as quickly and brutally as possible. Bite the side of their neck and rip and tear the flesh, drive your thumbs into their eyes as hard and far as you can, throw heads into the concrete. Most fights end within seconds, very few last a minute or more. Grab and pull on the nuts, if you have to grab anything that can be used as a club or knife.\n\nWhen the fight is over, if you are still conscious, be the first to call the cops. Make sure you tell them you told your attackers you didn't want to fight. 😭 CRY. Tell them they wouldn't let you leave, tell them you didn't want to do it. Make yourself the gentleman that was forced to defend yourself. And when the cops get there tell them nothing and call a lawyer asap.\n\nIt is ALWAYS better to avoid a fight if possible, even if you have to \"look like a pu$$y\" and run.\n\nBut, when you are forced to fight, make it loudly known that you do not want to fight, and then fight like your life depends on it. Because it does. Often when someone is knocked out that isn't the end of the violence. Some people will kick/stomp someone who is unconscious. It is better to be in jail/prison than to be dead. And make sure you say that in court. That you didn't want to fight, you told them that, you yelled it, they forced the issue, and you fought like you did because you were afraid if you didn't you'd end up getting your head stomped in while unconscious.\n\nHope that this answers your question and that you are never in this position.",

Since self defense is a thing you have, as long as they start the fight you can reasonably end it, given you only respond with equal or slightly greater force. Once the guy can't fight anymore you back off. Then YOU or whoever is witness calls the police. You stay and tell them police he followed your gf, was a creep.

That ended the violence & I made a vow to never, ever fear another human.\n\nWhen I was just slightly older than that, I found out that my good friend had kept a secret from me & I was angry, I was so angry ALL the time, for many reasons, but I wanted to hit him but he was my friend so I punched the car door, right next to his head, where he had been seated & leaning against. This was over 20 years ago, cars were heavier & built differently so when we all realized that I had not only dented the door, making a huge, deep dent, but I had actually cracked the metal, I realized that if I could do that as a teen, when I got older, I might be actually dangerous, so dangerous I might be able to kill someone by accident or in a rage.\n\nThat didn't change my anger or toxicity, but it did change how I fought, so the other part of my suggestion is this, don't fight unless you have to, & doing it to impress anyone, or even defend anyone when they don't need you to or need that as the defense, is not a  good reason. But if you need to use violence, use the minimum, don't try to break them, just sit them down hard. Make them stay there long enough to understand that you are actively preventing more violence. You are doing them, you & everyone a favor by not turning this into a big showdown. Its not about proving your power, or ability, or toughness, its about preventing violence in the most economic way possible.\n\nBut the other thing is that sometimes the law doesn't work great, & sometimes it makes sense to go have one of those 'conversations' with a man about his behavior & actions moving forward. It doesn't always work, it doesn't always work for long, but I have made it work enough times that I'll say it.

That’s a really big thing to learn, and it can be terrifying to someone that may see you as a “mark”. Learning how to hit can also be terrifying to that same sort of person. But most importantly, training will teach you self control. It will keep you out of bars, because you’re trying to be better at training. I’m not bagging on having a night out. But it’s amazing how much more fun you’ll have at the boxing, Muay Thai, Jiu-Jitsu, Tae Kwon Do, Karate, Kendo, Wrestling, Kung Fu studio, than at your local bar. It’s also pretty awesome when you and your fellow practitioners go out for a few drinks, because then you’ve got other, trained people looking out for you, and you’ve got their backs too.

I think you failed by your statement \"I chose to ignore it as she was handling it well\".  Did you ask her if she knew the guy? Someone she dated before? Not many facts. \n\nWhen he grabbed your arm you should have pushed him back with great force. If he falls and gets hurt tough luck. You were just getting the guy out of your face. It draws attention to get the doorman or anyone else to intervene before it gets out of hand. If you hit him that is intent to do harm and the consequences could be dire. That is really a dumb thing to do and you don't know if the guy deserves it. He could be doped up or drunk. Why he grabbed your arm? Maybe the dude was hitting on you after he struck out with your gf. Not sure what kind of joint you were in.",

You were able to walk away and he didn’t act physically violently towards you so if you punched him during this you’d end up being the one that people said was the instigator of the fight and end up being the one police booked for assault. You acted the right way. \n\nIn a general answer: Once you can’t walk away any more than you already have, when they throw the first punch so you can claim self defence, basically always use it as last resort because if anything goes wrong and somebody gets seriously hurt (which happens way easier than people think) you could end up doing time if you weren’t the one actively seen trying to deescalate the situation. If you had punched this dude over this, he fell and hit his head which caused damage to his brain or death you’d be in jail right now over a drunk dude trying to chat up your girlfriend. It’s just never worth it unless you have exhausted the alternatives. And that’s before you consider you have no idea who this stranger is and their fighting ability/willingness to stab you over it. You could just as easily be the one getting the shit kicked out of you or getting stabbed/shot over nothing if you throw a pointless punch. Just use violence when you literally don’t have another choice and you can never use it wrong.",

Fights almost NEVER go the way people expect them to. The guy could have had a weapon, and was purposefully looking for a fight or someone to use it on. He could have had 3 buddies with him you didn't know about. A random person could have seen you as the aggressor and hit you with a beer bottle. The possibilities are endless, but I'm sure you see my point.\n\nIf you're going to use violence, just know there could be consequences you aren't aware of. You could be damaged for life (like your eye gets poked out) over something seemingly trivial in comparison.\n\nWhile it may sound like I'm advocating against violence, that's not actually true--I'm actually a big fan of using violence at appropriate times for appropriate situations with appropriate amounts of force. It's a tool you can use to solve a problem, just like talking to someone.

E.g. I came upon a fight .. two dudes, ... one somewhat bigger stronger dude, and bigger, stronger, fitter, and younger than I - he got the other dude in a serious headlock, and was hard pummeling the sh\\*t out of the guy's head - driving his fist into the side of the guy's head hard, over and over and over again.  Well, I was having none of that.  I positioned myself behind the big dude, and the moment I had the opportunity, I grabbed through and around his arms, basically pinning his arms back, locking my arms together to hold him like that, and allowing the other guy a chance to escape.\n\nBut most of the time violence is *not* the answer.  Think.  Use your head.  Be aware of what's going on.  Generally work to deescalate rather than escalate.\n\nBut, yeah, ... always exceptions.  Some dude is up in a tower with a semi-automatic with a scope, shooting and taking out lots of innocents, picking 'em off in rapid succession, one right after the other.

I never hurt anyone badly but in both cases I did throw the men down onto their backs (just how it turned out).  In hindsight I’m glad I did it but I would also warn people that these situations can be very bad for two reasons, 1. You can get hurt badly or killed or 2. you could hurt or kill someone else.  Honestly, as horrible as some people are it probably isn’t worth it.  That said, I clearly have a “trigger” if I see a man getting physically abusive to a woman.

Which brings me to my next point, it's not a playground fight in these situations. One adult can take legal action against another adult. Dude could have hit you, you could have kicked his ass, you leave, later he files assult charges on you and you have a warrant out for your arrest. Even if you proven yourself innocent, it's going to cost you time and lawyers fees, you might spend a few days in jail. You might kill someone acedently and have to live with that. Your opponent gets knocked down, hits his head on a table or a curb, he could easily be killed or have brain damage. Or you could end up with broken bones or brain damage yourself.

I have seen enough bar fights to know that your best case scenario is to have the fight broken up early and you are kicked out. I have been personally involved in a couple altercations where a drunk asshole tried to start a fight and I backed off. When the bouncers/security saw and got involved, I wasn't the one they threw out or called the polive over to arrest because I wasn't taking swings and I was calm. When you are in a club/bar you are dealing with way too many unknowns. Fights like that aren't like in the movies where it's all controlled choreography. They are messy and end up in a brawl on the floor. I have seen people tackled into tables and railings that get hauled away on a stretcher because they can't feel their feet, someone get knocked the fuck out because they were tackled into a support post and more than one person grab a bottle and smash it over the other persons head. If you haven't see that let me tell you something....there is blood. LOTS of blood. Bar fights just aren't worth it in any way, shape or form. If you can walk away, walk away. If the place has security let them know on your way out that someone is trying to start shit. \n\nFor other situations, it's more of a gray area for me. I have a general rule now that if I am able to walk away I do, but I am an adult and I am big enough that people don't generally mess with me. My kid however is not and in a situation where there is constant bullying is a bit more complex. If my kid was being bullied every day by the same person/people and the school did nothing about it, I don't know that I wouldn't tell him to swing back if they start touching him. and no one is doing anything about it. At that point I would make sure I have extensive documentation that the school did nothing and the school admin and the board would have been made very aware that I have given my child full permission to fight back as hard as they can to deal with a situation they refuse to address.",

Because she spoke up about leaving; and there is something to women being the calming and soothing influence in a guy's life; you could simply say you didn't want to cause violence because your girlfriend didn't want it.\n\nIn my opinion, a show of violence depends on who, what, when, where, why, intent, motive, and external forces. Those are completely subjective. For example, you don't beat up the postman in front of your house with your bare fists because he put a letter in at an angle instead of face-up. The why doesn't justify such drastic action, and the intent and motive isn't there.  \nThe postman was doing his job, and couldn't have considered the placement of a letter as outrageous to your standards.  \n\n\nWith your example, the external forces played a huge role. Sometimes that factor isn't in play (it is a net-zero). But sometimes it is. For example, you don't beat someone up in front of the police (external force).  \n\n\nThose are my thoughts on the topic.\n\nP.S. some might include 'your ability'. That's really up to you. Some might argue that honor completely removes 'your ability' from the equation (e.g. a guy bigger and stronger than you bullies a child). Some might say it is smart (e.g. call someone else to handle the situation, and don't go against the bigger and stronger guy bullying a child).",

            "text": "I think you’re asking the wrong question.  It’s not really about appropriate, or inappropriate.  A lot of guys get their asses kicked, or even killed, in a situation where their actions were appropriate.  Fights aren’t only lost by the bad guy.  A lot of guys in your situation take a swing, but it escalates in a bad direction.  The guy gets hurt and witnesses don’t corroborate your side of the story.  The guy hits his head on a bar stool and had brain damage.  The guy is armed.  The guy has big friends with him.  The guy has a friend that recognizes you and know where you live, but you don’t know who the guy is.\n\nThere are an endless array of bad outcomes that can befall the good guy in his quest for appropriate response.\n\nI’m not a big guy but I am a mature guy and a confident guy, and was an Army Ranger at one time on my life…. And for me it’s not about appropriate.  If there’s a safe way to get me and my loved ones out of a bad situation without escalating, I am taking it, irrespective of whether options are appropriate.  If there isn’t, then I will resort to violence with an eye on whatever actions create the safest outcomes for me and those in my care, without regard to whether those actions will be seen as appropriate.  In other words, appropriateness is not part of my decision tree and shouldn’t be part of yours.  I do not seek justification, I seek best resolution.\n\nAnd don’t forget…. A wise man once said that being a “real man” means sometimes walking away from a fight you’re certain to win.  And sometimes fighting even when you know you will lose.",
