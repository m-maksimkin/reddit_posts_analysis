Turns out she's also REEEEALLLY Acesexual. the reason why this matters is because I'm the most stereotypical bisexual ever and to explain I will put it in haiku form:\n\nBecause I am bi\n\nI dream of üçÜ and üò∫\n\nGod! I am thirsty \n\nBut with realizing my bi-ness and embracing that sexuality . I've come unto a realization that im a fucking WHORE. I dream, I melt, I faint, for everyone I see .I love being so goddamn thirsty for everyone .\n\n  The dark side to this though is that though I have this massive thirst for everyone, no one has ever really shown that towards me. I'd like to remind everyone who's made it this far that being sexually attractive is different from being romantically attractive and aesthetically attractive. \n\nI have had a strong placing in 1/3 romantic with my wife and I think thats ultimately where it will stay. I'm not saying that I am disappointed that she is ace . Our relationship is not going to live and die over how many times she can call me pretty throughout the day. \n\nIts just ... I've learned that apart of my experiences with my being needs genuine unforced attraction for my physical body. The truth is? women don't always flex this muscle so I can't expect my wife to do that. That expectation is unfair anyway, I got married to her with the expectation that I'd provide and help her not so that she'd call me beautiful every once in a while. \n\n That need to feel physically attractive is super neccessary to me , my marriage counselor tells me that \"looks fade\" but like....thats not an answer to a life long want to feel pretty. It's just not. \n\nSo I guess to answer your question , through no fault of anyone, you can be disappointed by the fact in life that your partner just can't be what you'd like . They will have different needs that you will have to compromise with. They will be completly satisfied with never having enough sexual attraction to want to have sex and you can just be horny. But you can love them as they are. So as a man you just have to sometimes let things die inside of you, as a compromise to your partner, so that your partner can flourish as they are. Compromise is often times a disappointing experience.",

Literally within 5 minutes of hearing her say that (it took me that long to get around to believing her), I was just turned off by her.  I just did not want to be romantic with her any more.  She's super attractive, both physically and personality, but it was like my whole view of her shattered.  She and I just won't go anywhere besides friends right now all because of that.

I think it would also shake my confidence in being able to make it enjoyable for her and get her off.  You always hear about how intercourse by itself doesn't lead to orgasm for lots of women, and I could use my hands but that is less effective and something she can do by herself.\n\nETA 2: since people keep accusing me of various things, I will add a couple points:\n\n* I don't think I know better than a specific woman what gets her, specifically, off.  Nor would I insist on doing it \"my way\" if she said that something else is what she wanted (OK within reason).  If she says that she's not into oral but is into fingering, I'll believe her and do my best on the fingering front.\n\n* I realize that there's an added feeling to someone else using their hands on you vs you using your hands on yourself.  But in a similar vein I think that there is an added psychological element to someone doing something that you *can't* do to yourself.  Plus, in the past with women I've been with they've seemed to enjoy oral more than using hands.  I don't think it's crazy for that to lead to someone feeling more confident and at home doing one vs the other.  Plus, the fact that she's had plenty of practice using her hands on herself makes it seem more daunting.\n\n* I assumed that this was the norm, but maybe it's not - that people use their hands too when engaging in oral.  Certainly seems like the norm when it comes to doing oral on a guy, not sure why it wouldn't be when it's for a girl.\n\n* I'm aware vibrators exist, but I don't think that changes the point I'm making.",

My company throws a awesome xmas party every year, with entertainment, food, drinks, and the cost of the stay, all for free.  She hasn't gone a single year.  I try to get her to go out and eat once in awhile and it's like pulling teeth.  She says it's a waste of money when we can cook at home, but we never cook together, or sit down to a meal together.  By the time I get home from work she's out and about with our son, and I get to reheat my food from the fridge.  I just want to hang out with my friend more.  Kinda sucks.",

Maybe I should have felt it was *the first time* either way since it was technically our first times *together* and acted accordingly to make it special, even if just for myself, but it still made it feel hollow to me, finding out about it weeks/months after the fact. \n\nIt also made me upset because it felt like I couldn't be trusted??? Like I was apparently seen as shallow or too intimidating or something so they felt the need to lie about \"their body count\" so that I would sleep with them??? One even made up an elaborate story about getting drunk at a party at like 14-15, waking up a mess with some girl, and freaking out about it and regretting it. And then a year later I find out that was ALL MADE UP to *impress* me? Wtf does that even mean??? \n\nThe first guy I was just shocked and felt....devalued somehow? And ended the relationship for other reasons in addition to the weird lie. \n\nSecond guy, the \"party animal,\" has been my other half for years now after the ~revelation,~ but finding that out after was a huge blow to our trust because it was revealed so nonchalantly, on top of it, like a year later. (That was the only lie and after 2 months of not letting it go until he understood why the fuck I was so upset over it, and him finally apologizing, now we're mostly perfect.) I'm still pissy I don't remember our actual first time together tho, (when we were casual) which sucks majorly. To add insult to injury, I have a thing for virgins so would've put on a show!\n\nAnyways Imagine one person having beautiful, fond memories and the other person has zilch because they flat out were unaware anything special was going on. \n\nSo I was certainly hugely ~disappointed,~ but in the grand scheme of things, it was a dumb teenage lie from a dumb teenage dude and now we're dumb adults figuring out dumb shit together and it works!",
