Of course the bully launched into retaliation, and I don't know what to expect so I braced for a shove.

Nearly two classes and a couple of teachers emerged. No one did a thing. The guy lost the strength to beat me before anyone acted.\n\nJust one aspect of my childhood, but after hitting my head against the wall and getting pushed down so much I simply lost faith in my own ability to lead a good life.

I did take care of it), coloring books, crayons, and my prized teddy bear.... \n\nLong story short, some asshole stole the bag.... I went to get a drink and came  back to it gone.  Didnt even notice till we were packing to leave and I couldn't find it... \n\nI would definitely look for my teddy and red blankie first..... \nAnd if whoever did this happens to see this, that shit still keeps me up at night, you're a horrible person...",

Now I don't remember how, when, and why I lost it. When Bailey (my older sister's friend) found out I lost it, she was kinda sad and was wondering if I could find it. I never did. I've tried finding it in all the places that I mostly go to, even to this day I still try and find it... Also, Bailey moved away (I think out of state) 5-7 years ago, my older sister and Bailey lost contact after that. What I think what happened was some family stuff happened and they had to move away. I miss her and my lost oreo colored toy cat, I'm not sure if someone in my family put it in the donation box or It's stuffed somewhere in a tight space.",

I'd been recording songs on my shitty PC set up for a long time but finally got access to a more professional set up. I would burn CD's with my recordings to listen to in the car  while delivering pizzas for my job and think of ways to improve the songs, then I'd go to the studio, load my beats and lyrics from the USB drive & record better versions of everything.\n\nOne day I brought my USB stick to class to print out a research paper. We all had computers at our desks so I printed from there but mistakenly left the USB stick in the PC when class ended. I came right back after my next class maybe 90 mins later and it was already gone.\n\nThat same weekend, I spilled something on my laptop and ruined the hard drive.\n\nAt that point, I still had all of my music on CD's in my car and planned to just copy it all back to a hard drive once I got a new PC. Unfortunately, someone broke in and stole all of my CD cases out of my car while I was inside at a concert.\n\nSo now I have less than half of the music I ever recorded. Most of my lyrics and beats are gone forever. The demos that I wanted to re-record some day are gone forever. The studio I had been recording in also shut down around the same time. Within like 2 months I went from being serious about music to being disheartened. I'm trying to get back into it lately but I'd give anything to get my old shit back.",

My mother would often get rid of our toys that way, no matter how much we played with them, even when they weren't stored at her place but rather at my grandfather's. And even though she was the reason we had so many to begin with, dragging us with her to yard sales every summer, repeatedly on end.\n\nAnyway, she would claim it was lost, but I'm old enough to be aware of how thoughtless she was. That was my favorite stuffed animal and I spent hours searching for it in this old van we had at the far end of our yard, near the wooded area and our old metal barn. I was convinced it was in there and I just had to look hard enough. I'd dig through old totes in our basement, despite the terror of bats, birds, mice and hornets potentially assailing me, and basically wore myself down trying to find it. I used to play pretend that my giant pound puppy was a grown dog and his papa. I still have that one, actually, and keep it with my old baby blanket. Although the nose is damaged from my dog chewing on it many years back and it's missing its old red collar.\n\nI named it Sparky. I think my (deceased) uncle got it for me when I wasn't even 10 yet. I can't find the exact make, but it's [something like this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQYWkOpZIvAGc8wZS4_XPU6vj3KYinqdpA22Q&usqp=CAU). Very floppy ears. Soft. Used it as a sort of pillow supplement when I was a kid.\n\nI've lost a lot of stuff as a kid, though. Usually my parents selling it on me. My mother, actually. She sold my PSP out from under me even though I still used it and claimed I didn't. My brother eventually bought me a new one as a birthday or Christmas gift and even though I don't need it as much these days thanks to emulation, I still have it.",

The players used a deck of cards to move, attack and defend (along with other various actions) on a 3-dimensional Tavern with 2 levels and an adjoining Garden.  There was also a Palace Courtroom scenario.  I playtested with my gamer friends (and my bewildered non-gamer friends) for about 2 years, working out the glitches before I submitted my rules to various gaming companies, including Hasbro and Mattel.  I didn't have any luck selling it but my friends and I enjoyed playing it, anyway.  About 10 years ago,   I moved to a new house and started getting rid of stuff (as you usually do, when you move).  I asked my dad to give a bunch of books and old board games to Goodwill, while I was at work, one day.  Sure enough, he asked a friend to handle the transaction and he gave away the box containing the whole game, rules included (the box also contained several of my GI Joe's from the early 70's, that I'd been saving.  it was my fault for leaving it in my garage with my 'giveaway stuff').  I tried to track down the Goodwill location, over several weeks, but had no luck.  I kind of lost all interest in game design, after that day.",

            "text": "My wedding ring. My husband I got matching rings from six flags over texas. It rained shortly after we got there so the rides closed. We didn't want to leave empty handed so we searched for souvenirs. (We were dating then and this was our first really big day out together) We found this stall that sold rings, bracelets etc and the seller would hammer names into the jewelry. 60$ later, we had matching rings with our names together on them. We always wore them. 3 years later we got married and decided to make these six flags rings our wedding bands. We already loved them, they matched and we wore them like they were wedding rings anyway so it made sense. We've been married for 6 years (together for 11) and about 8 months ago I lost my ring. I lost it because I took it off to clean the house, which I usually did. It was a very simple metal ring. It got little nicks and scratches here and there so I tried to minimize the damage when I needed to do hands on work. Its just gone now. I've tossed the house several times trying to find it. My heart hurts when I hold my husband's hand and I can feel his ring still safe and sound, and I tear myself up for being so foolish as to lose mine. He's been so sweet about it though. He reminds me that while it is sad that my ring is lost, it doesn't define our marriage and I shouldn't beat myself up over it. At the end of the day, its just a ring. He has even suggested that we try to go back to that six flags just to see if the ring stall is still around. I hope all the time when I dig around nooks and crannys that it will show up. That maybe I was an air head that day and just left it somewhere unfamiliar and it got knocked under something. I wouldn't even mind never seeing any other items I have lost over the years. I just want my ring back.",

This was obviously terrible, since, well, that was the absolute best toy at the time.\n\nMy dad was a machinist, a tool & die manufacturer. He made me a new hand out of stainless steel, with a screw mount (rather than the hole in it) so we could maybe mount things other than just the plastic gun in it. It was chunky and weird, just a cube of metal with fingers cut into it. It looked very little like Optimus Prime's hand... but it did fit his arm.\n\nI didn't understand, back then. I wanted the actual plastic hand, not this ugly metal blocky thing, that didn't look like Prime's hand. \n\nAt the time Dad worked for Hasbro, making parts for the machines that made their toys. He finally convinced someone there to let him take one of the spare pieces - I had the hand back that I wanted.\n\nSomewhere in my late teens, after I and my parents went our separate ways... I lost the hand he had made me. It might still be in a box somewhere... but it's likely in that box of everything I lost.\n\nI didn't get it at the time, but that was the nicest thing he'd ever done for me. We weren't close, but he wanted me to have something he made. He wasn't an artist, he machined things based on blueprints that he didn't design. Frankly, he never really was artistic, never really created aesthetically beautiful things, just practical things. But he saw my despair over losing a part of a toy I loved, and designed and made me a new one - in his mind, a better one.\n\nAnd I rejected it.\n\nI didn't deserve that gift, and frankly, I deserve to have lost it.

I got one of the Star Wars vehicle cross section books and it was sooooo cool. I had also been collecting Sonic comic books for a couple years and kept them all in a shoe box in my closet. \n\nWhen I was 10 years old we moved. It was a big move, and we had a lot of stuff. When we arrived at our new home, I couldn’t find my Sonic comics or my Star Wars cross section book!  I looked through every box but it never turned up. I remembered putting it in a big box in my parents room when we were packing (I still have a hazy recollection of this memory) but it seemed to have never made it to our destination. I was distraught. \n\nFast forward about 13 years. My dad had passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. It was, and still is, a traumatic event. A few years after his passing we finally get a chance to go through his belongings and sort out the keep sakes. In a moldy basement, I open a big plastic tote and take out a shoebox. I open it up, and there’s my Sonic comics. I couldn’t believe it!  I literally couldn’t. I hadn’t thought about it in years but I had never forgotten how they just disappeared. And there, right underneath the shoebox, was my Star Wars book.\n\nMy dad must have taken these things, that I clearly treasured at 10 years old, and hid them away. I don’t know why. But I do know his dad did the same thing to him—taking little things here and there and hiding them for years and years. I’m mad he took them without telling me, but in an odd way it preserved them and although I would happily trade all of the Sonic comics and Star Wars books in the world to have my dad back, it brought some closure to something in my life at least.",

I had all of them backed up twice, one kept at home and one in the pocket (I had a tendency of losing my back pack so I made sure to keep it in my pocket so that I wouldn't lose it,) but on the last day of having my school laptop one of them failed and all of the data got corrupted. Couldn't be recovered. Don't know what caused it but for some reason it just decided to lose everything that was on it but still register as full so I couldn't even clear the drive and then redownload everything because it would just always register as being at full storage. \n\nBut hey whatever, I still had the second flash drive. Just needed to take it to school one last time because I was finishing up a project that day and needed to make sure I'd have it saved. After school that day my mom surprises me with \"we're going to go do volunteer work and clean up the lawns of those who aren't able to do it themselves.\" It's largely raking up yards and disposing of the leaves. I end up trying to lift this one bag of leaves into a truck but someone put a bunch of dirt in it as well so it's kind of heavy. The bag rips and the dirt pours out all over me. Annoying but whatever.\n\nI get home and go to copy the drive onto the computer at home. It's one of those flash drives with the retractable usb, I push the little button to bring out the usb and I hear a grating sound. Apparently when the bag of leaves broke some of the dirt got in my pocket and then some of that somehow got into the sealed part of the flash drive so when I tried to push the usb out it grated on the circuitry and completely destroyed it.\n\nBut hey it's fine, I've downloaded most of my files to that computer at home already, I lost only like the last couple of assignments right? Right? Hahahaaa..... Earlier that same day the computer blue screened while one of my parents was using it and it lost all of its data. In the span of a day I went from having 3 copies of all of the animations and photoshops that I'd done for the past two years to having none. Funny thing is I was going to use that data to create a portfolio to apply to an animation program for college which would've also included scholarships because my teacher liked my worked and helped set me up with someone he knew. Unfortunately with no portfolio the thing was dead in the water. I'm still bitter about that series of events to this day though honestly I'd just want the data because I genuinely enjoyed making all of those things.",

            "text": "My step grandpa's medical alert necklace.\n\nMy father's step dad passed when I was ~17. He was a Type 1 diabetic for 15ish years before his unfortunate passing. My family is fraught with divorces and second/third marriages but my dad's mother found her soulmate in my step grandpa Pat. They married after my grandmother divorced my \"real\" grandpa and remarried while my father was ~12. I loved him like all of my step grandparents and \"real\" grandparents and he was one of the kindest, funniest, and caring men I ever knew. He was a bright light of joy in an uncaring and miserable world, even when his own immune system said \"fuck you and your pancreas' beta cells.\"\n\nWhen I was 19, I was diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic. My grandmother was devastated, and spent as much time as she could by my side and even got me set up with his old endocrinologist, the best in our state. After I was out of the hospital and stabilized she gave me his old medical alert necklace that showed he was a Type 1 diabetic and insulin dependant. She also gifted me a new medical alert bracelet in case I didn't want to wear the necklace.\n\nI cried when she gave me his necklace. It was an ugly & gaudy brass necklace that looked like dog tags but I loved it so much, it was my most cherished possession for as long as I had it.\n\nIt made me feel closer to my lost grandpa and gave me hope that I could make it through my (literal) highs and lows of life and diabetes. I was and am a foodie. I've never been overweight but I god damn love food, drinks, and anything sweet. Getting diagnosed as a T1 diabetic broke me for a long time. I couldn't even get hungry/thirsty without being reminded I was broken and needed support. It was and is the hardest thing I've ever gone through in life and still deal with. It's a real mental drag to worry constantly about how your body will deal with everything from a disease to a diet. It's an all day monitoring situation that depends on everything from food to attitude.\n\n2 years after she gave me the necklace, me and a bunch of friends went to the beach for the 4th of July. We had some beers and a grand old time drinking, giving each other shit, and freezing our balls off in the ice cold lake before baking in the 90° heat of the beach. All in all it's one of my favorite memories of high school friends getting together and appreciating each other's company after we started drifting apart.\n\nIt wasn't until I went home that night I realized I didn't have my grandfather's necklace. I *lost* it. Literally and figuratively. I tore my room, my bags, my car, and bathroom apart hoping I lost it at home trying to find it. Alas, it was nowhere to be found. I cried my eyes out over it for the next week. I went back the next day and combed the beach for it. It's been 5 years or so since I've lost that necklace and I think about it almost every day. I've been back multiple times looking for it with metal detectors and I've never found it.\n\nI to this day haven't had the heart to admit to my grandmother that I lost her husband's necklace. It was suck a heartfelt and truly caring gift; to give me her dead husband's necklace after I fell ill to the same life changing illness that eventually led to my grandpa's death... It's too much. I feel unbelievably guilty and shitty about it and I just can't bring myself to do it and tell her what happened...\n\nOh but that's not the worst! That's still to come!!!!\n\n4 years ago I met the love of my life. We haven't been happier in our lives than just being together, and just last month got married!!! In March of this year, we were at my grandma's place fitting my wife's wedding dress since my grandma is an actual wizard with a sewing machine. After getting my wife in the dress, taking measurements, small talk, lunch, etc. my grandma asked us to wait before we left to go back home. She came out with 2 jewelry boxes. The first, for my wife, had a 24kt gold necklace with the diamond from my grandmother's wedding ring she wore while her and my grandpa Pat were married. I was in tears with my wife already for such a thoughtful and expensive gift. Then she gave me a ring box.\n\nIt held my grandpa Pat's wedding ring. She wanted me to have and wear it. I broke down and sobbed like I am now typing this up (I'm on minute 20 and tissue 5 typing this). We thanked her profusely and tried to tell her they meant more to her and asked her to keep them but she flat out refused, saying we would get more use from them than she would.\n\nI now wear my grandpa's wedding ring, and cherish it more than anything except my wife. I haven't let this damn thing out of my sight since I've gotten it and would protect it with my life. I can't believe how much of an irresponsible ass I was with my grandfather's jewelry in the past, and I will not make that mistake again. It's my most prized possession and I will take it to my grave. Love you, grandpa. Even if I couldn't keep your necklace safe, I'll be damned if your ring will get even a scratch!!!",

I drew the pentagram on his belly after watching that movie. He protected me, and I loved him so.\n\nI'm 33 now.\n\nWhen I was younger,  we lost a significant amount of material things to Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. Our home flooded two feet. Not much compared to others, but we really weren't prepared for it whatsoever, nor have we ever been very wealthy or on the good side of the dollar in this life. Dad was out of town at the time, Grandma & Grandpa were told to stay IN town because of the weather, (Grandma was fresh out of surgery, but only an hour away from her own home in Freeport), and we just kind of made do. I remember going out to our backyard and bringing the canou inside so I could put my pillows and stuffs in to sleep, along with my little beanie baby teddy bear. Grandma was put in the tallest bed and was safe, little brother already had a bunk bed, so he had no idea anything was going on, and Mom and Grandpa were just like, \"Well... Fuck. Who can sleep through this?!\" (Me. I could... and I did for a bit). Then I remember the next morning, walking along side the canou, next to Grandpa and Mom, with Grandma, my little brother, and my Teddy inside of the canou, qs we walked chest deep out to the front of the neighborhood, to meet my older sister so she could take us to her home for the next few months. \n\nWe lost SO MUCH.\n\nI helped Dad rip out our walls once he got back; we had a game plan. We were on the road to recovery.\n\nWe cut 4 feet of drywall and bleached everything to repair and rebuild. Mom and Dad slept inside, and my little brother & I were sleeping in a ratchet ass motorhome that was in the driveway. AC and all, we weren't suffering... Dad thought we would be wealthy enough to one day go on glamorous camping vacations with a motorhome we were going to be able to afford to repair somehow.. It wasn't awful, but it was to the point that even I knew at such such a young age, that Mom knew it was a pipe dream.\n\n -sorrysolong-  \n\nI came home after a birthday party one of my friends had the September after, and there were only a few rooms fixed in our house. My little brother didn't want to sleep in the motorhome alone while I was away so he slept inside that night on an air mattress, and when I got home, I took a shower inside the house, left my important stuff in the motorhome, including Teddy-\n\nANDTHEMOTHERFUCKINGTHINGBLEWTHEFUCKUP.\n\nMY STUPID STUFFED SPRAWLED-OUT-ON-HIS-TUMMY BEANIE BABY BEAR THAT WAS MY EVERYTHING, DISINTEGRATED. I LEFT HIM ON THE CORNER OF THE BED. I GAVE HIM A KISS ON THE HEAD BEFORE I LEFT FOR MY SHOWER.\n\nI WAS SUPPOSED TO COME BACK TO HIM. I TOLD HIM I WOULD BE RIGHT BACK.\n\n...we also lost a lot of home movies and important family stuff in that fire. The guy that was selling the motorhome to my Dad, (who was supposed to be a good friend of his), told him he had no insurance on it, but then ended up collecting on it afterwards. We got nothing.

Because I have torn my house apart, up and down, scoured every hard drive, thumb drive, memory card, portable game device, basically anything with a storage medium and can find no trace of this supposed Bitcoin wallet. Nor can I find any record in any of my email addresses related to any purchase (although I have about 20 different emails). \n\nSo I'm telling myself this never actually happened. \n\nAnd yet... the email address that I would have most likely used to make the purchase, I can no longer log into via Google. I know the password, but Google won't let me log in without correctly guessing the recovery email address. And the hint that it provides (the first letter of the address and the first two letters of the domain) coincidentally happens to match the email address of someone I used to work with, someone who wasn't always 100% scrupulous. And despite all the circumstantial evidence in the world that I own that email address, Google won't let me in. \n\nSo.... yeah. I'd find that possibly non-existent $250k worth of Bitcoin.",

Went to the rest of my exams, went back to the school of music 3 or 4 days later to clean out my locker, noticed the lock wasn’t completely on the locker and my saxophone wasn’t in it. \n\nTo this day, I couldn’t tell you if I set it down and accidentally walked off without it. If I put it in my locker but didn’t close the lock all the way and somebody took it. I checked everywhere I could imagine and asked every person in the school. I’m assuming that someone stole it.\n\nI did end up reporting it as stolen and I had insurance on it so I was able to replace it, but still… I have no clue what happened to it.",

Her proudest possession was her \"Queen's Pin\", presented to her upon graduation.  She ran rehabilitation hospitals for many years and had one dear employee, Mrs. Cook, who had never been able to get her LVN license.  My mother struggled with breast cancer, and she died on November 5, 1975, 46 years ago, today.  Mrs. Cook was devastated.  I had the Queen's Pin, among my mother's effects, and my siblings each wanted it.  As executor, I gave it to Mrs. Cook, who was deeply, deeply touched.  That was many years ago, and she is long-gone.  From time to time, I wonder where my mother's Queen's Pin is.
