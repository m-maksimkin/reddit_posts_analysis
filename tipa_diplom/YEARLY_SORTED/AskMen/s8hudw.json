I said come on now I just want to hold her real quick give her a kiss bye and I’ll give her right back to you.  She got a crazy look in her eye and as soon as I made the move she pulled out the meat mallet and smashed my knuckles in, breaking my hand and sending me to the ER. I still have to deal with her occasionally since we had a kid together, I’ve since moved on and I’m in a much better marriage. But we are still fighting over just partial custody.  I found out how misguided the justice system can be as well, especially when it’s a man that’s abused by a women. One day people will realize women can hurt men in situations of abuse just as much as men. Men just don’t like to admit that they were victimized by a women. That’s why it took me so long to actually get help, I never called the cops even when I bleeding and she was really hurting me not just physically either. I was too embarrassed to do anything, I was embarrassed I couldn’t handle it myself. When I did stand up for myself she threw me out on the street and destroyed all of my possessions…literally all. Anyhow I still have a long way to go, but my daughter is my world and she’s going to know it if it’s the last the I do. I wish she could just see that we are in this together and stop lashing out at what should be her partner. I’m surprised she hasn’t gotten herself locked up, but she’s a nurse and knows how to make up a story. That only gets you so far though. Be careful out there. My daughter has a half brother, my son from my current marriage. He’s almost 2 and she’s never even had the chance to meet him. She wasn’t the one…",

I WANT a family girl, BUT this was a bit ridiculous. Since we were in college, not much time spent w family. But she was older so she graduated much earlier. When I’d go visit her, could never have a dinner or activity alone, family always had to be included. Literally every time. She also was rather traditional Jewish, me an atheist. The religious difference was null, never a problem, BUT she wouldn’t/couldn’t eat most of the things that I liked most. Found myself struggling to enjoy meals, and I’m a huge foodie. Was a great relationship otherwise, but I fell unhappy over time.\n\nSecond: Great relationship at first, horrible by end. Gorgeous girl, still love her to death, but our opinions on essentially everything were polar. She also wasn’t trustworthy. She often lied about stupid things that I knew were lies, and a couple times made some big lies. She also had a major attitude problem, and from my experience I believe she was bipolar. I have several friends with clinical bipolar diagnoses, and her behavior seemed similar if not worse. Not a big deal generally, but she refused to even consider changes in her behavior. I never ONCE mentioned to her that I thought she was bipolar, isn’t my place. Ultimately ended around start of COVID. \n\nTHIRD: My post-college relationship. Sweet girl. Lot of things up here. Loved her intelligence, her drive, her goals, and her family dynamic. Issue came down to her being rather controlling but at same time absent (wanted a lot of space, at a year in she still was insistent on only seeing me two to three times a week). She was busy with law school, so understandable, but she’d frequently bail on plans with no good reason. She also was rather selfish, never seemed to care about how I felt about anything, and outwardly said so a few times. Only cared about how her decisions would impact her. Yeah I also live a “put yourself first” lifestyle but I still care about the feelings of those I’m close to, particularly someone I’m dating. Trust started to erode after a while, not specific to any event but just her being dismissive. This one just ended this month, so not quite two years yet but just shy a couple months.",

I was 23 she was 22. We’ll call her Ashley because that’s her name. Ashley refused to fly to St. Louis because she was scared. Not of flying but of being at the airport alone. \n\nSo my dad bought tickets for the both of them, and the plan was for them to fly here together and we’d all hang for a few days, my dad also having a friend in STL made things convenient for all. \n\nSo the night before the flight she calls me and starts a fight over absolutely nothing. Then proceeds to tell me she won’t be coming to St. Louis. I was so fucking infuriated because she had no respect for the money my father had spent, the hotel rooms we had already booked and I was currently at waiting for her, my time, my fathers time, the amount of planning that went into the trip and activities, but most of all that she would shun the egregious effort my dad was putting into make sure that his son and girlfriend could spend time together because she was afraid of navigating airport gates. I couldn’t believe the selfishness and how willing she was to pretend that my father wasn’t doing a massively unnecessary favor for her. It was a hundred red flags rolled into one.  \n\nI wanted to fucking scream. But I know the only way I could salvage the trip was to be as nice as possible and bend over backwards to make her feel like she was on a god damn pedestal, so that’s what I did. \n\nShe did come, I never told my dad about the near miss, but when she got here that’s when I realized we all would have been better off if she had stayed in Boston. Spent the entire three days texting her ex, a guy that was perfectly nice but she had been bouncing between us for about a year. I knew about him, he knew about me, but we were young and both infatuated with Ashley. And neither wanted to give up and let the other guy win. \n\nIt was the most toxic relationship I ever had. Her cousin was my best friend and he warned me to stay away, I never listened, and she dragged me through so much horseshit over two plus years I can still taste it between my teeth. \n\nI’m a twice deployed Marine and I had to listen to her arrogant prick of a father tell me “I should have joined a real branch,” meanwhile he did four years in the navy as fucking **mechanic.** \n\nBefore all that had even happened, she refused to come to my boot camp graduation, and the night I got home for boot leave she had an excuse not to meet up with everyone, all of us being in a very close friend group. \n\nThat was about 12 years ago and I’m still single. I’ve had a few relationships that were all much better. I’ve had a couple girlfriends treat me extremely well. So as much as my time with her sucked complete ass, what I learned was that I was worthy of more and there are so many kind and beautiful women that won’t treat men like shit.",

I used to believe there’s no such thing as bad sex. Then I dated her. Nice lady, good cook, but the bedroom was bland.\n4) she was nuts. She wanted me to rescue her half the time and the other half she wanted me to go away. \n5) this one was a super sweet lady, good in bed, fun to hang with, nerdy in all the right ways. But one day I was leaving her house to go home and looked at her and the spark was gone. She just didn’t excite me anymore. Like a switch flipped. Dunno.\n6) this one had low self esteem. I would boost her ego, encourage her, praise her successes. It became a full time job and I already had two of those.\n7) it was her insisting we wouldn’t be accepted by her family or community (racially different). So, we had a great and fun relationship behind closed doors but weren’t allowed to date in public. I wanted more than tv and screwing.\n8) this one had a large age difference that finally caught up. \n9) this one wanted me to be a “tv boyfriend” along the lines of the Brady Bunch or some lame sit-com from the 70s. And mixed signals- talked up porn and sex parties to the point of discomfort for me. Then when I would later mention them, she would freak out and scream and cry.

My childhood best friend was murdered and when I went to my home city for the funeral, she moved out. Didn't tell me she was moving out, didn't tell me she had rented an apartment on the side.

But now she can't afford her half of the mortgage cuz she is paying rent at her secret condo.\n\nWhatever. I forgive her. She says she says she'll sublet her apartment and move back in. She never goes through with the sublet so I just paid her half of the mortgage too while she built equity in the house.\n\nAfter 8 months or so of her not commiting to me and still spending some time at the other place I went ahead and had the mortgage refinanced in my name only and paid her back her equity. \n\nShe maintained that we'd be together eventually.\n\nI called the wedding planners for a question I had.

The reasons:\n\n-Moved too fast; our relationship went from 0-60 in nothing flat. Physically, emotionally, socially. By the end of the first month, we we had already met everyone’s friends and socialized everyone, and I wasn’t even ready to be official. I should’ve spoke up, but I thought I’d see where it went….\n\n-very different love languages; she wanted beaming “sink into each other’s souls” romance. Looking deep into my eyes just for the sake of it….. I get it if that’s your thing, but it made me uncomfortable. \n\n-last but the most not least…. I wasn’t attracted to her; I thought all the right things on paper and her having her life together would make up for not really being my “type.” But it might have been the biggest factor, and it makes me feel bad and shallow. \n\n-compatibility; we kinda played house for a day, and I got more annoyed than anything by it. She worked from home, I was off that day…. and I just didn’t enjoy that being our life, cause I couldn’t imagine my life with her. \n\nShe wasn’t a bad person, and she tried very hard. But the little emotions that make up the whole picture of the relationship weren’t there for me, and the result was that I wasn’t falling in love with her. I tried, but it was making things feel forced. I decided to end thing before they went any further than they already had. It’s not fair to lead someone on like that.

I just kept trying to “fix me” to save us. When things only got worse, I became suicidal.

I eventually did, but it was the most painful experience of my life.\n\nAfter the fallout, I discovered she’d been fucking one of her new work buddies for quite some time. They had a pretty extensive social media presence she kept well hidden until I finally broke down and packed up and left when she didn’t come home again. \n\nTo make this story worse; not only had we been together for over 10 years; we had been married (too young) after high school, had two kids, divorced, and got back together after 16 years apart.

When I did try to be more open, she didn't like what I had to say (see previous point for an example)>\n\n\\-She used \"breaks\" for a couple points in our relationship. Granted one of them was when I was fired for a job that was my own fault.\n\n\\-I was trying to get into blogging. However, because I wasn't doing a huge marketing campaign before getting into the habit of regular content creation, I was made to feel I was doing it wrong, which in turn it helped kill my interest in blogging.\n\n\\-We had gone through 2 couples counselors. The first guy she agreed made me feel like I was being interrogated while she didn't get a lot of follow up questions. The second counselor I liked more, despite a couple faults because he tried to be a little more balanced and understood what it was like having ADHD (he and and I both have it). I have a suspicion she didn't care for that approach. \n\n\\-At one point, she said we needed to talk. I offered to take a break, since we weren't in a good place. She wanted to break up. She was surprised I didn't want to for the relationship when I said ok to breaking up. \n\n\\-We went through a lot of drama since we were stuck on a lease for another 6 months post break up. The final straw where I could never be with her ever again, let alone be friends, was when she mocked my dad getting sober. \n\nShe helped me deal with my dad going to rehab since it was one of the toughest things I had to deal with as an adult if not my entire life. It was the one of the few things I still had any appreciation for in the relationship and she used it to make a mocking comment because I was calling her on her snotty attitude during an argument. \n\nMonths later she finally got the hint that I wanted my space, despite a mutual friend reiterating how I felt.",

Now, I had just graduated college, and got a job two hours away from the college town she grew up in (and I had just left).  Her family was  not well-off, and the city had a great public transit system...so she had never gotten a drivers license.  So seeing her meant driving 100 miles and crashing on my old roomate's couch.\n\nA month or two into the relationship, I started to realize that we would only do things with MY friends, and she never actively participated - like if we went disc golfing, she just tailed along and carried my discs for me.  Didn't actually play.  Despite having grown up in the city, we never went and hung out with her friends.  Everything we did was based on me, what I had going on, what I wanted to do.  Where I wanted to eat, what movie I wanted to see.  I started realizing her entire identity was \"E's girlfriend, K\", not \"K, E's girlfriend\" and I didn't want a shadow in life that would tag along and always be just behind me, I wanted a partner that would walk beside me, or lead when I needed her to.  Ended the relationship, and she tried like hell to get me back, going as far as applying for jobs in the town I then lived in.\n\nMy suspicion about her personality were confirmed after she transferred back to the college I graduated from and started dating another guy from our circle of friends - an overly self-confident, self-assured alpha male asshole type, and I watched her personality change to match -- but she was still always his shadow.\n\nBullet.

I told her how one of my friends wives complimented me on it and how it made me feel great. All she responded was \"Well maybe you just shouldn't care what other people think\".

In the very beginning she went on a school trip out of state and broke up with me to hook up with a woman trying to understand her sexuality. I have no problem with that but I should’ve taken the red flag before jumping back in. Little later her drinking problem was starting to show. I have no problem with my significant other going to parties and having fun, shit we’re only young once. But damn be responsible. When she’d drink she would always get black out drunk. Her friends weren’t really any help as they would more often than not leave her alone at said party. I mean come on, the world we live in. She’s a very small woman and that’s just dangerous. Those nights would end up with me picking her up at 4am on a school/work night and have us fighting because she felt like I wasn’t in the relationship and how I only wanted her for her body. She would constantly try to have sex with me before hand then preceded with violence and anger when I’d reject because how intoxicated she was. She later said that it was her drunk self testing me. Often times she would threaten to cheat on me when she was drunk then get mad at me for getting mad at her. She would wake up the next morning with no memory of what happened and be upset at me for being upset about what she did the night before. We would constantly break up and get back together with me always seeming to be the one trying to keep things glued together. It was always me. You would think that I would turn around recently when she stopped drinking, stopped the fighting and started to think of us long term.  But Reddit. After two years of fighting. I’m tired. I feel like shit because she feels like I’m not fighting. Like I haven’t been fighting hard enough. I feel like my heart is already swayed away. I feel like she isn’t the one anymore.

I guess you could say it was when I realized that she wasn't going to get any better. \n\nShe had an abusive childhood and had a number of bad relationships in the past, and came into things projecting a lot of issues onto me. Her last ex before me was a serial cheater, so she was constantly on the lookout for warning signs. Lots of little things like that. I tried to work with her and address her concerns, but any time it involved her communicating or her working with me it was like running into a brick wall. It was incumbent on me to change myself to accommodate her, but she couldn't put any work in. We basically just kept living the same fights over and over again, and it just got completely exhausting. She wanted the relationship to be perfect 100% of the time, got upset when it wasn't exactly the way she pictured it, and then would double down on being upset instead of working to address problems. She wanted a happy relationship without the effort.\n\nAnd then she had another ex who sexually assaulted her and that ex randomly DM'd her one day. Obviously very triggering and upsetting, so with hindsight I totally understand where she was coming from. But in the moment she didn't tell me about it, or even just like a \"I'm going through some shit and could really use some support\". All I saw was that one day she suddenly lost interest in sex, and she started to feel more withdrawn and distant. And when I tried to work on things with her we just kept running into the same brick wall again. And that gets exhausting and frustrating, and then she would get upset that I was clearly upset, and it became a vicious cycle.\n\nAnd then we just started fighting all the fucking time. And any time I tried to stop, and address things, and to work through things like an adult, it was like it just made her angrier and the fights started again and got worse. And somewhere along the way I slowly started to realize that this is just kind of who she is, and it wasn't going to get any better. Not without professional help that I don't think she would've accepted anyway.\n\nOh and I mean things were over by this point anyway, but there was another guy. Not while we were actually dating so far as I know. But one day after we started fighting all the fucking time I started noticing someone new pop up on all of her socials, and it was not long after I noticed she was spending time somewhere new when she had her location on. So of course I look this guy up and he lives on that same street. And he just very obviously had a crush on her. It feels kind of stupid to articulate the logic in detail, but it was the most obvious thing in the world that this guy was into her, whether or not she was into him. And I asked her straight up, is there someone else, is it him? And she insisted that no, there wasn't and no, it wasn't, and that he was the neighbor of one of her coworkers (this part was true) and they had hung out in like group settings because he was friends with her coworker (also true), and that that was also why she was going somewhere new, because she had made a new friend at work and was hanging out with said friend who was the neighbor of this guy. And honestly I just kind of took her word for it. This guy was definitely crushing on her, but that doesn't mean she has to reciprocate, right?\n\nAnd then like three days after we 100%, officially, cut things off and ended things instead of just arguing all the fucking time she went and hooked up with that guy. Which I found out because I came over to get some of my shit and he was there. So that was a fun capstone.",

            "text": "She cheated on me after 5 years together. I forgave her, and tried to push through to keep the relationship strong. She developed super bad depression, and just seem like she gave up on the relationship all together. I still tried, but it started to feel like I was just coddling/babysitting her when I was with her. Then the guilt tripping began whenever I didn't want to be around her. She started to try to say she would kill herself, or that she had already attempted to kill herself. But still I pushed through. I loved this girl with all my heart, and wanted to make a life with her. \nEventually, things seemed like they were getting better. She started seeking help for her depression (beyond just prescription drugs). She got off social media, and actually seemed like she started caring about the relationship. Occasionally she would still try to gaslight me, or guilt trip me, but I'm stubborn and would call her out on it, and she seemed to reflect on that behavior. \n\nWell, things started to get weird. She began to say that she wanted me to finish inside her, to know what it feels like. (We were still in college, so I didn't want a kid at all). I tried to explain to her that I was not comfortable with that idea at all, but she said that she knew when her \"safe days\" were and it would be fine. I knew that was bullshit, and refused. She had always been religious, but knew I wasn't, and used to respect that. Well, after the previous incident happened, she said that she wanted me to talk to her priest, because I \"needed spiritual help\", in understanding her and her desires for a family and our relationship. \n\nThis royally pissed me off, and she began saying things like \"I need to be with a good Christian man who will fulfill my desires and wants\". So I told her to go fucking find one, and that we were done. She fought back, crying and begging me to stay, but I had had enough. She tried to blame me for \"breaking her heart into thousands of pieces\". I shot back that she had broken my heart when she cheated on me, but I fought through the pain to try to make it work. \n\nTo end this already long story, she eventually apologized to me a few years later, but at that point it was too late. That experience has fucked me up. I have trouble trusting women in relationships, and get way too clingy because I'm afraid that they will hurt me again if I don't give them enough attention, which then usually causes the relationship to break off. I can't seem to get it up with women either. I always get too nervous about my performance, or if she is going to try to \"trap\" me inside her, and usually go limp. Which then in turn has given me massive self-confidence issues in terms of sexual performance, and so for the past few years I've purely focused on myself and other relationships, and have not even bothered pursuing a romantic one. \n\nI tell me friends and family that it is because I want to improve my own self and life first (I'm broke af lmao), which is true. But also, I'm terrified of what might happen if I fall in love again. \n\nI'm sure alot of this sounds over dramatic, and I'm sorry bout the long rant. I didn't mean to go off like this, but it all came flooding back and I needed to get out, and anonymously is usually the best. Sorry again for the rant, and thanks if you've read this far.",

What threw everything under the bus was the kissing stoped. Small things pals. The dates stoped. Here’s the kicker. When we “broke up” on the 7 year we both worked on ourselves and found ourself meeting once again. After that She kept called, texting, and even visiting from time to time. I Was still working on somethings when she asked if we could friends. Finally, I agreed under the condition that we remain friends at first. My intentions was to master some skills since she was my high school sweet heart and I needed some time to take on a providing role.  She would give me gifts, she would offering to buy me clothes, and offer to give me rides. I didn’t mind, but now that I had some grip on my life I had higher standards and kept certain boundaries in place that weren’t their my high school years. One word sorta of destroyed the whole thing. She started arguing again once she thought we were close said a big f bomb and from that point it was pretty much the end of an 8 year long speal. Some time after I met another lady on a trip with some friends in Indianapolis and it was black and white. Completely two different types of relationships. She was kind and understanding. She was very articulate with her words. Mean while my last 7 years was filled with cursing, talking about rappers, and such. One was lively and loving the other was hatful and only spoke ill of others. At that moment I was completely over and understood that she wasn’t the one(I say this because I still had to see her from time to time) Nothing like a good old compare and contrast to help you realize that there are many out there and my then ex (which was my first girlfriend) was completely out played and it only took another lady 30 minutes to show me that.

I broke up with her because I wasn't feeling mentally healthy and because I felt like I might never have a chance to be young and single again, and she was moving next year to go to law school so I should just get it over with so I can live a wild single life again. In hindsight, I broke up with her for all the wrong reasons, I was a bad boyfriend at the end where I was letting the feeling of existential dread make me run away from her rather than hold her closer.\n\nAll that being said, afterwards some people pointed out that they saw her treating other people poorly. She shamed someone who was her friend for being promiscuous and getting a boob job. She is an ally through and through but she \"hay guuurl\"d my one gay friend who doesn't talk like that at all and asked him about his ex, her friend, even though he usually just wants to talk about Mario Kart. Her best friends in the world, whom she was going to live with before we broke up, got yelled at for hanging out with me and when I said sorry they said \"I really don't care, she's been such a bitch\". \n\nAfter we broke up, we stayed \"together\" until her lease ran out. She confronted me about me sleeping with someone when we broke up the first time (Ross moment) and not telling her. She was in the right, I should've told her, I lied because she hated the person. But she came into my apartment unannounced at 2 am and woke me up to yell about it for hours, but when all was said and done in the morning, she told me that she slept with someone a week prior. We were broken up and didn't talk about it, but we were still spending time together and sleeping in the same bed and saying I love you. I was too stunned to yell, I think I blocked it out, I just said \"that's okay\" hoping she'd let my thing go.\n\nIt's been a process, but I'm slowly realizing that she was my soulmate in every other aspect, but I realized that she only treated someone well when she was dating them. She was genuinely a kind person, but there was something going on where she felt that if she wasn't completely secure and in control of a relationship with someone, she was under attack and had to attack back.\n\nOne thing I will say: please don't assume you know everything about her. I was a bad boyfriend, she was generally a kind and caring person, and despite my 24 page paper on the subject, there is so much nuance that is hard to explain.\n\n**TL;DR:** I broke up with her to be single for my last year of college, but in hindsight she was treating others poorly and that has made me okay with her blocking me.",

We took 2 breaks in our relationship in the past 2 years, agreed that we both would communicate better, but that never happened.  It’s not truly her fault because I lacked in communication as well but the pettiness was crappy… also I never met any of her friends, even her best friend who is a guy that she would hang with when I didn’t spend time with her… he lived 10 minutes from me???\nPart of me felt like she had a secret life that I didn’t know about but I’ll never know.

There were no previous mention to me of these feelings. She had been a bit distant the week before she told me this (which wasn't too uncommon, she has mental health issues she refuses to get help with and this would occur somewhat often just not to the extreme it did) and after she got home from work one day I kept asking what was wrong because it seemed worse than normal, and she just said she needed to be alone meaning single.  \n\nI was/am heartbroken and still haven't received any sort of meaningful explanation or even apology. We lived together so I am dealing with breaking the lease (cant really afford without her), packing her stuff, cleaning the house, and transitioning our dog we raised together to where I am going to be living. While leaving at first she said she didn't want to lose me and gave me the classic \"its not you its me\". We have not spoke much since she left. Yesterday her friend reached out and let me know she is basically pretending the past 4 years didn't happen and does not want to talk to me or see me. Her friend (who I really appreciate reaching out) told me she doesn't deserve all I did for her and she does not know what is going on with her, because her behavior seems erratic at best since the breakup. Not like sleeping around or anything but, literally just pretending nothing happened. \n\nShe has always pushed her problems to the side and pretended they weren't happening (they would either go away or I would help her fix it), and this seems to be another one of those situations. She doesn't want to acknowledge what she did and I will be honest the first few days I thought she would come back and we would work things out, because again this was out of nowhere. At this point when I look back at all I dealt with to try to make her happy these past few years just to have her leave me anyway without warning, it is for the best. She made me happy sometimes and we had fun, but I don't think I could have maintained the way I was living for the rest of my life and couldn't imagine starting a family with her unless she got her issues sorted. \n\nI'm currently working on myself as much as I can and know I'll end up better off in the end. Maybe this was a blessing in disguise as much as it hurts, I really don't think I can take her back ever.",

For one reason or another ;-D \n\nWhat got me to realize I was done was when I was gaming one night and missed 30 calls from her. My friends said you have to answer after twenty calls lol. Long story short, she drank four locos on an empty stomach, punched her safe and broke her hand. I drove across town to pick her up and on my way over there I told myself this is it, just be done with this relationship and explain why.  I drove her to my house because she refused the ER. I explained that we are in different places in our lives, it has been fun but not healthy and she needs to better herself and not be so spiteful to things in her life. She seemed to be getting it and I pulled into my driveway. I opened the door for her and closed it behind her ... This is where shit hit the fan.....\n\nShe looked at me intensely and yelled, \"aren't you going to let them out?!?\" I said \"wtf who?!?!??\" And she responds with \"The person you were talking to on the way here!\" I have never dealt with anything like this and it honestly freaked me out. I got her into the house after saying ok but let's get inside.\n\nShe quickly ran around my house locking all the doors and freaking out about possible people coming to get her and was not making any sense. Complete psychosis and it actually scared me to the point I thought oh man am I crazy?!?   \n\nI told her to snuggle me and we did. That way I was able to tell her to match my breathing of my chest and she eventually passed out. Next morning it was like nothing ever happened. We broke up that day over explaining our relationship ECT.",

So I thought I’d be able to help her through it, but for anyone who has ever dealt with depression you know it isn’t something you can help someone recover from unless they genuinely want to change. \n\nSo now I’m in this relationship with a girl who I’m pretty certain is the one for me but I can’t do a thing to help her out. I’m not sure what to do now cause I know keeping this going for an extended period of time will only make the inevitable that much harder. I want to believe that she can get better but I’m scared of slipping back into old patterns and falling back into depression.",

Her being rude to retail workers then blaming their work ethic, got fired from a side job that she was constantly insulting her coworkers at, lots of small events that happened pretty normally but she just invented details of people attacking/insulting her, lots of weird stuff.\n\nI confronted her about it, and her reasoning to me was, almost verbatim, \"well, sometimes I see things differently in my head, but that becomes truth to me so that's what happened.\"  I didn't even know how to respond.  Tried to help her find help, but she just refused it was a problem.\n\nI'm really glad our social circles don't overlap at all.  I'd hate to think of the stories she's been making up about me.",

So one of us would likely have to sell off we got married.  I have trains for my place since I lived in the metro, far more career options here for both of us.  Multiple zoos, theme parks, theaters (all verities), etc.  Which not only good for us, but great for kids too.  She lived in a small town, with no to few career options for me, and mostly nothing to do.  It has only a movie theater.  She really just wanted to stay in that town because she was super dependent on her parents.  \n\nFor marriage we both described what we wanted.  I'm not religious and she claims to be.  Her wedding plans sounded like it was strait out of a poorly written teenage romcom.  She wasn't interested in my ideas because the wedding day was \"her day\".  Perhaps passive aggressive on my part, bit I told her \"when you get married, make sure to invite me\" to which she laughed \"you're going to be there\".\n\nAnd then for kids, she had all the names picked out.  I got no input.\n\nIt was obvious she was stuck mentally around 16, when she sort of peaked.  I told her, I don't think she actually was in love with me.  Nothing about her plans for the future included me.  Shortly after I broke up with her.",

We argued all the time towards the end, and she had accused me of always being negative and never seeing the positive in anything. We had a friend who was having a hard time with immigration because he was a Dreamer, and she would constantly talk about the problems he was facing. We were at brunch and I said something like \"that really sucks, I wish it were easier for him\" and she suddenly start talking about why we have immigration controls and why things are the way they are. I just stopped talking to her that day.\n\nHearing her laugh for the first time in months - one of the reasons I think I fell in love with her in the first place was that she laughed loud, often, and easily. But at some point, she stopped laughing for me, and then stopped laughing around me. And it was like music was gone from my life, as lame as that sounds. It disappeared so gradually that I didn't even realize that it had been missing from my life for so long until someone else made her laugh, and the sound broke my heart. \n\nThere's more, like realizing she only ever criticized and never recognized or uplifted, not sleeping in the same bed, no intimacy, not spending any time with me, the emotional affair, and not being willing or able to speak to me about any of this or make any effort towards changing things, but I think the point is made.",

If it wasnt about those 3 things, she couldnt talk about it.\n\nThe day that I woke up was at the aquarium. She LOVES fish so I figured it would be a great thing.

When I looked at the pic, I could see how unhappy I was and that this is NOT the life I wanted. \n\nAbout a week later, she wanted to have a \"talk\". It was about  us and our issues.

Then she’d text me saying she missed me and implied that I was always too busy for us, or that I flaked on plans too much. \n\nThere was a lot of other stuff and eventually, she canceled our plans and we never made any others. We never officially ended things. We just both went our separate ways. A couple of years go by and I’m watching Modern Love. There’s this episode with Anne Hatheway and it’s all about mental illness and I saw so much of my ex’s behavior that I’m fully convinced that’s what was happening. Maybe it wasn’t me. Maybe there wasn’t someone else. Maybe it was just she couldn’t bring herself to get out of bed that day.",

She was very manipulative and wouldn’t end a fight or discussion until I had apologized. She was super jealous and would interrogate me if she knew I had been near other girls (friends, acquaintances, coworkers). When I started at the University the newcomers (me included) all went on a team-building trip for a couple of days and was told while going there, that cellphones were not allowed - since they wanted people to mingle and not focus on anything else - and that we had to hand them over upon arrival. I had made sure to text her that I was going radio-silent because of this and not to worry. When I got my phone back at the end of the weekend I had around 15-20 missed calls and a ton of text from her. She went over the top this time and said she was sure that I cheated on her, and the only reason I had went radio silent was because I was using it as an excuse to mess around with girls. She said she needed to have some time without me and that she was going to a friends place (female friend). She ended up cheating on me with a guy she knew was digging her.\n\nStupid as I was I ended up forgiving her.. Fast forward a bit and she breaks up with me, and says she needs to find a new place to stay - I had provided everything financially so I knew she would have trouble finding anything, so I gave her some time to search. She ended up staying at my place for far too long, and it was the most depressing time of my life. I had a hope of patching things up and she was manipulating me into believing it could - until I went on a vacation (with my family without her) and comes back to finding out she fucked her ex-boyfriend in my bed.

            "text": "Lease was almost up, so it was time to start packing for moving day. Ex gf really wanted to make the 2.5 hour trip to see her mom two weeks before moving day and hadn't started packing yet. She didn't drive, and wanted me to drive her. I was a little annoyed, but said \"fine, we'll make a 1 night trip tomorrow if we do some packing today\". Ex is happy, spends like an hour packing.\n\nNext day I drive 2.5 hours so she can visit her mom, am informed after dinner that my ex isn't coming back with me the next day. Her mom will drive her 2.5 hours back two days after I've moved everything to our new place. Ex says I shouldn't worry because she did some packing so it won't be that bad for me to do everything. I'm mad, but I head home without staying the night. I look over ex's packing job. She packed one box. I call her and tell her that the box she packed is the only thing of hers I'm bringing to the new place, everything else she abandoned for me to deal with is headed to the dump. She freaks out, hangs up on me, ignores my calls, shows up 2 days later courtesy of her mom and she's furious that I \"ruined her summer vacation\". \n\nNext few days she begrudgingly packs and cleans while mostly giving me the silent treatment. Moving day comes and she's somewhat civil again. We start moving her boxes and I discover she has only folded them and hasn't taped anything, so her boxes are exploding everywhere while we're hand-shoveling contents back into them and taping them as we move. In front of everyone helping with the move ex furiously screams at me that this wouldn't have happened if I had let her enjoy her vacation.  \n\nI'm surprised it lasted another 3 months before I found out she was cheating and the breakup happened. In hindsight I think she was off to catch some dick in the weeks leading up to moving day and used her mom at least partially as a cover",

He had to be put into a coma and my intestines became extremely swollen and I couldn’t be awake long enough to go to work anymore.\n\nTurns out she was poisoning our vape juice. She was my life insurance beneficiary and had full access to my business and investing accounts.\n\nShe then got a restraining order on me while I was in the middle of moving out. Police made me stop and leave immediately without anything. Couldn’t get my wallet or anything so I had to be homeless while I waited on family from across the country to come help. By the time they arrived and we got the police department to help me get my stuff, she had already stolen or destroyed everything of mine.\n\nI tried to get a restraining order and press charges, but her dad has friends in high places because he is rich (won the powerball before). So I was essentially laughed out of the courthouse. Even my mom couldn’t believe their complete disregard for what was actually happening. I presented all of the evidence from doctors and chemical analysis, plus my new escalated state of heart failure. Nobody would do anything. The states attorney told me they don’t prosecute victims.\n\nAbout a week later she takes a safe full of guns and drugs to the police department and says it’s mine. They continued to harass me and my family over the next year. It got so bad I had to just move states to avoid the law harassment thanks to her and her dad continually making shit up trying to get rid of me.\n\nI forgot about this too, she called up my ex wife and told her I had put a hit on her. Also spread rumors about me being on drugs causing me custody issues.\n\nI’m just a software engineer and literally all I do is go to work and sleep. I had taken this girl on vacations all over the planet for months at a time. She didn’t work or clean or do anything. I did all of the cooking, cleaning, paying bills, etc.\n\nI literally tried to be the best boyfriend possible, still almost got murdered just because she wanted access to my assets.\n\nThe fun part is she is still free and I still have police calling me.\n\n\ntldr; Tried to murder me and and my best friend. Destroyed all of my belongings. Brought illegal stuff to the police department and told them it was mine. Chief of police is her dads friend.",

I got gaslighted she said “i was drunk, I don’t even remember what I said...” the second time, she got way drunk, she got mad at me cause I was talking to her gay friend about some irrelevant thing, she took that as “I don’t tell her anything about my life..” and then after she was arguing with me in public all the way back to her apartment, she slapped my temple, knocking my hat off my head and ripped my shirt open saying “give me back my fucking hat, and my shirt” (they were gifts) I stated I wanted to go home, she didn’t want me to, she got sad and wanted me to stay and I became mean and said bad things to make her move cause she wouldn’t let me, and I didn’t want to get physical cause I don’t hurt people. We agreed to take a break for 3 weeks, I needed space. I came back and I found out she acted like she was single, claiming she was to her friends and parents, her Instagram stories and posts were blatantly showing that. Her parents didn’t condemn her behavior, or I think they didn’t know what all of what she did. When I came back she said I was the dick and her actions were justified by me being an asshole. \n\nAfter another 2 months, she came back at me again about how she only got this apartment because her parents wanted her out of their house to be in this relationship. But like very early on in our relationship her parents wanted her out anyway, and I didn’t even meet her parents yet and they were still wanting her out. I felt like she was guilting me by saying because she’s doing all this for me I should be paying $500 dollars a month to take her out for dinner/drinks on top of when I would buy groceries to cook for her, but I still lived with my mom...and I didn’t plan to move in with my girlfriend because there was so many things that were negative. My girlfriend basically said, “the only time I’m here in the apartment is when we are here together, otherwise I’m staying at my parents house.” \n\nMy mouth dropped down and I couldn’t do it anymore. Two days later i broke up with her. She claimed I was emotionally abusing her because I wasn’t having sex with her in two weeks and wasn’t attempting to want to see her. Like wtf, you’re such a mean person why are you ruining our relationship? So many memories, so many good times, but she was just such a mean person. It sucks, I’ve tried to move forward, I wrote a response for closure cause when I said we should break up, she hung up the phone and immediately blocked me. It felt like everything we did meant nothing to her. I already have depression, and I was doing so well with it, and now with all this I’m so sad, I don’t care about school, I don’t care about my hobbies, my work. I want to cry almost every night. I hate being alone and lonely. Idk boys, so yeah that’s when I realized my girlfriend wasn’t the one\n\nEdit: $500 a month, not a week.",

For anyone who actually wants any details this only happened because her brother needed to use her phone and she was bragging about how easy I was to handle and that no one ever had to worry about me ever again to some guy she had been seeing while I was with her up until recently. He took a few pics from his phone so I could see her phone case for proof. He just wanted to apologize to me and told me he would talk to their family but I told him I wish he had just left me alone and let me hate myself with what I thought was my truth so I blocked him.",

I couldn’t even hang out with my best friends even my family because she would always want me to be texting her and if I didn’t respond after about 10 minutes she would call asking what I was doing. She was never interested in sexual activity, even on vacations. I was actually thinking of marrying this person and she wanted a custom made ring that was at least $5,000. After all that I decided to wait and see if things would get better, well, they got worse. After she told me she might be poly and can only stand about 5 minutes of cuddling with me, I couldn’t do it anymore. I moved out and within a year I got 2 raises at my job, have a stable bank account, am able to see my friends and family and things on my own like a normal human being, met a wonderful, loving and caring woman, bought her a $500 engagement ring at JC Pennies and she is as happy as can be, which makes me the happiest man in the world right now.",

Every 45 minutes I will get a phone call asking how I’m doing and if there were any girls there. After a while I got sick of her constantly interrupting my one night out and just told her that one of my friends had brought A whole sorority house over and there were drunk naked bitches packed shoulder to shoulder in the place making it really hard for me to finish painting my miniatures. \n\nIt ended when I was upset with how she have been treating me, being rude and dismissive and taking her frustrations related to her work out on me. She hung up on me. I tried to call her back and she did not answer. I did not call her for a whole week and then that week of silence I realized that I was so much happier. I called her after that week and told her it was over. \n\nThe best part? She had already graduated from college and was worried that I would ditch her for a younger and prettier girl.

I literally won the fucking lottery. And we cross paths with my ex at one point during a funeral for a mutual friend. Minus the cheating, her worst fears had come true and I was a little bit bitterly satisfied over it.",

Over time she just became less and less grateful for the things I did. I’m a student in college and she isn’t so she was working and making money. But she was living with me in a place that my parents owned with no rent or utilities to pay. This wasn’t enough contribution I guess. At the start of the semester during Covid all of my classes were online so I was doing work from home while she was working as a manager at a fast food place. Well me being home all the time was too much so I let her strong arm me into getting a job to make money that I didn’t need. Turns out the money I made was solely used on her.  Eventually we go on a trip to florida and had a huge fight and I realized I won’t marry someone who will get into a huge fight with me while we’re supposed to be having a great time. I let it go on a bit after that for 2 months because I didn’t know how to break up with her. But she started being more distant first and one day woke up and told me she was going to join the military and that the only way we could be together is if I went with her wherever she went or get married. So I took this as the breakup and we broke up. I don’t think she expected this because I moved all of her stuff out and I was hurt for a while but she’s moved on with new trashy dudes and never went into the military. I’ll be getting my degree this winter and going into law school. I think she dated me for my future prospects anyways, I felt like a financial piggy bank for her for most of the relationship",

I had only ever been to her place once, but it was when she lived in the same town as me. She moved away only a few months into meeting her, so for the majority of our friendship, she lived in another town.\n\nFor background, I am ANALLY clean. I vaccum daily, dust everything, make my bad everyday, etc.. All of my friends and family know this about me and give me shit about it. She, being a friend of mine for so long and being to my house many times, definitely knew this about me.\n\nFast forward like 3 months into dating. She had decided to move back to the town I live in to be closer. I said that I'd help her out with moving, and she was super resistant which I thought was strange. She kept saying that her house was dirty, and although I'm extremely clean myself, I don't have much of an issue with someone else's general messiness. I don't expect EVERYONE to vaccum daily, or make their beds. She eventually folded, albeit reluctantly. \n\nBy the time we got there and she asked me to stay behind while she went up was the first sign that something was up. I wait downstairs for maybe like 15 minutes, and I'm wondering what's going on. Eventually, she comes down and says that it's really messy and she's sorry. What I saw when I went up was one of the most shocking things I've ever seen.\n\nI come up, and see that there is literally no clean surface in the house. The whole apartment had probably a solid foot of piled up trash/clothes/dishes/whatever. There were about 3 chairs and a couch, none of which were clean. There was one cleared out trail, probably about a foot wide, that ran from the entryway of the apartment to the bathroom. The whole apartment smelled like cat pee, the mattress was stained and disgusting. The dishes were piled up and food was just left out.\n\nIt was at that moment, I knew I fucked up.

She was incredibly clinically depressed and I think that whether or not she had ill intent or disinterest, it came off that way sometimes- like suddenly falling into a bad episode and disappearing (not responding at all to her friends and I) and since she had a complicated home life, I couldn’t walk up to her door. There were times she had to be put up in a hospital for a few days after saying her goodbyes and nearly succeeding in killing herself. \n\nShe ended up breaking it off when we went LDR saying that she had met another guy. At the time, I hated her. I felt like we had weathered everything for so long and suddenly, it was over, and she had rubbed salt in the wound by telling me it was another guy. Then a month later, she contacted me again and told me that she had been trying to push me away so I wouldn’t have to deal with worrying whether she’d suddenly kill herself one day. She wanted to date again. At the time, again, I was still upset about being dumped and I thought it was BS, and she just got deprived of attention. I told her I wouldn’t start anything again, and we were done for good.\n\nNow I’m older and things feel a lot more ambiguous. I’ve made it a personal rule to look for the humanity in everyone instead of assuming anything. People do things for messy, weird reasons. Especially people who have a mental illness. I don’t know the reasons any of that went down, but as long as it’s my best guess, it’s healthier to assume the best.",

Massive mistake on my end... \n\nNotable red flags in hindsight for Reddit's delight...\n1) didn't want to call each other bf/gf or signif other, thought it was a term for children. Ok brush it off and move on\n2) didn't want to try any home workout or jogging together (i.e. gyms closed) as her 'thing' was live spin class and she shouldn't have to adapt. When confronting her that there was no timeline for gyms/studios to reopen, she indicated not her problem she shouldnt have to give up her goto. Weird and disappointing but okay let's keep going.\n3) got laid off before meeting me due to shutdown. Not her fault (I assumed) as she got packaged out. Details slowly creep in including from fam that it was performance related. Not a problem persay, it was the lack of consistency in the story I was getting\n3a) she gets an email one day from old boss (also female) politely telling her to close off her time at the company on LinkedIn (it was pushing 3-4 months after and was confusing some people given the role title). She goes into panic mode for several days. Maybe something traumatic there so try and be sympathetic, ultimately she can't provide me with reason. Ughh nothing to work with here but okay.\n3b) we work in same profession so I suggest we take some of the same professional development courses online that are of interest to both of us (mandatory plus we both were thinking about slightly pivoting in our field) I.e. a couple hours each week at night. Straight up refusal, this is her time off and it should not involve anything stressful. \n3c) I pay for a service to help her work on her resume and do career planning that I have in fact done myself before and would recommend to my most successful friends. She is insulted and says she's doing just fine and she'll start working again on her terms. \n\nRed sirens screaming at this point\n\n4) Over the ~6 Month experience, alcohol consumption increases to 2 bottles of wine a day min, sleeping increases to 10-12 hours a day, waking hours become allocated to pokemon go and or trial and error instagram filters. FML\n5) near the end of said 6 months, either chatting on couch or random digital zoom calls with friends and there gf's she is unable to form complete sentences. Ums, ughs every other word and literally can't find anything meaningful to add to convos that were geared to her interests.  I raise this as we started relationship with super deep intellectual conversations, not that were super smart just highlighting her ability to converse and command over English language plummeted without exercising her brain. She was oblivious to the change.\n6 + final straw) wrote out a long letter consolidating all the concerns I had raised in past several weeks and begging her to get some therapy (with or without me).  She goes on defensive and takes letter as a personal attack. \n\nGame over, the greatest people in my life have had at some point taken me aside and told me some stuff they knew I didn't want to hear but needed to. Knowing they were risking there relationship with me and others, they still proceeded to giving me that feedback (regardless of what I would do with it). Ultimately I think covid lockdown broke a lot of people, myself included in less ways, but this isn't the last lemon life is gonna give us, and I know now that I want people in my life that want to at least get back on the horse.\n\nThanks for the free vent Reddit, maybe I'll get annilated now in comments.",

She didn't sound the least bit ashamed or anything, like she thought it was totally fine. \n\nI can still remember the look her father gave me from across the room that could only have been a sympathetic apology. And the momentary shocked stare her mother gave her behind her back. \n\nWe argued that night about it, and she refused to see how it was cheating to meet some guy in Norway, dance with him in a night club, then give him her number, and keep chatting with him for months afterwards.

Told myself a few weeks in to turn off my mental redflag/warning system (I have a habit of self sabotage and creating mountains out of mole hills). Massive mistake on my end... \n\nNotable red flags in hindsight for Reddit's delight...\n1) didn't want to call each other bf/gf or signif other, thought it was a term for children. Ok brush it off and move on\n2) didn't want to try any home workout or jogging together (i.e. gyms closed) as her 'thing' was live spin class and she shouldn't have to adapt. When confronting her that there was no timeline for gyms/studios to reopen, she indicated not her problem she shouldnt have to give up her goto. Weird and disappointing but okay let's keep going.\n3) got laid off before meeting me due to shutdown. Not her fault (I assumed) as she got packaged out. Details slowly creep in including from fam that it was performance related. Not a problem persay, it was the lack of consistency in the story I was getting\n3a) she gets an email one day from old boss (also female) politely telling her to close off her time at the company on LinkedIn (it was pushing 3-4 months after and was confusing some people given the role title). She goes into panic mode for several days. Maybe something traumatic there so try and be sympathetic, ultimately she can't provide me with reason. Ughh nothing to work with here but okay.\n3b) we work in same profession so I suggest we take some of the same professional development courses online that are of interest to both of us (mandatory plus we both were thinking about slightly pivoting in our field) I.e. a couple hours each week at night. Straight up refusal, this is her time off and it should not involve anything stressful. \n3c) I pay for a service to help her work on her resume and do career planning that I have in fact done myself before and would recommend to my most successful friends. She is insulted and says she's doing just fine and she'll start working again on her terms. \n\nRed sirens screaming at this point\n\n4) Over the ~6 Month experience, alcohol consumption increases to 2 bottles of wine a day min, sleeping increases to 10-12 hours a day, waking hours become allocated to pokemon go and or trial and error instagram filters. FML\n5) near the end of said 6 months, either chatting on couch or random digital zoom calls with friends and there gf's she is unable to form complete sentences. Ums, ughs every other word and literally can't find anything meaningful to add to convos that were geared to her interests.  I raise this as we started relationship with super deep intellectual conversations, not that were super smart just highlighting her ability to converse and command over English language plummeted without exercising her brain. She was oblivious to the change.\n6 + final straw) wrote out a long letter consolidating all the concerns I had raised in past several weeks and begging her to get some therapy (with or without me).  She goes on defensive and takes letter as a personal attack. \n\nGame over, the greatest people in my life have had at some point taken me aside and told me some stuff they knew I didn't want to hear but needed to. Knowing they were risking there relationship with me and others, they still proceeded to giving me that feedback (regardless of what I would do with it). Ultimately I think covid lockdown broke a lot of people, myself included in less ways, but this isn't the last lemon life is gonna give us, and I know now that I want people in my life that want to at least get back on the horse.\n\nThanks for the free vent Reddit, maybe I'll get annilated now in comments.",

And man, after being married for over a decade I haven't dredged up these memories in a dog's age.\n\nOne was a long running catfishing thing, middle aged housewife pretending to be my age & single - back before the term \"catfishing\" existed, like 2002 or something?  I was in the service, so it was just a mutually enjoyable fantasy sexting outlet for awhile when I was stationed overseas between '98-'01, but when I came back stateside and asked about meeting up - she had the decency to not ghost me.  We stopped talking to me when she felt \"used\" and I honestly couldn't respond to that.\n\nWhen my ex-fiance, who was working in another state, for a job out of college didn't call for two weeks...  I took that as a sign.  At least she gave the ring back.  And to be fair to her, I had let my insecurities get the best of me and definitely said some shit that torpedo'ed the relationship long before the actual break-up.  Still though, she was just hyper career focused - like \"I'm not willing to walk the two blocks to your on campus apartment for two weeks prior to finals.\" levels of \"relationship's on hold, I'm busy.\"  I can understand, \"Hey, I'm going to come over and pass out for cuddles and leave as soon as I'm awake - got shit to do.\"  But radio silence?  Meh. \n\nThe most interesting one before meeting my wife: So before I went to grad' school in another city, I's looking for something casual in the last few months before heading out.  \n\nI met a girl because she posted she liked a book that I had also read, \"Sex, Ecology, and Spirituality\" - which is basically a 1,200 page, 400 pages of footnotes, academic tome.  I quickly realized that she did not quite have the intellectual horse power to understand it...  And then she ghosted me on a pretext to go to Vegas and fuck and do coke with a guy who she liked fucking better than me, but called me a month later since he ghosted her & I was a better \"do over\" for her ex who chose heroine over her, she still wanted a shot and I was content to let her be a cuddle buddy because a warm bed's better than a cold one *but* who wants to fuck someone who's negatively compared you to their ex'?  \n\nAt the point when she got pissed about asking her to leave to go back to her place for a break - honestly so I could rub one out in peace after three days - well...  I decided that it was finally time to just suck up a month or two of loneliness before I moved over having someone who couldn't leave when asked.  I'm not into pity sex from someone who dislikes my technique; which is the only complaint I've ever gotten from a my admittedly small list of partners.",

We lived two completely different lives and I think overall I just wanted her to live a life she didn’t want to live.\n\nShe left back to her home state but still wanted to make things work long distance wise but the damage was already done from her leaving so in turn I left her. Months after the healing process still endures, a year and a half of trying to help dig someone out of a hole and then still try to live your life is so mentally exhausting. \n\nDating a new girl now, we have some things in common and are both successful, can financially support ourselves and we both have college educations. Things are kind of rough right now but trying to see if things will work. After being in a year and a half with someone after seeing red flags, then being with someone that is similar to you and has goals, you kind of start “looking” for red flags lol.\n\nAnyways things are going good now, and I hope this brings hope to whoever reads this.

First one was just a major flirt but we were young and it wasn't that serious so whatever. \n\nSecond one was a lot more serious but we just had different life goals, she wanted to be a mother and I didn't want kids, especially not right out of school. That and she started getting a little too close to another guy, which shouldn't have surprised me since she left someone else for me. Not exactly the most loyal type I guess. \n\nThird kind of fell apart after her mom walked in on us. Really sucked because that felt like the one and I never really got over her. But I never really pressed it because of distance and dating someone else already. There were also some issues of me being overly jealous and possessive but I grew out of that. \n\nNow happily (most of the time anyways) married. \n\nNothing is ever perfect but it's the ability to communicate, trust, and be willing to change (on both sides) that makes it work. If you can't be open with eachother, can't trust eachother, and can't change (within reason) it will never work long term. \n\nThere's a couple others but not really worth mentioning. One we were just a rebound for eachother and realized there was no chemistry and stayed friendsish. Another wasn't a choice but family issues, mine didn't approve and that made it impossible to see eachother so it was better off to just end it.",

I recently heard that the guy she’s been dating since me finally got wise to it, too, and left her dumb ass. I need to find that guy and buy him a beer.\n\nWith another, I didn’t realize until long after we had broken up but had a lot of unrequited feelings between us. We got to talking about our relationship, and I pointed out how her treating me like I was beneath her wasn’t cool. She doubled down in essentially saying “Yeah, but I AM too good for you.” And I realized she never has and never will respect me, no matter what I do. There’s a whole lot more baggage that came out in that conversation, but the pure lack of respect for me was the nail in the coffin for any feelings I had left for her.\n\nAnd for number 3, it was that she acted actively repulsed by my touch. I’m not super into being touched either, but to cringe at your partner trying to kiss you one time a day is a little bit of a slap in the face.",

She didn’t even acknowledge it despite my clear joy. Needless to say that joy quickly dissolved that day, she was not best pleased it seemed. \n\nTold me work was more important to her than anything else and she had broken up with her ex during busy season which was around the corner as if it was some sort of threat. \n\nGave me a lecture about how calling her “love” meant something different where she was from and I shouldn’t do it (she was from Russia still have no idea what the fuck that meant or what relevance where she was from was). To me calling a girl I like love was a term of endearment and didn’t mean I was confessing my undying love for her or some shit. Anyway I respected that and never challenged her on it despite it being awfully strange to me. \n\nTelling me I could not go out with her and her friends then drunk texting me at 3am when she got home telling me that she was “soo confused” for what I could only think was because I wasn’t at her place waiting for her.  \n\nGaslighting me into thinking the toxic culture at work was fine and that I should shut up and accept it cause in her view the place we worked could do no wrong. \n\nCalled her once to vent about work. Asked if I wanted to speak to our People leader in the office rather than listen, sympathise and try to help. Later that same day insisted on coming to my place despite me telling her I could not see her because I was so swamped. If she was swamped though I just had to deal with it and leave her alone. \n\nIntroduced me as a work college to a stranger who approached us in London to donate blood a few weeks after we got together. \n\nGot angry when I told her I didn’t want to speak about work when she kept bringing it up on a Sunday. \n\nCasually suggested that she was only with me for sex on several occasions. \n\nNever ever offered to pay for anything. \n\nShe kept an absolutely from filthy house. The kitchen and sink often was a stinky and horrible mess. When I stayed with her I did my best to clean up and help her clean but it was a recurring theme. \n\nShat on me for not replying to her for a few hours while I was busy, proceeded to ignore me for days while I was out of town a few months later. I ended things the next time I saw her when I got back. I made my decision on the plane when reflecting on all the above. \n\nNeedless to say I learnt a ton from that experience, not least of which do not date someone from work let alone someone who values work above all else. \n\nThe sad thing is it was my first real relationship and my first physical one. 2 years later and I’m still not over her. I still think about her often and I sometimes feel like me ending things with her was premature. I know deep down I did the right thing but it’s hard being alone now. She used me for sex and place to stay close to work when it was convenient for her (I literally lived down the road from the office. She lived in another city) \n\nI recently tried to reconnect with her and she has Ghosted me ever since I told her I was coming back to London (having moved out of the UK for around a year) before that she was happy to get the attention. When I told her I was coming back she said she had a boyfriend. The months before that she was happy to chat and get attention from me. \n\nShe says she is a better person but she is still a horrible and toxic person based on her interactions with me and how she conducts herself.

It was only a matter of months before I hardly saw her anymore due to her constantly attending events that made me cringe. I tried to participate for a while in an outside kind of way, maybe play a song now and again for a fund raiser or event and such. But having a pretty skeptical mindset made it really hard to stand next to people sincerely calling on the cardinal directions and lighting candles and chanting without crawling out of my skin. It’s hard to watch someone you’re so close to so suddenly and deeply believe things so entirely at odds with your outlook. These people thought they were employing magic. I thought it looked like a scene from “Waiting for Guffman”.  I was never derisive of it, and I did my best to allow her space to experiment with spirituality. \n\nAnyway, I couldn’t hang only so frequently at those outings, and she just got more and more frequent about it. I became pretty invisible pretty quickly. Like a roommate you don’t see that often. \n\nThe real question is why it took me so damn long to DO something about it. She ended up cheating on me with a guy who obviously shared her new beliefs and was there… you know… at every event. When I wasn’t. \n\nIt was inevitable in hindsight, and I should have bailed before the obvious occurred. I guess I just had this optimism that it would all work out or be a phase of something, and months crept into years. Fours years of slow dissolution. \n\nLesson learned.",

Fast forward to her crying/getting upset and her telling me she would never insult me for my looks. I brought up my recently bad haircut, and all she could do was deny and gaslight.",

Sure, my ego took a hit after getting dumped, but it certainly wasn’t the end of the world. And while we had a lot in common and there was somehow still a lot of good, she was an attention-craving backstabber.\n\nI would’ve liked to have stayed friends maybe, but she sealed that fate when she got with a guy the same night it ended. And then later went ahead and got with a dude I know. It reminded me how “classy” she really was.\n\nCrazy thing is idk why I needed a reminder. She was always that way. She was an embarrassment to me, and one best forgotten about. Regardless, she was a chapter in my life that taught me a lot about myself. I’ll still value her for that.\n\nCouldn’t be happier now!\n\n(Just in case you’re reading this, it’s all cool M, I fucked the girl you were worried about.

She dismissed the idea but then added that she was sorry it didn't hit the back of my head. We were arguing over money issues. \n\nI was the only one who was working and at the time I had around $7K in the bank, which I had used to pay the bills and buy her stuff. As soon as the money was gone, she started to get demanding with the money I was making from work. \n\nI should mention she was on worker's comp at the time and waiting for her lawsuit against her former employer to be settled. She just saw me as a FWB and although I didn't expect or want her to spend any of her settlement on me if she got it, I wouldn't have turned it down. \n\nIt's difficult being the only one paying everything and eventually I got behind. We had one big blowout and she told me to get out. I told her since I was the one paying, she should leave. She refused. So, I left and haven't seen her since She contacted me in 2020 and wanted to know if I claimed her on my taxes in 2019. \n\nI told her no and she demanded proof. I photocopied the section of my tax form where I would've claimed dependents to show her I had no dependents. I didn't tell her I had filed electronically, but I hadn't claimed her. She wanted to be able to get the $1200 that was being given to help people with the Covid-19 pandemic. I could've claimed her on my 2019 taxes as we had broken up in August of that year. But, when I claimed her on my 2018 taxes, she wasn't much of a help, only adding $500.\n\nI don't know where she is and I don't care. I'm with someone else now who is the exact opposite.

She was going on a trip to go see her friend out of state for a week so I was going to do a day trip to a nearby national park with my friend. This was met with yelling and “It’s like you’re dating HIM and not ME. Why don’t you date HIM instead?”. She posted a snapchat story about how she was looking for a sugar daddy, and apparently me saying that could be misunderstood was some sort of crime or something. I got a great high paying job and she showed no happiness or support. She said she had never had a healthy relationship, and from what I can tell they never lasted more than a few months.

            "text": "Back when I was a senior I dated this one girl for 3 months. She used to live in the town I'm in but lived probably 45 minutes away (her family eventually moved once we had started dating) Once her and her family moved here things only got worse for us. For some reason or another she never wanted to tell her family we were dating. I had no problem with her wanting to spend time with her friends but like anytime I tried to make plans with her she'd already have plans with someone else to do. She went through depression but instead of letting me be there for her all she wanted to do was get drunk at parties and self harm. We just kept drifting apart even when I did get to see her she always seemed so disinterested always on her phone. She wanted me have abs, big muscles, different haircut,  bigger this etc. Conversations went from super busy to one worded replies there was hardly anything she really liked about me anymore and it was destroying me inside out this was my first girlfriend btw. Eventually she reached her breaking point and wanted to go on a break blocked me on everything. My high-school best friend texted me saying \"Hey have you saw Kari's snapchat?\" I told her no I got blocked on everything. I saw on her story she had 2 guys over one I knew definitely was her friend the other guy and her were taking lots of pictures together. I knew the guy went to his Instagram and saw they had eachothers name with hearts in their bios. I confront my ex and after awhile of her bitching me out we were finally over. The guy dumped her a month later and me and him are completely cool.",

My GF called me before I started, so I figured it would be fun to do one each at the same time, and see what we each thought. One of the questions was “do you think gay couples should be allowed to adopt kids”. I can’t remember if she asked for my answer or if I asked for hers, either way, her answer was absolutely not, because being gay is a sin and kids shouldn’t be raised in a house that’s built on denying gods word. I knew she was religious, but I had never really had deep interactions with a fundamentalist before, so I was really unprepared for that answer. Eventually the whole test thing devolved because I asked her if she thought all people in the US should be forced to be Christian, which she said no to, but did said she did think it they should be forced to follow its rules. I asked her what the difference was, and how she meshed that with religious freedom, and she said at the end of the day she has to vote her morals and her morals are Christian. When I tried to respond, she told me she didn’t want to talk about it, and that I shouldn’t talk to her like she’s a bad person. I broke up with her a week or so later because she mentioned wanting kids and I had a full blown panic attack thinking about having someone like that around my kids, and I don’t even want kids. Turns out all my friends and family hated her so I guess that’s a W, wish they would have told me earlier though.",

They then run a dozen tests on me, I cannot process reality. $25k later they finally give me one .25 Xanax. It helped a little. They take me to a dark room and told me to lay down.

I thought that was the reason she was with me initially, but eventually everything mellowed out and it was fine…too fine. Year goes by and I noticed she’s talking about other people and girlfriends she met and just a whole lot of different activities. Nearing The 3rd year it hit me…I hadn’t been paying attention at all to her. I was probably an asshole even (she said I was the nicest guy she’s been with post breakup, but I figure I was an asshole since the things I remember most during that time was playing videogames with my siblings!). Eventually, she calls me and breaks up with me over the phone. Easy breakup. Still, I guess she wanted a more dramatic ending so she calls me a week after (we have sex) and we get back together. We finish the 3rd year and we’re done. It stayed the same, just disinterest. We kept in touched (we were friends before hooking up) and it turned out she was lesbian. She called and told me worried that I might get angry. Initially I was shocked and worried (what the hell did those 3 years mean?! Yeah they suddenly meant something, lol) but after the initial shock and discussion I was so happy for her. Anyways, I realized she wasn’t the one when my thoughts and activities weren’t on her (so much so I missed a very important detail!). I knew I wasn’t doing right by her and so I said enough (for both of our sakes). Turned out Mother Nature actually said she/I weren’t meant for each other. So that was that and last we talked she was getting married. \n\nThe 2nd (which came after) was a crazy experience. I was in college and she was go-getter. Very smart and just full of energy. Anyways, we talk and got to know each other and next thing you know she’s holding my hand and just making all the moves. She eventually proclaims me her BF to friends and professors. I have to admit I wasn’t cool with it, but I also was stupid at the moment. I wanted to be with someone so I rolled with. Eventually I did find myself falling for her and she never changed her attitude. She was always there and just an awesome personality…then she started to get too close with other guys. Initially I just took it as “friendly” attitude she showed for a better part of 2 years. Every time I would ask about certain guys she would just play cute and make out with me. It was easy to just let everything slide. I was a dumb dude when it came to “sex” I learned the hard way. Anyway, the moment I realized she wasn’t the one was when one of my English professors pulled me to the side and gave me a pep talk. At first I found it odd that she was giving relationship advice but it hit when she alluded how “bad relationships start rotten when they’re built on a lie.” She went on discussing about liers and I knew she was coding things as in she saw my GF (her student too) do something behind my back…like my previous GF I probably didn’t see the signs that were in my face, but thanks to my good professor I knew she wasn’t the one. Odd thing is my ex #2 didn’t want to break up…like at all. Eventually we did and in less than a month she was already hooking up with someone. \n\nAnyways, I ended just not wanting get into a relationship and so here I am. Feels good though!",

We’d been dating for about a year. Her makeup was always flawless, and her outfit was always gorgeous, and her room was so full of things. Tiny potted plants, live ammunition, alien books, and animal skulls. So full of things. Her laptop, some old piece of shit she refused to get rid of, was covered it stickers. Exactly what you’d expect a graphic designer’s laptop to look like. One day, it finally died. She could pay $200 to fix it, or just buy a new one. She caved and bought a new one. She was so sad about losing the old one, because the stickers she’d amassed couldn’t transfer over.\n\nSomething about that kept nagging at me, couldn’t stop thinking about that old laptop. Laying next to her in bed while she slept, thats when it hit me like a freight train. I realized her room was so full because she wanted it to appear full. She didn’t care about 90% of that aesthetic garbage, she just cared about how it made her seem to visitors. She could only view her life through the lens of how she believed other people saw her. I was nothing to her. I was a utility, an item of function, which she had placed layer after layer of stickers on. I wasn’t important to her, not really. At the end of the day I was a replaceable tool. Like her laptop or her room, it didn’t matter what my characteristics were, so long as I preformed my basic service in her life and had plenty of room for decoration.\n\nShe woke up soon after I had this epiphany, and you know what she said to me? She rolled over and she fucking said “I had a dream that you were going through all the stuff in my room, and throwing it all out.” I felt sick.

For context I was loving in LA at the time) \n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you wanna be my lover - you gotta get with my friends.\n\n              ====================\n\n(A two and half year relationship)\nI spent over two years meeting her almost everyone who knew her. Her family, extended family, her sibling's in-laws, friends, family of friends, family friends, and friends of friends. She worked at a coffee shop and we'd often hangout with some regulars who became good friends in both our lives. I spent many holidays with her family. Random trips to visit some of her family in Palm Springs every once in a while. Many times spending birthdays with various family of hers. I felt I had my fair share meeting those she cared about. This is worth saying, but not a factor that led to the end of our relationship - we went to many of each other's friends' weddings together and I enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nShe met my immedaiate family when they came to visit me once or twice and I take into account my most family (immediate and extended) live in different different states than us. Also I tend to be independent so I don't see the family that live within a few hours of me often. \n\nFirst time we had the chance to go to a gathering of my family about 45 min from us, she bailed. As in we had planned to go, but the day of, she canceled. I didn't think much of it, I knew she easily got anxiety and felt that was the case. I gave a reason to my family in a way that protected her why she couldn't make it. Then, after some time and when things felt right, I had suggested visiting , we made plans to visit some of my family in Colorado. Things seemed solid, but she canceled and I told my family my schedule didn't work with my schedule, but I hope to make a trip out sometime.\n\nThen little things got to me like comments she'd make about my best friends and roommates at the time. But I still held her in high regard and to her credit some of my roommates at the time were dumb asses who had some maturing to do.\n\nFor a while I justified her reasons for not wanting to spend time with people I really cared about. But I also had a group of really good friends who were very mature people I looked up to. I was the youngest in this group and felt like their little brother (as most of my family was away). They served as a surrogate family for me in many ways and I treasure the time I spent with them. \n\nI got to bring her to a few of times we all hung out, but she almost always had another social obligation that same day and I ended to leave birthdays and parties and going aways for some of those friends early to attend a thing she had with other friends of hers.\n\nThe \"dad\" of that group made a commented noticing why GF at the time seemed to bail on game nights and outings we had. This was when I realized something was off in our relationship, but had no way of knowing how to address it. Then I went to visit my parents on the east coast (grew up on the west coast, but mom got job and took them to the east coast around the time I started dating my ex) and the final few pieces fell into place.\n\nParents asked me a bunch of questions I didn't really have answers to, but saved face in the moment, internalizing how I was really feeling, because I wasn't sure I wanted our relationship to end and was probably afraid of talking to them in the moment because I would have realized it was pretty much over. I can normally share anything with my parents, but I didn't want my time seeing them for the first time in a year and a half to be a moment of tears, followed by a long flight back to CA. \n\nAfter the last wedding we had RSVPed to, we talked everything over and broke up. I had accepted a job that required me to move. This seemed to be the catalyst needed for the real conversation we needed to have. We talked about long distance, but we both knew we wanted to politely break up and not cause drama for our friends as many of our friends had become close to each of us. \n\n              ====================\n\nFast forward a year or so, I was talking with a mentor at the time, joking about how I am glad to be single and making the big bucks. Getting to save and buy things I want - like a homebrewing system and a new PC i built. He cut straight through my facade and asked, \"regarding your last relationship - did you have fun?\" \n\nI got to think about it and thankfully with a clear conscious say, \"Yes, I really enjoyed the time I spent with her - every moment. I have no regrets. She showed me so much about the world and myself I would have never known. However, I do also enjoy being single now.\" He said how all that really matters in past relationships is that you actually enjoyed yourself, otherwise it is time lost.\n\nThat conversation brought me the final bit of closure on that relationship and I chose to be so verbose in this comment incase anyone is in a similar boat. \n\nFast forward two more years and I found out she's married and on the East coast. If you have a glass near by, please raise a toast to her and her now husband's good health. Probably never going to see her again in my life, but she was an important chapter of mine. A chapter that has ended, and now I'm deep in a new one. \n\nThanks OP for this question, it feels good to talk about this. Only like 2 or 3 of my closest friends have gotten the full story, others don't really ask.\n\nIf anyone is feeling down and read this much - hit me up, I made a playlist that helped me find closure and I am so happy to share it with anyone who needs some tune to sooth any breakup pains. FYI It is a Spotify playlist.",

But I had been hurt a couple times before and kind felt like I just had to be happy with what I got.\n\nIt began as a lot of fun, us going out to the bars for a couple drinks to see friends most nights.  Pretty normal college town stuff with an active social life.  Until I started to realize she could easily put away 1.5 liters of wine a night.  She'd get pretty drunk and we'd have little fights that she or I would apologize for the next day.  And then it was every night.  All the drama finally got to be too much, so I tried ending it.  \n\nBoom, pregnant.\n\nInstead of straightening up, her moods spiralled and the drinking got more out of control.  I'm talking S.H.I.T.T.Y. drunk.  It was a mess.  She was also a heavy smoker.\n\nWe finally sat down and talked.  I told her I was concerned about the baby's health with all the drinking and cigs. She said she didn't intend to quit anything and didn't want to be a mom.  So you know where that went.\n\nA few months later and of course it's no better.  I was trying to move out of the apartment and she's screaming at me, blocking my way.  At one point she pulls a butcher knife on me.  Total circus.  I get past her and keep loading my truck.  She's standing in the doorway screaming, telling me to never come back.  \"You'll never find another woman like me again,\" she yells.\n\n\"I hope the hell I never do!\" I called back while jumping in my truck.  Poor truck had a couple dents and a broken passenger mirror after that one.  She was not amused.\n\nMoral of the story: don't settle. Ever.\n\nSide notes: I'm not trying to make her out to be a villain.  She was and is sick and there wasn't anything I could have done to change it.  I hope she's in a better place now.\n\nI'm absolutely crushed about the abortion and it's something I carry with me every day.  Feeling both guilt and powerlessness is a tough road to be on.  \n\nAnd for anyone out there living with an alcoholic or addict- you don't own those million little criticisms and angry words.  You don't deserve the verbal and physical abuse.  You are not damaged property.  That's not love.  Someone out there will love and care for you just as you are.

Unlike a lot of other entries here, my ex didn't wrong me in any profound way. When we parted, she threw some scathing insults at me over things I didn't do or think, but that didn't really have any lasting effect.\n\nThe relationship was one-sided mostly due to her having several severe mental illnesses, so rather than an ideal dynamic of mutual care, it was usually me caring for her, rather than vice versa. Because she was prone to sudden mood swings, I often felt like I was walking on eggshells when with her. Mental illness is tough to navigate, so I don't necessarily blame her for the way she acted, but it could be emotionally draining to be around her sometimes, and it made the relationship feel like a chore.\n\nPeople like her definitely deserve love, and I hope she finds someone right for her. To me, though, a relationship should be mutualistic, and dating someone with the illness and baggage she had just isn't right for me. There's nothing wrong with dating someone like this in general, but remember to look after yourselves too, fellas.",

We didn't live together but every time we spent together began with the list of what's wrong.\n\nTired at work? Flower died? Dog had a diarrhea because she fed him scraps from lunch? Knee hurts? Daily house chores she ever refused my help with? A bad horoscope for her zodiac? It's raining? It's hot? It's cold? Anything percievable could be on her list. It was really mentally draining and it felt like endless shit tests over and over again.\n\nShe has specific health issues, resulting in bout of headache, partial blindness and dizziness. Six months in our relationship I answered the phone. It was her, barely talking and begging me to come. I back myself immediately and found her on the floor in a puddle of her vomit. Her dog was panicking, kids were panicking so I called an ambulance and took care of the rest (lunch for kids, cleaning up the mess and generaly taking over her household for a while). She got released later that day and all I recieved was a uttered 'Thanks'. Not even a fucking hug.\n\nThe issue is I'm one of those loyal idiots so I endured these shit tests again and again until I wasn't capable to partake them in a original rate of success anymore. Then she decided I'm not good enough for her and dumped at May previous year. She even managed to make me feel guilty for not being good enough for her.

She was constantly making fun of me, insulting me, and physically hurting me and playing it off as \"playing around\" or making excuses about having autism so she \"isn't good at communicating\". I also have autism, and that's bullshit.\n3) I hated her coming over and was coming up with excuses to not be around her and we'd go months without seeing each other, because I didn't want to be around her.\n4) She tried to force sex acts on me that I wasn't comfortable with and if I refused, she guilted me about feeling like she was \"too fat and ugly\" for me and threatening to hurt herself or starve herself to be \"beautiful enough\" for me. I NEVER said anything about her weight or attractiveness and was constantly reassuring her that I found her attractive, which was a lie, but I loved her.\n5) Every space she entered was disgusting. She never cleaned her room, washed her clothes, did her dishes, changed her bedsheets, or showered. I LOVE cuddling but I hated cuddling her, she smelled disgusting and her hair was always matted and so greasy it left residue on my hands. When I tried to gently suggest maybe she takes a shower at least before we hang out, she flipped out on me about how she has depression and can't, and I was being \"ableist and cruel.\" She had been in therapy and on medication for months, and I have diagnosed depression but couldn't afford therapy anymore, or medication. So that's bullshit. She would come to my house and destroy it, she never cleaned up after herself and always convinced me to clean for her when I came over.\n6) She was constantly trying to get me to buy things for her and pay for things for her, and pay her debts. This reached its peak when she asked me to move across the state, get a new job, and pay all of the bills and rent of an apartment and financially support her while she goes to college. I was to pay for that too. When I told her no, she said she was \"questioning my loyalty\" and needed to \"take a break to revaluate our relationship\".\n7) She came out as polyamorous. Which would be fine and something we could talk about, except she did this after getting a girlfriend. That she apparently had been with for months before telling me, and I was *not* allowed to meet her girlfriend for reasons I was never told.\n8) Every time we hung out, everything had to go HER way. She wants to do something? We *have* to, even if it's dangerous or exhausting or boring or a waste of money. If I didn't do it she'd be *pissed* and say \"FINE, we'll do NOTHING then.\" And sit on her phone and refuse to speak to me, look at me, or do anything with me until it was time for her to go home. If I wanted to do something and she didn't want to, we were NOT going to do it. She'd just refuse, not even talk about it. I want to play computer games with her and she doesn't want to? Just \"No.\" I want to take a walk because it's nice outside? No. I want to play a board game or just sit around and talk? No. And if we were doing something, and she decided she was done, she'd just stop. We would be in the middle of conversation, or a game, and she'd just be like \"I'm bored now.\" And get up and walk away, right in the middle of it.\n\nSo yeah. She was really something. I let this go on for 4 years because I'm stupid, and didn't want to be lonely.",

So we met and talked, and she wanted to stay together so much she said she would force herself to be intimate if I would stay.

Just stayed at her new apartment to get high catch up and watch shows on Netflix. We are really good friends.\n\nSo why did we break up? We never did anything I wanted. I have always been the type of person to do whatever anyone else wants to do. I like being around friends so even if I want a burger and we go get pancakes cause that's what they want, I'm fine because I like pancakes and I like the person I'm hanging out with. That being said, I still want to do things from time to time and I want someone to do them with me. I don't need it all the time but every once in a while is nice.\n\nWell, if I wanted this girl to do anything with me, I basically had to force her to do it. And the annoying this is that she normally loved the things I would suggest so much she would do them by herself from that moment on.\n\nA small example would be tv shows. I really enjoyed stranger things when it first came out. Thought it was a good show. About 3 months after that show is when this girl and I got together. She had never watched so I thought suggested we watch it. 3 years we were together and over the course of those three years 2 other seasons had dropped all of which I had to watch alone. She was not interested even though I knew she would love it. But everytime I made the suggestion she would deflect and pay attention to something else. I even had it pulled up on the TV when the third season dropped so we could start at season on and she fell asleep while I went to get snacks. Could not get her to watch it so I gave up. Well, the next year around April, she was in a class in college when a girl who she had met that week suggested stranger things to her and what do you know, she calls me a few days later to say she binged the whole show with out me. I was so annoyed and angry as this was something I suggested for years and she does it off a new person that she didn't talk to after 4 months of being friend meanwhile we had been dating for years and never once did she want to watch it with me.\n\nTruth be told, there were alot more incidents than this but this really was the straw that broke the camels back. I grew distant from her after that. It felt like she didn't trust me despite have a batting average of 100 when it came to things she liked, whether that be social events, movies, shows, video games or food. \n\nI told her about this multiple times previously by the way so I didn't decide to be distant for no reason. It just felt like everytime I tried, I got no result. So we stopped seeing each other. \n\nThat being said she still does the same thing to me. I told her about Arcane on Netflix when it came out last year. The first time she watched an episode with when I hung out at her apartment and she once again admitted she didn't think she would like the show until I made her watch it.\n\nI love her but I could never date her for this reason.",

I was very traditional in terms of culture and ethics, she was more loose for lack of a better word. So slowly over time our admiration for eachother slowly corroded into powderkegs with us smoking within arms length (<— stolen from Otto Von Bismarck). A few days before she dumped me I remember telling my friend “I genuinely thought of breaking up with her, but I didn’t really mean it to myself right?” She was silent. Eventually I came to realize that was my brain just telling me I was done. She blocked me a few weeks after trying to rekindle our friendship. I don’t think it was for any spiteful reason like her disliking me as a person or something, but at that point I could tell both of us felt some kind of uneasy tension in the air, things would never be the same again and we both knew it.

All my family lived abroad, my wife was abroad, I was literally all alone and could barely stand. When they told me it could possibly be cancer, I messaged my wife and told her what they said. I told her that I just needed to be comforted by my wife. She turns around and says that she can't comfort me, only God can. She refused to comfort me or talk to me and told me to go pray because only that would help. They did a CT guided biopsy on my spine and it turned out to be Tuberculosis. Anyway, this was in 2014 and even now she says that I lied about the cancer just to scare her. I still have papers that showed they investigated me for cancer. She claims she acted that way towards me because she was upset that she was pregnant and I was in a different country However, my visa hadn't come through yet so I couldn't be with her for the final 1.5 months of her pregnancy.

            "text": "A couple of relationships pop up: \n\nA girl I lived with when I was 21 and she was 19 was SUPER insecure about our relationship to the point that my actual 21st birthday wasn't with my friends, I went to the grocery store and bought a six pack of some boozy beverage (one of those lemonades I think) and went home where she'd \"made dinner\" for my birthday...(it was a disaster). Every time I wanted to go out to see friends, not even late at night...just anything that didn't include her, she'd have a crisis and I'd feel guilty and not go. What broke the camel's back was I was driving to go visit my mom in another state, about a 6 hour drive, and about 15 minutes after I left she called bawling having another crisis and asked me to come home. I told her my mom hadn't seen her son in over a year, I was going to go and see her but if GF was really that down I'd come back tomorrow. She asked me to come back the same day. I refused and suddenly realized what I'd allowed to happen. I figured we'd talk about it when I got back and if she understood that I wasn't going to go cheating on her the moment I was out of sight we'd be okay. We talked. She decided to try a weekend alone at our favorite vacation spot to see how it felt. I supported this and paid for the hotel. She cheated that weekend. \n\nHad a girlfriend once who was pretty old fashioned and I was okay with that in general, I paid for everything (I was in my career, she had JUST finished college) and we were heading to dinner one day about an hour from my house. The plan was to have dinner together then she and some girlfriends would meet up and I would meet up with a college friend for his birthday separately. We were about 40 min into the drive when I realized I had forgotten my wallet...Bummer, with my wallet was the gift for my buddy. I asked her if we could swing by an ATM and if I could borrow $40 until tomorrow so I could get him a smaller gift and cover a round of drinks. She absolutely refused to stop by the ATM and started crying at the thought of paying for dinner. I knew at that point it wasn't going to work but we gutted it out for a few weeks. (turns out she had, at 23, NEVER been to an ATM before and didn't know how they worked so the actual crying was due to stress at the thought of a new activity.)\n\nOne girlfriend told me I was \"too affectionate\" so I petulantly decided to see how long it would take for her to kiss me without me coming in for a smooch first. one week in and I realized I was being a child. We broke up that night. \n\nOne was incapable of being happy, or even content for more than about a day. There was always SOMETHING going on (I realize now she had some mental health issues which could have been helped with proper care but I was pretty young at the time and had no concept of these matters at the time). School was so tough, stress. Finished school, job was tough, stress. Other friends cooked a meal for their boyfriends but she couldn't cook, stress. Her dog barking too much, stress. Her dog barking less than the day before, stress. Quit the job that was causing stress, stress. The moment I knew it was over was when I FINALLY convinced her to try something new (happens to have been moroccan food) and she liked it! Woo! Then she started stressing that she hadn't been willing to try it before... I couldn't do it anymore at that time. \n\nI'm sure I have more, I'm old lol. I'm married now to someone who is a much better match for me than these...I'm sure they were right for someone, just not for me.",

I would go to my brothers house and have dinner and watch the show with them... she was invited but refused to go and she hated that I went and would pissed about it because she should be my whole life like I was hers and we shouldn't need anyone else...  she hid from my people when they came over\n\nI was already getting turned off by us being called a mistake and her not sleeping with me... this insanity didn't help... I was losing that loving feeling as the song goes...\n\nBut I was trying because even now I don't have much experience with anything long term and thought maybe these were just tribulations I had to deal with since the whole thing started weird...\n\nWell, she was still talking to my buddy who moved away and was asking him for money to help him get a new car... by this time I was mostly done and she comes to ask me to tell my buddy she and I aren't together so he will give her this money... I told her to fuck off with that shit and from then on we were mostly just roommates... \n\nI cared and didn't want her back in an abusive situation but fuck being with this fruit loop\n\nBrother and I had to take a trip to North Dakota one weekend to help out his dad, when we came back, she was gone.\n\nI was indifferent by that time... glad I didn't have to kick the kids out\n\nWhat's funny is a month or so later I was in North Dakota working making like 10k a month and I feel as though she would have tried to stick around had she known\n\nThat buddy and I didn't talk for a while because she said he was talking all kinds of shit about me... when we finally buried the Hatchet... he told me all she had said... she swore up and down we weren't together and that even though she was living with me and I was gone most of the day 7 days a week that she could get away, I had raped her... she was quality...\n\nFantastic cook and a great rack... I miss that bit\n\nMy brother tracked down her husband... said he seemed like a decent guy... he said that she has done this to him several times... says he is abusive and leaves",
