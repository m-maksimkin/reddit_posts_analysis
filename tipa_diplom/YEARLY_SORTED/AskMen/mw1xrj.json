But it’s always a genuine compliment that I feel honored receiving.\n\nYou gotta understand that some fragrances will either work with or will not work with your body chemistry.\nYet, Here’s a nice guideline of alcohol concentration levels with the general timeline.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/HjmfeNp.jpg\n\nMajority of fragrances state either: EDT or EDP\n\nEau de Toilette ~ 2-4 hours of the scent lasting on your skin\n\nEau de Parfum ~ 4-6\n\nGoing back to “body chemistry,” this one is a tricky one to nail down. My tip of this is to: next time you’re in a department store and you can try a scent out. Spray 2 different scents/brands on either wrist (ex: bleu de Chanel left wrist / dior savouge right wrist). Because your blood pumps on your wrist it can activate the scent faster and react to your body chemistry. Smell the initial notes as soon as its made contact with your skin. Let it set on your wrist for an hour or 2, smell again. The second and third notes will react since your wrist have been pumping through, thus heat activating the alcohol, thus allowing the scents to continue their role (making you smell great). Once you’ve tried this method with other scents / brands / scent Families you’ve then found which fragrances go with your body chemistry.\n\n\nThere are different types of scent families you’d might want to get familiar with, this will make sense in order to know what type of scents you prefer.\n\nSpice\n\nWood\n\nCitrus\n\nFresh\n\nFloral (mostly found in woman’s perfume)\n\n\nMost fragrances play around with these scent families. Finding a brand / scent you like and seeing how it reacts to your body chemistry, you’ll then know which scent compliments you. So much so that you should begin to receive the appropriate amount of compliments.\n\n\nExtra Tip: Spray fragrances after your shower.\n\n1 spray on each wrist\n\n1 spray on left/right side on neck\n\n1 spray on left/right back side of knees (yes, the opposite side of your kneecaps) THATS IT\n\n1 spray on your balls (I don’t do this, but some men do lol)\n\nyou don’t want to overwhelm yourself (and others) with the smell but it will be just enough for anyone to take notice. And that’s what we want. For the right people to notice.\nI seemed to have went off the deep end, but I hope anything I shared shed some light or was helpful.",

First, some quick recs, then I'll talk about the huge rabbit hole you can go down.\n\nBasic recommendations:  \nYSL - Y  \nTom Ford - F'ing Fabulous  \nAnything cuir if you're into leather, but oddly enough, Jo Malone - Bronze Wood & Leather always gets a good response  \nZOMG Smells - Zeppelin to the Moon or The Baron (dilute oil in Everclear to desired concentration.)  \nShay & Blue - Blackberry Woods\n\nRabbit Hole Layer 1  \nGo to the fragrance counter and test everything. Start with test strips if they have them. Some fragrances you'll know right away they're not for you. Wear a long sleeved shirt, but roll up your sleeves and test on different areas of your arms. If you're a total nut,  write notes on your arms about which is which. Come back to it later, because your skin chemistry and the base notes in the fragrance need time to meld. Get 1-2 fragrances and enjoy them. Change to unscented deodorants if you use them - nothing ruins an $80 cologne like a conflicting deodorant smell.\n\nRabbit Hole Layer 2  \nSmell everything. Become a connoisseur of top notes, middle notes, and bottom notes. Read up on Fragrantica and other review sites. Use the reviews and the fragrances you have to start picking out different aromas within the fragrance. Notice your ability to cook or enjoy food improve as your sense of smell broadens. Repeat the counter experience. Maybe get some splits from people online, who buy a whole bottle and then decant, for stuff you can't try locally. Learn the lingo.\n\nRabbit Hole Layer 3  \nSeek out attars and Eastern perfumes, which are often undiluted by alcohol and last much longer. These also have a clearer progression from top to middle to base notes. You'll find yourself wearing these for your own enjoyment, rather than for other people. A dab on the chin, under your mask. If you don't live in a city with a large Muslim population, try Etsy. Most vendors on there are glad to send you samples by post. (I recommend Rising Phoenix and Mellifluence Attars.)\n\nRabbit Hole Layer 4  \nMake the leap to straight oudh oils and top shelf artisan EDPs. Spend days sitting around smelling your wrists like a lunatic. At this point you're probably broke, because you dropped over $1000 on a 30ml bottle of that insanely strong musk / ambergris tincture that you can't bring yourself to use regularly.

Old spice seems to be hit or miss and mostly from women in their late 20s - early 30s, it seems like a lot of 90's kids were exposed to this scent and honestly it's not bad just a bit to immature for my tastes.\n\nI personally use Burberry Brit for Men, it's been the least costly, best-smelling with the longest duration out of anything I've tried on my skin, I spray it and it kinda smells like home, my partner commented once that she was cuddling our dog on the couch and she smelled so much like me that she thought I had sprayed her in cologne.\n\nThe other scent I have in the rotation is ARMAF - Club De Nuit Intense, another not so costly scent, it smells very good very similar to the much more costly Aventus - Creed, the description on their marketing page does a decent job of explaining it  \"*Armaf is a classic and strong masculine fragrance that opens with crisp,  fresh and clean citrus notes lemon, bergamot, mandarin orange, lime and  grapefruit*. \"\n\nBoth are under $50 - $60 (Canadian tims caps) and are about half full after daily rotational use.

I liked it because you don't end up with everyone else's sent.  I stopped subscribing once I found 1-2 I liked and you can buy from them. It's usually more expensive brands, but cologne will last years so I think it's worth paying for something you like.",

            "text": "Some things to mention about cologne.\n\n1. Cologne smells different on different people because it mixes with the natural oils on your skin and gives a slightly varied scent. \n\n2. Eau de parfum has higher oil concentration than eau de toilette, and so they last longer. This is desirable when you like the heart notes or base notes of the cologne. However, they're generally a skin scent after 3-4 hours.\n\n3. The oils are heat activated so wrist and neck are ideal locations. The whole spray a mist and walk through it is stupid and I've heard it way too often from men as old as their 40's\n\nWith that said, my most complimented cologne is Bleu de Chanel, a fresh scent that gets compliments from both men and women.\n\nMy second one is Aventus from house of Creed, a fair bit pricier but still gets compliments from both men and women. It's a bit sweet and citrus-y at first (pineapples) and then settles into a more green and woodsy/earthy scent. The latter half is a bit more polarizing, but it definitely stands out.",

And I get complimented on my scent by cashiers and even other men, when I go out, plus women of course\n  \nSome examples of women's perfumes I use are:  Alien by Mugler, which I really love. That's a gorgeous smelling perfume, smells like nothing else, it's very unique. And I also love Weekend by Burberry. It smells absolutely stunning, I really really love that one. An ex of mine always wore Burberry weekend, that's where I learned of it. \n  \nI usually combine women's perfume with mens perfume. For those who don't know, perfume is simply a stronger version of cologne. Perfume isn't \"the women's version of cologne\". Most men's colognes have a perfume version too. Toilette is the weakest version, the smell lasts the shortest amount of time. Then there's cologne which is a bit stronger and lasts longer. Then there's perfume, which is the most expensive, but it's the strongest smelling and longest lasting, so you don't need to use as much so it's really more frugal\n  \nThere's perfume versions of mens cologne. All it is is the same scent, it just smells stronger and lasts longer. I always wear a big of Acqua Di Gio, cos everyone loves that, it's just a nice standard sweet smelling scent. I buy the perfume version of that. It's still mens perfume.\n   \nSo I combine women's and men's perfumes usually. Some Weekend by Burberry or Alien by Mugler mixed with Acqua Di Gio perfume just to sort of ground it and not smell so much out of this world, if that makes sense.

My father and I love Royal Mayfair which is more of a gourmand fragrance. This might be sacrilegious,  but neither of us care for Aventus or Aventus cologne. It’s pretty good, but not wowing like some of the others. Terre d’hermes is a good staple but I’d recommend getting the EDT over EDP. The EDP is overwhelming at times.  I agree with other commenters that Versace Eros, while good, is much more of a club fragrance. Bleu de Chanel to me is much more of a personal fragrance and smells amazing yet has a more mild sillage (which I prefer). If you’re into more leathery fragrances I’d recommend taking a look at Memo Paris as sometimes they have sample sets on the online luxury stores like Saks/Nordstrom/Neiman Marcus. I highly recommend if you like blue/summer fragrances looking at getting the Atelier  discovery set at their website which is a very good price for the #of samples. At the end of the day you should get/wear fragrances that make you feel good. While getting complements is nice, being able to enjoy the fragrance for yourself is what I think is more rewarding.",

I've gotten nothing but compliments. \n\nAs a bonus, solid colognes erase the worry about broken or leaky bottles while traveling. I have one oil-based cologne for special occasions and the rest are solid and honestly, I'm never going back to regular cologne.\n\nThe trick, like somebody else said, is to test it on yourself if possible and wait for several minutes before giving it a sniff. Your body chemistry and even the scent of the soap you use will change how the cologne smells. Try to match notes with all your grooming products (ie, I use cypress&juniper cologne, my shampoo has notes of fir in it, my soap is Pacific cedar, my deodorant also has juniper - all woody scents) and you'll stand out as that guy who always smells amazing.",

            "text": "I’ve been big into men’s fragrance since I was a teenager! These are my everyday favorites:\n\nDolce and Gabbana Light Blue: casual and breezy, sparkling fruity-floral scent that evokes the spirit of the Sicilian summer. Mouth-watering and fresh notes of lime and cedar are bringing an image of the South woods on the seashore. A very popular summer fragrance. \n\nVersace Eros: fresh mint leaves, Italian lemon zest, and green apple. ( in my experience it’s either hit or miss but those that enjoy it, LOVE it)\n\nGerad Monet’s La Pluie:  as an unexpected encounter between the fresh grapefruit notes, the delicate jasmine, and the alluring patchouli.\n\nJimmy Choo Man: seductive lavender and fresh honeydew melon blend with pink pepper and pineapple leaf, while an elegant trail of patchouli leaves a lasting imprint\n\nDipityque Vetyverio: My go to sexy time cologne, it’s described as: Like inlaid wood, vetiver reveals unexpected facets: sometimes fresh, other times smoky or subtly floral. There are a kaleidoscope of olfactory nuances in this single raw material, magnified here in an unusual interpretation. This one is very unisex, simply smells amazing.\n\nHonorable mention\nAqua Di Gio: Mediterranean sun. Bitter citrus with aromatic nuance of rosemary intertwines with salty, sea nuances and pellucid hedione. Sharp notes of spices are softened by woody base with warm, musky trail.\nWhile I don’t own this one anymore it smells so good I can identify it immediately if somebody passes me wearing it. Clearly leaves an impression.\n\n*these are in no general order and I got the descriptions from their websites",

For a cologne it is closer to the fresh/clean side of the spectrum than the spice/musk side, but it still has that interesting, expensive(?), complex blend of both that I tend to notice in high-end cologne. Not to mention, I’ve gotten it on sale for $13 before! \n\na high-end recommendation: I recently bought my boyfriend [Montblanc Legend](https://www.montblanc.com/en-us/eau-de-parfum_cod560971903980515.html) which is currently sold out online, but likely available at your local department store. It’s oil based, so a little goes a long way and stays on all day even through sweat, unlike alcohol-based perfumes/colognes that would start to fade. It’s a really complex, but balanced mixture of freshness and musk.

It doesn't really matter if the shop person thinks it's great or if someone recommends it here - if you don't like it, it'll be a waste of money.\n2. Buy only a size that you'll realistically use before it goes off. Once they are tool old the smell degrades. It can be tempting to buy the larger bottle which is usually far cheaper per ml but if you won't use it before it goes off, it's just a waste of money.\n3. Pick something age appropriate. I don't mean anything weird by that but just that your tastes will likely change as you age. Some scents can be great when you're younger but you'll probably want to move to something else as you get older. You'll change and so will what suits you.\n4. Don't coat yourself in the stuff. Just enough to have a pleasant smell when someone is near you. Like \"mmm that smells good, I want to be near you\" not \"that is so strong I'm going to stand 2 metres away and can still barely breathe\".\n\nHope that's helpful. Remember these are just my opinions so feel free to ignore me!",

The really cool thing imo, is variations of the batches can smell more vanilla, pineapple, smokey, etc. Works as part of my first impression ensemble for special occasions",

After owning \\~30 or so different colognes here is my list:\n\n\nEveryday wear (these will generally be fresh and inoffensive):\n\n\nBleu de Chanel - either the EDP or Parfum, citrusy on the top end and woody on the drydown\n\n\nAcqua Di Gio Profumo - huge complement getter, aquatic smelling with an incense note that smells very masculine\n\n\nClubbing (huge projection that is great for night life):\n\n\nVersace Ero - mint and apple opening that is incredibly strong, apply sparingly\n\n\nSummer (fresh scents that hold up in high temperatures):\n\n\nDolce and Gabbana light blue intense - basically the most aquatic scent out there, smells like you're at the beach\n\n\nDior Sauvage EDT - a more synthetic blend of citrus and spices, is a performance beast due to the ambroxan\n\n\nWinter (warmer scents aimed at being more intimate):\n\n\nDolce and Gabbana The One EDP - skip the EDT as it lasts only a couple hours, this is a very warm, woody and spicy fragrance\n\n\nBvlgari Man in Black - smells like Christmas day in a bottle, very woody and sophisticated\n\n\nCheaper options (for those not looking to break the bank):\n\n\nAzzaro Chrome - all around quality freshie\n\n\nMercedes Benz Club Black - great budget vanilla scent\n\n\nHigher end (for those with cash to burn):\n\n\nCreed Aventus - the hype king, a green fragrance with a citrus opening, note that this gets more compliments from guys than anyone else\n\n\nParfums de Marly Layton - spicy vanilla scent, women seem to love absolutely love this one\n\nAll of the above have netted me a significant amount of compliments, just make sure to wear something that fits the setting you will be in!\n\n\nImportant Edit: Try not to use conflicting deodorant or soap, so as to not conflict with your cologne. Arm and Hammer Ultra Max scentless deodorant is great for this purpose!",

I don't think I'm the most handsome guy in the world, but smelling good and dressing like I'm not a hobo has more than made up for it. \n\nAs such, I've collected a LOT of colognes. The ones I've gotten the most compliments on are:\n\n1) Acqua di Gio by Armani - there's a reason this has been so recommended so often in such a blanket way. It smells GREAT by itself and it smells great on practically anyone that wears it. Works universally, day and night, all through the year, tho I feel it's far better spring/summer scent. First time I ever wore this, I was complimented by a stranger. I've owned a bottle since.\n\n2) Chrome by Azzaro - smells great and lasts a really long time. Not a lot of people's favourites, but one of mine. Reminds me of water the ocean! I think it's a perfect summer scent, light and great all through the day. I wore this once to a place I worked and girls I worked with kept complimenting me over it and I started wearing it way, way more often! \n\n3) London by English Laundry - this is a surprisingly mature and masculine scent by a label that's really new and has kicked ass and taken names. It's sweet, but spicy, and I think it's a killer \"date\" cologne for a night on the town. I'd wear this one more summer/fall.\n\n4) Eros by Versace - another evening cologne in my opinion, great sweet smells. I think this is the scent a lot of women would enjoy over many colognes out there, going so far as to be the pick they would choose to gift their man if they didn't own any colognes! And honestly, I wouldn't blame them. If you're young, still going to clubs? Wear this. Thank me later. I think this one works year round.",

Mandorlo di Sicilia by Acqua Di Parma. Sweet and smooth without being cloying and the hands down favorite amongst my female friends, more than one has referred to it as a \"pantry dropper\".

This scent is marketed as unisex and preferred by women because of the fragrance profile, but *don't let that stop you* from buying a $3 sample vial and giving it a shot this summer.

Usually about $180 for 3.4oz. But one spray will literally last on your clothing for weeks, if not months. It also has incredible \\*sillage\\* (I think that's the word if I remember correctly) What that means is it really trails you for a long time.  In fact the way I found out about Le Labo was in the early 2010's... I was at a bar and I literally followed someone in a path around the bar just by smelling the scent. Santal 33, if you like a good sandalwood, will likely be my main go to for a long time to come. It has, so far, been my go to since like 2013. All of their scents are great, most are unisex.

This one you can still buy. It changes subtly throughout the day, starting off as a fresh scent, and winds up smelling almost chocolate-y by mid-afternoon? Can't really explain it, science I guess. \n\nOne thing the fiance recommends is getting one of those fragrance samplers that give you ~10 or so products to try, and then a way for you to order a full sized version of your favorite one.\n\nIn additon, what works on one person may not work on you, depending on your skin chemistry.\n\nLastly, I would also recommend maybe going to a place like Sephora that has a ton of selection grouped by 'scent themes' AND a really good return policy in case what you buy doesn't work for you! Also, the people that work there are really knowledgable about their products, and will not hesitate to tell you what scent they love on a man! \n\nHope your scent hunt goes well! :)",

Always got compliments on it whenever I'd wear it. It is pretty classy and I highly recommend. It's a fairly strong scent\n\n\nI dont really wear cologne anymore. I out grew it. I use pomades, deodorants, and soaps for my scent.\n\nI started noticing that cologne just smells like cologne. Like yeah. Each smells different. But it all smells like *cologne*. So I decided to switch it up. I think the pomades, deodorants, and soaps are classier, subtle, and unique. \n\nThink of the difference between *I smell good* and *my cologne smells good*.",

Pretty much everyone has a father or grandfather or other paternal figure who wore it, so it taps into those feelings and just smells manly. I buy into the \"if your grandfather didn't wear it, you wouldn't be here\" tagline. \n\nIn the summer I tend to go for a bay rum.

For the record, I am happily married to a human woman. I did go through a very metrosexual phase just after college. For whatever reason, I wasted many, many dollars on my way to becoming a cologne connoisseur during this time. \n\nI put my colognes into categories. Ones that I would wear with suits. Ones that I would wear with business casual. Ones that I would wear with jeans and shirts. Those three categories were broken into color categories. Ones that I wore with blacks and greys. Ones that I wore with blues and browns. Ones that I wore with whites. I never mixed and matched any of categories. I have OCD and this kind of nonsense has been applied to many things throughout my life. It all makes perfectly good sense to me and I'm not ashamed to tell people I appreciate structure and organization!  \n\nThere are 4 colognes that I highly suggest. 3 are lesser and know and most are probably familiar with the 4th.  In no particular order,  \n\n1. Varvatos by John Varvatos, brown bottle wrapped in a plain black leather band. Important because there is another JV cologne, Vintage, that comes in a bottle that looks similar. The only difference is, Vintage has a textured leather band wrapped around it. Don't get the Vintage.  \n\n2. Versace Blue Jeans. One of the cleanest, best smelling colognes I have ever owned. Be careful. You will find it hard not to want to have sex with your boyfriend every time he has it on.  \n\n3. Chrome by Azzaro. My second favorite. This is a blue suit kind of cologne but, for those who aren't OCD, it would work just fine with jeans and a t-shirt too.  \n\n4. Aqua di Gio, a classic. It's sharp. More upscale than others. Can't go wrong with it.  So, hope this helps. Good luck.",

Not only that, but the smell will announce your approach long before you appear. One of the greatest fragrances I've ever owned and smelled.\n\n\nMaison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait de Parfum\n\nTop notes - Bitter Almond and Saffron\n\nMiddle notes - Egyptian Jasmine and Cedar\n\nBase notes - Ambergris, Musk, and \"Woody Notes\"\n\nMy consensus: This is basically the big brother to the previously-mentioned fragrance. It's heavier, sweeter, and lasts MUCH longer. Similar in smell, but with just a few tweaks that make it unique in its own right. It's a nice alternative to the aforementioned variant.\n\n\nMaison Francis Kurkdjian Oud Satín Mood Extrait de Parfum\n\nTop notes - Violet Accord, Geranium, Cinnamon from Ceylon\n\nMiddle notes - Damascena Rose Essence from Turkey and Centifolia Rose Absolute from Tunisia\n\nBase notes - Natural Oud from Laos, Vanilla, and Amber Accord\n\nMy consensus: This is not for one who wants to be subtle and unnoticed. This is incredibly loud, overpowers every cubic inch of the room you're in, and will linger hours after you've left. Some people absolutely love this specific scent, it's incredibly warm and spicy, and also extremely recognizable if you've smelled it even once before. Either you love it or you hate it. Loud and proud, baby.\n\n\nBy the way, all of these are unisex and obviously, depending on your body, may smell good, bad, or ugly.",

I'd say the sexiest extra scent aside from being clean would be storing your stuff in cedar. You can get cedar wardrobes, closet inserts, or just rings/ balls/ shavings to place in your dresser or closet. It's great for repelling moths but also creates such a warm, sexy, woodsy scent that lingers on fabrics. If you are dead set on cologne I'd suggest something of the soft/ woodsy family: sandalwood, amber and spraying it sparingly or even just a squirt on the collar/ cuff of your intended outfit the morning of (if you intend to go out in the evening). Honestly storing your clothes in some sort of cedar will be like a perma-cologne. It will save you money and, especially if you splurge on a cedar wardrobe or dresser, you will likely get a well made piece of furniture that will last a lifetime.",

Different group will favor different type of fragrance so \"smell good\" is a bit hard.\n- to make things harder the smell evolve in time. The head notes are the fragrance most powerful and most volatile note but last Like 20min. The deeper notes will last all day but you are unlikely to smell it because you get use to it. To test it, use the paper strips at the shop and don't throw them right away. Keep them and try 10min later\n- your skin can affect the smell of the fragrance A LOT. Doctors recommend to spray it on your clothes anyway.\n- some fragrance will smell good in winter but not in summer. Try to think about it.\n- some brands are better than others...

They can talk you through lots of different things that are unique to you, helping find your signature scent. I'm a lady and I'm Black Opium, none of that fake stuff, gotta be the real deal for me.

I will say though it has a very specific floral/clean sent its not like Versace Eros where you can instantly tell its cologne and not someone who just showered. That's why I like these they don't smell like cologne usually does unless someone's pressing their nose into your chest but even then the scent is very chill and clean.
