Go to the gym, learn Karate, take college classes, or go to the base auto shop and learned about cars.  Just don’t sit in the barracks drinking all the time.”  \nHe was absolutely right because I saw a lot of people become alcoholics.\n\n2)College orientation.

In many cases, they move away from the practise of their job, into management, where you may earn more, but work longer and have to deal with (managing) more people, often on more fixed hours, which is more stressful.

If you don't agree or don't have something good to say let her know you hear her and appreciate her bringing this up and take some time to process it and get back to her.\n\nShut down that initial reaction to be defensive or to minimize her feelings or prove her wrong.  This is almost never a good response.  \n\nSlightly unconventional in that it came from myself to myself.  I was grappling with marriage struggles and trying to process the cycle my wife and I get into and how to escape it.  I was in the shower and was re-playing stuff she told me and trying to figure out how to best respond to her bringing emotions to me that didn't make sense to me.  After realizing that her emotions usually end up making plenty of sense after I navigate them I instantly realized what I had to do.\n\nWhen I say shut the fuck up I mean it's okay to ask questions to clarify, but they have to be from a place of actual clarification.

(At the time it was $14 an hour.)\n\nI was 19. I thought I was the richest fucking guy in the world. But I wasn’t happy, I was miserable at that job. Terrible management, constantly getting fucked over, poor scheduling. At one point I worked 13 days in a row with 1 off day, then had to work another 8 in a row. No we weren’t understaffed. Coworkers didn’t have anyones back, we were just in it for the money, and constantly having that fear of someone in the team stealing tips. No trust at all. After I finally quit, it was like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I got the money I saved up from tips and just used it daily and never looked back.\n\nMy current job only pays minimum wage, here in CA it’s $15 an hour. And it’s full time. But it’s easier, better and my mental health has never been in a better place. It’s hard to see, but I promise you, quality of life is not worth the extra money",

Focus on something that pays the bills, diversify your skills through that, and along the way you’ll find something that you dont mind doing and pays the bills”. I know a lot of people might be critical of this because of burnout and what not but he was 100% right. I started construction at 16 when someone would take me, now Im a homeowner at 22 living comfortably in a place I love. I have too many friends that are bouncing around dead end jobs or drowning in college debt for a degree that might not even make them any money.

He would have killed me if I had stayed. He had a lot of money, for example he got a check from his grandpa for a million dollars on his 21st birthday. He said I only married him for money. Actually I really loved him. But while I was in the hospital he thought it was cool to shack up with our nanny. We were living abroad at the time and as soon as we could fly and arrange tickets, I packed up my 2 children and 2 suitcases and left. No one had ever left him before.  And now 21 years later he still is mad.  Over Christmas before handing the phone over to my son, he said who leaves the country on vacation and never comes back. Well,  someone leaving an abuser. \nSo, yeah. Divorce was a good thing and I met the love of my life. ❤",

Was he mad that I joined the Navy instead of the Army like he did? It really sucked during boot camp. Then after graduation I came back home for 2 weeks. My dad took me out to dinner. We didn’t have the father-son relationship you see on tv. We rarely spoke about feelings and stuff like that. But as I stared at him eating, I felt angry that he wasn’t saying anything. So I flat out asked “why did you tell me to not come back?” He looked at me and said: \n\n“mijo, both your mothers and fathers side of the family all live here. We all do the same thing: work at some shitty job Monday-Friday, get shitface drunk Friday and Saturday nights, then go to church on Sunday, say a couple of Hail Mary’s, and act like everything is ok. Week in, week out. Same thing. We find someone to marry, have kids, then when the kids grow up, they do that same thing every week. I never wanted that life for you. You’re better than that, better than us.”\n\nI got out of the military after my 4 year tour, and didn’t go home. I found a job and have been (IMO) successful for the last 25 years. I still go home to visit, and my dad and I talk about everything now. Sorry this is so long.",

Imagine what it feels like for a child who can't take any pain meds. I promise you that if you think you can't afford it then you really won't be able to afford it when the situation gets worse. I have never felt more like a failure as a mother as when that moment my kid was in dental pain. $10,000 later... \nNever again. I never tell anyone how to parent or offer advice but this. This I will tell parents non stop about taking their kids as soon as their child gets their first nub. TAKE YOU KIDS to the DENTIST.\nWe never gave my child candy...

            "text": "After working for a little over  year out of school in manufacturing, I scheduled a weeks vacation with friends to snowboard in Snowmass CO.  I was working long hours (sometimes 60-70 hour weeks) and was a certainly a bit burnt out of work.  \n\n Fast forward to Colorado, after 4-5 days of boarding, partying, meeting lots of locals, hooking up with my one friend who dropped out of college to go be a ski bum, I was seriously asking myself why I didn't join the crowd, do something I absolutely loved.  6th day I was making  plans, figuring out when I was going to quit my job, where I would move to, what job I would do to get lift tix, etc.   I had thoroughly made the decision to move to Colorado (from Chicago).\n\nLast day .... I got split up from my friends on a lift.  I took the chair up by myself, and a single rider, a guy wearing old skis, taped jacket and bibs, long scraggly beard, hopped on with me.  We started talking, and he was asking me about where I lived, what I did.  Asked me about my jobs benefits, health insurance, 401k, etc.  After 5-10 mins of questioning me, he turns to me and says \" man, I wish I went to school and got a good job like you did.  I'm 52, still working as a carpenter, my knees are shit, my back in constant pain, I can only ski an hour or two a week max because of my knees and back.  I have no healthcare insurance, no retirement savings, don't know how or when I'll be able to retire.  I really wish I was in your position, working for a great company, making good money, saving for retirement, and can afford to come out here whenever you want to vacation\"\n\nMan. What a stinger, and reversal.  Hit me hard, and realized that short term fun always seems like the right choice, but I'm glad he made me rethink, and to this day, I take 2-3 trips a year snowboarding, enjoy every run and every day I do ... And (still) have a great job and I'm well on my way to retirement.  I wish I knew who that guy was to  thank him for opening eyes to the reality of making thought through decisions and thinking for the long term.\n\n Peace out, kind stranger, I hope life was/is good for you and I'm glad we shared a chair that day, certainly changed perspective and course of life.",

I was working all the time to support my wife and son and these words absolutely cut through everything I was dealing with and broke me. I've since learned to take it slow and stay focused on what matters (keeping my eyes fixed on the horizon). I spend more time with my kids to make sure I don't miss out on their lives. I make it a point to try new things whenever possible, even if they're scary (as long as they're safe).

Not join them in THEIR chaos.\n\nThat second one helps us a lot. ADHD and Autism can look a lot like bad behaviour when a child is overwhelmed, getting cross never helps. It only escalates matters. You have to be the adult, you \nhave to handle it better and model better emotional control. That doesn't mean letting things go without consequences. But I know first hand that you cannot hear or think straight when your head is in a storm. Bring them to calm, then you can discuss any consequences etc.\n\nIt's not permissive parenting to help a child regulate their emotions before you talk to them about behaviour. We do natural actions and consequences... But seriously a child in a meltdown cannot hear reason, bring them back down and then you can tackle consequences (you mess it up, you tidy it/ You break it, you pay to replace it etc etc). \n\nTbh. I think the whole world could benefit by learning to not try and discuss something or have words when the other person is distressed in some way. Focus on keeping your own calm, there is time to discuss everything when people have calmed down. Respect their space to feel what they feel in the moment, don't bloody make it worse by adding your lack of control into the mix too. That goes for anyone.",

But what he really meant was, “it’s okay to FEEL like you hate your kids.” The feeling is totally normal, the actions from it are of course absolutely not okay.  \n\nI laughed when he first said it, but after my son was about 6 months old…it clicked. That feeling hits you, hard, and often sometimes. These little beast can totally drain your entire life essence, daily, so of course you’ll get that flash of resentment…but you can’t hate yourself for it.
