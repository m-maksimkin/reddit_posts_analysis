Because we were teenagers, we were up basically all night hanging out. Sometime around 1am, I realize I need to piss really fucking bad, so I get up to go, and my buddy is like \"be quiet while you're in there, don't wake up my dad\".\n\nSo I go in there, and I'm lasering the porcelain. Virtually no sound. But I'm continuing to piss. Keep pissing. Can't stop pissing. Suddenly I hear the very familiar sound of piss hitting water from two feet up. Oh my god, I've pissed so much that I've run out of porcelain to hit. I still have a LOT of bladder to empty, so I have no choice but to hit the water. Finally I finish, flush, try to sneak out of the bathroom quietly (like it matters at this point), and I get back to my buddy's room. He just looks at me and is flat out like \"I SAID BE QUIET, WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!\". I had to explain my situation to him and he's laughing his ass off. Years later be told his dad this story, and his dad laughed his ass off too.\n\nI just realized this is my second story on Reddit about pissing. Wtf is wrong with me.",
