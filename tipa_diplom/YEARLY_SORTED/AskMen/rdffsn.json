I understand that you can make money by selling your time and that there are industry standards that you can base your rate from but saving, keeping track of how much is spent, investing... All foreign concepts to me. The worst part of this is that if there is something I want to buy I have to cut off the expense right after all my bills are paid and isolate that money in such a way that I cannot access it. I on any given month will claim to have about 200 bucks to my name for food, pints, dinner out and that has to last me 30 days, if I don't do this and live with such a small monthly allowance I will spend the money on dump shit... Like shitty collectables or drugs just cuz I can. I feel that if I understood financial security and planning for my future better I wouldn't spend so recklessly. Currently I am involved with many pension plans and company investment opportunities which are deducted directly from my pay, I cannot touch this money easily and I never see it in my account. This is the only thing that works for me... But if shit hits the fan I cannot access that money, it's more buying a house money.",

Heck, I can pronounce the Czech letter ≈ô no problem, and I don't even speak Czech. However, I can't pronounce my h's correctly, and I can pretty confidently say a fifth of y'all can't either, at least if you're a native English speaker. The thing is is that it's so subtle you'll never notice it unless you know to listen for it.\n\nTry saying works like hard harsh, or house. If the h sounds, well, harsh and comes from the back of your mouth instead of your throat, then you do the same thing I do and use what's called a uvular fricative instead of a glottal fricative, the latter is which is technically correct.",

I can't do any sports, especially anything to do with catching) \n\nFind a large, open area that's got a solid surface, like a car park / parking lot. Wear knee and elbow pads and a helmet.\n\nSit on the bike and walk it around to get a feel for it. Squeeze the brakes to get an idea of how much pressure they need to stop the bike. Slowly build up a bit of speed, and take your feet off the floor. Let the bike drift to a stop and put your feet down to stop. It might sound a bit silly, but imagine the way you see little kids playing on bikes. You don't want to go too fast yet, you're just practicing balancing. Take as long as you need.\n\nOnce you're comfortable with balancing, start gently using the brakes to slow down and stop. Give yourself plenty of space to get used to them while you're on the bike. They'll need a bit more pressure than when you're walking the bike.\n\nWhen you're comfortable with coasting and braking, try pedalling. Start slowly again, and get used to the bike before you try going faster.\n\nRemember, it's not a competition. Go at your own pace and take whatever time you need.\n\nGood luck :)",

I was trying to teach myself, going around by holding onto the ledge/wall. I thought I was getting the hang of it and braved the smooth area in front of the DJ booth. A groups of girls requesting a song all took off at the same time and knocked some of us beginners down like bowling pins. I ended up at the bottom of a pile. I got an ice pack, kept it moving like nothing had happened. After hours of throbbing pain at home, parents took me to the ER; hairline fracture, 3 months in a cast. I broke my writing hand so I got out of a lot of homework the rest of the year. \n\nAbout 15 years later, I tried to ice skate. I'm an adult now. I can let go of my childhood fear and enjoy a fun winter activity. I was trying to conquer that fear of losing control of the skates in motion (this alleged \"feeling it\" others speak of when trying to teach me) going round and round the rink, never more than a foot away from the safety of the edge/wall. I was getting the hang of it, going fairly fast, when I ran into a wooden gate where the Zamboni was kept. My skate got stuck in the ice under the wood door. I struggled for a while until friends realized it was me stuck in the wall. I was panicking after the crowd around me grew, watching as 2 of my friends were helping me get unstuck. It lasted maybe 5 mins tops but it felt like an eternity of judging eyes upon my crimson cheeks, trying not to cry in front of them all. I sat out the rest of our session. \n\nI'm late 30's now and I just won't submit myself to that humiliation again. Just \"bend my knees\" my ass!!!",

Each in one day or less. \n\n1.\tSit on the bike and walk the bike around until you are comfortable\n2.\tGradually move to coasting a little bit at a time. Feet up (not on the pedals) even for a second. Get comfortable doing that. Then move to longer times until you can comfortably coast for 5-10 seconds at a time. \n3.\tMove to coasting with your feet on the pedals. No pedalling. Just resting your feet. \n4.\tWhen comfortable doing this it will be dead easy to do a couple pedals. Once you get to that point you are laughing and will be surprised how quick you progress to full on riding a bike. You got this.",

            "text": "I can give you pointers. I learnt riding cycle very late too. What is cycle riding?\nIt is the constant effort to stop it from falling. \n\nA cycle when left straight without motion naturally falls either right or left. \n\nForward motion reduces it's tendency to fall but it can still fall. \n\nTry this experiment.\nKeep a cycle still. Allow it to fall left. Then immediately turn the handle left before it falls. You will notice the cycle doesn't fall anymore. \nTry the other way. \n\nSo turning the handle towards the fall direction is the secret. It is the key to stop it from falling. \n\nSee my answer in the top again. Cycle riding is the continuos effort to stop it from falling. Now when someone is riding a cycle. The cycle will want to fall. Either left or right. It does it continuously. The moment the rider feels the cycle falling to the left. He turns the handle to the left. Slightly then straightens it immediately. If he feels the cycle is falling to the right. He slightly turns to the right then straightens it. This doesn't happen once or twice. This happens thousand times throughout the ride. It happens continuously to everyone in the world who is riding right now. They are riding the cycle correctly because they are continually dealing with the fall by turning the handle continuously left or right slightly. We need to build this sensing mechanism in our brain as we practice the cycle. This is called balancing. Once this sense is formed then cycle balancing becomes so natural that you don't even realise that you are balancing your cycle, your hands automatically turn when the cycle Tends to fall. It doesn't happen once or twice. It happens continuously. Your hands will continually balance the cycle. Now coming to pedalling. \nThe cycle cannot move forward without pedalling. \nBut when you press down one pedal. It immediately tilts the cycle to one side and forces it to fall. That's the nature of the pedal. So what to do. Turn the cycle slightly towards the direction of the fall. Then you pedal the other leg. The cycle will fall there. Turn the handle towards that side. So you keep turning slightly to and fro as you pedal left and right. That's the nature of cycling. You are continuously preventing it from falling. That's how cycle works.",

I understand the concept, but the one time I tried did not work out well. I've been told it's easier on newer vehicles. And a lot of new vehicles are coming with this automatic manual transmission where you push past Drive to M and you can change gears without the clutch. Just seems weird to do it manually when the vehicle will do it automatically at the right times.\n\nFor what it's worth, I can ride a bike, but if it has multiple gears, I never quite got the hang of which gears to use. That always annoyed me, I felt the bike was hindering me more than helping me. Like on a mountain bike, or a \"ten speed.\" But, the qualification for \"riding a bike\" isn't operating the gears, or even stopping it. The qualification is generally accepted as balancing on one for a period of time (or measure of distance). And really, once you get the balance, you're good to go.",

Nothing on how to actually poor a cup of coffee and make it taste good.\n\nFor example‚Ä¶ if i go to any gas station and walk up to the machines ‚Ä¶ id have no clue where to start‚Ä¶ theres like 9 handles.

I then realize that I didn't have a place to put my water bottle on my bike like the other people did. I put my bottle in my hoodie but it kept falling out; my bike pants kept falling down; I kept falling off the bike; the front wheel was going all over the place and I couldn't keep myself on the bike path. I almost fell into the canal that was next to the path. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò≠ And the group left me in the dust. 10 minutes after we started, I could no longer see them! They were THAT far ahead. The other facilitator stayed with me because she saw how bad I was struggling. I felt so guilty for ruining her day. Plus I was exhausted and achy and I was never going to catch up with my friends. So I rode back to the beginning, got in my car, and drove home wheezing all the way because now I needed my inhaler that was at home.\n\n(But NOT before stopping to get some pancakes at my favorite restaurant! #Priorities ü§£) \n\nIt was an embarrassing disaster!\n\nThat saying is not true about how you never forget how to ride a bike. ü§≠",
