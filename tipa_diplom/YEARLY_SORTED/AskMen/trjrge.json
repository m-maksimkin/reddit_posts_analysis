            "text": "Ok, funny story about why I do use it now.  I was a college student, and I found out that my school accepted what's called prior learning credits. \n\n What this means is that you can be granted credits in a subject by proving that you have a certain level of equivalency in said subject.  For me, it was a French.  So I went to the prior learning coordinator and asked what the process was.  \n\nBasically, you went in on a Saturday and took a test which measured your ability in whatever subject you were applying for the credits in.  It was a few hundred dollars to take the test, so I figured it was worth a shot (a 3-credit class at my school cost a few grand, so I figured even if I only earned one or two credits, it was time and money well-spent.  My \nwife (then girlfriend) suggested that I do some brushing up prior to the test.  \n\nNow, I will do my best to keep things anonymous, because who the fuck knows how many people this has happened to, and I don't want it to link back to me this way.\n\nAnyway, she knew someone, a friend of her mothers, who was actually a french professor at the school we went to.  We decided that it would make the most sense to do a few tutoring sessions with him.  We were up-front and honest about why we were doing it, and he was mildly impressed with the idea, so he was happy to help out (I'm sure he didn't mind that he'd get paid for his time, but whatever).\n\nSo, I went twice to his apartment, and spent two hours going over fundamentals, translations, etc.  Anyone who's studied a language knows that there are things that you \nremember, but probably couldn't pass a test on.  \n\nI went for our third and final meeting, and took a practice test.  We went over it when I was done, and basically finished our time together.  I thanked him, shook his hand, paid \nhim, and asked if I could use the bathroom before I left.  He, of course said yes.  Possibly his worst mistake ever.\n\nSo, I am standing over the toilet, seat up letting a nice piss loose.  I had always done that hook-thumb, pull-underwear-down method - I thought the fly was a pain in the ass to use, and provided no discernible benefit to me or my penis.\n\nI'm full-stream, when disaster struck.  The toilet seat starts to fall - I guess it was precariously balanced or something.  I panicked.  \n\nThe correct move, in hindsight, would have been to kick up a foot like a ninja, support the lid, finish up, and be done with it.  But, like I said, I panicked.  I reached for the \n\nseat with the hand that had been hooked into my boxers, my waistband flew up, and I couldn't stop my stream.  I pissed on the seat, the lid, the sink, the counter, the floor.  I pissed on his tissues, the toilet paper, the shower curtain.  I pissed *everywhere* but in the toilet.  Or on myself.  \n\nHoly Fuck, I'm thinking.  What.  The.  Fuck.  Can I do with this?  I'm standing there, holding the seat, with piss **everywhere**.  \n\nMy mind kicks into recovery mode.  I have to figure out how to clean this up without flushing twice.  For some reason, I was worried about him thinking I'd taken a shit in there, and figured that two flushes could only be interpreted one way.  I also had to use my time wisely, as that long in a bathroom could also only mean one thing\n\nSo, I start using as little TP as possible to wipe everything up.  I did the best job that I could, but am sure that there was piss hiding \nsomewhere - under a countertop ledge, in a fold of a towel - I mean, it's just not possible that I got every last drop cleaned up.\n\nI walked out, thanked him for everything, and left.  He thanked me, and told me to call him to let him know how I'd done on the test.  Told me to say hi to my girlfriend's mother, etc.\n\nI did pretty well on the test and earned 4 credits toward my degree.  I called him up to thank him and tell him how I'd done.  He seemed a bit annoyed with me, and I was pretty \nsure I knew why.  An annoyed Frenchman sounds quite different from an unannoyed Frenchman.  I think I learned the tone of a \"You-pissed-all-over-my-fucking-bathroom-and-I-only-got-paid-$75-an-hour-for-it-so-fuck-you\" Frenchman.\n\nAbout three weeks later, I couldn't keep my secret.  I was lying in bed with my girlfriend, and I came clean.  She couldn't stop laughing.  She told her parents, my parents, it was her new favorite story.  From that day forward, it was referred to as the Monsiuer PeePee story.\n\nAnd that, my dear Redditors, is why I ALWAYS use the fly in my underwear.",

I didn't want to lose our place and have to start over (in my sudden pee panic, having my wife hold our place didn't occur to me), so I unzipped my pants, popped open the flap and proceeded to pee as I continued to count paces. When I got to the last number, I stopped and finished up. I turn to see my wife staring at me in what I like to believe was amazement, but probably more along the lines of dumbfounded confusion. All she managed to get out was, \"That was a new one for me.\" She's never brought it up since, but sometimes I think about it and wonder what her thought process was and how much regret she was having for marrying me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to answer your question: it's there for making our wives question our very existence in their lives.",

I've got combinations of underwear and pants that I don't really wear unless I have to because the hole is too low and the zipper is too high, which squeezes the stream and makes a dribble when I put everything back.

Once I realized i needed to develop different habits it was pretty natural, but had I not had the catalyst to make me learn I may have always been on the pulling the pants slightly down team \n\n\nIf you want your husband to stop doing this, buy him a gunbelt.

You might buy underwear with that hole just to try it, you might continue buying the same kind of underwear your parents kept buying, or whatever. Chances are, by the age of 20, you were pissing by pulling your underwear down.\nNow whenever I buy a pair of boxers I go for a combination of comfort and design. If it has a whole or it doesn't, I don't care, as long is looks good. But considering that having that whole is not a necessity for me, I have boxer with and without it. So whenever I go pee, you can be certain I will not stop to ponder what kind of boxers am I wearing right now or even bother checking. I just whip it out and pee. \nPS: As a bonus, taking it out through that hole, takes a good 2-5 seconds more than just pulling it down.",

Big vs little hands (dexterity), size of member (super small and super big are probably hardest to fetch out of your underwear.
