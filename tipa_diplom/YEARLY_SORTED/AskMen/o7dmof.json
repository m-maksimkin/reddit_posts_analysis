    "Men of Reddit how do you really feel about giving your gf oral sex?\nEdit: The reason I ask is because my boyfriend of three years won’t do it. When I ask him why he doesn’t give me any reason or says he has, but it’s only been once or twice and very brief. I do everything I’m supposed to do on my end (I.e. Brazilian). Can you tell me why he might not feel the way most of you do? I reciprocate more than regularly. It’s something I’ve never gotten to experience and I’m afraid I never will. It’s also seriously messing with my self-esteem. I humbly say I’m a very pretty girl and I’ve never had to worry about feeling so insecure before. It’s gotten me really out of sorts. whatever it is I just want to know. If it’s me, or if he doesn’t like it , or if he just freaks him out I just want him to tell me what it is. Because I guess I’m assuming it’s not normal not to want to do it ever.\n\nANOTHER EDIT AND A GOOD ONE!! First, I want to say thank you to everyone who sent me messages with thoughts and suggestions. Y’all were all respectful, considerate and gave me productive ideas about communicating with him. Well, I took your advice and guess who had their first oral orgasm tonight!! Now I know what all the fuss is about! Thanks Reddit friends!": [

Put sexual exploration on the agenda.  Make it an active part your sex life, so that you're always mixing things up just a little.

            "text": "Sex done right is about love for your partner. The true joys of sex are the gift of pleasure to the other person. If I buy myself a gift it is enjoyable but considerably less meaningful then when the same gift is purchased for me. Sex is best approached in a selfless manner provided your partner is also approaching it in this way. Perhaps that is something both of you should bear in mind. While difficult, attempt to focus on the pleasure of the other. Tactically, in order to appeal to that self interested side, it is a much more difficult thing to deny someone a request if they have been selflessly providing you with an excellent experience which caters their desires. \n\nOf course, perhaps you don't want to ask. Maybe this is for the best. After all, it's best when people just do what you want without instruction, especially in the bedroom.\n\nYour partner is likely more dominant. Perhaps he is reluctant to provide pleasure because he is concerned that it will be perceived as a service as opposed to a gift, putting him in the submissive sexual position. M on F oral is a notoriously femdom thing, even though it is much more then that, and asking him to do it would not help this case. \n\nOf course, linking back, if he begins to see the true value of sex as the pleasure of the partner, and he begins to quantify his dominance by this metric, then, being that oral sex is scientifically the most effective pleasuring tool, he will begin to find it more attractive. \n\nThis is a task, as dominance in our society continually revolves more around self interest. The dominant role model character for the man is no longer the chivalrous powerful knight in shining armour, who has been reduced to his pathetic keyboard defending, but the player, the bad boy. One of them gives, one of them takes. Both are dominant, but the former is cultural dethroned. Unfortunately, that's the one you want, because the bad boy believes his power comes from his mere ability to create an effect. He places himself above others he deems less impactful and the idea of serving them disgusts him with its submissive nature. The Bad boy is essentially the baby tyrant. \n\nThe Prince Charming is essentially the hero, who believes that dominance can only be found in the positive impact he has on others. As such, that which is selfless, whatever burden he can carry is a noble goal which he can be proud of. He is servant of the world around him but, in being this, gains the dominance of being the worlds best hope and most prized member. \n\nOf course, nobody ever truly embodies the epitome of these characters and the debate of who is truly more dominant rages on... The primary difference between the two is, however, simple moral perspective. I know it may seem we are far from oral sex now, but if your hubby does seem more like the bad boy who idolises iced up rappers talking about fuckin loads of hoes and killing people while he's road raging at dear old gran In her nissan Micra because is blocking his view of the Lamborghini infornt, then perhaps he needs that moral perspective to get him thinking about others first. Speaking of coming first, if he does do this great psychological pivot, I suggest he reads the book \"She Comes First\" by Ian Kerner, it may open his eyes as to why this is such a desirable thing. (I'd like to point out that Lambos and rap are not inherently morally wrong, but they are preferred in greater proportion by adherents of this archetype). \n\n If your partner is a submissive man... This shouldn't really be a problem, just make him do it. \n\nAnyway, we know the dominance/self interest thing might be an issue. How can we get some short term results. Perhaps 69 would be a useful gateway activity, it is more immediately reciprocal and blatantly the least submissive form of oral short of a 3some (which, if your interested in my opinions, I do not condone). Reward his efforts to do this for you when he makes them. If he does it 1 time for 15 seconds, you give that mother fucker the ride of his life. He'll come back doing it for longer. About rewards, reward him like a king or a hero, not like a dog or a child, feel your way, the difference is notable, the results will differ notably too. Make him feel extremely powerful with the reward. Use it as a way of expressing how passionate it makes you feel that he has done this with you. You want him to ask you afterwards \"WOW what's gotten into you today?!\" And you say \"You did\", but actually you say how unbelievably turned on you were when he was going down on you and you couldn't help yourself but to serve him in whatever way was most pleasurable to him. That shit right there would solve your issue in a hot minute. \n\nAnother few things:\nDon't talk about how much you liked it when other guys did it in the past, that's a 0IQ move, he's just gonna start thinking about how he's..\n\nKissing dick. Its a problem, it even made it into a popular rap lyric. Whether it's his or someone elses he's thinking about because the dick has been where he's licking. If it's someone else's, that's a way bigger problem and it ain't only his. If it's his, that's only his because in his life he has probably lick plenty worse things. With any luck, time, sensitivity and big rewards will solve that. If you feel it could be a thing, avoid including oral in your round 2 foreplay.\n\nKeep the girl clean. I cannot stand the taste of panty fluff on my fuckin tongue. \n\nSome guys just don't like how pussy looks. Doesn't make them gay, but it can certainly make them less privy to oral. I don't have a solution for this, just gets better over time but tbh, with the whole pussy Art and the general politicisation of the image of pussy, if your not inline with the group's who are promoting that kind of shit, it can feel like your kissing their symbology, which is uncomfortable. \n\nI know a lot of this shit doesn't sound rational but it's the rationality of the subconscious, which, I assure you, is extremely rational. \n\nGet some flavoured lube, if he wants to finger you, use the lube and then he will have a good flavour when he's down there. \n\nFlavour is often based on you mental state. Think of the child who turns his nose up at the disgusting brócoli he hates only to eat it in his brócoli soup chopped up without knowing. Think how good normal water tastes when you deathly thirsty. If he doesn't like the flavour, it could very well be aided by working on the psychological perspectives above. In the mean time, pussy tastes better with wine. \n\nThat's all folks",

These cancers are caused by excessive drinking or smoking, and also by HPV. “HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer (the part of the throat directly behind the mouth) is twice as common in men than women, and is most common in heterosexual men in their 40s and 50s.” There are many kinds of HPV, but the ones that cause head and neck cancer are some of the same that cause cervical and other anogenital cancers. Most people with HPV do not know they have it because it may not cause symptoms for many years after contracting it. Men are known to contract and cary HPV in their oropharynx more than women are. The risk is known to increase with the number of oral sex partners one has in their lifetime. It is suspected cunnilingus exposes the performer to a high viral load from vaginal secretions and makes transmission of the virus more likely than other forms of sexual activity like fellatio. Some types of HPV infection can be prevented with various vaccines. In recent years, these vaccines have become available to more adult men.

She'll be 100% sure to tell me what works, what doesn't, and climaxes will come quickly (haha - pun). Notice what I just said? How many of you will miss it, I wonder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, there are the rest. Oh, my, do we have issues there, ladies. Major issues.\n\nA tongue can be an instrument of pleasure, but if you take a bow and start pushing it against a violin without any knowledge of how it works, misery is the result.\n\nI cannot read your mind, ladies, nor is it easy to tell if you're \"getting there\". 99% of the time, you just lay there. No moans, no instruction, just... wait for it, I guess?\n\nI hate going down on women like this. It's misery for me, because I have no clue what's going on. After a few minutes, I'm thinking to myself, \"is she feeling anything?\", \"Ok, there's a bit of movement, focus here... ah shit, nothing now.\", or sometimes, \"Goddamn, girl! Say or do something for fuck's sake! This is murder on my back like this!\"\n\nWhat's worse in this situation is I expressly tell them before going down to let me know how things go. Is this interpreted as \"After I'm done?\" No, I don't think so.\n\nLadies get it first in my book. Always been this way. Always will be. I get *very turned on* when a girl orgasms, and well, that just makes it fun for both of us.\n\nI have zero issue of performing the task (and we both wash first, so no issues there).\n\nI have issue with women who do or say nothing during the presentation. They're not a damn corpse, so why act like one.\n\nI've ended relationships on this lack of communication. I know it's a huge issue in American society because far too many people are ignorant/shamed about sex thanks to idiot adults, but damn, it shouldn't be like this.\n\nOh, and one more thing: TURN ON THE FUCKING LIGHTS!\n\nIt helps reduce the anxiety.\n\nYou're supposed to be partners, not things that go bump in the night!",

It's my favorite form of intercourse, and I'm more readily turned on by a woman who is able to somehow let me know of her inclination towards similar delights. Sadly, I never really enjoy receiving oral. I'm incapable of orgasming that way it seems, strangely enough. \n\nI know why, of course. I have always had confidence issues, and can't easily see value in myself. As a result, I'm always trying to read others to test for their approval, and I desperately wish to make others happy so the anxiety leave my body and mind in peace. In oral sex, as long as the woman is expressive and honest, my absolute need to please others combined with my hyperawareness of other peoples approval turns my typically crippling anxieties into my greatest tools for pleasing my mate. When I'm lucky enough to have my head so blessedly buried between a woman's thighs, I can feel her excitement,  approval, desires, pleasures through the moans and motions of her body. My focus on her pleasure and the waxing and waning interplay involved in building a powerful orgasm with her excites me far, FAR more than any orgasm I can have physically.\n\nI'm glad you asked this question, as it's really quite creepy if I tell anyone this otherwise, but as I never see it demonstrated in common media I felt rather alone in this. I'm glad to see others are of a similar taste as well, helps me not feel so much the freak.",

If you're then able to show him how good of a time you're having and how great it feels for you. I'm sure he'll be seeing diamonds after it!\n\nI've explained this technique to a couple of my less experienced guy friends before and less than 24 hours later they're telling me they love it, because it makes their partner feel great, it in turn makes them feel accomplished, which in turn makes them satisfied.\n\nIt's about separating physical pleasure from emotional pleasure.

A lot of men first experience oral sex when they are very young. Two factors can lead to them not feeling very confident. The first is that they're just not very good at it. Nothing shatters a guy's confidence like being totally willing to go down only to be told that they're terrible. \n\nThe second factor is that a lot of young women don't know how to take care of themselves, so the first experience can have a taste/smell that is off-putting. That memory can last a long time.\n\nThe reality is that both problems can be solved with grooming and practice, so even if your bf is hesitant about trying it, just make him feel totally comfortable about trying something out without expecting results. I say this because the way you describe yourself seems like you feel as though you deserve it even if your partner is really uncomfortable with it. That's not a great mindset to have with a partner you care about. Sex should be something you both enjoy, no matter what act you're performing, so have a conversation about his hang ups with oral sex and see if you can work something out.",

For some extremely strange reason none of my guy friends have never experienced this and some chicks I have told never thought of it. Anyway, in my first serious relationship where I had consistent sex and unprotected sex and we experimented on each other I tried going down on her. So, it didn’t smell at all, it tasted like what a pussy should taste like, but after about 10 seconds I had horrible cotton mouth, almost as if there was a film on my tongue and I couldn’t salivate and I was getting choked up. So then I started kissing on her and got to her neck, put my dick in and started fucking her and then put my face in my sheets where I then licked my sheets until all the residue was off of my tongue. After that I just finished fucking. Wasn’t too hyped on going back for round 2 for a while until I finally gave it a 2nd try. Same exact thing, cotton mouth 10 seconds in, filmy residue and couldn’t salivate. So I thought and thought and thought about it until it hit me like a brick. She took a piss earlier in the day or multiple times and when she cleaned herself there was little toilet paper residuals on her. So when I was going down I was licking up toilet paper fuzz that’s why I got cotton mouth and such. So that’s my reason. After 2 bad sessions I just don’t have a desire to do it, but if I do it’s definitely going to be after she has a nice shower. But if I never have to eat pussy again I won’t complain, sex is fine with me.",

            "text": "Not long before I started having sex, a close but platonic acquaintance told me she really liked giving head, because of the feeling of control: with just a little bit of effort, she was having a powerful effect on a guy. I filed that away, and then the first time I gave head to a woman, my god did I understand what she meant. It's like the primal power of the woman's orgasm is running through my body, as is my own power in making it happen. Ever since, it's been one of my favorite things in life.\n\nI've been with a few women who weren't crazy about it, and we've found other ways to fulfill each other's needs. So I can live without it (and could live without fellatio too), as long as I felt like my partner was pretty dedicated to pleasing me and was getting plenty of pleasure from me. But I'd be remembering what I was missing.\n\nAnecdotally, lots of women on reddit and other forums report that lots of men don't like giving head. Go figure. So your bf apparently isn't unusual, and it's apparently not about you--some guys just have an aversion to it. Some say they don't like the taste or smell, but I don't think that's really what it's about. I've done it a couple thousand times and maybe a half-dozen of those times, there was a faint smell of pee (a quick swipe with a washcloth is a good idea). But I've never encountered any bad smells other than that--the natural taste and smell of pussy isn't really very strong, and it's kinda nice.\n\nI think the real reason a lot of men are averse to cunnilingus is because they associate it with being subservient to a woman, which they figure is gay or something. But like my friend said, the person giving head is really the one with the power--I feel sorry for anyone who hasn't had that experience.\n\nBut also, it's different for women: a guy could go without head and still come every time he has sex (I'd rather come in a pussy than a mouth, but I like the variety). Most women don't come from penetration, so mouth or hands or vibrator are essential. If you're getting plenty of orgasms from hands or vibrator when you have sex with your bf (or if you're one of those few lucky women who come from penetration alone), then you might want to stay with him in spite of missing cunnilingus. But if you've never really had it (meaning had it good), then you can't know what you're missing, so you might want to check it out one way or another before deciding to spend your life with this guy. And if you're *not* getting plenty of orgasms, thanks to his inattention and lack of imagination, then you should definitely dump his ass yesterday.\n\nBest of luck!",

Luckily I could still go down on her because it was very faint, but it was sort of an acquired taste situation. \n\nThe thing is, oral sex is actually quite different between men and women because a penis doesn't produce a flavoured fluid constantly like a vagina does.\n\nThe thing is, there might be a very very honest conversation in your future where you find out that he's either kind of a dipshit for whatever lazy reason he has to not do it, or he might not like the taste so much for a relatively legitimate reason. \n\nWhatever you do, don't take it to heart. Every woman is going to taste different, and I would guess that it's probably very rare for a woman to just taste bad completely.

I love doing it and the idea, but sometimes I just really don't want to.\n\nAs a sidenote, you should probably bring up the fact that you feel this way because you aren't getting a straight answer. Chances are he doesn't wanna say anything that MIGHT hurt your feelings. Alot of the time, I don't like doing it on my girlfriends period (fucking, not eating her out.) and I used to use her period as an excuse to say no with a reason because I didn't want her feeling bad. Turns out now she gets more upset on her period because she thinks I think she's disgusting, when in reality, because of the blood, it makes it less enjoyable as I have to clean and be careful. \n\nIf you confront your boyfriend, avoid using phrases that imply that your upset that he's not doing it, and that your upset because you don't feel like your getting a real answer. Maybe he doesn't like it, but feels like if he says that you might be upset, and tries to avoid it to spare you. \n\nI feel like alot of the time, it's a valid reason, and never to do with you specifically. I've never not wanted to do something purely or indirectly because of my girlfriend. It's always external forces like exhaustion, or mood, or preference. I don't like being hurt, or hit, or smacked. It's not because my girlfriend is a bad hitter or something, it's because I don't like pain. Chances are he doesn't like it because of a bad experience, or because he's never found interest and doesn't want to. \n\nIf this will help, ask yourself this. Would you eat his ass if he asked you to? If you said no, your in a similar situation as him. You don't necessarily want to avoid something purely because of him, but the act itself. \n\nSex is really tricky. It's the glue of a relationship, but also the pry bar. Sex can really fuck with your brain and relationship if you let these ideas boil. Sex problems suck, because 99% of the time it's not your fault, but your gonna feel like it is. Just know that if there's things you won't do because you simply don't want to, it's the same thing for him, but different acts. \n\nI'm here if you want to ask me questions, either publicly or privately in dms.

There was this very strong awful taste and when combined with smell, you get a partner who doesn't want to go anywhere near there.\n2. Texture: some people don't like how it feels on their tongue\n3. Too much hair. I know this is a very Controversial topic in this here parts of town, but too much hair makes it hard for some people to enjoy it. Be it the feeling of hair in their mouth or constantly trying to move hair out of the way. Low trim does help.\n4. Previous Bad experiences. Maybe a previous partner insult his skills thereby traumatizing him. Men can assaulted too, which removes some sexual acts from the table for them\n5. Lack of experience. Contrary to what you read here, not everyone is a God at going down on their partner \n5. He's doesn't just like it. Just like it's OK for women not to want to go down on men, it's OK to for men to do the same. It's not for everyone and he should not be forced or coerced or nagged until he gives in.\n\nOP, I would suggest talking with him and trying to figure out why he's reluctant to go down on you.

It could be moaning, it could be just seeing move crazily as you’re being eaten, it could be you being more passionate during the act. It’s not to say that it’s your problem, but out of pragmatism, you can use your charm to get him there.

Hygiene is the only reason I can see him not wanting to that would be your fault and it is clear that you have that handled well.\n\nFor this, you need to sit down, not during or near sexy times, and ask him if he is comfortable with it.  There may be some past trauma such as an abusive partner.  For example, this is common with women as men can sometimes pull their head onto their penis.  As a result, I make a point to never touch the back of the head during a blowjob. \n\nBe judgment free and do not talk about reciprocation.  You are not owed oral sex because you gave him it.  Ask open ended questions and listen actively.  I would mention that it is affecting your self esteem to not know why he does not prefer to and ask that he be honest even if the truth may hurt as your mind is likely to jump to much more hurtful places not knowing.  This helps him see how important it is to talk about it.  If his reasoning is not a hard no such as abuse, ask what he may like to make it more inviting. If it is a hard no, accept it or decide if it is a deal breaker. \n\nFinally, if he is just indifferent, I would try to elicit interest in him.  For me, the sensation of and ability to watch the slow pulsations build to the crescendo of orgasm is a great experience.  It makes it a pleasure to give oral that happens to also be a pleasure to my partner.",

The lubrication of the whole thing makes penetration much better, or just possible in the case of a couple of exes, and I definitely get direct pleasure there. Hair wouldn't put me off but I'd rather not if she'd been out dancing all night without a shower. To answer the question, I was happy to do it.\n\nThe thing is I get certain sex acts being a turn off for some people. A lot of people enjoy French kissing, I think it's grim, there might be some associations with eating cow's tongue as a child idk. The texture is just horrid, like chewing your own tongue.\n\nYou could, as an alternative, get one of those oral sex toys and see if he's willing to use it on you. Or just get one and use it on yourself if not. \n\nI wouldn't personally carry on giving oral to someone who didn't reciprocate. I learned that lesson with one gf who's attitude was to lie there while I serviced her and thought that was fine because I was enjoying myself. There were other issues in that relationship and it didn't last long.\n\nThat he's unwilling to give you a reason doesn't bode well. It seems likely to me that an unwillingness to open up to answer the question and to do the deed are probably related, ie he has some repression/hangup. Is he otherwise willing to talk about the difficult stuff? He may not consciously know why he doesn't like it and it's some subconscious issue. \n\nGuessing at the reasons here but what occurs is he doesn't like the smell even if you are perfectly clean. Lady parts have a smell and it's usually fine so don't worry about this. Some people just have odour sensitivity apparently. He has some trauma connected with it in the past. He's afraid of being bad at it. He has some phobia about bacteria. He doesn't think it's a 'manly' thing to do. \n\nThat's all pointless speculation though, I suggest you explain very clearly to him what effect this is having on you and you need a straight answer. I doubt he's considered that. It's tricky because he might make something up because he's unwilling to say.",

            "text": "There's no such thing as \"it's not normal\" with regards to sexuality, only what is a turn on for the individual, and whether it's done with true consent.  You can't get someone to be turned on by something they're just not into, and you can't rationalise something they *are* turned on by.  It just works or doesn't.\n\nAs is probably already evident in this thread (I've not read the responses, but I don't really have too...) there will be a hundred different reasons for why men do, or don't want to go down on a woman. Personally I love doing it, but I've had one female partner who absolutely *wouldn't* let me, for reasons I can understand but aren't fair to discuss here.\n\nIt didn't mean she, or you aren't beautiful because one particular part of sexuality wasn't expressed; you can have the most beautiful fuzzy peach in the world but if someone just doesn't like peaches... but if it's something you *need* and your partner isn't prepared to share that with you, you should seriously consider if that person is ultimately right for you. Everyone should be happy and fulfilled in a relationship.\n\nHow do you address that then?\n\nYou've already asked; but have you told him how unhappy and insecure not experiencing it makes you feel? The BIG one, for any partner who is worth keeping, is that he is failing to make you happy.  Even if you can't encourage him to take a trip down south, if he doesn't at least respond to being told he's making you insecure you've got a very, very clear signal he's not the best partner for you. Good partners *care*.\n\nThere's a few ways you can make it more appealing to him. If he has neurosis about doing it, you can try and minimize those; in particular I suspect cleanliness is the big turn off for many. Point out that you're clean and any wetness is specifically lubricant that being horny for him has created, it's a sign of his personal talent and sexiness.\n\nUse some of the more romantic, simple answers you get here to describe what he can get to do... *don't go into the more fetishistic ones until you know his own more hidden desires*. \nFor me, the big turn on is it's something most women wouldn't even mention to other men, the ultimate private area, and I get to completely explore it.  I have a friend who loves golden showers/urine play. It grosses everyone else out. Don't talk in those terms until you know that's what he might be into.\n\nMake it clear that oral sex is both very, very easy to do and you'll let him know when he's on the right track... which is really all the secret to great oral sex is; She gives hints, you follow them unselfishly. Oh, and help keep him \"on the button\" as it were (or rather in my experience, around and around the button with your tongue)  by, if you tend to writhe around a lot, keeping your hips steady enough so he can help you help yourself... Performance anxiety can be a big one for men, and if he's already hesitant but goes there briefly and fails to get you off, he may be too insecure to do it again. Explain it's not fast, but if he's patient he'll see something beautiful that no other man got to see, you getting to orgasm...\n\nBut again, he just may not be into oral sex. It's nothing wrong with you, or even him. Just not a good match between you two. Explain you need it, and it's not something he can just never share and have you be secure and happy too.  The talking about it is going to be the hardest part. Good luck.",

            "text": "OP I'm no psychologist or cultural guru but I suspect some (perhaps majority) men don't like giving head are for the following reasons:\n\n1 there is a stigma of varying degrees around the female body. Sometimes people are convinced / told that it's inherently dirty. I know this isn't true, as long as people practice hygiene they're normally gonna be fine. This may be a perception of cleanliness problem.\n\n2 Toxic masculinity. This is kind of a catch all phrase for male failings but \"masculine\" men aren't often described as sensitive / caring, which are traits that would lead you to gratifying your partner. Pleasuring your partner is often described as a submissive act and therefore not fit for men. IMO oral sex is neither submissive nor dominant until you make it submissive or dominant. This would be a personality problem.\n\n3 some people really can't handle the taste. Honestly sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't. When pussy tastes weird to me I simply add more saliva to drown out the questionable flavor. So far it has worked well for me. OP your SO may have a flavor issue which is understandable but there are work arounds.\n\nI don't know your partner or your relationship so I can't infer a lot. However its best to assume your partner isn't being intentionally malicious. If you can use I statements to communicate your feelings to him you can begin breaking down this problem. You can relate to him that his not reciprocating oral makes you feel insecure. I'm assuming he's not a total A-hole but instead someone who's absorbed some toxic culture from his parents / peers, and therefore hasn't given eating pussy a real go.\n\nBest of luck OP",

            "text": "Real answer because Captain White Knight is a Reddit plea for upvotes.\n\n\"It depends\".\n\n\"Girls are always worried\"... So fun fact. Women worry. (Dodges gender warrior hate). Men can theoretically impregnate multiple women per day while a woman takes 9 months to gestate a baby. So women are a little more sexually cautious. And that's okay. But when you say \"most men say they like oral but most women say no man will perform it\" there's a LOT of women preventing men from even trying with the whole but the smell thing, and there's a lot of douchebag men who are bad at it. Let's work together, okay?\n\nTaste/smell. I've had girlfriends who tasted like nectar every single time. Just sweet and lovely. I've also had girlfriends who don't have a DMZ between the backdoor and the front door so it can be rancid. Here's one excellent metric. When you want some good sex, is your first thought that you should take a shower? I do. To be fair I'm recovering OCD but still. My wife is the sort who even when I hint that's she not fresh will still say \"well I showered yesterday\". If you're that girl, TAKE THE HINT. Check with your partner. We all sweat, and if your partner says \"yeah once in a while your ass stinks so sex doesn't happen\" that's okay! You can fix that with plumbing. Also - you know some guys have hangups about their mouth/breath right? Let him brush his teeth if he's worried.\n\nDifficulty. Many girls take a LONG time to get off - particularly if they use vibrators or some other specific way of getting off all the time so they only get off quickly with their favorite tool. Some girls are attacking their clitoris like they're mad at it and they wonder why a tongue doesn't get them off rapidly. If you take 20 minutes to orgasm from oral, you'd better watch the clock next time you go down on me and tease me like all hell. Sometimes it's easy though. Some girls can have 12 straight orgasms no matter what you do (and yes actual orgasms - fluids all over the bedroom, the whole deal). It depends. Again - just show appropriate appreciation for the level of effort. Ask your partner if you have a balance. Sometimes that's the real problem. Why would your man go down on you, if you don't show him the same love?\n\nOpportunity. Also an underrated factor. If you're just randomly saying \"why don't you go down on me\" that's not actually trying. Imagine instead that your boyfriend has been hinting he's horny, so you grab a shower, you call him to the bedroom, and when he gets there you've got the buffet laid out. Most men will jump at the chance. Or if he's like hold on, I'm going to need a shower so we can get REALLY freaky, don't get mad at him! He might be a little self conscious too.\n\nTLDR - Most women are more worried about their smell than they have to be. Most men have been discouraged from giving good head. You need to work together - in particular, planning time to shower together so you're both clean, and make sure you're both contributing equally to the oral situation in bed. Or whatever you both like. Maybe you want oral and he wants his prostate played with, and you're both failing to do your duty. Talk about it.",

Some people are givers, some are takers, and some are balanced. \n\nAs a general rule, you should be able to talk to your partner and express your desires. You risk discovering an incompatibility, but that’s a good thing. The sooner you discover you’re not compatible, the sooner you can explore new relationships with people who are compatible with you. Conversely, maybe there is a simple misunderstanding based on some innocuous conversation you had at the beginning of the relationship. Or maybe your parter is insecure and doesn’t really know how to please you (or anyone for that matter). \n\nMy advice is to talk to them and be direct. “I noticed you don’t go down on me with the frequency I’d like. I really enjoy it. Is there something I can do on my end to make that a more frequent thing?”\n\nIf he rejects you for any reason, it’s not really your fault. He has a right to his preferences. Trust me on this one. I’m a complete savage. I had a partner completely lose control and farted while I was going down on her. I laughed about it and made her feel comfortable even though she was embarrassed. For the record, I’m not into farts. Just saying that my adoration of her went well beyond. I took pride in my ability to make her lose control. My intention was to give her pleasure at any cost. I succeeded. \n\nAnyhow, talk it out, or walk out. Either way, you’ll be closer to getting what you want. Just don’t assume it’s you. It might be, from his perspective, but someone out there will still be into you…",

Please be sure you're doing it for you. \n\nAnd also - while, I stick by my earlier statement about you doing what you want with your body- the fact is that a hairless vulva is a sign of a prepubescent body. Some men are *very* uncomfortable with being intimate with one, face to face.   You may ask him about his thoughts on that. It very well could be that you're doing this thing to your body in the mistaken idea that you are supposed to, when he doesn't want it anyways. \n\nThen there's people who just don't enjoy doing it...and that's valid. I don't find it selfish - no one is obligated to perform a sex act on another person. You're not obligated to give him head either, and its not selfish. \n\nHe might not like holding his head like that. It might be a texture/wetness issue (I'm autistic and while I love the idea of idea of kissing my partner after they've performed oral, in practice it's tricky because of my aversion to wetness on my face). He might have been told he was awful at it and is insecure about trying again. \n\nThere's many reasons why it isn't a thing he's into and it's much more likely that it's about him than anything you're doing \"wrong\".",

Although there are a few factors that might be off putting. \n\nFirstly if she's not clean, then gross. \n\nSecondly if a girl is aroused then at the risk of being crass, it can be an unpleasant and even overwhelming smell. Sometimes it's like sticking your face into a sauna. \n\nThirdly, a lot of girls will get some residue build up from other foreplay. \n\nLastly, not all vaginas are the same. Some women are just harder physically to get to and performing oral can be uncomfortable or even painful. And to be frank, some just look nicer than others.\n\nIt's a really hard thing to tell a girl. Especially when mostly it's not her fault. What I do does depend on my own mood somewhat. You could ask him honestly, it might just be something he doesn't like doing. \n\nIf I can offer advice, then it's to make sure you're clean (I'm sure you are already though), but a little discreet wipe if you've been aroused for a while might be of help. And especially if you're somewhat larger, try to make your lady bits easier to get to by lifting your hips, pulling your legs up/back, positioning yourself on the edge of a bed or even trying different positions, depending on how he might like to go about it and whether your physical characteristics are complicating things. \n\nProbably the biggest thing for me though is the idea of giving and expecting it back. I just find it a little uncomfortable that if one gives oral then the other \"owes\" it. I just think the act is a selfless one and should be done out of desire and not expectation. Unless you've got some sort of agreement, like if you both dislike doing it but love getting it and think the payoff is worth the output.",

At first I thought it was gross, then when I got the urge to do it I was too scared of not knowing what I was doing.\n\nHere are some considerations in no particular order.\n\n1. No need to go childish bald, but it's helpful to trim up honestly just so it's easier to perform and access. \n\n2. Ask him if it would help to tell him what you'd like\n\n3. Tell him it's actually an important sexual desire of yours. Make sure he values your desires\n\n4. Consider something playful like a thong made of candy  or other harmless \"toys\" that make it sound more fun.\n\nI'm guessing you're both young and he just hasn't figured it out yet. As you're both figuring out yourselves sexually, be patient with one another and be good communicators. \n\nLastly, I'm just going to say women deserve oral sex. If he just refuses to give it, it's possible he is a bit selfish and doesn't really value your relationship, or it's possible he has an issue with it that isn't you at all, it's the concept. There are women who don't require it. That's a compatibility consideration. For me, I like receiving oral sex, but I frequently get so aroused with foreplay and giving it that I go straight to intercourse without receiving and am completely satisfied with that or with oral sex as a selfish treat just for me.

Having preferences isn't bad and him not wanting to do something shouldn't be seen as your failure, it's just something he doesn't want to do.

I was at her place, and she had just gotten home from the gym. We started making out and things got heavy quickly. So I go down on her and OH MY GOD, the smell was just overwhelmingly bad. Like rotten fish left in the sun for a week bad! I gagged, but didn´t want to make her feel bad so I kept going a little longer. Then when we were having sex I just couldn´t get that smell out of my head (and my face), so I made an excuse and left, never to see her again.\n\nWhy the hell couldn´t she have said \"hold up, let me take a shower, I just came from the gym\".

However, you can help show him there are ways to eat you out in a \"non-submissive\" fashion (gripping the legs, hoisting them up, bringing the vagina lips to him.)\n\n* **Inexperience:** Men want to seem good or impressive at something. He may feel anxious that he won't be able to perform because, well, he hasn't done it before, and it may be a blow to his self-esteem. He wants to feel desirable in bed, and if he finds out he's bad at oral, is may make him feel undesirable. If you make it clear it's about feeling like you're cared for and not about how well he does it (and also if you can look up some tips for him), he may be more willing.\n\n* **Hygiene:** Unbeknownst to you, you may have a mild hygiene problem that you aren't aware of. (This is true of a lot of people, men and women, don't take it personally.) This means that, on the night you want him to give it a try (and honestly, on the regular if you want to get rid of any chronic problems), wash well. Don't use scented soaps that leave a scent (because they can be bitter), but do wash and scrub thoroughly.\n\nIf it continues to bother you, you both need to talk about it openly and comfortably as those in an honest relationship would.\n\nI will say, while it's okay if he just doesn't want to, I also don't think it's a terribly huge deal for him to reciprocate once in a while just because he feels for you. But if it's *that* big of a No-Button (maybe he has some very negative experiences before that are causing some trauma), then be gentle about it. Relationships are tough.\n\n---\n\nQuick question, if you don't mind. What do you mean by this?\n\n> I do everything I’m supposed to do on my end (I.e.

            "text": "Honestly, I find it can be kinda hit or miss. In general, I absolutely love it because I love giving my partners all the best experiences I can muster. Unfortunately, that normally comes at the cost of a piece of flesh under my tongue connecting it to the bottom of my mouth gets torn a bit at the base. Nothing major, but it’ll be sore/hurt for a couple days then it’s fine. \n\nAnother thing that makes it hit or miss for me can be the flavour. I’ve literally had partners get their pussy all cleaned up the same way on two completely different days and had two different flavours. Sometimes there’s just nothing that can be done. Also, not only can a pussy’s flavour change but so can a person’s tastes. For example, I’ve come to realize I like bitter flavours more in the fall for whatever reason. \n\nI’ve also experienced more than one woman squirt in my face/mouth. Depending on a couple things like what a partner ate and how much water she’s had to drink affects that flavour too. \n\nI guess what I’m getting at here is that there’s so many possible things to either enjoy, fee neutral about, or feel are unpleasant for some reason but none of them are your fault. There’s nothing wrong on your end, especially if you’re getting cleaned up and waxed. \n\nThere’s even the possibility that your boyfriend doesn’t even know why it’s not a more predominant act in his repertoire. \n\nThe best advice I can give, if you’re looking for advice, is find a way to further develop your communication skills (and encourage him to do the same if possible) so that you can clearly and concisely discuss topics like this and find mutually accepted compromises. It’s not easy, but if you both put in the work, your personal and sex lives together will improve significantly because it’ll give you both a platform to open up about more sensitive/embarrassing/self-conscious things and you two can both explore each other’s desires or find compromises for the things you two find aren’t compatible. \n\nNo matter what though, I wish you the best.

I have experienced nearly every woman tell me I have not found the right woman to do it right. And I try to explain it is also mental for me (the idea of someone sucking my dick is rarely appealing, though there has been the occasion or two).\n\nI would argue the advantage is I am not a selfish lover. I thoroughly enjoy getting the woman I am with off multiple times. My technique ranges from using the tongue, fingers, palm of my hand, various pressures, blowing, and even some talking. I like to get in your head and heart as much as I pay attention to your body. I most certainly like to tease too, and keeping you guessing. The surprise is part of the fun.  But I can also follow directions when the woman I am with likes to be in control. \n\nBut I digress. Giving a woman oral is indeed a pleasurable experience (for both).",

I doubt that even if his bros were talking up how awesome it is that he would change his mind.

If he still refuses then you need to think seriously about moving on. Sexual frustration will kill your relationship slowly.

So here is a bit of advice.\n\nMy first recommendation is to tell him you want to 69. This is asking for oral while offering oral. In that moment he has to decide if getting oral is worth giving oral and comes off as less of a request and more of an offer. You can also try showering together and then asking for oral/69 because perceived hygiene is a big factor for most peoples willingness to 69.\n\nIf you manage to get him to give you oral make sure you tell him afterwards that you liked it even if it wasn't great (men have feelings too and can be very sensitive about their sexual performance). If you hated it and don't want to do it again of course tell him that but if there was something not so great about it more practice will probably fix that and telling him he did poorly might make him not want to do it again. You don't have to like to him and tell him he is the worlds best but make sure you let him know you enjoyed that he did that for you.\n\n\nFinally remember that everybody is entitled to their own sexual preferences. You can ask and try to work with him but ultimately that decision is up to him. He may someday change his mind on it though so it never hurts to ask. If oral is super important to you stress that to him but please don't give him an ultimatum like \"give me oral or we are braking up\" because that constitutes rape in some states.",

Like you obviously have no problem with oral, as I’m down here sucking dick (or eating your gf out) but then will draw the line at reciprocating? You need to find something he can do for you that isn’t oral to meet your needs in the foreplay department. And I really hope he does and I just don’t have all the information. You deserve to have your bodies’ nerves stimulated to promote healthy intercourse. Otherwise you’re just being a tool and only achieving the satisfaction of having pleased your partner.

I actually find it to be a huge turn on and a great preface to sex.  And since women, in my experience can have multiple orgasms, you can make a girl cum, then move on to sex and make her cum again.

Not only this, it really helps in bed as you're always ensuring she gets hers as well as you getting yours.\n\nOlder traditional guys might not like it because they believe it's dirty, like them putting their mouth on somewhere other penises might have been etc. but that's kind of the dumbest thing i've heard since it's not like the penis is suddenly the cleanest genital. \n\nI'd ask if it's because he's uncomfortable? Is he afraid of exploring your body because he wouldn't know how to work them? Does he think it's dirty? \n\nIt really confuses me why a guy would be so against it that he lets his girl go down on him for 3 years but refuses to do it himself. Is it because hes disgusted with putting his mouth where his penis has been? He uses his hands to wipe his ass.",

Double check to make sure. Id suggest getting freaky right after you take a shower. If he still wont do it then it proves its not because you dont clean enough.  \n\n\nHowever, I dont think that is the case. He is just one of those guys that wont do it and gives all the other guys a bad reputation. I was dating a woman and she told me how thankful she was that I gave her oral sex. I was surprised about how much of a big deal it is because I would always give a woman oral, as long as she was clean. I enjoy it. I like watching a woman lose control and give into the pleasure. I almost enjoy it as much as they do.  \n\n\nI would suggest dumping the guy. I dont say that lightly either, but having one partner feel unsatisfied during sex does not bode well for a good long term relationship. Someone usually cheats and suffers severe depression. If you are truly a pretty woman then you would have no problems finding a decent man that fulfills you sexually. Life is a pain in the ass enough, theres no point in spending it with someone who doesnt satisfy your sexual needs.",

If not, then there is the explanation, why he isn't licking you. He doesn't care about your pleasure. \nOr he is shy about it.

In my opinion most reasons people have to avoid it can get resolved easily if you are a bit patient and communicate properly. \n\nThe most common three reasons I have found are \n\n1) They dont know how to do it or think they dont know how and are afraid to fail or embarrass themselves. If this is the case, be sure to be as informative as you can while they go down on you and let them know you are enjoying it. You dont need to attempt to exaggerate the pleasure and never try to fake an orgasm to \"make them feel better\". They need to learn what you enjoy and faking it wont help with that. \n\n2) They dont like the taste. This is either because they are sensitive to the experience or their partners body chemistry leads to a less desirable taste, or a combo of both. Eating healthier overall helps greatly and pineapple in particular helps with the taste of men and women. \n\n3) Sadly some men have this strange ego/macho mindset that I have never fully understood. Its rare but I have known a few guys that say they would never go down on a women because they think it would make them look/feel inferior to the women or they think the women enjoys an alpha guy being alpha like that somehow. I understand this mentality when its part of a domination fetish but in a normal relationship it makes absolutely no sense. The good news is that its probably not this one because you would probably see other red flags in a guy like this far in advance. \n\n\nAs for me, I have always enjoyed it but I personally absolutely fucking love going down on my wife. I am lucky and I think my wife tastes and smells fucking amazing. In past relationships I have had some less pleasant experiences in both taste and odor but even then it never bothered me very much. One thing that I think helps with my mentality is that I put a lot of focus in my partners pleasure over mine. If my wife just wants oral and no sex, 99 times in 100 I am more than happy oblige. Everyone is different and its possible that he can change whatever mindset he has but the main thing is that you need to communicate in order to fully understand what his aversion is and if it can be changed. \n\nAnd because I dont know when I will be able to legitimately say this in the future I cant miss this opportunity. I hope your boyfriend eats you out soon. ha. :)",

Another reason he might not do it is that he just doesn’t enjoy doing it or doesn’t think he’s good at it. If you haven’t already give him some female anatomy lessons and help him find the clit etc. But like I said earlier it’s also possible he just doesn’t like doing it and frankly I think that’s a boundary that should be respected. My gf has tried to give me head a couple times but it always hurts her jaw and she doesn’t like the feel of me in her mouth so I never really ask her to do it. It could be the same for him.

And what is considered a “normal” behavior in bed is very subjective. I’ll give you an example. There are lots of anecdotal stories about how “all men” want anal sex and how “all women” don’t even want to consider it. I personally really enjoy anal sex, but my husband doesn’t want to do it. That’s because the first time we tried anal, there was a teeny-tiny speck of poop on the end of his penis when we were done and that freaked him out! We’ve been married for 21 years now and I can count on 2 hands the number of times we’ve had anal. He will do it once in a blue moon for me because he knows I like it. But I don’t ask for it much because I know how uncomfortable it makes him. I just respect the fact that anal is one of those things he prefers not to do. He has his reasons, and it has nothing to do with me or my physical appearance.\n\nYour boyfriend maybe be embarrassed to tell you why he doesn’t want to perform oral sex. Maybe he just doesn’t have much experience and is afraid he will disappoint you. Or maybe it is a sensory thing and he just doesn’t like it. There are many reasons why he may not want to do that that don’t have anything to do with you. Don’t internalize *his* personal preference as *your* problem. Just relax and enjoy the other components of your relationship and have confidence in yourself that you are “enough”, right here right now.",

Most men know (or at least should) that women orgasm a lot easier from clitoral stimulation than they would from penetration. I always take care of my woman first. Not just because I feel I have to but because I want to. Part of the arousal for me is watching her enjoy herself. Not to mention I truly enjoy it. \n\nAdvice: stop giving him oral. See how he likes it (or doesn’t). Men will leave a relationship if they don’t get the kind of sex they want. Why should you be deprived while he gets what he wants? Sex, or relationships in general, should never be tit-for-tat. However, if you’re not getting what you want sexually, thus leaving you unfulfilled and feeling inadequate, why continue to go through that?",

En cambio, cuando notéis que la chica está a punto de alcanzar el climax, es preferible que os concentréis y optéis por una serie de movimientos idénticos y potentes que harán que ella disfrute y se deshaga de placer.\r\nSABES QUE LO ESTÁS HACIENDO BIEN CUANDO SUS PIERNAS EMPIEZAN A TEMBLAR…\r\nSin ninguna duda, esa es la forma en la que sabéis que estáis haciendo un cunnilingus como Dios manda (bueno a Dios no lo metamos en esto jajaja), mejor diremos un cunnilingus nivel experto.\r\nAsí es, cuando la chica está disfrutando, sus piernas tienen una serie de temblores que certifican que estamos en la senda correcta…\r\nEs entonces en este momento en el que podéis hacer que ese placer se....\nmultiplique, ¿Cómo…? Muy sencillo, introduciendo un dedito o un juguete en su vagina mientras seguís estimulando su clítoris con la lengua.\r\nY esto no es necesario, pero si no lo habéis probado nunca, os aconsejo que lo hagáis y notéis la reacción de su cuerpo, seguro que os sorprende y a ella todavía más…\r\nEl lenguaje corporal también nos dirá mucho sobre lo que ella está sintiendo…\r\n▪️Si aprieta tu cabeza fuerte contra su vagina, es porque necesita más presión y o movimientos con tu lengua más potentes.\r\n▪️Si se separa un poco de ti, es porque la presión es demasiado constante y siente molestia en el clítoris.\r\n▪️Si mueve sus caderas hacia arriba y abajo, quiere decir que necesita más velocidad en tus movimientos.\r\nEL SEXO ORAL ES COMO EL RESPETO, NO LO PIDAS SI NO ERES CAPAZ DE DARLO.😯\r\n_~/iunai\\~_ \r\nTips:\r\n1.-Chupa un cubito de hielo cuando vayas a hacerle oral\r\n2.-Si la cosa empieza a ponerse aburrida, juegos de rol, el poli y el prisionero nunca se pasa de moda\r\n3.-Si esta atada\ny vendada lo va a disfrutar mas, igual que tu\r\n4.-Hablale, tu voz les pone mas de lo que crees\r\n5.-El sexo suave esta bien, pero el sexo duro esta mucho mejor\r\n6.-El lubricante nunca esta de mas\r\n7.-Estate siempre atento a los gemidos, te pueden guiar mas de lo que crees, si la oyes gemir sigue haciendo lo que sea que cause esos gemidos\r\n8.-Toca los pechos con las manos, labios y lengua ( agujas del reloj, modo interruptor, variados...)\r\n9.-Preguntale que le apetece\r\n10.-A todo el mundo le gusta el sexo matinal,ahora hazlo pero bien echo.\r\nY siempre acabad abrazados despues del sexo, los mejores abrazos son desnudos.\r\nFIN.\n\nSorry for my bad spanish*",

Love giving it to her when she's sitting, on her back, on her knees, or even 69ing. It's honest to God one of my favorites parts and I love seeing her shiver in pleasure.\n\nHowever! Just like with men, if the girl doesn't clean down there, and I'm talking a baby wipe at the very least (full on soap and water with a washcloth is best) it can taste pretty bad (if she's not already dripping) due to stuff like dead skin, sweat, loose hairs, and other random stuff (lint and leftover toilet paper). That may be a pretty big factor to some....inexperienced guys. After, a lot of times we'll hear about how \"sweet that pussy is\" and it might be shocking your first time going down to have it taste bitter/sour (sweat and dead skin again).\n\nGuys(and gals), if this is you, keep going. As long as she's clean and healthy down there and, most importantly, you're doing a good job, once she gets going and the juices start flowing, pussy does in fact taste amazing!\n\nNow get out there and eat a (consenting) cookie!",

And guys absorb this when they watch porn. It might even increase their tolerance for domination, so they need to find even more hardcore porn.\n\nThere are also messages that you’re a bitch or a “bete male” if you eat your girl out, and real men only get their dicks sucked and fucked. Of course there are individual differences for every man, but there is a larger systemic issue going on here, and if you want to get really into it, you could say these messages extend beyond the bedroom and create a society where dominance and authority is respected more than compassion and kindness.",

            "text": "I enjoy giving oral than nearly anything else. Finishing in Mish with her arms around my neck and her legs locked behind me is the only comparison. \n\nThere is only 2 reasons that will make most guys avoid going down on a girl. The first is if a guy thinks she has had many sexual partners in the past. This only applies to some guys. If I don't trust that she is clean down there, I won't engage in any kind of sex with her, but some guys don't care about their penis but do about their mouth. Makes no sense.\n\nThe second reason, and the only thing that will make me not go down on a girl is if she has a smell coming from down there. Usually occurs due to a few things. If there is semen in there for a long time, a rotten smell can occur. Make sure to wash it out after sex. Second is a yeast infection. Third is a STD. Those are the main causes of smell eminating from down there considering someone is washing it in the shower daily. Although, if there is a smell, it is usually pungent and any kind of sex will be difficult if that is there. \n\nIt can be difficult for someone to know if a smell is present as they go nose blind to it. One time, I had a friend tell me I stunk and it was strange as I had just showered and wearing deodorant. Next day, I let myself be for an hour or two after I showered and noticed a rotten smell coming from my armpits. Went to the doctor and they connected it to a few red bumps I had on my chest. Said I had fungal foliculitis and prescribed me anti-fugals for a few weeks. Smell went away. Just an example to show that we can go nose blind to our own smells. Maybe ask him if there is a smell. \n\nIf none of that is the case and he is simply not reciprocating oral because he doesn't like it, he is selfish and you might be overlooking other selfish aspects of his personality outside of the bedroom. Sure, some guys may not like it but if you are giving him oral, whether you enjoy it or not, he should at least be trying. It is important to give as much as you get in a relationship. \n\nOne last note. Some guys, and I can speak from experience, may be self conscious about giving a girl oral because it is one of those things that is often noted as being difficult to be good at. It is rarely something that is a part of mainstream comedy and dirty jokes in TV/media compared to giving a guy oral which is commonly found in those arenas. The few times media mentions it, it is usually girls joking about it. For example, in one show, a girl said \"you know when a guy is going down on you and after a couple minutes you give him the head tap to say 'thanks for trying buddy'\". It was something that I have always been interested in but when I was younger, I admittedly knew nothing about how to do it properly or even in any way that wasn't bad for her. Your boyfriend may think that thrusting is a simple task and is avoiding being disappointed when he tries to go down on you. While oral on a guy is a relatively simple task... no teeth, eye contact, and you're already at least average at giving it. But oral on a woman can be a very complicated thing. Pleasure varies by the size of a woman's clit, whether she prefers simultaneous penetration, up and down or side to side. Length of time to orgasm. Etc. It is easy for even an experienced guy to go down and do his best then 20 minutes later, give up because she wasn't reacting the way other in the past may have. When in reality, she was 5 minutes away from having an orgasm. Sometimes it takes 5 minutes, other times it takes an hour. Whereas with a guy, it feels incredible the second it begins. \n\nNow, I doubt this is the case as few guys may be that concerned about their own abilities like that, but it is worth mentioning so you can bring that up as a possibility if you two discuss why he won't. In all honesty, some guys just want to get it over with. They get turned on really fast compared to women and can climax really quickly if they want to. So if his goal, as it is sadly the case for many guys, is to have an orgasm and that's all, he may just be a selfish lover like that. Ask yourself. Does he rub your clit during penetration? Does he kiss your neck? How long does he go on with foreplay? If he skips over these things too, there is a 99% chance he is just self interested when it comes to sex. \n\nYour best bet is to bring it uo with him and tell him of you are not satisfied with your sex life. Be warned though that as with any guy, they may get defensive as they may take it as an insult to their sexual ability rather than their attitude. If he reacts negatively to you even mentioning that, you may have more to think about in your relationship. Are there other aspects of your relationship that is a one way street? \n\nOne other thing you can try is to incentavize him to go down on you for a long time. If you are visibly enjoying it and letting him know how much you are loving it. With words and actions, going down on a girl can become addicting for a guy. After some practice, my first girlfriend finally had an orgasm from oral and she had her hand gripped in my hair and put me in a headlock with her things as she contracted and squirmed around. I looked up and her face was bright red and and her eyes rolled over. Then she looked at me and gave me the biggest smile and pulled me into her. Ever since then, I have been addicted know what I can do by going down on a girl. Many guys get addicted to it the same way. It is human nature. So if you can manage to get him to do it a few more times and he sees you in that much pleasure, it may change his mind and he may start to love doing it like many of us do.",

This isn't as popular of an idea as it used to be, but the idea that doing something that is all work and no stimulation on the man's end is seen as \"whipped\" or means giving control to your woman.  Clearly this is nonsense, but this is sort of a bro-culture thing that goes around.\n\n2) It's close to the butthole.  While yes, women tend to clean themselves, some of the more clean-freak guys worry about eating butthole germs.  \n\n3) Possible indirect homosexuality.  If you cum in the vagina, and then lick it, you are eating your own cum and that's super gay.\n\n4) Vaginas look horrifying up close if you aren't used to being that close to them.  Let's face it, genitals are an acquired taste.  If it wasn't for the strongest emotional responses to them triggering arousal, we'd see them as alien mushrooms or axe wounds that don't heal.  This can be overcome with exposure, but if you haven't eaten out women before, it can be a turn off as you adapt.\n\n5) That shit's intimidating.  Pounding your dick into a vagina is simple.  Foreplay is also pretty straight forward.  Eating pussy requires much more skill to get right.  Not saying this is true, but this is how some men view it.\n\n6) Too much work.  Many men just want a race to the finish.\n\nAs for why your man won't do it...only he knows the answer to that.  There are countless miscellaneous reasons, too.  Past trauma is a possibility.  Cultural indoctrination.  Maybe he just doesn't like the taste?  There are countless possible reasons.",

I am a guy who has a very sensitive nose so for me if we have been out (I don't drink) drinking & things start to go that way I am not going down on you unless you have had a shower when we get home. You didn't mention if this has been an issue with other partners or is it just with him.\n\n Everyone sweats we all have a certain amount of BO down there at the end of the day even after showering in the morning some people like this combination of smells & some of us don't.!! If she is going to give me head I will be taking a shower before that happens. & the fact that there is a lot of TP debris there as well after being in the bathroom a lot once the seal is broken. That old joke of what is that white stuff in women's underwear it's Clifty litter. Nope that's toilet paper is what that is. \n\nSo I am not saying that you have an smell or taste issue. But it could be that you might & he doesn't want to say anything because he doesn't want to hurt you or make you self conscious about a potential smell or taste issue. & it could have been that to his nose the very first time he did go down on you there was a smell or taste issue especially if this was a spur of the moment thing even after having had a shower earlier in the day. So something for all of us to keep in mind take a shower before sex. This is just my opinion. You could ask him if it is a BO smell or the way you taste to him. & try not to take it personally I know it is hard in these situations to not be hurt when something like this comes up in a relationship. \n\nSomething else to think about were you close to having your period that first time that he went down on you?. Someone I was with I could smell a change a few day's before hers started. I asked her if she was close to her cycle start date & the answer was yes why do you ask because you smell different is what I told her. But that isn't what ruined that relationship.",

And that's perfectly okay: no one should have to do anything during sex that they actively dislike. Sex is supposed to be about fun and pleasure and sharing a positive experience. So if he doesn't want to go down on you because he doesn't like to give oral sex in general, that's his prerogative. (And if that's a serious issue for you then, likewise, that's your prerogative.)\n\nIt should go without saying that you two should talk about this. It sounds like you're trying to do that but he's not reciprocating. *That's* the real problem here - he should at least be able to talk about why he doesn't want to do it, even if it's only to say he doesn't like it. What concerns me is that he won't even have that conversation and, more importantly, he won't therefore talk about other things you guys could do to make up for the fact that he doesn't want to do it. In other words, he doesn't seem very engaged in his part of making sex fun and pleasurable and positive for both of you, which imo is a much larger issue than just him not wanting to go down on you. It implies that there are issue in your relationship in general.",

It’s not directly connected to how you feel about someone, so I wouldn’t recommend using it as a baseline for determining how he feels. \n\nAt the same time I appreciate how it makes you feel. If it’s something you can talk about together, ask what’s putting him off or why he doesn’t like it in general, ask if he’s done it with other girlfriends and if so, why not with you. Ask him what he thinks about it overall. It’s very likely this is a him thing and not a you thing.\n\nIf you don’t get the answer you’d like or he can’t explain well enough, that’s fair enough, but I feel at the very least he does owe you some kind of explanation for your sake so maybe approach it in a light way where he can say what he needs to say.\n\nI hope it goes well.",

I'm the kind of guy who gags at bread in water (writing it practically made me vomit alone) and can't brush most of my tongue without gagging. I'm hyper-sensitive with it and so tonguing you can sometimes make me gag... apparently women would rather hit you and tell you you're wrong and that you made her feel bad than listen to your explanation so unless it's a serious partner I won't do it...it just avoids the issue.\n\nThe second thing is the smell/taste. Yes..I know....vaginas aren't supposed to smell like roses...I don't expect you to be. But of all of the women ive eaten out, about 1/4 of them don't have any sort of taste and I am obsessed with it. Some taste like weird-salty-expired-raw-chicken-esc-animal. Some just taste like moldy soy sauce. Some taste like what I imagine dumpster water to taste like.....it doesn't help I have a strong sense of smell either so I really just can't stand it. I know, ladies, that you can only wash so much. But it doesn't matter...it's happened with the freshly showered women too.\n\nFinally, that cream stuff...I have loved every second of when a woman is sat on my face and waterboarded me. But some girls produce this weird jelly??? And it's just a massive thing for me cuz it's a stronger scent, taste, texture..it hits all my physical alarms whether I want to or not. \n\nDon't force your man to go down on you just like he can't force you to go down on him. Find other things to do...plain and simple. If you can't live without him eating you out, or not understanding what his reason is without hitting him or crying about how it makes you feel, then y'all shouldn't be together. He probably has a reason and it's not you, so don't worry.\n\nI recommend playing with toys, getting good hand game, getting good dick game, foreplay, hell...eating ass is perfect imo cuz I don't have any of these issues (except the cleanliness thing lol) so fingering while eating booty has completely wiped the requirement of eating out.",

It wasn't something they enjoyed and it made the truly uncomfortable. And whenever someone told me that, they always immediately followed it up with the fact that they don't demand to receive oral either. They're perfectly fine with not receiving oral, and if it means not having to give it, they would willingly give up receiving. They only receive because their partner wants to, and it is enjoyable to receive. But sometimes there are just certain that are normal and okay for most that other people can't stomach, and oral id one of those things. If your boyfriend is okay with you not giving him oral anymore, then he's probably one of these people who simply doesn't derive a huge amount of sexual gratification from giving or receiving oral and is just uncomfortable with it generally speaking.",

            "text": "I feel oral sex is not only essential but also an integral part of our arsenal in bed. I love giving it. \n\nThis question is more layered, though. It would be easy to say that your boyfriend is selfish because he only cares about his pleasure. However, there may be other reasons at play: views on sex, understanding of sex, level of experience, emotional state, physical needs, connection, hygiene, etc. \n\nWe can be very selfish in bed. This is, in part, because we experience orgasm differently than women. If we were to graph it in a 2x2, a guy's orgasm would look like an inverted \"V\" (or as a pyramid). It shoots up at a steep angle and crashes down just as quickly as it went up. That is why guys usually want to take their pants off, hump-like dogs in heat, finish, and turn around to sleep. Women's orgasms are different. Women are more like an upside-down parabola. It takes a while to go up; when it is up, it lingers longer; and finally comes down gradually. If you were to put both graphs side-by-side, they would not align. \n\nIt is not enough to understand this. You also need to want to do something about it. Yes, it can be because you care about your partner, their desires, and their needs. But it does not have to be. For example, when I was a teen, I learned that most women do not climax on average. I figured they would be more likely to have sex with me again if I could make them orgasm. So, I started to think of oral sex not necessarily as foreplay or an alternative to sex but as an ally and essential tool on my arsenal to get laid. \n\nThen you are faced with a lack of experience. Girls, it can be intimidated. You start going down on someone, and they begin saying, \"not there, move a bit, not like that, what are you doing, just stop….\" Feelings of frustration, inadequacy, and plain anger come to mind. It is not like it comes with a manual. Friends aren't much help either (they are just as clueless as we are and more likely to give us poor advice). Porn isn't realistic (and should never be followed as sex-ed anyway). What helps is to have a partner that is open and communicates well what she wants/likes. If not, then it is just trial and error (I went that way). What you eventually learn is not only hearing the voice cues/commands but, most importantly, how the body reacts. Only then do you start getting comfortable, enjoying it, and having fun with it (or at least I did). \n\nThe best feeling, though, is that feeling of power. That feeling that you can get that done when most cannot. I love the shaking of the legs when tensing, ready to come. I love when my face is pushed in or pushed aside because they cannot take it anymore. I love the sweat all over and the kisses of satisfaction. Mostly, I love that feeling of power that comes from knowing that I am making her feel that way. \n\nAnd, by the way, there is nothing like penetrating after climaxing through oral sex. It bumps up her orgasm to a new level.  \n\nIt is not always comfortable, and sometimes it hurts, though. For example, if you go Brazilian and was a couple of days, the stubble can irritate the skin badly. A positional example is also when a girl sits on top of you. The pressure of the anterior labial commissure (the part above the clitoris) and the philtrum (the space between the mouth and the nose) combined with the movement can really hurt the lower face. But, then it is also one of those in which the view makes it worthwhile. \n\nThis whole thread reminds me of a quote in the movie Outside Providence, \"Sex is like Chinese dinner. It ain't over until you both get your cookies\". \n\nFinally, ladies, keep it clean down there. It does not have to smell like roses. It just does not have to smell.\n\nEdit: Spelling.",

Especially since giving a woman oral pleasure, can lead to a stimulating succession of orgasms.  Some men don’t know what they are doing down there.  Also, some women say that they can’t have an oral orgasm.  Which, can be more of a challenge to a guy than anything.  \n\nSo yeah, break it off with him.

Keep things neat and clean and in my experience, guys don’t really care what’s going on down there. \n\nAlso others guys thoughts on oral sex doesn’t mean anything to why your boyfriend doesn’t want to. Your man is allowed to just not be into it. If it’s something that this important to you you’re going to have to find a compromise with him, not people on the Internet, or accept that it’s just not in his boundaries which you need to respect.

She also wasn’t very good at expressing herself sexually so I always felt lost), but I know a lot of women don’t “love” giving oral, but do it because it’s something their partner receives great pleasure from. I’d recommend talking to him about it, being able to talk about sex things like this are important for a long healthy relationship (speaking as someone who’s been with my wife for 12 years), and maybe try something like 69. If he’s actively receiving pleasure at the same time it may help keep him involved. Plus it feels great having a girl moan on you during 69.\nHope it works out for you.

It can also be that she's really quiet in bed. If I can't tell I'm pleasing her then it makes the process much harder. I struggled with this more when I was young. I ended up feeling stupid and unappreciated.  \n\nSolution: I eventually figured out that I needed to talk to them. Encourage them to communicate a little more with me - which they usually did. I also learned that some women need more focus to reach orgasm than others and being vocal feels performative to them. It takes them out of their head. \n\n2. They have a more pungent aroma/taste. It sucks but some ladies just have a stronger smell/taste than others.  When I was younger, or even currently if I haven't had enough foreplay, this could get in the way of me enjoying giving oral. \n\nSolutions: Wash before sex. You can even incorporate it into foreplay by washing and touching each others bodies. Have more foreplay before getting to oral. \n\nMake sure the man doesn't orgasm before giving oral. Arousal powerfully depresses our disgust response. That's usually why horny people do weird shit that normally they find gross - like swap spit or pee on each other. \n\nI would try to talk to him more about this. Tell him it really matters to you and you want him to think about why he doesn't want to do it. Make sure he takes about a day and tell him you want him to be honest. If he thinks it's gross that's okay. If he thinks you're a little smelly that's okay. \n\nYou're going to have to be willing to potentially take a hit to your ego so you can get a honest answer out of him. Once you have that honesty you can work at a solution.  \n\nIf it ends up he's a little lazy in the bedroom you can work on that too. He can supplement his tongue with buzzy toys etc. \n\nIf he really just won't do it no matter how much you try. Well. Maybe new partner time. At least for me sex is too important to not have an enthusiastic partner who likes to play as much as I do.",

A few times was because of personal hygeine like drunken sex and they had used the bathroom a few times so it tasted it smelled like urine but the other issue was something else. I was with this partner for a little over a year and tried multiple times to give her oral but could not do it. Her vagina had a strange taste and actually burned the back of my throat. It was NOT a hygeine issue and we actively talked about this and showered together. It was like the pH of her vagina was abnormal or something. It was a stinging almost sour taste. Oddly enough she had gynecological issues. She had cervical dysplasia and went through an operation to remove the cells but it had no effect on her vaginal off-ness. Maybe it wasn't just her though but \"us\". Perhaps our major histocompatibility index was not agreeable and none of her other partners had the same issue.

Hairy, close-cropped or clean shaven, if a guy is into it he’s into it. Your pubic hair traps pheromones that get your lover more in the mood while they’re down there performing oral sex so don’t shave or wax it all off. \n\nAs far as your bf, he may have some deep seated issues with it, may have had an ex who forced him to do it, may have been criticized too harshly by an ex for not being good enough at it, or may just not be into it. My wife is more into giving than receiving, which - believe it or not - sucks for me because I enjoy giving. At any rate, if he doesn’t like it then it’s just one of those compromises you may want to make.

Refer to reason #2 for further explanation.\n\nAnd it's more satisfying and does not cause post nut clarity in the negative form or post nut brain fog.\n\nSpecifically giving oral, it really isn't all that enjoyable and I would actively avoid doing it if it had no other context or effects.  Like imagine how enjoyable it would be to like your arm or rub oil or urine on your arm and then lick it off.  Not very fun is it.\n\nBut because of the fact that their is in fact a woman that I love attached to the genitals I'm licking and sucking on it Is extremely enjoyable and satisfying because I know that she is enjoying it.

The reason might just be \"I don't like it, not for any particular reason, I just don't\"  and that's OK, no one should feel pressured to do anything they don't want to sexually.

It might be some kind of puritanical or repressive beliefs or ideas he had put on him growing up that he needs help working past.\n\nAnd lastly it's not all that stupid to break up over this, try to avoid it, but if it's something that you really want in your sex life you shouldn't deprive yourself of that, sex isn't shallow it's a deep, integral, and intimate part of a relationship and lacking some aspects can very genuinely cause issues short and long term.",

HPV is responsible for the rapid increase in Cervical Cancer in women and in Head and Neck Cancers in both men and women. If diagnosed early enough Head and Neck Cancers are very treatable with a combination of Chemotherapy and Radiation. (Think Michael Douglas cancer). However, you really don't want to have to endure the treatment. It is arduous and leaves you with a compromised ability to eat, it changes your tastebuds so everything tastes different and leads to dental complications.\nSurgery may also be required to remove recurrent cancers and or to remove (or partially remove) the tongue, jaw, lymph nodes and or parts of the skull.\nAwareness can protect you.\n1. Be cautious of changes in your oral health, your swallow or general discomfort in your head and neck.\n2 if you have prepubescent children (both genders) speak to your health professional regarding vaccination against HPV. if everyone was vaccinated it would save a lot of people having to go through awful painful treatment and possible death from a simple viral infection.\nI am a HNC HPV + sufferer.",

Some tips I would give you- Make sure you are clean down there!! And make sure after you wash to thoroughly clean the soap off (tasting soap sucks!). If it’s clean then it tastes like... sweet water and there is almost 0 smell (other than... idk how to explain it... a smell of sex/pheromone? It’s a good smell when clean). \n\nYou’ve been dating for 3 years... at this stage of the relationship you absolutely should be able to have an honest conversation about this. Tell him that you REALLY want him to do it and want to know the specific reason why he doesn’t want to. Don’t let him off the hook with a non-answer. Make absolutely sure you’re 100% clean down there... there shouldn’t be much... IF ANY taste or smell at all. If there is a fishy smell and/or taste then you’re either not correctly giving it a full clean or there is some sort of imbalance and you should 100% talk to your doctor/gynecologist. If you’re 100% clean with no smell/taste down there and he is grossed out by the taste, try not to be mad... some people are grossed out by things for no good reason. If that’s the case then go get some flavored lube. Go to your local sex store and take him with you and have him try out the flavors of different lubes (most places I’ve been to let you sample them). If he refuses to do any of this, or refuses to give you an answer to why, then you should really put your foot down and tell him that you want to enjoy oral sex just like he does and you deserve to be able to enjoy it too. If none of this works, then idk what to tell you. He absolutely should reciprocate oral since you do it for him. Making sure it’s clean and offering him a solution with flavored lube should absolutely be enough to have him do it. It’s also possible that he doesn’t know how to do it or what to do down there and is embarrassed. If that’s the case then TEACH HIM! He absolutely shouldn’t be embarrassed here.... I literally ask every girl I have sex with what they like when I’m going down on them (soft, hard, fast, slow, tip of the tongue, my whole tongue on your clit kind of like licking a sucker, sucking and licking the labia, putting my tongue inside your vagina, or all of it combined).",

If you have a safe relationship and you are being 100% clear when expressing your wishes and he is not forthcoming then conversation must change from “I need this/i like this” to “by you not doing this that I ask you to, you are bringing feelings of insecurity and inferiority in myself, and you make me feel insufficient,” and go from there. I might also just be that he does not like it. In this case his must tell you clearly in order for you to understand it. Some people just dislike certain things, and that’s completely fine. But on the other hand, he must lear to express himself correctly and clearly to you.\n\nAlso, maybe keep in the back of your mind that he might just not yet be sufficiently emotionally developed to know how to deal with an emotional relationship. I certainly wasn’t in my first tries and I fucked up big time because I wasn’t really thinking of the other person, instead I focused on what gave me pleasure (not necessarily sexual in this case but point remains anyway).\nSo yeah.
