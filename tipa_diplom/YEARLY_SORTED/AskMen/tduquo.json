I was too busy making sure she enjoyed it to fully enjoy it myself, therefore not needing to cum)\n-I’d only allow myself to cum when I was ready (going faster and deeper than before for full pleasure)\n\nI left that girl and got with someone who shared my interest in BDSM. After that girl, I was single for a few months and slept around. It got to the point where I’d have to let them cum twice before I cum once.

Other people have already said some insightful things and given some great tips so I don’t want to rehash all that but there are a few things I just want to jump on from like a sexual health expert perspective though that might just help kind of normalize your experience. \n\nThe first one is that porn isn’t real and this idea that (cis)men are supposed to last 30-45 minutes (or even 10 minutes) of continual pumping at a time really isn’t really accurate to most peoples experience. The average time for penis in vagina (PIV) sex is reported to be around 3-4 minutes but we also know that when left to self reporting people tend to exaggerate their sexual performance so… long story short like 30 seconds to a few minutes is totally normal and if that’s you there is nothing wrong with you. If you’re a gbMsM I am sorry I don’t know what the times are for that but I am SURE it’s much much shorter than you think it is. Mainly what I’m getting at here is that what you think of as “premature” is likely just normal biology. That’s not say you can’t work towards longer times if you want the PIV part of sex to last longer, but you may not actually be cumming prematurely at all.\n\nWhich brings me to point number 2- there is SO MUCH MORE to sex than penetration. Especially if your partners are ladies (again, sorry if you’re a gbMSM, I’m not part of that community so maybe someone else can sound off on that). I’m gunna let you in on a not-so-secret secret; the penetration part does basically nothing for the vast majority of women. We really don’t care if it last 30 seconds because for 75% of women PIV is not how we get off. Like, it’s part of sex for women, but it’s not *sex*. If your partners are women and you are worried about “premature” ejacuation, the best advice I can give you is to spend the vast majority of your time with “foreplay” because that’s where the real fun happens for them, and then when you’re ready to shoot your lady won’t care how quick you cum because she already came during all the non-penetrative sex you just had. And because that can be way less focused on YOU it can go on for a while without you feeling over stimulated.\n\nIn summary\n1) you’re probably not actually premature, toxic masculinity has just really put some pretty biologically impossible standards on men and their sexuality \n2) in addition to all the other suggestions that have been made, non-penetrative sex could be a win-win for both you and your partner if you want your sessions to be longer",

But when I’m able to, I disassociate and just kinda look at her, and the face she’s making, look at the room, look out the window (it’s over our bed) and kind of just do the motions if that makes sense. It’s almost like I zone out and I could be doing any motion at all. After which I could really go for hours, but orgasms are just okay if I do it. \n\nId like to try some different methods like reverse keigles or something (I hear you can hold back the waters if you flex it right) but like I said, sexual encounters are unfortunately fewer and farther between these days.",

Here are some things I've noticed,  about myself:\n\n- it's mostly mental\n- if I'm focused solely on how good it feels, it'll likely end up lasting a short time\n- I pause as soon as I enter. Take a few breaths. When I feel the \"shock\" (of how good it feels) wears off, then I'll continue. \n- repetition is key. If it's been a while, then I won't last long. The more frequently I do it, the longer I tend to last. \n\nI've had a couple relationships before, that we've had lots of sex. As the relationship goes on, I notice that I tend to need sex less, and therefore last longer. Even when my partner tended to intice me more (walking around naked, or with provocative clothing on, etc), I tended to want sex more frequently, but not physically need it. It wasn't a detriment to the level of intimacy I felt (was actually beneficial to it). But, it just made me last longer. \n\nThere are also pills that help with that. \n\nBut the biggest issue is just time. Trying methods, like kama sutra, will greatly help. Start slow, then speed up, back off when close. Then, only go all the way when you're ready. An attentive and caring partner is crucial though. If it's their way or no way, then it's probably best to move on.",

If I don't have sex every two weeks or so, it doesn't matter if I relieve myself, sex will make me cum fast (or used to).\n\nUnderstanding your patterns, learning to cool down, using less stimulant positions are all good.\n\nWhat also works is just blocking the ejaculation by squeezing the base of the shaft  rightly as you're about to cum. This pretty much ruins 50% of your own orgasm, but allows you to keep going afterwards. Tho for me all feeling of sex also dissapates, you are able to satisfy her which might sometimes me worth it.\n\nGetting older (30+) also helps. But probably most was going on SSRIs for depression. It can fuck with your libido, but for me a positive side effect was a pretty nicely balanced sex to cum ratio.\n\nI doubt I'd take it for that reason alone, but if you're really suffering that might be something you can talk to your GP about.

            "text": "Drugs.\n\nI was a two pump chump. Initially couldn't even get it in without cumming. Sex was all in my head, I wasn't ever in the moment. Felt like it was all I'd thought about for years. That's not good, it fucks you up. Porn made it worse.\n\nI knew that it was mostly psychological (I say mostly, I definitely have a very sensitive dick which complicates things), the sound of my partner cumming or even nearing orgasm would tip me over the edge; I also knew that once I'd managed to get through that point I'd be ok from then on. So I tried a few different drugs, initially from a business that specialised in treating sexual disorders with medications. Tried injectables that kept me hard after cumming, didn't work. Then tried what I later found was an antidepressant, better results. Slowed down my response. Read about off-label use of tramadol for treating PE, asked my local doc for a prescription explaining what it was for and he obliged. Not only did it slow down my response but it relaxed me lots, the stress of performance anxiety was just about gone, and at last I was able to keep going through my partner's orgasm... and on to six or seven more! I can't tell you what a boost that was to my self confidence. I think most PE is down to self confidence.\n\nThere's more to it than just drugs though. I had to get used to just how intense the sensations from sliding in and out can be without cumming. Turns out it can be way, way more intense than from masturbation. I also find that making noise is an outlet, kind of like releasing pressure. I'm very noisy now and it really helps me cope with the sensations (and enjoy them!) and keep going.\nI also find that coming super close to orgasm and stopping or pulling out means that I can go maybe 5 minutes longer when I resume, before having to rest again. It sometimes gets so intense that I will have a dry orgasm, feels like a body orgasm but without ejaculation. When I'm in the zone like this I just basically refuse to come! I can have total control over it. This doesn't happen every time though.\n\nOh and also weed. Weed is amazing, it intensifies every sensation and delays orgasm. It's a slower build. I recommend it.\n\nProviso: some people find tramadol very addictive. I only had to use it maybe two or three times to have the desired effect and haven't used it since except once for pain management. If you choose to try it, be very careful and use it wisely. I wouldn't use it purely for entertainment.",

Sometimes I like to go spelunking for a few minutes just to tease, but you can’t go fast. If I ever felt I was about to lose it, I’d stop what I was doing and do something else. Once she has had her maximum amount of fun, it was my turn, and that always was super quick.

As well as if you focus so much on not cumming you do the opposite. But it is easier said than done. All I want to tell you is to not be afraid of trying and keep going. After some time you should start to think less about prematuring. In those times when I cummed in less than 2 or maybe 1 minute I would tell my gf that she is so hot + i was so horny that I could not do anything than cum after feeling how wet she was.
