            "text": "This isn‚Äôt what was said but rather what went unsaid.  It‚Äôs not so weird but something a lot of men experience that needs to be discussed.\n\nI had been dating my ex for about two years.  It had been rocky at times and this usually coincided during times where I was feeling vulnerable.  I picked up on the pattern that whenever I brought up my feelings I would get the cold shoulder big time.  All communication was cut off from me for up to weeks at a time.  In retrospect, big red flags.  I assumed at the time I had messed up somehow, let things be, and moved on with my life.  She would eventually ‚Äúmiss me‚Äù and start communicating again.  We never discussed my feelings usually because I had dealt with them by this time.\n\nMarch 2020 rolls around and I was sick with a cough that wouldn‚Äôt go away, extreme fatigue, difficulty with climbing stairs,and I was really depressed. It was probably Covid.  Anyway, I told her how I was feeling and I felt like I was basically worthless.  I told her how I was finding it really difficult to be what she needed from me.  She took this as I was breaking up with her.  She stopped responding to me.\n\nLockdowns started and I was completely isolated.  No communication with my ex.  So, I coped by trying to move on and deal with my depression.  By June I was feeling pretty recovered.  I had been doing a lot of self work and learning about what it meant to express emotions and vulnerability in a relationship.  All healthy things and what builds strong relationships.\n\nIt was around that time my ex contacted me.  We resolved some things and agreed that we needed to communicate and discuss our feelings.  Things were good for a time until we had a dispute over Covid related stuff.  I had visited my family where I was distancing from them and stayed outside.  My sister had her kids back in daycare and that worried me a bit.  I was invited to see my ex and her kids at her place the same day after visiting with my family.\n\nI told her I was feeling uneasy about being around people.  I was feeling remorse for not being able to be close to my niece and nephew since they were in daycare.  I was worried that I could expose her and her kids especially since I was working in a school setting too.  I was feeling isolated and not great.\n\nThis turned into, ‚ÄúHow dare I not tell her in advance that my niece and nephew were in daycare, how dare I put her and her kids at risk!‚Äù  I said she knew I was going to see them, I was social distancing, wearing a mask, and it was the same day.  There was virtually no way I could have passed on an infection.  She accused me of withholding information, that it wasn‚Äôt my choice to make, and stopped talking to me.  I was really confused about all of this.\n\nI eventually convinced her to meet up with me on the 4th of July, just her and I.  She made it pretty clear when we met up that she was pretty ambivalent about my presence there.  It seemed like she was content to ignore me.  Eventually I told her this wasn‚Äôt good for me.  I needed to talk.  I needed the emotional intimacy of her being present with my feelings.  I laid everything on the table, I was practically in tears telling her about my feelings and how difficult it was coping with not feeling free to express my vulnerabilities.  I told her how much of a struggle it had been coping with everything on my own.\n\nAnd this is where I get to the point (tl;dr).  She literally said nothing and stared at me with contempt while I bared my soul.  I said my peace without acknowledgment.  There was nothing left to do but walk out the door.  I could see in her eyes that she saw me as less than a man.  Without saying a word she communicated that I wasn‚Äôt a man to her.\n\nFellas, this is farthest from the truth: it takes a real man to have the courage to be honest with your feelings.  It‚Äôs a mark of a man to and accept your emotions as valid.",

The argument was:\n\nHer (Emily) and her sister (Taylor) would constantly call me while I was either working or trying to relax. She'd call up and say stupid stuff like \"your dad has a mangina.\" With various adjectives of the word. (If you're reading this, Em, I'll spare you the 10 minute Google search to find the definition of the word. It's a word/phrase that describes a noun.)  And that would really tick me off, so one day she just started going off: \"Your dad has a smelly mangina, a big fat hair stinky mangina.\" And I told her to stop but she kept going. Not once did I ever mention how her dad looked like a famous chef that originated from Flavortown, but I digress.\n\nSide note: My dad is a hard working autobody tech pushing 60 at the time of this post. He would give his shirt off of his back if it meant that mom and I could have a good life. He spends time with us, he goes on trips with us, he works on my vehicles and my friends vehicles no questions asked. He has a hard time expressing his feelings out of embarassment, he'll tell mom \"Love you\" in a hushed tone in about 0.5 seconds. He's a really good man, and I love him dearly.\n\nI had to raise my voice so she'd stop. I can't remember what I said, something like \"If you don't knock it off I'm done with you.\" She yelled at me and cursed me to bits: \"You stupid motherfucker, I hope your dad dies because his mangina is too stinky.\" Then she'd go back to giggling. No, this is not a troll post. This is exactly how she would talk, despite being over the age of 18. So, I cut it off. I told her to have a nice life and dumped her. I get a call from her sister who tells me \"I'm glad you dumped her, because now my sister can get a REAL man who doesn't sit and bitch all the time and can actually have fun.\" \n\nMy dumbass got back together with her a second time in 2018, and we broke up for good in 2020.\n\nI'm engaged now since the end of 2021 and I couldn't be happier.

I went to a week long mindfulness retreat and training to be able to do mindfulness based stress reduction with groups, a really cool intervention that I had been involved with and completed a lot of research on in both my masters and doctorate. I made it to the retreat earlier than many others and found myself trying to say hello and engage new participants as they arrived.\n\nA group of older, maybe 50's ish women arrived, I think I was about 38 at the time, and when I started talking to them they tried to give me their bags and tell me where to take them. So I told them I didn't work here and that I was here for the retreat. They looked at me like a was crazy and said, no really, can you help us with our bags. So I said I was happy to help them but I didn't work there and was there for the retreat. So then they looked befuddled and said they never imagined that a man would come to a retreat like this and they were not sure how they felt about that and they were going to go talk to the people putting on the retreat.\n\nSo after that I kind of felt like a second class participant and didn't engage almost anyone the whole week. Almost to the point where the staff came and talked to me about my lack of participation as the week went on. There were of course other men there, I think there were maybe 5 or 6 of us out of a group of under 30, but it didn't really change that initial encounter. Thankfully the retreat was one on mindfulness and involved a lot of days and hours of not talking to others and being engaged in mindfully practice. That even sits with me often...",

During my freshman year of college I was put into a group for a class with three girls. We became good friends over the course of the class and stayed friends afterwards. I'm far from a confident guy to begin with and while I was close friends with one of the group I never had the courage to ask her out.\n\nThey all lived in the same dorm and on the same floor which had something akin to floor group dates where the whole floor would bring someone along and they'd go out doing things. In my Sophomore year my close friend invited me to be her plus-one and during the event we took a group picture of us four as we were all together. It was a good time and nice to spend time off campus with my friends.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and I get tagged in the picture on Facebook so I share it. Not an hour later at least four people I knew from years past asked if I was gay because I wasn't dating any of the girls in the picture. They also said they'd assumed I was their \"gay best friend\" and that they'd always assumed I was gay since I never dated anyone in high school. I never knew people thought that of me before then, and for clarity I'm not gay or bisexual but that always stuck with me that people thought I was because I was too self conscious to ask anyone out.\n\nEdited for grammar",

So this idea of a weak minded insecure woman pretending to be feminist was a very hard thing for me to comprehend.\n\nAfter many years and retrospection I suspect that was subconsciously probably the motivation for her telling me that story out of the blue.  She probably thought I was too nice of a guy (and probably good looking) to just break up with, so I suspect that explains why the arguments over nothing grew and grew until she laid down that crazy story that shook me to my very core.\n\nI am very non-combative and while I love debating things it is rare that I ever really care about another's opinions.  And thinking of individuals as being anything other than individuals has been well beyond my abilities.  So when she laid that story on me and pretended like she expected that a person could agree with that logic it totally tore at my ability to comprehend reality.  I was frankly in shock.

I did was calm and collected...  which made her more emotional..  but I'm patient so I waited it out so I could finish communicating my thoughts, go home and theoretically never see her again..\nalthough I did end up seeing her a couple years later while on another date with another woman at a restaurant where I saw her with some poor sap who probably didn't know what he was getting into yet.",

One of them that I'll call M told me 'You're lucky you don't have to do a girl's hair and how I wouldn't be able too because so difficult.

I told her when I was in my 20's (now late 40's) I had to look after my younger cousin at the time because her parents were going through a rough spot. I had taken her in and to make her happy, I would do her hair in the mornings.

Not in a sexual kind of preference, just they look nice. Maybe my sister got me brainwashed back in the days when we played with her Barbie stuff?

Oddly, I have been a better cook and more neat (in terms of organizing and house cleaning) than anyone I've dated. Because  I have heavy OCD even while medicated, and because I love food, but am a cheapskate, so I learned how to cook myself so I could enjoy good food without paying restaurant prices...Luckily, all the women I have been with appreciated that fact. \n\nI think the only reason I manage to escape women like this is because I tend to only get interested after knowing them fairly well. I become disinterested/unattracted to a person very quickly if their personality is shit. Lol.\n\nThankfully, all the women I've been with have encouraged me cook for them, share my feelings (which, I am still uncomfortable with, and rarely do, just tough, I grew up that way), etc. None have called me less than a man for any of these traits. \n\nJust like I wouldn't call them any less of a woman if they had masculine traits. \n\nI have definitely managed to avoid the closed minded women. It may be because of my tattoos and piercings... It seems they attract very open minded women. I'm not sure if that is the full reason though. \n\nEither way I've gotten lucky lol",

We used to hang out at one of the girls' house watching movies, playing Halo, and on occasion having little duels with bamboo swords she had. Well that girl, at like 15 or 16, got a boyfriend in his early 20s. Like you'd probably guess, dude was a mess. He would throw big fits when he lost at Halo, like chuck a stool at the wall mad. I did not help because nine times out of ten i was the one who killed him in-game and when he would blame he contoller/lag/whatever, I would remind him that it's not the controller/lag/whatever, he just sucks and i knew this because I kept killing him and I sucked. I can't stress enough that i was like 14 and very confident in my ability to handle myself in a fight, so I was only poking the bear because I was sure I could take him if he got too rowdy. I stopped after he threw the stool (in his gf's house. Chipped the corner of a wall. Yikes!). I also had no idea he was at least verbally and emotionally abusive to my friend. I wouldn't have riled him up if i had thought he was going to take it out on her. More likely, being an impulsive kid, I would've just started a fight myself instead of trying to get him to start one.\n\n\nOnto the meat. We had a fight with the bamboo swords in her lawn, for fun. He was a weeb who thought he was born talented or something, he lost. Repeatedly and badly. I should note no one had any training or anything, we were just kids hitting each other with sticks. By the end of the night, he was near in tears crying to his gf, my friend, \"How can i protect you if I can't even win?\" It was by some miracle no one laughed in his face, but she had to stifle laughter when we were talking about it later.\n\n\nAnyway they later broke up after it became clear to her he was a jackass and i think he fucked off to Texas and married some teenager he met online.\n\nEdit:\nTldr: High school friend's innapropriately older bf threw a baby fit and insisted he was no kind of man if he couldn't win a toy sword duel one on one against some teens.",
