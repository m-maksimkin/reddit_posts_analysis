Then I have to take them out and try again lol.\n\nAt its worst, I’d full on throw up if I could feel or taste the pills and start choking. They’d have to be buried in food like I would to give my dog his meds for me to not trigger the reflex :/\n\nWithout any food to chew first, my brain thinks I’m choking on some solid object that’s not meant to be eaten- like an M&M or skittle doing down the wrong pipe. But literally chewing a bird sized bite of rice or a cracker the second beforehand, then tossing the pills in before I swallow the food- even if they have more volume than the actual food- stops that choking reaction I get. Idk why that is, but it’s weird. And like I said, the worst of it disappeared on its own as I got older. It was just really bad as a kid, probably because I did accidentally choke on some candy as a kid or something.

Like a lot. Learn early to protect your interests.\n\nHard work and determination certainly matters, but sometimes you just plain lose... and for the shittiest reasons. Learn to shrug it off and try again.\n\nMy best advice is to do 2 things- first, be the guy you'd want to be best friends with. Support yourself and be kind to yourself. Secondly, develop a skill that very few others have, because that's really the best way to make a lucrative living these days. You don't even have to have any particular passion for your skill, just something you're naturally very good at and don't hate doing. It's a shameless plug, but skilled trades are a great way to make a living. Welders, plumbers, carpenters, electricians, instrument technicians (like me), mechanics all make better incomes than one would assume. \n\nLife is tough. Ditch the rose-colored sunglasses right now and dig in and work *hard* at whatever you choose to do. There's no skating through, but working hard and delivering a quality product will always pay. \n\nThe \"Jetsons\" dream is just that- a dream. It'll never be real. There is no such thing as just showing up and going through the motions and then expecting to earn a salary that will put you in the lap of luxury. Buckle up, buttercup, it's a very difficult and frequently cruel ride. But you can do it.\n\nI know my tone is pretty pessimistic, but I'm just being real. I strive every day to be kind and honest, and to be the master of my domain. It's a tough gig, but it's what makes me happy. My wife loves me, and my kids are the light of my life.

Always took it as a lesson to heart that fits the question so I thought I’d share it but with non-essentials left out. \n\nA woman was brutally raped and beaten by a man who got away with it for almost a decade. Years down the line, the woman, now in college, feels comfortable enough to share the story with her boyfriend. Dude is obviously horrified but takes it silently then decides to visit the town where she came from without telling anybody, packing nothing but spare underwear and a baseball bat. \n\nNow, the town was small and everyone knew everyone including who the rapist was and what he did. Turns out, everyone knew who the boyfriend was too and who he was dating at the time. The boyfriend waits for the rapist in a very public area and starts beating him with his flimsy baseball bat. When the bat broke, he started using his hands. \n\nNo one batted an eye. They just carried on with their day. Boyfriend goes back to college and pretends nothing happened. The woman tried asking him about where he went but the man just says he was out the week studying for some class. To this day, even with his kids asking him about that event or where he was during that date (man and woman ended up getting married), he maintains the story that he was just studying. \n\nAnyway, there’s going to be moments in life that’ll remind you that karma just doesn’t exist. Sometimes, you gotta make it exist. If that dude never went back to that town and gave that rapist the beating of a lifetime, he would have carried on with life as if nothing happened. Obviously, you can’t go around acting like you’re frank castle, but you gotta have the wisdom to know when to act too.",

Claiming you're a \"Nice guy\" while verbally attacking women after being rejected just makes you look like douche. Having basic common courtesy doesn't make you a \"Nice guy\" because that's expected from everyone. Having compassion, being empathetic, patient, self aware, and being able to befriend women without looking at them as objects for you to aquire and have sex with is 100000px better than being \"nice\"\n\nBlaming your dating problems on women who reject you or \"FDS\" will turn off almost any woman who isn't equally garbage. Stop blaming women you've never met for rejecting you. Also, working out and being clean isn't a personality trait. Stop acting like a victim because someone doesn't like you as a person and Stop blaming it on Chad's or claiming women like to be abused or want assholes. Many women have completely different personalities with different likes and wants and desires and life experiences. Stop trying to stuff them into one category when you don't get what you want. Stop playing victim and pretending a few women you saw on the internet who say most of the dudes they meet are scummy losers, you don't have to know them. Many women know exactly what they want and if it's not you, move on. Stop begging them to tell you what you did wrong. Stop being mad if a woman who dealt with dozens of guys blowing up and being aggressive decides she'd rather just stop talking altogether than break down some detailed explanation. She doesn't owe you one. \n\nAlso, Stop thinking every woman wants you to hold the door for them and pay for their meals and buy them gifts. Just because you saw it in movies doesn't mean it's real. Also, those YouTube \"bad boy\" pickup artists are absolutely garbage and none of their opinions hold any real weight and I can promise you their love lives are generally terrible.",

Clothes, gadgets, heels/shoes, furniture, cars... \n\nOr the disproportionate effort we've put into protecting some endangered species way more than others, simply because \"they're cute/pretty\", like pandas or snow leopards.\n\nHumans perceive much more information through sight compared to the other senses, so we are instinctually more attracted to things we find visually appealing. That's not to say that personality or compatibility don't matter. But they come second to looks, which \"gets your foot in the door\" and remains a deciding factor in the background, even if it's only operating at a subconscious level.\n\nWhy do I think women are more prone to this is anecdotal, I'll admit. But it has nothing to do with dating or relationships. Rather, it's because I've noticed women are a lot more prone to pick a thing over another because it's more visually appealing, even if it's very impractical. Not saying men don't do this, just that they do it less often. \n\nHeels are a prime example. I have never  heard a man say \"yeah, these shoes make my feet bleed, but look at them! stylish AF!\"",

People pleasing and being nice gets you nowhere since you're not pleasing yourself or being nice to yourself. Nobody deserves to be patronized for things.

By early access, I literally mean a very large group of people playing alpha and beta before a full release. This will deter a massive amount of the backlash companies have been receiving if they went this route.",

            "text": "Life is pain. Overcoming that pain and growing as a person is what life is about. \nCould be physical pain (trust me, it happens, nobody’s immune from crippling chronic pain from happening. It will come, sometimes from disease, sometimes from bad habits, sometimes from injuries or infections, sometimes from worse). \nCould be emotional pain (trust me, it sucks to realize how much of a jackass you were to the people you love and how much you buried your mental health in the sand of your daily life because you were scared to face it. The more your head is screwed up, the harder it gets to straighten it back out again, and the harder it gets to even think about it). \nCould be moral (trust me, the cruel reality is that we all start out selfish, depraved and awful. Once we grow up and are no longer innocent, it is the hardest thing in the world to turn your awful, depraved and selfish ass into a generous, balanced and decent person; more important is to sort out WHY you want to make those changes in the first place, because staying blind to your own motivations is a recipe for destruction instead of growth). \n\nFace that pain, and overcome it. Face that physical pain and get it treated, get the cause sorted out as best you are able. Face that mental pain, and balance those brain chemicals so you can think clearly for the first time in your life. Face that moral pain, so that you can decide for yourself what kind of person you are right now, what you want to be instead of who you are right now, and why you want to make the changes to become that ideal version of you. \n\nIt will take you decades to overcome just ONE of these pains. If you don’t get started now, you won’t have the physical strength, the mental resilience, or the moral certainty, to live your life the way you want to live it. You must work on all of these in parallel. How? The key is below. \n\nGet started with each one. If you’re sleeping on these pains, wake up. If you’re awake to these pains, sit up from your bed. If you’re sitting up, get up out of bed. If you’re out of bed, stand up. If you’re standing up, start walking through your plans for life. If you’re walking through your plans, start jogging through them. If you’re jogging, start sprinting. If you’re sprinting, sprint faster. \n\nThis little by little, bit by bit and systemic and disciplined approach is the only way to break that thousand-mile journey into a massive chain of steps. Only way to do it is one foot after the other, one step at a time. \n\nWhen each pain is broken down into these manageable steps, you can arrange your life to do at least one of the steps for each pain every day. That way, you get working on each pain and start making progress towards overcoming these pains. \n\nTake your bitter pills every day; it’s one day closer to finishing the medicinal course of life. Once you’re at the end and you see the good you have done, how far you got and how you left a positive impression on the world, then you can finish your journey and move on in peace, and lay the journey for the next generation at their feet as you pass on. \n\nGood luck, my dudes. And safe journeying.",

There are mental health conditions that will impact this. You can't simply overrule that by choice and there is a limit to what you will be able to overcome through willpower. I don't ever want to minimize how this can impact your emotional wellbeing.\n\nBut everyone can and should reframe how we react to the world around us. Nobody can MAKE us feel something. How we feel is a response, a reaction, to the actions of others. This is so fucking hard to understand at first, because we want to say, \"So-and-so really pissed me off!\" This is ingrained in how we communicate, and how we perceive our emotions. \n\nBut if we re-state it, \"So-and-so did this. I am angry about that.\" Now we can see that that person controls their actions, and we control our actions. We can begin to take ownership of how we feel. When we own our reactions, our actions to resolve those feelings are more clearly seen.\n\nFinal note, this goes for both positive and negative emotions. The source of our happiness is inside, so if the seeming external source changes, we can control the negative result. \"I was happy in this relationship. I am sad that it is over.\"",

If your mom is an actor, it's easy to get your first acting job. If your uncle works in publishing, your first book is guaranteed a publishing deal.\n\n2- Corporations, filmmakers, games developers etc. may care about diversity, but they'll still default to \"sexy\" diversity. Take the queer community. There may be more queer male characters but they're usually set dressing, background characters, or have the default \"sassy gay friend\" or \"homophobic closet case\" attitude. It took three Mass Effect games and four queer romance options for a female character before they gave guys the option to have a same sex relationship, and I don't think I've ever seen a canonically queer male lead in a mainstream video game I've played, at least not one where you have to actually put the work in to \"unlock\" the romance. Sure, it's great that developers are finally including strong queer characters, like Ellie from The Last of Us, but it feels a little fetishistic that too often directors/producers/video game developers will default to queer female characters if they want to make them a lead. It's like they're anticipating too much backlash from the straight guys in the audience if they're forced to watch two men kissing on their screens, so they're trying to show some representation but in a way that caters more to the creeps in the assholes than the queer community.\n\nI'm sure there's a lot more queer representation that I haven't seen, including some truly fantastic examples from all across the spectrum, but this is just what I've seen in my own personal experience. I hope that I am wrong, and some of the characters I've seen have been truly fantastic, but it's a little exhausting watching a movie and have a woman casually announce she's queer and make out with another girl in a way that doesn't feel organic - it feels more like they're trying to titillate people than to actually show diverse characters.",

            "text": "Patriarchy is very real and it hurts men--A LOT. Men have been conditioned and policed into roles of violence in our society. The notion that testosterone is the sole origin of male aggressiveness is absurd. From birth on we are taught that men must be tough, masculine, and have limited emotional expression. Our toys, social roles, etc reflect this (nerf guns, firefighter dogs, etc). These behaviors we are engendered with are generally meant to make it so that we are on the side of the subject of vioence (masculine), and to avoid becoming the object of violence (feminine). Men will obsess over this hierarchy endlessly to the point of harming others. They also harm themselves by limiting their own expression within the bounds of what is acceptably masculine. Men who are so caught up in being masculine are essentially living their life as 50% of a human being by not allowing the expression of other, non-masculine behaviors.\n\nSociety polices men into these behaviors by shaming men and threatening men with a low threat of violence. It starts as a child usually, when you were bullied or shamed in school for certain behaviors. Think about it--you can't even wear certain colors as a boy or man without experiencing shame or hate. Parents do it as well--they would probably want their child to be a bright, non-violent kid, but they run the risk of allowing their child to become an object of violence if they do not impart some level of \"toughness\" upon them.\n\nThis cascades into a series of ridiculous learned behaviors and ultimately inhibits men from developing the same emotional understanding and maturity that women have, by contrast. Violent reaction is considered more acceptable than an emotional or rational reaction in a man's behavior.\n\nUltimately, this does not bode well for men or people in general. Problems which could be solved by cooperation or mutual understanding are solved through violence. Writ large, this amounts to large-scale conflicts and wars because a handful of men cannot make a decent compromise with another handful of men without inciting violence for some perceived dominance in a completely ethereal, made-up hierarchy.\n\nMen suffer the most from this. In most developed countries men are beginning to become far less educated than women. They commit suicide far more often and face great pressures from the \"performance aspect\" of being a man. There are less social support systems for you because, oh, you're a man, you'll tough it out.\n\nSociety also believes that because you're a man, you are fit for compulsory military service. From the beginning of history until today, young men have been snatched up out of their homes in conscription, indentured servitude, serfdom, slavery, etc to hate, fight, suffer, and die at the whim of a more powerful man. There are millions upon millions of ordinary men thoughout history who have died unknown and uncared for because their society chose them to fulfill the role of violence against their will.\n\nThe worst part is that I haven't even BEGUN to describe how this affects women and those we perceive as feminine.\n\nI would implore all men reading this to consider the behaviors that have been imparted upon you and to stop lying to yourself about who you are. You can have hobbies that are not visceral, physical, \"masculine.\" You can have emotions--in fact, you might find that you can love yourself and others around you more when you're able to express a full range of emotions and not just anger. You can be a full human being.",

One of the real problems losers go though is that of the vicious cycle, an endless hellhole that leaves one fatigued and debilitated. The loser's attitude is poor to begin with, and he may also be socially inept. As he gets older, he becomes more anxious and, thus, more nervous. Social ineptness and nervousness will ultimately lead to disaster, which in turn will add to the loser's pathetic luggage.

And that is true, even for the introverted women and the good girls who say they want a good guy. Now flip the coin. Men don’t fall in love with a good heart, they fall in love with good looks and femininity. And that is true even for the good men that want a peaceful and loving life with the same long-term partner. People don’t fall in love with a good heart by itself if it doesn’t come bundled with any of those other qualities that are the true attractors. The “true attractors”, however, are not what holds long-term relationships together; they are just what create lust and attraction. This is why “sexy macho men” and “beautiful women” have many more opportunities for relationships, but they don’t necessarily keep them, and all those relationships are not necessarily successful or good ones either.\n\nYou can be smart, have a tough degree, and work a lot, and still not be as “successful” as someone who didn’t have any of that but who recognized and grabbed a very valuable opportunity that ended up working out well. Ultimately, recognizing and grabbing those “right opportunities” will matter more than all the hard work you did. And (here is the hardest pill) those right opportunities may not even be in the field that you prepared yourself for thinking that it was great.\n\nAll those people that you thought that had their lives in perfect order and everything under control didn’t, it just looked like it to others. And you only realize that for real when you reach their age and see the truth. And this is true not just for random people, but for school principals and even presidents of countries.\n\nNow, let’s close with a more optimistic hard pill because it really isn’t all bad: real happiness has more to do with your mindset than with what you own or what you have achieved so far. If you have the right mindset (without faking it) then you are happier than thousands of people who have a lot more than you in every category (but they don’t have the right mindset). Note: this one is a hard pill to swallow for them, not for you! 😉😎",
