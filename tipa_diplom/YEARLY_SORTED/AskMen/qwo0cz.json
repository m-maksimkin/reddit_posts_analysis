I've never been invited to a skin-head meeting (even though I used to shave my head) or a white supremacist rally of any sort. I've never personally heard white people talk about how bad non-white people are. I've known a few cops, and they never said anything derogatory about non-whites. I've never known of a single white person to have any intentions to do any harm, cause any discomfort, or harbor any malice toward any non-white person on the basis of race.\n\nMy wife is black. None of my friends or relatives have taken offense or objection to this. I get encouragement and compliments all the time from strangers, and I've experienced zero hostility.\n\nI'm in Richmond Va. You know, the capitol of the confederacy and home of Monument Ave.\n\nI'm not saying racism doesn't exist. I'm confident that it does.

Even the religious conservative family members and friends Ive had (and I grew up in a VERY conservative hometown) still cared about that.  Anytime Ive seen a couple where the woman does not work or barely brings in money, its because she has small kids she does most of the care for or shes disabled and cannot work. Once her kids are in school her husband expects her to work, either some or all day. And if she ends up not doing that, the husband is not happy about it.\n\nBut apparently every guy on the Internet has the 1940's mentality where they could care less about a woman's job and money, where that is all women care about for them. Its bizarre to me.\n\nHeck, Ive known several men who turned down a woman they were kinda interested in for a LTR because of money reasons such as she she didnt have a good enough job or ambition and they didnt want to solely provide for her or whatever related to that, and have observed several relationships become fraught with fighting over it.\n\nI think .2% of men have this extreme view and post over and over about it on the Internet.",

Freshmen year I was really down and lonely so I was really grungy (not goth but like 90’s grunge) looking and nervous around girls. Sophomore year I spent half the year going after a girl who kept playing with my feelings and I was really tense and nervous. Junior year was bold, I started talking more and I was still nervous but not as nervous as I was around girls. It’s my senior year and I’m not nervous or awkward at all. I’m definitely better looking and I got Invisalign which has been fixing my teeth as they were always a little crooked. I’ve been told many times by girls that they thought I was gay and I never knew why. I don’t talk fruity, I don’t wear tight or expensive clothes. I have a very rock and roll look about me or so I think. I’ve also been told by one of my friends that she says I’m very mean to girls. Not in an outwardly rude way but more under the radar and she says that’s probably why they think I’m gay. It’s never made sense to me and she’s never really cleared it up well for me. I try to be nice around girls though so idk. Another thing is that I don’t want to have sex until I’m married. It’s always been an important thing to me and I’ve found few girls that want to do the same. It would bother me to be in a relationship with someone who has fucked other guys. Anyways I’ve never gotten a hug or a kiss but maybe it’s because I can’t find anyone that I’m interested in.",

Never really had the friends or opportunity or wealth to travel with or they considered me as an option to do any of those. Never actually succeeded in my application for any single job I’ve ever applied for, just been situational references to who I’ve known and even then they’re terrible. Never seen my abs in my whole life. Never had ‘the talk’ with my family growing up about the birds and the bees. Never went on a random adventure or spontaneous trip. Never had a birthday party. Never had any celebrations or commemorations about anything in my life other than my mum caring, and no one else. Never achieved anything I am truly proud of, even my degree or education I don’t have any pride for. Never ever walked up to a woman to gain her interest or ask her out. Never really had a sexual or fun dream, mostly nightmares or just blank. \n\nNever had Starbucks. Never had a grandparent I bonded with or really knew. Never experienced true intimacy. Funnily enough, never failed when I’ve gotten a work interview, always seem to pass those amazingly. Never had more than £10 at the end of the month (perpetually working on minimum wage with expensive costs of living and burdening family members). Never tasted shrimp or a lot of seafood other than cod, tuna or salmon. Never had a ‘best friend’, just close people who have come and gone at various stages. Never been invited as a guest to a wedding. \n\nNever had dry elbows or knees. Never done jury duty. Never had friendship meaningful enough for them to want to do a secret handshake with me. Never been to a concert or had friends who wanted to invite me to go with them as a group. Never been to a sports or performance event. Never had a massage. Never had the money to buy a good suit that fits my height and weight. Never had the push to dream about being bigger than just my surroundings. Never naturally been invited to things without me deliberately making myself known. Never been to a funeral. Never had a close or even known cousin to me. \n\nThere’s a lot and I’m 24 and I’d like to say that things get better and there’s ways and opportunities to do stuff but after already facing hopelessness, perpetual poverty, leeching family members, incredibly low self esteem and then suicidal ideation for 12 years, it’s hard to see beyond the fog.
