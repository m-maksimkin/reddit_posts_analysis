The stereotype of your partner nagging you because you didn't put your dirty laundry in the right place 'one time' is just the absolute tip of the iceberg of things that she does that you don't see. When your response to the nagging is 'if there is a problem tell me about it so I can fix', know that the act of doing that is just another job that she then has to do, on top of the other thing that you aren't doing.\n\nSeriously this is huge. Do you coordinate whether or not your kids are going to their friend's birthday party? Do you know where the extra bandaids in your house are? When is trash day? Who is due for a doctor's visit? What are people going to have for lunch tomorrow? Will you need half and half soon? Where will the things you want to get rid of go? What are you doing so your partner can advance her career? On and on and on. So many men just let their partners become the household manager, on top of her job and raising kids (if any).\n\nThe especially insidious one has to do with loneliness in old age. So many men let their partners take over evvvverything, it even extends to personal relationships. Someone might have a few friends, but come to rely on their partner for social planning. It's part of the reason that men often end up totally alone after their partners die; they have let that other person manage their social lives and forgotten how to do it themselves.\n\nDo yourselves a favor and read this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0UUYL6kaNeBTDBRbkJkeUtabEk/view?pref=2&pli=1\n\nYou'd be surprised how many problems in your relationship stem from the fact that you are not actually trying to work towards an equal partnership, even if you think you are.",

Yes you’re giving a little, but that’s a part of dating. \nThem picking up new hobbies or making small time changes because it’s something you like or do isn’t them “giving up themselves”. They’re trying to relate to you more, or simply they saw you doing it/liking it and decided to try it out. \nIf they’re willing to move somewhere with you or do things to support you, do not automatically jump to “they’re giving up their dreams for me” people are allowed to want to support their partners and do big things for them. \n\nGranted each situation is different, and sometimes these are red flags like it being a brand new relationship so obviously use discretion, but these are things I’m having to unteach my partner because other people tell him my choices (which are entirely my decision and I privately weigh my options and make sure I’m sure before saying anything) are me sacrificing my whole self and giving up on everything for him and that it’s unhealthy and he needs to break up with me before I give up everything I am because I was willing to compromise with him!! But as the person who’s making these decision, I’m just looking at my options and usually, the best one for me is also the one that works for him. Not every compromise or choice that doesn’t 100% favor me is giving up on myself at all. \n\nAn example is, I was considering going to a college in NC before we started dating. Decent program, affordable. But recently, I’ve learned I REALLY HATE academics. Like, I’ve already been here way longer than most and I’m ready to be done and just start working. I never really brought up that I had changed my mind because I had only ever brought it up as a “I’m considering this” type thing and had made the decision super early on in the relationship, so I didn’t ever express that I had changed my mind. I didn’t see it as super important. Later on, He expressed wanting to go to a bigger university after graduating and maybe changing majors, meaning his choice might not support our current major. Considering I had no set in stone path after graduating beyond working in town, the fact I hate where I live currently, and the amount of time we will have been together when we graduate, I figured I would move with him, find a job In the new area and work on gaining experience and professional connections. If I really want to, I can pick up some courses at the uni he chooses. I saw a reasonable idea where we both get what we want. (Me, a chance to move and work, him more education) He saw this as me giving up on my dream to go to the school in NC, and sacrificing my education and myself to go with him. It took me having a breakdown during our finals for him to realize I was serious about being done with school and that it was damaging my mental health, because people had him convinced I was making a colossal sacrifice without having any actual information. \n\nAlso FUCKIN COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR PARTNER!!!! 95% of the problems I’ve had in relationships could have been solved quickly and easily if they had communicated when it was happening and I could still fix it. Instead they would wait until it blew up into a huge beast of a problem. I had a relationship end because they had so many problems with things and never told me until they dumped me. You can go to your friends/family, but bear in mind they don’t have the whole picture and can sometimes take things way out of context. Many times they’ll end up giving you advice that’s harmful because they won’t have full context. My current partner and I almost broke up due to people giving their two cents to issues they had no actual information on, and then him internalizing their comments instead of talking to me about it.  Now? We’re doing better than ever because we actually communicate and listen to each other, and we don’t take people’s opinions at face value.",

Learn what expectations your partner has, even in daily things, and if possible try to incorporate those into your daily routine. Dont always wait to be asked to do those things. \n\nFor example, when I was young my grandmother (who raised me) would get annoyed if I didn’t bring her hangers when she was doing laundry. I’d say “the empty hangers are right there in my closet, you could just go grab them.” I’d think it’s not that hard for you to do. Why are you getting on me about it? But years later and now I can see that she shouldn’t have HAD to go get them, and I shouldn’t have just expected her to simply because it seemed like a minor thing to me. And it was frustrating to her to continue to ask me to do it.  \n\nSo if it’s important to your partner that dishes don’t sit in the sink, or that the check book remains balanced, etc, try to learn to handle them regularly as part of your lives together. Even basic chores. Learn if your partner prefers to have the bathroom trash emptied regularly, or if they care wether clothes go on the floor or in the hamper etc. They aren’t big things per se but there are certain things your partner shouldn’t have to regularly ask you to do. The concept of the “honey do” list has always been weird for me. Look around and do things that need to be done. Dont only do things when the other person asks you to. Dont put the burden on them of managing your own tasks. \n\nIn other words, your partner wants to be a partner, not a parent.",

Bring in the washing, make the bed, empty the dishwasher, etc. Not to be a dogsbody or doormat but to be a team member. Have a cuppa or a glass ready for her. Feed the dog, fill the pets water dishes. Change the litter box.\n\nBe the one to pick up the milk etc on your way home, or at least reach out and ask.\n\nBring in the mail, bins etc. Or put them out. If you’re competent on a computer, create a reminder for birthdays, etc. Not just yours, but hers and both your extended families and friends.\n\nActually listen. Don’t talk over her and interrupt her. She’s probably dealt with that most of the day. Ask questions and clearly signal when you’re getting overwhelmed. Sometimes we have to bottle it all up till we get home, it’s unfortunate but it can bring you much closer. \n\nFor many partners, it’s not just the physical load it’s also the mental load that gets exhausting. And don’t just half-arse it, do it properly. She “shouldn’t be grateful I do anything around here” because you’re a bloody adult. The daily chores are half yours. If she works longer than you, half doesn’t even count.\n\nI’ll say it louder for those snoozing in their recliners - **FOREPLAY STARTS WHEN YOU GET OUT OF BED**",

Women will work toward love, never like.)\n\n2.  Have an opinion, likely about everything. She wants curtains, even if you don’t care, develop an opinion. Your opinion means you care about things that matter to her, and thus you care about her.\n\n3. Conflict, Passion, and Love are tightly related. You don’t have to fight to have conflict, you just have to be willing to fight for something (related to #2). She wants to see you are passionate about her and the relationship. \n\n4.  You are never “one person”.  You can “get” each other. You can like the same things. Just dont do it to the exclusion of being your own person, and making sure she is her own. You have your own life, she has hers, and you both have yours together. The worst part of the wedding ceremony is “and two become one”. Two never become one, they become three - the person on the right, the person on the left, and the married couple together. Maintain your own life.\n\n5.  Make sure you talk about the important stuff early (not on your fourth date), once the “new” wears off. Make sure you have similar ideas about education, religion, family, kids, money, success, work, location, vacation, travel….. There will be a time where you think “hey, we may not have the same idea about [insert topic here]”. When that happens, talk about it. It’s not a fight. In this case, you are both right. You just need to see if you are compatible. If you are hard opposites, then date, have fun. Don’t marry or move in together. \n\n6.  You CANNOT change another person. You can try all you want, it’s easier to move an ocean one bucket at a time. Instead, feed the things you like/love, starve the ones you hate and communicate. Support them if they want to change, and accept when they don’t.\n\n7.  Don’t ever shame them, not even once. You can have an opinion, but it should never be shame, or cause shame. Respect their body, mind, and soul as though it was carefully designed by god themselves. It doesn’t take much thoughtless body shaming to ruin their opinion of themselves. So don’t do it.  Perfection is only found on the screen with excessive use of an airbrush.\n\n8.  Jealousy has no place in a healthy relationship. Jealousy pushes out trust and trust is the most valuable part of any relationship. Jealousy is never about the other person. It is only about you (the person who is jealous).  If you cannot control it, seek therapy. Seriously, it’s something you can seek therapy to get help with and it is likely rooted in trust with yourself or someone very close to you. \n\nI’m sure there are more, but I’ve got some things to do.",

Obviously not everyone would be like this and despite what I said I don’t hold any ill feelings towards her, she just either wasn’t ready to work on herself or didn’t know how, or maybe even chose to stay in that little dark spot because it’s their comfort zone. They don’t know anything else but sadness but at least they know it. To be in Comfort for them might not be the same as being in a comfort zone, You know? I don’t hold anything against my ex and genuinely wish the best for her, but sometimes you might find someone that may only bring you down with them. In which case you gotta focus on yourself, not them because only you can work on yourself; Not others.

I learned a lot about myself, and what works and doesn't work... a few notes from an older person's perspective, and from one who is FINALLY in a partnership relationship, not a lopsided one...\n\n1) We make each other breakfast, or lunch, and have it together, helps that we both work from home right now. When we didnt work from home, we made work lunches together on the weekend and froze them, but we always make dinner together if we're both home. If one of us will be late, the other one makes dinner, but it's fun to cook together. Put some music on, and just enjoy that time together, it's so satisfying to sit down to a meal you created together. It's good connection time.\n\n2) #tenminutes ( we actually call it 'hashtag ten minutes' because we're wierd ) but every day... no matter what else is going on around us, usually late afternoon-ish, we sit down together with no tv or music or interference, and just... talk about our day. It usually ends up being 20 minutes or 30 minutes but that ten minutes reconnects us one on one no matter how busy the rest of our day was. If you have kids shuttling to activities and a busy busy household it's even MORE important even if it can feel impossible to make happen.\n\n3) Learn your partner's language of love. Do they show you they love you by doing things? Recognize that and appreciate it instead of waiting for a love note or a romantic gesture that may never happen. There are 5 love languages, look them up and learn about your partner, instead of just wishing they spoke the same one as you.\n\n4) Communication is key. I know when something is on his mind... if I didn't do anything wrong, then I don't worry about it as far as thinking 'what if he's mad at me'... he's not... so I just wait til he's ready to talk about it, which he always is, eventually... but badgering your partner, who has gone into their own headspace for a while to have a think about something, is inconsiderate and intrusive. Learning how to communicate with your partner and not always make their mood/headspace about you is important.\n\n5) Life outside of the relationship. I've seen it in the other comments and it's key for sure. I heard a staff member of mine get invited out to a fishing weekend with the guys and he said, jokingly 'I'll have to check with the warden' Argh... no.... each partner should be able to feel as though plans with friends are ok.. and not necessarily a huge issue. Go have fun, without your partner, and breathe a little... give yourselves an opportunity to miss your partner.. which you can't do if they're on  lifelong piggyback ride and you're never apart aside from work.",

(Don't bitch, moan, or whine.  No one cares)\n2. Man the Fuck Up (Suck it up, boy.  No one cares)\n3. Work your fucking ass off (Hard work fixes everything.  No one gives a shit what you intended to do.  Show us what you did).\n\nNow, these are great life lessons.  These things will get you through school, work, career, fitness, dieting, and a lot of other things in life that are really difficult.  They will keep you humble.  They will keep you honest.  And the accomplishments that come from these will give you a world of earned confidence.\n\nBut they'll destroy a relationship with a good woman.\n\nThese are the wrecking balls smashing through the support columns of your relationship.  Why?\n\nAt first silence and sucking it up will help, but its deceptive.  Yes, she wants you to listen.  But she wants you to actively listen.  And she wants you to listen differently.  She doesn't want you to just hear the facts.  The facts and details are the seasoning.  The emotions are the entrée. She wants you to understand how she FEELS.  If you misremember the facts of her story but remember how she felt, you'll be much better off than if the reverse is true.\n\nBut that's only half the battle.  She ALSO wants you to tell her how YOU feel.  And man if that isn't the biggest kick in the ass for men raised like I was.  You're told over and over that no one gives a shit about your feelings.  That your value as a man comes from what you can produce and provide--from how hard you can work and how well you can protect.  No one gives a shit about your tears or your belly aching.  \n\nBut she does.  She's learned a different lesson.  She's been taught her whole life to connect to people through emotions.  To be inclusive and work as a member of a team and a group.  Its how a lot of folks were socialized.  \n\nIs it bullshit that society does this? Hell yes.  Is it still a reality for a lot of folks? Also, yes.\n\nYou have to talk to her about all the things you believe no one wants to hear or care about.  If she is a good person, she won't laugh at you.  I know you think she will.  She won't.  She'll be happy to you shared your thoughts and feelings with her.\n\nI don't just mean the happy ones.  I don't mean the sweet talk and the cutesy nicknames.  Tell her what scares you and worries you.  Tell her when you feel like you can't do it.  All those things that you hear in your head and squash down and ignore.  Tell them to her.  \n\nShe knows how to deal with those better than you because she's been dealing with them her whole life while you've been pretending they don't exist.\n\nAnd if you spend enough time with her, as I did in my last relationship, you'll learn a whole lot and be equipped with a bunch of new skills that will also serve you well.\n\nJust don't forget to keep on listening.  Yes share your thoughts and feelings.  But it will begin and end with you listening to her.  Not listening while thinking about what to say next. But listening, thinking about what she is saying, and trying to understand the FEELINGS she is trying to convey. Be interested in her story. Be attentive and active in your listening.\n\nIt may well make a world of difference.",

Are you sure you're going to commit yourself to this woman? are you sure it will all be emotionally, mentally, physically, rationally, spiritually and philosophically worth it? Would you grieve for your whole life if you lost her? After that aspect, the other value would be the value of you yourself, so vice versa. The next aspect would be the value of your affection and hers, as for what they say; the rarer things are, the higher the value. If a woman rarely had shown her affection then that gives it more value, same for yours. But be careful not to make it way too rare to the point that the value itself will not be able to catch up to how rare it is. which results in emptiness, which is also caused by giving too much affection, losing it's value after redundancy. So IMO it all revolves around the value.",

As a man, I'd see a problem and I'd instantly shift gear into solution mode: \"Well you could try this\", \"Have you asked them that?\", \"Have you thought about X?\", etc. Or even worse, I'd just start working on things to fix the issue by myself (depending on what it was).

You have to have drives and intentions outside of each other, because codependence is horrific.  You need your own passions, your own friends, your own *life*, or you've nothing to share with the other.\n\nAnd this goes both ways, certainly, so relevantly to your question, I've helped people through worries and jealousy about their partners leaving them as they meet other people and grow new friendships and relationships.  I'm poly, but even in monogamous couples there's a requirement of trust in all that.  And it's a beautiful thing to see the first \"Oh...\" moment.\n\nRecently, I was helping a friend who just got a new boyfriend... she hadn't really dated before.  And he came to me for help, because he didn't understand all of this.  He was terrified that if he wasn't her everything that she'd leave.  That her wanting to go out was evidence that she was done with him or he was doing something wrong (which, honestly, was a good sign; he was looking to improve, albeit not in the right ways).\n\nThis was... maybe four months ago?\n\nShe took up tabletop gaming (Vampire game she found) and he was extremely nervous... so I sat with him and we gamed while she went.  She made friends.  \n\nA week ago, they had a date where she got to talk about the ideas she has, because the group is likely going to turn into a LARP as the group is getting vaccinated.\n\nHe called me, giddy, saying they had the best date they'd had in years, because she was so excited to have something to talk about, that he didn't know about already.  He liked getting to see her excitement.  And she liked the attention he gave her for her enthusiasm.\n\nLast night, he called me and asked me to explain poly to him, because she's ambiamorous, and happy to be with him, but he's actually open to hearing about it.  His words to me will probably stick a while:  \"Hey dude... I listened to your advice, and... I had this whole thing wrong.  Like... you were right, I wanted to possess her.  But now she's the woman I fell in love with again, and I know she was diminishing herself for me.  And that's telling.  So... I know I asked you not to talk about it, before, but can you tell me about poly?  I wanna know her, and I feel like I should know something myself before asking her about it, right?\"\n\nSo I talked about it with him and sent him Kimchi Cuddles (awesome webcomic for good healthy relationships regardless of style), and... now I get to wait and see.",

This doesn’t mean don’t compromise on day to day things, but don’t fundamentally change who you are (unless it’s for the better!) and don’t expect the other person to change. In the long run, both will be miserable. 3. If a person is insanely jealous or combative, get out of it. That shit usually will not get better. 4. Recognize that time and experience will change people, physically and mentally. This is neither good nor bad, just a reality. If you love that person, love them for who they are, not who they were, or will become. 5. People want to feel secure in a relationship. Don’t do shit to cause the other person to not feel secure. Be open, be honest. 6. Be willing to give of yourself and give your best. Be present. 7. Know when to give the other space to pursue their own interests, hobbies, dreams. Support those pursuits. 8.

It would be easier for my parents to accept if she were an absolute trophy, but she’s not exactly that either- in fact she’s gained weight and I’ve lost 99% physical attraction to her over the years.

I realized that I loved her for who I thought she could be and not who she currently was. I had so much cognitive dissonance about giving up on her vs pushing her to succeed. I sometimes wonder if things would be different if we were both poor, white Americans to pursue love more liberally.\n\nIn the end, I sometimes wrestle with the fact that I may have lost my soulmate due to logistical/extraneous factors I could do nothing about.

I've been sober 13 years plus, & in those years, I really worked hard to analyze my past, my behavior, my choices, motives, etc.\n\nWhen my grandkids were born, I started trying to build some ideas of good people to look up to, begining with my granddaughter because she was born first, which got me to start researching women's history, which led to understanding that although some things have changed, many things have not, which led to listening to women's experiences & paying much more attention to the men around me, the men who date my daughters, the men my friends marry or date, etc.\n\nThe biggest issues I see repeatedly are the inability to feel uncomfortable, which often translates into men being incapable of change. I do understand that many men feel lost or unsure, even afraid, & that dating seems dangerous or they aren't sure how to talk to women, but the men out there who want to be role models are usually preying on those boys & men.\n\nIf you want to have a better relationship with any of the women in your life, not just your lover, girlfriend, wife, you need to be more aware of what they experience. And there are dozens of women writing books, articles, blogs, making videos, about their experiences but men are deeply resistant to it.\n\nAnd I was that way once too, we are taught & fed these ideas & perspectives from boyhood on, in the same way that women realized their worth as objects can start as young as 5 years old. But so often, online & in the relationships I am witness to, men wave that off, or they continue to perpetuate these dumb ideas like alpha men, & if you cry, you have to say you cried like a bitch, etc.\n\nIt is uncomfortable to talk about, to listen to what the woman in your life says & go talk to a therapist or your male friends, especially because when you try to evolve out of that, half of your male friends will try to hammer you back down. Too many men see the partners as the soul source of comfort & love. They are fragile & prone to outbursts, they refuse to learn to cook or to take on more chores. I can no longer remember how many times I've had to watch a wife ask their husband, how come when I ask Nick to do something, he does it right away, but it takes you a week?\n\nWomen are often choosing to settle with the least problematic guy they know. And it is SO easy to shine as a man if you do this. Sex will be better, your relationship will be better, she will brag about you, it can really transform your relationship. But my inbox is filled with hate mail from men I've never met for leaving comments like this. They get outraged that I suggest they have things to learn.\n\nAsk your mom, your sister, your cousin, women who won't feel intruded upon, but ask them what its like to just exist as a woman & what do they wish men understood? I'm really just describing what I have done & it has radically changed all of my relationships with all of the different women in my life. I just wish we didn't talk so much about their husband, or ex, or new guy, & the repeating pattern.",
