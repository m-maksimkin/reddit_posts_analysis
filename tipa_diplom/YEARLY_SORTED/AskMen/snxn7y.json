            "text": "Before I go on, I am 42, so for this experiment we are going to assume I am somewhere between 16 and 25.  \n\nThere are reasons I would definitely sanction a world war for, reasons I would take up arms and put my life on the line for.  And then there are reasons I won't do any of that, no matter what the circumstances are, even under penalty of imprisonment or worse, death.\n\nAnd I think it is safe assumption this thread exists because you have war with Russia on the mind.  This particular topic appears to be dominating the weak minds lately.\n\nSo let's talk about that, today's topic of WWIII.  So Russia invades Ukraine.  And then Germany decides it won't take the natural gas it said it would.  And Europe follows suit.  And in response, in theory, Russia attacks Europe.  Then the US joins because of the NATO obligation...  Wait, you see the problem now?  Anyway, let's go ahead.  And because we joined due to our NATO obligations, China jumps in on Russia's side.\n\nIn this particular case, I willingly go to fight, and potentially die in a foreign war.  Why?  Because Russia attacked NATO members, and we are honor bound due to our explicit contract to come to the defense of NATO member countries, specifically if they are attacked by Russia.\n\nAnd back to being 42 years old.  At 42 I will still attempt to join that fight, I won't have to be drafted.  And regardless of whether or not I am accepted, I will also support sending our children to fight, and potentially die in that war.\n\nBut let's look at it from a different perspective, right?  I did say \"yes\", I also said \"no\".  So let's address \"no\" for a moment.\n\nOkay, Russia invades Ukraine still.  Germany still goes back on their agreement.  The rest of Europe still follows suit.  But this time Russia does not attack any NATO members in retaliation.  Instead, we(the US) decides to destroy the pipeline.  Then Russia attacks a NATO member nation as retaliation.\n\nIn this case I refuse, both to fight, and to send our children to fight.  Why?  Because we would be the ones who attacked, not the other way around.  Even if Germany was to destroy the pipeline, and Russia was to attack Germany in retaliation.  I still would not enter that fight, and would not support sending our kids to fight.\n\nTo boil this down, if we provoke it, shame on us.  If we are attacked, shame on them.  It is real simple for me.  I am not going to die for a dishonorable reason.  And I wouldn't dare ask anyone else to for a dishonorable reason.\n\nAnd propaganda is irrelevant today, it no longer works.  You either have a valid and honorable reason for war or you do not.  If you have a valid and honorable reason for war you are almost assured victory, if not quickly than in the long term instead.  If you do not have an honorable reason for war you just lose, 100% of the time.  And I am, personally, not in the business of losing.\n\nThis is also why we have not actually won any wars recently.  Our government cannot get widespread support because none of our recent wars are based on wholly honorable intentions.\n\nHonorable causes cannot be stopped, you don't even need propaganda to feed an honorable cause.  Honorable causes feed themselves.\n\nLet's look at WWII...  Even if the allies had failed in Europe and Germany conquered Europe, that is as far as they would have gotten.  The moment Pearl Harbor was bombed it was over.  It was an entirely dishonorable action.  This completely galvanized our entire country behind one blatantly obvious goal.  Pots and pans factories started making bullets.  Car manufacturers started making jeeps and tanks.  Textile factories started making blankets, cots and uniforms.  Fuel was rationed.  Food was rationed.  Our entire country was effectively turned into a giant military machine.\n\nThat is what war looks like.  If you are not willing to do that, all of it, you might as well stay home.  If you can't do that, if you cannot justify militarizing the entire country, you can't win.  Period.  You just simply do not have the conviction to back up your military action, if you are not willing to militarize the entire country.  Besides, why would you enter a war and only go half way into it?  Does that even make sense to you?  You only partially commit to it and still expect to win?  Really?",

Nuclear bombs put an end to most such warfare.     \n\n\nHistorically soldiers had  the chance for promotion, acquiring land, slaves and possible reproduction, willing or not. Now there is no benefit to the individual or their genes. .  The corporations acquire the rights to the oil.   In the US, the Veterans Administration health care for injured veterans is reportedly terrible. \n\nThere is also the issue that the draft is all male,  which is bad no matter how you look at it.  if you believe men and women are the same, then it is not fair.  And if you think that on average, or on standard deviation, they are physically, emotionally and intellectually different, then presumably certain military jobs are best done by women, others by men.  Either way an all male draft is just wrong.",

I'm not ancient, but if I end up among the drafted things have gone seriously wrong and I'd need to see an obvious strategic advantage to the continued maintenance of a standing army. Mostly because the continued need for more men would make me think it was an extremely defensive war at that point. Not only that, but being pinned in that quickly from all around would be a technological feat that would indicate lateral warfare was no longer a viable option. If you can't win at that point you have two choices. To rip as big of a fucking chunk out of your enemy as you can with your life or to assimilate. Personally, I can't say one way or the other which I would choose and it might come down to as little as what color drawers I wore that day. Assimilate does also allow for the option to infiltrate.

Keep reading.**\n\nI can tell you how most people are going to react.\n\nThey're going to go, and they're going to attempt to keep their heads down and their wits about them so they can try to get through it without too much trouble. And many of those will die.\n\nA minority will decide to resist the draft or run from it. Most of those will just go into hiding here or somewhere else until it all blows over and amnesty is granted by their home country, which would now be in need of able-bodied men to staff its labor force. A smaller proportion will Muhammed Ali it and be outspoken openly and gladly go to jail for it.\n\nBut most will go along. The ultra rich and the elite are in power because that is the pattern of behavior humanity has exhibited for, oh, ***its entire existence.*** People who want more power in their own lives will resist the urge to resist authority knowing that is a long-term play with a large risk of failure and a more immediate opportunity to improve one's own lot and the lot of one's family would be to go along with it. Accept the draft. And attempt to make it through unscathed.\n\nMost people want to have a life where they get to dictate what they themselves do, but aren't very concerned with what others do so long as it doesn't hurt them. We already know both from history and psychological/sociological studies that most people are highly susceptible to orders from authority and are at least coerced by the threat of force quite commonly. We already know that in disaster or emergency scenarios that most people are out for numero uno first. We know that human beings are highly susceptible to misinformation, even if they're not swayed by it at first. Hell, there's a published article I read in the field of neuroscience not to long ago that the words someone uses in regular conversation with you alters the physical structure of your neurons which are processing that information.\n\nAll that is to say, most will go. Most of that group will willingly go because of the information they've been fed. There's a lot of comments in here about how a draft would never work today or how they'd not go or find a way out of it. A few of those people probably would do what they say they would. Again, history and psychology/sociology tells us that most of them would not.\n\nOh, and the draft would ***100%*** function more or less as it has in the past. Conscription has only not been a thing in the US since 1973, roughly. But conscription was always an option for the US from **the Revolutionary War through the Vietnam War**. So, about 200 years. So, all this ideation about how \"I wouldn't do this or that.\" Yeah. You probably would. If the government declares a draft, it's because they're ***desperate***. There are somewhere around 3-4 **million** people who are either on active duty, in a reserve component, or in the Inactive Ready Reserve. A draft would be after that, and probably after they've called up able-bodied retirees who are under the age of 60 in critical MOS and specialties. If you're not any of those people, and they need you? Oh, they'll find a way to get you into the military, or they'll make it extremely hard on you. They'll also harass your family about it incessantly. You'll have to put your life on hold, and when the war is over (if there are surviving countries and yours is one of them), you'll have to answer to whoever is the ruling party then. I guarantee getting a job will be a difficult task. \"So, what did you do during the war?\" will be a common question because if your boss or manager is a man ***and didn't*** resist the draft, I guarantee he'll have real strong opinions about people who did when he didn't resist it and had to watch his friends die for someone else's war. Because it's human nature to say, \"**I had to go through it, so you have to, too!\"**\n\nIf your number gets picked, you're probably going to decide to go because you won't really have any other good options and your decision to run or resist it would likely impact negatively the lives of your family members and your future. I say good options because the other options are fine options if the post-war society is different than they historically have been. But then you're betting against history and humanity's tendency to keep doing what it always has done. That's not a safe bet.\n\nThose of you without family of any kind? I believe you when you say you'll resist it. I don't see why you wouldn't.\n\nBut I suppose the question asked me what ***I*** would do. Well, I was infantry within the last decade, so I'm getting called up before the rest of you, anyway, if it's within the next (\\*checks how long I have until my age window is up\\*) ten years. After that, I'll go, anyway, because my kids will be old enough to be drafted, and if my sons are going. I'll be going.",
