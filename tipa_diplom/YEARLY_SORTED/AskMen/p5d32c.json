    "What behaviour do you see from other guys that you just don't understand?\nShort post, but recently myself and my gf had a pregnancy scare, everything came back clear and everything was ok, but my gf was still nervous. Later on we're pretty drunk and about to have sex, I put the condom on (we agreed on this beforehand) and she bursts into tears. I take it off, start hugging her and reassuring her. Afterwards, she said thank you for being understanding and not making her feel bad for not having sex, as other boys have been annoyed at her for not having sex/saying no before. \nIt just made me think of all the times I've had girls say no after I've brought them back (not a player, this was very rare) and I respected it without coercion etc. I could not understand why guys would do this.\n\nAlso, socks with sandals. C'mon guys.\n\nSo yeah, as the title says, what don't you understand?": [

The moment you have no money to give them is the moment they won't talk to you again till you pay them. I just find it so shallow and so delusional.

And I don’t mean literally, though also sometimes that. I mean when one guy says or does something mildly macho douchey, then the other guy just HAS to put his two cents in and be more macho douchey, and it keeps going until there’s a fist fight or someone reasonable steps in and tells both the idiots to calm down. It happens even if the problem is as simple as “that guy annoys me”. I see it all the time with some of my friends, and especially with one or two of my coworkers. A good playful roast is fine, but when you’re constantly trying to put others down just to express your wannabe “bUt I’m aN ALphA!” status, it really just makes you look insecure and pathetic. I’m all for dudes bantering and lighting each other up like a good firework, that’s just “dudes being dudes”, but there’s a way to take it too far, or to turn it sour quickly. \n\nThe problem arises when two dudes don’t know when to slow down, and maybe they already have some beef, so it just turns into a perpetual pissing match every time they’re in the same room because they’re both too stubborn to admit they’re being childish. It’s one of the most toxic male behaviors I’ve ever seen, and that’s coming from a guy who’s spent a lot of time in mostly/all male environments. It’s kind of hard to describe, but the gist is that it’s a constant battle to “1 up” each other, with clear intent behind it to prove “I’m the boss here so cut your shit out”. \n\nMost guys when they see it happen either pick a side and help, roast both of them, or just stay out of it entirely. I’ve been all of the above many times, but most often I’m the one that has to tell them both “will you please SHUT UP?!” It’s infuriating, and it’s even worse when it disrupts other activities, such as work, pick up sports games, video games, hell even DnD. Ive seen coworkers almost get into fistfights over literally nothing. Ive seen shouting matches over ball possession in a park game of basketball. I have two players in my DnD campaign who almost get into in game fights every week because of this dumb shit. It’s even more embarrassing when there’s women around, because then the inch long measuring sticks REALLY come out. It really gives all men a bad name. Its a problem so prevalent that it has literally started/almost started wars. It’s so common that we have multiple idioms to describe it, so I would hope this long-winded explanation is enough for anyone to understand what I’m referring to and relate their own experiences.\n\nTL;DR: Quit the 1-up, dick-measuring, pissing contests; it’s stupid, childish, and embarrassing to every other man on the planet.",

I'd thought I was being assertive, but tried being more aggressive, and it actually worked a little, but I couldn't keep it up. It was exhausting! I had to constantly think about how to project either aloofness or sly selfishness, I couldn't just be myself, and I couldn't understand other guys acting that way just naturally, effortlessly.\n\nThen I met a girl who reacted the opposite of every girl I'd met up until then. She didn't think I was boring; she thought I was considerate and thoughtful, and she seemed to have eyes for only me. For the first time in my life, I got to just be myself, and behave in the way I thought guys of good character should behave, which was just the sort of behavior she was waiting for some guy to show her. More aggressive guys who tried to \"charm\" her away with bravado got only eye rolls.\n\nSo, other guys out there feeling like the \"jerks\" get all the attention from girls: girls are all different. What seems like \"jerk\" behavior to you is, to some girls, just part of being fun and playful. Nobody's in the wrong here. Be yourself and behave the way you feel is right.

For context i go to a very IT and 3D driven College in which the male to female ratio might be around the 1 to 9 or something like that, of which many of the females are either bisexual or lesbian. For this reason very few of the guys here ever really interact or have been in relationship or been friends with the opposite gender. Many of these guys would also be your typical nice guy or neckbeard due to this type of education sort of being the place where they congregate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk here's the story. \n\nHere last april i was at a smaller (Covid tested) party with a female friend of mine from another class. Many of the people that would be there, were people that i had never met and ended up with a fair few she didn't know either. Throughout the night people would talk have fun and of course get drunk. At around 12 or 1am a group of guys i had never talked to before rolled in, they seemed nice at first, maybe a little socially awkward but you know, not that bad. Now to note my friend was the only of two girls there in which the other girl already had a boyfriend she was sitting with and within not too long of the new dude getting to the party i was witnessing them both use group pressure to make her drink more and some even physically coming up and touching her or pulling her with them. She was clearly not enjoying it and it got to a point where they even ripped her leggings apart. Me and another guy had to fucking tell them that it wasn't right and they for some idiotic reason could get it into their head that ripping and drunk girls apart. Even if you she was comfortable with you beforehand, what the fuck are you doing? Me and the other guy had to help her back to her dorm room, so that she could get away from there and they were even fucking following until we got like 50 meters away from the dorm in which the party was happening. It was probably the weirdest and grossest thing i have witnessed another man doing in person and the fact it was an entire group thinking it was ok is fucking abssurd to me. \n\nAnybody that can explain where this logic is coming from?",

I guess it happened again. I used to always keep a supply of condoms and all kinds of stuff like massage oil. That shit gets old and can't be used anymore.  \n\n\nI'll never buy condoms again. Massage oil. Candles. I'll never buy any of that ever again because women always change their mind last minute, can't commit, don't know themselves, don't feel confident about something arbitrary like having small tits, whatever. The point is that the great majority of the time, they're going to back out.  \n\n\nI think guys should be prepared for that. Expect it. It's just how women are, they back out at the last minute for whatever reason. They have a million whatevers like the astrology being off, or suddenly thinking you look like their dad because they found a mole on your back, or suddenly thinking you're like a brother to them, or suddenly remembering an ex boyfriend who is now totally associated with sex so now they can't have sex anymore... whatever. There's a million whatevers.  \n\n\nI used to always be prepared. Wasted well over $100 on condoms, and thousands on everything else. Men should be brought up to expect that women are just going to do that. You basically can't expect sex at any time until maybe they're married and definitely in their fourties. Women in their twenties and thirties are NOT mature enough, don't know themselves, and can't commit to the act. Almost always back out last second.  \n\n\nAnd then like you said, pregnancy scare. Just one of the million whatevers. Women are kind of bad at making the decision to actually have sex and go through with it. It is what it is.

I Goldberg speared him though a wall! He was mad and hurt. Cops finally show up and arrest him. Needless to say he was back the next day. Here's the part I don't understand. Why do some men continue to abuse women!? I mean I understand the behaviour you see on a daily basis you eventually grow into yourself. But I didn't. I constantly seen my aunts and sisters and mom's boyfriends beat or hit them. I also constantly fought them back. Not caring how much I got hurt. Only caring that they stopped getting hurt. That grew into me fighting for women I didn't even know. I make it my business when I see a women getting abused. \n\nSo.. my question. Why do some men still beat women!?",
