    "How would you react if a female friend told you she was sexually assaulted?\nEdit: the reason I ask is because when I told guy friends these were their responses to me:\n\n“Are you sure you don’t just regret having sex?”\n\n“Did you lead him on?”\n\n“Were you drunk?”\n\nSo thanks to the guys who responded with helpful and genuine things. You kinda restored my faith in men a little.\n\nEdit #2: WOW. I didn’t expect this to get so many responses. But I promise I’m trying to read every single one of them no matter how fast they come in. Thank you to all the men who’ve responded.\n\nEdit #3: Getting a lot of questions through messages/chats. Figured I’d answer them once instead of over and over again.\n\n• this was 5 years ago and they are no longer my friends \n\n• I have a much more supportive group of friends now\n\n• I did give a statement but I didn’t press charges and I didn’t get rape kit (which I highly regret)\n\n• it has recently been revealed that the guy who raped me raped multiple other women. I will be helping with the investigation. \n\nHopefully that’s all the questions.": [

This is because once someone has accused a man of assault of some kind, our life and career is basically over. Second, because all of the false accusations a lot of us have gone to instinctively defend our own sex. In the same way a lot of girls would support an accusation as it is only natural to defend your own kind.\nAlso they probably wanted to grasp the seriousness of the situation and try to help you based on the facts.\nAgain I'm not saying you weren't assaulted i don't know the story.

I listened to their stories, I offered to help them in any way I could, just let me know and I would be there for them.\n\nOne was an ex that apparently came into her apartment at night on 2 separate occasions and assaulted her while she was in bed. The other was a dude we knew, that no one really liked, but he hung out with us because he thought we were friends and he was so shy no one really had the heart to tell him to go away.\n\nBoth times I confronted the guy in question and neither knew what I was talking about.\n\nTurns out in both cases, after finding out I confronted the accused the women both said it wasn't true. The one with the ex just wanted us to stop talking to him since he was still friends with many of us in our friend group, the other thought it was just a good way to get us to tell him to go away. Both the men took a hit socially, the shy guy took one emotionally and both girls have had no consequences and would laugh about it. I cut both of them off after that, cause fuck them\n\nNow if I were told about a sexual assault, tbh I would be skeptical until I had more proof and have no idea how I would react. It is way to easy to destroy a man's life with false allegations.",

It's a calm approach that helps them cope, makes it less awkward for me, and let's me fully grasp the details of what happened.\n\n\nI've had two friends tell me this and my approach has been the same for both.\n\nI think it's natural to have questions like \"were you drunk\" or something like that, specifically as a harmless curiosity. Just because she was drunk doesn't mean it wasn't assault, but for a victim this can very easily sound like an attack on them so it's important to word it carefully. So I basically just ask them to tell me their story, in as much detail as possible. Typically it also helps them to just vent and get the story off their chest as well. I think it helps them feel heard and it reassures them that as their friend I'll help them should they ask for help, but it also solidifies the notion that if they want my help they'll need to approach me for it. I end off the conversation with a nice \"is there anything I can do for you\" kind of thing, and in one case (happened after a night at the bar) my friend asked that I walk her home sometimes, which I have no problem doing (we live about a 5 min walk from one another).\n\nI might get some hate for this part but I think it's equally important: this approach also helps me to hear a portion of both sides, without asking for it explicitly. If you ask them to tell you a story, the assaulted and assaulter become characters of that story and therefore you can follow along from both perspectives, with a grain of salt.",

We were also trained to not assign blame to any party and to make sure that the victim knew what their options were (restricted or unrestricted reporting) and also that they were always entitled to medical/mental care resources. \n\nI disliked the training because of the repetition and the inconvenience, but a lot of it stuck with me and now i am much better prepared to handle these events.",

A close friend of mine with some other mutual friends were having dinner and the table discussion was about religious views on sex and sexuality (we live in a conservative country, but not THAT conservative). It comes across odd when she started to ask certain questions involving sex, rape and the sins involved in hypothetical situations. We answered things quite objectively and I can tell she felt some sort of relief and assurance to the answers that she's hearing as much as she tries her best to hide them.\n\nAs we called it a night and went our separate ways, I decided to approach her at her car, ask her if somethings up and why she was so invested in the discussion. It took her some moments of silence to summon the courage up to say it, she finally opened up how she was victim of sexual assault and she has always blamed herself for it while she kept fearing her worth would diminish and get rejected by her SO's family (they planned to get married next year) while her own family would be ashamed by it if they find out about it. She told me how it happened and how much it affected her since then. The incident haunted her life and she keeps finding ways to get her mind of it from overworking to self-harm when those feelings overwhelm her. I really wouldn't wish anyone to go through it considering how much it leaves that much of a scar to her mind after all those years and that guilt she carries.\n\nThroughout my life I never understood how much sexual assault could affect a woman until my friend finally opened up to me as she was shaking talking about it. I did my best to comfort her, assured her it was never her fault and just listened as much as I could as I felt at the time it doesn't feel proper to ask questions since if I ever word it wrongly, those questions could implicate it was her fault. NGL, it was an eye-opening experience and I never took light of rape jokes again after that night and men, we need to be better.\n\nEdit: Grammar and articulated some phrases.",

My friend group proceeded to dox me, slut shame me, and ghost me. I thought I was a disgusting whore. My main friend in the group said what I did wasn't cool and the group needed a break from me. It wasn't until I took a psychology class a few years later that I realized I was raped. I didn't consent to some stranger having sex with my passed out body and taking MY virginity. Rape to me was being brutalized by a man in a dark alley way- not the confusion I was feeling. The time immediately following the rape, I had sex with multiple boys bc I felt like a whore and acted on it. About 3 months later, I had a bf who said he was wearing a condom and he wasn't- he specifically lied so I'd have unprotected sex with him. I immediately knew I was pregnant. I was adamant about aborting it. Again, I was only 17. He was 22. I would make the appointment and he would need more time to get money for the abortion, I was probably 10 weeks by the time he had enough money. He was trying to sabotage me into keeping the fetus. I had taken a pregnancy test at home and my then best friend's little sister saw it and they proceeded to tell ***everyone*** I knew. My senior year of high school was hell- I lost all of my friends. I had to keep the abortion a secret from my family and that warped my mind.

An ex of mine that I was still close with broke down to me and told me how she was with her Church friends and felt safe - and then one of them took advantage of her and raped her when she fell asleep after a couple of drinks.\n\nThe second time, a friend of mine opened up to me and admitted to me how she was taken advantage of by her high school teacher and repeatedly raped in her senior year of high school. It was horrifying to hear and she was suicidal over it. I talked her out of taking her life several times.\n\nHonestly, for both times, I didn’t know what to say. I just stayed with them and tried my best to be there. Our school offered counseling, too. So I offered to go with them as I’d been going for my own reasons.\n\nI always try to take care of my friends but it just felt so powerless to hear that from them both. Like, it’s not like I could change what happened... all I can do is be there while they come to terms with it and decide how they wants to move forward.\n\nI’m a dude.

            "text": "Depends on the context. I have these kinds of conversations a lot with the women that come into my life. If it’s something from the past, I practice deep listening, I allow myself to feel their pain, and give them the space to talk through what happened. If the case is that it’s something that just happened, I’d do a lot of the same, make sure that they do not need immediate medical attention, and offer to go with them to the police to report it. A lot of women won’t report it, for complex reasons, and while that is ultimately their decision, I do feel that gentle encouragement is wise. But it shouldn’t be pressed if it is something that just happened and they don’t want to. Some women end up regretting not filing a report, some just don’t want to deal with it and move on, but it can help prevent future women from being assaulted so if they can deal with the process, it can ultimately be a way to take back some of their agency and be beneficial. \n\nIf the assaulter was someone I knew, I would be very, very tempted to do some violence. Haven’t had that happen yet. I think it’s usually wiser to let the police and the courts deal with it. \n\nOne thing I’ve done with a lot of the women that I’ve known is teach them basic self defense. It staggers me that we don’t do this as an institutionalized norm. It’s a great way to empower them and help them get over the trauma of assault.",

Nearly all of them have been the victim of sexual assault or rape.  In nearly every case the offender was a repeat offender who had gotten away with it.  Marine culture includes \"small unit leadership\" which means issues or concerns are handled at the lowest level possible.  The kicker is that alot of people think that means they can handle assault rape without reporting it up the chain.  This includes the victims!!

I get that she doesn't want to \"rock the boat\" or whatever but the problem is that she is hardly ever the only victim.  Because she's afraid to say something that offender becomes more and more bold and targets more and more victims until one of them reaches a breaking point and says something.  \n\nTo be clear I am *not* blaming the victim here.  The offender is entirely responsible for their own actions.  But this isn't going to change until the military creates a culture where victims are no longer afraid to out their defender at the highest appropriate level.\n\nBefore anyone says \"Madated reporting\" I know that's a thing.  I also know that people are willing to go to extraordinary lengths to protect their friends (the victim and the offender) from percieved threats (retaliation for reporting and punishment for offending)\n\nMany male Marines have  also been victims of sexual harrassment or assault as well but it's way more open so it's handled very differently (completely ignored).",

I've had multiple individuals tell me they were raped and not one time did I think to blame them for being raped. Yes, women have lied about being raped after regretting sex with a person. I blame the judicial system for that. If false rape accusations were treated just as serious as a rape itsself i doubt people would falsify information about it. But to answer the op question, I would just talk to them. Like if friend felt like they could trust me with that info I would do my best to show them I care and that I will do whatever to help them get justice or feel better.\n\n\nOkay so side thing, in the military we were taught, \"if she's drunk she cannot give consent\" so as a man, if I'm drunk, and she's drunk, and we have relations, how can I be held responsible for a rape if I too was raped due to not being able to consent? I've never raped anyone but we all know what rape looks and probably sounds like. So i guess the morality of it is \"if you feel something is wrong it's wrong\"?  Personally I can't continue to bone if I sense she isn't having a good time..it's a huge turn off for me.

The guy got arrested for trying it with another girl a few days later at a party and pretty much the entire party was beating him up. Someone had called the police during all of that and he was taken away. I regret not being there because to this day I still want to beat the shit out of him.\n\nAnother friend of mine also got assaulted at a party. She had gotten drunk and her ex was upset that she was dating someone new and, like the piece of shit he is and in his own words, felt like he deserved her virginity. Typing this out is making me pissed all over again. Anyway she was blacking in and out and for a while nobody could find them. Eventually people found him in the middle of violating her as she was unconscious with his hand over her mouth in case she woke up screaming. Some people at the party had seen when he brought her to the room but didn't say anything (they gave some bs reason at the time, saying they thought she was flirting with him and whatever) but when other people noticed what was happening they rightfully pulled him off of her and, like the story above, beat the shit out of him. To make matters worse is the ex was a family friend of hers and her brother and I are decent enough friends. I heard all of this out because while the sister was at the party, the brother and I were out at another friend's place. He got the call saying what happened and he didn't say anything to us and just got up and started goigg to his car. I followed him and all he said was he was goigg to kill someone. He's one of the calmest people in the world and doesn't even say that kind of thing as a joke so I immediately knew it was serious.\n\nI hoped in his car with another friend and we bolted to the party. When we got there the POS was outside with everyone cursing at him and threatening him. As soon as my friend saw home, without shutting off the car he jumped out and began beating the shit out of him. Police showed up just a after he started and arrested both my friend and the assholes. However when people properly explained what was happening the officer let my friend go with a warning and telling him that if asshole decided to press charges then they would have to come back for him. POS was going to press charges but his entire family disowned him and he eventually decided not to. Guy is in jail now and last I heard they kick the shit out of him regularly in there.\n\nAll this to say that if any of my female friends say that they've been sexually assaulted I take it absolutely seriously. It's why fake allegations bother me so much. People who are sexually assaulted experience something so horrific that I cannot even begin to relate to. I hate it so much.\n\nWow this ended up a lot longer than I thought it would. Sorry for the word vomit.",

I told her she didn't have to tell anyone more than she was comfortable with, even her boyfriend (due to the nature of the assault STDs were not really a concern), but that I would support her if she wanted to report it (she didn't).

Because it doesn’t matter what happens to you - doesn’t matter if you are the victim of a crime because at the end of the day - no one gives a shit & you still have to pay your bills & feed your family.\n\nAs another example, when I was 20 - I proposed to my high school sweetheart during a sailing trip in the British Virgin Islands (*it was the two of us & my cousin & his GF*).\n\nShe accepted & the next three days were some of the best days of my life, the fourth day however was one of the five worst days of my life.\n\nLong tragic story short - there was a boating accident where a drunken guy hit the dinghy we were in, knocked her unconscious & into the water.\n\nShe was found by divers 20 minutes later (*which is damn near miraculous considering this happened at 2am*) & I got to sit on the end of a dock with my guts kicked out watching them perform CPR on her lifeless body for the next three hours.\n\nI’ll never forget the image of her laying there in the bottom of a filthy dinghy & her skin pale & almost translucent in the light of the moon save for a hand shaped bruise on her naked breast.\n\nAs you might imagine, that pretty much broke me for a long time but it wasn’t two weeks later when I told my parents that I just didn’t have it in me to meet a family obligation that I had been scheduled to perform & asked if they could find someone else to cover for me this one time. \n\nTheir response?\n\n“*What happened to you was terribly sad honey, but you still have to complete your responsibilities - besides it is just a couple of hours, pull yourself together, do the thing & you can feel how you want afterwards...*”\n\nMy parents were not monsters, just realists & it took me years to realize that however harsh, they were right.\n\nI had obligations to perform which would have serious consequences to other people if I did not meet them & my “*personal*” problem just didn’t matter in that context.",

Next I ask if they reported it and if anything came of it. If they did not, i will ask why but I wont pressure or even ask them to report it. I will ask if they want me to for them if they did not report it but if they dont want me to, that's okay. It's up to them, I just offer to make it easier for them. After that I ask if their is anything I can do to help and what happened (if they are comfortable sharing). People have a tendency to say things to me that few people know so I've actually had many people say stuff like this. I've even had many people say things to me that no one knows but me.

            "text": "I can only list one example.\n\nIn my mid-20's, I owned a house I rented rooms from. One room was rented by a trucker, a woman, who was on the road the time of the incident. I was allowing her little brother, 17 about to turn 18, to stay in the room while he looked for work; she was paying for the room, and it was a hard situation for him, so I didn't raise a fuss. I took a shine to him, as he was earnest, and like a puppy almost. Worked hard, played hard - he somehow managed to get himself a construction site job even as a minor. Good kid.\n\nA couple of months pass. Shortly after his 18th birthday, I threw a huge party and naturally he was there, the star of the hour. A woman at the party took an interest, and they retired to his (sister's) room.\n\nThere were something like thirty witnesses. Moving along.\n\nAfterparty, I'm sitting on the porch, and the woman and boy - man, at this point - come out; she grabs him and sits him in her lap, and was *not* shy with details until I begged off. The kid was mortified, but proud. For his first time, it seemed like an ideal outcome. Better than mine, for damned sure. I didn't have a room to take her to my first time. Ahem, anyway.\n\nThree other witnesses. There were six of us total during this conversation.\n\nShe kissed him, groped the hell out of him, and left. Note to all: she was sober. She could drive home safely.\n\nSo that's the end of the night, right? I gave him a condescending speech about not doing that again in my home while I'm looking out for him, he's a guest not a tenent, etc., and tell him not to bring any other women by when the house is empty or without warning me ahead of time, etcetera and so forth. His face just getting redder the whole time. Like he wasn't sure to be proud, embarrassed, or ashamed he broke a rule he didn't know about.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I find him frothing at the mouth on my living room floor, after trying to kill himself with a bottle full of his sister's Vicoden.\n\nAs it turns out, a he-said-she-said chain of words had reached his ears. And those words were, 'he raped her.'\n\n....\n\n....he raped her. His first time, the girl that kissed him goodnight, that *thirty witnesses saw* drag him into a room, that *four witnesses* heard the gory details while she held him down in her lap, told her friends he raped her.\n\nAnd he tried to kill himself. In shame. In fear. In heartbreak.\n\nYou see, he was not a pretty man. Frankly he looked like he hit every branch of the ugly tree on the way down. He was tall and strong shouldered, and that matters to women, but his face... well. Insecurity might be putting it lightly.\n\nAnd this touched *all* his buttons. Abandonment by his family, except his sister. Rejection. His pride taken from him. The girl *didn't want him.* And prison. Eviction. Just after he got a new job, was old enough to rent his own place, he feared facing down the barrel of everything falling apart all over again.\n\nBut we knew. He had us. I called everybody that had been there that night and asked them what they saw. The people on the porch, especially. At the hospital, I brought them to him. They volunteered to testify on his behalf. I did too.\n\nAnd I put the word out. Tell the girl what happened. Tell her what he did. Where he's at right now. And ask her what she's gonna do.\n\nA few days later, she comes alone and straight up apologized. I didn't press. But I asked the reason. \"I was embarrassed.\"\n\nShe was embarrassed.\n\nFor that and a slip of the tongue, a life almost ended.\n\nI'm sorry. I know it's important to allow victims safe space to tell their stories and find justice.\n\nBut we, collectively, have a *problem.* And it's a different one from the rapist problem.\n\nThat's my story.",

It's up to men, to change the culture among men, but it is up to women to empower us to do so. It is true that abuse stems from abuse, but accountability and relationship are vital to healing that abuse. Men bond in strange ways and sometimes being held to account for our higher selves, even through a show of dominance, can be transformative. Not that I am advocating violence, but I'm not a pacifist either. \n\nAs I write this my blood cools and I question my own instincts, but a bully is still a bully and sometimes a bully needs a punch in the nose, followed by an offer to rejoin community after making amends.

The abuser was the roommate that she had started dating before we decided to be roommates.\n\nThe first thing I made sure to do is listen and while listening to her make sure she felt safe and emotionally validated, since she was also being gaslighted at the time and wasn't sure if she had been assaulted or not because of that kind of manipulation.\n\nThe second thing I did was offer her whatever she might need to help; a safe place to stay/sleep, driving her to where she needed to go to get legal help at the campus we both went to, etc.\n\nA big issue was trying to approach the situation as best as possible given that me, her, and the other person (unaware until later on that things had happened) were living with the abuser, which made the situation more difficult. I wanted to approach this in the best possible way for me friend and made sure to do things on her terms. In retrospect, I could've and likely should've done more, but because of things that were unclear in the early phases, it made it difficult to know exactly what to do, especially having never been in a situation like this before.\n\nDuring the midst of this they officially broke up, but problems were still occurring.\n\nLater on, especially since the abuser roommate had been becoming a problem to everyone in the apartment apart from who he sexually assaulted, we all met together, discussed the situation, the somewhat out-of-the-loop roommate was informed of the situation, and we all agreed to get him evicted. This was in January 2020, for reference, just after our college's winter break had ended.\n\nI had stayed at the apartment over the break, and the abuser roommate had been as well. Since I had a feeling that this was going to be something that'd happen, I made sure to track as best I could what problems occurred during this time, including all violations of the apartment's policies (such as not allowing guests to stay over for too many nights in a row, as he was having a new person he was dating staying with him in his room for weeks on end). Normally, I wouldn't give a damn, since a lot of apartment/landlord policies are exploitative. However, in this situation, I was able to leverage that to the advantage of my friend as evidence.\n\nThe three of us then coordinated emails to the landlord of the apartment complex to get him evicted (the apartments rented by bedroom rather than by overall unit); my email was extensive in recounting the events my friend described, as well as the violations of the lease that the abuser had committed, including minor things such as infringing upon the personal property of tenants, which was a legitimate complaint to be fair.\n\nThis was happening around the same time that legal action was being taken to issue a restraining order for the abuser as well.\n\nShortly thereafter, I think before February or just after February began, the roommate was evicted and out of the apartment entirely. Due to the nature of my state not having great policies protecting sexual assault victims and the lack of physical evidence he couldn't be tried in any more substantive criminal case.\n\nAfter that, because he was no longer in the apartment, I simply removed all his contact information and blocked him. In the rare instances where I've passed him on campus I've essentially ignored his existence.\n\nIdeally, a lot of what we did should've happened far earlier, but given issues of various stresses, life issues, unfamiliarity with what to do, etc., it took longer than it should have.",

I was told if I didn’t I didn’t like him and etc etc etc. and then after he threatened to kill himself when I tried to break up with him and had cut himself and made sure I knew. It was emotionally awful to be yanked around like that at a young age. I don’t know what it’s considered. I just had to say even if someone had regretful sex, it may of not really been their choice to begin with. Afterwards he gloated to everyone in the school saying how I couldn’t take his dick. Things like that. Being manipulated into sex can have the same psychological impact as being raped. So I just wanna say to anyone who was manipulated that it’s not your fault, either. Being in a weak state and being taken advantage of til you break isn’t okay. And that’s not your fault. Coercion, rape, assault. Whatever you wanna call it doesn’t matter. You didn’t consent because you ever wanted to.",

Afterwards, I asked my therapist for advice on what to do if this happens and he pointed me towards some great resources. I’ve copied and pasted one I find helpful below. You can find the original here. \nhttps://wecare.illinois.edu/help/support/\n\n#Supporting a Survivor: A Guide for Family and Friends\n\n**Source: University of Illinois Women's Resources Center**\nWhen sexual misconduct affects someone you care about, you may feel upset and confused. At a time when you may want to help most, you might be dealing with a crisis of your own. Your support at a time like this can be extremely helpful to a victim of sexual misconduct. Here are some guidelines to help you through this time:\n\n**Believe.**\nBelieve their experience without questioning or blaming them. Whatever the circumstances, they did not ask to be a victim of sexual assault, stalking, domestic violence, dating violence or sexual exploitation. It is very common for victims to blame themselves, but the blame for sexual misconduct rests squarely and only with the perpetrator.\n\n**Respect.**\nRespect the fear that victims can feel even after the events are over. The perpetrator may have threatened to harm them if they did not comply. Help survivors deal with their fear by finding ways to increase their safety.\n\n**Accept.**\nThe survivor may have strong feelings and they have the right to their emotions. They may feel numb, sad, angry, in denial, terrified, depressed, agitated, or withdrawn. Be supportive by accepting all of their feelings and provide an atmosphere of warmth and safety.\n\n**Listen.**\nLet the survivor know you want to listen. Try to understand what they are going through.\nLet them talk and do not interrupt.\nFind time to focus on the victim. Ask what they need from you.\nYou may feel nervous about stalls and silences. It's okay to be quiet.\nTry repeating back the things they've said as a way to continue the talking.\nReassure them that they are not to blame.\nAvoid asking blaming questions such as, \"Why did you go there?\" or \"Why didn't you scream?\"\nTake the events seriously.\nPay attention, help validate the seriousness of their feelings, and recognize their need to work through these feelings. Being a victim of sexual assault, stalking, domestic violence, dating violence or other forms of sexual misconduct can be a shattering experience. Recovery is a process of acceptance and healing which takes time — sometimes months or even longer — and requires support.\n\n**Stay.**\nStay with the survivor as long as they want you to. Many victims of sexual misconduct feel frightened and vulnerable about being alone. This will pass with time.\n\n**Let the victim make their own decisions.**\nDo not pressure them into making decisions or doing things they are not ready to do. Help them explore all the options, but respect their privacy and confidentiality. If you are not required to report incidents of sexual misconduct based on your role with the University, then it may be beneficial to support the survivor in determining whom to tell about the sexual misconduct. However, faculty and staff who are made aware of sexual misconduct must immediately report the incident to the Title IX Office.\n\n**Care about their well-being.**\nIn order to care about your friend, you may need to cope with some difficult emotions of your own. If you are experiencing rage, blame or changes in how you feel about your friend/relative, you can be most helpful by finding ways to cope with your own emotions. There are many resources, including counseling and advocacy services, that can help you process and feel empowered as an ally. Please check out the Resources for Family & Friends for assistance.",

Responsible and eyes-opened humans ultimately realize the prevalence of this reality and treat others with compassion and not derision or strawman-based doubt. It’s a huge world-wide societal issue. It’s sad, but a lot of us probably have neighbors, “friends,” or family that have rapist inclinations and associated mental degenerations.

It was late at night, when the library (which is very large) was mostly empty. Emma did not report the attack because she had no corroborating evidence and didn't think anyone would believe her. \n\nEmma liked to party and had problems with alcohol, so much that she ended up dropping out of law school and not graduating due in part to a single vehicle car wreck she got in while drunk. Kyle was a bit of a frat-bro but not someone who came off as a sexual predator. I was unsure if I believed Emma, because some times Emma made things up and didn't tell the truth. That being said, she didn't gain anything by making up this story. And if Kyle had raped her, she would be just the kind of person he would want to target.   \n\nIt has always made me feel guilty that I did not, and still do not, fully believe Emma. on the one hand, she has no reason to lie and the fact that Kyle doesn't fit the stereotype of a sexual predator is no reason to automatically absolve him. On the other hand, she does have credibility issues. But that may be the exact reason he targeted her, and by doubting her I am, subconsciously, perpetuating the kind of thinking that may have allowed him to escape responsibility for so long.",

One finally came to me in tears begging me to help.  \nThe only reason I hadn’t reported it sooner is that I thought it was only me and hopefully that was enough.  \nAfter reporting, his father came to me and begged me to drop my charges against him because I was pregnant with their grandchild and they wanted to be apart of her life. \n I wanted to disappear, I even thought about ending my life because it felt like everything completely fell apart.  The mental torment not only from my abuser but from his manipulative family was too much.\nI did drop the charges, they didn’t even bother to stop me or ask if I had been coerced to do so.  My family didn’t believe my story, so I had no support from them on the matter. \nMy abuser went to a mental heath facility and because my family didn’t believe me I wound up staying with him, had our baby.  Things seemed okay, he was attending therapy and only touched me if I consented to it.\nOur daughter lived for three months.  I had only been back to work for two weeks when I got the call that she had stopped breathing.  By the time I made it to the hospital she was gone.  My gut knew he had done it intentionally.  The detective was able to prove this.  He had swaddled her, laid her face down on our memory foam mattress and then left the room, she suffocated and died scared and alone.  \nHe tried to say it was my fault in court even though I was at work.\nThe Judge let him off with 90 days in jail and three years probation.  He has already finished his time.\nI blame myself every single day for her loss, if I had left, if I hadn’t retracted my charges, she would still be here.\n\nThe reason I share this is because it is extremely important to provide support to those that come to you about sexual assault.  You could be saving their life and their children’s life.  You could stop it from happening again.  Just by saying okay, I believe you, how can I help you through this.\nIf I hadn’t been completely picked apart things could have been so different.  \n*this is as much detail as I am willing to share, it isn’t a complete account of what happened but a summary, the details are to hard to repeat even now*",

We'd been drinking of course, and so we were getting more candid and started venting about our respective relationships. Just little stuff at first. But during our walk, she started talking about how it was difficult for her to be intimate with her boyfriend because she would get panic attacks as they were having sex or during foreplay, etc. I asked why, and she paused before sighing and telling me that she had previously been raped.\n\nShe's such a bubbly, happy person and she didn't fit my young, *very* naive assumptions about rape victims. She hesitated to tell me she was raped, but then suddenly she just said it so plainly -- like she was commenting on traffic. It hit me like a truck and stopped me in my tracks.\n\nIf I remember correctly, after I realized I was standing there shocked and slack-jawed, I just asked if she wanted to talk about it. She didn't know, but she said she wanted me to know what happened to her (we'd been good friends for 2-3 years by then). I had no words, so I thanked her for sharing and assured her she could always talk with me. She eventually told me more, but at that time I think she just wanted someone else to know. I think my response, while clumsy, was ok. We're still really good friends, so maybe I didn't fudge it too bad.\n\nIt sounds like OP had some unfortunate guy friends who quickly went with some \"but what were you wearing\" types of questions. I've never understood that. Why, when learning something so personal about a friend, would anybody try to delegitimize their experience out of hand?",

Maybe drink, I'm not sure she was, but she did everything right- struggled, yelled, all of it. In the end, he was just stronger and bigger. Heartbreakingly, she was a virgin before this happened. It breaks my heart now just like it did then, and she's never been quite the same, though not for lack of trying.\n\nAnyhow, one night when we were hanging out and drinking together, she broke down and told me about it all. At the time I couldn't imagine why, but I really don't think she had a ton of close or trusted friends, and I might have been one of the last guys around not trying to get in her pants. \n\nWhen she told me, of course I was at a loss, and she was beside herself for not being able to even give away her virginity to a guy of her choosing. I can't imagine how terrible that feeling must be.  At some point in the conversation, though,  I told her not to worry.  \"You're still a virgin until you decide to give that to someone. No one can take that from you, least of all that asshole.\" \n\nI was pretty drunk at the time, but I didn't really think much of it. I gave her rides places and made sure she never went anywhere alone while we were in college together. \n\nYears later, she wrote me a letter to thank me. Apparently she was in a bad spot, and her hearing that from me was the first time she felt like maybe things would be ok again, and she started to forgive herself and have hope for the future. \n\nNot patting myself on the back,  butI really cherish being the right person in the right place to say that.

It’s among the toughest draws someone can get in life, and absolutely nobody should ever have to go through any event like that. \n\nI had an ex who wasn’t directly assaulted, but was blackmailed online starting from a young age. We started dating when we were both on the young side as well (mid-late teens. Old enough to date, not enough to be mature at all). It traumatized her, and it took me a while to understand the depths of her trauma because of how much she would both openly talk about it with friends and how little she showed it to bother her. But periodically, she’d either shake in fear, completely go ghost quiet, or just straight up cry. I don’t think she had fully processed it at all when we started dating, so her behavior surrounding it changed a lot while we were together. \n\nAt first when she told me, I wasn’t sure what to think. This was my first relationship, and I was handling a lot of very very new emotions, so throwing this in there.. confused me. It took me longer than it should’ve to understand exactly what effect it had on her, maybe because I’m just kinda dumb socially. \n\nI felt horrible sympathy for her though. When she would have her ptsd come up, I would just try to talk to her if she wanted to talk, bring her mind to better thoughts, reassure her of safety, hug her or cuddle if she wanted (although, very often, she very clearly did not want a guy being anywhere near her, and I made sure to respect that). When she told me though, I was just confused. I wanted to do my best to take care of her, yet I also understand I’m a little dumb sometimes and maybe I didn’t exactly help. She always appreciated it though, and we did have a great relationship. \n\nSome people don’t know how to react, especially if it’s their first time dealing with, or even hearing about someone they know going through this.

Her claim can be of anything from regretting it, to alcohol even it be motivated by revenge or to get back a them. There are even cases where everything was consensual but the next day she changes her mind and now it's rape even if it was consensual before.\n\nMy situation was a bit different, I was in college, and in that time a girl made a claim that I raped her when in fact I've never met her and she slept with someone she regretted and didn't know the guys name and just blurted out a guy's name. Since I was someone who alot of people knew around campus my name was the one she said and used as the person who raped her. So I get taken in and brought to the police station and everything and now I have to find any and everything I can to prove my innocence even though I have never been in contact with this person before and I can't just say I have never been in contact with this person. It's stressful as all get out of having to prove your innocence when you shouldn't have to but luckily I could and had receipts from getting gas that day from being out of town the whole weekend she claimed I raped her. Without those receipts I would have had no way else to prove my innocence and my life could have easily been over and behind bars just because of a girl regretting her decision to sleep with a guy and then blaming someone else. Needless to say I pressed charges against her for the false claims and she was also expelled from the college.\n\n\nSo while yes you can be a person that wants to be supportive of someone who says they were raped you can also be a person who maintains a level of skepticism and make sure you get all the facts straight before jumping to a conclusion.",

If someone is bringing me something as serious as sexual assault I need to verify the event because... I'm probably going to be suggesting you go to the police and providing my own statement on what you told me. It's not that I don't trust you, but if I'm going to advocate for you I need to do my own due diligence. \n\nWhat iv found however is that women aren't super forthcoming about the fact that they aren't NECESSARILY looking for a solution. Even on something as serious as sexual assault/rape. The idea that the person has had something horrific happen to them and are coming to you for help instantly puts guys in problem solve mode and I think that sometimes can be VERY incompatible with the kind of emotional support women are seeking. I don't think most men are naturally inclined towards seeking that type of support (this is not \"women's\" fault and it is something we as a society should work on) and therefore we aren't as forthcoming with that emotional support as we should be. By trying to help you were giving the purest form of support that we know of. \n\nI'm not super prepared to defend this position. It's a complex problem and I know when iv had it put in my lap I could have handled it better so I'm not about to lecture people on the subject. It's an excellent thought excersize though thank you for this post.",

My gay brother didn’t treat me differently lol . But The guy I was seeing at the time treated me weird after even though he told me I shouldn’t be embarrassed and that he’s so strong he sort of just dipped out but he tried coming back few days later and I ignored him and then a few weeks later he tried talking to me again but obviously I’m hurt he treated me weird . He wouldn’t have known this happened to me if it wasn’t for my psychological breakdown after the guy got arrested, it happens. Overall I’m really embarrassed about my breakdown and being a rape victim . In the past before i decided to press charges nobody believed me because I didn’t act like a rape victim, and then when he did it to another girl finally ppl took me serious and finally when he gets arrested and I hear of more girls and I had a breakdown I get treated like a damaged goods rape victim so embarrassing lol.

I was 21 at the time, and she was 20.\n\n-we meet at an outdoor mall early in the morning, and realize everything’s closed for another couple hours, so I ask her if she wants to head back to my place. I had No intention of doing anything, as we still didn’t know each other much at all.\n\nSo we get to my place, I ask if she wants something to drink, she tells me she’s actually kinda tired. I told her she could take a nap on one of the couches, that I didn’t mind. That there was a guest bed upstairs she could use. She said something to the effect of “well we’re both gonna end up there anyways”. \n\nI knew what she meant, but I’m just not a hookup kind of guy. Plus, we really truly almost knew nothing about each other past music preferences. \n\nThis next part will stay with me the rest of my life. \n\nShe tells me we should sit outback and talk on the patio swing, I tell her that sounds nice. \n\nI can’t recall the segue that led her to say the following, I think I asked her about her parents. Ultimately, she blurted out:\n\n“My Step-Dad has been sexually abusing me since I was 12”\n\nAfter 6-7 seconds I asked her what she meant exactly.\n\n“He’s been going into my room since I was 12 and making me give him blowjobs.”\n\nHonestly, I wanted to cry, but I had to say something.\nI asked her if it was still happening, which she quickly protested. \n\nI told her that I’m sorry something like that happened to her. , and that should never happen to anyone, ever.\nThat no one deserves to be treated that way.\n\nShe nodded, holding back tears. \n\nI asked if she had told her mother about it at any point, or anyone else. \n\n“I told my mom at some point but she said I was lying, I told her again another time and she told me I was going to tear the family apart, so I never said anything.”\n\nI told her I was sorry that this happened to her again, and gave her a hug. \n\nThere was some silence, and I asked if she just wanted to watch a movie or something, that we didn’t have to do anything. Asked her what movies she likes, she didn’t care so I put in Liar Liar w/Jim Carey, a light-hearted comedy.\n\nWe sat on the couch together, she grabbed a blanket, and fell asleep on my shoulder. \n\nShe woke up about an hour later and said she wanted to go home, so I drove her home. \n\nI didn’t see her much after that, but every time I drive past her parents’ place I heavily contemplate aggravated assault.",

She would tell him to stop, but he wouldn't really listen. I believe that to him it seemed like a joke, and he would state things like \"It's mine.\"\n\nI asked about confronting him about it, but she told me not to, so for the time being, I listened. I talked to some friends about it to see their thoughts on the situation. I learned that this was pretty well known with other students (we were in school) at the time. I didn't share classes with her when this happened, so I wouldn't know. Obviously, he did it while the teachers were unaware, but there were always other people seeing it happen.\n\nWe were only \\~13 at the time, middle school, 8th grade.\n\nAnyways, while I was talking about this with other people, he happened to overhear parts of the conversation. I saw this as the perfect time to confront him about it and I (not calmly) explained to him how his actions were wrong, etc, etc. After that, he stopped doing it, and he also stopped talking to her for a while.\n\nI didn't report this to any adults at the time as I believed that would screw up his life completely. I didn't really see him as someone that was purely horrible, rather he was either morally ignorant or unaware of the consequences of his actions. I could tell by the look on his face after confronting him that he was ashamed and feeling extremely guilty. It was obvious that he would regret these actions for years and would never do something similar again. There would be no reason to potentially screw up his entire life for a mistake he already learned from, especially at such a young age.\n\nI know that many of you probably disagree with my reasoning, so I would like to hear your thoughts on it.

I felt pretty bad, but I know she needed to be comforted then, not to be told why she needs to go to the police. So I did that, she thanked me and calmed down a bit.\n\nThen another girl who I know better, she was like \"ok wanna hear a funny story lol i was a freshman in high school and a college kid was drunk harassing me even in college and with a gf\". At first I told her to go to the college and tell them, she kept saying she didn't want to and that it was just a funny story. I was like \"but you literally got sexually harassed\" and she said \"yeah but it was funny\". She said she didn't expect me to take it seriously either. Then she said i killed the vibe because her funny story turned too serious! :0 (she apologized later and said it was because none of her friends ever took it seriously)\n\nWorst part is, both of them thanked me profusely, I said it's what literally any decent person would do and that all I did was sympathize (seriously I did nothing special but say \"im sorry that happened to you\" a million different ways), but both of them said \"no actually normally my friends who I tell act like it's not a big deal\". I knew sexual assault was a big deal, I don't want to pretend it wasn't, but directly seeing the results of that years later...",

Things like smell, tattoos, facial hair etc. Was a weapon used.\n\nA lot of women feel shame and may not report or tell someone for days which destroys evidence.

I just wish there wasn't a decent amount of girls that lie for attention or els it'd be alot easier for guys to have open arms. I'm also not saying like hey u can give consent then cant change ur mind part way and decide not to. I'm just saying there is a population of people that lie and guys just wanna hear the story to be sure instead of sympathising for someone that could end up lying. But it's really hard to tell sometimes especially if alcohol Is involved cuz what if there both blackout drunk and can't remember fucking eachother. Does that make the guy a rapist or?
