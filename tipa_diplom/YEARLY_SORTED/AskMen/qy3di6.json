            "text": "Therapy. Like a lot of men, I had the logical response of “therapy is great and everyone who needs it should get it and I won’t judge them,” mixed with the emotional response of, “therapy is for crazy people or people who dealt with like, legitimate abuse! I’m not crazy, I wasn’t abused, I don’t need therapy, the fuck would I get therapy?!”\n\nTurns out, nobody wins in the mental health Olympics. There are plenty of people who have faced down worse shit than me in terms of trauma and/or abuse in their day to day lives and in their pasts. I had a rough job where I struggled to perform to my own standards and to my boss’s standards. Boss was not shy about calling out errors, and not particularly nice in how he referenced them. \n\nTo be fair, some of it *was* my fault and performance. I had a lot of anxiety surrounding the 2020 election, and it impacted my work. I struggled to focus, and I was glued to news reports most of the day. I’d just moved cross country and was in a new home, still actively unpacking my life, with no real social life in the area. Work had poorly defined tickets with odd scope creep (IE the ticket said “make this element change width properly when the side bar is expanded or collapsed,” and by the time it was accepted, I had to revamp the css of the side bar and an unrelated element, and none of it was in the Jira ticket for reference)\n\nAnyway, it was a mix and match of “my work wasn’t properly defined and my boss was difficult” with “I was anxious and not focusing on my work enough to keep up with it,” and when it came to a head, I was not doing well at all. I had suicidal ideation, and got checked into a local crisis center (mental healthy facility) where there were no sharp objects, no cell phones allowed, etc. I talked to a therapist while I was there, and a lot of walls were already down by necessity. He knew I was suicidal. He knew I wasn’t in a position to hold down a job. He knew I had high anxiety. I didn’t have to awkwardly walk a stranger through all of these things. It made a huge difference when someone had that sort of insight that early on. \n\nI eventually left that facility and promptly quit that job. I retained the therapist, and I’ve stuck with him for the ensuing year. It’s been enormously helpful, and it’s helped me get my life more in order. I’ve been better at separating the stuff I *can* control and improve on from the stuff that I can’t control. I had improvements to make to myself, and I had improvements to make to how I responded to stressors. \n\nTherapy helped a ton. I’m in a much better job now, I’m making good progress towards the me I want to be…. All around positive. \n\nThe moral of this story is that there’s no minimum requirement to be “worthy” of therapy. We don’t have any requirements for how fat or fit you should be to get a personal trainer for your body. Likewise, there are no requirements for how emotionally healthy or unhealthy you need to be to benefit from therapy.",

Lol.\n\nWhat I learned is that I was more immature than I took myself for--i probably still am a bit immature in some ways.  I can't believe I got married without ever living by myself.  I equated living with my wife as opposed to her + parents as living \"on my own\" but these are actually very different things.",

I’m extremely exposed on these terrible midwestern roads, but I figure a cyclist on the road is generally a mutually destructive relationship for most motorists. Besides, “be the change you wish to see,” and I feel like climate-friendlier human-sized transportation is the future. Safe so far (knocks on head). It’s allowed me to save a mountain of cash in gas, car insurance, gym membership. I can spend that on accessories like chest cams, rain gear, reflectors and other things to further raise my safety and visibility on the road. I get fresh air and exercise all the time. You’d be amazed how much weight you lose and money you save when you and your backpack go to the supermarket every few days.

Reading books takes you to a different place, and you learn a lot more reading books than you do Twitter.",

Including outside, where you get your daily dose of vitamin D, which isn't just a vitamin, but a hormone that regulates over 700 functions in the body.\nDoing as little as ten a day can improve your health over time. And as Pavel himself would say, \"Grease the Groove\". Doing kettlebell swings throughout the day in small sessions exponentially increase results over time. Started in February of this year, weighing 235 lbs, which for a man who is only 5'7\", is clinically obese. Stepped on the scale today and I was at 196lbs. I will probably be doing swings for the rest of my life.",

Peer pressure isn’t looking out for your personal welfare, but that uneasy feeling in your stomach that you can’t quite explain *is* looking out for you. That’s your subconscious brain telling you that something isn’t right.\n\nBut I also mean think for yourself in terms of what beliefs you choose to hold, and how you choose to live your life. Have you ever been really on board with some preexisting thing, *except* for one part that you just can’t bring yourself to agree with? Change it. Just change it, for yourself.\n\nDeeply devoted to your religion, but that religion condemns you for being gay? Be religious and gay anyway, on your own.\n\nLike the idea of veganism, but can’t bring yourself to give up turkey and Swiss sandwiches? Make your own mostly-vegan diet plan.\n\nDo you actually hate going to parties, but go to them anyway when invited because you feel like that’s the normal, well-adjusted thing to do? Stop going to parties. (If anything, it’ll just make people all the more psyched if you ever do show up at one.)\n\nDo your own thing, so long as you aren’t hurting anyone or anything by doing so. You’ll quickly realize how many conflicts are started simply because someone chose to think outside the box, and other people got mad because “Hey! You can’t do that!”",

So far my overall general mood everyday is miles ahead of what it used to be, and I still haven't gotten very low mood wise since being on it. I highly recommend not being afraid of seeking out what is really bringing you down, especially since if it's something inherent like ADHD because you may have been living with a disorder your whole life and don't notice something wrong because of that. \n\nJust looking back at my younger years it's easy for myself to see I was struggling, but since I have pretty good intuition school wasn't a problem so I never got examined, they usually only do that on the kids that are failing. Since high school I was having really bad depression swings, enough to make me drop out of college for two years, but since getting treated the depression is gone and I'm back in college with all A's and it feels great. One of the biggest lies you hear growing up is that ADHD is getting over-diagnosed in kids, but it's actually one of the most non-diagnosed disorders in adults today. \n\nSorry for the long message, but I really want to preach my experiences because I know someone out there may feel that \"gifted kid burnout\" and not know what the problem is.",

Competing at the International level (both in a quartet and a chorus) and winning bronze and gold medals gave me the confidence to do almost anything. It also allowed me to travel the world, appear on national television, get my SAG card, take each of my daughters with me to England on separate occasions, win a national acappella championship (non-barbershop - a little more like what you saw on Pitch Perfect, but we sang in our own style), befriend my in-laws, who were also active in the hobby (oh, yeah, it's also how I met my wife & both of my daughters have sung in choir and quartets) and visit countries I might never have seen without the occasions that required those visits due to singing with my guys. Sadly, one of our guys was afflicted with depression (unbeknownst to any of us) and committed suicide a few years back. So between that and COVID I haven't done much in the hobby in the past few years, but I still sing with groups here and there on occasion and with friends when the opportunity presents itself.",

I'm living an adventure.\nI plan in advance for a month. Every day!\nexample: caving,  via ferrata on a Thursday at sunset after work, i use to go climbing in the trees, in adventure parks, i go to comics club often (improv and stand-up comedy), organizing board games night and cooking for all my friends, \njumping in a waterfall, rafting, canyoning, all the winter sports like sleigh powered by huskies, renting snowmobiles, renting a helicopter to go off pistes (costs only 250 euro per person, minimum 5 people, per day)\nI am lucky to be living in an area that has it all. in an hour or 2 i can be anywhere with my car. \nAlso, deciding that I'm not the worst driver in the world, gave me courage to drive again. i used to believe all the drivers are experts, and it's only me out there who gets lost even with a GPS. \ni am a girl, i got my driving license in a small town with no semaphores or 2 lines on the road. Living in a capital city its so different, every thing moves fast.\n\nit was also life changing the decision to start painting. I thought I am bad. i started by copying the art i already liked and followed lots of tutorials.\n\ni used to be a photographer but starting with covid, there was not so much left to photograph ( i like to photograph people and journalism, not landscapes), so i switched to painting. I donated my first paint in an auction online, organized to help a little girl who was sick.\nI was so happy to sell my painting and donate the money! after that, the people who auctioned for my painting said: can you paint it again? i would pay for it.\nSo i painted the same thing for a while... dozens, until i got bored of the same painting. But i still like it! It was a night sky and a lady dressed in a classic long dress, picking stars by reaching her hand up. Her hair was long and blonde, with some waves in the wind. what was special about it was the one star she was reaching, was not a painted star but a Swarovski stone, glued there.\nAlso, the entire sky was not random dots but the actual positions of the stars from the night the client was born (for example you could see the Aries sign or identify other constellations).",

On top of the long hours, we also have 2 dogs and 7 cats which we care for in a small home, which is less than ideal.\n\nA few months ago, I was on a business trip to Fujian, China and found that the pace and life style here somewhat resembled Vancouver, Canada. The kicker, it is absolutely dirt cheap to live here. Not long after, we took our quality of life and health into consideration and decided it would be beneficial to look into some small neighborhoods. We found a perfect 4 bedroom apartment 5 minutes away from the beach, which is equivalent to $290.00 USD per month, $330.00 USD including utilities. Since moving here, I have learned how to cook a lot of Chinese style cuisines, which saves us a ton of money and is much healthier compared to eating take out every meal. We have both found remote work, it does not pay nearly as much, but our cost of living has dropped quite significantly as well.\n\nOverall, we work less, we're both home more often, we're much healthier, the pets get more time with us and we don't get up every morning hating life, I would say this is a major win.",

            "text": "Not looking back at the past but towards the future instead. This was especially hard for me. I moved from London to Rome 3 years ago and a lot of problems came from that. Initially, I had to adapt to Italian society again (I lived my early childhood in Italy) and I just couldn't stop thinking about the UK. My life was just not going well at all and I soon became extremely depressed. I almost wanted to kill myself at times. My depression peaked a year after moving to Italy, which was at the start of my second year of high school. I was depressed, staying away from everyone and getting bad marks in school. I was crying all the time and I was staying away from my classmates as much as possible, except for this one kid, who had a mental illness that makes him a total social outcast. Seriously, he doesn't talk to anyone at break and I was only really speaking to him, though now I mostly stay away from him, not because I want to but because he literally doesn't approach anyone at all. That's how much of an outcast he is. At one point, however, I realised that something had to change. I wasn't going to come back to the UK any time soon. So, I started talking to my classmates, I started playing rugby, a sport I loved, and I generally just tried not to get upset over the little things because I knew things were going to get better as long as I focused on what I wanted. Nowadays, I wouldn't say I'm doing fantastic, as I was still happier in the UK, but I'm definitely doing a lot better. Tbh, it's gotten to the point where I don't want to go back to the UK out of fear that I'd lose those few friends I have now. However, most of my classmates are leaving the city to go to university in 2 years and I also think I'm going to go to Norway. But, it's awkward to think that myself from 2 years was so anti-Italy, almost racist in a way. I still don't like this country that much but I appreciate the things I have a lot more. Most importantly, I have a crush on someone now who is actually Italian, someone I didn't know very well 2 years ago. Having a positive mentality really helps a lot. Constantly thinking about someone or something you know you're not going to get back doesn't make you happy, it only makes things worse. You can't change the past but you can change the future. People had been telling me this ever since I left the UK but I wish I had just followed their advise.",

Walk away from the toxic situations.\n\nYou have a limited amount of energy, prioritize & walk away from the moochers.  \n\nMost importantly; turn a shit situation into something good or beneficial somehow.. example: having knee surgery; use the recovery time and physical therapy to get better than before the injury, etc. \n\nlove your dog, spoil your dog, their time is short on earth, make time to spend with your dog because they will always choose to spend their little time they have with you and they love you unconditionally. \n\nIgnore social media almost totally , ignore the crazy news as much as possible; i check it out here and there to be somewhat current. \n\nforget the sales, ads and trends a bit.. buy a few high quality shoes, coat, winter clothes to keep you warm and healthy. \n\nKeep your car running with good timely maintenance; “CHANGE YOUR OIL “ lol !! \n\nDon’t be changing vehicles unless it dies totally, if it runs it stays. \n\nTry to budget, use the rule 30s if you can, try to save for your future and invest in yourself. \n\nLearn from your mistakes, and move on, don’t ever dwell or live in the negative.",

Never felt better funny. \n\nThe funniest thing me and a lot of other kids I know around my age used cigarets to kick vaping when it was always supposed to be the other way around. \n\nYou felt the unbearable urge to Vape step out side and have a cig.

Made meeting up at the end of the day real easy, especially since we'd left our phones behind.\n\nI should say that my wife and I are both life long students (by now considered masters) of qigong and we've known each other since she was a Pre-schooler, so our bond has always been singularly strong, and we've been through a LOT together, being veterans, so our experiences may very well be unique, but given the OP's question, my answer is as thus.\n\nBy the way, I cannot state just how much ya'll should take up qigong, tai-chi, & meditation.\n\nThey really DO confer great benefits to your well being, physically and otherwise!

It was no longer a struggle.\n\nMy research into the topic also made me find out that if you exhale, then refrain from inhaling for a couple of seconds, then the next inhale would just vastly improve my breath. IIRC, it has something to do with the body preventing itself from over saturating oxygen, as blood-oxygen levels are typically 95% (please correct me if i'm wrong, it's been a year since I saw this statistic) and intaking more oxygen would be a problem.\n\nAnd not too long ago, I was on a trip in Kansas, and I realized if I let my body breathe like I do when I snore, which I have deliberately never done since that's how snoring noises were made, I found out that I could just... breathe. and let it happen, and I wouldnt have to worry about sleep anymore.",
