And before I get crucified here let me explain:\n- see if they look disheveled or if maybe they have only been eating crushed potato chips underneath a door???\n\n- Are they attractive? Specifically build- it is highly unlikely that a kidnap or similar type of victim is going to be VERY overweight... Most of these type of criminals usually prey on women equal to or lesser than thier weight (ensures physical dominance as well as easier clean up)\n\n- Cleavage cleavage cleavage- u definitely want to check to see if her boosoms appear to be carrying milk??? If they do it is likely they are not in an escape situation. The mental and physical health conditions and malnutrition of a kidnap victim would rarely allow them to bare children successfully- much less provide milk. NOTE- Remember if they DO appear to bare milk- the odds of her being a new kidnap victim IN PURSUIT are indeed higher due to the rising number of pregnant or milking fetishes in recent years\n\n-Take a look at her backside, does it appear like she has been running from someone or something??? If darker color pants or denim feel free to give it a snack or two to see if you can get any dust off of them- which, in any case you probably wanna just keep walking. \n\n- WHATEVER you do- with all women definitely do not look them in the eyes. You never want to make someone feel threatened, especially in that scenario. \n\n***All above comments are intended for comic relief in a time when keepin' it real goes wrong- ALL too often 😎 and no in advance not a kidnapper, just watch shit of true crime 🙄***",

Haven't seen you in forever!\"  I'm confused, because I'm fairly certain I don't know her.\n\nShe then leans in real close. \"I'm really sorry to bug you.

Funny thing is, she parked like a block away from the club - right in front of my flat. \"You ever feel unsafe in this neighborhood, knock on that door. Either me or my roommates will help you out.\" She thanked me, gave me a hug and drove off. I go back to the club.  Dude sees me turning around and walking back in and just looks down and tries to look like he's got a reason to be there. and mumbles a \"what's up\" or something as I walk past. I growl a \"fuck off\" and go back to the club.\n\nThis was back in the 90's - pre-Cellphone/Smartphone days.  The Goth/Industrial crowd kind of policed it's own and looked after each other.  Or at least it did in my city.\n\nRape culture is a thing.  The best two ways to fight it are to confront it and when you have the opportunity be a good example.

My friend and I clocked the guy staring right at her from behind and I made eye contact with him. He turns on his heel and immediately starts walking back the way he came. We waited for a bit then walked the woman a block or two down and asked if she wanted us to walk her to a bar or a bus stop to be safe. She politely declined, thanked us and was on her way. \n\nMy friend and I spent the next 30 minutes talking about how fucked up the whole thing was…You know if must’ve been bad if she walked up to two metal dudes drinking beer in public on a bench to get away from someone haha.

Well know is a stretch but it's a high-school age girl I know since we live in the same village and we're usually on the same commute. Saw her one evening at the stop with 3 men who were about 5-6 years older and she looked very uncomfortable. So I strolled up to her and went hey Susan (not her name but I wasn't about to use her real name around those guys. They smelt wrong), gave her a quick hug and started chatting her up about her dad pretending I knew the guy. They kinda backed off a bit scoping us out it felt like but I just placed myself between them and her with my back turned to them, making it abundantly clear they if they wanted to keep talking to her they'd have to be real obvious about their intentions. I'm a pretty big guy and I look mean AF (I'm not) so they skidaddled and me and her just talked until we got on the bus. I got a real hug from her on the bus tho. Felt fucking great that.",

I never go on walks. That's how you get accused of all kinds of shit.\n\nAs a brown man in Europe, especially when I was younger and was outside more, I'd frequently be questioned by police. They'd ask me who I was, where I live, where I came from and where I'm going and why I'm going there. Luckily I always had a reason.\n\nBefore covid I was approached by a 50-60something year old woman talking crazy stuff and spitting on me. I didn't say a word and moved out of the way and walked away faster. Mind you, this was in the middle of a large open space that would take several minutes to cross. I saw her coming from far away. It was around 8PM and dark already.\n\nWhen they saw that they couldn't get an \"appropriate\" response out of me, these huge skinheads ran up to the woman and walked away with her.\n\nHad I done anything else, I'd probably have been beaten up and be in prison now and there would be a headline about me being an immigrant (I'm not) or muslim (I'm not) who attacked an old lady or something.\n\nI'm also an idiot so I'd probably try to help after all",

It was like a we don't know who the fuck this is kinda look. So I pretended that we were meeting up. Then my friend behind me pulled up, he had no clue what was going on. Anyways the guy was drunk and I tried to get him to take the scooter I was riding but he didn't take it. So we just left the scooters, and pretended to walk somewhere.\n   The guy followed us and kept talking to the girls. So I \"befriended\" this dude, and just kept talking to him. I got his name and other bull shit just to keep his attention. Eventually we got to a cross walk luckily the timer was just at the end when we arrived. I said something like \"are we gonna go? Are we gonna go? It's now or never\". The guy ran across the street and I held the ladies and my friend back. And the sea of cars start driving down the road. Once he crossed the street he was completely out of site.\n  We turned around and walked them back to their car. They were saying how scared they were and that they have never met this guy.

You are likely smaller, weaker, and possibly slower than someone who’s power tripping and feels entitled to you because you are smaller, slower, and weaker. They know what they’re doing and they’re betting on YOU knowing that and being so scared you don’t feel able to do anything. \n\nAnd people in public tend to ignore shit. They pretend that they don’t, but if you live in a city, don’t tell me you haven’t walked past some truly awful shit because you just can’t deal with it or are worried you don’t understand it.\n\nThe way you change that dynamic between you and the creeper as a potential victim is to make it obvious to as many people as possible around you that someone is trying to make you a victim. Every new person who sees this dynamic is now a potential witness. And I think people generally want to be good—as the victim, you’re giving them the opportunity to do good. Even if the person is possibly a creeper themselves, most people want to be seen as the good guy. And frankly, if you put them on the spot, they tend to be so startled that it’s easier to dip if they make it weird after. They don’t often creep AS a group.\n\nHaving grown up in a city, I’ve been a girl who’s done this many many times AND been a person who’s asked a girl if they’re okay many many times. It happens a ton.\n\n**Also—if YOU feel anxious now that you’re involved in this dynamic or worried that you might be scammed, you can also bring an additional person into the conversation too. It’s just a better buffer for you both being safe if she is being creeped on. And if you get scammed, now you have a witness.**",

If you don't know it's a party area and can be a bit rough. A lady in a tight white dress with a black line down it and short black hair approached me, \"Hey Frank!\" My name is not frank.  \nShe comes over and hugs me and while she's approaching for a hug she gives me that face. You know the strained, please face. I'm thinking she's messing around and likely drunk and maybe thinks I'm someone else but why turn down a hug? So the hug is quick and she grabs my arm and says something to the affect of \"hey let's go try out that club over there.\"  \nThis is where I started to draw the line, mostly because I was actually there to meet people. So I go, \"Actually, I was heading to Castle.\" She spins around and says something like, \"You're right! Let's go!\"  So we get there and the group of people I was going there to meet is there and I explain that this random lady followed me and that's when she tells everyone what was happening. At this point she had really started to talk more tot he girls that were there and not me and I was fine with that and sort of wandered off. Only later was I informed she was being followed by not 1 but 3 guys and how thankful she was that I was so brave as to walk right by the group on our way to Castle. I of course had no idea what was going on.",

When they walked in, about a quarter of the bar turned to stare at them and they quickly left.\n\nAnd then everyone clapped. (Ain't it a bitch when you have one of these moments, but no one can believe your story because of the vast quantity of bullshit online?)",

I got up and took off from the tail gate I was sitting at about 30 yards away, just as she was getting near an unlit, downward slope of the walkway back to the dorm. As I slowed down to a trot and got close, I made up a name and loudly greeted her, and then immediately lowered my voice (now that I was next to her) and explained what I had seen and asked her if she'd like me to finish her walk with her to her dorm. She gave a quick glance over her shoulder and then quietly agreed. We made small talk for the short rest of the walk, and I thought maybe I was just being paranoid, or too skeptical, until we got the front door of her dorm. As we stopped for her to swipe in and she quickly thanked me, the group of guys came around the corner a short distance away, saw us, stopped and pulled out their phones/ looked over shoulders, \"act normal\" type shit, then turned around and walked off a few seconds later. I still can't say for sure what their intentions were; maybe one just wanted her number or something, but I'll always err on the side of caution in situations like this.

As I approached the bottom of the stairs I accidentally scuffed my heel on the stair and the sound startled her. She gave a small yell and turned to look at me. I said I was sorry and continued walking to my dorm thinking nothing of it.\n\nA moment later she came running up to me and asked if I was walking to a particular dorm. I said yes, and she asked if she could walk with me. I said yes. I don't remember what we talked about as we walked. We got to the dorm and she went to her building and I went to mine.\n\nThe next day I mentioned this to my girlfriend and asked her why she was at one moment frightened of me, and the next moment she wanted to walk with me. She said the woman probably felt with my reaction of saying I was sorry, then walking on, not trying to hit on her reassured her and she felt comfort asking to walk with me, that I was not a danger.\n\nWhat my girlfriend told me taught me how oblivious I was to the dangers women face.",

I made it clear that I saw him and what was happening.\n\nSoon after, the lady was able to reverse, and get away from the guy, who then turned and stared at me.\n\nI didn't move. Didn't look away or break eye contact. \n\nHe left shortly after.\n\nI went back into the shop to collect my order, and just as I was waiting I heard the shop's phone ring.\n\nAs I was walking out of the door one of the staff called out to me and said there was a phone call for me?\n\nConfused, I took the phone.\n\nIt was the lady in the car.\n\nShe was crying, and said that she saw me standing there watching what was happening, and that she wanted to thank me for not ignoring the situation... That of all the \"men\" there, I was the only one who took notice and \"came to her aid\"... Not in the sense that I \"did\" anything, but that I didn't do nothing.\n\nShe told me that she wasn't as afraid when she noticed that I was watching what was happening.\n\nShe asked for my name and number in case she needed me as a witness for the police.\n\nIn this day and age, with the number of scams etc, and, having a family of my own, I was hesitant.\n\nI didn't know this person. Or the situation.\n\nWould I be opening myself up to a potential bad situation if the man harassing her found my details. What if this was some sort of scam?\n\nI want to believe people are inherently good, but our world tells us otherwise constantly.\n\nAfter a quick minute to think, I gave her my first name and number.\n\nThe next day I received a call from the police, and I gave my account of events.\n\nShortly after I received a text from the lady thanking me, and explained that she had taken out a restraining order against him, but he was violating it.\n\nI felt terrible for her, but content in myself that I didn't turn away when it would have been the easiest thing to do.\n\nA couple of years later, out of the blue, the lady messaged me again. \n\nShe asked me if I would send her son a message telling him about the encounter, as his father (the carpark guy), was trying to turn him against her, and asked if I would explain that that is not what a real man does... And that his father's actions are not what he should aspire to.\n\nTo tell him what I did, and that his father was not a good man.\n\nThis put me in a really difficult position. \n\nI agreed with her. But I was also very conflicted as to whether or not I should be getting so involved in their own private family situation.\n\nI told her how I felt, and she said that she knew it was a lot to ask, but that she felt that her ex was turning her son against her.\n\nI'm not a counsellor, nor any sort of family expert, so I declined, but I did some research, and pointed her towards some outlets that could offer her more material support for both her and her son.\n\nI don't know if I did the right thing or not. But it was all I could think to do at the time.\n\nGiven the chance again, now that I am older and \"wiser\", I would take the time to send that young boy a message.\n\nI actually tried messaging her number (as I kept the messages), but I got no response.\n\nBe aware of your ability to do good.\n\nMore now than ever.",

I was minding my own business looking through pictures on my phone when a woman latched onto my arm.  She and I were dressed as characters from the same series, and she called me by the characters name (fairly common thing to do).  Not sure if this will make sense, but she was acting drunk but didn't smell drunk.  Soon after a guy shows up, spots her, and starts making his way to us.  She grips my arm and says... something.  All I made out was \"don't\".  This guy says he's her \"boyfriend\".  Guy was like \"Hey buddy, sorry about that.  She's had too much to drink and needs to sleep it off.\"  Now, I've never had my arm in a vice before... but the way she crushed my arm when he spoke might be what that's like.  He tried getting her to go with him and I just kept talking to them, her really.  It felt off.  I noticed he didn't have a Con badge on, so I took her with me into the \"after-party\".  Guy wasn't allowed in since he didn't have a Con badge.\n\nI sit her down.  I probably looked bad getting her phone out of her bag.  I wasn't thinking.  Luckily, I just had to get her to look at her phone to unlock it.  I rambled off the names in her phone until she nodded at one.  I texted our location and waited.  Eventually, four women show up, get her and start smacking and insulting me before leaving with her.\n\nEither one or two days later I get tackled/hugged by Mary Marvel.  She thanked me for \"saving\" her that night.  I'm not sure I'd go that far.  Only one of her friends ever apologized since then.  Now, if she sees me at cons she runs up to me and tackles/hugs me.",

I’d just turned out of my street when I saw this young woman absolutely bolting down the road behind me and I noticed she was trying to get my attention. l pull over, and she hops straight into my passenger seat. I’m very confused but this poor girl looks absolutely manic and just tells me to keep driving. I try to calm her down a bit; I introduce myself, ask her name, ask her what was going on and reassure her that she’s safe now.\n\nShe’d been at her partner’s house and very suddenly got very bad vibes from the guy, was certain he was going to kill her, so she just ran out the front door. She didn’t even have her shoes on. She says she absolutely does not want to involve the police, I believe because they’d been smoking weed (it’s not legal here). I’m not 100% sure about this but she looked underaged, too.\n\nShe tells me she needs to call someone but my phone has no credit, so I take her to the shops which are only a few minutes away. We pull up at the bottle shop, I walk in with her and explain the situation to a cashier and ask if she can use their phone. The manager shows up, who’s thankfully a woman, and basically takes the entire situation off my hands. They take her to a back room to look after her.\n\nI think about her every now and again, and I hope she’s doing okay. No idea what happened after I left her with that manager. I don’t really have a point to this story, the question just reminded me of the whole thing and I wanted to share. Always check your rearview mirror, I guess.",

I told him that there weren't any beers in the wine racks he had been walking around and to purchase something and leave. Let the girls know they could stay for as long as they needed. About ten mins later they were thinking about leaving so I went out to sus whether the guy was still skulking about. Found him standing around the corner in our side carpark waiting in the dark.

Had to peel her away from the dog to realize that she was getting kidnapped, because she was too drunk and oblivious to know what was happening.  \n\nTook her inside to her room, where her parents took her in (I assume).\n\nSo I think to me it was obvious and I think in her little world she knew, but I couldn’t let her go out like that even though the puppy was cute.",

I appear intimidating to people who don't know me, but I'm a huge sci-fi lover, anime and gamer nerd. My ex was always a jealous and combative person.\n\nWe and some friends were out at a fair when a young lady runs up on me and wraps herself around my arm. Never saw this lady in my life. She says, \"There you are! I was looking all over for you baby!\" I was confused and a bit weirded out. I was about to tell her she had the wrong person but I saw she had \"help me\" look on her face. So I played the part asking her where she was at and all that.\n\nMy ex, thinking this was an actual side chick of mine, started getting loud, saying things \"Who's the fucks this bitch,\" \"He don't know you,\" \"You cheating on me\" etc. The lady strongly insisted that we were together, thus my ex started getting louder and getting really close to getting physical. The guy friend we were with was confused by the whole thing, but the girl friend realized what was going on. Right as my ex started putting her hands on the lady, the girl friend got in between and said that the lady was being followed by someone. My ex was still too pissed to listen but guy friend wised up and pulled her off. The moment he pulled her off, some dude rounded the corner and stared at the young lady who was still on my arm in a weird way. Dude looked at me and back at her several times before I spoke up and said, \"You good?\" He looked at me saying \"uhhh...\" and quickly walked away.\n\nWalked the girl to her car and she thanked me, saying the guy had approached her asking for her name and number. When she refused, saying she was with a boyfriend, he started the whole \"your man doesn't allow guy friends?\" spiel and proceeded to follow her around the fair.\n\nAfter she left, my ex, even after watching the entire exchange with the guy, was somehow still mad at her... and me(?) Her reasoning was she could have found someone else and how it hurt that I played along.",

Well, at least she thought that's how I looked.  The real hero was a woman who stepped in and calmed things down.\n\nIt was in a WalMart parking lot, and this tiny university girl got into an argument with a big intimidating looking bastard.   She was backing out of a parking space in front of his truck, and he jammed on his brakes and leaned on his horn, then he got out and started yelling at her for cutting him off.  His truck was stopped at least 2 car lengths away, he could have stopped 2 or 3 times more and still avoided hitting her, but he was acting like she had just backed right into him.  He was cursing and swearing, demanding her licence and insurance info, and she was on the verge of tears.  \n\nI tried to talk some sense into him, and he accused me of taking her side.  When I told him there was no side to take, he got even madder.  This guy was twice my size and mad as hell, and he was scaring me almost as bad as he had scared this girl.  Whenever I tried to reason with him, he seemed to get madder.  Then this woman (mid 40s) walked up and asked if everyone was okay, and he started going off again about everyone siding against him.  She then produced ID and identified herself as a cop out of uniform, and told him that he was ten seconds away from being arrested for criminal harassment if he didn't calm down.  She told him to go back to his truck and calm down, and she'd get his side of the story first.  By this time I was praying to gods I don't even believe in, so I was happy when he complied.\n\nI waited with the girl until the cop had finished talking to Mr. Ragemonster, then exhaled in relief when he quietly drove away.  The cop said that this guy had just had a week from hell, lost his business and his marriage within the past few days, and had finally just snapped under the pressure.  The girl gave me a hug and thanked me for \"protecting\" her, even though that guy could have snapped me in two with minimal effort if he had wanted.  \n\nShe and the cop complimented me for my bravery, even though I pointed out that it's hard to look macho while sweating and shaking in fear.  The girl then quoted Game Of Thrones, saying scared is the only time a person can be brave.  I'll be honest though, I didn't feel very brave at the time.",

He proceeded to follow me to my train stop and started telling me some story. I was so panicked I made I eye contact with a man walking toward me and mouthed “help me”.\n\nHe figured out where the man was sitting and yelled out, “HEY! IS THIS YOUR STUFF?!” The homeless man turned back and and said something. I ran as soon as he got distracted.\n\nThe other time was when I lived in LA about 4 years ago.\n\nI worked from home then and would walk my dog mid-afternoon to break up my day. There was a homeless man there that I would see regularly and didn’t think anything of it (it’s LA).\n\nOne day I noticed that he suddenly started walking in my direction. I didn’t really make anything of it until I noticed that he was inching closer and closer (started about 20 ft behind me but was gradually closing the gap), and would stop when I did.\n\nOnce I realized he was following me I picked up the pace but didn’t want to run in case I triggered a worse response from him. I walked to an intersection where the light was turning yellow and speed-walked across the crosswalk so he’d be interrupted by traffic. Luckily he didn’t try to jump in front of moving cars.\n\nOnce I got to the other side of the street I walked back toward my apt so that I could sneak back in. I knew I only had a few mins to get away before Homeless Man would backtrack.\n\nAs I was walking back, some guy on the sidewalk says, “Hey, you’re being followed.”\n\n“I know,” I say. “Can you talk to me like you know me please?”\n\nSidewalk Guy asked me a few basic questions like “Where are you from? You look like you speak Spanish” or something like that (I don’t really remember).\n\nOnce I felt Homeless Man had lost interest, I quickly thanked Sidewalk Guy and went home.\n\nGod bless those two men that stepped in.

I heard someone giving what sounded like a speech so I ran in that direction and found a big meeting of some kind taking place.  I ran into the room, sat in the first empty chair I found.  The room got super quiet, and it was all women.  They were staring at me! Then the men walked in and all eyes in unison turned to them. Awkward silence.  One of the men said “Praise God!”.  More awkward silence.  They turned and left. I burst into tears, and was promptly comforted by all the ladies around me.  I explained what had happened.  Turns out It was a League of Women Voters meeting, and the seat I had landed in was the president of the organization, who had been giving the speech.  She wound up driving me home that night. I have never forgotten the kindness of all those women.  I also look back on the experience and laugh a little.  So to answer OP, I would help the girl or woman, and have on occasion.

I am not going to lie, my first reaction was I being set up for a prank or something. Then I looked passed them and saw a guy probably in in late 40s, dishevelled, staring straight at them, then me, then back at them etc and I put it together. \n\nI was supposed to get off at Main Street but that was where he got off so I stayed with them til Burrard, wished them a goodnight and doubled back.

After the show, they are walking to the subway to begin the very long trek home (think about an hour by train) when they realize they are being followed by a group of guys.  They were getting close to the subway entrance when they realize it was very deserted down there.  They were passing a hotel with one of those canopied entrances and there was a car/limo sitting at the curb and a distinguished man was exiting the hotel and approaching the car.  My cousin recognized him and ran up to him and started gushing \"Oh Mr. O'Neal there you are we couldn't remember the name of the hotel!\" and stuff like this, her friends caught on and were crowding around and talking all at once. My cousin whispers to him that these guys were following them and could he take them to the next block to get the subway there?  He put his arms around them and starts chatting and loads them into his limo.  Once in there he calls my uncle and tells him what happened and that he was bringing the girls home... drove all of them to their own homes and dropped them off to make sure they were safe.",

So I had gotten seriously into bodybuilding when I was in university. I had just finished doing my workout routine before the party and now I was wearing my friend’s ugly sweater that was tight in all the right places. When I saw what the other guys there were doing to her I didn’t even have to say anything to them. I just flexed my arms and pectorals and waved my finger at them (besiacy saying non verbally “you won’t like what happens next”) and they left her alone. \n\nWe separated eventually for like 20 or 30 minutes and I went out into the yard (it was a big frat house with only a few bathrooms) to take a leak and I turned around and she’s standing behind me shivering in her mini skirt and strapless top in single digit temperatures because she’s terrified of being alone in the building. I learned that night that some of my friends were assholes. In vino veritas, right? I remember one of them saying to me “dude that girl’s gonna get raped.” And so she and I stayed within eyeshot of each other for the rest of the night. I don’t even remember her name.

My friend and I were headed out for a drunken 1 am 7/11 run when a girl comes up to us and says there are a group of guys from a fraternity party she just left following her. Sure enough there was a crowd of guys trailing about a block back. \n\nMy friend offered her his arm and jumped into the situation so confidently that I couldn't believe it. She grabbed my arm because she was freaking out. She was clearly messed up. We fast walked for blocks before we lost the group. She asked if she could come back to the apartment and call someone. So we brought her to my friends apartment where his 5 other roommates were sleeping. \n\nShe proceeded to tell us about her night but it was difficult to get a clear story. She called a guy in Dallas to pick her up and that guy was like \"no way I'm in Dallas.\" Very reasonable considering we were in Austin and it was 1 am. My friend said she could crash on the couch if she needed to. She spent the next 30 minutes telling us about how this frat was bull shit and that her dad was gonna buy them and buy UT and sell it which would show them. Then my buddy held her hair while she vomited. She crashed on the couch and the only trace of her the next morning was one of her shoes that she left in the living room.",

Ok good, then I'll sit here, because we gotta plan the next ritual.\" It's fun watching the guy start looking nervous.\n\nMost recently, I was at a lifestyle bar a few weeks ago and this guy kept following me and outright cornering me anytime I wasn't in a group of people. So after my friends left, I randomly inserted myself into a group I had seen chatting with one of my friends. The big guy in the group saw me nervously looking back towards the bar and he'd actually noticed the creeper earlier. He totally understood the assignment. As did my husband who flat out told the guy \"yeah, she's not into you pal\" after distracting him long enough for me to embed myself in the group.\n\n(I will likely not be going back there because of him, TBH.)\n\nBonus, I now have a new friend!",

She started crying immediately as she started releasing anxiety.. it was really sad.\n\nWe said ofcourse you can and we started comforting  her, especially my wife. Almost immediately a guy walks by and yell \"fuck you bitch I didn't do shit\", or something along this line.  He walked in a quick pace. \n\nSo we bought her a tea and tried to calm her down further. Then we talked about getting her home safely. It was decided that my wife and baby would stay at the coffeeshop and I would escort her home.\n\nShe said thanks and that was it, no debriefing no pleasantries.

I was 30 y/o male at the time and quite rough looking because I'm a bit of a degenerate but love walking. Anyway 2 young boys came running up from behind yelling 'excuse me sir... excuse me sir..' and at first I didn't think it was directed at me - I tend to ignore people on walks as much as possible. I didn't look back. 'excuse me sir... sob... please sir help us' They were getting close. They must be talking to me and they sounded panic'd so I couldn't ignore them. 'Hey guys what's going on' I said as I stopped and looked at them. 'Sir there's a man chasing us... please help.. we're afraid of him' The boys looked to be between 7-10y/o and had no injuries... they were just scared, clingy and desperate. 'Oh a man's following you two is he?' I looked back along the track watching and waiting. 'Why's this man after you boys?' 'We don't know... he just came running after us yelling at us' I was suspicious and knew more likely the boys were messing around. Then an older man appeared down the track where the boys came running from. 'Is that him?' I asked 'Yes' they said. 'Hello Hi' waved the oncoming man huffing and puffing toward us 'Those boys, we...' I pulled out my phone and started pretend dialing the police 'I'm on the phone with the Police mate so bugger off' 'No it's just...' 'Start walking away from him boys' I said as together we continued along the pathway away from the man. 'Just wait... let's talk..' I heard him say but I had no idea what was going on other than these boys were afraid of this older man so there'd be nothing other than me getting these boys away from him. 'Rack off mate, go scare a mirror instead.' I yelled back with my phone to my ear. The man did stop following then and returned back to where-ever he came from. To be honest I got the vibe that the boys might have been messing with this dude and he was gonna give em a smack or something from first contact... that's why I fake dialed the Police. He wasn't running toward us or looking overly threatening (and as it's Australia 99.9% sure no gun). He never got closer than 20 meters. I put my phone away and asked where the kids lived so I could walk them home then asked what really caused the other bloke to lose his marbles. The kids did confess to being a bit noisy in front of the guys house - but I couldn't get anything more definite. I walked the kids home  avoiding the house the kids said the man came from, I asked the kids to please tell their parents about the man and avoid him from now on, then I wished them all the best for the rest of their school holidays. \n\nThe fact they knew where the man lived gave me some confidence this was probably just a man who lost his temper with some brats than anything more nefarious. Probably been listening to screaming the whole holidays and told them to shut up or something. Got a smart ass reply then got grabby possibly to demand they take him to their parents or something... I dunno - maybe I should have went to the kids parents, introduced myself and explained what happened but... I just didn't - I just wanted to get the kids to their home, tell them to talk to their parents about this then be on my way. Basically make this not my issue anymore - like I said I'm a degenerate. Anyway I wont ramble. Just thought my experience was relevant for this question thread.\n\nTLDR: I told the follower to rack off, had my phone out and was calling the Police. I wasn't prepared to listen to any of their bullshit and told them they're scaring someone so rack off. I was being loud to try and attract attention.",

She slurred out something about losing her friends, helping her get a taxi and that she felt ill. \n\nThe guy got really aggressive and hands on, trying to lead her away from us. My wife cottoned on straight away and manoeuvred her so that I was between the guy and them both. His aggression suddenly skyrocketed and his friend who had been stood nearby watching also joined the group. Both were relatively big guys, so I'm thinking fuck. I'm taking an ass kicking here but I'm not about to let them take the young woman so I just thought fuck it and accepted my fate 🤣 It got pretty heated until the bar staff told the bouncer it was all about to kick off. They were removed from the bar but we could see them hanging around outside.\n\nMy wife had got the girl some water but she was progressively getting more disoriented. We decided to try and get her home. As we left the bar the two guys were still outside and looked like they were waiting for us. Luckily a police car came down the street and they made themselves scarce. \n\nWe got her into a taxi and luckily she had a drivers licence in her bag because she was out cold. Got her home and had to carry her inside. Her parents were shocked and couldn't thank us enough, saying she never gets this drunk. We left our numbers so they could let us know she was okay. Turns out she only had three drinks, lost her friends and one of the guys had bought her a drink. It's all a blur after that. I regularly have a beer with her dad now and we've became good friends. \n\nI fully believe she was either being raped or trafficked(both probs) if someone hadn't stepped in.

Anyway we began walking before engaging them, trying to get closer to the bus station near by, basically into a more crowded area, long and short they got loud with me, I just got threatening to them and they eventually backed down (thankfully), I warned them if they touch her or bother her again the \"whole family\" (which don't exist) would smash every bone in their body and then some.

Thought I'd get myself home so I went to a bus stop. A young couple was there, discussing something outside one of the sheds. I sat down in the closest of the two sheds minding my own business.\n\nSuddenly the guy started arguing with me, told me I could not sit there. The girl tried to intervene (with him) and a three way argument broke out. (This was non-occupied bench in a bus shed, ofc I could sit there at 3am).\n\nAnyway, agrgument got heated and there was about to be a fight between me and the guy (I never fight, not my thing). But the girl steps up.. 2 inches from my face. Just saying \"Please, go\". And I immediately obeyed with a sheep'ish \"Ok.\"\nI went to sit in the next shed, just two metres away.\n\nSo yeh, you girl in Norway! Good luck with that relationship.",

Some huge dude with a side arm on his hip in a used military hum-v walked up to my car as my husband was on speaker phone. Im a veteran so I knew he wasn’t in the military. I’m panicking wanting to throw myself into traffic if necessary. I barely crack my window and he asked if I needed help. I said my husband was minutes away and all I can hear through the speaker phone was his truck engine roaring. He stayed parked behind me, but I said the hell with the warning on my car and got away. Scared the hell out of me. I now conceal carry.\n\nI have other similar stories, but it’s always so shocking that the frequency of these incidents were really high. It’s scary being a woman in this world at times. The few men who’ve stepped into help are literally heroes who rarely get praise bc we are panicked and just go into survival mode.

She was being very heavily harassed by the local drunk who was telling her how much his son fancies her and what he would like to do to her. I signalled over to the team leader to call my work phone and when answered it told my colleague the manager needed to see her in the office and I'll look after her self scans for her. When she walked past me I told her to go on break for as long as she wanted as it was quiet and I could manage them all. \n\nNot going to lie, I was quite proud of myself for this and felt I had done the right thing.

Figured out it was the latter. Drank my shot. Pretended to stumble upon her presence. Faked a big huge smile and said “Omg, I haven’t seen you in forever” and put my arms out for a hug. She looked hella confused (how many of us have made some bar friends that we couldn’t pick out a line up lol) but went in for the hug. At which point I whispered in her ear “you don’t know me but you look really uncomfortable are you okay”. I felt her body relax as she began to thank me profusely. Just told her to pretend we know each other and we proceeded to converse until the creep meandered away.\n\nMoral of the story, they don’t always come up to you.

The first time I was 12 and walking to a friends house in my neighborhood, when some creepy guy drove by, slowed down and asked me to get in his car. I said no thank you and he drove off but kept circling back and getting more and more agitated. So I went to the nearest house and knocked on the door where a man and his wife let me in and called my parents to pick me up. I had somewhat of an understanding of the danger but the full weight of it didn’t hit me until I was older, and I’m grateful to that couple for not turning me away. \n\nThe second time I was 19 and very pregnant, when a guy that had been on and off stalking me since I was 14 and he was 18 came into my work.  It was obvious he was on drugs and he was really angry that I didn’t recognize him (in the 2 years since I’d last seen him he had dropped a ton of weight and almost looked emaciated, didn’t look like the same person and I was helping him until he demanded to know if I knew who he was). After that he kept coming back daily and even walked by the window waving a knife one day. My boss called the police but they wouldn’t do anything. Well one day the UPS man came in with his twice weekly delivery as we were talking about all the crazy stuff the guy had done over the years and asked me to point him out if he was ever around at the same time that he was making a delivery. About a week later, they both showed up at the same time so I pointed him out and asked UPS man not to put himself in an unsafe situation or risk his job, but I’d appreciate him backing me up if I needed to try to make a police report again. \n\nDude walked right up to mr. stalky mcstalkerson and said something like “see that lady over there? She’s a sweetheart and I don’t mind losing my job or going to jail. Make sure you look both ways before crossing the street when you gtfo of here, bud.” \n\nThat man was my hero and I baked him cookies and cupcakes for the rest of my time working there. Oh, and homeboy disappeared off the face of the earth. I doubt one guy swayed him, hell police calling him and telling him to back off when I was a teenager didn’t do the trick. So I assume he either went to jail for drug related stuff or maybe died. It probably sounds cold hearted, but I don’t care either way. That dude put me through hell and I’m glad I’ve never seen him again.",

I made eye contact with him and held it, while smiling and replying loud enough to be clearly heard, “thanks for meeting me, love, what can I get you?” I physically stood between her and the man, and maintained eye contact with him as he ambled down the sidewalk. His steps slowed and he just stood there holding his pile of bags/clothing/stuff, then he broke eye contact, turned and crossed the street.

Before I can react I'm punched in the temple. I stumble. It had been raining and the pavement was slippery. While I try to regain balance and see whoever punched me, the girl kicks me below the knee in a way I fall flat on my stomach. She's yelling something like\n\n* no te metai con mi pololo él me puede hacer lo que quiera ya?\n\n(don't mess with my boyfriend, he can do with me as he pleases, ok?)\n\nIn this situation, other people see their inner dragon light up. Their inner lion roaring. It seems my totem animal is a baboon because I crawl, jump, stumble, and eventually run my ass out of there.  Still hear her yelling. The boyfriend is not really chasing me.
