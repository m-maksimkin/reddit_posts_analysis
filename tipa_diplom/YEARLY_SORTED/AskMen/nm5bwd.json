The last 500m is torture, but it gets easier every day.\nI feel so much better in every way, especially mentally: Self-loathing and stagnation feelings were replaced by being impressed with myself and noticing how much better I look.

Everyone else notices, too - which helps self-confidence.\n\nLess joint pain, easily moving around and crouching without discomfort. Driving is more comfortable because the seat belt doesn't cut into my gut. I sleep better, snore less, make my Wife MUCH happier. Physical exertion is more effortless with faster recovery.

            "text": "I lost 100 pounds in my late teenage years over 2 years (down 280 -> 180). I was able to accomplish it via intermittent fasting, keto, OMAD, HIIT... largely before these \"technologies\" were common practice. A decade later I've gone up to as much as 215 but mostly through gaining muscle and focusing my efforts at the gym. I'm sitting now at a pretty 195, and I'm quite lean. I've noticed a lot of really positive changes over the years, but I want to highlight that weight loss in and of itself is definitely not a cure-all for your problems.\n\nBenefits I noticed:\n\n* Weight loss can be a self-confidence booster (to a degree)\n* Joints generally hurt less\n* Increased agility & reflexes\n* Women show more interest (probably related to self-confidence booster)\n* Taught me that I am ambitious and goal-oriented, and that I can do hard stuff\n* Taught me that I have control over my destiny, which has vastly improved my career\n* Sleep apnea is better, but not cured unlike some. I now only have mild, whereas before I had severe.\n\nPotential drawbacks to note: \n\n* Stretch marks and loose belly fat/skin will never go away\n* I will have constant arthritis and pain for the rest of my life because of the punishment my knees and ankles went through as a big dude, and the workouts I did to become a lean dude\n* Weight loss itself does not cure self-confidence and self-esteem issues like I thought it would\n* Weight loss itself does not improve relations with women, only confidence does (still working on that)\n* I need to closely monitor my intake, otherwise my body packs on pounds like nobody's business\n* Eating whatever I want, whenever I want, is still not possible (people in my situation don't have ideal genetics/metabolism for that)\n* I still need a CPAP machine to sleep through the night without apnea. It's honestly embarrassing, frustrating (constant maintenance/cleaning, tubes are annoying), and disincentivizes me from traveling since I need to take it with me. Also, forget about camping.\n* I still don't feel \"comfortable\" with my weight, and always want to trim down (yet the plateaus are impossible to overcome now without drugs or excessive effort).\n\nWould I do it again? Absolutely. I feel like I actually have a shot at a \"normal, healthy life\" now. My main problem is, I lost years on my social/dating life to insecurity and crushed self-esteem. I'd recommend anyone going through a weight loss transformation to get a psychologist or therapist in your corner during and after the process. While the physical got better during my transformation, the psychological lagged behind majorly. \n\nPeople ask me these days why I don't have a girlfriend because \"I'm such a great guy and so attractive\". Why? It's 100% my mentality. Instead of hating on myself to stop being a fat, sad piece of shit (which doesn't make any sense anymore), I should be thinking of myself in a totally different light. I did more than most people could ever do to transform their body and their life. Yet my emotions and mentality need to catch up. They are, slowly :)",

If I start slacking for a couple of days, I feel a noticeable difference in energy levels and get fatigued easier.\n* It is exceptionally easier to get around and participate in group activities. I would get winded going up stairs, was slow, and would slow groups down if there was a lot of movement involved.\n* Related to the above, after becoming consistent with exercise, it is very freeing to know that whatever physical activities come up, I can handle it. I remember actually being excited helping someone move and literally running around carrying boxes just because I had the energy and ability to do so.\n* There are SOOOO many more clothing options. Before, I basically was relegated to only wearing what I could find that fit. I would have to go to multiple different stores to find maybe one or two articles of clothing. I literally cried with happiness when I started fitting into \"normal\" people sizes.\n* Dick \"appears\" bigger just due to the rest of me being smaller, and less fat around the pubic area.\n* When I was closer to 200 lbs I was training for kickboxing fights then, and at the later stages of weight cuts I would get cold VERY easily. I was literally wearing sweatshirts mid-summer because I was always cold.\n* Losing the weight doesn't automatically make you get out of the \"fat guy\" mentality. I was very morbidly obese from 11 to my late 20s. Even at my fight weight, I felt like I was too big, needed to lose more, tried not to stand out in a crowd, etc. This is despite the fact that I was more physically fit and capable that most people at that time.\n* Somewhat related to the above, loose skin from excessive weight loss after being obese for so long SUCKS. Even though I was/am at relatively healthy weights, physically fit, and eat well I have massive amounts of hanging skin with pockets of fat at the bottoms of the hangs. It really hurts my self-image, and is very hard to get over. Surgery would cost \\~$35k and almost no insurance in the US will cover any of it.",

I can just get up and do stuff without really feeling that I am putting any effort. This applies to \\*everything\\*. Even just something like getting up and feeding my dogs or making coffee or doing the laundry or making the bed just feels so much easier. Let alone something like commuting to work, or walking to the library, or other activities such as that.

I lost a whole bunch of weight, but hurt stuff and had random things crop up that crashed my energy, so without all the exercise I regained all my lost weight and a bit extra. All from problems developed pretty much AFTER I'd lost weight. \n\nSome types of sleep apnea go away after losing weight, sometimes it doesn't fix anything.\n\nSo the most important thing is to make sure you have the right reasons because plenty of the benefits you get from being lower weight are subtle and aren't amazing like shown in a glitzy pic on reddit where everyone thinks it's all wonderful now that you've lost weight!",

Being fat makes you feel like garbage all the time and it’s hard to realize without losing it all.\n- Not having to work extra hard to dry the skin under folds after a shower.\n- Thighs and balls not constantly sticking/rubbing together.\n- Looking at the mirror and pictures of your healthy self and being happy with how you look. (Yes you should always be happy with yourself but I’m just saying)\n- Speed. If you’re into sports, you’ll almost certainly be faster just from the lack of carrying around an extra 50. \n- Not breaking chairs or creaking floorboards. This goes with lighter feet. It’s nice to be able to be sneaky.\n- After you hit a goal, maintaining the weight you can still eat basically whatever as long as you do it in moderation and keep up with exercise.\n- Wife not wanting to sleep on your chest because “it isn’t soft anymore”. Still cuddle, but when it’s time to go to sleep, you may do so in peace. \n- This might be harsh but significant other will almost certainly be more physically attracted and “driven”. \n- You’re feet won’t hurt after walking around for 20 minutes.\n- Being overweight I always wake up with terrible morning breath and bad taste in my mouth.

After that, no matter where I went, people who knew me treated me almost like a celebrity. They'd want to talk to me for 30-45 minutes about the weightloss. They would like beam with happiness just standing next to me. Want to take pictures with me. Honestly, everyday kinda felt like a high school graduation, because people just wanted to celebrate my accomplishment. And they'd ask my advice and look up to me as a wise expert on the topic, everyone just wanted to be on board with what I was doing. People I hadn't spoken to in years, would reach out to me on social media. Family/friends members would send me pictures of them exercising and eating right. It was such an overall positive thing for my self-esteem.\n\nThe weird thing is that even people I didn't know while I was obese, treated me differently than I had ever been treated before. People were just much nicer and welcoming and friendlier with me. I wasn't excluded from a lot of things I had been before. People would invite me to more activities and outings, than ever before. Like you get an instant popularity and respect by being in shape, that I had never experienced. And people were overall a lot nicer and more understanding and generous. Before people were much quicker to scold me for my mistakes or demand things of me or assume I had tons of free time to waste helping them with things that weren't my responsibility. But afterwards it almost seemed like people appreciated time/effort I was giving them. Like on some unconscious level, they would look at me and think \"this guy has so much better things he could be doing with his time. He should be out there living life. I should be grateful he's here instead\". It was a very weird thing to adjust to at first. Even with my close friends, me spending time with them stopped feeling like just hanging out or more like me making a \"special appearance\". There is so much more but its really hard to put some of it into words tbh\n\nAlso not having to worry about breaking stuff by sitting on it. Not worrying about taking up too much space in public areas. Being able to buy clothes at normal stores. Being able to buy cool looking fashionable clothes. Not living with constant joint and back pain. Being able to participate in an active lifestyle, like biking/hiking/running. Not being tired all the time. Feeling accepted in whatever crowd I ended up in. Being able to take your shirt off for the pool/beach without being ashamed. Sex is overall better in every way possible. You mental/emotional health increase as well. You look and feel younger. You're more alert and focused. And you can do amazing thing that you never dreamed possible before, like running a marathon or hitting your goals at the gym. \n\nAlso you add about 10 years or so to your life expectancy at least, especially if you go from morbidly obese to a fit weight. So that gives you an extra 10 years to figure your life out. And your years will be healthier and happier. So you can prettier much turn your age back a decade and just enjoy it to the fullest, like a do over to make up for the time you've wasted. Except now your older, wiser, more attractive, more confident, more energetic, more stable, and happier. If you're feeling old, getting in shape is pretty much the only thing you can do to reverse that really.",

And not just romantically speaking, even professionally. Admittedly I’m not sure if it was because of the actual weight loss, or if it was because I carried myself differently and dressed better, etc. But it was very noticeable. \n\n- I don’t think it can be overstated how great it was to start wearing clothes from brands that would’ve never fit me before. \n\n- I personally found much more comfort when it came to just walking around and being in public. While it wasn’t constant, when I was 300+, I would definitely catch people staring at me at times and it made me feel pretty crappy. So I think dropping weight allowed me to blend in abit better, which was a nice change. \n\nUltimately, I find it almost difficult to really put a list together. I personally found that my life really did improve across the board as a result of my weight-loss.

Firstly, I had a crust of dried, sore skin on my heels that was constantly flaking. I also went down 1 shoe size. Also easier to clean, and clip my nails. I even got a pedicure the other week because I wasn't so ashamed of my feet anymore. \n\nMy skin health. I have a nice tan and I'm not constantly pale and red. It's healthier and smoother. My acne cleared up everywhere. The skin is saggy in places, though, and it does make me self conscious. My stomach has a deep middle hang it didn't have before. My thigh chub doesn't rub together anymore. \n\nDick gains, obviously. I went from maybe 3 or 4 inches to a solid 6 inches. I maintain a stronger erection and can do way more during sex and in far more positions. No more gut to block me from half of the most enjoyable things during sex. Oh, and I can lift my fiancee now. \n\nMy beard looks a little thicker and grows better without all that chin fat. However, I've got some regular old male pattern baldness going on due to genetics and just started hair treatment 2 weeks ago. So that's another thing: you start noticing other features of yourself and working on them. I use stuff on my eye bags, my cuticles, my stretch marks. I take vitamins. I have my first dentist appointment in years. The fog of shame and fear lifts more every day, and I'm no longer afraid of the things I used to be. \n\nMuscle fluctuates a lot without proper consistency, which is hard on a diet. And it only gets harder on the way down. I just dropped back down from 1800kcal to 1200kcal after a plateau. \n\nI'm still depressed, make no mistake, but I feel like I can take it on how. My body feels healthier and leaner. Chairs don't creak under me. I'm more confident. Life is good now, and I'm no longer listening to songs about how the glory days are gone, I'm not living as if it'll never get better anymore. I got into grad school. I got a new job. So yeah.

            "text": "There are a number of benefits to losing weight, and eating a balanced diet.  I'm not a fan of vegetarian, or vegan (I like my meat, although I don't consume as much as I did, and I have a \"sweet tooth\"), and I  would warn against keto; it may throw your body's  balances off, and and \"fad diets\" should be done with your doctor's approval, and supervision.  I had a weight problem, too; with stress at work, which didn't help (incidentally, I saw an article not too long ago, that stress may be a factor in causing Arthritis;  we already know that stress causes high blood pressure, GERD (Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease, stresses the heart, and other organs; and who knows  how many other maladies.  Just try though, to get Workers' Compensation for these conditions; Carpal Tunnel, and Repetitive Motion injuries are now recognized as workplace injuries, but it took years, and years of court fights, and legislative battles, to get it done).  As far as diet and exercise, I would suggest a balanced diet; and set up an exercise program for yourself, based on the four original Aerobics books written by Dr. Kenneth Cooper, one with the help of his wife, Millie.  Dr. Cooper was a doctor in the U. S. Air Force, specializing in physical fitness, and it was his job to get new recruits into shape, including most of them to lose some weight; and to examine airmen, and certify their fitness to fly.  Dr. Cooper, in this capacity, and later in private practice; developed a program based on fitness, as based on the body's ability to take in oxygen, process it, and transport it to all the living cells in the body, incidentally including the body processing nutrients, and getting rid of waste.  He called his program Aerobics, which the Air Force adopted as its official exercise program; and later was adopted by the U. S. Navy; and the Royal Canadian Air Force.  I first read about Aerobics, in a Reader's Digest article back in the 1960's; and a little later, bought \"Aerobics\", the \"New Aerobics\" and \"The Aerobics Way\" (the book he co-authored with Millie, was \"Aerobics for Women\"). All were excellent books, and complemented each other.\nDr. Cooper's thesis was that the entire body, while performing different functions, is dependent on the lungs, heart, and circulatory system, as a delivery system to deliver oxygen, nutrients, and water; to the cells, then to carry away waste to the kidneys, for elimination through the urine.  Likewise, food and liquid taken in, is processed, beginning in the mouth, passes through the digestive system, is processed, nutrients and liquid absorbed, and indigestible material sent on to the large colon, for final processing, then elimination.  Exercise makes these processes work better, and more efficiently, as well as strengthening them, and the muscles.  Dr. Cooper  also felt that exercise should be done under a doctor's supervision, if at all possible, is best done if the exercise is enjoyable, which encourages the individual to continue it, but also done in a way that doesn't stress the body beyond its ability to repair itself (not to complete exhaustion, or damaging the muscles (no \"feeling the burn\").  As a result, he developed a program using a point system, involving several exercises, with the most important being those exercises that raise the individual to an increased level of oxygen intake, and processing, and requires the body to stay at that level, for a period of time.  He was a runner, and recommended that, along with walking; with swimming, and bicycling, in that order, as the best exercises, but included other activities, as well.  He set 30 points a week, after working up to that level, as a fitness maintenance level, and while there is nothing to prevent individuals from earning more points than that, he felt that at 30 points or more, the individual could consider themselves physically fit.  I would add, that while this addresses the delivery system; exercising the muscles further, for strength, and addressing muscles not fully exercised in the individual during their regular exercise, is desirable; so I would suggest calisthenics, weight lifting, and similar supplemental exercise.  I have found this to be a very good exercise regimen, and recommend it.\nAs for weight, I have found the Body-Mass Index to be a very good tool.  The ideal is somewhere between 22, and 25, with 25 to 30 indicating being overweight, and various obesity levels, beyond 30 (see, Body-Mass Index;  BMI= weight (metric, kilograms)/ height, squared (metric, meters)).",

And B) I'm possibly a bit bzzd and this now seems a lot longer then I ever intended or needed to write for this particular topic!\n\nHere's something I learned the hard way; if you are losing a lot of weight quickly without changing anything (diet, exercise, portions, fasting, etc.) go see your doctor. \n\nI'm a short man, only 5'6\" and at my most weighed 222. Lowest as an adult was 142 after basic training. I had found my sweet spot was about 165. Oh, the 222 was my most recent weight before I started losing.\n\nMid 2019 found out I was getting laid off from my job of 20+ years, company was being sold. I wasn't too stressed because I got hired a month later by the company that made the purchase. Unfortunately said company decided to release me during my probationary period and now I was panicked and started to lose weight quick. I wrote it up as stress for the first month or two but then got a job right at the end of the 2019 and thought everything was going to go back to normal! Yay! \n\n3 months into the new job lockdown hits and I'm working remote at a job I barely even know. Luckily things are good and I'm still with the company 1.5 years later. Weight still dropping though. Go see the doc finally once insurance kicks in. Blood work comes back saying I have diabetes and it's super jacked, like double what it should be for fasting. Doc says I should be walking out of his office with insulin but since he's just as surprised as me he puts me on a strong dose of a different med. \n\nI had dropped over 50 pounds the first 2 months and kept losing another 2 to 5 per month.

I've always been a lean athletic guy, at times incredibly fit. I was also a drinker for 10 years to varying degrees. I finally quit alcohol. However I wasn't gaining any weight and it was frustrating as I was about 145 pounds and I just couldnt gain a damn pound. So I turned to soda. Soda has been there for me to get some extra meat, coupled with high protein diets. The last 25 pounds came from the last year. I am about 215lbs now. Now I have paid a lot of attention to my body during this time. I dont look fat really at all. I just filled out and kinda look like an iron worker with a heathy diet. \nI have been having severely painful fully sore legs for months. I was going to get tested for RA because my joints hurt so bad. Until I started doing manual labor again and started rebuking again. I realized the problem. All that extra weight hurt my supporting part of my body. I'm talking almost collapsing when I got out of bed. At first I summed it up from skating for about 16+ years and a lot of fighting and injuries. That isnt the case. It's that I have all this extra weight. When I got on my beautiful road bike again(I truly cherish it) I was like whoa, this seat is up too high. It wasnt, my stomach diameter increased, the bending over was uncomfortable because i was more top heavy. My legs after a few miles were screaming \"fucking kill me\" and i just kept going. I'm gonna plan on continuing my rising again and quit the soda for the summer. I wait soda almost 2 years ago for a month. In two weeks I lost over 20 pounds. My body just feels heavier. Like when you jump on a trampoline for a while and then you get off and try to jump, that's me. So all you skinny athletic guys out there know that if you wanna gain weight do it with muscle over time because it fucking hurts. \nI lost 5 pounds riding yesterday and shitting my brains out from my body ramping up my metabolism. Really lifted some of the burden. Lol. My toilet was like \"share the load\" like samwise gamgee.\nJust my 2 cents.",

So I bit the bullet and started running again. I have a fast metabolism which was reinforced by the fact that the weight just fell off effortlessly (well not quite effortlessly, I was jogging 3 to 6 times per week since October) relatively speaking - that is, I eat probably MORE than I used to and still can’t gain the weight back because I am burning calories running all the time. Anyways the point is, my circulation feels much better than it did, chest cramps are diminished and over sweating is reduced. Like it or not, I’m healthier without the Dad bod so unfortunately I’ve chosen to prioritize my long term health by continuing to jog abundantly at the price of my cherished Dad bod.\n\nFor those who will puzzle over my symptoms or whatever, I’m 32 years old weigh about 185 lbs now down from about 225 lbs in October, I jog usually 3 times a week but longer distances than I did earlier when it was more like 5 or 6 times per week, and my mental energy levels are way way higher than they had been in years before I reintroduced regular cardiovascular exercise into my lifestyle again.",

While I’m still 380, being over 500 at my biggest, it gives me hope. I’m constantly buying new clothes. For the first time in over 15 years I was able to go into a Walmart and find something to wear. It honestly made me cry. It’s a hard road to walk. There times I slip up off my diet, and at first I was hard on myself, now I just take it in stride. There was a time even walking to the car winded me. Now I can walk without winding myself. I get out go fishing, walking my old blind and deaf dog and so on. I don’t even look at mowing the yard as a chore, I actually enjoy it so much I mow my neighbors lawn. My acid reflux isn’t an issue anymore, no longer using a cpap machine when I sleep. One of the downsides for me is the excessive amount of skin that’s just hangs. It has caused my shower routine to be a little longer washing, but that’s something worth trading off.

I normally don’t have issues being hot at night I’m cozy under blankets when I was at 212 I couldent bare having a blanket or I would be sweating all night long thru my clothing.  This was the biggest change for me was body sweat I would catch myself having moist armpits or a wet forehead chest etc just walking around not feeling hot or even exerting myself I just always felt slightly clammy and sweaty. \n\nFatigue. I’m sure this has a lot more to do with what I was eating take out delivery etc more than the weight itself and not healthy foods like I normally do but I felt tired all the time and after I ate I felt like thanksgiving every time I just wanted to nap and sit down. Every meal felt like a 2pm meal whwre you just feel so tired and sleepy after. \n\nThat’s really all I felt personally not anything drastic but coming back down to my regular weight and eating habits my sleep is back to normal and energy levels and I’m not sweating nonstop randomly.",

I was about 40lbs over weight at my heaviest (so probably not “significant” compared to someone 100lbs over weight), but I definitely gained a whole host of benefits, but again, not sure why ones people don’t talk about. Here they are:\n\nImproved posture. We are alway under the pressure of gravity, and when you are over weight, that extra weight not only adds more to your frame, but also pulls you out of natural skeletal alignment. If you have a big belly, that belly literally becomes a weight in front of your mid section, constantly pulling your lower back out of alignment. Your lumbar overcompensates for the extra weight, which makes your upper spine overcompensate with more extreme curves, which makes your neck tilt forward, giving you constant forward head syndrome. \n\nThis distortion of your alignment is significant, because it not only messes up muscular imbalance, but also displaces internal organs. Breathing becomes harder, because your diaphragm has lowered. Your abdominal muscles become slack, resulting in less pressure on your digestive system to function properly... \n\nWhen you look at this from a holistic perspective, beyond all the typical benefits that people talk about such as lower cholesterol, greater energy etc. the improved alignment significantly improves the overall function of the body. People with IBS find greater improvement, because their digestive system functions better due to the increase tautness of the abdominal wall, and the correct pressure it ups on the stomach. Breathing becomes better, because the diaphragm is positioned correctly. Shoulder pain and headaches often improve because forward head syndrome becomes a lesser issue, which relieves pressure on the neck and shoulders. Knees becomes better, because not only is there less weight on the legs, but there is less weight on the front of your body pulling you into the from on your foot, which is often a culprit of knee pain, as it makes the knee a weight bearing joint which it’s no designed to be (weight should be equally distributed on then entire foot when in a neutral standing position, not placed in the front). \n\nI could go on about more benefits, but I have felt all the ones I described above.",
