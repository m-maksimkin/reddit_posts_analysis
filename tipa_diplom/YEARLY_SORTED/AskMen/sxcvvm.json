    "Why are young men giving up on dating?\nThe title isn't what I originally posted, but my post kept on being removed. \n\nI thought it would be better to ask on this sub instead of r/datingadvice, because I think the replies from this sub would be much more understanding.\n\nI've just been watching a video on YouTube about how a lot of young men are leaving society, and this is something I've very recently done as well.\n\nI had to really weight up the pros and cons of doing this, but last week I decided to unfollow every girl on my Instagram account. It's not because I'm misogynistic, because I'm not that at all. It's more to do with how the average man is shown how easily disposable he is. How dating apps have completely ruined the dating market. There's a lot more reasons as to why I've just decided to go my own way.\n\nThe constant feeling of wanting affection all stems from social media. I came to the realisation that I'm doing nothing but wasting my time by talking to girls that only want to talk on Instagram, but wouldn't even pick up the phone for a call, let alone meet up. It's a waste of time watching their stories and liking their pictures, because that's time and effort that I could be putting towards my hobbies.\n\nI'm a 23 year old guy, and I don't think this subject is talked about anywhere near as much as it should be. But why is that? This is a problem that will only get worse over time, and the stats for that don't lie either.\n\nHas anyone else decided to do this as well?\n\nEDIT: I probably won't be able to reply to all of the comments, but when I get some spare time, I'll try my best to reply to everyone. If I don't reply to you, I'll read your comment and upvote it. I don't like putting posts up and not replying or, at the very least, acknowledging the comments.\n\nEdit 2: I'm getting comments every second. This is crazyüòÇ I guess it just goes to show that basically most men have given up on dating. There's no way I'll be able to get round to reading all of the comments, but I wish all of you the best‚úåÔ∏è\n\nEdit 3: Question: Can you convert Reddit awards into real money? If so, I'd be richüòÇü§ë": [

Studies have shown that literally 20% of men are having sex with 80% of the women, in the western world (US). The other 80% of men are having no sex or sex once every couple of years. Societal expectations created by women have ruined dating for any man who doesn't have most of the things on the list above. We have to build up so much value just to get a woman to talk to us, all women have to do is exist and they will be sought after.

One of the common complaints is men are single because women will no longer settle for a guy within her league ‚Äúso the average woman rejects the average guy.‚Äù But why would you want someone who sees you as average? Why would you want to settle yourself for someone YOU see as average? Why would you want someone who potentially resents you because they couldn‚Äôt pursue what they really wanted? \n\nThere are less and less societal pressures to get married and have kids. Overall, isn‚Äôt that a good thing? It means the only people marrying and having kids are those that really want to; less divorces, less neglected kids. Marriage and kids are some of the most unpredictable things in life; they‚Äôll potentially break your heart no matter how hard you try. (My partner and I deeply wanted kids and experienced a long stretch of infertility.) Isn‚Äôt it a good thing to acknowledge that kind of risk taking just isn‚Äôt for you? There‚Äôs no shame in recognizing you won‚Äôt put your heart on the line for certain things. After my ectopic I seriously considered if I could take the heartbreak of continuing fertility treatment that might lead nowhere while costing thousands of dollars. Young men recognizing they can have happy and fulfilled lives with risks in some places and not others is a great step in self awareness and boundaries. \n\nMen and women don‚Äôt NEED relationships anymore. Women don‚Äôt need a husband to have a credit card; men don‚Äôt need women as the sole source of emotional fulfillment as mens friendships grow more emotionally intimate. If dating isn‚Äôt worth it‚Ä¶. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that! Embrace a contented single life. \n\nI think it‚Äôs actually wonderful to see men starting to see their emotions as valid, build support networks outside of romantic relationships, and grow themselves through things that bring them joy. Emotionally fulfilled, happy men can only be a benefit for society. It also means the only men dating are those that WANT to, not those that feel they HAVE to. Right now I think a lot of women stay off the dating scene because they feel these crushing expectations that a guy is only with them to check a box and get sex. Guys who don‚Äôt base their self esteem on dating success will inevitably be less cruel when rejected; their standards will be higher so compatibility becomes more important than just getting any date. \n\nSo long as men are going their own way because they want to focus on their own happiness, as opposed to somehow trying to punish women by withdrawing and then resenting that it doesn‚Äôt change the dating market, is not a bad thing in my book.",

Seriously, go on a porn diet for a week and you'll be thinking all day how you can get out and meet people.   \n2. Might be a little off tangent TBH, but the newest generation is definitely much much more concerned with superficial values, most likely due to the internet and social media. Young people are more interested in looking like they live a fun life, but honestly the vast majority of them seem dead inside despite how their social media might present. IMO this desire of superficiality causes people to look for hookups and increase their \"body count\" more instead of dating and pursuing long-term relationships.\n3. The rise of the entertainment addiction for all age groups has definitely hogged the vast majority of our free time. It's extremely easy to sink time into youtube/netflix/games and various social media and other entertainment outlooks instead of actually spending your free-time in meaningful ways. Meaningful ways that would allow us to socialize, meet new people and friends of friends that could be potential partners. Obviously these forms of media are spectacular, but you would be out of your mind to think that the average person balances everything out appropriately. After work and school people are given options of spending time with others, outside, or with friends, but often they choose the comfortable and safe option of staying at home and binging their favorite time waster. Another point on this I have is that this shit DEFINITELY saps our energy out. The body gets used to the extreme amount of sitting + screen time we all have and makes us feel sluggish. Spending a day watching a show or playing games also can feel so much safer and comfortable then lets say, going out to a mentally taxing and potentially uncomfortable social event.\n4. Dating apps are difficult for the average man and could be lowering their self confidence. When in reality the average or below average looking man can have a significantly easier time pursuing relationships IRL.\n\nTLDR: Porn, the entertainment and social media boom can make a young man feel like all their needs are fulfilled. It has let us slowly turn into sluggish homebodies stuck in our comfortable shells. Once a person has been stuck in their comfortable and secure shell of constant games, watching porn, and staying at home, going out and meeting women can seem like mentally taxing chore or even extremely nerve wrecking.    \n\nAlso the dating apps can suck.",

Good news is really guys in late 30s up seem to have the ball in their court. Women own the dating scene in their 20s (and maybe early 30s). But the tables turn after the biological clock starts ticking louder. \n\nIt seems the trend is young women tell themselves \"I've got a lot of time....\" and become promiscuous,  delay commitment,  focus on careers often, then when they're ready to settle they get a rude awakening.  They have lost much of their market value to men. Because men don't tend to care so much about her career, etc. Feminism is backfiring and it's too late when they figure it out. They're taught to be strong, independent, \"I don't need no man.\" \n\nSo, men learn to live without having a committed partner. And then in their late 30s, 40s women get frustrated they can't find what they want. Irony.  And really nobody wins. People often bond better when they commit jn their 20s and stick with each other.",

The adrenaline of doing something scary like that is addictive so each time you do it you wanna try again. Rejection sucks but the adrenaline makes it a subtle net positive and repeatable experience. And practice makes perfect. You get better and better the more you fail. And trust me. Fail you will. Like learning an instrument or to paint etc.  You will suck for a long time. But one day you will figure out your style and things will begin to work out.  Problem now is with dating online. Texting. Apps etc. The adrenaline is much much lower so it doesn't cover the rejection enough. So you have a net negative experience. Enough rejection at net negative you will give up. It's chemistry at it's base. Why do something that that causes you negative vibes. Snowboarding is fun, you will hurt yourself a lot but the falling can be fun too and keeps you going. Getting better each time. My advice. Learn a hobby. Join a group.  Book club, sport, choir, gardening. Get a dog and take them for a walk every day in a dog park. Meet people. Practice being social and learn who you are. Once you know who you are, dating becomes much much easier. Stay in the real world. I don't mean this on a bad way. But make an effort to make yourself interesting. \"Be yourself\" is a nice idea. But if you are not interesting, have no cool stories or life experiences to talk about, no hobbies or passions to talk about. No skill, dream, aspirations to talk about then why would anyone want to hang out with you.  No one owes you love just because you're nice, sweet, kind etc. You might get lucky.

It's not because I'm misogynistic\n\nSee you're missing the misogyny in there in that you apparently weren't following these women because you were interested in what they were sharing or who they were, you were following them because you see women as date fodder, and if they don't make YOU personally feel validated as a man then they are not worth folloiwng. Clearly if you are able to unfollow every girl on there then they weren't that important to you; no friends or family? Do you have any female friends at all that you actually care about as friends? You ironically showed how disposable women are because they show how disposable men are. Then said that's not misogynistic.\n\n>How dating apps have completely ruined the dating market.\n\nHave they? As a very average man I have found it has opened up the market for me, made it easier for me to meet women. Especially as someone who doesn't have the confidence to go up and start conversations with strangers, dating apps make it so much easier. You're seeing it like there's a hell of a lot of competition because most men are getting rejected, rather than seeing that actually the bar is INSANELY low. Most men on dating apps are boring, sexist, and barely get past the first 2 messages (usually \"hey how r u?\" and \"hey sexy\"). You literally have to do better than the absolute bare minimum that 90% of men on those apps are doing and you'll get a date.\n\n>The constant feeling of wanting affection all stems from social media.\n\nNo, the constant feeling of wanting affection stems from being a social animal, which we all are. It is totally normal to want to be part of a (real life) social network, and also to desire physical (sexual) affection. As a straight man, it is totally normal to want to have sex with women and to wish to be desired by them. It existed long before social media, otherwise we'd have all died out millennia ago.\n\n>I came to the realisation that I'm doing nothing but wasting my time by talking to girls that only want to talk on Instagram, but wouldn't even pick up the phone for a call, let alone meet up.\n\nNo, you're wasting your time being a guy who will only talk to girls on instagram and thinks that's enough to get a date. You're wasting your time by expecting a date through instagram in the first place, and you're wasting your time by seeing women on instagram as purely date material. No wonder they don't want to pick up the phone or meet up. Why would they? Who even are you to them other than yet another weird guy sliding into their DMs trying to hook up? Why would anyone ever think such a thing would work?\n\n>because that's time and effort that I could be putting towards my hobbies.\n\nFinally, something you got right. Absolutely, go spend time on your hobbies. Go make yourself a fully rounded person with an actual life who isn't obsessing over trying to get laid via Instagram. Use your hobbies to create a social life, meet humans, enjoy their company, do things together without trying to fuck them, and eventually you might be someone women might actually want to date.\n\n>I don't think this subject is talked about anywhere near as much as it should be\n\nHA! There's literally a post like this every damn day and there's thousands of subreddits dedicated to this sort of thing. It's genuinely tiring trying to respond to it.\n\nTL;DR: You're blaming women and social media for your shortcomings and you've decided to \"go your own way\" and disconnect from society, when in fact you should be switching off instagram and going out and actually engaging with society like the social animal you are. Your problems are not from being part of society but from already not being part of it and thinking that chatting to women on Instagram was the way to get laid. If you decide to \"go your own way\" you're just going to end up more lonely, more bitter and resentful of everyone else who's out here having a good time. You don't need to disconnect, you need to come out of your bedroom and find a real social life, to take your focus away from filling that void in your life with a woman and instead focus on finding actual joy in your life.",

I'm assuming being in a stable relationship is the desirable outcome for everyone (this needs to be validated though)\n\nThe truth is the dating app model has really gone and screwed things up. Women get to be pickier, and the availability of male suitors really puts things in their power. Meanwhile most men suffer from poor matches. Even if they get matches, the women don't put any effort into the interaction and if they get the number there's still no guarantee they'll show up to the date and even if they do there's still no guarantee of chemistry. I get it. \n\nThe dating app model puts too much information in front you, when real relationships are a process of discovery. I read more and more anecdotes about how some men have unforgivable qualities that would have turned their partners off, but they were together for a year at that point and \"that bad smoking habit\" seemed to be a minor thing at that point in the relationship.\n\nSo the trick here is not to play the dating app game. Go out and talk to people in real life. Make people laugh, make them smile and that alone will make you feel better than lying on your bed, browsing Instagram, liking pictures of scantily clad women before reaching into your pants to jack off. \n\nAnd I'm not saying that talking to people in the real world is easy.

I put in good grooming and house plants, and they give me relationship. Holy shit, you're interacting with a person! Of course it's different standards every time, it's a different PERSON. Stop acting like dating is a slot machine and stamping your feet because the house rigged it in favor of the high rollers. All this \"more desirable men\" and \"modern harem\" BS is just self-harm, it's nonsense to make you feel like the victim of some vast conspiracy. Are there men and women that go for cheap casual encounters and treat each other like toys and are generally shitty? Yeah. Who the fuck cares, though? They are an absurdly small minority, you're hurt feelings are just outsizing their impact.\n\nTwo, so many people are commenting about 'disconnecting from society' or joining weird cult-like self-improvement regimens.... shit just don't date for a while and treat yourself (and others) like a person, you don't need to be melodramatic about doing what the majority of society does. \"Dating\" the way it's described by many of these comments is so a miniscule aspect of society, and is a damned cesspit largely people keep harping on \"winning\" or \"getting something for their investment.\" Focusing on your hobbies and yourself is NORMAL BEHAVOIR THAT NORMAL PEOPLE DO. (Getting stuck in a self destructive dating cycle is also normal behavior, so many don't get too caught up in what's normal).\n\nWhen I read some of these comments, they sound like people who have just discovered that drinking water occasionally makes you feel good or that getting to your forties without exercising isn't a recipe for a good time. It's not a secret club, it's common sense, and it's what huge swathes of people do without giving it special names or being all bent out of shape about it.\n\nTreat yourself like a person, an individual, that deserves love. Treat others like people who deserve love, too. People who are, shockingly, also individuals with tastes and preferences that you don't need to cater or conform to. Are you going to be automatically happy and in a relationship by being yourself? Fuck no. Are you going to be 'happy on your own'? Who the hell knows. Happiness isn't guaranteed, but if you get slamming yourself against tired old tropes about the big bad dating scene, and ignoring what really matters (yourself and other people, as humans, as individuals) than you might be guaranteeing your misery.\n\n(This post was for me, I'm assuming no one is going to read it so I decided to not pull punches.\n\ntl:dr; Sometimes posts like this make me think I'm asexual, because much as I enjoy sex, I can't imagine being this fucking bent out of shape over it. And based on the way many of you talk about women, I worry some of you don't have a concept of a relationship beyond that.)",

Don‚Äôt remember what thread it was that I saw this, but the quote went something along the lines of women are looking for fresh water in a swamp while men are looking for something to drink in a dessert. \n\nOther issues come down to standards that many women have. The 6‚Äô0‚Äù or fuck off mentality is a very real thing. I‚Äôm lucky enough to be with a woman who doesn‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô8‚Äù (helps that she‚Äôs 5‚Äô4‚Äù) and years of steroid use have left me with a decent enough looking body that that part at least stands out from the crowd, even when I‚Äôm wearing clothes. Other issues include the financial demand that are placed on men. We‚Äôre often expected to be providers and pay for a ton. In my previous 2 year long relationship I could count on one hand the number of times the bill was split so I only paid for my meal and my now ex would pay for hers. Not once was I ever ‚Äòtaken out‚Äô and all of the dates were either completely financed by me or split down the middle. Not everyone can afford that sort of thing. I was fortunate enough that I was working in a mine at that point, but the money I was making was being put aside for the express purpose of paying for university, not financing a one sided relationship.\n\nThis also may not be an issue for everyone, but the prevalence of OnlyFans and premium Snapchat accounts is also worth noting. I‚Äôm not going to argue the validity of sex work since it‚Äôs not a topic I particularly care about and not one that‚Äôs particularly relevant. The relevant part is it‚Äôs widespread. Spend some time on Tinder or some other dating app and see how many OnlyFans pages are linked or how many times you‚Äôre offered a premium Snapchat account. If you‚Äôre looking for something exclusive, then having hundreds or thousands of people watching your girlfriend masturbate on camera may pose a problem. It‚Äôs something that I personally wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with and it took a decent chunk of time filtering out those types of accounts.\n\nThe last major issue is looking at long term prospects. Even if things go great with this woman and you end up marrying her, your odds of success still boil down to a coin flip given how high the divorce rate is. A 50% chance of losing about half of your everything with the possibility of alimony payments as well depending on who the breadwinner was. And god forbid there‚Äôs children involved seeing as the family court is heavily biased towards children. Hopefully you like seeing your kids on weekends only, even if you reach a joint custody settlement.\n\nThe point is that there‚Äôs a myriad of hurdles to get over when it comes to dating, and even if you do the long term prospects aren‚Äôt statistically great looking.

Meeting people in real life is much better, but so much harder now. \n When people see a picture of you they have very little to go on. They literally have to judge you by your looks. In person many people are more attractive because you can see them smile and interact with them. You can see their personality, their sense of humor, their kindness, etc.\n\nThe advice I give to my guy friends is to pursue hobbies where they could meet women in person. You could also take classes at a community center, or see if your local community college offers non-credit classes. Think cooking classes, dance classes, anything really.\nWhen I was single I once took a swing dance class for fun, most people came solo and the class ratio was 3 girls to every guy! The guys were in great demand. This would be a great place to meet women. Don't worry about being a bad dancer or uncoordinated, the ladies will just be happy to have a dance partner.\nAnything that sounds fun and will get you out meeting people is good. Even if you just make friends with the women you meet. They could always introduce you to their friends, and you might meet someone that way.\nGood luck guys.",

But I just can‚Äôt bring myself to take someone who posts half naked pictures on social media on a weekly basis seriously, and that is a huge percentage of women under the age of 30. They are generally prone to extreme attention seeking behavior and it‚Äôs evident when you look at their social media - not even just Instagram, they‚Äôll post on everything, Twitter, Snapchat stories, etc. It is FUCKING CONSTANT and tiring to even see. \n\nI‚Äôd say like 60% of the girls i hung out literally started telling me their life sob stories and this whole ‚Äò‚Äômy life is so hard I am so sad‚Äô on the first date, which is fine I guess, but it‚Äôs kind of weird‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to sound like an asshole but it‚Äôs physically impossible for me to NOT view it as attention seeking behavior when it‚Äôs happened so many times right on the first date. And I know for a fact those girls probably go on lots of dates. Do that do that every single time they go on a date with a guy? Probably. Why would they do that if it wasn‚Äôt for attention? And I get it, people genuinely do have difficult lives and I should be sympathetic, but scenarios like this are a wonderful indicator that this romantic partner is going to ignore or refuse to acknowledge your own feelings and just try to get you to feel bad for her and exclusively pay attention to her issues throughout the entire course of the relationship.\n\nFor that reason, I‚Äôm out.",

ITT I learn that any thoughts I have had that having found my life partner irl may have potentially been a lesser strategy than what is available now are misguided. I thought online dating was to make it easier to find someone who is compatible with you to be each other's regular source of affection and companionship, and it could be deepening relationships since you are able theoretically to find a \"closer match\" right off the bat... seems thoigh everything has gone to hell and online interactions have become more about a short term score. More like mutual prostitution maybe than mutual commitment. Also starting to make more sense that arranged marriages in some cultures are seemingly just as successful at making people happy. Starting with some framework of commitment seems to be key.\n\nAlso seems like women might be using online interactions as a free escort service and saving any actual commitment for guys they have irl social context with? Like, my younger brother had a very successful online match with his now wife but it was really that all their friends either already knew each other or were super compatible as well that cinched the deal - they had whole lives that fit together as a social fabric not just some witty dm's to hold them together.

This is like wondering into the desert looking for water.\n\nThe next big mistake you seem to be on the verge of making is writing off all women based on this unpleasant experience.As a random internet bro I will give you some very simple, practical advice to follow:\n\n1. Forget about \"needing\" a girl - just be happy within yourself. This is rule number one, and if you can truly digest that, whatever happens after is irrelevant.\n2. Start working out. This will do wonders for your self confidence and mental health. Set a target body weight and try to reach it. Set PB's, and try to beat them.\n3. Ditch social media altogether. Facebook, Insta, Tinder, Twitter, etc. These are all literal trash cans and choosing not to participate will improve your life. Empower your self to be different and live in the real world.\n4. Go out and pursue some hobbies in a social setting. Try Yoga classes, painting classes, cooking classes, dancing classes - whatever interests you.\n5. Try to make some female friends. No sex, no funny business - just find some girls that are cool and become friends with them.\n\nAbove all, do not do any of the above with any sort of ulterior motive to \"get girls\". These are steps for you to take to improve your life. Simple as that. If women begin to notice you, so be it, and maybe you will find love after all, but your number 1 priority needs to be yourself. Improve yourself, improve your relationships and attitudes towards your self and others, ditch the depressing cesspit that is social media and go enjoy your life! You're worth it champ, but nobody is going to hand it to you on a platter and it sure as shit isn't going to happen through a screen.",

Therefore as someone who has lived both sides of the Great Date-able Divide, I think I have some good insights here.\n\nI was a bullied scrawny Asian kid growing up in a very much racist southern US in the 90s. Things were not good. I was that one loser kid all the girls pretended to \"like\", so that I'd put in a bunch of emotional investment, and then the girls would do the very public, \"eww I can't believe you thought I'd like you, you fucking loser\" thing. \n\nAfter law school, and after my first marriage (it was a green card marriage guys, I was doing the Aziz Ansari in parks and rec thing where I was married to a really hot woman but we were really just friends and I was helping with her immigration thing), a lot of things changed. I became a lot more confident because of work - working a lot of billion dollar deals and hanging out with other lawyers just made this process natural, you either find a way to communicate confidence to your clients or you are treated like a shitty lawyer. The rise of Kpop normalized the \"pretty asian boy\" look. I became a lot less bitter about things because, well, the world treated me a lot better now.\n\nAnd this became a virtuous cycle very quickly, I'd find girls who were interested because of very shallow things (money and yellow fever seems to be the prevailing ones now), but their attention gave me the confidence (and the regular supply of sex) to have the balls to dare look for a woman who matches well with me, rather than one that just wants to use me. \n\nAnd guys, I'm not lying or tricking any of these women. I'm very upfront about the fact that I'm with a number of women, I have a wife with whom I share love and affection, and girlfriends with whom I share sex and good company. \n\nI have more girls interested in being just one of a number of side chicks, than there are girls who are interested in dating my best friend, who is essentially the same person as me, but white and a bit more socially awkward. That communicates to me that most women out there say they are looking for a serious relationship, but have no idea what that even looks like. They have spent their whole lives having everyone of their desires being entertained by men who thought doing so would allow for sex, that they now would rather prefer to be one of a number of fuck-buddies with a guy who is good at providing this temporary entertainment, rather than build something lasting with someone who is less good at that entertainment.\n\nNot sure what the solution is, but the problems are as I've laid out.",

Why the hell should I date?\n\nI‚Äôm a reasonably attractive late 30s guy with a nice house, stable life, solid finances, etc. To get a date there are three, maybe four options:\n\n1.) Online dating. This is misery. For every 100 swipes I get maybe 5-10 matches. For every 10 well considered, concise messages I get maybe 1-2 replies. For every 4-5 replies I get one conversation. For every 5 conversations I get maybe one or two that aren‚Äôt just me carrying. Those usually lead to dates, which typically go well. It‚Äôs a pain in the ass and usually only ends in a hook up or brief relationship / fling that goes nowhere and wastes time.\n\n2.) Cold approaches. I hate doing these. If I hit on a woman in some random public place I usually get rejected, and often get weird looks. I haven‚Äôt done this in years.\n\n3.) Bars and clubs. This is awful because it attracts the worst type of people; alcoholics. I can‚Äôt hear shit over the music anyways and it‚Äôs impossible to have a conversation.\n\n4.) Friends and family connections. Once in a while I get introduced to someone through friends and family. This is so rare it isn‚Äôt really a good option, but it seems to have potential.\n\nAny other ideas where to meet women? Because this shit never works. Also, men, STAY OFF OF BUMBLE it is literally the worst dating app. You will never get messages no matter how many women match with you.\n\nFinally, there‚Äôs the ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù topic:\n\nI just don‚Äôt really care for most of the women I can date. Most are single mothers, most are fat, and the rest seem to have some drug addiction,  major psychological issue, etc. I spend hours every day ensuring I am in shape, hygienic, groomed, etc. I have no serious issues, I‚Äôve never been married, and I have no kids, and I don‚Äôt need a goddamn therapist to deal with a few mean words at work. Furthermore I make enough money that if I mentioned it here nobody would believe me.\n\nI am not going to settle for a woman who doesn‚Äôt take care of her body, doesn‚Äôt care about her health, or has a bunch of kids by another man (or multiple other men). Most especially I‚Äôm not going to settle for a weak woman with the mindset of an entitled brat. I‚Äôve worked hard to earn my place in this world and I don‚Äôt want to squander it on some narcissistic, superficial womanchild whose idea of a hard day involves bad tips and a few lost Instagram followers‚Ä¶ and whose idea of sex appeal is a layer of makeup thicker than the paint on my ‚Äò67 mustang.\n\nIn short, I‚Äôm open to dating but I want women to start shouldering some of the burden. I want women who hold themselves to the same high standards I hold myself to. Being athletic and eating proper food is not an option, it‚Äôs the bare minimum; if you‚Äôre 35 and still gorging yourself on pizza and avoiding the gym you aren‚Äôt a woman, you‚Äôre a girl. You‚Äôre no better than the men who sit around playing video games all day and praying their parents wire more money for rent. Time to grow up. \n\nI‚Äôm more than happy to go the rest of my life hooking up. I want to start a family, but that seems like a pipe dream on the current dating landscape.",

No amount of hard reality will make them consider men around their own strata when they think they can snag Chad Moneybags with their physical assets. Problem is, every other woman their level and above will be doing the exact same thing, with large numbers of over-entitled women chasing very small numbers of ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù men.\n\nAnd those top-shelf men that _so many women_ pursue with such vigour have their pick of women - why should they settle with anything less than a 9 or a 10, and only once they‚Äôre good and ready to do so? For them, anything less than that is typically just a chew toy, fit only to keep a bed warm. Which is what they do, frequently, _because they can._ They never have any intention of marrying these women, they just take what is being freely offered.\n\nThe problem we have here is one of reach. Before the Internet, any one woman was limited to her social group, maybe a hundred or so single guys that she could come in physical contact with on anything approximating a regular basis. This limited how much attention she got, and kept her own ego from being overblown.\n\nNow, with the Internet, any woman can create an online profile and - with the right marketing and effort - have _thousands_ if not _tens of thousands_ of thirsty s!mps clamouring for her attention. With this level of attention, is it any surprise that these women are acquiring egos that are - in terms of their non-physical attributes - massively out of proportion to what they bring to the table?\n\n(Aside: I should point out that massive egos are not gender-specific. ‚ÄúDesirable‚Äù top-shelf men can and often do acquire equally outsized egos. However, only a tiny fraction of men will ever have the ability to ‚Äòpull‚Äô the attentions of many women, whereas the vast majority of women have an almost trivial ability to ‚Äòpull‚Äô the attentions of many men with comparatively minimal effort)\n\nHonestly, IMO the only woman worth chasing in today‚Äôs world is a woman who has no significant online presence. And good luck with that.\n\nThat‚Äôs not to say that these women don‚Äôt exist. They do. But you have a greater chance of winning the Powerball ten times in a row.\n\nAnd why bother expending so much effort for such a vanishingly tiny chance of any payback? It‚Äôs illogical, irrational, and a waste of your time and your mental health.\n\nTL;DR: just ignore them. Just disengage. Don‚Äôt be a s!mp. Don‚Äôt be an !ncel. Just live your life as your own.

            "text": "The dating market has evolved in such a way with online dating, that men and women have access to a lot more people than they did before. With this being said, the comparisons are easier to make when swiping one way or another on dating apps. Plenty of fish released some data while back that women tend to only swipe positively on the top 5-10% of men. Men's scores were closer to the top 40%. \n\nAs we all know generally women have many more suitors than men, except in this new situation this top percentage men have a lot more options available to them. Before options were so abundant, people settled down earlier. The small percentage of men might find a committed relationship they are happy with because they don't have the grass is Greener effect with all of the options they are being given. This keeps them apparently still available and out in the dating market messing things up for the other 90-95% of men.\n\nOn top of this whereas you used to only have access to your immediate pool of friends and coworkers, you now have access to everyone within a 100 mile radius. Younger men typically have less to offer in a relationship than an older man might. Teenagers just getting out of high school, college students, they all might be broke. Tradesmen in their early twenties, even into their mid thirties will have more money available to them and be able to offer more redeeming experiences to potential partners. \n\nAnd the data released by tinder 2 years ago, younger women typically go for men a few years older than them, if I can remember correctly somewhere between 3 and 10 years depending on their own age. With this being another factor, younger women are going after older men, and a smaller percentage of the older men that they might actually find attractive, witty, and worth their time.\n\nAll of these factors combined create an unfortunate circumstance for younger men. Most younger men just are not grabbing the attention of women in their age group. Women in their mid-20s to 30s are not going to date these younger men typically. It comes down to a very small percentage of women who are actually interested in these men and that leaves many alone and frustrated.\n\nPersonally if I was getting into my closing years of college and couldn't find any women interested in me, I might give up as well. By that point you found other ways to invest your time. Your hormones aren't as strong as they were when you were younger and it becomes something as important to you as it is foreign.",

We then started dating and couldn't be happier. After an amazing year, I genuinely thought I had found the one, we then went to a party and had been drinking a little, it was a fairly big one so we kind of lost each other halfway through, but I am not the clingy and jealous type and she really wasn't the kind of girl you thought would ever cheat. I then text her I'm just catching up with some buddies and asked her ''you have a ride home right?'', she then replied and confirmed she did, we texted a little more, but I didn't see her for the rest of the night. The following week, my gf acted a little distant, but I dint think much of it. A week after the party, my friend tells me that him and my girlfriend had hooked up and that he thinks it's fucked up that she didn't tell me. Without even saying sorry, he just leaves.

Most of the commenters have stated they have male friends that all feel the same way etc.\n\nHow easy is it for you to make friends with a new guy? Are you actually interesting enough to strike up a conversation with a dude? Do you have enough to talk about? Can you describe your hobbies.\n\nWomen are not gatekeepers like they're made out to be. I think the average women is just tired of the same rhetoric, and the same baseless conversation.\n\nI met my now wife, on Instagram. A few days into chatting she asked \"why haven't you asked about my sex life yet? Most guys would have by now\". I was puzzled as to a) why I would ask that; and b) what good that information would do me.\n\nI don't think enough men differentiate themselves. I see it over and over again with my female friends - they get the same lines, the same baseless conversation.\n\nWhat ignites your passion? No matter how nerdy or alt it is? What makes you want to live.\n\nWomen (and men) are more interested in people with a passion for life and what they are doing on this planet. Not people that barely speak because \"what's the point?\"  \n\n\nEdit: After more reading - a lot of you need to work on your self-esteem and inner dialogue. I am a pretty average looking dude. I have zero athletic ability. Fairly intelligent. Somewhat geeky/nerdy interests.  \n\n\nYet, in my head, I am a 10/10. You don't want me? Your loss - not mine. I know what I am, I know what I have to offer, and I won't compromise on that just to \"have a girlfriend\".  \n\n\nI'll also leave you with a quote from Rise Against which I found strangely prophetic before meeting my wife - \"you can't truly love until you've given up on it\".  \n\n\nChin up to all you dudes. You all likely have something to offer - you just need to realise it and embrace it. Speak to a woman IRL - what makes a man who is a \"4\" seem like a \"10\"? Self-confidence. If you know who you are, you won't care about what others think of you - and that is one of the most attractive traits in any gender.",

I think a lot of young men believe themselves to either be too special or not special enough: they either think they‚Äôre entitled to a woman saying yes, or they believe no woman will ever say yes, either out of fear or experience. From my own experience, I can tell you that being both entitled and self-conscious leads to bad places in life. I also believe that the proliferation of the Internet and its crawling social tendrils have had adverse effects on the generation(s) raised on it: from porn to social media and a whole lot else, a lot of wind has been prematurely sucked from the sails of a lot of young men. What‚Äôs the solution? Well, aside from going full log cabin, you could and should continuous improve yourself. Work on yourself, learn a skill, find Jesus or something - whatever will improve your body, mind, and soul and, most importantly, give you something other people want.

Everyone is a unique snowflake...just like everybody else. You're unique and special, but so is everyone else.

Following people on Instagram and liking their posts and playing that game of showering them with attention on social media because you transparently want to get with them...like all the other dudes doing exactly the same thing? Bleh. Think about it, if you do that, you're just another face in the crowd. If you were her, why would you pick you? Why you over all the other dudes? They have lives and stories, they think they are worthy, \"but she just doesn't give them a chance to see!\"\n\nI don't love the way it has manifested in some of the practices you allude to, but women nowadays have more self worth and are more assertive and active in their search for partners. That is a good thing and they deserve to have that freedom and they shouldn't have to settle for bare minimums (or less) if they don't want to.\n\nFocusing on yourself and being happy and confident in that, living genuinely, is, itself, easier and more fulfilling, but also often more attractive than being a simpering loser sniffing after scraps anywhere he can get them.

Time and time again people who theorize and subscribe to the 80-20 rule, or find any excuse for them not being able to date, is just wrong.\n\nMy handsome, charming, but short friend. Pulls 10/10 girls in an instant. The guy plays Yu Gi Oh for gods sake, but because he's also an individual with actual personality, he does well in the dating market.\n\nMy other friend is fat and ugly, yet he's adventurous and a huge foodie. Gets girls too, but he also cheated on them and his current girlfriend still stays with him.\n\nMy theory is social media and gaming really eroded young men's social skills, and outside of gaming they do not have a personality. My friends who are all huge gamers struggle with finding a girlfriend; even the handsome ones, while other friends who just having a normal life gets girls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Social media & gaming causes guys to become socially awkward and give up too easily at rejection, thus not being able to get girls and instead make all these theories and excuses on why they can't get one. They also never ask the girl out, and beat around the bush instead afraid of rejection.",

I know this because I did terrible on dating apps for years until I put a lot of work getting into shape, wardrobe, started making a lot more money, etc.. Then I‚Äôd match with almost every girl. I was dating 5 girls at once for a whole year one time. I threw away my morals and just had fun for a bit. I had lost weight from 240 down to 160 (6‚Äô ft tall). After 190lbs, every 10lbs I‚Äôd go down, even more attractive women would seem to become available. It‚Äôs an extremely shallow world of attraction these days. \n\n2) Women know immediately if they will ever be interested in you\n\nOnce I realized you cannot ever convince a woman who hasn‚Äôt already decided you‚Äôre datable that she should date you, life became easier. I realized chasing is for suckers. Women decide who they want to date. I grew tired of all the work of dating apps and would just go out to bars and throw a positive vibe, all the while keeping my eyes up and looking around. When a woman is interested in you, she WILL let you know. Most commonly long eye contact and a smile. It happened maybe once a month. But when I got the invitation to approach, more often than not it would lead somewhere, even if it was just a date. Chasing is for suckers. Let the women who want you pick you and be ready to spot the signals. \n\nHonestly, even with all my success, I found dating to be tiring, expensive, emotionally unfulfilling, and generally frustrating. I gained the weight back and no one wanted anything to do with me. Then I met my wife on a random dating app‚Ä¶.and we just clicked. From the first date on, it was something different.

I thought that if i did that people would hit me up irl more, but it turns out it has the opposite effect and you end up more easily forgotten now that you aren't in people's libe feed anymore.\n\nAs to giving up dating....no but kinda yes. As a guy I'm pretty fed up with all the **work** i have to do to win a just to be worth a girls time. While women wanted Gender equality, the sure as hell dont care to even the playing field im the dating game. The area im specifically talking about is the beginning. On average a girl expects me to lead the conversations and make things interesting while they reply with ‚Äùcool\" or some lame conversation killer. Bars are crappy, some expect drinks or you approach them and you got like a minute to impress them and show your worth their time. Basically the way that women act its almost as if they could care less about us guys while we're the only interested party. Oh and on top of that sometimes i can't even talk to women without them automatically assuming they need to be careful because all i probably want is sex, which btw if we do have sex, god forbid anything happens to the relationship because then that automatically becomes a bad thing because i must have only wanted her for sex, which btw sex is supposed to be a mutually enjoyable act but they act like we mugged them and stole their money. Speaking of money, girls always complain about being \"used\" for sex in which they literally lose nothing yet girl will lead men along and have no issue with using our money. I remember how stupid i felt after the relationship with a girl who i was willing to \"wait for the right time\" for, both of us wasted each others time but damn i probably wasted like 1k throughout all those dates, so fuck that shit lol.\n\nSo i pretty much decided that im not going to try to get any woman any more, so i won't be dating unless a woman goes through the trouble of trying to get with me.  Cause first i have to make sure im equally desired, then afterwards i expect 50/50 im not going any further for her than she will for me. Realistically most women probably wouldn't bother giving up their position of being the one who's being chased to take on the traditionally mens role which is far more trouble, so in a way im pretty much out the dating scene.\n\nAnyway thats my honest opinion on the matter",

For example, a man who's 5'6\" would have to earn $175,000 more to be seen as desirable as a 6 ft tall man. \n\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/robkhenderson/status/1346486298735947776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1346486298735947776%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrobible.com%2Fculture%2Farticle%2Fshort-men-must-earn-more-money%2F\n\nI could go into more stats, but what we see is that you have to be an exceptional man in order to be desired by even average women. Most of us are not exceptional. Also, men are asked to take on an extraordinary amount of responsibility with very little authority in return. I haven't checked out of the dating scene, but it's definitely tough when you look at the stats. And that's not including divorce rates and child custody statistics. It can be disheartening.",

If you‚Äôre in your twenties then going down that path will only hurt. \n\nI‚Äôm a fat ugly dude. I found a great wife, who I love dearly and loves me back. So if you look like me and don‚Äôt make lots of money here is what worked for me\n\n1:  adjust expectations. The books with the best cover don‚Äôt necessarily have a great story. And covers fade over time, but the content inside is what‚Äôs there for ever.  And make sure none of the expectations you hold come from porn. That will not help you in any way. No problem having a fantasy.  No problem liking a great set of boobs. But do not descend into some mental fantasy life. The only victim there is you. \n\n2:  your dating profile is not there to act like fly paper. The dating apps are rigged against you, but it‚Äôs still a numbers game. Your profile should weed out the ones that will never appreciate you before you ever match with them. Stop trying to make it appeal to everyone. One real match will get your further than 100 based on false pretenses. And avoiding those doomed matches will let you avoid a lot of unneeded stress. If you‚Äôre a warhammer nerd, get a picture of you painting a mini on your profile. If you‚Äôre a comic con nerd, get a picture of you at comic con on there.  If you like backpacking make sure there‚Äôs a picture on there of you after 3 days on the trail. Looking happy and exhausted but fully involved in your hobby. The profile should reflect you. Not the you that you want to exist. The you that actually exists. The real you is what you want them to match with. That way you won‚Äôt have to pretend when it comes time to talk or date them. \n\n3:  be honest about what you want. If what you want is to fuck, put it on your profile. If what you want is someone to curl up on the couch with and watch Netflix, then be honest about it. \n\nYour profile needs to go to 1 or 2 good people out of the 10s of thousands that will see it. Don‚Äôt attract the ones that you know won‚Äôt work. \n\nAnd read some stoic philosophy. There‚Äôs a great book called how to be stoic by massimo pigliucci. It‚Äôs not just keeping a stiff upper lip or being an island unto one‚Äôs self. It‚Äôs a much better principle to guide your life than defaulting to nihilism. \n\nAnd finally, it‚Äôs better to have loved and lost than have never loved at all. It is true. Failed relationships teach you things about yourself.  I should send my ex girlfriends a fruit basket because the failures of mine that they rightly punished me for have made me a good husband. \n\nThere‚Äôs no reason you can‚Äôt find what you‚Äôre looking for. Be intentional. Be honest. Acknowledge failure but don‚Äôt let it make you a failure. Being shot down is ok if you remember that the reason for rejection isn‚Äôt that you‚Äôre not adequate. It‚Äôs that the two of you didn‚Äôt fit. \n\nAnd don‚Äôt descend into nihilism. I‚Äôve been there. There‚Äôs no salvation down there. Just empty bottles, smoked bowls, porn and a deafening silence. Best to leave that path untraveled.",

Do you wanna waste time viewing and liking pics of women that doesn't give a fuck about you or you want to spent your time productively so one day you can own a car, place, business or  reach a goal that will give you blissful satisfaction?  When you reach your goals and have made your money and properties, women will notice you BUT if you have grown in the process, you should know that not any woman should benefit from your success so easily, you must have standars (and if you don't have that, you're not mainly). A high quality man should accept only a high quality woman (and this kind of woman doesn't rely on social media for validation).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a rule, I don't give likes on social media (and my profile pic is private so no one can like it), I only give compliments to people I have a good relationship already since I'm not on this planet to raise random people's ego. Don't give compliments or \"I love you\" easily, not all people deserve it and they should be used only in special occassions.\n\nAs for the mysoginistic label, I have bad news, these days is common to use heavy words easily and most of the time they're used incorrectely. Are you a mysoginistic for unfollowing girls? No. Are you a mysoginistc because you don't give likes to girls pictures? No. Are you mysoginist because you put yourself first than others (women, specially)? Hell no. A mysoginist views women as lower than men, disrespects them without reason, sees them as just objects for lust, sex and procreating (strange, most women put sexualized pics of themselves). Is easy to label a man as a mysoginist simply because he is not giving free benefits to them, but misandry is something that is practiced everyday without punishment (double standards).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDating? Is not something that men should give up, is something that shoudn't exist at this point. Dating puts a lot of pressure for both (since they want to do their best impression) and, to be honest, is a more beneficial for women . You can hava plans solo and if there's room for someone, you can invite someone to join (\"Hey, I'm going to check this place, wanna join), if she accepts, good; is she doesn't, good, you can go by yourself. My point here is don't make plans where you depend on somebody else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhenever they ask why I'm still single, I always say \"my life doesn't revolve around a vagina, I have goals and projects, I don't like wasting my time\".

Just over a decade ago if you had a decent wage and could afford to support a family you were on pretty firm footing in the dating world.

Women are earning more, and tend to be attracted to men of a higher economic status than they are (obligatory, not all women) and I'm hardly a competitive salaryman. Furthermore social media has created beauty standards that are fairly skewed toward stalwart genetic thresholds, height, hair density, beard coverage, jawline, etc. Things you can't really adjust with clothes makeup or exercise. I'm unfortunately a balding pale blonde fella with sparse stubble. I work out and try to dress well, but I learned pretty quickly that doesn't help cover up flaws above the neck. I know that it'd really help my chances to improve my personality but again, mental health issues just make it such a challenge, and when you're ugly and not very well off having a bold, fun and interesting personality is really your last hope and I'm never gonna have the acting skills to be *that guy*.\n\n If I'm being honest, I just haven't been blessed in any respect.

The cost of living and everything that entails is skyrocketing work is ever more demanding with diminishing returns and the mental and emotional health of everyone is suffering taking with it the ability to form connections and to many women included I'd suspect there seems little point especially to the younger generations.\nAdding to that the social landscape has shifted significantly in how we interact with each other in the form of social media which has brought many positives in awareness for human rights but also bombards us with information in a way we're simply not adapted to handle which leads to further stresses and drains on emotional capabilities and can lead to unreasonable expectations for how we should look in terms of self esteem and I suspect unreasonable expectations in many for a potential partner. Also it provides a constant potential source for gratification potentially discouraging more long term efforts to seek out long term connections when the happy chemical is easily available elsewhere. To further add to this many institutions that represented community centers are moving away from the mainstream malls, churches, libraries and now with COVID things like coffee shops and bars are much more insular many people are getting their social fixes online now. \nOne would think online dating would improve circumstances but with previous issues I mentioned added to the fact most dating sites are looking to make money matches are hardly a priority they want *returning* customers so their goal does not in fact line young people up for success.

I concluded that if picking the wrong one was happening more often than not, then it would be a good idea to just not do it at all.\n\nOne of my friends was with a chick for around 10 years and for most of those 10 years he was not consistently happy or content with the relationship. She was physically, mentally and emotionally abusive to him. He wanted out, but for whatever reason stuck with her until the relationship became so devoid of intimacy and love in general that he ended up cheating.\n\nAll the relationships I had were with people who had some sort of glaring issue that I chose to ignore. Alcoholism, parental issues, issues with staying monogamous, etc. My last gf \\[close to 15 years ago now\\] was mentally stuck in high school. She was overly concerned with how people viewed her... like she wanted to be seen/thought of as cool to her friends as well as complete strangers. Was firmly middle class at the lowest and saw herself as some ghetto queen because she listened to rap and knew a couple of amateur rappers. Talked non stop about her ex to me and got mad at me when I made it clear I was not comfortable with her doing that.\n\nAside from personal experiences of myself and friends, after many years of being single I started seeing women as people rather than potential romantic partners. This pretty much tore the ol rose coloured glasses off my face and it allowed me to see women as they truly are: humans. Humans capable of being bastards, liars, cheaters, uncaring, two faced, and every other negative aspect of humans that seem to be ignored when it comes to women and their actions. That really helped me keep a head about me and not allow my dick to do the thinking for me.\n\nShortly after that, the little nagging feeling that comes from attraction just stopped showing up because I'd ignore it anyway. Nowadays I couldn't be arsed to interact with a woman outside of like a customer service scenario, or inconsequential small talk with the female friends of family members.\n\nPut simply, I have the same regard for random women as I do men: they don't mean much, if anything, to me.",

As others have said, I feel like social media has a huge influence on perception and seriously degrades people's interpersonal skills.  Things that used to seem simple, such as striking up a conversation with strangers or having decent non-verbal skills, doesn't seem so simple any more.  On top of that, you have a rising tide of mental health issues that in years past have largely been ignored by society in general.  Now, it feels suffocating.

Now that I'm in my late 30s and have just focused on being me, no matter what anyone else thinks, I seem to have more luck. \n\nI think a lot of guys are too much in their own heads with the pressure of getting some tail like porn and social media tell us we should. The hookup lifestyle doesn't exist anymore but pop culture hasn't  caught up to that fact yet so the last few generations have been reaching for something that doesn't exist, except for the \"model good looks\" lucky few. \n\nBest I can recommend is to focus on you and just be the best that you can be for yourself. Eventually someone is going to recognise that and want to be a part of it. Removing yourself from society is the absolute worst thing you can do because you aren't nurturing those necessary social skills that you build in early adulthood. Hang out with friends, do things, and don't sweat if you're not picking up chick's all the time... eventually you'll cross paths with someone who enjoys you for you. Then you just need to be open to that opportunity.",

They find a girl on some dating app that'll chat them up and seem nice but that girl will never even consider meeting him or giving him the chance cuz she was never there to do that in the first place. That fine for socal media I guess but in a dating that that seems like they're taking advange of men's desperation for attention, love, and hopes for a real relationship. I don't know how often that really happens or if it's a real issue, I just heard about it and it sounds awful if true.\n\nBut I feel like I also started to really noice that when I was younger.

I also think to a certain point it's also related to what we, generationally, find fun and 'fulfilling at they want in a relationship at all. Men seem to know exactly what they want and will act accordingly. At this stage however, women are either 'test driving' and putting out or are looking for emotional support and that prince charming. Men on the other hand are either on the search for the Highschool Sweetheart turned life partner, or the sex friend...because they haven't figured out you \\*can\\* be friends with benefits rather than a real couple. Neither of us actually know how to communicate this or are playing the game and don't want to let on about it.  \n\n\nThen we get to the actual 'real work' and 'new house smell' stage when we realize we just got excited about buying that new faucet for the kitchen. By this point, you're either still playing the game in some way or looking to settle down just a bit. Most people have an idea of what they want and those high standards you started with have crumbled somewhat. But even beyond that, those snotty kids 5, 10 years younger than you are looking to party and play games cause guess what: they're the new players now. And a lot of times, it's just two different languages. One's getting into college, and the other looking at that manager or even owner position. Your priorities just ain't the same. Another big factor here is just the generational gap. We know the memes, jokes, and stereotypes, but they have a truth inside them and sometimes we just simply don't mesh because of it. However also by this point, a those studies point out, now you have the idiots and gun-jumpers that could be up to 5 kids deep and don't know better along side those that at least have it mostly figured out and wanna be stable before being full-on open. Additionally to that, we now live in the age of online super-connectivity. You know how hard it is to develop meaningful relationships with more than 5 people when your common grounds are facebook posts, memes, and what popular video game you're active on? Throw in that if you're an unlucky or insociable sod like me, you still have no real social skill set at seeking what you want even if you know exactly what you're looking for. And many people now are wrapped up in instant-satisfaction interactions with everything else in life, which relationships 9/10 times just \\*aren't.\\* So the candle burns faster without being hotter/brighter.  \n\n\nThen even further you've got the \\*even older\\* crowd whose coming up or past their 40's who either fall into the \"well fuck it\" or \"am I still sexy?\" groups by an overwhelming majority. I can't speak personally, but from my observations this is where you've got the ride-or-die mentality that is \\*actually\\* ride-or-die, the people that have dropped the game entirely and just want to settle for any romantic relationship and a home, the early death widow/ers or (multi-)divorced, and lastly the mid-life crisis crowd. All of which are done with bullshitting altogether and either snag up the unfaithful, the poly, or know who they can trust and shack up. And that's beside the emergent \"I think it'll never happen so I've thrown in the towel.\" that basically take a miracle to accept any romantic relationship of any kind.  \n\n\nAfter that it all boils down to two groups of \\*old people.\\* The ones that stuck to the game and probably runs some part of the state, or basically don't care and are happy to be with whatever old fart they happen to mutually fancy.  \n\n\nThe people that \\*don't\\* recognize some portion of this usually end up exacerbating the issue by making mini-me's that likewise probably won't catch on, and the people that do either won't find a partner at all or end up shacking up 'late' and won't replicate as much; meaning those more likely to catch on are at a smaller population. I also think to a certain point it's also related to what we, generationally, find fun and 'fullfilling' in what we do. Figure just 30 years ago the only thing \\*to\\* do besides work was to go out and socialize or read a book in some form by yourself. Now we have so many more options than, more or less, finding trouble or taking a ride. And they even tend to be \\*even more\\* entertaining by design, paired with an overall greater expectation that \"just being friends\" is more acceptable as we learn to do away with traditional signs of courtship and new ideas of acceptable identity expression.",

I expected it to lead to marriage, having kids, growing old together, etc, but it ended suddenly with her cheating on me with someone who has been a scab on society's ass for his entire life and I realized this person who had been my best friend for years was a complete stranger to me. On top of cheating, she lied to everyone about the situation and turned friends and family against me. It shook me to my foundation and made me question everything I thought I knew in life. I honestly thought I was losing my mind for a while. The truth eventually came out, though, and karma really came back to bite her on the ass. I've lived a mostly reclusive bachelor life since then and turned my focus toward financial success and personal health, and I feel better and more secure in my future than I ever have.",

It's more to do with how the average man is shown how easily disposable he is. \n\nNow delete the whole app.  Then you can't compare yourself with others whenever you mindlessly unlock your device and ghost-ship onto social media. \n\n> How dating apps have completely ruined the dating market.\n\nThey may enable some of humanity's worst impulses, but that was already happening offline.  Trust me.  \n\nOnline dating is wonderful, and people of ages older-than-you are having a wonderful time.  I think you're finding yourself simply wanting what we're having: An organic, grown-up relationship.   This means you're maturing.  You want substance.  You want meaning, you want true connection, deep relationships... \n\nall of these are the antithesis of social media.  Social media is surface-only , facade, projection,...   it's masturbation. \n\n> The constant feeling of wanting affection all stems from social media. I came to the realisation that I'm doing nothing but wasting my time by talking to girls that only want to talk on Instagram\n\nPreach. \n\n> , but wouldn't even pick up the phone for a call, let alone meet up. It's a waste of time watching their stories and liking their pictures, because that's time and effort that I could be putting towards my hobbies.\n\nThey got what they came for: validation. attention.  They hit and split.  They're the fuckboys of female-dom.  Don't feed the trolls.  \n\nTRUST ME, there are women just absolutely desperate for mature men.  If they do the vapid-validation-daydream to age 40, they're the equivalent of bachelors who think they're so cool that nobody sees their beer bellies and receding hairline.  it's sad, but it's totally preventable. \n\nYou just need to stay patient, and raise your standard.  Be picky as hell.  NEVER kiss (or smash) on a first date.  Guys like you who want to fawn on social media, thinking you have a \"chance\" of hot-girl-summer samester fake girls are a commodity.  Stand out by being you:  expecting MORE.  You can't win that game, so stop playing it.  It's on you. \n\nTell yourself:  You date WOMEN, not girls.  Women who have standards like yours, of those who they would spend time with.  People who grow, and develop.  Only you can be responsible for your outcome.  Put your best self out there, and take yourself seriously.  You decide what you want, and start looking for it.  The moment it's not there, CUT BAIT and move on.  All is fair in love and war.  \n\n> I'm a 23 year old guy, and I don't think this subject is talked about anywhere near as much as it should be. But why is that? This is a problem that will only get worse over time, and the stats for that don't lie either.\n\nEverything you are/were doing is fine.  You just need to be OK with changing yourself, improving yourself, dropping behavior that is no longer working for you, and re-evaluate your core beliefs.  Not change, just re-evaluate.  Whatever you wanted when you were 21 has changed.  The reason we look back on our old selves and think we were stupid ... is that all 18-21 year olds ... (get ready) are pretty stupid.  It's sexy to live like that, but it's just not sustainable. \n\nDon't be afraid to grow up.  There will always, forever, be a hungry market for mature, cerebral, present, authentic people of character.  Be yourself, try to be kind, and be respectful.  \n\nFrom the sounds of it, you ALREADY have this depth.  The worst thing you could do is give up now: you are becoming the finished product, my man!  Be proud of that.",

So I achieved nothing after a month's time.\n\nThen there's just what it feels like is expected of you. You have to be fit, be strong, provide, be accepting of basically everything, be attractive, be good at sex, be good at talking because God knows most women aren't going to do much for conversation, know how to approach, know when to approach, know how to not be perceived as creepy when you approach, and more and more. It's just too much to figure out. I'll never measure up to any of that.\n\nThen it feels like many women aren't worth it anymore. You have OnlyFans running amok, extreme superficiality, feminist zealots, those trying to get a free meal out of you just using you for attention, cheaters that thinks it's okay to cheat, etc.\n\nThen I've got everything wrong with me, or that could be wrong with me. I'm a fat, but can't seem to get it off no matter how little I eat. I'm depressed, and nobody wants to deal with that. I'm unattractive, or I can only assume so because I've only ever been told I'm attractive once and even then I think she was just trying to make me feel better about myself. I've been told I'm uninteresting even though I'm forced to carry almost every conversation. I'm a virgin at 19, which I'm sure isn't doing me any favors. I'm shy.

For me, I wouldn't think I'll go off saying I've given up on dating, but I've certainly put it on the backburner.  I've never been in a relationship but have gone on dates before, but never had any second dates. Simply the top two reasons in my rejection experiences are:\n\n1. There's another dude in the picture. I simply don't chase nor bother talking to her anymore because I don't fucking compete, she can have him.\n2. There was no \"spark\" to begin with. Pretty self explanatory.\n\nAside from my past experiences, I think the top reason on why I'm not really interested in dating is I'm recuperating from an emotional scar from someone I really liked. This spring will mark one year, and I'm STILL recuperating from it.\n\nIf it helps paint a picture of myself, I'm 23, currently reinventing myself by re-enrolling in university (in junior year) with an end goal of making it either in the software/data science world.  So far my life has been consumed with my studies, trying to secure an internship, managing my money, and making time to train for an Ironman triathlon. At this stage in my life I feel that my newfound purpose has consumed my energy and time, which has helped me establish a conversation with women. While I haven't been on any dates, but it's helped not make me look \"boring.\" For what it's worth, I've noticed having a sense of a purpose/goal helps keep you productive in life and as well as meeting people (professionally & socially).\n\nThe moral of my post is to encourage my fellow dudes to find their purpose. Whatever y'all do, be fucking productive. Whether it's professionally or socially, people WILL notice your commitment/dedication to a goal. In addition, maybe it's time to change the mindset when rejection does happen. How I deal with rejection is I have an acronym; I use the word 'No' for 'New Opportunities.'\n\nOther than that, I'm looking forward to the day when I get that piece of paper, go to the bank to collect my money bag; and to call the people I don't like/those who rejected me and tell 'em to get fucked.\n\nCheers Boys",

I've done things I know were wrong to good women that maybe could have been my wife today if I hadn't made the mistakes I did.\n\nBut to answer your question, even the good relationships had large red flags that have put me off the idea of marriage, and by contrast dating in general. The main one for me is that, as a man, I feel that my happiness is never a consideration in the decision making process. As an example, I am expected to constantly \"see things from her perspective\" but she never has to see them from my perspective. For instance I am expected to communicate in a very specific way, as often as possible or at very specific times, to only very specific people, in order to make her feel comfortable. But she never has to give me space (or really do anything I say/want) to make me feel more comfortable.\n\nAnother reason is the large gap in life experience between the man and woman. Generally speaking women date older more experienced and established men, but that means I am expected to date an inexperienced and less established woman. Why am I always the one that is expected to date down the socioeconomic ladder when I'm the provider in the relationship? As an example I need to have a good job to provide a certain quality of life, but that requires a large amount of effort for many many years to obtain a degree or significant work experience. But she makes $35,000 doing \"what makes her happy\". I want her to be happy, but why am I a less attractive partner if I also take a huge pay cut to do what makes me happy?\n\n\nI won't ramble on and on, but essentially it boils down to the fact that I feel like \"happy wife, happy life\" is unfair to me. I also need to be happy and have my needs met. We both deserve to be happy.",

I could talk with a girl for about an hour, but then afterwards have nothing else to talk about. And it always seemed like I was doing all the talking: all the  while I had to figure out in my mind \"is she interested? Is she liking my conversation? Should I joke about this? Did I go too far? When can I ask her if she is in a relationship? Should I ask her to meet again?\" And then I had to figure out if she showed me a hint of attraction towards me. All the while, the girl never seemed to input anything in the conversation.\n\nIt's unfortunate that men are always expected to make the first move, to carry the conversation; and recently, for men to be aware if they are being creepy or harassing women, even if it was just a casual conversation. And men always have to ask directly \"would you like to go out? Can we exchange phone numbers\"?\n\nIt's not women's fault, but our society still believes that men should be the ones to take the lead. And to put it simply, it's a lot of pressure for men to deal with. And when you hear in the media and society saying that men should be more respectful in dating, it's always on men, never on women. Think about it this way, what is harder: to muster the courage to talk to someone, to keep the conversation going, to be aware of what you say, read body language, to put the effort even if you fail, keep trying until you make it; or simply saying \"sorry, I'm not interested\"? Chances are men always do the former and women the latter. \n\nYoung men are giving up in dating because it's a lot of pressure: they are expected to take the lead but always in a way that isn't creepy or harassing, so they have to be aware of what to say and how to act. It's a lot of mental gymnastics and mentally exhausting. And even if they managed to find a woman to date, women can easily dispose of them; and men have to accept it and give up. It's a lot of effort and a lot of work that doesn't seem to pay off: and if that's the case then why date at all?",

            "text": "I certainly can't speak to what young men are or are not doing, but I can tell you my story if you like. \n\nMy last girlfriend and I were together for 8 years. Most of it, things seemed pretty good. I took everything I learned from my 40 years (at the time) and was going to give it one last chance to end up happy with someone. We knew one another in school, so we had history. We both kinda liked one another back then, but it never worked out. She was dating someone when I was single, I was dating when she was single. You know how high school goes. So we go our separate ways after high school, then reconnect via Facebook in our early 40's. Sounds like a romance novel, right? Well it kinda was for a while, or so it seemed. We got on really well. Dated, then dated exclusively, then were fully committed to ending up married and together \"someday\". We figured at some point in our mid 40's provided we kept clicking so well. \n\nThings go along, life happens, everything seems fine. She has bad times, I offer support. She needs things, I try to provide. I tried everything I know to keep her interested, try to be everything a woman says they want. Supportive, emotionally available. I try to do that thing where women say they just want to be heard without me trying to fix their problems (believe me, this is hard for us but I did it). I had her back in every way I knew how. \n\nSo why is she my Ex instead of my wife? No idea, she dumped me with a text message after 8 years of dedication. I know I'm not perfect, neither was she, but I really feel like I listened, tried to adapt to her needs, tried to be the best boyfriend I could be. Tried to be the best boyfriend anyone could have been. But for all that effort, for 8 years of support and openness and allowing myself to be vulnerable and love again... I was dumped in a text. And one has to say, it can't escape my notice that when I was doing well financially and she was in need I was happy to provide. When things got tough for me and I didn't have a ton of disposable income anymore and needed to tighten my belt for a while, suddenly she needed \"time\" followed by silence and the eventual dumping. \n\nSo I ask you, how can anyone even try in this modern world? I really feel like everything was going right for us, and it ended in the worst heartbreak of my life. And I've been married and divorced. This was way worse. I still love her. I still desire her. But I've got 8 years of memories that destroy me if I so much as ponder them. I had to stop going to Facebook because all my \"memories\" were of she and I and our time together and even after turning off the feature, they still kept popping them up. \n\nSo yeah, I'll be alone. It sucks and I'd rather have a partner, but I'll never try again. Even if I wanted to, it wouldn't be fair to a potential partner to carry this much damage and baggage into something new. You can't love someone if you don't trust them and you can't trust someone if you're not willing to be vulnerable. And while I'd never be a person who says \"all women are (pick your nastiness of choice)\", I will never be vulnerable with another woman. I'm older anyway and out of shape 50 year old Gen-Xers are hardly in demand, so it's not like there's a line leading to my door. But even if there were, I'd close that door and go play XCOM. At least I know how to win in that game.",

Nowadays that is something totally out of the ordinary for the common Western woman. I now realize that I really don't care for super expensive trips or clothes any Clout on social media when it comes to me enjoying life in peace plus recently my homeboy got engaged to this crazy chick and things turn for the worse oh, I miss hanging with him like we used to it's not the first time that a relationship took my best friend away from me I've been single for almost five years and honestly in today's society in generation I'm better off that way I don't want kids I have plenty of nieces and nephews an extended family that know me well and I love them, marriage I've lost all faith in but I'm not sad about it I never really saw it as a priority in life or anything good really considering all the older men who have told me don't get married, I mean as a kid you can say you don't want to get married and then people say that you will anyways however once you become an adult and you look past the bullshit pretty lie that is the wedding and look at the ugly devastating truth that is the divorce and losing all your shit possibly being put in jail if you have kids and can't afford to pay the child support that puts the kbosh on that decision. To be honest I have more trust in a woman if she was my girlfriend or side piece then if she was my wife or baby mama and we're married, cuz if she's my girlfriend I'm really not fully committed to her I'm just with her so if she wants to leave or if I want to leave I'm totally free by law but as a wife I have to go through all this legal bulshit with the courts especially if we had a kid.

            "text": "Society, culture, work/life balance, mental health. There's a huge list of reasons why men give up on dating. My personal belief is that the internet, and the ability to stay anonymous and not have repercussions in your personal life due to crappy behavior online contribute highly to this. \n\nPrior to online dating taking off, you had extremely limited avenues for meeting potential partners, and because of this, it was important to take dating seriously if you ever wanted to settle down. Folks might have access to a dating pool at their school, work, or hobbies. But other than that it was slim, humans talk to other humans, so if someone was treated poorly, it would shrink the dating pool significantly, then you'd have to go out of your way to find new social circles to find more potential partners. In this way, people were pressured from a societial POV to take dating seriously. Otherwise you'd find yourself alone with no one wanting you.\n\nThen internet dating happened. It started small, and was stigmatized to the point most people would lie about meeting partners online, but it was only a small group of people that dated online. Usually folks who worked overnight, or travelled alot for their jobs, etc. Then tinder happened. And our entire society started to undergo major changes. All of a sudden the whole world was open to you. And you could indicate desire and interest without any repercussions or social skills. Just a left or right swipe. Ghosting became a thing, as did a huge increase in hookups and ONS. Because who cares, you could always find someone else next week, no big deal. And the best part, it required almost zero energy to do this, you could date from your couch, toilet, or even at work. Interpersonal skills dropped importance in society, and in many peoples personal lives. They were more \"free\" to act however they wanted and impulsively without fear of social circles crashing down on them.\n\nAround this same time, women started having a huge increase in attention and the number of potential partners exploded. Whereas before, as either a woman, or a gay man you had an extremely limited selection of men you were interested in, which lowered their dating pool dramatically. Many women only had a couple of people they'd consider as potential partners, as it took far too much time and energy to expand or gather new avenues for the search in partners. Now though, men are lined up, out the front doors with resumes and applications in hand. Women open their dating apps and see hundreds of interested men daily. It didn't matter if they were Barbies, goths, loners, anime lovers, nerds, or animal people. All of a sudden they had this massive influx of potential partners. They can afford to be extremely picky now. There's no way they can get to every interested party, they have to filter them somehow. The most common filters are outward appearance, religion, estimated income range, and hobbies.\n\nSo at this point we have all genders/etc ghosting, hooking up, doing one night stands, and other crappy behavior. We also have females and other genders/etc being extremely picky and selective. Well now, everything comes to a boil. People are getting their feelings hurt from investing time, energy, and emotions, other people are having a grand ol' time being uninterested in commitment, and everything just kind of smashes together until most of the dating pool is sick and tired of other people, their crap that they pull, and the time and energy spent talking, or trying to talk to all these potential partners. Then throw in the fact that all dating apps gate things by ridiculous amounts of money, by preying on lonely people, and they don't remove inactive profiles, and that huge dating pool you think you're getting into, is really just a shallow kiddie pool now. Meanwhile the women/other genders still get hundreds of messages, and now men/other genders are wasting all their time and money trying to find real/active profiles.  I.e. it only made the problems worse. And because this has been going on for a decade, many of the younger generation, they don't know \"how\" to date without the internet. They don't have the social skills necessary, and honestly because of internet dating, it's much more creepy now to ask people you're interested in out in person. Ever try to talk to a girl at a bar now? She's got 4 friends there and they'll all tell you to screw off even if you're asking where the restroom is. No joke.\n\nThrow in Instagram, twitch, and only fans, and women have tons of business opportunities to make a living without working a \"normal\" job. And many treat it as a job, because it is. So where does this leave us?\n\nMen/other genders are spending more time trying to find a partner than ever before, to the point where it can be like a second job, unless they're extremely attractive and/or rich. And women/other genders are getting swarmed with potential partners, while others are trying to promote their businesses one way or another. Ghosting still happens, cheating still happens, etc, etc.\n\nSo, why are young men throwing in the towel? Because online dating sucks. It's horrible for your mental health that you're only as valuable as the replies you get, and even a good looking or average dude will easily find themselves depressed or burnt out. Women get stuck with tons of people fighting for attention, they get screwed over by people just looking for sex, etc. And for the younger generation, no one knows how to date outside of online, and it's now considered creepy or weird by social norms to ask people out.\n\nCombined with other stresses like extremely high rent, low wages, out of control inflation, no government help unless you're a mother... yeahhhhh. Why bother? If you're life is going to be depressing and sad anyways, why put more energy you don't have into something that won't happen?\n\nThat's where we are as a society. That's a big reason birth rates are so low.",

Totally worth the few painful encounters where they laugh at you or say something hurtful.\n\nSo ya, I totally understand why people would give it up.

I'm on the younger part of the spectum of users here, being 18 turning 19, but I don't see a point of dating at all. \n\nI recognize I'm biased, as I have basically no female friends, and have never dated anyone before. I don't go to parties, and I'm currently taking a gap year from covid, as I find online school absolutely abhorrent. \n\nAnyway, I don't see a point in attempting online dating, or dating at all, because it's a luck of the draw that appears to be consistently unfavorable for men.\n\n I think I don't look particularly bad, I keep clean, I shave, make sure my breath doesn't stink, I'm 6'1, pretty skinny and I think I'm a solid 5 outta 10. \n\nI don't hold any radical political views either. \n\n\n\nLiterally no women my age/generation have ever gone up and directly talked to me. Ever.\n\n\n\nAnd so what what do I think?\n\n\"What are the requirements for beginning a relationship?\"\n\n\n\nAnd I think the requirements seem to be fairly oriented towards men initiating a conversation. You put in some effort, have a near random chance that said effort is reciprocal, and then that's it. You just put in effort and roll the slots to strike up a conversation to maybe get a date, if the person doesn't think you're a total creep. That's all there is. You can get multiple results, including being ignored, people fishing for effort, people who don't want to commit to anything, unfaithful people. A mixed bag of potential.\n\n\n\nI have my own mental health issues, which include ADHD, and I do admit to being nervous around women. I'm basically the opposite of confident. I fidget and twitch like a dog with fleas. I'm definitely not even halfway to perfect.\n\n\n\nBut I can't shake the idea that, mechanically, you roll the dice of dating like a gacha. There's a feeling like there's a 1% chance you actually find someone who you can even be friends with, let alone romantically connect with. \n\n\n\nAnd with dating requiring money to initiate, I simply don't care. From what I understand, and, please correct me if I'm flawed, if you want to date, the guy is expected to pay for the first date.\n\nThat seems excessively wasteful for the amount of effort. Others in this thread mention various statistics, but there's more than a good chance you meet someone who just doesn't want a relationship. \n\n\n\nIt's a whole lotta experience gain with no results for the costs of time and money.\n\nIf I want to waste time for 1% odds, I'd rather play an acutal gacha game. I don't have to be anywhere, I don't have to put in an unequally skewed amount of effort in for initiating. I get rewarded with an equal amount of dopamine for spending the same two things, time and effort, and none of the stress.\n\n\n\nNote that I don't actually spend money on gacha games, I spend it on LEGO instead.\n\n\n\nThere's little gain for plenty of pain, worry and stress, I don't think I'm ready for that, for basically few to no results. I'm not here to guess a game or dance a jig for a single person, who could more than likely just up and leave before they even actually get to know me.\n\n\n\nIt's not worth it. I'm not worried because it's not worth it. My views will probably change with time an experience, but as for now, I don't care. I'd rather do my own thing then be judged by someone else, who, statistically, isn't interested.\n\n\nIt's sad, but it's how it is. \n\n\nHave a good rest of your day, and get some good rest.\n\n-SirSquid22",

It's going to take a toll on your self esteem if you're not one of the really good looking, attractive guys who's getting a lot of right swipes. And I don't think you'll ever form a genuine connection on apps where people are constantly pretending to be more badass, sassy, important, etc than they actually are.\nIt's the case for a lot of guys who are just giving up on such technology.\n\nIt's turned into a game. Every woman knows how easy it is for her to get a guy on Tinder. She has plenty of options and will always choose the better one. There's also the issue of safety and self preservation for women. \n\nI think it's great that you're spending more time on your hobbies. Do whatever it is that you enjoy, stay fit, have fun with friends and maybe if you meet someone you strike some chemistry with, you can date them. Meeting people organically through friends or through a shared hobby is probably much better to find a date than it is on Tinder.",

Who wants to waste their time, money, emotions, and energy just for it to be reciprocated with complete disrespect, when all we really want is a loyal respectful and respectable woman to grow with as a partnership with the goal of happiness. I'm not saying all women are like this, but I'm now in my 30s and haven't found one who isn't.

About 2 years ago I went dark on all social media (except Reddit, obviously) and haven't looked back since. Every once in a while I'll pop into Instagram to reply to a DM, and along the way I'll see some engagement/wedding/baby/other major life event pictures from my old \"friends\". And I'll realize that they aren't really my friends, just another person I used to know. My friends are the ones who keep in touch with me in real life, the ones who call and text and go out of their way to speak to *me*, not just expect me to keep up when they broadcast their status to the world.\n\nOf course relationships are two way streets, it would be horribly narcissistic to expect people to get in touch with you if you aren't putting any effort into keeping in touch with them. But if a person hasn't made any attempt to reciprocate your attention, it's time to leave them behind. I'm not just talking about dating here, but friendships as well.\n\nInterestingly, I had pretty good success on tinder when I tried it. I'm not especially attractive, I'd consider myself a 6.5/10. But I just tried to be genuine, kind, and not give a flying fuck what anyone thought about me. I matched with a few great girls and went on some nice dates, nothing that really lasted though. I just stayed ambiguous and tried not to care whether a relationship started or ended, whether or not dates or sex happened. I've found that the less I care about something, the easier it is to achieve. Not just in relationships but in business and life goals too. It's a bit paradoxical, but just try to learn not to care about being in a relationship. Eventually, you'll probably wind up in one. Of course you'll still have to get out and meet new people. But just try to make friends and don't be sexual, at worst you'll make new friends, at best you'll come off as mysterious and unavailable, which drives your social value through the roof.

I'm tall, fit, have my own apartment, and making well into the six figures.  The truth is that dating is a struggle in certain geographic areas because women have changed culturally and the rise of dating apps and social media have given them inflated egos.  They have unreasonably high expectations and if you don't check even one of their boxes you'll be passed over.\n\nPart of the reason for this is that American women in general have just let themselves go so that the remaining attractive ones are in short supply and high demand.  They can get what they want when they want it and they all know it.  Go swipe on Hinge and see just how many dozens of physically repulsive obese women you have to go through just to a chance of a decent match.  If you go swipe on Tinder you'll get pretty much no matches because it's just a meat market with an algorithm designed to torture you.  \n\nI would highly recommend anyone in here who lives in the western world go visit other countries and see how radically different the male and female dynamic is as well as how women take care of themselves. Do an experiment and get a one month subscription to Tinder plus and set your location to Medellin and just see how many gorgeous women that wouldn't even look at you in your own area will like you and be absolutely ecstatic at the chance to just go out on a date.  Just go visit that city and look around to be awestruck at how common the drop-dead gorgeous and friendly women are.  It's in their culture to take care of themselves physically and just have pleasant personalities in general.  It's honestly shocking how radically different it is in cultures where women are taught to be feminine and not embrace obesity and aggressive attitudes.  I'm generalizing this to Colombia but there's plenty of places where you will have much better luck romantically with much less effort.  \n\nIf you're young take the opportunity to go travel, drink, and fuck top quality women.  Don't lament that you can't get a second rate woman that's just a divorce waiting to happen.\n\nThe harsh reality is that we have a defective culture where men are just seen as commodities and women don't give a shit about self-maintenance or having a pleasant personality, but it's not like that everywhere.\n\nOP you are absolutely right for unfollowing instagram hoes.  You mean nothing to these worthless talentless morons other than just another instagram follower to boost their ego even higher.  Be part of the solution, not the problem.",

Partner or not, it‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs also okay to create intimacy with non romantic partners. \n\nWomen are very socialized to dream about their ‚ÄúPrince Charming‚Äù, and I‚Äôve seen it drastically and dramatically impact so many badass women in my life who think they‚Äôre/ life is worthless without romantic love. From what I‚Äôve read from lurking around reddit for way too long, it seems like men are also taught to dream to be a ‚Äúprince charming‚Äù. I think the pressure on both sides of the aisle is completely decimating anyone‚Äôs chance. We‚Äôre so tied up in making one person try to fulfill so much, both genders stop putting effort into seeking intimacy in other ways (close friendships, etc). \n\nSo for all the men who need to hear this: it‚Äôs okay to enjoy your life without a partner. It‚Äôs okay to seek and cultivate intimacy with friends. Sex isn‚Äôt everything. A boyfriend/girlfriend isn‚Äôt everything. You might even find that spending all that energy you previously put into fulfilling a fairy tale into discovering your own identity and happiness eventually leads you to exactly what you‚Äôre looking for relationship wise. \n\nBut while we‚Äôre all trying so hard to fulfill a fairy tale that only exists in books and movies, I think we‚Äôre all going to continue to be pretty fucked.",

            "text": "There‚Äôs no one size fits all answer to this because every guy who is choosing to forego dating has their own reasons and chances are they have more than one but I‚Äôll explain my reasonings.\n\nI‚Äôm college educated which is usually seen as a positive but it also means I have a lot of student loan debt. I work steadily enough to pay my expenses but most of my money leftover goes to paying off my student loans and investing (so I can pay off my loans earlier). Dating means I‚Äôd have to spend extra money that I could be using for paying off my debt and whenever I‚Äôm dating someone, I‚Äôm usually spending an extra few hundred a month. It makes more sense financially for me to just be single and focus on myself since it‚Äôs the norm for the male to pay for most dating expenses in a typical heterosexual relationship.\n\nAfter using dating apps on and off for years since 2013, I‚Äôve noticed how much dating apps have gone down hill over time. Seems like there‚Äôs significantly more women than men on there which creates a dynamic in which mate selection heavily favors women but is discouraging for most men. My female friends would get dozens of matches within hours of swiping while my male friends (some of whom are charming and attractive) would be swiping for weeks but only get a few matches. Not only that but the amount of women who make height a make it or break it factor made me realize that a lot of women on there are superficial and my chances are low since I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô10. I no longer use dating apps because it‚Äôs just a waste of time swiping for hours only to get a few matches who either don‚Äôt reply or just want me to subscribe to their only fans.\n\nFor years asian men have been portrayed in a negative light so a lot of women don‚Äôt find Asian men attractive. I‚Äôm Asian but I‚Äôm pretty lucky because I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm relatively attractive and I even book steady work in the film industry and modeling industry but the stigma still persists so my dating options are a bit limited, especially in more conservative areas.\n\nThe pandemic changed my dating outlook too. Because I have to get covid tested for every gig I do, that means I have to be more careful. If i book a big role but I test positive, then I‚Äôd most likely be recasted. Most dates aren‚Äôt worth risking a potential gig that pays my bills and leads to more career opportunities.\n\nDating also takes a lot of time and effort and there‚Äôs always an opportunity cost. In 2020 I was dating someone but I was helping her out with her issues so much that I stopped focusing on my career and investing that I missed out on lucrative opportunities. I literally missed out on some great investments that would‚Äôve allowed me to pay off my student loans.\n\nMy recent ex girlfriends wanted to settle down and wanted to do it quickly but if I‚Äôm going to be real with myself, I‚Äôm just not there yet so I‚Äôd rather not get anyones hopes up and waste their time. There‚Äôs so much I wanna do in life that I haven‚Äôt gotten to, like traveling around the world and dating girls in different countries. And when I am ready to settle down, I kinda want to settle down with a girl who isn‚Äôt from America so it would make sense for me to travel more before choosing someone to settle down with.\n\nAnd to be honest, in the first time in my life I‚Äôm actually content with being single. For years it felt like my happiness was dependent on whether I was dating someone. And if you‚Äôve every been in a toxic relationship, then you know how liberating it feels to be single even it means not having someone to be intimate and affectionate with. But I can honestly say that I love myself enough to the point where I don‚Äôt need someone to love me for me to be happy. It may sound crazy to some people and I don‚Äôt expect most people to understand that because I believe a lot of people use dating as a crutch to make themselves happy.\n\nAlso I noticed that if I just focus on myself and my genuine passions and interests, it attracts people. I have enough faith to know that if I just focus on being a better person and growing into the person I aspire to be, I‚Äôll attract potential lovers even if I‚Äôm not actively looking. It could take months or years but I‚Äôm pretty patient and confident.\n\nThere‚Äôs probably more reasons I can‚Äôt think of right now but I just think dating and relationships aren‚Äôt as important as people make it out to be. If you truly love yourself, then you‚Äôll never go a day without feeling loved.",

I don't usually reply here but for this one I couldn't help myself, cause this screams out to me as bad for humanity, men included.\n\nI think it's been a long time coming, in a really sad way. Way way back, it used to be a woman needs to give a man what he wants in a housewife, he was free to choose the job, house, how he spent free time and she was meant to provide sons, cook dinner and clean the house. As history progressed women got more rights and the genders leveled out in relationships but neither side forgot. For a long time a woman was judged harshly on how she looked and acted, makeup choices, clothes, social performance. That's not to say there weren't unfair expectations on men as well, be the breadwinner, be stoic and unemotional, play the \"mans\" role in society. But women (in a societal sense) never forgot, which plays into the next part.\n\nPersonally I feel at that stage things got to fairly even footing, obviously there were still people on both sides who held on to old beliefs or history-driven opinions, not necessarily a bad thing but fuel none the less for when social media took rise. There's so much pressure put on both sides to be perfect, women are told to be more and expect more, to not accept less than perfect because that's what is perpetuated everywhere around us. People can visually sculpt their lives to appear however they want it to. Other women see this over and over, everywhere, for years and eventually, in society, it becomes normal to expect that as reality. So, she turns down the normal guys. In a world where guys are finally allowed to be themselves and express personality and emotion, the world has been set up for that to fail. Women are left disappointed because the perfect man they expect to find doesn't seem to exist, men and up disappointed because women won't give them the time of day because they aren't Hercules. Everyone loses. People retreat in sadness. Obviously not everyone falls into the above mould but enough people do that its having this impact. \n\nBut, I'm just a woman in a man's sub, and these are just my thoughts, so take this as you will.",

I can‚Äôt blame them given a lot of the creepy shot they have to deal with but it‚Äôs still a contributor / discouraging for young men. \n\nAnother thing to add is are you willing to meet people through mutual friends. Personally, I don‚Äôt want my friends (especially my female friends) to know my dating business so this can create more of an obstacle tbh. \n\nI‚Äôd say look for other avenues for meeting women. It may make more time but is worth the effort. Don‚Äôt be afraid to put yourself out there and if they say no, take it with dignity and be proud of yourself for trying. \n\nI am with you fellas, I totally feel discouraged but want to do more dating.

Many women have this idea of dating as actually going out in expensive dates pretty often and having a nice time which requires spending a lot of money over the course. I'm not shaming it or anything, I get it, everyone wants the nice things in life but in short, dating isn't an option for me because of the lack of money and free time. I am expected by my family to be working my ass off to prepare for job interviews which is what I'm currently doing. I hope I don't end up as a low wage worker because that sure would do enough by itself to prevent women from considering to date me. \n\nAgain, there are some rich 19 year olds who can wear nice clothes and spend their rich parent's money in going to places or buying gifts for their partners while dating, which I unfortunately don't fall into.

            "text": "I think this problem has gotten worse in the last 2 years due to COVID.  Girls have an easy excuse if they don't feel like going out.  Going out to the types of places you would meet a girl (like a club) are less common.  Even if you do go to a bar, people are probably in their own groups and don't want to mingle.\n\nBefore that, I would say there are two major things that made it more difficult to date.\n\nThe first, as you mention, is online dating.  There's a big ratio of guys-to-girls.  Lots of the girls are bots, which means the ratio is horrible for guys.  Lots of the guys are jerks.  Lots of the real girls are pushed away because they get spammed (often by jerks).  On top of that, a lot of girls are just there to flirt or to get attention, and they have no intention of actually meeting someone.  It can be tough finding someone who actually wants a relationship, and finding them before one of the other guys gets a date (and since it's like a 10:1 ratio, that's a small window).\n\nThe second is the modern feminist movements, some of which is good for society, some of which has been bad for dating.  On the one hand, it's good that we have a better awareness of sexual harassment and sexual assault.  But it's also made guys evaluate not just if a girl is into them or not, but if the girl is going to immediately claim you're harassing her, just because you dared to express interest.  They say the worst thing a girl can say is, \"no\", but she can also loudly yell, \"EW! Get away from me you creep!\"  Not only is that a blow to your self-esteem, but it also ruins your chances with any other girl in earshot.\n\nA third issue, which I don't think is super new, but maybe is worse with social media, is ghosting.  What will happen is someone will make plans with different people, and only keep the one that sounds the most fun.  I've heard this has been going on forever (my Mom remembers it happening in the 60s).  But with social media, we have free instant communication to a variety of people.  So I think that's gotten worse.\n\nThen there's the idea that less people want to date.  Now, you start off with \"hanging out\" instead of \"dating\".",

This is because they stand me up, sometimes they apologize but most of the time I just get ghosted. I got irritated the first few times but then I got used to it. And this is by no means \"all women\" it's just this dating app culture that has come to fruition.\n\nIf I sit down and treat the dating app like my part time job I can maybe get 100 matches in a month. This is swiping on everyone. Of those 100, I unmatch about 25 for various reasons like... matching with a dude, distance over 1500 miles, bot account, or no pictures. From that 75 I get about 30ish responses to pointed compliments or pointed comments about their profile pics/bio. Of those 30 I get maybe 2 to call, and every once in a while I will get one of those to agree to a date like going to the zoo, concert, wine tasting or something more casual if they insist.\n\nBut like I said I always plan a day out for myself just in case they stand me up. Since graduating school in late 2019 I haven't actually had any romantic relations and have been stood up maybe 5-8 times? It's hard to keep count. But I did get to go chill at the zoo and some other fun places alone that normally wouldn't have gone to.\n\nThis has helped me realize that I don't need to date to be happy, and I have stopped trying to have anything other than friendly relations with the opposite sex.\n\nThe worst part of all this is having female friends find out about this and them criticizing my character as the reason for getting stood up. \"Are you sure it isn't something you said?\" \"I bet you creeped them out\". Hearing that is kind of a blow to my confidence. So now I don't even hangout with them.\n\nMaybe I show some red flags and that is why I get stoodup. I wish I could have someone point out my flaws. Then I could at least work on them. I make enough money, I keep clean, I think I dress nice, I can hold conversation just fine and I workout too, so I don't think any of the usual reasons give a tell for why I'm getting stoodup.\n\nI realize no one will read this but, it does feel pretty good to whine on the internet.",

After looking and hearing I find myself in complete disdain, husbands ignoring their wife's wants and needs, wives talking to other girls behind their husband's backs gossiping. This and other things I have noticed have scared me, people who I thought had great marriages equivalent to what I had growing up are nothing more than one spouse tolerating the other's behaviors. \n\nThe other thing that prevents me from dating is a sermon I watched by pastor Rick Warren. His video goes into depth about choosing the correct person to marry and what you need to fix before you get married. After viewing that video I can tell you that I am not ready to find a good girlfriend and if I did right now find a girlfriend I would be awful to her. Maybe not intentionally but unintentionally and I need to figure out what that could be before I could ever think about dating.\n\nThere are a lot of things that people never consider when dating/marrying and it scares me to death that I could hurt my future wife in any way shape or form.

Some people know they are damaged goods and would be a drain in a relationship so they just avoid it altogether, others are simply afraid or unwilling to have children. Some are clinging to their potential, rather than see it realized and set in stone.\n\nOn the other hand because the world seems so much larger due to the internet, people feel like they have more options and higher standards, so they over look what once would have become their only dating pool. There is also all the horror stories out there about failed relationships, and the risk of doing to your kids what your parents did to you.\n\nPersonally I had a rough childhood (Alcohol/Hard drugs, violence, gun violence, moved around a lot, etc) that made me realize if I was to be in a relationship it would have to be legit, she would need to be someone I loved dearly, someone I could even consider marrying or having children with and growing old together, someone I could trust and rely on, and her trust and rely on me.\n\nI found her, but life isn't so simple, as I was not prepared for that and it was a spectacular dumpster fire fueled by me knowing she was the one but I didn't and would never have a shot with her.

I think both lads and ladies are seeing the top 10% or worse on these apps. And I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs true for gay people as well.\n\nI can‚Äôt speak to what you are going through. But I can tell you before apps I didn‚Äôt have an easy time picking women up. My hypothesis is that the middle group of people, normal looking, average with reasonable expectations are not finding each other. Everyone is getting stuck in an echo chamber. \n\nThe advice about ditching the apps is probably the best. Social media is all about presenting a curated life. Not about the diarrhea you just had from a gas station burrito. But real life has pants shitting (peeing for ladies) and laundry. I had no success in my dating days picking someone up. All my relationships were friends of friends. That may not be true for everyone just giving you one path.\n\nI think getting involved with a new friend group is one path I can offer, not the only way. It worked for me several times. You make a core group of friends but don‚Äôt stop being open to new ones. If you start a new hobby, or find new people that share your hobby you expand your circle. And there‚Äôs inherent trust when you meet new people in these circumstances. \n\n Advice section: (may or may not be helpful)\nVideo games are your comfort activity. Don‚Äôt stop doing it but you have to get a little uncomfortable and make a change. If you aren‚Äôt leaving your house at all find something you can do once a week that you enjoy for yourself. But then try to meet some people who also enjoy it. Anything at all, art, music, sports, bird watching. But make sure it‚Äôs something you enjoy. The execution might be really hard for the introverts, so find another introvert. Or whatever, make it fit your life as you live it. But new friends is how you make those connections. Sisters and friends are out there (adapt as needed).\n\nWhen I was young, all the things I thought I wanted in a partner aren‚Äôt the things that were correct. All the experiences with rejection and break ups were critical to personal growth. But it would appear the app matches are not based on anything real, which is probably why they aren‚Äôt working. Connections create bonds. But those connections can be anything really. Friends are made by location when you are in school. But then bonding with people over shared interests takes over. After school is over, work isn‚Äôt a great place to meet people imo. It‚Äôs the adult ‚Äúextra curricular‚Äù activities. Take a current friend with you, so you aren‚Äôt alone. Bring an extrovert with you that lets you shine.\n\nI think I‚Äôm an extrovert so I‚Äôm trying to offer alternatives. Look for the person who isn‚Äôt digging the vibe at a party/event and commiserate. Maybe a new bond or a new friend group.\n\nGood luck out there! I think there‚Äôs a lot of positives with how people are getting to know themselves. There‚Äôs like minded people out there it can be hard to find your tribe.",

I'm the one doing all the work, and I get maybe a modicum of that energy back. So so so so so many girls I talk to for online dating give me one word responses. What am I supposed to do about that? Literally last week, a girl I was talking to, who responded to my 3 paragraph introduction with an lol and a couple of lines, talked to me for an afternoon, and at the first lapse in conversation - you know, those comfortable silences that naturally occure when you talk to someone - she said, and I quote \"Okay. I'm bored. You can go now\". \nActually, she said it ruder, but as I blocked her afterwards I can't pull up the screenshot. This was from here, on reddit r4r. I just felt... not human. And I don't ever want to feel that way again.\n\nAnd when I call them out on it, so often I get called the asshole because apparently I'm not being understanding of their anxiety.

Case in point, when the women I talk to pull out the anxiety card and I give them the ol depression uno reverse, I get no compassion and often a times just straight up blocked and ghosted.\n\nSo yeah. I end up in a worse place than where I started. Irl dating is horrible too, because every person who I chat up and ask out for a movie or a dinner either has a boyfriend or considers me as not attractive enough (not my words, what I've been told), and I have this thing where I don't just ask out every single woman I see who walks and breathes.

At this point, I look forward to leading a lonely life because the agony of loneliness is certainly better than the pain of heartbreak.",

It's a very sophisticated tool we use to transmit porn, pictures of cats and memes, but it is still a tool. Using it as anything more is not worth your time. The fundamental problem with trying to meet someone on an internet platform designed around endlessly novel content, borderline narcissism simulations and mass, macro scale communication is that you're going to discover that the math works against everyone. You, the person expected to initiate with other people, are going to discover in a hurry that it is very hard to get anyone's attention, and even harder to hold it just because you're one person among potentially tens and hundreds of thousands of people. Most of the time you will just get ignored, and it's not going to be for malicious reasons. Women get attention fired at them out of the barrel of a cannon. If it were you, you'd be doing the same thing because there's no way to pay attention to each of 10,000 people shooting text messages at you, at least half of which proclaiming that you are the apple of their eye. \n\n\nSecond problem, we've basically killed the idea of the date, but still treat *sex* as some mark on the totem pole. People really want you to know that sex isn't important, but it's still a game some people have access to and some people get a cold shoulder on. And then the same people who tell you it's not important will have, at some point, absolutely used the phrase, 'virgin' as a pejorative. And this isn't me being some crazy conspiracy nutter- it's a matter of statistics that people are having more sex, but few people are actually having it. And way too many people talk out of both sides of their mouth on the subject.\n\n\nThird problem, hyper individualized societies don't treat any form of personal investment in a relationship as 'healthy' or even just expected. People get into relationships for the worst reasons, stay away from others for even worse reasons, and then when they've spent their entire life living like a rolling stone they wonder why they're so miserable. They treat relationships like they're shopping for a pet dog and at the slightest indication that things are not perfect, they walk away. People would rather marry their jobs and careers rather than form families (note: Because someone will object, no, I do not mean having children. If you do not want to have kids, having kids is not a smart idea. Found family is every bit as valid as the kind you pop out) and then wonder what happened when it turned out their job was just means to an end. \n\n\nFourth, despite claims to the contrary, society doesn't want you doing any of this. It treats dating as a burden, marriage as a bigger burden, and having kids as an impossible burden. And this does cut both ways- politicians don't want to pay for your kids but they'll make sure their senior citizen voters get cheap and easy access to boner pills while reminding you that just having a child, at least in the US, costs as much as a car.

To be honest, it‚Äôs actually pretty cut and dry, very simple:\n\n- The numbers game on dating apps is *fucked*. Seriously, if you don‚Äôt believe me, compare the likes you have with a female friend who has a dating app. It‚Äôs not even *close*. Hell, you want to know how crazy the ratio is? Set your preferences to men and women (or everyone, whatever the setting happens to be). Just wait. Men are just far more numerous on dating apps. It‚Äôs like an entire school of fish fighting for two scraps of bread.\n\n- In general, online dating is actually clunky. *Extremely* counterintuitive. Sure, it might put everyone out there in front of you, but it also ruins the individuality and emotional connection. People (especially after you spend enough time on a dating app) become shortlists of desirable and undesirable traits, if they even have that much on their profile. It becomes exhausting and unfulfilling, and even when you do match it‚Äôs the same game of ‚Äútry to find common ground with this complete stranger.‚Äù\n\n- In general, women tend to be pickier. Way pickier. Again, switch your profile to be shown to men and you‚Äôll see a massive difference. I‚Äôm an average looking guy at best, and doing so took me from around 6 likes to over 100 in a day. Women have a lot of suitors to choose from, and as such get swayed to being insanely picky. And why shouldn‚Äôt they? They have an entire menu to pick from and no end in potential candidates. However, this results in the men not at the top of the list being continually ignored or rejected.\n\n- Finally, the big one: dating sucks. It *sucks*. Not necessarily when you find that right person, but the process of finding that one. Dates with people are expensive, time-consuming, and often unfulfilling. I‚Äôve been on dates with at least a dozen people since I broke up with my ex two years ago, and not one of them has gone anywhere. It‚Äôs disheartening, I‚Äôll admit, and the process of searching has caused nothing but disappointment. Why should men want to subject themselves to that? In the eyes of many (myself included) it‚Äôs just far more rational to ignore dating entirely and focus on more productive or positive things in life.",

Dating apps ruined everything because they allow women to have a much broader view of the market and to sift through many men. Previously, women had access to whichever guys could be found in 3 local pubs. Now they have access to every guy in a 100 mile radius. So of course they will be picky. This creates additional psychological moment for women - the fear of losing out. Even if they go on a date with a solid guy, they know they are a swipe away from an even better guy! Why settle for an 8 when a 9 could come tomorrow. \n\nThis is, of course, unsustainable for women. They can‚Äôt all date the 1% most desirable men on the market. And as time goes on, women will have to become disillusioned with the White Horse & Prince concept as they too will become lonely. They will want to start a family, need help in the household, etc. \n\nI think what‚Äôs currently happening is the decline and disillusionment with dating apps, which will culminate when lots of women on the dating apps approach 30 and wake up in an empty bed.",

Not all guys but a lot of them have this kind of quiet desperation about them. It doesn't feel like they're having fun it feels like they're holding onto a rope over the edge of a cliff and I'm the only one who can pull them up. They never say \"you're my last chance at love\" but it feels like that. I know that there are some guys that feel like that is true. And I don't honestly have any good advice on how to break that mindset, it's very scary, for me at least, to have this level of attention scrutiny and deference paid to me. It's suffocating and stressful when I just want to have fun with someone. \n\nAnother is everyone's absolute dependence on work. A lot of people have schedules that make dating near impossible. They have the will but no way to devote the time required to forge a relationship. This is complicated by both parties. \n\nThe best answer though is that everyone is struggling in dating. There are plenty of people of all sexes who throw in the towel on dating. The internet provides an easy replacement for socialization. The best and only advice is to be yourself publicly.",

            "text": "**All dating apps and web sites are a scam.**\n\nYes, even the \"wholesome\" ones like the religious-based ones or the ones that claim to be all on personality.\n\nThese apps and sites are businesses.  They make money by getting you to pay subscription fees.  They don't *want* you to be successful; they want you to keep looking and keeping paying them money.  Sadly, I did that for far too long.\n\nThere are all kinds of scams they pull.\n\nFirst, many (most?) of the biggest apps/sites are owned by the same company.  A bunch bought up each other until there's one main company that runs most of the big names.  They want you to think choosing one as the \"best\" is somehow winning over the others, but they don't care which one(s) you pick, because they're all the same.  If they can scam you into subscribing to more than one, then they get even more money.  Until there's a way to truly only pay them when you're successful, this will continue.\n\nAll the sites have limitations.  Each is a little different mix, but all of them leave out one or two key components that would let you really find a better match more easily.  It's not that they can't put those components in - they often do, on their other sites - they simply don't want to give you a good chance at finding a good match quickly.  Of course they'll usually hide some search options, usually messaging, and sometimes other functionality behind the paywall; but even then, they'll never really give you *all* the important tools to search and connect effectively.\n\nThe apps/sites are definitely, intentionally designed to do and emphasize what everyone has already noticed (but try to blame on society, or individuals, or one gender or another, or other factors): women, especially attractive ones, are inundated with lots of crappy offers (\"the odds are good, but the goods are odd\"); and most men, even the \"good\" ones, are largely ignored completely.  If you keep people from matching up, then you keep them paying you for another six months of \"service\".\n\nBefore you subscribe, most sites give you a lot of attractive matches.  After you sign up, they mysteriously dry up, and they don't give you many good matches, even from the criteria you set up.  This is intentional.  They know you'll remember the great matches you saw before, and they know most people will keep trying to find those sorts of good matches again - to no avail, so they'll keep paying.\n\nMany of the most attractive finds are fake - ghost accounts run by the company itself to attract subscribers.  Some won't reply at all; some will string you along (with responses written by the company employees) just enough so you'll think they're real, but then of course nothing ever comes of it.  Except you think you were so close to landing a great match, so you keep paying the money in hopes of finding another.  They feed it exactly like a gambling addiction.\n\nThey're also designed to emphasize building unrealistic expectations, which just leaves you unsuccessful and unhappy, but wanting more - so, again, you'll keep paying them money, hoping to find that unattainable success.\n\nThere are plenty of other tricks, too; those are just the ones I remember off the top of my head.\n\nThis is all coming from someone whose career is in the tech world - which is why I was so hopeful for dating apps when I started using them, and why I now understand how they really work and why it's all a huge scam.\n\nSo, bottom line, it's best for everyone to stop falling for the scam, stop using them entirely, and just go back to traditional dating.",

At least you'll start with visual and social cues to let you know if she's actually really interested.

I will point them out and try to explain my thoughts, they might be wrong though.\n\n1. Dating as a teenager and what i call a dating depression: Due to social media, movies or other forms of consumable content. Dating and sexual intercourse is more prominent in the lives of younger kids. It isn't uncommon that kids at the age of 12 are in a GF/BF relationship and i have seen some posts on this website, not sure how true they are, where there was claimed that kids in that year had sex. It's more normal to see that with kids at the age of 14-16. And while i think it is not wrong to explore your own like that. I think it's not a good idea. I think this way, because simply at that point, we are kids. We aren't mature enough to maintain a healthy Relationship. Usually one if not both often develops toxic traits for that relationship, which scars the other one. Envy, anxiety and potential world/heartbreak once they break up which can lead to depression and a negative view on relationships as a whole. \"Have fun in your teenage years while they last\", while you will only remember the day your world shattered. \n2. Having a job and living out your hobby is more important than having a Relationship: Now we all need to make our money. We all need to fulfill our desired by partaking in our hobbies. But for many, especially those that have to take a long time to get to their workplace and back home, it's not possible atm. Let's say you are 12 hours ot of your home because of your job (time for driving, break time etc. included), 8 hours of sleep (taking the average to be healthy), 2 hours for gym (1.5h session with 30 min drive time), and 2 hours left. If you decide to cook then thats 1 more hour gone. Now you have 1 hour in your day. For your hobby which usually makes you happy and lets you destress. Or for an SO that could stress you more if their day was also stressfull. Of course not everyone will sleep 8 hours, be out of home for their job for 12 hours or go to the gym at all. Im quite lucky with my current workplace and am only 9.5 hours away. But for some this scenario is the truth. They simply have no time for a relationship. \n3. Mental Illness: I don't want to sound rude, but in this time of age, especially since the pandemic. Most people aren't really in the right headspace to start a Relationship now. They should focus on themselves before trying things out with others. Many won't do that though. I also include every kind of past traumas that would damage a relationship here. So if your trust was once broken by a past partner and you can't connect to a new one yet, this will be concluded into this point. \n4.  Being in the twenties is still being young: A friend of mine (21) just came out of a, in perspective quite long, Relationship. Now they are basically drinking, partying and having fun every other weekend. He is on Tinder but he wouldn't care if he doesn't instantly find someone. For him i think he is just craving physical and emotional warmth currently. But i think that mind set is very dominant in a lot of people in that agegroup. \"I can set down with someone once im thirty, once im old\". Drink while your liver still stands. Et cetera. Might not be the best decision for their health but i don't think it's wrong to live like this. Also people in their 20's still have a lot to learn about life and about being mature, so it might be better to not be in a relationship. \n5. Quite obvious, some are still closetted: Since freindgroups, family or something else can hold them back. These people just tend to be single until they can come out to the world. And i wish them the best of luck and lots of love. \n6. The last one i can currently think of is having a major gap in their interests: Now this might seem a bit weird. But for example if i were into a girl only to find out she has a horse i would lose all interest in an instant. Though having a horse must mean she has spare money because holy cow these are expensive. But there are a few things you just can't deal with. And in some scenarios these things will be a potential deal breaker. So why try in the first place.  \n\n\nLike i said these are just my thoughts. They might be totatlly wrong but at least from my observation this isn't the case. Of course i could add looks. A good friend of mine isn't the best looking one but i know his heart is pure. I can't tell if he ever gets a partner for life due to how hard he got hit by his genes. But i wish him the best of luck. But thats about it i guess. In the end a Relationship is a commitment, do you have the money, the time, they emotional ressources to sustain one? If not, don't bother yet.",

Additionally, I feel most women, that are willing to date me, are only looking for a ‚Äúhandsome wallet‚Äù and tbh I don‚Äôt feel like investing so much into someone for whom I am just so disposable and replaceable. I don‚Äôt think all women are that superficial, but I have a hard time deciding, if someone is interested in me for the right reasons or just looks/money. I feel like my life can be just as fulfilling, if I focus on weightlifting and university, rather than pursuing women.",

The confidence, however, mostly came from not giving a shit about them and whether they liked me or not. I was fucking amazing, you see, and they were lucky to be around me for an hour or two. If they caused any drama I would just go be with someone else until they figured out how little they mattered. Which made them want to prove they were better than the other girls and come back even more willing to do whatever I wanted.\n\nI would never, ever allow myself to get down to just one girl I was dating. The power dynamic just didn't work it I couldn't ditch her for someone else the moment she tried to ask anything from me. That also allowed me to chat up some beautiful girl and not care if she was into it or not. I had six other girls that were calling me. Which is precisely why the beautiful girl was interested in me because I didn't give a shit about her.\n\nI am happily married now and glad I'm not dating. I look back on those times and think about how badly I treated people. A lot of them were playing their own games, yes. But it's still a really inhumane way to treat people. I'm glad I'm not like that now. It's hard to imagine being that person again.\n\nBut I also know the women that were attracted to the old me would not like the new me. They want the guy that is a shining star in his own universe. They want to feel like they are the special one that he's with right now when he could be with anyone. Or better: their egos won't accept that I would refuse them when I'm with so many others. If other beautiful girls want to be with me then I have to be with them or they aren't desirable.\n\nThey wouldn't even notice the me of now. Certainly not desire. And to a certain extent, not respect. I love my wife and take care of my family. I'm boring and I don't feed their egos. \n\nWoe is you who wish to date and bring honesty, kindness and good values.

I was lucky enough that all these 4 had some scratches from previous relationships. Most of them experienced abusive relations, and I am kinda gentle guy. I was taught to always treat women with highest respect and so do I. I respect their independence, and while I also have a lot of female friends (just friends), I would be hypocrite if I tried to control them by any means. Do you know if somebody is going through difficult times? Not every time. Sometimes girl looks like she is seriously interested. Later on it comes out she has some emotional issues right now, but hey, let's not talk about it, we're having fun and I'm really happy with you etc. etc. all these kind of bullshit.\n\nTwo of them cheated on me. Other two returned back to ex. So I was like a place to heal, sometimes to allow crying on my shoulder. Once finished, I was dumped.\n\nWhy? Probably because I'm nice, and in the same time I'm boring af. I have my strong interests and I love to spend time on my hobbies. That's why I love to listen about somebody's hobbies as well, and the girl I meet must have them. I am terrible partner in daily basis. I can't really gossip or talk about new movies or tv series.

Looking at this thread though even though there seems to be a lot of commiserating between people with similar problems (not to mention an unhealthy amount of misogyny), the other people just seem kind of mean. Mostly how if you are having these problems it must be your fault, or that you are a loser or something. This may be a cultural issue (I'm from the US) but male-male interaction even among friends always has this weird competitive vibe to it that doesn't feel healthy.

She definitely knew this person when we were together but I dont want to believe she had an affair. We were our first real 'loves', if she really meant it, and I will always have feelings for her, even in twenty years or so. I used this app because of my hesistance to go out and meet new people, I really do like to get to know people but I can hardly express interest in someone in real life. It's like my mind shuts off for a moment and gives me the desire to be alone. Via text, I can speak my mind and have a serious conversation with people.\n\nThe problem with online dating is that you choose some on general interesting things like looks, favorite activities etc, but you can never look past that and see what the person values in life. You find that out later, when you are already dating. Me and my former GF definitely were definitely not compatible in that matter, even though she knew from the beginning that I might not be the person she is looking for. But we kept on going, I tried to become a better person and be more what she values in people but, the process is too slow. Especially in this day and age of everything must be done instantly and you have to perform at 1000% every day of the week. Therefore, growing with someone is out of the question, even if you love them. The choice of 'oh i'll just find another one who fits me more' is too easily made in my opinion. Do you think our grandparents had the same feeling, of 'plenty of fish in the sea', where they had to try out every type of person to find the right one. They found someone whom they cared about and they stayed together, not because their personalities are perfectly aligned with eachother, but because they LOVE eachother. What happened to love perserveres all? Maybe I am too naive about that.\n\nThe feeling that stays behind is guilt. Pure guilt. Not being good enough for your partner, for your family and friends and definitely not for the next romantic interest in line. Therefore I am thinking about going out of the dating scene, not because I hate women or my former GF, but I think dating in the way it's done today damages you more than it gives. Did I have a damn good time the last two years? Yes. Do I feel like a complete sack of poop for the coming time? Also yes. Does that withhold me from doing anything productive romantically? Well, yes. Why should I give my time and energy for a person when dating is all about trying another 'fish in the sea', just for a while and eventually ditch for the next fish.",

It's a mechanism created to generate favorable conditions for overlooking the other's flaws to get the hormones flowing for about a year and a half, by which time she should be pregnant, and by the time they take an actual look at each other, there's a kid and societal pressure tying them together and probably marriage.\n\nRight now, the mechanism is pretty much: Good looking pics on dating app, message flirt, meet in real life a couple of times, go to each other's homes, sleepovers, sleepovers turning into a discussion on why paying rent on two places makes sense, turning into living together. That's much better than dating for getting to know a partner. It does however exclude men who can't do some of these things (good-looking pictures, flirting over messages, a home).",

            "text": "Why are young men giving up on dating?\r  \nAn Interesting indeed. We are witnessing a phenomenon of the 21th century in which parts of the male population refuse to date. \n\n\r  \n1. Men aren‚Äôt in the ‚Äûhigher value‚Äú position anymore\r  \nCompared to the 18th, 19th, 20th century where women ‚Äûneeded‚Äú a man in their life, times are different now. Back then a women was often required to have a man in their life plus would be severely shunned/outcast for having ‚Äûdated‚Äú a man without the idea of possibly marrying. In the 21th century we are seeing a ‚Äûnew‚Äú way of dating. \r  \nWhereas earlier a good family background, money and a job was required to seem eligible, attractiveness is now the most important good. Since women don‚Äôt require any of the aformentioned things to be present, because they mostly provide for themselves, they seek for the ‚Äûhigher‚Äú things in life ergo- Falling in love/ finding the ‚Äûperfect‚Äú partner. \n\n\r  \n2. The Loop of Attractiveness and the opportunity cost of low cost dating \r  \na) The loop of Attractiveness\r  \nWe see beatifull people online 24/7. No matter where we look, we compare ourselves. Our standards of what is beatifull ‚Äûinflates‚Äú in a certain way. There always was an idealized sence of ‚Äûbeauty‚Äú however, it was never fully defined. Through working out in the gym many people start looking alike, because muscles simply look a certain way. We now see people who kind of look ‚Äûalike‚Äú. A certain hight, a certain way of life, a certain look. Mostly happy. \r  \nNow- If we go back to the actual reality and start comparing ourselves and our partners, we‚Äôll see a problem. Humans tend to compare themselves to judge the value of their posessions. If we proprose that a Partner is also considerer a ‚Äûposession‚Äú we might find ourselves disappointed, if we then compare our \"good‚Äú the ‚Äûnormal‚Äú partner to the idealized world of instagram etc. \r  \nOur partners will never fit the ‚Äûidealized‚Äú version of what we see everyday, yet we still compare them because our ideal of beauty has inflated so much. \r  \nOn Dating sites we see this problem being made even more important. Since we don‚Äôt get the opportunity to present out personality, our attractiveness (which as established before, is very important anyway in current times) gets even more important in the dating world. \r  \nWomen who most (as established before) want to find love and through permanent media consumption assume that beauty equals happiness, will simply not ‚ÄûLike/Match‚Äú a male that doens‚Äôt find a high standard. \r  \nb) The opportunity cost of low cost Dating\r  \nMen will see themselves being disrespected and find only few matches, if they dont match a certain standard of beauty. The opportunity cost for males is: Their loss of self-insurance. In their mind, they are not attractive enough to fit the beauty standards of today and therefore can‚Äôt fullfill their primal need for reprocreation, resulting in light-depression. \r  \nWomen in comparison will see themselves embelished by lots of desperate men, trying to escape the loop. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nc) The hidden side of the coin, Online-Dating for Women and its drawbacks \r  \nLets say that women mostly match the males who fit the beauty standards that they deem proper. Since that beauty standard has mostly been set by social media, many other females will tend to agree and therefore ‚Äûmatch/like‚Äú that person. This results in 90% of women liking/Matching 10% of men. These men will mostly not be attentive of the women who date them, because they simply have so many matches. In a twist of fate, many women therefore have an experience that is as bad, as the experience of the males who don‚Äôt manage to fit a certain standard of beauty. \n\n\r  \n3. The Results and an outlook for actual living\r  \n It seems that the only people who win at this shallow game, are the guys who adjusted themselves to fit a proposed standard of beauty. We learn from this, that we as males can either\r  \na) Adjust ourselves aswell\r  \nb) Quit a game that we cannot win\r  \nc) Keep trying without changing ourselves\n\n\r  \n4. My Own Thoughts\r  \nIn the current times it is all about improving ourselves, ‚Äûloving ourselves‚Äú to such a degree that it sometimes feels alienating to see what many people describe as ‚Äûtoxic‚Äú. I believe that we can take ‚Äûsome‚Äú pointers from online dating. \r  \nMainly, how to approach women and that ‚Äûimproving‚Äú ourselves sometimes can be very effective. I believe that males have the opportunity to get more fit and get their shit together. Online-Dating is like  a reality check, in which you see  a diminished reaction to yourself compared to real life. You always, always, always have to realize that the perspective of Online Dating is skewed. IRL many things which can‚Äôt be defined by social media will come into effect (smell, voice etc. etc.) If we change ourselves ‚Äûjust a little bit‚Äú (like proposed in 3 a) and combine that with seeking out Women in Clubs and in Real life, we can be way more succesfull. \r  \nSo: I believe quiting while also adjusting ourselves and going back to real life dating is the best option we could do. Instagram will still fuck with the standards of beauty in real life but it won‚Äôt be as extreme, as it is on Dating sites (as established before). \r  \nTo all the guys out there: Don‚Äôt get stuck in your own self pity, there is simply no need for it. But also don‚Äôt be to stubborn to refuse change. The way of dating has changed and just like in the animal world, we have to adjust to the new standards set- allbeit in slow steps. \r  \n\r  \nThanks for reading, keep your head up.",

She can sit back and relax, you are a man and you have to handle everything.\n- she decide to leave you? You are forced to pay if her way of life change for the worse.\n- she is the only one that decide if you will have a kid or not and if she breaks up with you after having one - you are forced to pay.\n- if she cheats on you and have a baby with other guy, you are forced to pay. You might have proof that kid is not yours, you are forced to pay if she does not point the real father.\n- she quits her job? Nobody will say anything to her. You quit yours? Everyone will point fingers at you.\n- she is abusive? There is no help for you and not a single shelter. Most people will laugh at you.\n- they are trying to pass a law like in other European city where if wife call police on you, she does not need any evidence of abuse or anything - police will remove you from your own home. So she can do that and live with lover. You are forced to pay for home and possible kids.\n\nIn reality there is NOTHING for you when you get married. You get bunch of responsabilities, none of the benefits and there is countless ways she can screw you over. You are just a fucking walking wallet with current laws.\n\nSure you have a chance of getting a real partner but it's kinda like a stranger who ask for your life savings to invest them. Since 50% of marriages ends with divorce (and during pandemic it was above 50%), that stranger have 50% chance of either really investing or running away with your life savings.\n\nWould you give stranger all you have if there is no protection for you, no help and there is 50% chance they will take what you got and leave?\n\nObviously not.

An average looking woman on a dating app will get tens to hundreds of matches on a regular basis from guys just wanting to hook up with them. Unfortunately this means that guys who would normally be above their social standing will contact them trying to get an easy lay, and that makes these women think that they can lock down one of these higher standing guys for a relationship, but he‚Äôs not interested so it perverts the dating market. \nThe best thing you can do is a young guy is get rid of all the dating apps, work on doing things that make you happy, whether that be hobbies or sports or being successful at business, and if you see someone you like in real life, strike up a conversation. If it doesn‚Äôt go anywhere and you‚Äôre not getting any interest from the other side, then just take the hint and move on. Just remember, as a young guy, you still have plenty of time to get a relationship in the future, and the thing that makes you more desirable to most women, is the more assets and success you have. You need to be careful that someone isn‚Äôt just after you for your assets or wealth, but women are always looking to date higher on the social scale, so unless you‚Äôre extremely good looking, you need to work on yourself first and build up your desirability while having fun and enjoying your life. Don‚Äôt let it get you down, just keep moving forward and concentrate on the great things you have in your life, and not the things you don‚Äôt. üòä",

I have better luck looking for hookups than I do dating. I'm not saying I'm a Casanova either, just my experience. I prefer to stay single because it's simply more fun.

The whole process could take days, weeks or even months just to get to the first date.  That doesn't happen anymore.\n\nThe core principles are still the same, because girls have what guys want and not the other way around, which means girls can afford to pick and choose.  Only nowadays, instead of competing against every other guy in the room (nightclub, dance, party, fast food joint, etc.), each guy has to compete against every guy in the world with an online profile.

Let me add that both were irreplaceable experiences that taught me important lessons not just about dating, but also what I wanted from a relationship.\n\nMy first girlfriend: We realized that after the honeymoon/infatuation phase wore off, we were completely different people with different life paths. The only thing that kept us together was the idea of a relationship, and not asking if we were compatible or not. We decided it wasn't worth it.\n\nMy second girlfriend: In the moment everything felt great, but where was it headed? Engagement? Marriage? A family? Of course not. I had nothing to offer long-term, if I did maybe I could've made it work but she deserves someone who could take it to the next level and commit.\n\nI got into those relationships because solely because I actively sought to be in a relationship, but in all honesty it only brought some heartache and what felt like wasted time and effort that could've been productively used elsewhere.\n\nI refused to look for another relationship since because I don't believe I'm ready for one, I'm afraid of the uncertainty it could bring, and that it seems like an optional choice in my life path right now. I'm already busy juggling a balance with work, studying, and downtime, and trying to fit a relationship into that balance is daunting. I don't see myself having a truly open schedule for commiting to that sort of thing anytime in the next five years. That's how it seems to be, for me at least.\n\nI will say the one thing I miss from being in a relationship are the cuddling and pillowtalks.

If I was not a man, I'm sure that it would make sense to me to be hyper critical of the ideas and traditions around 'men', especially looking at the history of how badly women have been treated, as well as how badly women still are treated in many places around the world. That doesn't meant that this is a good way to approach the situation, but I think it does make sense. What's my solution?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTry to learn how to be a better man.

We are now one year together and things are great!\n\nBUT, it had to swipe through thousand of people, had decent success (5 matches a month in average with sometimes 10 a week and sometimes zero a month). Tried contacting most of them with a opener around her pictures or profile and a lot of time only hot short answers all around or none at all. But sometimes I had some really good conversations going, went onto some dates, started dating some for longer, but Ultimately realized that she was not the one fot me or the other way around. It took me around 1 1/2 years of non stop writing with strangers, asking the same questions (and answering) to get to know them, which quite honestly burnt me up a whole damn lot in the process.\nBut then I matched with my current girlfriend and we hit it off. Even after a year we do a lot of things, that would annoy other people but we think of as adorable when the other does it. We don't have to change our behavior and I think that this is why we work.\nIt was also just dumb luck that we found each other because I almost didn't contact her because we matched on one of those rare 10 matches a day days and she simple slipped through without me really realizing that we matched.\n\nWhat I want to say is, dating is goddammit hard! It is really difficult to find someone that you think is attractive (let's be real, visual attraction is also important), likes your personality and can live with your quirks. All those points must be mutual, which makes things a lot more difficult. \nBut, sometimes you find that someone and that's absolutely great. Most people simply are not that person for you, but that can only be found out through try and error.\n\nIf you really want a partner you just have to put that work in, which is a lot but can pay off when you find that someone. Hang in there guys, I know we get the feeling that we are not good enough, but trust me, If I can find someone, you can too.

I‚Äôve tried love a few times. It was great, possibly one of the best feelings, but it seldom lasts. People quit quickly on relationships and it seems it‚Äôs most of an investment like a stock portfolio rather than love and connection and through poor and sickness. You can swipe your finger and see 10000s of options of a possibly greener pasture...problem is, I think even women feel this way, we live in the era of me me me. My perfect body. My bank account. My follower count. My clout. Seems like no one is really ready to ride or die for one another, everyone is hedging their bets on themselves. I was listening to a Jordan Peterson podcast with Chris Williamson (it was just uploaded) and they talk about the current dating scene: how a small small small amount of men have all the weather, power, fame, etc-and they get ALL the pickings so they don‚Äôt want to settle down, and the women want THOSE men, yet they can‚Äôt get them bc they don‚Äôt want to settle down, and the bottom half of men the women don‚Äôt want, yet women are getting into their lates 20s and 30s and want kids yet there is no one to have kids with....you should check the podcast out, it‚Äôs interesting...quite frankly, I‚Äôm tired if hierarchies, I‚Äôm tired of having to be x y z just to maintain a mate, id rather just be me and be content alone instead of living in fear that I‚Äôm not perfect enough to keep a lover around. It‚Äôs exhausting, and ultimately leads me to feeling resentful bc I feel partner x or y is only here bc of some economic metrics....thus is being human, only natural...thus, I‚Äôm not sure I believe in love anymore honestly...just a primordial chess game..",

Only people keep these generic ideas of traditional marriages are conservatives, its only reason why dating works for them and the middle east. Thus our liberal society creates a lot of single people, and women not wanting to date them, its basically china with their left over \"men\". And india will enter this phase as they develop thus creating even more..  You can see why they want a indoctrinated society.  A free society is better, more freedom everyone.   I'm extremely observant of relationships and human behavior especially around my community and lot of my highschool friends and family and everywhere else, not too hard to notice. \n\nAnd here I am in my 40s, dating is quite easy where im at, tend to attract the crazy ones, I mean literally and some normal ones. But you know I gave up after some years cause lately I entered a very \"lone\" lazy wolf phase, where im extremely tired and not wanting to do anything with my life, only my job, no way in heck I'd survive a relationship with me just wanting to sleep/eat/work.  Dating itself is tiring, costs a lot of time and money.. And dating single parents can be a nightmare men/women, glad I don't have kids, I hate em; I've noticed at least 70% of them tend to be crazy/desperate due to their kids and which makes me feel bad for their kids.\n\nConsidering I own some sex dolls which keeps me happy, releases that steam. Comforting and provides that nice sleepy teddy bear spooning, wish I had one of these when I was 13.. instead of me screwing around with neighbor kids, glad nothing happen(would of been very early parent, thanks to shooting blanks everywhere).

Dating has changed \"DRAMATICALLY\" between my teens - 20's - and now my 30's. From simple texts and phonecalls to social media and tinder it's been a crazy couple of decades for dating.\n\nI can totally see why young guys are \"giving up\" on dating today. In the last couple of years I started to notice a trend where it almost seems like I'm either being interrogated or interviewed for a job and my date is working through a list of their requirements. One of the biggest turn offs is them trying to figure out how much I'm earning. I can smell that crap from a mile now, and it's funny when they try to be sneaky about it. I guess that's to do with my age now as someone in their early 20's probably wouldn't be valued for their money (unless rich daddy).\n\nI know how it feels to have a true connection with someone. When you just click with someone and you feel like you two truly understand each other and value each other for who you are. There's a great deal of respect, affection and chemistry. Spending time with that person is something that is a reward in itself. But I've not had that connection with anyone in at least 5-6 years now. Maybe I'm partially to blame for that too, but I can't respect someone who is poorly educated, has an attitude like you're nothing but a checklist candidate, and acts extra nice only when she needs something. That's a majority of my dates in the last few years.\n\nBut I don't stress over it. I'm not bitter or anything. I just accept it as my own experience and focus instead on things that can improve my life. But I will always think life is better when you have someone that gets you and loves you.

So if I'm being honest the reason I've given up is solely because the only time I've ever been in a relationship was because I knew the person in real life and met them before dating and it was an organic thing where we both were drawn to each other, not some fucking dice roll on our phones.",

            "text": "This'll probably be buried cause this thread already has nearly 5k comments but here goes:\n\nIn HS I could never get a date.  I never tried that hard for it though.\n\nCollege came around and I thought that was when everyone finds a partner, or at least dates a bit, so I tried.  For 5 years.  Had plenty of lady friends, but none who wanted to take it further.\n\nGraduated college still dateless, got pretty depressed about it towards the end of my time there.  \n\nAs a working adult, who doesn't drink and so doesn't like bars, I figured my best bet was online dating.  I dabbled in tinder, bumble, PoF, but my main site was OkC.  Over the course of a few years I must have sent hundreds of messages, all typed individually and personally based on the profile.  I never sent \"hey\" or \"wanna fuck\" messages cause nearly every profile I saw said they wouldn't respond to that.\n\nAfter several years of this, I finally got a date that led to something more.  We dated for like 2 weeks.  It wasn't a great personality match.  I finally had sex though for the first time at 28, and it was... meh.\n\nNow, I'd be lying if I didn't say that having sex was a major motivator at the time.  It was this core experience, not even a core human experience, but a core experience to every animal on the planet.  I wanted the companionship, but I wanted sex too.  \n\nI'll also say that I was unable to finish the second time we did it.  This was likely because by that point, I masturbated daily, sometimes as much as 5 times a day, but I'd say the average hovered around 1-3 times a day.\n\nWell, with the personality match not being great, we broke up.  After that, I decided fuck it.  I'm already a person that does well on their own.  Without the desire to experience sex driving me, I had very little drive to keep subjecting myself to online dating.  I also found out after the fact that probably most of the women I sent messages to never even saw my thoughtfully crafted messages, as Match, the company that bought out OkC, had changed the way messaging worked so they only saw it if they liked your profile.  I thought I could break through my sub-par appearance on personality, but I never had a chance.  Even a \"proper\" dating site like OkC would boil down your entire being to some pictures and a few sentences that could easily be skipped over in favor of a better looking profile pic.\n\nThe years of online dating not paying off for the amount of effort I was putting in was crushing to my self esteem.  I was just as depressed as when I was dateless (I still was dateless for the most part, except for that one person, and 2 others I had gotten a first date with over a 5+ year period)\n\nAdd to that my job had moved to a place I didn't want to settle.  They were giving me a nice move bonus that I'd use to buy an expensive tool I wanted for years, but I had no plans to stay in my new locale.  So I decided, while I'm here, I won't make any effort to find a partner.  No online dating at all.  If something happens, great, if not, doesn't matter.\n\nWell, all that happened about a year before covid hit, and my move contract stipulated that I work for them for 18 months minimum, so I was stuck in my new location.  Fortunately, it didn't matter.  Giving up on dating had been the right choice.  My mental health got better.  I started focusing on my hobbies and being thankful for the benefits of singledom.  My apartment is fully dedicated to my hobbies, something that probably wouldn't fly if I had a partner.\n\nI'm currently getting ready to jump into the job search and start looking for something closer to where I want to settle.  Once I get there, I have no plans to resume online dating.  Again, if something happens, great.  But based on previous experiences with not trying, I doubt anything will happen. For now, my physical needs are met, I'm just lacking the companionship.  I think once I'm settled in a new place, I'll get a cat or dog.\n\nSome people just aren't cut out for having a human partner.  I know I'm not hideous, but I'm out of shape and not particularly handsome either.  I don't drink.  I'm introverted with new people.  I have hobbies that are either solitary or male-centric in demographics.  My friends are all so old that getting set up with someone is unlikely, as most of their friends are now in long term relationships and getting married.\n\nThe toll on my mental health isn't worth the *chance* at finding a decent partner.  I have friends and family for companionship.  I can get a pet too.  I'd rather try and find other ways of being happy than subject myself to that mental hellscape again.  Online dating was lauded as the place to go for guys like me to find a partner.  Where I could meet a weirdo like me who also had trouble dating, and we'd be each other's perfect match.  It ended up being a place where the same people trolling the bars for one night stands could get more eyes on them.  The big fish were just as big in this new pond, and a little fish like me never stood a chance any better than I did in the ocean.\n\nI'm pretty happy with my choice, and the results of it.  Its a quiet, simple life.  I have a lot of free time and disposable income to throw at my hobbies.  I hangout with distant friends online (and hopefully soon, in person).  Sometimes I'm lonely, but for the most part, I'm content with my life.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the wall.  If someone in a similar situation to how I started sees this, I hope it helps you work out your life.  You don't need a partner to be happy, and looking for one may be doing more harm than good.",

Ask them if they can set you up with one of their friends. That way you don‚Äôt have to do much effort at all.\n - Get your mental health sorted and learn how to cultivate positive traits that are good for you and make people like you (and if you have negative traits or anxieties, work on fixing them - friends are great to talk to, but a qualified therapist is amazing if you can afford one).\n - Build networks of supportive, kind friends. Cut unsupportive people out of your life. I cannot stress these two things enough.\n - Learn how to become a kind, supportive friend. The kind of person who people like to talk to and who they always like having around.\n\n#2. Reduce time wasted on social media.\n\n - I deleted my Instagram and all my other social media apps (except Reddit, obviously).\n - I use a couple of messaging services to stay in touch with people.\n - I still have Facebook but I deleted the app from my phone and don‚Äôt watch stories. I hardly ever use it now, maybe once a week to find out local events and organise going to them with my friends (this is important, as it gives you an opportunity to meet people, who you can either attempt to woo or they can then introduce you to their single friends).\n\n#3. Only join dating apps that don‚Äôt waste your time and learn to use them efficiently.\n\n - Don‚Äôt put too much time into crafting long messages for each match (although don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúhi‚Äù, you need to give them something to go on, such as asking an open question). Instead rely on having good photos and a funny bio.\n - Don‚Äôt spend hours on them and don‚Äôt put effort into trying to carry a conversation with people who are not putting in an equal effort.\n - Unmatch/remove as many unresponsive people as possible. Don‚Äôt waste your time.\n - When you do get someone putting in equal effort, transition to text/WhatsApp as soon as possible. After a few texts/WhatsApp messages, arrange a date. Nobody who escalates to texting wants to be stuck there forever, they just want to feel safe/comfortable enough to go on a date with a stranger first.\n - Reduce your range to within your local city. That way you are far more likely to match with people who know your expanding friend group and will go to them and say ‚ÄúI matched with this guy, is he nice?‚Äù and your friends will say ‚Äúyes, he‚Äôs lovely. You should date him.‚Äù\n\n#4. Use your social circle to expand your options.\n\n - I‚Äôve mentioned this a couple of times already but asking friends or acquaintances to set you up with their friends pr acquaintances is a great way to get dates with minimal effort.\n - It also means you‚Äôre expanding your friend circle so that‚Äôs a win regardless.\n - It takes a lot of anxiety out of it for both of you, as you don‚Äôt have to worry about unnecessarily humiliating rejections  (see section 1. about getting supportive, kind friends) and she doesn‚Äôt have to worry about you being some stranger danger psycho because her friends already deem you safe enough to recommend as a potential partner for her.\n\n#5. Keep first dates to a brief coffee \n\n - If either if you doesn‚Äôt like the other, then you have only lost 20 minutes or so of your time.\n - Be polite and honest with your dates, even if you don‚Äôt like them.\n - If you both like each other, arrange a second date or just go somewhere else after the coffee.\n - ‚ÄúSo, how do you know my friend who set this up?‚Äù is a great conversation starter.\n\nEven if you don‚Äôt find a girlfriend straight away, you will end up physically fitter, with better mental health, with more money in your pocket, and with lots of supportive friends. It‚Äôs a win-win. Eventually it‚Äôs bound to work out because your options amongst people you actually know will expand significantly. People generally don‚Äôt want to date people they only know through social media. Building a real-life circle of friends is always better. Social media should just be a tool to help you do this and to stay in touch with people who you know appreciate your company and will help you when you need it.",

You're the one who decided to follow them for only one purpose. If you followed them because you were genuinely interested in doing so, it wouldn't be a waste of time. It's only a waste of time because of the specific reason you decided to do what you did.

The dates I went on didn't go well, and I got the feeling that being honest about myself wasn't a very reciprocal trait in this culture.\n\nI have since adopted a cat and started bettering myself.  I've worked on my career and hobbies, found the joy of just being nice and restricting algorithm based social media. \n\nTl,Dr; yeah, dating sucks. I'm hoping society moves to socialist communities or else just implodes.  Either works for me",

Social Media makes people feel superior in their digital fantasies and judge others for not living up to their digital status and their behaviour is almost diva like.\n\nA personal experience I‚Äôve had with this was when I was with my ex and she pulled me a side because she was concerned about something within our relationship. And with a worried voice she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not posting enough on your social media, you should be posting more.‚Äù And I‚Äôd never been more confused in my life and was getting annoyed trying to understand why something like this would even be an issue. The way she said this made it sound like my lack of activity online was a dealbreaker for the relationship.\n\nSo my point is I‚Äôve seen way to many people like this to the point I‚Äôve just given up. I‚Äôm from the midlands in England and most people here from my generation (I‚Äôm 28) have such a warped sense of reality.

It takes time and effort and there's a high probability it just won't work out and that's just plain hard. However, eventually when you're with the person that you love, it really is great and dare I say, worth the terrible aspects of getting to that point. I'm hearing alot of \"giving up\" or \"taking a break\" and definitely, absolutely step away from dating if it's not feeling right. Do whatever you need to do to work on yourself to work on things you enjoy and absolutely step away from instagram likes and focus on your hobbies instead! A big part of being healthy in a relationship is being healthy with yourself.  \n\nI think a huge part of dating that is never discussed is timing. If you're in a certain place in your life, with wants and needs, those things need to match to some extent with your partner-it's not just a physical attraction or interesting personality (although those are always bonuses). It's also hard to be told to be patient, but the timing piece really needs to align.  \n\nI guess I'd like to offer some hope-I'm a woman who is happily married to an amazing husband (together almost ten years now). I gave up a few times before I found him, and I know he did too. We actually found eachother using a dating app (OKC because I was a grad student at the time and it was the only free one). So many obnoxious married friends or friends in relationships would brag and say \"I wish I could get on those apps\" when I was on them and I legitimately wanted to slap them, because it's not something I would wish on others. It's pretty much the main way of dating these day though, and while tough, it ultimately can lead to something really great.",

Girls started getting interested when I was 13-14, so I had 2-3 formative years of fully suppressing the idea of dating. By the time I was 16, the girls I was interested in had moved on. For the rest of high school, most of my friends were girls and dating friends just didn't make sense.\n\nIn college I dated once or twice. Missed some opportunities due to naivety, I think. Had some bad experiences. And was just busy. I wasn't there to date. I was there to get the degree and secure job prospects.\n\nSecured the job prospects - got a job at a startup straight out of college. 60 hour weeks were common. Not really any time to date. Eventually did manage to step back a bit and did some online dating. I don't have any horror stories like others, but I went on 5 or so dates over a few months (a lot for me) and just didn't feel like it was going anywhere. Eventually moved out of the big city, which limited dating prospects further.\n\nIt was still hard to find the time too. It became either take care of myself, keep pouring work into finding a date, or lose my sanity. I've generally chosen \"take care of myself\", with middling results. I'm not unhappy - I'm financially secure, I have a house, etc. - but physical fitness is lagging and I understand that weighs heavily in the dating game.\n\nI also fully admit I have a bad habit of getting crushes on specific girls for unhealthy amounts of time and not acting on it. Either they're friends or coworkers, or they've moved, or I make up some other excuse to not do anything at the time but keep thinking about them and it sorta blocks out the desire to do anything else on the dating front.\n\nNow, I'm toying with the idea of getting back into online dating. Work has kind of calmed down even more (although it's still easy to get sucked into long hours).\n\nI do want a partner. The thought of going into old age alone is one of the few things that truly scares me. But it's still hard to find the time. Work + mental recuperation time + having a house to improve / maintain. It's all a drag. The thought of adding even a few hours a week to plan dates, go on dates, text enough to maintain a relationship (I hate texting). It's daunting.",

This is in no way meant to be narcissistic, but I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2, make over 6 figures, 26 years old, fit (I‚Äôve done a couple of steroid cycles back in the day and I‚Äôm probably in better shape than most guys my age), confident, but still - it feels like I‚Äôm always being interviewed throughout each encounter and it‚Äôs exhausting. I try to put effort into getting a relationship, but for some reason always get ghosted. For example, I‚Äôve been dating this girl who is a couple of years older than myself for about 4 weeks - I take flowers to her before V day and she invites me over for Valentine‚Äôs Day to hers to cook, watch a movie, and hook up. I spend the night with her and then I‚Äôm GHOSTED... Out of nowhere. Not a single text over the past week and I‚Äôve hit her up twice. So I‚Äôm chucking this one up as an L and moving on. \n\nI think part of the issue is with social media - there will ALWAYS be someone better looking, more charming, has better hair, makes more money, etc. than you and myself. Especially since women are chased much more by men than vice-versa, they feel like they always have tons of options - which in all fairness they do. So they focus on their careers and sleep/date around (pretty sure the girl I was just seeing was sleeping around with more dudes than just myself), and it‚Äôs always a competition among men to ‚Äúbeat out‚Äù the other guys. Plus, the amount of guys sliding into their DMs and hitting them up on dating apps is far greater than men get. \n\nAgain, I don‚Äôt think this is any fault on a woman‚Äôs end, she is just weighing her options and not doing anything wrong. But when options are so accessible, it makes settling ‚Äúharder‚Äù because there‚Äôs always going to be something else intriguing them. \n\nI‚Äôm not going to ‚Äúremove myself from society‚Äù, but as men, we just need to focus on ourselves. Get in better shape, read a book a month, meditate, pursue our careers and grow individually. I‚Äôm not going to lie and say I‚Äôm not lonely - because I am - but I‚Äôm going to continue pursuing my career and goals over all else. I still believe that I‚Äôll find the right one who will compliment me and not just take my energy to just hop right on over to another guy. \n\nJust keep focusing on yourself, man.

Have you seen sex toys today? Why would anyone leave their house? It‚Äôs a changing, sexless world. People are becoming more socially independent through the use of social media (yes, instant and constant communication with another person killed irl socializing. Similarly to how porn killed many peoples sex lives). I honestly don‚Äôt know if I CAN love someone at this point at this level of indulgence in the online space. The majority of men living their lives like this has most likely turned woman cold and abrasive towards dating and have resolved to garnering attention on social media to satisfy their NEED for love and validation. \n\nMy advice if you want to be successful dating and improve your happiness tenfold - abandon social media, porn, and other online hobbies like gaming. Make room in your life for someone if that‚Äôs what you truly desire. Stick with it, don‚Äôt go back or you‚Äôll fall into the same diminishing and empty routines that make you miserable. You will run into a few bad eggs while dating. Leave early if you have to. You have just as many choices in a partner as they do. Do not give them all the power immediately, respect yourself and woman will notice. \n\nIt‚Äôs the only way out.",

You mentioned spending too much time talking to girls who only want to interact on Instagram but wouldn't answer a phone call or meet up. Social media optimizes for these kinds of people. The women you're looking for probably aren't big social media users.\n\nI've got a couple of rules for myself that seem to work. First, I have a three chances rule. If I make three moves that aren't reciprocated, I stop wasting my time with the person. Whether that's three DMs that get no response, three invites to a date, or three displays of physical affection (Side note, with physical affection especially, you should be aware of her boundaries). If you stick to this rule, it's a good filter for people who are not interested or are going to waste your time while offering nothing in return. \n\nFor more than 10 years I've lived a digital nomad lifestyle, so I meet a lot of women in real life who are travel bloggers and Instagram influencers. I'm real life friends with a few of them, but I don't follow them on social media. They treat social media as a job. It's not how they make personal connections. And the reason they succeed at it as a job is because they're attractive enough to get tens of thousands of guys following them just by looking pretty on the camera. It's a terrible business model, to be honest. I think as a society we should try to eliminate incentives for this kind of \"light sex work\". It has negative effects on the mental health of the women who do it, and negative effects on the mental health of the men who follow them. It produces very little of real value.\n\n(Edit: I think a lot of people feel frustration with the way these things work these days. I think it's important to direct that frustration toward the system, and not the individuals caught up in it. I don't think the women doing this kind of work are doing anything morally wrong, nor do I think they're bad people. They're doing the best they can with the resources they have, as we all are. If there were better ways of doing things, I think all parties would be interested.)\n\nEvery once in awhile, I get caught up in it and I have to do what you did and unfollow all of the influencers, and stop wasting my time chatting with people who aren't reciprocating. I think you're on the right track with that. Just don't give up on pursuing the relationships and connections you want, refocus your energy on people who will reciprocate.\n\nBest of luck!",

            "text": "That feeling when you see this thread, instantly want to contribute because you feel it relates to you, and then you realize you're 36 years old and stopped being a 'young man' years ago...    \n\nIn my mind, I still am, though. I've had period in which I took a break from all (online) dating as well, sometimes for months on end. I would delete all dating apps and sometimes even trash my accounts completely. I hated online dating, and still do. For me, as a decidedly below-average looking man, it consisted of nothing but swiping right on profiles or sending messages to women who I knew would never give me the time of day. It was like a daily reminder of what I couldn't have and would never have: attractive women, one more beautiful and sexy than the previous one, which would make me feel incredibly frustrated. But even the 'average'/'plain' women would not match with me or react to my messages. They, too, could afford to be hyper-selective.   \n\nSooner or later, I would come back to the apps and dating sites, though, since the pandemic didn't allow for much other venues of 'meeting' women. But to be honest, even before, I didn't do well in real life either. I'm not the type to go to a bar and pick up a woman. I've tried approaching women there, still, as I did in all other venues. Making conversations, gauging if they were interested, building rapport, then asking them for a date or to 'hang out'. Theaters, stores, trains, cafes, work (Reddit says \"don't shit where you eat\", but a lot of people do it succesfully), you name it. Even did a few speed dating events. Nothing worked. So back to the old dating apps and sites it is.   \n\nI'm constantly going back and forth between wanting to give up and persisting. The thing is: going on the apps every day (Tinder, Bumble, OkCupid, and I used a few others in the past, including paid ones) garners no results except frustration and a damaged feeling of self-worth. The only way I ever get a match is when I swipe right on *everybody* indiscriminately, including the most hideous persons and obvious catfishers, and even then I barely get one a month. On the other hand, completely giving up feels like defeat and admitting that I failed as a normal human being. Which arguably I have, being perpetually single at this late age. But admitting it to myself would mean slashing my wrists, and I don't say that lightly; I'm dead serious.   \n\nAs for other social media, I don't give up following some women that I find attractive on Instagram and Facebook (yes, I'm old, I'm still on there), mostly celebrities. Because why not? It's not like I ever had a chance with them anyway, so there's no frustration there; it was not a dating app to begin with, so it's not like I'm getting rejected by them. Though some days, the particularly bad days, I keep the Instagram app closed. Some days I'm just too down to be looking at gorgeous girls I know I won't be getting anyway. But those are the days I'm not on the dating apps either. Generally though, I'm fine with looking at and appreciating beautiful women on social media, or on Reddit, for that matter.    \n\nI don't think your conclusion is right. I don't think \"most men\" have given up on dating. A lot of men in this particular subreddit may have, but I don't think that's representative of the male population as a whole at all. Though there is a documented trend in young people, especially young men, having progressively less sexual interactions each year, according to surveys. The number of young men reporting not having sex at all in the last year is growing every year. Make of that what you will.",

It all boils down to being severely depressed from about the age of 12 to nearly 30.

I work at a grocery store and there has never been any prospects available because it‚Äôs typically either teenage girls or women much older than me who work here. In my time only a tiny number have been in my age range. However, they have always been either married, not interested in dating, had older kids or were recently divorced.\n\nI am just now where I am even a bit financially decent off and want to date but I have zero luck in finding any women in my area who are single and want to date within my preferred age range. Most women my age here are married and if they aren‚Äôt they are druggies or have kids or are divorced. I am not entirely against dating a divorc√©e or a woman with kids but that isn‚Äôt a place I want to start out with, being so inexperienced.

I was also educated in very sheltered, tiny private schools so I was never exposed to conflict or anyone unlike me. My social skills, due to this insular environment and my own reclusiveness, disintegrated slowly, and by the time my family moved to a new state and I had to switch to a big public school, I had nothing left.\n\nSlowly, I became more aware of how different I was, and more embarrassed of myself; I was also pretty heavy then, and being in such an affluent school where it seemed everyone was fitter, more popular, and richer than me was tough at that age. I developed some extreme social anxiety and depression. Looking back, I had self-harmed as early as Kindergarten, but this brought it all back and worse.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a long journey back and I‚Äôve had to force myself out of my comfort zone quite a bit to grow, but I‚Äôve gotten to a place where I have friends that I trust and I don‚Äôt stutter through interactions anymore. I take care of myself physically and I know I look and feel better. \n\nThat said, growth is a constant process, and feeling ready to have conversations and make friends is *not* the same as feeling ready to be loved. I worry that I‚Äôll never be enough for anyone, inside or out. I know this is just insecurity, but I will not bring that kind of insecurity into a relationship. When I feel that I‚Äôve resolved my flaws, I‚Äôll be ready to put myself out there again.\n\nLove is messy, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a possibility; obviously I am *not* the only person out there looking for genuine connection.

I‚Äôm 32 now, and have way more options because I can date as young as 23-24, whereas when I was 23, my only real options were 22-23 year olds, who had graduated college. I wouldn‚Äôt wait too long after 30 to get serious though because if you age yourself out of the 24-30 y/o women, you‚Äôll start to see more women who have kids approach you.\n\nAlso, men generally level up over time (can go opposite for women), well into your 30s. You won‚Äôt peak until your 30s, even if you go bald, as long as you stay in shape, and keep working on yourself and your career. I‚Äôm 32 now, and if my 25 y/o girlfriend has to choose between my 25 y/o self, and my 32 y/o self, she‚Äôd choose the 32 y/o me every day of the week. This is because I have more confidence which is really attractive to women, and I have almost 4x the income I had when I was 25. After my high school sweetheart, I didn‚Äôt have one girlfriend during my 20s, until I was 30, and not for a lack of trying. Since then I‚Äôm on my third girlfriend.\n\nBe patient my friend. My other 32y/o friends who found the love of their life and married early now have mortgages, kids to take of, and overweight 32y/o wives. I on the other hand have very little responsibilities, have saved up a ton of money, and a thin 25y/o girlfriend. Sometimes it can benefit you to level up first and lock down your girlfriend/wife during your peak years in your early 30s, rather than trying to get whatever you can when you‚Äôre 23. Just stay in shape.",

Women are people just like men. They get lonely, they have goals, they want companionship and affection. So if you‚Äôre viewing it as a game, a program with input and output, a chore to be done because you‚Äôre told to, or refuse to emotionally engage, you‚Äôre doomed before you start. We have the opportunity for a paradigm shift in terms of what dating and relationships look like in a way that better serves both men and women. Women are more independent than ever which empowers them and takes some of the pressure off of us. \n\nTry taking some time for introspection, ask what you want for yourself what you want and why, and then work toward achieving that so you find meaning in your life outside a relationship, and better yourself for yourself, not to impress women. Get that new car because you live driving in comfort. Dress nice so you feel good. Make money to do things you like to do and be comfortable at home. Then rather than making so much effort for seemingly no reward, you gain something for yourself and all you have to do at that point you don‚Äôt have to be searching, but just keep yourself open to forming a connection with someone else with respect and on equal footing. Talk to people around you, show genuine interest when it‚Äôs there, and you‚Äôll find someone organically. \n\nNot everyone wants to be in a relationship, and thats perfectly fine. But if you do. You can, so don‚Äôt get discouraged. Don‚Äôt give up.",

Don't get me wrong I won't stop using it but it is changing our own outlooks on life. \n\nFOMO is a bit driver for the want of the things we can't have or don't have. Travel, sex, attention from people we want, stuff, etc.. I think our society hasn't caught up with the changes and we were raised in the old way of thinking - \"we can do anything\". But just like Hollywood and those make believe movies on the big screen, it's escapism but the dangerous part is it's made to look achievable. \n\nWhen the world looks closer and we can see all the amazing things everyone else has it becomes discouraging to see what we don't have ourselves. I lived on a small town and move to a big city....night and day differences but I never really worried about things if I never knew they existed.\n\nDating apps, online dating is the same brings the world of \"sex\" closer to you but still unobtainable by many. More choices mean more people will get overlooked or compared to someone else. If you had to pick a movie out of 100 but didn't know if there were any seats left you would probably pick the one you want to see. Sadly there is only a few seats and you don't know if you get in or not. You might have passed up on other good movies but you went with something you felt interested in. \n\nI think it's only a matter of time until we adapt as a society and change our mindset, sadly this doesn't help those in the thick of it",
