As a woman it pisses me off to see men forced to do the manual labor or the heavy lifting even if its 1 man and 10 women in the room. I'm not sure how common it is outside of my state, but I frequently see here, men forced to do the shitty work. \n\nI myself tried to help out where possible at my last job to ease the burden of it, but even then we (a coworker of mine) were told specifically by our boss to not move the truck bed boxes, the liquid transfer tanks and so on. The lady who I was partnered with and I, are both physically fit so we decided to sneak in those \"told not to do items\" and just team lifted all of it. We are fit enough to throw around 50lb animal feed bags 8 hours a day for 5 days and still come in on Monday, so why the hell were we told not to touch them and let the men do it.\n\nSome of my favorite instances are party set ups (men have to do the table and chairs) while the women do light things, to helping someone move. \"Hey men! Such and such is moving and we were asked to help move them. You ladies can stay here, we'll be back.\" Seriously, what the heck.\n\nYes I know women are perceived as weak, and a lot of us disturbingly are, but I just can't stand the fact that people where I live, expect men to do all the shittiest work while we are told to just sit tight. We should be helping out as much as we can. Even if a woman can't solo lift an item like a man can, get a partner and start moving stuff.\n\nNot sure if the general male population even cares or not, I've just heard a few complain about always being told to move the heavy stuff, and I myself hate seeing the way men are treated like work horses.",

Whenever we’re in pain it’s brushed off by people who always feel the need to comment that we dont know what true pain really is (e.g we don’t ever experience child birth or menstrual cramps)\n\nFrom a parental aspect we are viewed as the lesser parent both by society and the resources available. Not to mention the chance that some crackhead could try to take your kid because “he probably kidnapped them” and when it’s proven false we don’t get an apology.\n\nBut more than anything. We are viewed as disposable to society proven by the lack of awareness of mens issues and the fact that if we go homeless then nobody really gives a shit besides charities. You’d better bet that your at the back of the queue for housing because women on the street are viewed as more vulnerable.",

Just not here tho,  I dont like snakes\"   \n\nSo when we get home and our partner is like what's in the book bag and then we are like let me show you.  So then we open the bag and snakes come flying out and then Youre partner is crying and telling you.  NOOOO PUT THE SNAKES BACK IN THE BAG.  and you're like OH, OHHH MY BAD,  I thought you wanted to know what was in the book bag.  \n\nSo you end up apologizing to your partner for releasing the snakes and she's all confused on why you have a book bag full of snakes and you're like idk.  I've always had a book bag full of snakes.",

I knocked some doors and 10 mins later had my phone in my hand to call the police, next thing mum comes running out of a nearby house in hysterics, so all was well.\n\nAs I walked back to my car the woman told me that she had seen ther girl wandering around the road, but when I stopped she hurriedly got dressed to make sure nothing happened to the girl.\n\nLet me run that by you again, the  woman was OK with an 18 month old wandering around the road, but when a man stopped the girl was suddenly in danger, and we wonder why men are increasingly avoiding helping anyone for fear of being labelled.",

Men tend to be portrayed as sex-crazed maniacs who can never be nice to a woman unless there are ulterior motives at play.  I tend to be incredibly awkward around them for fear of ANYTHING I may do might set them in a \"men are awful\" rant.  Stories of lives (and careers) being ruined over false accusations also make dealing with women incredibly nerve wracking for me.  \n\nTaking this a step further would be talking about what's so bad about being a dad.  In much the same respect, dads are always painted as pushovers who are incapable of parenting because they're to 'lax.  I'm incredible self conscious of this when I take my kids to the park and a spat breaks out with other kids there.  Because of how I've seen men portrayed, I believe it to be the general consensus which causes me a great deal of anxiety over it.  If I go over solo, first assumptions are that I'm a my kid's dad and I don't care about what he did.  Worst still would be having this accusation if the other kid's a girl.  It would be believed that I'm raising my sons to be a no good \"deadbeat\" like me.  I have to ask my wife to go over and deal with it because I just can't.  \n\nBackground:  I was raised by a single parent (dad) and saw all the work he put in over the years and dealing with ALL of this, which has worked it's way into my own fears. And given how easily triggered and offended people are anymore, I can't believe the situation has gotten better at all.\n\nEdit:  spelling",

I explained to them that I was not comfortable speaking to people with mental health issues because for one I myself have not sorted out my own and because well, I had no idea how to even do the job. The response to these concerns were basically \"yeah well good luck\". \n\nAbout 6 months later some of the staff sent home were made to come back to the office one of which was a small 20 year old female, she had the exact same issues I did but was excused from all telephony duties.\n\nI had to go to my GP and have him excuse me from telephony duties because talking to people with mental problems all day everyday for over a year made my own so much worse and even now they are trying to rush me through my own mental rehabilitation so they can get me back on a phone. \n\nIt's just shit that because of the way I look they don't take it seriously at all.",

It’s always these customers that have been to 12 shops and only want the oil changed that don’t seem to think that cars wear out in various ways. I can tell one lady “ you need brakes because they are almost metal to metal” an she will say you just want my money because I’m a woman.  only to have her come back complaining we didnt tell her she needed brakes when they were low. Recently had a lady take her car elsewhere for a second opinion and the shop literally lied to keep her business instead of telling about the safety concerns she had with her car. She then complained that if she were a man I would have never told her anything about the control arm bushings that were torn and flopping around. Yeah because ya know, safety is only safety when a woman drives🙄",

There's been a massive movement in recent years for more diversity in clothing for bigger women, and rightfully so, but nothing for the guys outside specialty stores that cost an entire days wages for like 3 shirts. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on colour choice. You like black, white, navy, rust red and moss green? Cause that is all you're ever getting. I found a light blue shirt one day and damn near screamed to the heavens in adulation cause I could finally inject some actual bright colours into my wardrobe. \n\nThere's another place like an hour and a half north of me that has some bigger stuff, but it's all the same things with the added addition of flannels.

All feel tired all week. She complains I'm not there for her. All I do is for them. I don't buy clothes for me. I don't buy the food I want for me. I even. She goes to therapy and I would love to but I don't have the money for that. All my money goes to the house while hers can be destined for other non essentials because \"she needs s more normal life or she'll collapse\". I try to do what I can to help her not to feel burnt out while I feel I have much more things than her.  I know maybe I'm more resilient mentally and physically but she and other people sometimes forget I am not fine either. But I don't complain, i just suck it up, concentrate in gathering strengths again and keep going.",

But all the girls where I live are horse girls from middle school that never really matured much past that point, and girls are forced into this disgustingly narrow pigeonhole of sexism where they are socially programmed to idolize a husband, even if they're total pieces of shit.  I don't want that kind of girl, cause that's fucked up; I want someone who gets me and that I can be open with.\n\nSpeaking of being open, that shows vulnerability, and my family is not that.  It's taken me years of being a depressed bum to realize how fucked up things are; how feelings are meant to be real and talked about so you can grow and move forward in life.  And I just want one person to be close with.  That's the dream.  \n\nAnd about dreaming, only lazy losers day dream, not \"big grown men\".  \"Big grown men\" put their pants on their heads then shove them up their asses as they go to jobs they hate and complain about how everything in life is either a lie or a conspiracy all while descending into mental turmoil and chaos through the power of Facebook echo chambers.  Oh and then casually coerce their wives into accepting emotional and mental abuse \"in accordance with the Bible\".  Because Jesus would have negated and belittled women to simple man followers. \n\nOh and money.  If you don't have 2 cars, a house, a wife and kids, and a trades job by 26 you're a loser.  \n\nAnd make sure you agree with every insane alt-right political view in existence.  That gives you extra \"man points\".\n\nFuck me.

I'll even get with these women all the time, who project how they feel this way or how men only care about sex or their bodies.. As if every man is some horned up neanderthal.\n\nThen in the next instant, I come home from a difficult day at work or am honestly just tired and my dick can't get hard immediately because they're in the mood. All the sudden our entire relationship over the course of years changes in that very instant. As if my dick was the only thing that's ever mattered, and not how I feel or how I was to them as a person.\n\nI'm a strong believer that people as a whole, male, female, whatever else can all be equally shitty. I absolutely despise when any individual starts hating on one specific group of people or gender. It's so incredibly silly and shows you must've honestly had a pretty good life to believe that bullshit.\n\nI've never treated a woman this way. Never. Maybe people think I'm prude? I just try to be respectful because sadly, it seems like in many instances sex is usually the factor where things in a relationship start to become more defined. And I personally hate that sex usually will be more important to people. Saddens me.\n\nIs life honestly this dull? Just sex and money ultimately..?\n\nIt's confusing how much people dump on me also, which I honestly don't have a problem with. But no, as soon as me, the good looking strong guy apparently. If I start showing any weakness. I'm treated like an animal. I'm even degraded and called a literal bitch at times.\n\nI'm really tired of the double standards of being a man. We're not all bad and I'm generally tired of a lot of cultures period making it bad to simply show emotions.\n\nI wish I had a single person in my life who truly valued something more in me than my looks or how my body performs. This is exactly why I tend to get so turned off by anything sexual in my personal life, too much trauma or find it almost impossible to believe anything anyone tells me. I've truly been used all my life and tossed aside like a scrap a meat afterwards.\n\nI've really never been a forceful guy either. I'll always stick by someone I value and I will always work with them, if they wanted that and are willing. I can accept people moving on, but unfortunately it has been more than that in my life.",

Imagine all of the stigma already existing towards mental health and just compound that with societal standards.\n\nI was suicidal for a little over ten years, which naturally being a man leads you to the paradoxical notion of \"well if you were really manly you would have succeeded so you must be weak/lying\". My ex insisted that I wasn't depressed, that I was normal, but still wanted me to open up to her about my emotions. She knew I was struggling but still wanted me to work two or more jobs at the height of the pandemic solely to prove to her that I could support her because I guess that's what men are supposed to do. \n\nAdditionally, I was sexually abused by a male peer. I have to carry that trauma on my own to avoid the whole \"it doesn't sound that bad\" \"just get over it\" \"why didn't you do something?\" \"so you're gay?\". It has destroyed my relationships with many people.\n\nEventually I got sick of the abuse and feelings of helplessness. I tried to go get mental help, but there just aren't as many opportunities for mental healing for guys as there are for girls. There was only one open bed in the entire state the morning I went to the ER. While I was there (two weeks), I never got to see a therapist nor my social worker. It really feels like a \"man up and go get over your own mental health problems yourself\" kinda situation.\n\nI got out and my ex still didn't believe me, insisted that I was fine until I broke down and told her that she was the one who pushed me towards the edge. Then, suddenly, I go from getting \"just get over it and man up!\" to \"you need to be locked up somewhere, you're a threat to society!\".\n\nLuckily, I have a new girlfriend now and she is much more understanding and supportive. But now I have the inverse problem. Now it's getting chastised for not opening up, not talking about my emotions enough, me doing too much giving and not enough \"taking\" in a relationship. It's whiplash and I guess I can't stomach good treatment after everything. I've internalized my own toxic masculinity for use against myself.\n\nCan't a man just get love and comfort and support in his life? In a non-sexual, non-romantic manner? I just want someone to care about me, you know, and it feels like I'm judged for that, so you have to build up all of these walls of stoicism and toxic manly independence.",

There are ton of nuances to hard topics that are talked about in society and there are a lot of reasonings for things. However, as we become increasingly more aware of these nuances and issues we slowly talk less and less about them to the point where the topics become circular and worthless.\n\nAn example of this is even happening within the comments of this post. Over a few different comments we see men talking about how they hate being perceived as a threat. Which is followed by both men and women saying their is a reason for this and stating statistics, without ever addressing the issue of reporting within statistics. I don’t even mean just under representation but the fact that we still struggle to this day to properly label the things women have done is a cause as to why the statistics look the way they do. \n\nI just find it to be a massive oversight by society that we have slowly been learning more and more about traumas and the effects over mental abuse onto people and men are the only ones that are forced by a majority of society to deal with their own problems while also having to take care of and be responsible for the traumas of everyone including themselves.\n\nI hope this came out right, I am definitely willing to explain more.",

I actually work with a lot of illegal immigrants. I’m not saying I’m not privileged but for Christ’s sake I was begging for food 7 years ago. No job, no money, nothing but my guitar and case and I would make 60$ a day. I survived by any means necessary often drinking butter tea from Starbucks (hot water, free butter packets and stevia) just to get some calories. Begging for money every day.\nAnd it’s more than that. Just feels like everyone is waiting for their chance to pounce on me for anything I say that’s not 100% in agreement with everything they think. Like if I make a joke about trans people, (that trans people fucking approve of) some snowflake has to stand up to me, while I wasn’t making fun of anything. I literally just said “if I dye my hair red, does that make me transginger?” And people get mad about that. People who aren’t trans. And it’s like, you aren’t mad about the joke, you’re mad at white males and you’re taking every little chance you can to flip out on me because I am one. I’ve never held any position of power. I’ve never even managed anyone at any job I’ve ever had. Yet I have some imaginary power over people. Hell my heritage didn’t even enter the United States until slavery was long over (late 1800’s/early 1900’s) and still somehow it’s something I need to feel bad for. I went to the Boston KKK rally as a counter protester and people still somehow think I’m racist.\nThere’s more to it than I’m probably saying but I know someone’s about to jump down my throat and invalidate my experience.
