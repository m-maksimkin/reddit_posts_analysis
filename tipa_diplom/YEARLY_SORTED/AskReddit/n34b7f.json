He was ashamed because he felt like he was fetishizing an entire subset of people. He'd grown up being told that since he was white, that his specific sexual wants were racist and it tore him up inside. What the therapist had him do, is during an appropriate time, talk to a woman he was attracted to and go from there.  He eventually married a lovely young woman and had a couple of kids.\n\nI left that field after being in sessions with other types of sexual dysfunctions, people who had the overwhelming desires that would land them in jail for decades.

The answer is *everything*.\n\nOk, obviously I haven't heard *everything* before, but what I mean is that after a certain point in our career, there's nothing that weirds us out anymore, even if we're only encountering it for the first time.\n\nI've worked with literal cannibals and pedophiles before, so as far as weird/fucked up behavior goes, I don't think you can really go much further than that.  Everything else pales in comparison and feels unremarkable to me (although, of course, that doesn't diminish its meaning and significance to the person experiencing it).  You hear voices and see things?  You think about killing yourself?  You think about killing someone else?  You have a highly unusual kink/fetish?  You absolutely hate your perfectly innocent sibling and want them to fail?  There's a full spectrum of human experience; all of this stuff is normal.  Let's talk about it together!  This is what therapists are for.\n\nI work exclusively with teenaged girls at this point in my career.  I'm a man, so as you can probably imagine, new patients are sometimes terribly embarrassed to tell me things that they believe I might be uncomfortable hearing.  They can range from things that are incredibly innocent and common (e.g., \"I think my depression gets worse when I'm on my period\") to things that are pretty universally considered embarrassing or private to talk about for teenagers (e.g., \"I'm not enjoying masturbation as much as I used to\").

The problem is what is socially acceptable to express and what isn't. It is socially acceptable for two women to kiss, but not two men. Many times I have to talk with male clients about being comfortable in their skin and talking about the attractiveness of human beings. The curvature of a woman's body is lovely. A strong jawline is extremely attractive. It's okay to find someone of the same sex attractive. More than likely, one you talk about it you can move on from it.\n\n2. Many clients talk to me about abuse as I am a trauma therapist by nature. I will keep this sort and sweet. If you have trauma and you are looking to get over it you need to answer one question: \"What would my life be like if I absolved myself of all my trauma.\" I try to help most of my clients understand, the abuse they suffered was not their fault. In short, \"Hurt people, hurt people.\"\n\n3. Racism is a very twisted and toxic thought process. It's essentially saying: \"because I look a certain way, I am superior.\"\n\nMany of the clients I work with talk about race for one reason or another because, like it or not, we are all impacted by race. Racism was and still is a vital part of the American society.\n\nWith my white clients the questions are something like, \"Is this racist?\" \"Have I been racist to you?\" \"Am I a bad person for thinking this?\" \"Am I a racist?\" \"How do I not be racist?\"\n\nThe answer to these is, Yes. You are 100% racist.The structure of America is set up in a way that benefits white skin in particular. This is how the systemic racism works. On top of this, you need to realize racism has been around for over 400 years. It's not going to just magically go away because of 60 years of civil rights movements.\n\nHOWEVER, in my view the problem is: many white people think being racist means they are bad people. This is false. Being racist doesn't mean you are a bad person. It means you lack the insight to have empathy for a race other than your own. THATS OK! Usually that is solved by just getting to know more people of the race you lack empathy towards. Many of my white clients who are racist towards black people get off easy because I myself am black. I make a good starting point for them.",

When in actuality there‚Äôs going to be a series of questions we ask if someone admits this. There‚Äôs nuances to suicidal thoughts and professionals know that. We aren‚Äôt just going to push the button. There‚Äôs the series of questions we have to ask first. And after the questions such as, ‚Äúhow often?‚Äù ‚Äúdo you have an actual plan?‚Äù ‚Äúdo you want to hurt others?‚Äù ‚Äúhave you ever, or are you self harming?‚Äù ‚Äúdo you have vivid visual thoughts about your death?‚Äù ‚Äúdo you intend to carry out any of the plans you‚Äôve made or are these just thoughts you wouldn‚Äôt act on?‚Äù ‚Äúin the past 6 months have you taken any steps at all towards ending your life?‚Äù \n\nMost of my patients don‚Äôt actually plan to kill them selves. This isn‚Äôt to say the statement shouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously. But most of them are just having thoughts they don‚Äôt plan to act on. The most common answer I receive is, ‚ÄúI just want to sleep. I‚Äôm so tired. So, sometimes I think of if I sleep forever all of my problems will just go away. But I don‚Äôt really want to die.‚Äù It‚Äôs usually the sheer responsibility of life and all that has to be done weighing them down. \n\nNew patients or reoccurring patients are terrified of being committed to a psych ward (especially ones who‚Äôve already gone.) It‚Äôs for a good reason honestly. Unless you have a lot of money to go somewhere nice, state hospitals are terrible. People come back to me more traumatized than before, and we have a whole new set of problems. This setting is not really meant to heal anyone. It‚Äôs kind of just strictly there to baby sit you unfortunately. In serious situations this can be what someone needs when there are no other options. \n\nThe point is, suicidal thoughts are normal to a degree with certain mental illnesses. Obviously the greater of life‚Äôs pressures my patients face like death, illness, or losing a job, the more serious the thoughts can get. In those cases we‚Äôll pay closer attention if there‚Äôs bigger red flags. But patients who are experiencing depression, even to a minor degree may ruminate on death, and we know this. We don‚Äôt want you to be afraid to tell us because of the system that‚Äôs been created. \n\nIt makes me really sad that we‚Äôve created this environment where patients don‚Äôt want to be honest about these thoughts because of state hospitals or the ‚Äúred button‚Äù fear. Please don‚Äôt suffer alone. Whether you‚Äôre just ruminating or actually planning, tell someone, preferably your therapist. This could be a huge piece of information we‚Äôre missing in your treatment and we need to know what‚Äôs triggering it. There‚Äôs a good chance we could be making changes in lifestyle and meds. And on the other end there‚Äôs a chance being in the hospital, sucky as it is, could save your life. But before that‚Äôs decided, we need to hear it to know what you need.",

He knew he had to find a different way to achieve his goal of 10 ceilings per day.  Anything less than 10 ceilings per day was just not acceptable.  He considered grocery stores but knew that most of the ceilings inside of a grocery store were too high.  He considered breaking into businesses after hours but wanted to limit his criminal liability.  He even contemplated buying 10 outdoor sheds to place in his backyard but quickly realized that his backyard was not big enough, because he lived in an apartment.

            "text": "I work with a lot of anxiety and trauma clients  Whenever I ask if they would describe their experience as being anxious about being anxious, I get a lot of 'omg, yessss.' Anxiety has such a physical impact in the body (heart pounding, trouble breathing, feeling faint or cold, tunnel vision) that we become aware of our body's reaction before we even notice the anxious thoughts triggering the reaction. Then we panic about why our bodies are flipping out when we're not even aware of feeling threatened, and the anxiety compounds on itself.\n\n Anxiety is like an alarm system in our bodies to signal the presence of (real or perceived) danger. What would you do if your alarm was going off at your house? Check to see if there's a real threat (scan your environment/situation to ground yourself in the present), turn off the alarm (breathing exercises do help, along with mindfulness techniques like body scans), and then investigate what tripped the alarm (process thoughts around the situation that read like danger to you). It's also important to note that danger doesn't need to be a gun getting pulled on you. Panicking during a presentation that could impact your job and threaten the way you pay your bills and afford your life can feel pretty dangerous if you think about it.\n\nedit: I'm an anxious person myself, and I respond really well to learning/knowing more about an issue. If you're interested, look into polyvagal theory. It goes into great detail around the mind-body response when it comes to anxiety and trauma.

The reality is that nearly all of us have had such thoughts.  \n  \nIt's understandable. When we start therapy with a new client we are required legally/ethically to tell clients that one of the only reasons we would ever breach confidentiality is after hearing thoughts/plans of harming themselves (or other people) so the topic is discussed very seriously with potential serious consequences. This is taken MOST seriously (police will be called) when they have an active plan and/or date set.  \n\n  \nIn my own therapy, I once responded to this initial inquiry with \"*well not more than the 20,000 times since I was born [that it would end the pain of existence... existential inquiries]*\" He laughed and shared he could relate (which was an appropriate response based on our rapport).",

In general, I‚Äôve come to believe that people are quick to talk about what happens AROUND them but don‚Äôt always feel safe talking about what is going on IN them. At the end of the day, every single client I have had says they are so relieved to finally get something off their chest.

Which thereby created paranoid symptoms in that patient, when, in reality, the mother/sister were  contacting whomever possible, to \"cause problems,\" (fights divorces, pet thefts, job losses) between that patient and whomever possible.\n\nThroughout his life, the patient had heard from friends, spouses etc, that the mother and/or sister had made contact and slandered, BUT the patient failed to connect his biggest losses with the deliberate mother/sister sabotaging efforts.\n\nThe patient's experiences were easily confirmed through more than one person whom the mother and/or sister contacted.

It makes me gain weight easily and have a high level of testosterone and that only made it worse for my mother because she simply couldn't control my weight through any normal natural means.\n\nThe roughest thing is no one, including weight loss surgery doctors or the counselors they employed, ever once suggested or considered this was a problem with my condition. I had to go to an actual eating disorder clinic with a doctor who specifically treated people and a nutritionist who is specifically trained and a counselor who all worked together as a team.\n\nSo in a lot of ways these addictions especially the \"non-evil\" ones like gaming addiction or gambling addiction or sex addiction or food addictions are our last fortress of protection against the really bad things that happened that we're trying to cover up very deep in our subconscious and deep in our traumatic memories.\n\nAfter I finished my psychology degree in 2012 I started learning a little bit more about childhood post-traumatic stress and a lot more about how it actually affects your development of your brain chemistry. It is worth a read, but developing an addictive disorder is often a coping mechanism for that post-traumatic stress because it soothes that need within a child that the parent cannot soothe or the emptiness that the parents behavior has created.\n \nAnd food addiction it's one of the hardest things to admit because it's one of the easiest things to access to soothe bad feelings and to protect yourself from outside attention.  And the related disorders like anorexia and bulimia are simply all manifestations of the same pathology no matter if the patient is fat or thin or or average.  \n\nDon't be afraid to talk about it, but I do suggest finding a proper eating disorder therapist before pursuing weight loss surgery or if your control of your weight is dominating your life to the point where you feel that it's the reason why you can't do all the things you really want to do.",

This is a topic that has interested me recently and I‚Äôve spoken about it several times with my wife (Who is a School Psychologist - We‚Äôre a fun house!)\n\nAs a therapist, it‚Äôs important for me to really consider the form of question asked and how to answer said question. Words not only have meaning, they carry strong connotations that may be misleading or misinterpreted - Especially in a text only forum.\n\nI think this question might look slightly different at its core. How I understand it is, ‚ÄúWhat are some topics that individuals struggle or hesitate to disclose, but are actually somewhat common issues?‚Äù\n\n I don‚Äôt mean to change the question at all, and I really hope I didn‚Äôt here. I agree that fear plays a role for some individuals and, for others it might be anxiety or a feeling of shame. \n\nThey might hold back because they think it‚Äôs weird or they might think I‚Äôll think it‚Äôs weird! (For the record, absolutely nothing is weird to a decent therapist) Some might worry they‚Äôll be judged, treated differently, or reported to the police at times (Only imminent harm to others or self can break HIPAA, not other crimes). \n\nI believe that individuals hesitate to talk about certain topics or episodes because these incidents become much more real when they are discussed. They are not ready to deal with them in a meaningful way yet, and that‚Äôs ok. Denial and other psychological defense mechanisms are in play. Starting where the individual is means not rushing the process. Building trust and a safe place to talk about these issues is what therapy is in essence.\n\nThis brings me to the last part of the question. What issues are they mainly? I see many therapists on here identifying these topics, and we can see the range of them. From sexual assault (victim and perpetrator) to abortion, religious guilt, and thoughts of harm, whether they be passive or active. The heart of this question, I think, are which of these topics are common, and therefore, which of these topics ‚Äúshould‚Äù the individual feel less hesitation to discuss. Normalization, or normalizing experiences, is one of the most important component of therapy - Letting another individual know, through empathy and understanding (and an absence of surprise and judgement), that how they felt and how they dealt with a situation, is not only understandable, but ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or a ‚Äúcommon response‚Äù, allows these events to be broken down and processed further.\n\nIt does not matter if I have heard something similar, or whether this is my first time dealing with a particular topic or incident. All topics are ok to talk about because they are all a part of the human experience - All events are ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in that someone has likely gone through it, or will be through it sometime in the future. \n\nWe all have unique stories but in some ways, everything is ‚Äúcommon‚Äù to a degree. This is the paradox of human experience and what can unite us ultimately if we empathize with others.",
