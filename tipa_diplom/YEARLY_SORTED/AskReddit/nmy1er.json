There is no situation where being healthier is worse than being fat. Note how I say HEALTHIER, not exercising more or eating less, because doing too much or too little of those is bad. Being obese is not good for you, and if you cared about yourself and everyone else, you'd want them to live longer. And while it's no guarantee that being healthy will achieve that, there's definitely a higher statistical chance of it.\n\nAnd let's not kid ourselves, there are very few people in the world who look at fat people over healthy, curvaceous ones and say the healthy one looks gross. This isn't a matter of fat shaming, or that ridiculous belief people have that you need to be attracted to fat people otherwise you're an asshole. It's a matter of fact that in general, fat people are not attractive. There's a reason that e.g. Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johanson are body images that people aspire to. There's a reason Thor looks good on screen with rippling abs.\n\nYou can say what you want about plus sized models and shit to give people confidence, but this isn't something you can't change about yourself. You just don't wanna do it. And I don't believe any of your bullshit about how you can't help it or any of that junk. You can't build a house from thin air, so your morbidly obese 150 kilo ass needed material from somewhere. News flash; it came from your mouth. If you weren't eating excessively over what you needed to, you wouldn't have become that much of a fat ass to begin with. This is all just drivel so you can make an excuse not to change. If you don't like how healthy people are considered beautiful, but don't want to do anything about it yourself, that's no excuse to try and persuade everyone else to think otherwise just so you can keep eating your fried chicken 5 times a day. You're putting your effort into the wrong place. If you can't be bothered, you don't deserve it. Simple as that. \n\nNot every model has to be rippling abs, flat stomach all that junk. They should be normal sized. YOU are not normal sized. If the ultra skinny lifestyle shouldn't be advertised, then your ultra fat lifestyle shouldn't either. Stop it. Get some help.",

If you are truly a strong woman, you may just describe yourself as 'strong' when prompted because adding 'woman' to it changes nothing about the meaning of strong and thus is unnecessary.  \n\nKey take-away: If you have to repeat something about yourself to others, you are projecting what you wish you were but are not.  If you're truly a strong person, there's no need for you to let someone know, they will be able to see and infer that for themselves over time.\n\nSource: I am a woman in male-dominated circles/hobbies.  I've never once felt the need to describe myself as a 'strong woman', for my physical strength nor my emotional strength.  I'm just me.  It gets annoying that I can't be looked at as just 'strong' or for the content of my character or skills, I'm almost always solely getting lumped under the 'strong independent woman' label which has virtually no meaning now because screeching attention-seekers have driven meaning out of any label they get their hands on.  \n\nMy point is it's not wrong to call someone or be called a 'strong woman' but context matters a lot.  It can either be a genuine compliment (i. e., \"my mother is a very strong woman\") or extremely dismissive that your 'strength' is just the 'woman's version of strength.'",

Asking someone if they feel better does not make things *better.* Consequently, it is good to know how one feels inside, but not necessarily for it to be one's primary deciding factor as a person. This makes almost any problem in human history. The main point here is that humans are \"intellectual\" beings, thus, we must operate with the primordial essence of us; to think. Today, a majority of people have a problem with this. They thought that what they feel inside is the main problem, in reality, it is not. What one feels inside only indicates a logical and reasonable cause. Drowning yourself with feelings just to feel good because you feel bad is the pinnacle of stupidity.",

The problem is that it means 'don't be fake'. \n\nThe problem lies in this. Being \"yourself\" hasn't been working. I can't sit at home playing videogames, eating junk food and expect a woman to fall into my lap. Or going out and talking to women. I've taken no steps to improve myself. I need to work out, eat healthy, dress nice for my body/style, and put effort in getting to know them. \n\nIf you're doing something and it's not working you need to change it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou might be reading this and get mad, say I'm sexist/misogynistic etc. But think about this. If I want a woman who is beautiful I have to be the kind of man she finds attractive. That doesn't mean be fake or being someone I'm not. That means improving myself to be better than I am now. If she doesn't find me attractive after I've made myself attractive then I'll find someone else. But if you're a dirty, fat, lazy slob you can't expect an attractive person to find you attractive. You've done nothing to make yourself attractive to others. Like it or not attractiveness is the first thing people judge you on when they see you. \n\nI'll take a woman who is fat who makes an effort over someone who is thinner who walks around in pajama pants, no makeup and their hair isn't done at all. To me decent clothes, makeup and taking some effort to look attractive is attractive to me. \n\nSo \"just be yourself\" doesn't mean make no effort to be attractive to the person you find attractive. It just means don't be fake. If you unload trucks in a warehouse don't pretend to drive a Mercedes and say you're a financial analyst. Own your shit. But make an effort to improve yourself so others find you attractive.",

Don't expect others to fill your cup, don't rely on others to support you, don't trust that others will be there for you when you need them.\n\nI agree that it's important to become more comfortable with yourself, to become more mindful of your own triggers and to find ways to manage them on your own. Relying solely on others for that is the path to codependency, and that can get abusive or toxic very quickly, often in insidious ways.\n\nBut what I patently reject is the notion that you can only be happy with someone else if you are happy on your own first. Being lonely is a natural thing -- we are social creatures by nature, and we need some form of connection with others. Admittedly, the degree varies from person to person, but everyone needs some amount of socialisation to remain an empathetic and well-balanced individual.\n\nSo to reject someone because they are lonely and need comfort, or to tell someone or imply that they need to \"figure their shit out before I can see you\", or that the desire to be social or romantic is \"foolish\"? That's unresolved trauma driving those responses, under the guise of promoting \"self-care\". \n\nYou can be handling your shit 110% and still feel lonely and want to see people. I can be perfectly fine at home alone, but wish there was someone else to share it with. The two are not mutually exclusive. \"Self-care\" means different things to different people, and for some that means being social. Don't criticise that.",

Yes, there are many people who are born knowing their sexuality and/or their gender identity, or who know it from a very young age. But a lot of people also experience sexuality/gender as a growing, changing part of themselves. How you see your sexuality when you’re 16 may be different from how you see it when you’re 35. And that’s ok, in fact it’s perfectly normal. I’m not saying that being proud of being “born this way” or using the term “born this way” positively is completely toxic, but the fact that it’s become the standard perception of queerness makes people rush to find a label when they start questioning, as well as causing people to think that they’re “faking it” when they notice their sexuality changing.",

When we think of ‘I’ or our ‘self’ we aren’t including this passenger in our minds even though they have experienced all of our traumas, joys, and everything in between, throughout our lives. They ride in almost complete silence, as injured as we have ever been but without the ability to voice it. \n\nI *believe* (firm emphasis on ‘believe’) that this consciousness has some role in our function and that it does interplay with our minds in some limited fashion. Wether it be simply to act as our global attention, or that darker voice that reminds you of that past trauma right before you fall asleep, or the annoying voice that keeps the earworm stuck playing over-and-over. Whatever its role I’m fairly certain it exists based on the evidence, but its role I can only guess at.\n\nHere’s my advice: be kind to your inner passenger. Treat it like the hurt soul that it is and show it compassion. When that trauma shoots to the front of your mind, don’t ignore it, but accept it and say, “yes that was bad, but we got through it.” When you stub your toe don’t get mad at yourself but say, “don’t worry mistakes happen, you keep my toes safe most of the time.”\n\nJust be kind to that voice inside, be compassionate and understanding. You know everything they’ve been through and they know you inside and out, so be friends, they need it.\n\n...now if I’m full of shit or just plain batshit, think of this: does the advice still have merit? Even if we don’t have a silent/dark passenger isn’t it still good advice to be kind to your inner self? Try it for awhile, no one will know but you...and maybe your passenger.",

I told them since the last time I spoke to them that we had a death in the family. They literally said nothing after. But they were overwhelmed/busy and therefore not “obligated” to reply back to me...the next time they got back to me they were asking if we could chat on the phone like we usually do. I didn’t answer right away but text later saying I could talk....never heard anything after that reply.\n\nThis is so many of my adult friendships right now and every time I talk to someone about it everyone is always talking about the fact that no one is obligated to talk to you. Like no shit! I had no idea that people have free will. But then don’t hit me up when you feel like it and expect everything to be cool.

In doing this, it implies that self care is reactionary.

Again, it really involves understanding yourself and how you navigate your day-to-day. With self awareness, you can then understand what may be best for yourself.

I’m so tired of hearing “I know I’m selfish and I know I need to work on that/I’m sorry I was rude it’s something I’m working on/I didn’t mean to hurt you I just...blah blah blah”.

Wake up every day and become a better person. Never stop, never give it up. Keep loving yourself and taking care of yourself.\n\nI saw a clip of Warren Buffet talking to some high schoolers, and he said something like \"you get your dream car, any car you want, any in the world. You choose... now you have that car, but the catch is, this is the only car you will ever get. You can't ever get another one. What do you do? You take care of that car like crazy, you baby it, you get it everything it ever needs so it doesn't fail on you.\n\nNow obviously that's not true, you can get other cars. But that IS true for your body. You only get one, one body, one mind, one soul. You have to take care of it because you can't get another.\"\n\nI think that's very true. So many people with health and weight problems, even me. And I'm working on getting back in shape and turning my life around. I'm so sick of being in the situation and shape I am in. So instead of being bitter and angry and lashing out at others over my weight or my lifestyle, I'm changing it. Others criticize me? Say I'm fat? Good, I'm going to change that so that I know they're wrong. I'm not going to sit here and say I'm healthy or I'm beautiful the way I am or I'm entitled to love. \"Someone needs to love me for me\" no, fuck you, that's toxic as shit. You're saying you're stagnant and refusing to change and you wonder why no one wants to be with you. It shows that you have given up on yourself already, how does that look for a future relationship? A future career?\n\nNothing is more attractive or strong than a person who can recognize their flaws, plan accordingly, and overcome them.\n\nTHAT is what \"love yourself\" means.",

Nope. I'm just giving in to diet culture and scam doctors and the beauty industry. \n\nI'm fat, and I love myself and respect my body, not in spite of being fat or because I'm fat. I just think that no matter my weight I should treat myself kindly and not hide in the dark because I'm a disgusting flab monster, or flaunt myself in ways I'm not comfortable with for the sake of body positivity. Now I'll admit, a lot of medical practitioners do have prejudice against fat people (I was told I had indigestion from a \"poor diet\" that would be fixed by \"eating right and losing weight,\" which turned out to be a softball sized ovarian cyst that was twisting my ovary and causing it to die). And, a lot of dieting and exercising advice is confusing, bullshit, not applicable to the individual, or downright harmful.

It’s just that you’re so numb, hollow and depression-ridden that looking at your life and going, “Hey, there is so much here to be happy about!” just becomes impossible.\n\nIt makes depressed people feel worse, because they feel that they *are* ungrateful and failing as people if they can’t cough up some gratitude towards the Universe every day. \n\nIt also implies that *everyone* has something to be grateful for, and they’re failing in life because they’re just not grateful.

Some relationships are not in your best interest to maintain, especially when the other person is still actively destructive to your life, or even a legitimate threat. A lot of times the expectation of forgiveness erodes our personal boundaries, like with abusive partners who beg you to “give” them forgiveness. Even when forgiveness genuinely *does* happen, it’s not necessarily going to do anything whatsoever to fix the issues the person might be struggling with afterwords, like PTSD, financial issues, job loss, depression, etc. \n\nSometimes people make mistakes, and we should all give as much grace as we can for human fallibility; but a lot of times people can hurt you because they’re just destructive influences.

Friend was recognizing and observing that if she was feeling uncomfortable, it was because one of her boundaries was being crossed—and that having her boundaries crossed was NOT OKAY. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I am in full support of cutting out toxic relationships, and enforcing boundaries.\n\nBut it got to the point where she was flagging *any* kind of social discomfort or minor conflict as toxic, boundary-crossing abuse that had to be cut out, immediately. Like, someone is boring you at a party with their sad story? Abuse, cut them out. Someone is leaning on you a lot lately for emotional support? Abuse, they're asking for free emotional labor and that's abuse, cut them out. \n\nI think friend eventually came around and recognized she was taking things too far, but it was a bit of a wild ride while it lasted. \n\nIt led me to this book, [Conflict is Not Abuse](https://www.amazon.com/Conflict-Not-Abuse-Overstating-Responsibility/dp/1551526433), which outlines the dangers and problems with overstating harm, or conflating quote unquote \"normal\" conflict with abuse.

I am my own person; I am worthy of love and respect from others and myself; and I deserve better than constant heartbreak and emotional manipulation from people.\n\nMeanwhile, the loving and supportive partner I’ve been with these past few years has helped me see myself with more kindness. They’ve shown me that the physical parts I hate about myself, are attractive and appealing to at least one person out there. They remind me of my abilities and strengths when I’m insecure and uncertain. They’ve helped me build, understand, and respect boundaries—both for myself and others.\n\nMy partner and I have grown a lot these past few years. Their love for me, and mine for them, has helped both of us love ourselves more, by becoming better versions of ourselves.\n\nSo, is it wise to know and respect your self-worth and boundaries before getting involved in a relationship? Yes, absolutely! But is it required? No, I don’t think so.

            "text": "“Trust your instincts. They’re usually right.” \n\nSometimes ya this can be great advice. But when that person has chronic or severe anxiety, this can be awful advice. When you have GAD (or worse), your body treats everything like a high level threat, so you are constantly fighting with yourself about whether or not your fear is justified.\n\nYour ‘instrincts’ can randomly tell you that you are about to die from some silly thing. You know it’s silly and you’re embarrassed that you’ll look ridiculous if you listen to it, but at the same time, your body is screaming at you to get to safety. \n\nMy own embarrassing example of this is when once in the shower, I realized nothing smelled very strong. Well, you know what has no scent? Carbon monoxide. Well, fuck, now my body is yelling at me to run half-naked outside to save myself or risk being found dead and fully naked with an absurd water bill on the horizon. That whole time I’m in the shower my instincts are telling me I’m about to die, but I know I can’t let that instinct take over. I need to try and work myself out of this. To do that, I have to ‘risk my life’, which is how it honestly feels in that moment. Of course, I wasn’t really. But my instincts told me I was.\n\nThis is a pretty weird example, but I use it to point how anxiety can twist what most people would call your ‘gut feeling’. This cycle of thought happens to me constantly (well, it’s better now. Yay therapy and medication) and usually over seemingly simple things. So when there’s a big decision to be made, you bet your ass that my ass is on DEFCON 5 (or whichever one is real bad).\n\n\nBeyond that, it’s messed up when those same people or just people who invalidate your mental health problems, use this your anxiety-ridden instincts against you. “You’re being ridiculous. You’re just letting your anxiety take over. You need to calm down already.” In these moments, they are basically acknowledging that anxiety does make assessments and decisions more complicated. Thats convenient for them at the moment, but when they try and say that “your anxiety is just in your mind, you to just trust yourself” they are suddenly denying that reality.\n\nIf you’re trying to be loving by wanting them to trust themselves and then invalidating the moments where they are being honest and clear about what they are feeling, then it’s ‘toxic’, yes, but also extremely detrimental to your relationship with that person, detrimental to their ability to trust that they can go to you for help, and making them feel even more confused and insecure in what they are feeling and thinking.\n\nI do want to make the distinction here. That in therapy, I am learning to trust myself. It’s an important step to learn. But if you tell them to ‘trust their instincts’, while denying their reality, you’re not helping them. Your pulling the old ‘well it worked for me’ or ‘your just making excuses’ cliche. Don’t do that. It may make you feel good, but it ain’t good.\n\nI don’t know. This is my experience. Maybe I’m the only one. If so ignore me, but not before you do make sure to hit that bell, subscribe, and like the video.",

That can be pretty skewed opinion, especially for those who lean defensive or have challenging interpersonal relationships themselves.  So it’s a problem when we equate my own irritable opinion of someone else as objective truth (they ARE toxic, when I am clearly not able to factor everything in).\n\nWe need to work on social interactions and interpersonal relationships, folks.",

Wrong for so many reasons. Some people are born with mental problems that leads them down very dark paths. And I don't just mean the Casey Anthonys and Jim Joneses of the world. Some people are natural manipulators, have addictive personalities, lack empathy, have violent tendencies, are prone to depression, or otherwise messed up in some way. Are they supposed to believe that they're on the right track because hey, that's just how you were born, right on!\n\nThrowing in \"God makes no mistakes\" is first of all a defense against criticism because that means if you don't agree, you're saying God's wrong. But it's also despicable when the world is full of people who, through no fault of their own, are disabled in some way. God makes no mistakes, so you being born with Down Syndrome, or without functioning legs, or with a congenital disease that means you're not going to live past your teens? Totally perfect!\n\nWhat astounds me is that if these words came from the mouth of a preacher (and many a time they have), the would have been discredited immediately, even by other religious people. But Gaga was just trying to be LGBT-friendly, so she gets a pass? Bullshit. You don't get to hold up the \"Ally\" banner as a shield from criticism. No one's perfect, you're not on the right track just because you were born a certain way, your lyrics are toxic, and you know you're wrong because you had to throw in both the \"God defense\" and the \"pro-LGBT defense\" just to protect yourself.\n\nAlso, let's not overlook the fact that the song uses \"cholo descent\" and \"Orient\" to refer to nationalities, tells disabled people to rejoice in their disabilities, and opens with the foundational statement of a mother telling her kid \"just keep doing what you're doing, you're perfect\", which is completely the wrong thing to tell a child (as opposed to teaching lessons and providing guidance).",

It's a hard process to try and not say what u really think because what you think/your opinion it's bad and it was a long way to learn that this is true, as hurtful as it can be to me.\n\nEveryday it's a hard day to go out of home and not being toxic, aggressive, racist, homophobic etc. I'm into exercises now but i'm doing it alone because i can't tolerate people around me besides my family, so i'm pretty much a loser at this point in life and i'm swallowing a bunch of things at work, but i'm really trying to improve as a person.\n\nSome good advice that i received was to stay away from world news (mostly bad) , stay away from social media (i only have whatsapp and come to reddit to mostly read) and stay away from 4chan (at least the threads i saw)\n\nAnd the one i'm really working but is pretty hard is try is auto-sabotage or putting myself down everytime like the unworthy piece of of s that i know i'm. Life is pretty hard to me at this moment and i really wish to skip it. Also, i don't have the courage to just kill myself. Ofc i'm a coward on top of all that.  \n\n\nEdit : Edit to add tl dr   \n\n\nTL DR : ''be yourself'' it's a pretty bad advice when you're a shit person.",

In my personal opinion, body positivity should be for people with physical characteristics that they cannot change (scars, amputees, rare skin mutations, etc.) not as being an excuse for being overweight. It physically makes me cringe when overweight and obese individuals use \"body positivity\" as an excuse to not live a healthy lifestyle. I want to see a trend where overweight individuals track their healthy fitness and eating habits with their followers instead of doing nothing and calling it normal.\n\nJust calling overweight people \"plus-sized\" is basically calling anorexic people \"petite\". Which is another thing that annoys me. Everyone can agree that anorexia is unhealthy and dangerous to one's health, but then call obesity healthy and normal. IT ISN'T. Stop calling it \"plus-sized\" and \"body positive\" and take care of yourself. Trust me, as someone who has been there, your life becomes so much less stressful and you start attracting people.

Honestly, that is so egocentric, as long as you are not absolutely independent. If you want stuff from society you have to give stuff (meaningful stuff!) to society. You can’t just profit from other people and then only care about your own life and money. For example I followed an Influencer for a long time until they told their followers that they considered emigrating somewhere else because the taxes in Germany are so high (he is a doctor and they are very wealthy). Like, no, you obviously profited from our system, time to give something back so people with less possibilities can life a decent life?? \n\nAnother one is the objectification of overweight women or POCs. Many say it is empowering but it’s still objectification, which is bad. Concerning overweight people they deserve respect, of course, but there is nothing to romanticise an unhealthy lifestyle. And of course the objectification of POCs is really concerning (called positive racism). \n\nLast one: If you can’t imagine being a parent you are under no obligation to get kids. Of course I’m not talking about bad parenting or getting is danger due to medical conditions. But like in the first example it is often used by people who say that they don’t want to live another lifestyle and who are kind of egocentric. Fact is that our society need young people, if not you have a real problem (example Germany: The younger generations have to work until they are really old, often five to ten! Years longer than our Grandparents because we obviously pay the rent of the older generation and less people for the same amount of old people means that one young person has to pay more). My father for example once told me that he could not imagine himself as a father when he got me (age 30, so not young!), but I can say that he is a really good father. It depends on your ability and you willing to improve and learn. Many people are not born to be good with children, but they learn and become very good parents!",

In other similar pictures (mostly from Latino Facebook groups) it is a drawing of an ACTUAL young girl whose kindness brings an ACTUAL thuggish looking man down to his knees.\n\nThis is absolutely fucking disturbing. It gives females a false sense of empowerment by claiming it's not God, but the girl's naietivity that her kindness can turn a person around. This is a direct Segway to an abusive relationship because it does not show the Lord or other external factors that can contribute to changing that person's life.

Secondly people are different, so if you disagree with me, that is totally okay.)\n\nWhen I was younger, I was in a bad place mentally. It was mainly do to anxiety and a lot of self batwing thoughts, which over time turned into thought of offing myself. (I won’t go into it, in case I trigger someone, but just know that I am okay now, I wasn’t back then) \nWhen I started to get help, I heard a lot of people saying that I had to get these thoughts out of my head, and that was my end goal. However, I think this mindset is kinda toxic. When I was told that the thoughts I had were bad, and I needed to get them out of my head, it only made stuff worse. I would hate it when ever they came, and I would be frustrated, because what ever I did, they were still there. It only made me feel more broken, and like I wasn’t working hard enough to get out of my situation. They were still there, so clearly I was doing something wrong. That was until I found one guy, who gave me another perspective. He told me that hating the thoughts wasn’t a way to go, because the goal shouldn’t be for them to go away. If they do, that’s great, but my goal should be like any other mental illness. I was supposed to learn to live with it. When I had a panic attack, I should simply get through it. Let it come out, and don’t hate myself for feeling this way. He helped me make the feelings easier to handle, and to this day they still come from time to time. However, now I will at most need a good cry and some comfort from the people close to me, after that I can keep going with my life, and I feel way more at peace. \n\nTLDR: don’t expect to get ride of negative feelings and thoughts, and don’t beat yourself up for having them. Instead, simply learn how to keep livening with them, without them controlling you happiness.",

In that context, the advice given is essentially to \"bury your head in the sand and you'll feel better,\" which might be true, but if you can bury your head in the sand from immense systemic suffering that others are going through (in a place where you can do something about it, e.g. your country) you are privileged and are exploiting that privilege to ignore the suffering so you can be happy.\n\nAnd if you think I'm saying you must suffer on social media, just read the part again where I said what aspect of the advice I'm fine with.

But we don’t understand how serious of a disorder it is to binge-eat high-calorie, low-quality, food (just pick up a big bucket of ice cream, or go for the burger with fries, when we feel low, anxious or down). It is not even about the “getting fat” part that concerns me, it is about what your mind goes through that is not being addressed properly, and that you are contributing to your body’s general feel-bad sensation.\n\n\nIf you’ve had a bad day, don’t turn to food to sooth yourself.

Where this becomes an issue is there will *always* be someone better at *something* than us. So if your self-worth and value are tied to something you ultimately have no control over, self-esteem will always let you down. Always.\n\nInstead, practice self-compassion, the point of which is to be kind to yourself. To quote Dr. Kristin Neff:\n\n>Self-compassion involves being kind to ourselves when life goes awry or we notice something about ourselves we don’t like, rather than being cold or harshly self-critical. It recognizes that the human condition is imperfect, so that we feel connected to others when we fail or suffer rather than feeling separate or isolated. It also involves mindfulness — the recognition and non-judgmental acceptance of painful emotions as they arise in the present moment. Rather than suppressing our pain or else making it into an exaggerated personal soap opera, we see ourselves and our situation clearly.  \n>  \n>It’s important to distinguish self-compassion from self-esteem. Self-esteem refers to the degree to which we evaluate ourselves positively. It represents how much we like or value ourselves, and is often based on comparisons with others. In contrast, self-compassion is not based on positive judgments or evaluations, it is a way of relating to ourselves. People feel self-compassion because they are human beings, not because they are special and above average. It emphasizes interconnection rather than separateness. This means that with self-compassion, you don’t have to feel better than others to feel good about yourself. It also offers more emotional stability than self-esteem because it is always there for you – when you’re on top of the world and when you fall flat on your face.\n\n(From [here.](https://self-compassion.org/why-self-compassion-is-healthier-than-self-esteem/))",

However, it turns out your dog is fine. Was the sadness you experienced valid and real?  Yes of course. But did it match with objective reality? No. (So for example it would then not be valid to be rude to someone you falsely believed ran over your dog or something).\n\nThere has to be a way to reality check emotions and \"your feelings are never wrong, your feelings are always valid\" leaves out that crucial part of the equation.\n\nWorse yet is emotional reasoning, which is the logical end to this thinking, and which afflicts many cluster B disordered individuals, for example. This is when someone STARTS with how they feel and sets about using spin and denial and projection/gaslighting to force external reality to conform to their internal state of feeling. \n\nExample, someone feels insecure, so they suspect their partner is cheating. \n\nTheir partner ISN'T actually cheating and tells them so when asked, but the other person just says to themselves \"Well they must be lying bc why else would I FEEL worried about that?  My feelings are never wrong and everyone says trust your instincts\" and then they break up with that person or cheat on them in retaliation etc.  \n\n(Disclaimer is of course sometimes this would be true and they correctly sense their partner is actually cheating...but this opposite scenario is also possible and advice to never question your emotions gets perverted into never questioning your perceptions that you're basing your emotions on and/or allowing your emotions to distort).",

Focusing only on money neglects emotional honesty and can make a person apathetic to people, which only creates a vicious cycle of loneliness. \n\nA similar one I struggled with for a while is the notion that “I’m going to get so rich and make people pay for missing out on me”. That’s such a toxic way of life because it eats at you while creating a need for the approval of others. You have to live your life and move on as best you can and learn to forgive others.

Demanding and exhausting people clearly exist, but there’s a line between a draining “psychic vampire” who dumps personal trauma on you every time you interact for hours and never lets you get a word in edgewise, and a friend who is in crisis or needs to complain about something that has bothered them.\n\nThe overuse of these buzzword terms speaks to a complete intolerance for emotional discomfort. People have become such pussies who need to be coddled and comfortable constantly that it’s costing them their friendships and eventually their social lives.\n\ninb4 “but not everyone has empathy”: I’m not an empathetic person. At all. I have to synthesize empathy and listen to people all the time! Every time! It’s uncomfortable, but it is rewarding to your bond with that person, and it helps people, so I listen to people and talk to them when they open up to me. So, to my “sociopaths”, actual advice given to me by my therapist: Don’t coddle yourselves! What are you, a pussy? There are benefits! When you help talk someone down from crisis, they will like you more. Your bond will be closer.

When I say this I mean be nice about it, like: \"You know, I think the ladies would dig you if you started lifting some\" **or the closest fat free/non dairy option for you.

Have a good one.**\n\nWhen I say \"supporting people in being fat\" what I mean is don't okay being fat just because it's a normal everyday thing.  I also don't mean to fat shame people you pass on the street for not only eating fish and celery and lifting 200+ lbs on a bad day.  Being fat isn't good for your physical, mental, emotional, or basically any health that affects you, so *all of them.*  The whole \"body positivity\" train has gone from women with \"\"\"\"undesirable\"\"\"\" characteristics (like \"\"\"too small\"\"\" of breasts) to a bunch of obese 9th graders tipping the bus suspension 30^(o) and then they rate themselves a 9.5/10 on Snap.  Stop.  It's gross.  Being fat isn't okay/cool.  It was attractive in the 7th-fucking-century AD because being fat meant you were powerful and you had an excess of stuff and you COULD be fat.  It was rare.  It meant you used your brain and went to parties and never used your body.  Now it isn't.  Now it means you're a lazy piece of shit who plays games all day.\n\nI've started working out, trying to not be fat, been doing it for like 3 months, and OH MY GOD have I watched my productivity spike.  I've dropped 20 lbs, feel way better about myself, and have been getting WAAAY better grades in school (from like barely passing to 4.0).   The best part is it just gets easier to keep up.

You have those feelings about what others say for a reason and they’re very real and valid. What you choose to do with them is your own choice, but don’t condition yourself to suppress them. We’re supposed to feel negative things sometimes. If you only ever looked at what was beautiful you’d trip and hurt yourself, and see the ugly anyway. To pursue and expect a consistent uplifting and warming feeling is, ironically, setting yourself up for disappointment and ultimately unsustainable. All of our senses and feelings are how we function and are supposed to be there. \n\nCare what other people think. Acknowledge it and consider it, then rationally decide what to do with that info, even if it’s just thanking them for sharing an opinion and moving on. If someone is just simply insulting you, consider why they would do that. Sometimes come to the conclusion that they’re just being an asshole, and other times maybe consider that you are. Take everything into consideration to make the best informed decisions. Care what people think, don’t be a sociopath blindly following your satisfactions. And that, in absolutely 0 ways is saying “follow instructions”.",

This in turn can transform 'anger that wants to keep us alive' into 'anger that wants revenge' etc.  \nSince few people have full acceptance for their own anger, we mostly see reflections of the judged form of anger and this reinforces the false image that 'anger is bad'. Love your anger because anger is a form of love that is moving to keep you alive.

So when a person says to love yourself, it’s not helpful in the way it’s intended.\n\nLoving yourself doesn’t mean to always look at yourself and love what you see as is. To love yourself is to do what’s best for yourself as well. It doesn’t mean to just always be happy with how you are, it’s a way of saying that you should care about yourself beyond what emotionally sustains you. Sometimes you have to deal with your problems and try to grow as a person. Because loving yourself isn’t staying the same. Loving yourself is changing for the better—whether the better is healthier or simply kinder.\n\nI think it’s toxic in a way, because people who suffer from disorders or addictions can be told that and not understand it. Somebody heavily overweight could hear, “love yourself,” and think that all they have to do is love who they are now, and whatever comes after that may harm them or cause massive problems is just something to endure.\n\nAnd it’s the same for just about anybody, I think. I find that loving myself is pretty difficult seeing as I’m very ugly. I have things I’m proud of, obviously—I exceed in writing skills—but I can’t love what I look like. In fact, I absolutely fucking hate the way I look. I’m depressed and a bit overweight too.\n\nI know this is something I have to fix. But I guess I’m somewhat between. I try to improve myself, but I in no way feel any love for my body.\n\nThis became too much about me, so... My point is, I think it should be widely clarified what it means to love yourself. I think people would benefit if they were to love themself by more than just embracing problems or flaws that aren’t positive traits.

It should be comforting advice that you will be there with them to help them love themself and improve themselves. Because that’s friendship and support more than anything in my opinion.",

But this concept is also used to justify spouting every possible passive aggressive crap like “I think gays are dangerous and we should not give them rights” (pretty popular on boomerland aka Facebook) but also is a cover used for people who want to present opinions against facts - “I think the earth is flat and you can’t deny my personal opinion”-. The last one of quite grating: facts are absolute, until you can present a proof that they’re actually incorrect. You can’t have an “opinion” against a fact, you can have a counter thesis that you have to correctly prove. \n\n* your body is perfect the way it is\n\nBesides the fact that it’s quite cheesy, on a surface level it’s a lovable concept: you’re born without a leg? You can’t control it, you can’t do shit about it, it’s not your fault, don’t let others judge you for that, they’re in the wrong. You don’t want to follow the beauty standards like “women must be thin”? It’s fine, you shouldn’t live by a standard imposed by someone else, and no one is right in telling you otherwise. Point is, if you’re obese -and not because of a medical condition-, dear, you’re not “perfect the way you are”, you are in a unhealthy condition. If you’re ultra pale because you never see the sun (spoiler alert, this is me) you’re not “perfect”, you have a severe vitamin d deficiency. These are not grounds to justify other people mocking you, but absolving you by calling you “perfect” implies that you have nothing to do on your part, it implies that “no matter what, your body is ok”. Listen, if you decide to own the fact that you don’t care about being in good shape and decide to eat like a horse, ok, whatever, your body, do what you want. Just don’t come up with stuff like “I’m perfect” because, yeah, you’re medically not. \n\n* if they refused you, they’re the ones missing out \n\nI get that it’s mostly used to comfort a friend, and, I mean, every one of us is bound to say this sentence at some point, but it’s factually wrong. If someone doesn’t want you (be it a lover or a workplace) well, you might just not be a good fit. It’s not a matter of “deserving”, you are simply not desired. Bonus point, you may actually be in the wrong: maybe that girl was interested in you, but your racist ideology made her run for it. So you know, try not being racist? Or maybe that company was ready to give you a job, but they saw you constantly scratching your butt during the interview, not exactly the most pleasant thing to have in a work place. So, I don’t know, try not being gross?",

In our world today, I've noticed that so, so many people try and use social media as a platform for uplifting and encouraging messages. We see shit about the Kardashians/Jenners daily, but so many people (specifically women) promoting these weird fads. Whether it be posting about weight/looks, \"love yourself how you are!\", or just \"positive\" random quotes they see, these women/men/people don't understand how that can actually make some things worse for others. \n\nAlso, I appreciate that mental health has become more important and talked about freely, but I come across so many inaccurate portrayals of the severity of those issues. I don't care if you're rich, famous, poor, whatever it may be - every one is different. \n\nI appreciate that issues about women have been mentioned way more now (sexual harassment, body/\"slut\" shaming, equal pay, etc) but, and I'm sorry if this sounds terrible, but as a woman, I've become exhausted looking on my phone or computer and coming across several articles or whatever about what women find inappropriate and why \"men aint shit!\" As someone who has been the victim of physical and sexual abuse from males, I appreciate men getting more of a hint of what not to do and to shut their bull shit down, but for God's sake... it's like every thing I see now is about that. I'm all for girl power (if that's still a saying), but I feel that in the attempt to become equal, we've become more obnoxious and overdramatic to some extent.\n\nLastly, have a hobby, but also have a job (if you need to). If you don't have a typical hobby (exercising, reading, traveling, crafting, etc)... THAT IS OKAY. Not every hobby or cliche hobby has to work for everyone. I feel worse about myself every time someone says I need to find a hobby to be happy. Just because my \"hobbies\" don't align with everyone else's interests or don't \"count\" as hobbies, doesn't mean shit. \n\nThanks for this post.",

These women were just buying these things on an impulse without having all the necessary tools like a sanitization device for the stones. This also implies that you can refine your feminine energy by putting a stone in your vagina. Someone with discernment could recognize this as a marketing scam and knows that the world has a very loose perspective on true feminity. Therefore, every single individual must define their own levels of feminine and masculine energies.\n\nA healthy ego will allow you this clarity as you can recognize the egotistical ways of the world. In absolute absence of ego, a person is just a pawn for the world to move around to its liking. We all have egos here.

If your eyesight is weak, you can't be a pilot. If your voice sucks, you probably won't be a successful singer. So the idea that you can be whatever you want is for many people just not possible.\n\nAnother one are all those over the top positive affirmations they keep teaching kids nowadays. \"I'm the smartest, I'm so beautiful, I'm fantastic\" etc. That's a lot of I's. No wonder many grow up to be self-absorbed, narcissistic assholes. There's a very fine line between teaching your kids to be self confident and to love themselves, and between producing an adult who can't take an ounce of criticism or deal with feedback because they think they're \"perfect just the way they are\".",

Adam Carolla (not my favorite), but I remember hearing him say once, \"I can't stop talking, so I got a job talking.\" And that stuck with me. That guy is yapping away whether he's hanging out in a backyard or he's with strangers or he's making millions of dollars as a tv and podcast personality. And if we us that example to redefine \"bliss\" to really mean \"compulsion,\" I think we end up with people actually identifying what it is that makes them happy. \n\nFor MANY years, I thought writing--journaling, nonfiction, fiction, anything--was my \"bliss.\" But I never enjoyed plot building, never had the interest to complete anything beyond writing for a single session. AND THEN I discovered real DOODLING (Peter Draws on Youtube opened my brain up).  I love mark making. I realized I loved the act of writing, not the content. Making the loops, emptying pens, filling sketchbooks with ink, the weight of the paper, the crispy crinkle of good paper. And THAT is my BLISS. Sometimes I just make marks with a pencil on a page and then take pens to try to make interesting patterns and, unlike writing which often left me depressed, I have never been happier and have been filling pages with ink more than I have in my entire life (I'm 36). \n\nIt's not something I \"chose,\" it's something that intrinsically satisfies me and impulsively happens, and \"following\" it has literally made it so I stop nervously bouncing my leg all the time. \n\nSo, a more true, but less catchy version might be, \"Recognize and cultivate your healthy impulsive behaviors.\"",

Is that,. Easy.\n\nI can't.\nI understand, even someone who has been in the same place, says that, believes that. Reassures understanding, being there.. To help.\nI, myself, have said that, truly believe in that.\n\nCause also is easy to say, when someone else, oneself, has passed, enduring, fixed, got better... Yes.\nThat, maybe Is the primary reason for being so obnoxious to hear - having got over other things, worse or not.\nIsn't easy. Is not easy peachy, just relax, and take a breath, there's always a tomorrow or solution or etc. \n.. Yep. \nI swear i don't plant myself on a negative side, or variations. \nI think allí of you can know, that advice, is asked, when you need something. Being help, company... Not for nothing, and some are received without asking. In good matter... That, is not easy. Isn't imposible (well, some things are, just taking in gral from a tiny problem, to a big deal, etc) \n\n(also the source of laughter, the renowned Law of attraction. Yes. I sometimes, if given moments, cannot resist, keep talking about it with whoever said it, as being trollish? Dunno... To say \"well.

What are we doing? \nLet's buy the most popular, and all people, will be happy and without problem. \nSame with the so called guru's, with methods of being successful, and more. Ok. If they are, most do that and nothing else, they may have problems, but they will have money, from advertising his method, secret, etc. \n\nIt's gonna be OK. Yes. I think I want that. That's why I'm asking for a an advice, help, guidance. \nThing is, now I'm not ok. And until I get close to resolve my situation, i can be thinking that myself in another way,.. Cause if not, why do something at all if, isn't gonna be OK \nThis seems like a rant, even it's not. \nI truly believe, that many of you, have crossed with those words, being friends or a book. \nN if some have reached what they wanted needed, wasn't pure luck. No? \nIf happens to be, you are living a very difficult time, situation.. You hear \"a version of, now you are down, you will be better - like\", can produce a contrary feeling, nothing, but maybe a kick of hope, that is short, and it's best to say yes, you're right.. Or maybe, a feeling of whatever happens to you, gets minimized, rejected, and on. \nYes, you can be better, and that short lapse of hope, take it, and rethink your priorities, plans,.. But that happen along the way, and isn't even necessary, to listen. \nMaybe you did considered already? And got lost, under the circumstances? And get up and keep going.. Isn't that, the most important thing to do? Keep on. \nListening the simplest thing, over a difficult time, could let you feel that you won't be able to go on? Sounds so easy, and for you, there, it is not. \nIt's a consolation. \nTake it, or leave it. If you have fought different battles, you know is not like that. \nWhy couldn't be, something annoying, contrast, even cause of guilt or react strongly, to someone that tried to cheer you up?.. N get angry, or answering badly, rejecting or confronting... \n\nCause yes. You can feel down, see no end, and, it's gonna be OK.tell me how, please, save me the long way of getting there.
