Drunk at the time of the photograph, the sailor is shown kissing an unwilling partner (according to historic preservationist Kafi Benz, among the four frames taken by Eisenstaedt, available through Getty Images, the woman is shown defensively socking the man in the face with the closed fist of her one, free arm).[43] The widely agreed-upon identity of the woman who is a subject in the photograph, dental assistant Greta Zimmer Friedman, had also explicitly stated that the kiss she was subjected to, was not a consensual act, that he just \"grabbed\" her. Combined with bemused expressions on some of the bystanders and the sailor's firm grasp of the nurse, the situation has been described as emblematic of a time when women were \"subordinated to men\", or, that of a rape culture.[42]",

One of the guys spikes the drinks with anti freeze thinking it'll make the girls drunk faster, not realizing it's a poison. Just the girl drinks the spiked stuff. Throughout the night she complains of feeling off and having difficulty with her vision.\n\nOne of the guys convinces her to go to the bedroom with him to take photos. With her on the bed he asks her if she can take her clothes off and do some poses. She doesn't answer and he some how sees it as consent so he strip her down and movers her limbs, taking photos. \n\nHe asks her if she can go nude, but again nothing and again he sees it as consent so he strip her bare and takes some shots. It's not till he is uploading the photos that he finally notices she hadn't been breathing. Don't know much about what happened after but shots of her still pops up now and then and frankly quite sad that jokes are still made at her expense some 10 or so years after her death.",

It’s not the most normal photo, but I was reminded of it when I read the question.\n\nThis is a ransom photo of Samantha Koenig that was meant to prove to her boyfriend that she is still alive. However, at the time this picture was taken, Samantha was already dead.\n\nFrom [the killer’s Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Keyes?wprov=sfti1): Keyes' last known victim was 18-year-old Samantha Koenig, a coffee booth employee in Anchorage, Alaska. Keyes kidnapped Koenig from her workplace on February 1, 2012, took her debit card and other property, sexually assaulted her, then killed her the following day. He left her body in a shed and went to New Orleans, where he departed on a pre-booked two-week cruise with his family in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWhen he returned to Alaska, he removed Koenig's body from the shed, applied makeup to the corpse's face, sewed her eyes open with fishing line, and snapped a picture of a four-day-old issue of the Anchorage Daily News alongside her body, posed to appear that she was still alive. After demanding $30,000 in ransom, Keyes dismembered Koenig's body and disposed of it in Matanuska Lake, north of Anchorage.",

There is nothing remarkable about the photo, except that it might be a strange choice of perspective, but nothing in the photo appears as anything other than mundane, the kind of photo you might take on accident.\n\nIn reality, it was taken at 1:49AM somewhere in the Panama bush by the iPhone of Dutch teenager Kris Kremers, one week almost to the hour that she and her friend Lisanne Froon disappeared from a local hiking trail. It was one of *seventy* photos taken by her iPhone between 1AM and 3AM on April 8th, 2014. The photo is one of the very last things that was chosen to be done with the iPhone before the battery finally ran out. You might think that 70 pictures taken firsthand in the middle of an emergency would be a huge help in figuring out what happened. You would be incredibly wrong. You can find the entirety of the photo set here: https://koudekaas.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-disappearance-of-kris-kremers-and_11.html?m=1\n\nThey're fucking haunting.\n\nThese two women used their phones to try to contact emergency services multiple times on multiple days. They were ostensibly alive for at least a week. They took *hundreds* of pictures during this time frame. The phones were cycled on and off, demonstrating that they were purposefully conserving battery, and at least suggesting that they weren't being held captive.  At no point did they photograph themselves, any injuries, or make any note about the nature of their predicament. The whole thing is uncanny as fuck, and I find it deeply, deeply disturbing.",

GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL!”\n\nChristopher McCandless, also known by his nickname Alexander Supertramp, wanted to go spend a few months out on his own in the wilds of Alaska. The first couple months went fine, but he quickly realized he had been in way over his head. He started to trek back, but he realized the river that had been frozen when he came in, had thawed and was now full of rushing water. He trekked back to continue living in the abandoned bus he had found earlier.\n\nFor 114 days he lived in that bus, slowly losing his strength and his hope for survival. Once he got to the point he accepted he would die, he took that photo with his camera, and laid down in his sleeping bag, waiting to die. His decomposing body was found much later, with two moose hunters finding the bus with an S.O.S. note propped up outside. The saddest part in my opinion, is that if he had just walked a mile or so down the river, he would have found a way designed for people to cross it when it wasn’t frozen. But he did not find it, and instead either starved to death or died from eating something poisonous.",

Whatever made the metal melt was probably very dangerous, but now it's just a blob of metal, no longer any dangerous, right?\n\nSadly, it isn't. That's the molten core of Chernobyls reactor.\n\nAfter the fatal meltdown, the still glowing hot material ate it's way through the ground until it eventually hit the pipes for the reactors cooling water, which it then followed until the pipe burst in the basement, shortly after which the material cooled down enough to settle. \n\nThis thing is the only one of it's kind, and you could say a lot of interresting things about it. But there are other people who can explain that far better than me. What's the messed up part about this picture tho?\n\nWhile these days, the elephants foots radiation has reduced enough that you can spend more than an hour there before the radiation starts affecting you, this picture was taken mere weeks after the meltdown. Where even multiple rooms away, the radiation would still turn lethal within minutes rather than hours. A distance which the photograph of this picture did not have.\n\nThis picture cost a mans life.",

You can't see in the picture, but she was dead. He had killed her and, after taking the picture, violated her body before burying her body in the garden.

It is not provable but plausible that the solar eclipse was one of the omens which led Nineveh to repent (history records that there was also a civil war and plagues).

She is widely believed to have been kidnapped. In July 1989, a Polaroid photo of an unidentified young woman and boy, gagged and seemingly bound, was televised to the public after it was found in a convenience store parking lot in Port St. Joe, Florida. Family friends thought the woman resembled Calico and contacted her mother, who then met with investigators and examined the Polaroid. She believed it was her daughter after taking \"time, growth and lack of makeup\" into consideration, and noted that a scar on the woman's leg was identical to one that Calico had. Scotland Yard analyzed the photo and concluded that the woman was Calico, but a second analysis by the Los Alamos National Laboratory disagreed. An FBI analysis of the photo was inconclusive.\n\n[the photo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/Unidentified_kidnapping_victims_1989.jpg)\n\nThe book is (edit: NOT) [Flowers in the Attic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers_in_the_Attic)\n\nBut another book by the same author.

The shower photo is admittedly a really good quality posed thing; Arias wasn’t a half bad photographer, but what happened after makes the photo really haunting.",

Her eyes tell a crazy story, but then you realize what was fabricated was actually disgusting. McCurry is a famous Nat Geo photojournalist has been criticized of photoshopping and doctoring his journalism (a big no no in photojournalism, in things like World Press, even changing exposure is means for disqualification)\n\nA 2019 article in the Indian magazine [The Wire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire_(India\\)) that described a 2002 interview with Sharbat Gula says that she was angered by the photograph being taken and published without her consent. The writer for The Wire suggests that this is because \"it is not welcome for a girl of traditional Pashtun culture to reveal her face, share space, make eye contact and be photographed by a man who does not belong to her family.\"\n\nEssentially the way this was framed was this girl was scared from her war torn experience. But McCurry had ventured into a refugee camp where she was enjoying herself, he came in and asked the teacher if he could photograph her because he had seen her eyes (her face would've been covered up.) In reference to the above quote, being in the presence of a man, making contact with him etc, is all not allowed (but was allowed because he was a white man.)\n\n[It basically ruined her life and became a larger story in South Asia.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/pages/article/afghan-girl-home-afghanistan) Luckily she was given residence and an allowance to live/pay for things, but man... so much deception in photo journalism that we don't even know about.\n\n[Tony Northrup gives a great detailed experience for most photographers who have been shocked and in awe of this photograph. And the proceeding reaction afterwards.](https://youtu.be/RuFKpaV_jjo)\n\nEdit: \n\nIn 1984, McCurry was based in Pakistan, employed as a photojournalist for National Geographic during the early years of the Soviet war in neighbouring Afghanistan. On one shoot, McCurry stepped into an *all-girls Islamic religious school*. There he took the photo of an eight-year-old student named Sharbat Gula.\n\nIn the photograph, Sharbat Gula has piercing green eyes. Wrapped in a tattered maroon shawl, she fixes her gaze at the camera – meeting eyes eventually with millions of people once the picture went on National Geographic‘s June 1985 cover.\n\nThe photograph also made McCurry’s career, earning him fame and recognition, and became one of the most globally recognisable photographic portraits ever taken.\n\nFor readers in the West, it was a symbol of Afghanistan – still an anonymous, distant location – or else of refugees in crisis. Yet the story inside the magazine said not a word about Sharbat Gula. Her photo was captioned, “Haunted eyes tell of an Afghan refugee’s fears”, but as Northrup reveals, the fear in those eyes was most likely the fear of Steve McCurry. \n\nJust to throw some shade at National Geographic, \"The 2002 story describes Sharbat Gula as an orphan whose parents were killed in a bombing in Afghanistan, which turned out to be false. She has said that her mother died of appendicitis and that her father was alive when they moved to Pakistan.\"",

Their mission was to establish a campsite in the mountains.\n\nThis is the last photo where the group is seen alive. All of them died persumably died on the night of the 1-2 Febuary.  After their bodies were found in the investigation it was said that 6 of them died because of hypothermia and the other three because of physical trauma of which some included skull cracks, missing tongue and eyebrows. The others who died of hypothermia were not dressed for the cold, cut their tents open and fled the campsite. This incident was very bizzare for many reasons and the Soviet authorities had no clear explanation for what had happened.\n\nOnly in 2020 Russian authorities concluded the case.  It it is said that the incident happened because of a slab avalanche -one of the most dangerous types of avalanches.  The survivors of the avalanche had been forced to suddently flee the campsite with low visibility and poor clothing for the cold which led to them dying of hypothermia. A study in 2021 by an University in Zurich also said that an slab avalanche explains their injuries.\n\nThe site where they died was named after the group leader the \"Dyatlov Pass\" and the incident is known as the \"Dyatlov Pass Incident\".",

The next morning an aerial search of the forest was conducted, as well as a foot search of the village and the lightly wooded areas by locals.\n\nBy April 6, the two women were still missing. Fearing the worst, the Kremers and Froon families flew to Panama, bringing with them detectives from the Netherlands. Along with local police and dog units, they searched the forests for ten days.\r  \n\r  \nDays turned into weeks, and after ten weeks there had still not been any sign of Kremers or Froon.\n\nThen, as police were slowing their search efforts, a local woman turned in a blue backpack, claiming to have found it in a rice paddy along the banks of the river. Inside the backpack were two pairs of sunglasses, $83 in cash, Froon’s passport, a water bottle, and two bras.\n\nAlso inside, most importantly, was Froon’s camera and both of the women’s cell phones.\n\nPolice immediately investigated the camera and phones and came up with disturbing evidence.\r  \n\r  \nThe phones had remained in service for almost ten days after the women disappeared. Over just four days, 77 separate attempts had been made to call the police, both via 112, the emergency number in the Netherlands, and 911, the emergency number in Panama. Using the call logs, police were able to come up with an outline of the time the girls spent missing in the forests.\r  \n\r  \nThe first two emergency calls had been just hours after Kremers and Froon had begun their hike to the 112 emergency number. Due to the dense jungle, neither of the attempts went through.\n\nIn fact, out of all 77 calls, only one managed to make contact but broke up after just two seconds.\n\nPolice also discovered that on April 6, several unsuccessful attempts were made to unlock Kremers’ phone with an incorrect PIN number. It never received the correct number again. By April 11, both phones were dead.\n\nThough the call log was disturbing, it was nothing compared to the camera.\r  \n\r  \nThe first photos on the camera were taken the morning of April 1 when the women had left for their hike. The photos showed them on a trail near the Continental Divide, though nothing about them led police to become suspicious.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, the second set of photos was worrisome. Taken in the dead of night, between the hours of 1 and 4 AM on April 8, the photos showed the girls belongings spread out on rocks, plastic bags and candy wrappers, oddly piled mounds of dirt, a mirror, and — most worrisome — the back of Kremers’ head with blood leaking from her temple.\n\n[Here you can see all the photos taken by them](https://koudekaas.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-disappearance-of-kris-kremers-and_11.html)",

By all we know now, she was curious, intelligent, and eager to learn...her brain had just literally missed the window to learn language.\n\nShe's, on this picture, desperately trying to learn to communicate, but she never gained full language.\n\nAlso, she sort of ended up cast aside by the researchers who used het as a guinea pig. If alive, she's in a assisted living facility somewhere.\n\nEdit: Several people commented on the \"cast aside and used as a guinea pig\" part. While SOME researchers, such as Curtiss, seemed to genuinely have cared for Genie, there definitely are signs that NOT all of them had equally noble motives. I did research this a while back, and different articles focus  on different people.\n\nThis article: https://www.verywellmind.com/genie-the-story-of-the-wild-child-2795241 paints a somewhat different picture than the Guardian one.\n\n\"Psychiatrist Jay Shurley helped assess Genie after she was first discovered, and he noted that since situations like hers were so rare, she quickly became the center of a battle between the researchers involved in her case. Arguments over the research and the course of her treatment soon erupted. Genie occasionally spent the night at the home of Jean Butler, one of her teachers.\n\nAfter an outbreak of measles, Genie was quarantined at her teacher's home. Butler soon became protective and began restricting access to Genie. Other members of the team felt that Butler's goal was to become famous from the case, at one point claiming that Butler had called herself the next Anne Sullivan, the teacher famous for helping Helen Keller learn to communicate.\n\nEventually, Genie was removed from Butler's care and went to live in the home of psychologist David Rigler, where she remained for the next four years. Despite some difficulties, she appeared to do well in the Rigler household. She enjoyed listening to classical music on the piano and loved to draw, often finding it easier to communicate through drawing than through other methods.\n\nNIMH withdrew funding in 1974, due to the lack of scientific findings. Linguist Susan Curtiss had found that while Genie could use words, she could not produce grammar. She could not arrange these words in a meaningful way, supporting the idea of a critical period in language development.\n\nRigler's research was disorganized and largely anecdotal. Without funds to continue the research and care for Genie, she was moved from the Rigler's care.\"\n\nAt the very least, not all of their motives were so pure, and this kid was failed on several levels.",

Meanwhile they have no idea that their space shuttle is irreparably damaged, and in fact will be dead in a few days during reentry (which was considered “safe” until then). \n\nIt’s the crew for *Columbia* for those who don’t know, whose tiles were damaged during the launch of the shuttle into space by foam. No one knew how bad the damage was until it disintegrated.\n\nEdit: some are disagreeing with my final sentence because there were some engineers concerned about the foam during launch who thought additional photographs should be taken to confirm any damage or lack thereof, which were not in fact taken.  I'm still standing by my statement because while this was definitely a flaw that NASA management downplayed any potential risks, there's no evidence that anyone *knew* the thing was gonna burn up on reentry or that this was a potential mode of failure, and it's more like \"they should have had methods in place to see this was a serious potential risk.\"  More info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster#Flight_risk_management).\n\nEven if they had, there are serious questions as to whether the crew could have been saved, because real life is not a Hollywood film.

There was another ship about 10 miles behind the SS Edmund Fitzgerald called the SS Arthur M. Anderson. The Fitzgerald contacted the Arthur M. Anderson saying that their radars were down and asked the Arthur M. Anderson to inform them of anything on their radars. At about 3:00pm the captain of the Fitzgerald, Captain Ernest M. McSorley, told the Arthur M. Anderson the Fitzgerald started to list to the starboard side and that one of their fence rails were down and 2 vent covers were missing. At about 4:00 the Fitzgerald contacted the Anderson telling them that their radars were down. And asked the Anderson to give them position updates. At 6:40pm the Anderson was hit by 2 huge waves ~35ft. waves in quick succession. At 7:10 the Anderson contacted the Fitzgerald asking how they were doing and Captain Ernest M. McSorley told them \"We are holding out own\". Shortly after that transmission the Fitzgerald disappeared off the Anderson's radar. The Anderson contacted the Coast Guard after they made to safety and was asked to go back out and look for survivers but all they found was debris and a life raft with no one in it. The Fitzgerald was found 4 days later at the bottom of Lake Superior. No bodies were recovered. \n\nThere was also a song written about the event by Gordon Lightfoot called \"The Wreck of The Edmund Fitzgerald\"",

The senior class was practicing for graduation (where to walk, where to sit, how to come to the stage for their diploma, etc) in the gym, so our gym teacher just had us sit on the bleachers and watch them/chat. Basically a free period. I got bored, so I filmed some of the seniors rehearsing, including this one guy who I'd known pretty much all my life. He was the definition of a \"gentle giant\". Tall as hell and built like a linebacker, but very kind and would always protect people he saw being bullied. All around great guy. \n\nTwo days later, during senior skip day (senior class skipped school and met up at a nearby park for a big picnic/last hurrah together; local tradition), a group of the senior boys decided to hop into two separate cars for a race. I live in the mountains of West Virginia, and mountainous, curvy as hell, poorly maintained roads are not safe even at the best of times, but while speeding? Dangerous as fuck.\n\nThe two cars reach a set of train tracks and a train is coming. One car makes it across before the train, but the other has to wait for it to pass. It does, and they hurry up catch up with the first car. And then they see it. \n\nThe first car had taken a curve too quickly and went sliding over a hill before wrapping around a tree. The driver lost an arm and a leg, one of the passengers suffered severe brain trauma and was left... just about the closest to a vegetable you can be without actually being one, and the other... the other was our gentle giant. He didn't make it.\n\nDid I mention that the twin of the brain damaged boy was in the second car and was the one who found them? Did I mention that our gentle giant came from an abusive home, so his grandmother had taken him in and raised him, and he had learning difficulties and she just wanted to see him graduate high school and he died mere days before graduation? They buried him in his cap and gown.\n\nAs far as I know, I have the last footage of him alive, somewhere on a tape. I have the last footage of the twin before his life changed forever. The last of the driver with all his limbs.\n\nI still think of him and cry, wishing he'd gotten to graduate, knowing his grandmother was so proud of him, knowing that he was one of the kindest, gentlest men I've ever known, despite coming from a background of so much pain. Knowing that it could've made him angry, made him the bully, and instead it just made him determined to never let anyone go through what he did. \n\nAnyway. I only rewatched that video once. I couldn't bear to look at it again.",

During an open ocean dive that was far too advanced for her limited experience, Tina experienced an equipment malfunction and drowned.  \n\nHer husband Gabe is, at best, an arrogant, incompetent, lying piece of shit who exaggerated his abilities as a certified rescue diver and was unable to save his wife when she began exhibiting signs of distress; at worst, he’s a cold-blooded murderer who deliberately shut off her air supply until she passed out and then allowed her to drown. He gave sixteen differing accounts of the incident, which occurred shortly after he requested that Tina make him her sole life insurance beneficiary (on the advice of her father, Tina didn’t change her policy, but she told Gabe that she had).\n\nAfter being charged with Tina’s murder, Gabe pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison; his sentence was suspended after only eighteen months.

The core was involved in 2 criticality accidents. \nIn the first accident, Henry Daghlian accidentally dropped a tungsten carbide brick onto the core and caused it to go into supercriticality, exposing him to a lethal dose of radiation that killed him 25 days later.\nIn the second accident, the scientists ignored protocols and used a screwdriver instead of shims to prevent the 2 beryllium spheres surrounding the core that were used in the experiment. If these 2 spheres closed completely, the core would have gone supercritical. One day, while performing this experiment, Louis Slotin was demonstrating this technique to his peers before leaving Los Alamos. His screwdriver slipped a fraction of an inch, and the spheres completely sealed the core, causing it to go supercritical. A burst of neutron radiation was released for an estimated half a second. Slotin ended up dead 9 days later and his peer survived but died 20 years later due to a heart attack.\n\nI had to leave out a lot of details to keep this short but there is more info here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core",

He and his siblings were abused and later killed by their parents by driving into the cliff four years later after this pic is taken. His body is still missing.\n\nSource: https://www.glamour.com/story/hart-family-tragedy-jen-and-sarah-hart-case\n\nhttps://amp.observers.france24.com/en/20200603-usa-viral-photo-resurfaces-devonte-hart-racial-abuse",
