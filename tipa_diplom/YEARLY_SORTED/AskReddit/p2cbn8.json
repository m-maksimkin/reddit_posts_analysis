That reason is that it is garbage. It's poor quality, it took huge resources to ship it here across the ocean, it's designed to be disposable and end up floating around the ocean with the rest of the garbage in a hurry.\n\nEdit: I'm not judging people who have to shop there out of economic necessity. They are victims of a system that's crooked. I like what Terry Pratchett said: \"The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.\n\nTake boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.\n\nBut the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\n\nThis was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.\"",

            "text": "Basically all shoes.  Almost every pair of shoes you've ever seen from Nike, Adidas, etc are actively damaging our bodies and causing pain. This stems from the elevated heels and tight toe boxes.  What we should be wearing are barefoot shoes (actually we should just be walking barefoot, but I digress), which have zero-drop (no change in elevation from heel to toe), thin soles allowing your feet to better feel the ground, and wide toe boxes, allowing your toes to spread and actually help in walking like they're supposed to. \n\n\nMost normal shoes have elevated heels, which teach you a heavy heel-toe step, which isn't terrible for walking, but causes just about all running injuries, as we should naturally run on our toes.  Additionally it shortens our Achilles tendons, which then can't handle the stress of running or jumping (this is why Basketball players get injured so much in the Achilles, or why box jumps can cause so much harm).  The tight toe boxes compress our toes, damaging them.  It also renders them useless in most activities, which is really a bummer as they work quite well.  \n\nBarefoot shoes were and are unfortunately marketed primarily as running shoes, which is the exact opposite of what we should be doing.  If you walk in standard shoes with elevated heels, but run in barefoot shoes you're almost guaranteed to injure yourself, again because of the shortened Achilles.  The best thing to do is walk primarily in barefoot shoes, then add barefoot running shoes. \n\nGood barefoot shoe brands to get are vivobarefoot or xero, though there are tons.  Personally I just got some Whitin shoes, they're only on Amazon and like $50, so totally worth it.",

            "text": "Apple products. Pretty much any of them. I’m sure I’ll catch some hate for this but it’s true. \n\nApple products are generally always at least a year or two behind in hardware vs competing brands’ new devices, but always more expensive.  A lot of times they are twice the price. \n\nWith an apple product you get a device that you cannot do anything with that apple doesn’t want you to, even though you’ve purchased it and it is YOURS. Even repairs, you can’t fix your own apple device(with genuine parts). You have to take it to an apple certified repair store. If that’s not bad enough, apple threatens to sue any store that repairs apple products that isn’t certified by apple, in order to scare them out of repairing apple products. You cannot buy parts for your devices from apple, only Chinese copies. Even the apple certified repair stores aren’t even allowed to carry parts on hand, they have to order them from apple and get them shipped. \n\nTheir motto has always been NO compatibility. It’s basically a greed tactic. For example, they would just make a new kind of cable and call it the new standard so no ones old cords worked even from their old apple devices. Really fucked up. Creates a ton of useless cables in landfills. And when governments say apple might have to ditch their proprietary cords for a standard like usb c they tried to say it would create too much waste as one of their arguments …. Lol\n\n\nAnd I’m not saying all this as an apple hater who’s never used apple products. I have used them plenty, in fact I wanted to try out a new iPhone and the iPhone SE was actually much less of a rip off than most other apple shit I’ve seen so I got it. I’m typing this post on it right now. Is it a good phone? Sure it’s not bad, but it’s absolutely not any more special than any android phone, and the hardware is slower than an android from the same time. If it breaks and I want to get it fixed with genuine parts, I can’t do it myself because apple won’t sell me parts. They will tell me I have to just buy a new phone. That’s literally what they do. It’s so fucked up. \n\nPretty much all of this started with Steve Jobs. “No compatibility“ was literally his motto. It blows my mind how many ppl think he was a good dude. He was a piece of shit person, treated his employees like dirt, he was not a computer builder/programmer. He was a salesman. Steve Wozniak built all of the computers that apple got their start with (but he wouldn’t have mentioned that). Steve Jobs was kind of a fuckin whack job. Owning a large percentage of apple and being a literal billionaire, he NEVER ONCE DONATED ANY MONEY TO ANY CHARITY, LIKE EVER!!!!! Then he got sick and refused any modern proven cancer treatment, he believed some dumbass alternative wholistic healing methods would cure his cancer, and then he fucking died from it!

The OS has become very slow compared to its first release, runs like hell on older hardware, and can be unnecessarily complicated. \n\nI think that Windows 11 will start to change a lot of minds.

Douching for one isn't necessary as a healthy woman's vagina is pretty much self-cleaning making such products unnecessary. Douching also puts women at risk of all sorts of things such as bacterial vaginosis, UTIs, and yeast infections. If she already happens to have one of these it can push the bacteria causing the infection further up into the fallopian tubes, uterus, and ovaries. It's a useless and dangerous product that has probably caused countless infections yet still sells by the million in developed countries because there seems to be no one saying that a product tied to so many health concerns should be banned. I personally think they should be banned due to the harm they cause. I however realise that this argument could be used to ban all sorts of the things like cigarettes, alcohol, junk food yada yada and that isn't going to happen. I do however, think that perhaps this is different because those things aren't targeting one specific group especially with the idea that a woman's vagina is automatically disgusting, foul, smelly etc and needs fixing (a foul odour is a sign of an infection not a need for douching). One group (women) specifically are targeted here not society in general so perhaps that makes it different.",

I appreciate anybody who makes the effort to caring for a dog like family. My issue is with pug breeders.\n\nThey're not a naturally evolved dog breed, they were selectively bred to have flatter faces and bigger eyes over the last few centuries. What resulted is an animal that not only couldn't survive in the wild, but an animal that cannot survive without humans' modern medical intervention. Pugs suffer from [a myriad of significant health complications](https://vethelpdirect.com/vetblog/2021/03/17/do-pugs-have-health-problems-things-to-know-before-you-buy/#h-there-are-breeders-and-pug-enthusiasts-who-are-working-hard-to-improve-pug-health) their entire life, they really struggle just to exist, and it's pretty sad to think millions of these animals were born into these deliberately manufactured genes because they look so cute.\n\nAgain, if you own a pug, no judgement. Obviously. I'm not going to be a dick and shame people for loving their pug. Quite the opposite. I'm certain they put a ton of effort and money into giving that little love muffin the best possible life, like any member of the family, and I hugely respect them for doing so. But when that sweet angel fulfills its life and gets its wings back, I would recommend a bit of pause before the replacement pug.\n\nYou could just try a different toy breed, not only to reduce the demand for more pug breeding but just for the variety in dog owning experience. You can get a pug cross-breed, which would reduce the amount of health complications they have. Or, you could do some in-depth research and become a part of a pug breeding rehabilitation initiative, which is a growing association of pug breeders trying to genetically undo the health complications that have arisen over the last couple centuries.\n\nEdit:  \nPeople seem to be misreading this post (getting very irrationally triggered), and thinking this is some kind of competition for \"which dog breed is the most unhealthy overall.\" I did not single out the pug because I believe they suffer the worst from medical problems (they do not). I chose the pug because of the breed's shockingly rapid decline over just a couple centuries, all for the purpose of visual appeal to human owners. The pug was an otherwise healthy and capable breed not too long ago, one that has existed alongside humans for several millennia. What breeders have done to them in such a sickeningly short timespan is abhorrently cruel, and with this information in mind, I plead prospective dog owners to make alternative considerations to reduce the current breed's market demand, and increase demand for healthier cross-breeds or healthy rehabilitating breeding efforts.\n\nI also recognize that the pug isn't the only dog breed to have been detrimentally genetically modified for human aesthetic appeal. The French bulldog is also a victim of such terrible breeding practices, and my feelings towards their breeders and owners is the same. The reason why I chose the pug over the French bulldog is because, in the interest of an AskReddit thread, they asked for just a single product, and the answer would carry less impact if I wrote a generic \"designer dog breeds\" answer (leaving a lot more room for semantic nonsense). I also feel people identify more strongly with pugs than French bulldogs, because pugs are more distinct and iconic in culture.",

They’re like Amazon, a few clicks and a puppy will be sent to your door, and these puppies are coming from the exact same place as the pet store puppies.

They are the best cash crop you could hope for.\n\nNever believe a store who claims they only sell puppies from responsible breeders. No, not even if the owner has visited the breeders and “know” they’re good! By definition a responsible breeder would NEVER send their puppies to a pet store. Even pet stores that claim to only have rescues need to be scrutinized because some mills will use a shell rescue to [“puppy launder”](https://caninechronicle.com/current-articles/puppy-laundering-the-unsavory-big-business-of-rescue-for-profit/). “Licensed and certified breeders” should be a red flag - depending on the state, a breeder only needs to be licensed if they have a large number of dogs, are selling to brokers to go to pet stores, or to people “sight unseen” (online). YMMV depending on the state.\n\nPeople sometimes justify their purchases as “saving” puppies from a pet store. But that is still investing in the industry and funding their operations by giving them profit. Legislation hasn’t stemmed the tide. Only a loss of profit will make mills move on to another hustle.\n\nSo please educate yourself and anyone you know who loves dogs and might ever be tempted to purchase a puppy from a pet store or online.

            "text": "Apple stuff...Somone made the mistake of asking me why I hate Apple.  I'll be brief...\n\nThere are only a few cults that are a threat to the world as we know it and Apple is one of them.  They are changing the world with their practices and it's  not for the better.  I spent a few months computer shopping this summer and that has blent into back to school and I've seen enough and need to rant.  You wont see most PC computer ads unless you are looking for them.  If you do see something its typically a picture of a computer and a spec sheet and a price tag. Done. That's it.  But Apple has so many beautiful people being cooler than you as their silhouette dances with prizmatic images of a phone that they just made a full length feature film with.  Or somebody bringing water to a remote African village using nothing but his I-pad and a stupid hat.  That's not what computers are for and that's not what they're doing and that's not who is using them.\n\nThere is a special place in hell for those that want to sell a child a fifty dollar t-shirt just so he can tease the kids in a five dollar t-shirt. Agreed?  Well it's the computer version of that.  A real computer should not look like a sports car.  It should be about as pretty as a 600° cinder block with sparks spitting out the back and a fan that doubles as a helicopter rotor.  Pretty people don't use computers or any modern alternative of them for anything beyond Instagram updates at the beach.  Systems are not sexy.  And we, the pale faced basement dwellers full of hot pockets and Mt. Dew trying to respec our main's DPS, are not sexy either.  Quit trying.\n \nI know Apple isn't the only company out there with huge mark up selling glitz and glamour vs. meat and potatoes.  For example  Ferrari could probably make a more affordable car if they put their minds to it.  But Ferrari isn't marketing almost exclusively to young and often broke college students with the intention of being an industry leader instead of a niche market.  It's a terrible practice and you've been in that practice ever since you were throwing sledgehammers at giant tv screens during the Superbowl.   (By the way, that commercial single handedly drove up prices on their unreleased system by 20%.  Nothing more caused that last minute price hike than an ad.  Every person that bought the first Macintosh paid like $300 more just because of an ad.)\n\nYou're a leader with bad practices and setting bad examples for others to follow.  Your business practices go way beyond Asian sweatshops and are more like a cult trying to feed the electronics world poison Kool-Aid.  \nI've been in the game long enough to get flexed on by your muscle.  I grew up under the myth that you started that said if you wanted to be a graphic artist you had to own a Mac. Absolute fiction.  You even tried to hire me to be muscle.  Before the pandemic a third party company asked me to visit retailers on your behalf to make sure your product was displayed in a fashion that kept people from seeing comparable products from major manufacturers that were half the price.  \n\nThat's not the first time I refused to work for you.  In my days in computer sales I consistently pushed people away from your product because I was suspicious of your claims and I was right to be.  I was told to sell the computers we later found out you were lying about.  Processor speed and performance simply weren't what you said they were.  It wasn't  hard to see through the \"even though its slower its actually faster\" lie and you started selling Pentium systems once the story broke.  And now you're back to your own processors again and you better believe the world is watching.\n\nStop deliberately over charging kids and creating feelings of inadequacy over something as nerdy as home office electronics.  Stop squeezing on people and publications that out you like your the tech world version of scientology. If you want to sell Ferraris then don't do it at Walmart.  In fact don't sell another proprietary, overpriced, deliberately withheld and under manufactured product or accessory until you can answer me this.  If your competitors are ripping you off by making the exact same product you did, then how are they doing it at a third of the price to consumers?\n\nPS- this is coming to you live from a Samsung 8.  It's a bit of a dinosaur but I continue to use it without issue because the manufacturer's updates DON'T DELIBERATELY SLOW MY PHONE DOWN SO I'M FORCED TO BUY A NEW MODEL EVERY SIX WEEKS!!!",

            "text": "I'm guessing the \"My Pillow\". Its an overpriced, poorly made, mass produced and marketed ( which im sure is where the budget for this product goes to. Im betting like 80%/20% in terms of marketing and then production costs.\n\nNot only is it just a pillow, and im not super well versed or well educated on the design/engineering/etc of pillow \"technology\". Im sure there is a good/better/best in terms of form/fit/function. Im also guessing shape, give, softness,firmness,design,ability to transfer heat away, actual therapeutic ( if there is such a thing designed or incorporated into a pillow ), cervical, neck pain, side sleepers, back sleepers, crazy flip flop dip fantasia sleepers that take the whole bed ( most gfs/wifes/dogs ) etc. \n\nAgain, im sure there is a good/better/best pillow that has qualities that far exceed many other pillows in the pillow-verse that are by far and away ( and most likely not a huge far and away distance from those that are lesser pillows ) pillows that serve and work in a the purpose for which they are designed. One that comes to mind is a bean shaped pillow made and designed for pregnant women. My wife had one and swore by it as it was shaped so it would alleviate tummy strain, let it curve in between her legs so she could rest one on top of the pillow, and lots of other things it was designed and made for, and worked. And it was like around 50 bucks i think.\n\nAnyways back to the subject, the \"My Pillow\" is just a mass produced, insanely marketed ( and this is why it sells and where they make the profits as its really just a pillow. Its marketed and has a price point and im betting a \"weight\" that makes you think that its a great pillow, tons of reviews, feels heavy so gives a sense of quality, and much much more.\n\nTurns out that the CEO/Owner/\"Inventor\" of this pillow is a sack of shit, a trump support, and literally gives trump his bank account information and has pledged his allegiance and support for one of the worst people, candidates, presidents, and whatever other names and titles hes had over the years. He along with the rest of the trump cult is a piece of shit who sells product, simply a bag stuffed with filling we know as a pillow. Ads everywhere, product everywhere from walmart to bed bath and beyond ( i think they actually removed this item from their stores due to the guy being a piece of shit ) and i could go on and on and on, and without a doubt im sure ill get DM's and downvotes and whatever else proclaiming their love for this pillow and ceo of his pillow enterprise. \n\nHe basically took something that everyone has several of, and exploited it in terms of people believing ( and its partly true ) that anything you spend a lot of your life on ( tires, shows, beds ) you should spend a good amount of money on to ensure that the time spent using the product ( which in the realm of the things i listed ) is a great deal of time.\n\nIts nothing new, nothing fancy, nothing that is groundbreaking in design or functionality, use, materials, etc. It wasn't designed at spaceX ( which im betting could make a far better pillow ) and ultimately its success is due to a marketing blitz and being available everywhere, for an insane price. Just a quick look and a standard size ( smallish ) starts at like 25 bucks, and then the bigger you get, you get close to $100. FOR A PILLOW. \n\nA cotton bag stuffed with chopped up foam. Thats all it is. And the ceo is worth somewhere upwards of $300 million bucks.\n\nAnd another quick look shows that at some point, maybe even today, they spend $1.5 million bucks a *week* on commercials and ads ( this was 2018 ) and i see he even wrote a book. I wouldn't be surprised if it was called \"How to be the greatest pillow hustler in the world\".\n\nIf anything, the guy took an idea and made it into an enterprise and amassed a fortune selling it. So i have to give him that. It just sucks because not only is he a horrible human being, but he sells a product to people that isnt groundbreaking or life changing. \n\nThe only thing it does is short you from anywhere of $20 bucks upwards of $100. And if you buy into it and continue to buy products from this brand, like mattress toppers etc, can continue to milk $100s of dollars from your bank account when a few normal, decently priced, or even moderately priced if you spend some cash on like a tempurpedic pillow which would most likely for dollar to dollar be a better purchase ( and hell i might even be buying into that since im no pillow expert ).\n\nSo yeah, the My Pillow is just as bad as any MLM or mass produced overpriced overvalued garbage product sold to you buy a garbage human being. There are tons of terrible products that sell millions, but to me, this is one of the top ones that fleece millions of people out of money they could spend on quality products that are far cheaper and work just as well if not better.\n\nSorry for the rant, but the \"my pillow\" that is one of many answers to the question posed by the OP.",

It's even worse that I want to pay more for something decent but can't find any, because everyone has this lust for dirt cheap shit. It's like everything out there is dollar store quality but with walmart prices. Like, I've been trying to find a good trowl, we have this solid metal one my wife's had since forever that is a beast, I've gone through 4 since then beacuse they're all shitty welded junk that bends or snaps off at the slightest bit of effort. Try to buy decent screws at home depot, it's all this \"everbilt\" shit that strips from hand tightening, funny enough everbilt is owned by home depot. Online shopping has made it worse because you can't even see what you're buying. Marketplaces make this even worse. Tried to buy a tree skirt off amazon a few christmases ago, found one half decent looking one on amazon, it arrives and it's this thin shitty material covered in glitter. Pretty much what you would expect from the dollar store but it was like $8 or something. Though I will admit, it is possible to find good tree skirts, because home goods is one of those markets where there are high end versions, usually way overpriced for what you get.\n\nIt's just a problem that's plagued me for pretty much my adult life. This stuff can be made a lot better but corporations have a race to the bottom for the sake of profits and people want cheap, disposable shit over things that will last. And it's becoming a feedback loop with factories making their own versions and selling direct, which is fine to reduce costs but it's usually at the expense of quality control. It's not any specific terrible product, it's most products.",

I would say maybe but more importantly it is planned obsolescence.  It and should be illegal.  Instead of manufacturing products that last decades, products are manufactured to last months.  It is obscene.  Middle class people are poor because all of their disposable income is eaten up in products that don’t last.  There is no reason your dishwasher shouldn’t last 25 years or more, your printer, your shoes.  I hate bashing all corporations but every one that does it is evil.  Instead of making something that will last a very long time allowing for the middle class to enjoy their wealth stuff is made to fall apart quickly, it’s engineered to fail, So that you can be sold another product.  It’s disgusting and it parasitic.  Someone makes the decision that instead of a part lasting forever, we will make it out of something that may even be slightly more expensive, but will fail after the appropriate time.  \n\nPeople complain about global warming, it is a problem but many disagree about how to address.\n\nPeople complain about the rich.\n\nWhat everyone should be complaining about is planned obsolescence.  It is a disgusting practice sucking the wealth out of the poor and middle class.  It probably costs every family in the country 5-15000 a year or more.  I hate it.",

Boat lifts are filled with stupid shit that can go wrong.  Everything from giant bolts that will gash your boat from lifting it too high, to narrow mouths in the lift.  There should be a wider-mouth that should funnel your boat in, and they should be soft.  NOTHING IS SOFT.  All piers should have rounded corners, not sharp corners that gash your shit.  It's like all this stuff is made by people who have never seen or operated a boat.  If you've gotten a boat with an electric bimini, it's made like shit.  I've had Hot Wheels cars that sound like they have better motors than those.   The corners of most pontoons are this cheap-ass, weak, easily dented and scratched aluminum.  \n\nI'm aware you can go out and buy stuff that limits your odds of shitty things like this from happening, but so much could be done at the point of production that would help from dumbass damage from just brushing up against something.",

I worked at a smaller retail chain out of high school that sold a bunch of \"as seen on tv\" garbage and the pocket hose sold like hotcakes when we first got them. Almost all of them were returned the same week. Hundreds of them. Apparently every thing leaked from the valve attachments to the actual length of the hose. We would constantly have a 10+ person line at the return desk for just pocket hoses. And yet I still see them sold all over the place as popular as ever. I remember mentioning it to one lady as she was checking out and she said she actually bought one and kept it because if she laid it across the length of her flower bed she could water the whole thing at once just by turning on the valve.",

You really, really don't get that much for your hard-earned real dollar.\n\nStill, HEHEHE SHARK CARDS GO BRRRR.",

I particularly remember these plastic bags of like.. six or eight lipsticks each with a small mirror attached to the side of the tube.

I've been turned off to the lavender scented things for life.\n\nEasiest thing to package was coins and cds. Everyone loved those. Worst was frying pans and glass pitchers.

No one teaches them how to eat and how to resistance train. I will help anyone for free I’m no expert, but it’s a hobby that I’m passionate about. It’s a shame that it’s not taught in school, these kids never have a chance.",

Unless you plan on wearing it all the time that $40 shirt isn’t worth it.

I lost my Faze Rug shirt maybe 6 months after getting it, and I haven’t seen it since. I personally justify my hoodies as I’m a massive hoodie collector (15 excluding the 25 mil hoodie which hasn’t shipped), and I wear hoodies all the time.

Three cuing, the idea that we use visual, structure, and meaning cues to read and that most kids will infer the phonics and phonological awareness skills they need, is a very old idea and every single study ever done on 3 cuing has shown that the only people who actually read in the method it proposed are adult unremidiated dyslexic readers.  Teaching this way does nothing to help reading and can in some ways even be harmful yet marketing has made these programs crazy common in US public schools.   If you want to know why young adults today are horrific spellers, writers, and often readers,  this is among the largest reasons why.\n\nhttps://www.apmreports.org/episode/2019/08/22/whats-wrong-how-schools-teach-reading",

            "text": "Hybrid cars have long been touted as the most promising sustainable lifestyle choice since recycling. It’s not hard to see why – hybrid electric vehicles use substantially less fossil fuel than your traditional automobile, and produce far fewer greenhouse gases all around. These are undoubtedly positive things – but while hybrid glorification isn’t completely off base, there’s a little more to it than most consumers may realize.One major issue with the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is the type of battery it requires. Lead acid batteries are critical to a hybrid’s functionality; they allow for regenerative braking, the process that gives these vehicles the ability to save their own energy to power the vehicle when idling or driving at low speeds. Electric motor batteries are typically made from nickel and lithium, which contain high levels of toxicity, and can seriously harm the environment when disposed of improperly.Consider the Toyota Prius, the most popular car of its kind. The National Center for Policy Analysis considers the Prius to be a source for some of the worst pollution in North America. According to their report, “the nickel contained in Prius’ battery is mined and smelted at a plant in Ontario that has caused so much environmental damage to the surrounding environment that NASA has used the ‘dead zone’ around the plant to test moon rovers.”  \nEven so, ultimate disposal hasn’t actually proven to be a big issue yet – after all, most of the 2 million hybrid vehicles on the road in the United States haven’t been around long enough to cause meaningful problems. After sustained usage, however, the lead plates within these batteries will weaken and no longer be capable of storing energy. When the time comes, a safe and proper disposal method for these batteries will be an important task.  \nThankfully, a great solution for this particular hazardous waste product already exists; lead acid batteries can be recycled. This is a very effective process when done properly, and leads to a reduction in both lead pollution and the need for mining virgin materials. This report, entitled “Remanufacturing, Repurposing, and Recycling Post-Vehicle-Application Lithium-Ion Batteries”, suggests that reusing the batteries (perhaps for energy storage at a wind or solar plant) or preparing them for re-use in other vehicles will ultimately help create a booming commercial recycling and reuse industry.  \nWhen done improperly, however, lead acid battery recycling can result in high levels of toxic exposure for those directly involved as well as neighboring communities.  \nHybrids might be imperfect, but raising awareness about lead acid batteries and the importance of safe and proper disposal can make a big difference. And in the end, the consensus still seems to be that hybrids, despite a few drawbacks, remain a solidly “green” choice for your next car.",

I remember one time when I was waiting for my train with a friend, it was cold outside so we stayed inside the station, outside of the cigarettes vendor. A guy was attached to the slot machine the same way you would expect a monkey to do, constantly putting money inside of it, even in those rare occasions when he won 10 bucks or so, while his girlfriend was constantly asking to leave that station. Me and my friend made a rough estimation on how much he might have spent in the ~20 minutes we were standing outside the room, and we came to the conclusion that he has dumped at least 60€ in that little time.\n\nI can’t understand the appeal of slot machines, it’s the lowest form of gambling, probably even the worst repaying one. I totally see the appeal of going to the casinos and playing poker or stuff like that, even the roulette has its moments, but those money dumpsters are just there to make the state eat some messed up people’s money",

I just want to know  how is it that they can't add more weapons at launch, but they can design a new weapon design every couple of days that costs almost a third of the price for the base game. It's got to a point where they add less content at launch, so they can charge us more as they slowly add new content to the game. Content that would have been there at launch all those years ago",

I bought a couple because they were all I could find and heard it go snap that night and thought ha! Got the little bugger. But I decided an hour later to dispose of the dead mouse and re set it. Naturally I wanted to be rid of the mouse, but when I went to pick it up the mouse was very much alive struggling to get out. I hate animal cruelty even to a mouse so I tried to release it outside as it had suffered already but it couldn’t run away and was obviously too injured. So I stomped on it to put it out of its misery. The trap was easy to set and bait but didn’t kill the mouse. I threw the remaining traps away in disgust. I didn’t want to torture the mouse, I wanted to kill it quickly and humanely. Horrible company. I told the guy who owns the shop but he just said that they were unable to get others atm and walked off",

It’s pretty easy for people paying hundreds of dollars to get this kind of medicine shipped through the company I worked with to their homes all around the world. I probably saw maybe 10 boxes just filled with herbal pills and syrups a day at one point.

Around 20 years ago I felt a disturbance a plague if you will, brought from the charred black molten depths of hell kidz bop 1. I have no idea how this sewage of a franchise still exists and has remained one of the most popular kids music franchises for over 10 YEARS since I last checked. Almost a year ago I convinced myself that “it can’t be that bad” by the halfway point of an album I don’t know if this makes sense but I felt entombed In my mind with all the song playing over and over again thinking to myself “I’d rather be buried alive”. I personally love music I listen to all genres and believe me I have listened to the entire stalaggh discography and this was still worse, the literal pained screaming of mental patients, rape victims, and abused children was more enjoyable than listening to these fuckin fetuses spit their septic throat bile chants repeatedly in the name of “kids music”.  Listening to any kidz bop album is basically voluntarily injecting yourself with battery acid. No child should be subjected to listen to this brain cell deteriorating cognitive thought roadblock.

Their bodies have no way to process the chemical, so it builds up and causes escalating brain and nerve damage. This will manifest as jerky \"twitchy\" movements and seizures.

Flea collars work by natural oils in fur which eventually covers the whole animal with the chemical.
