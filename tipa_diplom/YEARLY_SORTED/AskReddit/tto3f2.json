Once you're in a fight for your life, which all unmoderated Street fights are, rules go out the window. Easiest way to get away from someone, kick them in the inside of the knee or groin and book it out of there.\n\nBonus item:\n\n3.

If you are in an area you are not familiar with you can also ask the dispatcher for a safe location to pull over. If you travel to far without pulling over you can be arrested for fleeing and if it's not a cop well then you may  have just saved your life and the life others.

You're not the protagonist of an action movie that wins just because they're the noble victim or plucky underdog.  You won't just \"see red\" or \"go berserk\".  You won't remember that one neat technique you saw on tiktok 3 months ago.  People do not rise to the occasion, they fall to their level of training.\n\nAnd in this case, training means being instructed by a professional and having that training repeatedly stress tested in sparring.  Point-fighting in TaeKwonDo or working with only a compliant partner in Krav Maga doesn't count.  If you don't learn how to adapt to someone trying to thwart and hurt you in unexpected ways, your training is useless.\n\nAnd even if you are trained, it's not worth the risk if there's literally any other way out of a confrontation.  Even if there's a 90% chance of you winning a physical altercation, pro UFC fighters who knock people out for a living have been KO'ed by one unlucky shot in a real-life fight.  If you lose, the price you pay is up to and including your life. \n And even if you win, you might walk away with a broken hand and have to pay medical bills, or end up going to court, or might accidently kill the guy if their head hits the pavement wrong.  There's just no upsides to a fight if you have any other option.  Check your ego, de-escalate, and go home at the end of the day.\n\nLastly, as a side note, if you want to defend yourself but can't go through with all that training (or even with!):  Get a tool that works.  Kubatons, brass knuckles, and the like are stupid.  Tasers are unreliable.  Knives are risky and way more mentally traumatic to have to use than they're worth.  You can carry a gun (I do most days), but the odds that you will need to ever use lethal force are extremely rare and the legal risk is very high.\n\nThe number one tool I recommend for nearly all situations is pepper spray.  I carry mine every day.  If you think it's only for women or something, get that misogynistic, toxic masculinity bullshit out of your head.  Get a good, reputable brand like POM, practice with a water trainer, and carry it every day.  The legal barrier to using it is very low.  If you feel physically threatened, aim for the eyes and nose, and run away.  EZ PZ.",

We weren't sitting in the same 2 chairs but just near (bus was kind of full), this guy in the backrow was clearly drunk and possibly homeless. He starts bothering my friend, I was watching and she didn't seem fully in control of the situation so I spoke up and said \"she's fine you can leave her alone\" in a deep voice. I could tell this bothered him, we exchanged a few words. As we arrived at the bus station he got up and left, I told her to wait. The bus cleared out and we got off last. There are two main exits to the parking lot, this was at night, we were going to naturally go right with the crowd but I stopped and could see him standing near the exit looking back for us. I said we should go left instead (not much longer of a walk), we hustled left and got in the car we were going to, and I could see him walking back to the bus and looking around for us. Bullet dodged\n\n2) My new gf at the time who came from a safer community was with me at a plaza near my house. She's not used to having to look around even just going from mall to car. She was blissfully walking with a big smile, looking back at me and just walking forward thinking everything was cool. Meanwhile I'd spotted this guy stumbling toward us from 20 feet out, I told her to get on my left (he was on the right). Only when he got to like 5 feet she noticed him, and afterward thanked me for looking out for her",

            "text": "I late to this.  My best experience with really bad places is third world abroad.  \n\n1) You‚Äôre not in Europe/US. DO NOT take photos of cops or military.   Ever.  Do not take photos of areas with security.   You WILL draw the attention of people with guns and authority, they might let you just show you deleted the photos, but they also might take you or your phone or your cash or all three.  \n\n2) Do not take photos of people without their permission.  They might get mad.  In many cultures that‚Äôs offensive and they might feel exploited.   They also might insist you pay them.  And other locals will join in on that. \n\n3) Pointing is a bad idea in any hard place.  \n\n4) In the third world, you can be in the hardest place and things can still be peacefully and ok and safe.  But the difference in a hard place is how random or how fast things can go from 0(peaceful/safe) to 100 (shots fired/mob rule).\n\n5) Eventually, in some line, some woman will ‚Äúfaint‚Äù so you have to catch her.  That‚Äôs a scam. \n\n6) You‚Äôll probably be in a car with the windows rolled down.  There will be traffic and times where things slow to a crawl.   ripe pickings for someone to run up, grab your phone or backpack or bag, and run.  \n\n7) I promise you that you are not the street wise world traveler you think you are.  Act smart and like you know what‚Äôs up.  Internally know you don‚Äôt and be vigilant and careful. \n\n8) Understand how pickpocketing works.  Understand how grab and runs work.  They are not the same.  One is subtle.  The other is fast and aggressive. Be vigilant about both.\n\n9) Don‚Äôt leave bags behind in a car.  \n\n10) You‚Äôll see a lot of hard things and poverty. If you start giving out stuff like candy or money, you‚Äôll be amazed how mobbed you will get.  Maybe think twice and then five more times about giving handouts.   \n\n11) kids are used as lookouts.  Kids are used as bait.  Kids are used to mob you.  Kids are trained as pickpockets.  \n\n12) that local you don‚Äôt know who invites you to pretty much anything should stay that local you don‚Äôt know and have never done anything with.  \n\n13) Do not assume a rule of law or property rights.  \n\n14) ask the fare or cost before taking, consuming, or using anything.  \n\n15) in many places, the number one thing that makes you stick out is wearing shorts.  Grown men and women in Africa, for example, do not wear shorts.  \n\n16) if you have to say where you are from, say your state, not the US.  US can go over really well or really bad.   But it is rarely neutral.  ‚ÄúIowa‚Äù doesn‚Äôt get much of a reaction.  \n\n17) Your hotel room is not a safe haven.  You can be robbed in your room.  Your things are more likely to be stolen.  That little safe is not your friend.   \n\n18) A safe place in the day is not necessarily a safe place at night.  \n\n19) if you‚Äôre in the bush, and you get shot at, it is life or death.  Get out of there.  Once they shoot, they are committed. \n\n20) The NGO nonsense of ‚Äúno guns‚Äù or ‚Äúhumanitarian aid‚Äù on the vehicles doesn‚Äôt help.  Don‚Äôt think means safe passage.  It does not.  \n\n21) Do not assume UN soldiers are like cops.  They probably won‚Äôt help you if something goes down.  \n\n22) Be respectful in IDP camps.  That is people in their worst situation. You‚Äôre not a tourist and they are not a show. \n\n23) your passport is life.  I wear mine on a holder than t hangs around my next and sits under my shirt.  \n\n24) know where your nearest embassy is.  If not one for your country, know the embassy of a ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù country that respects the rule of law.\n\n25) those armed guards are not like cops.  They aren‚Äôt getting paid to help YOU.  Don‚Äôt get lulled into a false sense of security. \n\n26) a lot of local markets are selling a lot of ‚Äúlocal‚Äù stuff that is made in mass somewhere else.  Be skeptical, but have fun.\n\n27) store cash multiple places.  Shoe.  Money belt.  A little in the bottom of a backpack.  A little in pocket maybe.  A little in front button pocket.   Only show what you need to for a given transaction.  \n\n28) if someone is crowding you or bumping you, don;t worry about manners.  Be forceful.  Be loud.  Get distance.  And thst may require you to be hard with a girl or a kid.  \n\n29) study before you go.  Know local manners.  Learn some basic phrases.  Know what to wear.  Know how to act.  \n\n30) in some places, cash is king,  BUT they might not take your cash if it is wadded or torn or too old. Know this.  Have cash you can use.  And they will try to give you change in crummy cash that THEY took and can‚Äôt use.  Refuse it.  Or you‚Äô;l be stuck too.",

You‚Äôre gonna sleep either way)When traveling keep wallet / money in front pants pocket. Keep cash in separate pocket so if mugged you can throw the cash and haul ass. Don‚Äôt carry a big wallet this isn‚Äôt 1950. Carry cards and ID in separate pocket from cash. If bad stuff goes down, leave your credit card at the bar and call and cancel it a few minutes later. \n\n12. Don‚Äôt incriminate yourself to the police. Don‚Äôt unnesciarily involve yourself into witnessing a crime, if others are already calling the cops. If no one is in physical danger and you were indirectly involved in something and are not sober or 100% sure you‚Äôre squeaky clean in every way: think long and hard about how you look in a situation before you call the police. You‚Äôd be amazed how many people go to jail that had nothing to do with anything they were around. \n\n13. Never let someone on the street you don‚Äôt personally know convince you to go anywhere. \n\nMan I‚Äôve got a ton more.",

            "text": "I was an escort for many years and here is some advice for women.\n\n\n\n1. Never let a strange man help you with something. If he offers to help you bring groceries in or luggage, say no thank you. Don't be rude but be assertive. Make sure to thank him and rush along.\n\n\n2. Always lock your car doors immediately. When you get into a car only unlock the driver side, then immediately lock it. If you're going to take your shopping cart to the corral, even if it's just a few feet away, lock your car. \n\n\n\n3.Lock your door as soon as you get in your house. Make it a habit to check your windows often to see if they're locked. Invest in a door jam if you live alone. It's a bar that goes under the door handle and keeps the door from being opened. \n\n\n\n4. Have cameras in every room and a big ass dog. Get a gun. Learn to use that gun. Feel confident with that gun.\n\n\n\n5. When you're alone somewhere, like at a bar or waiting for friends, and a man is eyeing you, hunch your shoulders and widen your elbows on the table. This posture gives off a very sturdy don't fuck with me vibe. Make sure to notice him notice you with stern eyes. Don't give him a dirty look but show him you're aware he's making you uncomfortable. If a man ever makes you uncomfortable do not become smaller in frame and fold your hands and body inwards. Take a stance that makes you bigger and masculine looking. \n\n\n\n6. If someone is obsessed with you, grey rock them. You become so dull to them like a rock, they will eventually lose interest. Give them nothing, be as boring as possible. \n\n\n\n7. When walking anywhere alone, constantly look around you, and walk with a purpose. If you look like you have a mission people won't fuck with you.\n\n\n\n8. Learn the power of No. I said earlier that if a guy offers his help, to politely decline, However if a guy ever becomes pushy or he asks you something inappropriate, just say no. Nothing else. I can't tell you the amount of times I said No to a man and they recoiled back. They usually expect women to explain themselves and apologize or try to be overly polite to mitigate their uncomfortable feelings. So when you say NO, it throws them off. \n\n\n\n9. Never go somewhere without sharing your location with someone you trust. You ALWAYS let someone know where you're going, who you're meeting or going with and when you think you'll be back. \n\n\n\n10. Try to remember to fill up your gas in the morning. There is nothing scarier than being alone at a gas station at night standing outside waiting for your tank to fill up.\n\n\n\n11. Keep roofie tester cards in your purse. That way if you have a gut feeling about your drink you can test it. Sure most people will say just don't drink it then, but if you can show the bartender it's positive, they will shut that shit down real quick and pull everyone's drinks as a precaution. I've seen it happen and I was also a bartender for years. \n\n\n\n12. If you're a smoker, DO NOT go outside the bar alone to go smoke. A dear friend of my family was murdered this way. \n\n\n\n13. This may not be feasible for everyone but invest in a smart watch. If someone tries to take your phone you can call 911 with your watch or alert your emergency contact that you're in trouble. I've had men take my phone before and it is SCARY when you don't have a way to get help.\n\n\n\n14. Get a camera for you car. People think twice about shit when they know they're being recorded. Get cameras for everywhere. They are much needed piece of mind. \n\n\n\n15. When you get home and pull into your spot. Turn your lights off and keep your doors locked. Take a second to look around before you get out. Make sure no one is waiting for you. Do this every time. Before you get out, make sure you only have one thing in your hand, the key to your door. That way you're not burdened with carrying stuff. If you have stuff to bring in, you can wait until the morning or have a friend come with you. Don't be dickin around alone at night in an apartment parking lot. Also once you get out of your car, b line it straight to your door, don't fuck around, get in and lock your door. I know this may sound excessive but trust me, women living alone are targeted more than you think.\n\n\n\n16. My last piece of advice, God forbid you're in a situation where you're about to be attacked, act fucking crazy. Bark at them, freak out, get loud. If you run, the likelihood of a man catching you is high. He's stronger than you and likely quicker. However if you act like a crazy bitch, they might think twice about fucking with you. And if they do get ahold of you, fight. Don't act timid or meek, fuck him up. If he's gonna hurt you, he's gonna have to get hurt too. Men are by far and wide so much stronger than women but we have quicker reaction times. Use that to your advantage. Claw his fucking eyes out. Bite him. Scream. Throw your head back into his. Just anything. Be fearless. It's scary as fuck but it's your life. \n\n\nOr use that gun you should be carrying üòâ One of my favorite moments ever was a time when I was in an elevator with a large man and he seen that I was open carrying a 9 mil on my belt. His whole body language changed. He shifted away from me and acted timid. The feeling of power and safety was such a high. A grown ass man was actually scared of me! Now I don't recommend open carry, conceal is by far better because you don't want to invite that kind of attention but I'll never forget how it made me feel. I felt like how most men feel when they're around women. Like I had nothing to worry about. Good shit. Yea get a gun. And learn how to use it. Remember we have quicker reaction times than men.

I lived the life of 'Nightcrawler' for two years, but I wasn't a gypsy camera... I worked for a reputable news station.\n\n1. Even in daylight, watch for places where the streetlights have been broken.  Bad people, who like to hide in the dark shoot out streetlights.  If it's night, and you see a television running in an open window, that's a kid that might be a lookout.  You'll have the feeling you've been made.\n\n2.  When you drive to a place in the dark that you've never been to, drive in with the windows down and the radio off.  Turn off the car.  Count to thirty, and listen.  On a good night, without air conditioners buzzing, you can hear everything.  Then, get out of the car. \n\n3.  Drive in front of a place once before landing there.  Get eyes on it.\n\n4.  If you're on foot, know the outs.  Watch behind houses for fences.  Assume anyone that chases you knows the area better than you.  If you feel like you're being watched, you are.  Stop moving, stop breathing, and listen again.  Nobody wants to attack an aware victim.  If you hold your breath on foot, in about 45 seconds, you can hear everything.  Your ears adjust.  Cannot do it while walking and blood is pumping in your ears.  You can hear people breathing well over ten feet away if you wait long enough.\n\n5.  Assume all gut feelings are real and actionable.  Trust yourself.\n\n6.  I cannot stress enough listening. Most humans have no idea that we have, as a species, the ability to hear things further away than we think we do.  We have busy minds. And listening takes about a minute. Your brain can totally make a determination that there is a deer a hundred yards away in the dark, because in about thirty seconds of dead silence the brain starts shutting down uselsss background noises. The only lesson of this is: it takes a little longer than you think. \n(Second tier PROTIP:  it also works on your nose in the woods, but it takes a few days out of an urban environment.)\n\n**Edit:  People are liking this. So adding more. Got a few minutes.**\n\n7. Cars:  All headlights on vehicles are fingerprints. Every time you look in a rear view mirror, imprint the headlights in your short term memory. Try to think of what kind of car it is. Learn what headlights and taillights go with what type of car. Make it a game. Keep it as a background thought. It will trigger you when the third turn happens and the headlights are the same. \n\n8.  Cars again:  If you see the car too long and it‚Äôs bothering you?  Do something. Spin that block.  Drive illogically. If you spin that block, it will have to follow you in an illogical path. It takes a minute to do this and determine a tail.  Don‚Äôt ever stop, just drive a longer and more illogical route to determine if you‚Äôre being followed. If you‚Äôre being followed?  Don‚Äôt go home. Drive to a hospital ER entrance. There‚Äôs always security there.  They‚Äôre used to crazy.  And immediate medical attention if something is bad. And cameras. Lots of them. And all cops can get there without looking it up.\n\n9.  Don‚Äôt like guns?  Get a big ass knife.  They never jam.  They never need maintenance.  Nearly impossible to disarm. A cut is an instant win. The crazier you get, the better they work.  They scare the shit out of people.  A person shorter than ten feet away can get a kill faster than a pistol.  (They teach cops to shoot knife attackers at ten feet, still probably screwed.)  Got a Captain America shield?  Wearing knights armor?  Can‚Äôt stop it.  Turns a seventy pound girl into a seventy pound wolverine.  A 90 year old lady with a knife has about equal chance against a krav magra fighter unarmed.  Knives are in my experience, much deadlier than guns. I‚Äôve seen hundreds of gunshot wounds and deaths. I‚Äôve seen brutal knife attacks. All heavy stabs are 100% fatal. I‚Äôve never seen a multiple stab person make it out of an ambulance. 20 years experience. \n\n9.  And finally, final reiteration that your smooth little reptilian hindbrain has evolved running from creatures on this planet with big ass fangs and camouflage, and venom, and claws. Lots of claws. You, as a person, are a little animal‚Ä¶  and what your personality and identity is an evolutionary add-on that is pretty damn amazing.  The cauliflower part of your brain is in charge, but you have old brain down there underneath it.  When the little smooth part of your brain says ‚ÄúUh, run!‚Äù  DO IT, NOW.  You‚Äôre here because THE HINDBRAIN DID ITS DAMN JOB for millions of years. It‚Äôs not capable of expressing itself in letters or numbers. It‚Äôs stupid. It‚Äôs the heebie jeebies part of your brain. It‚Äôs very old. It misfires a lot. It will also give you fair warning.  \n\nStay safe people.",

If you're ever in trouble, they'll help you out if you've been friendly, or they may just pretend they didn't see a thing. They can also help watch your car - for instance if someone dings it and drives off, they might even get the plate for you.

Download apps that would serve as your gps. Some taxi drivers have drugs they use to get you to inhale and knock you out (they do this by shaking some powder near the airconditioning of the car so you directly inhale it - it's a subtle scent but it makes your throat dry). IF you smell it/suddenly feel drowsy, ask to be dropped off IMMEDIATELY or open the window. They would usually pretend to open candy, or smth, and the powder is usually in the candy wrapper. üî•EDIT: It's not a powder. It's a spray scam. They just shake or rub the candy wrapper to mask the sound when they spray it. \n\n- bring your own water bottle when going to a club. To be safer: order shots (shotglasses won't give them enough time to spike your drink) or beer so you can carry the bottle. Constantly drink water so you can \"flush out\" the alcohol in your system giving you a good buzz but not shtfaced drunk\n\nEDIT: omg I didn't know about the whole water and not 'flushing out' of your system lel forgive me for that - I've been correcter in the comments. Guess it just keeps you from getting dehydrated and gives you clean and safe drinking water.\n\n\nüî•üî•üî• EDIT EDIT: I think by now you guys know what country I'm talking about.

There was this time a newly arrested person got loose and went running in our neighborhood (we really leave near a jail), gun shots were being fired. The old dudes in our area all went out to see what was going on, they were initially thinking that it would be someone playing with fireworks since it's around January. They all went out mad and irritated. But when the police signals these old nosy huge belly men to get back to their houses, they went running! They can't ran fast having a huge beer belly ahead of them. \n\nThere were a lot of crimes being made just around our area. People are quite friendly but the danger is still there.

            "text": "1) If someone starts acting ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù about your belongings, get out of there soon as possible. For example, if you‚Äôre walking in public and someone says ‚Äúhey go around this way so you don‚Äôt scuff up them nice shoes‚Äù, 9/10 they‚Äôre sizing you up to see if they can con you or outright take it from you under the guise of being concerned for your stuff.\n\n2) If someone starts looking away during a heated conversation and turning their torso away, always glance at their feet and hips instead. People who‚Äôre about to punch you always angle their lead foot towards you while angling  their hips on a bladed slant instead of square. The upper body lies but the lower body never does.\n\n3) Say as little as possible. The more you say, the more they‚Äôre trying to figure out if you‚Äôre soft and easy to manipulate. By keeping your words to a minimum you can at least *seem* like the strong silent type. With that said, they‚Äôll likely still escalate to physically sizing you up if they can‚Äôt figure you out through words (ex. shoulder bumps, putting an arm around your shoulder, casually taking something small off your person and asking if they can hold it etc.) ‚Ä¶ at that point be firm and direct, don‚Äôt go along with it. \n\n4) Never stand your ground and fight. Strike first then run. If it‚Äôs 1v1 then there‚Äôs a good chance if you get the upper hand your opponent will pull a weapon. If it‚Äôs more than one person then no amount of training will prepare you to fight multiple pair of hands and legs at once. Anyone who has ever fought will tell you that even 30 seconds of a 1v1 is exhausting, now imagine 1v5 ‚Ä¶ you won‚Äôt survive.\n\n5) If you‚Äôre parking in an unfamiliar neighborhood, always back in. If someone tries to pull up on you then you can easily peel off. It‚Äôs harder to get away when you have to back out before throwing it in drive. I cannot emphasize this shit enough. \n\n6) Do not underestimate teenagers. Where I‚Äôm from, by 14 a lot of kids have already held a gun, and by 17 they‚Äôve either committed a murder or have witnessed one in the streets. Don‚Äôt let their baby-faces fool you.

A few days ago I was on the train in a car that was like 30% full. I was sitting almost directly across from a dude and we both had our phones out minding our own businesses. As we passed through a rough area a guy boarded and I immediately got the feeling he was scoping us out. I had a backpack with me that originally was lying free on the seat next to me but I instinctively wrapped the arm straps around my right arm so nobody could easily grab it and run off the train. I kept looking at my phone though and didn‚Äôt put it away, I probably should have. Would recommend that, if doing that, to remain calm and not gawk. Either way if I hadn‚Äôt secured my backpack I would‚Äôve appeared inattentive and likely gotten robbed. \n\nThe guy sitting across from me ultimately got his phone snatched right out of his hand. The thief timed it perfectly. As soon as the train started getting in to the next stop he made his move and was out the door as they opened. \n\nIf this happens to you, as tough as it is, DO NOT give chase. If you actually try this you will find yourself in the middle of an unfamiliar, usually dangerous area and without a phone or way to stay safe. In some cases the thief might even want you to give chase so they can kick your ass  in a more secluded area. Best course of action is to write down the train car number, the time it (likely) happened, stay on the relative safety of the train, and try and see if another passenger will call the cops/a friend.",

There's almost always an option that isn't run away or fight. Use the information at hand to find it. \n\nKnow if you would rather live a coward or stand up for what you believe. People who shame you for the first probably aren't the second.\n\nKnow where the most valuable things in your life are at all times and if you're asleep be able to reach them in under a minute\n\nAlways have water\n\nAt a party or event never go off alone with someone you just met without telling a friend and If you're that friend always check on your buddy both when he leaves and when he's supposed to be back. My sister's boyfriend and best friend almost got shot by some punks trying to get blooded into a gang because they went outside to sell the wannabe gang members weed and didn't tell anyone where they had gone. Luckily my sister got nervous and started looking around. \n\nAlways wear something you can run in.",

            "text": "I spent a few years as a thruhiker so I did a lot of hitchhiking. Here's my advice on doing that. (20 bullet points)\n\n1) Walk to the edge of town, and stand on the road that leads to wherever you're going. That way the drivers will guess that you're going to the same place. No driver wants to stop, ask a hitchhiker where they're going, find out it's not the same place, and have to drive away - no one wants the work, and no one wants the disappointment factor neither.\n\n2) Make sure your big hiking backpack is clearly visible. \"A hiker\" is a class-coded activity (thanks, Patagonia!) whereas \"a bum who shits in the woods\" is not. \n\n3) Differing opinions on whether to wear your backpack or have it at your feet. I prefer at-the-feet - it seems less imposing, but also, that fucker gonna be heavy when you're leaving town with a full resupply! \n\n4) Make sure your trekking poles are folded away and stowed in/on your bag. Differing opinions on whether it's better to have the tips visible, since it signals A) that you're a hiker, but B) that you're carring giant stabbies. I've tried both a bunch and haven't noticed a real difference.\n\n5) If you're carrying anything real stabby looking - *ice axe* in particular - make sure it's not visible.\n\n6) You can look like complete and utter trash, filthy and rotten like a damn Dark Souls mini boss - so long as you've got a smile on your face. \n\n7) Stand where a driver can see you for at least 5 seconds as they approach. 10 is better. This way they have a chance to check you out and think if they want to stop.\n\n8) Stand in a place where a car can safely and easily pull over to pick you up. Amazing how many hitchhikers don't think about this!\n\n9) If it's dark out, stand underneath a street light, so they can see you. I recommend standing past the center of the light, so that your face isn't in shadows. If it's dark and there's no street lights, you can also set your headlamp on the ground and shining at you - this looks so smart, or even so official, that it gets hitches really well.\n\n...And if this means you have to walk a mile or two up the road to find a good spot to hitch - do it!\n\n10) If a car pulls over, run up to the driver's side and say \"Hi!\" or \"Thanks for pulling over!\" You're gonna be in the car with this person for a while (I've had several hitches over 100 miles long), make a good first impression.\n\n11) This also gives you a great out. The driver will usually say \"where are you going?\" or something. If you've got a bad vibe from the driver, this is a way to get out of getting in the car. Like \"Sorry to bother you, I'm a hiker and my phone died. Could you tell me if this is <location>?\" When he confirms or denies, say \"Thank you! I'll get back to trail then,\" and turn around and hike away. You can also say \"Sorry to bother you, I fucked up my water supply and I was just wondering if you had a spare liter?\" This is more obnoxious... but like, in the Mojave or the Grand Staircase I have been *fucking tempted* let me tell you!\n\n12) If you get a bad vibe from a hitch, don't get in. Doesn't matter if it's awkward. Don't get in. FOR THE RECORD, this has NEVER happened to me. Not once. But I'm also a beardy man dude, so, y'know.\n\n13) I've had several hitches that were drinking while driving. Several that were smoking up. And one that was doing both (guy in his late 70s. Car was missing an entire door. Ended up spending the night at his mansion, yes, mansion.) Unless they're visibly too wasted to drive, I would not worry about it. The number of people who drink while driving in this country is absolutely bananas... but they have all been a better driver than I'll ever be! Also you are real likely to get offered a beer this way - and you ain't drivin'!\n\n14) I've also had several hitches that were quite open about the fact that they were transporting weed. Vast, gigantic amounts of weed. The correct response to this, as far as I'm concerned, is to say \"Wow! Cool!\" Because then there's a >90% chance you will be given free weed. Someone once handed me TWO OUNCES. I don't even smoke! BUT MY FRIENDS DID.\n\n15) If the hitch says something like \"I have a gun,\" it's not a threat - it's saying 'I'm picking you up but I'm real scared about it.' Mollify them. Say something like \"that's fine, I won't give you any trouble.\" \n\n16) If the hitch pulls over to get gas, I always offer them five bucks if I have it. They almost never take it. But like, karma. And often instant karma, i.e. that five bucks often turns into getting bought lunch or offered a place to sleep for the night. \n\n17) If the hitch pulls over and you want to get out of the car (to pee or whatever), there's a big question: leave your backpack or take it with you? I almost always take it with me. I'm terrified of the driver running off with it - either on purpose, or even accidentally, as I've heard has happened! I just say something like \"Hold on, need my wallet\" (or \"toiletry kit\") and then just take the whole bag, so it's clear I'm not doing it because I distrust them. The only downside here is that if you take your bag, there's less disincentive for them not to run off on you. But this has never happened to me before.\n\n18) If you're gonna store your pack outside - on a roof rack, or in the back of a pickup - use your straps to clip into something, so it doesn't blow away. \n\n19) A lot of drivers want to use you as a free therapist. No worries. Let them. Spread some joy in the world just by listening. And a lot of drivers got REAL interesting stories, and some are just so so sweet. \n\n20) Some drivers will offer you money. Ain't nothin' wrong with taking a 5 (or a 50), not in my book. Once I lost my wallet on a hike and I was *real* screwed. I just mentioned this out loud to the driver, but then said \"I'll be fine\" and didn't bring it up again. Every one of them offered me cash and most offered to hook me up with a meal or a place to stay. The cash saved my fucking bacon. I took one up on the meal... and thanks to the internet we're friends 4 years later, 3000 miles away. Just pay it forward, y'hear?",

You're no stranger to the streets, you've been in worse places before, and anyone fucking with you is fucking with the wrong person.\n\nCriminals from thugs to robbers are actually pretty selective in who they target. It's no different to bullies. If you look like a timid, confused tourist you're asking to be robbed.\n\nIf you look like you're more trouble than its worth, they'll usually pick on someone else.\n\nAlso, know when to stand your ground (most of the time) and when to give in (rarely).\n\nIn Cartagena Colombia I was surrounded by 3 gangsters who demanded I hand over 50 dollars in a shakedown or they would murder me. I refused, stood my ground, told them calmly while looking them in the eye I was a veteran, I didn't give a shit if I died, they were fucking with the wrong person, explained there were witnesses everywhere, and told them to fuck off and try that shit on a different gringo.\n\nAs soon as they realised it was more trouble than it was worth, and there were other easier targets elsewhere, they backed down.\n\nIm not a big guy, and while I can hold my own in a fight, there was no way I was beating 3 guys much younger and bigger than I was (and that's before the question of if they were armed or not). But I am a veteran, and I didnt give a shit if I died, and I sure as shit could have fucked at least one of them up before they took me down (unless a gun was involved, in which case I was deader than fried chicken).\n\nI put doubt in their minds. They're used to scared gringo's handing over money, and it wasnt worth murdering some random gringo over 50 bucks in front of hundreds of witnesses (which I was banking on). Some random Australian staring them in the eye, and telling them to take that shit elsewhere threw them.\n\nIts the same when the Cops shake you down for a '50 dollar on the spot fine' or whatever.

When suddenly a large dude, (I‚Äôm not small by any means but this guy towered over me) steps in front o me blocking my path. So my brain is just like ‚Äúhuh, what‚Äôs happening?‚Äù Then without a word he drops down to his knees in front of me. I‚Äôm scrambling to understand what‚Äôs going on and when I look down this guy is shining my crusty, 5 year old sneakers with a rag and a spray bottle. So he quickly finished and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh ah thanks,bye‚Äù I try to step around him and he gets up and blocks me and says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs 20 bucks‚Äù so I kinda laugh and say ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask you to clean my shoes and I‚Äôm definitely not giving you 20 dollars‚Äù that‚Äôs when he got really aggressive. He basically starts screaming for me to give him the 20 I ‚Äúowe‚Äù him. I try to walk by, nope he‚Äôs blocking me, so I spin around, which was scary because now my back is exposed to him and I walk the other way. So he‚Äôs following right behind me and then he grabs my shoulder and tries to pull me back. So I was just like fuck it, I guess this is happening. I jump back and get into my best ‚Äúfight pose‚Äù with my fists up like I was taught. He‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh you gonna fight me bitch?‚Äù So I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyup, I guess so‚Äù when he saw I was ready to actually throw down with him he finally just cursed me out and finally walked away. I still can‚Äôt believe how fast this encounter happened and escalated.

It sounds weird, but someone walking along sweeping their head back and forth looks like they're unfamiliar with the area. Don't look up a lot either. Practice right now. Look up at an angle and left and right like you're looking at street signs/storefronts. Doesn't it feel like you're lost? It projects that sense. Keep an eye at street level, keep awareness with your eyes, not head. Make use of reflections in windows and shadows to see if anyone's following you.  \n\nThis may all sound paranoid, but trust me. All it takes is for you to get sucker punched once before you start to think like this all the time when in public.  \n\nMy other piece of advice matches what a lot of people are saying. If there's a group of younger people (men or women honestly) who are being super loud and obnoxious to others around them there's a good chance that any sort of perceived slight against any of them will result in a fight. Loud groups of teenagers/young adults are full of hormones/machismo/anxiety and individuals in the group will always be looking for an opportunity to show off to their peers, often that comes in the form of starting shit with strangers.

If you must carry cash or otherwise on you, leave it in your innermost pocket, and just put a lock on it if you can. Carry a Fanny pack or other satchel that had pockets located on the front side of your body, within your range of vision. \n\nThere is always a risk of thieves going through your campsite while you are away. It happens less in VIP areas and smaller scale festivals, but it can still happen anywhere. When you are not ‚Äòhome,‚Äô put your portable battery packs, bongs, drugs etc *away in your car*. Especially during the Saturday and Sunday night headliners. This is usually when campsites get raided. PS, tent locks don‚Äôt work when you can slash through the side with a knife, and they only draw more attention to your tent. Again, leave your valuables in the car. \n\nDehydration can happen fast! Carry a camelback. Know where the water stations are. If you plan on doing stimulants in the heat, tell a friend what and when you take, and make sure you stay hydrated. Electrolytes are your friend. \n\nGod forbid, if you need to go to the medical tent or need to get someone there, use the buddy system. Make sure you and another person always know where the medics are and how to get to them. \n\nIf you hear someone asking for a benzo, they probably really need it. It stops psychedelic trips. Help them, if you can. \n\nBe aware of bottleneck areas and always make sure you have enough space. Do your best to avoid potential stampedes by having an exit strategy and knowing where you are at all times. \n\nBring ya vitamins.

Active perception doesn‚Äôt mean gawking, like others have pointed out already in this thread - don‚Äôt put yourself in a situation where you‚Äôre an up-close-and-personal witness to something nefarious then perpetrator doesn‚Äôt want witnesses to notice. If it‚Äôs unavoidable - you‚Äôre being attacked, say - that‚Äôs when you can get observant. Make note of anything you see to give to law enforcement - freckles? acne? Tattoos? Piercings? Height, weight, mannerisms, tics, what they‚Äôre wearing, accent, etc. It all helps.\n\nAlso, an addendum to the navigating new spaces and ‚Äúactive perception‚Äù - take very specific mental notes - on thinks that aren‚Äôt likely to change (seasonal or sale signs, for example) during your journey or be massively effected by light or time of day - of landmarks around major ‚Äúnext steps‚Äù in your course. Like, ‚Äúok, at the turn I make to get to the road I need to take, there‚Äôs a 7 eleven with the construction project out front. Then, keep walking until I see Smith Street, where I know there‚Äôs a bright pink house on the corner that I need to go down.‚Äù This kind of memorization has helped me so many times when my phone has died or I‚Äôm walking home at a different time of day and everything looks different. \n\nIt never hurts to travel with a portable, fully-charged phone charger battery thing and functional charging cord for all essential devices in your bag. This has also saved my ass. \n\nBe safe!",

Flash forward a few days; everything was going smoothly until we decided to have a few beers on the beach one night. To my knowledge we were not trespassing or doing anything illegal, but as we were about to leave the beach and head back to our hotel around 10 Mexican police officers stopped and searched us. There were no drugs on us, only a few left over beer cans. Thankfully one of my buddies knew a decent amount of Spanish to talk to the officers. However, they had their minds set that we were doing drugs and had been trespassing. As we were about to get put in handcuffs and brought to the station, we finally asked them how much it would cost to let us go (this was our first time dealing with Mexican police, so none of us thought that offering money would get us out of this situation like in the movies). Unfortunately, nobody in the group paid attention to my buddies dads advice except me. I ended up losing around $40 while the rest of my group lost ~$100 each. So Moral of the story is that if you are tight on funds and in a place you could get robbed, keep you money in two pockets.",

People WILL try to distract you. \n- Download a map of the city before you get there. Be able to access it quickly so people don‚Äôt notice you don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre going when you glance at it. Do not pull out a giant paper map if you aren‚Äôt in a safe place. \n- Keep a small amount of money in an easily accessible pocket in case someone wants to rob you, you can hand it off quickly. Or for buying little things without showing everyone all your funds. Keep your other money and phone in a money belt inside your pants. Money belts should not be visible. \n- Never keep your phone in a pocket, way too easy to steal.\n- Keep money hidden in different places. Bring plenty of cash, you might end up without an ATM   \n- Don‚Äôt carry your passport around with you unless you need it or it‚Äôs not safe where your luggage is. \n- ALWAYS travel with copies and pictures of your passport. Will make life a lot easier if you lose it. \n- Don‚Äôt wear expensive jewelry. Don‚Äôt try to be flashy. \n- Wear a fake wedding ring if you are a solo female traveler in case you feel like you need it (might need to claim your ‚Äúhusband‚Äù is meeting up with you soon). \n- Do not wear clothes with English writing on them, or anything that makes you stick out/easily targeted. You‚Äôre already a tourist, at least don‚Äôt be that obvious. \n- Most people are nice and will help you if you need it. Go into a store if you need help. Any restaurant or bar can call you a cab. \n- Make sure you are using real cabs (ask a local how to tell) \n- The police aren‚Äôt reliable everywhere, don‚Äôt count on them to help you. \n- Don‚Äôt show your documents to people claiming to be with the government. No one will need your documents unless you‚Äôre crossing a border or checking in to your hotel/hostel. \n- Don‚Äôt trust anyone in your hostel rooms- do not leave your phones out and charging. Use a portable charger for your phone in your bed overnight. Lock up your stuff! \n- There are SO many scams, just say NO to everything. No, you don‚Äôt know the time, you don‚Äôt know how to get to xyz, you don‚Äôt know anything! Try not to give attention to the people seeking it at all, keep moving. As soon as you say anything your accent might trigger further interaction. \n- ALWAYS watch your drink. Bartenders can be in on it too, pay attention. If in a crowded bar, always get a beer in a BOTTLE so you can put your thumb over the top of it for protection. *rule of thumb \n- Try not to get very drunk, you are very vulnerable and careless when you‚Äôre drunk!\n- People using alcohol/drugs sometimes act erratically, don‚Äôt engage, don‚Äôt make eye contact. Walk away from people acting strangely. If people insult you, not your problem. Be ready to run, ALWAYS better than fighting!! \n- ALWAYS trust your gut! You don‚Äôt have to be able to explain something for your instinct to be right. Exit whatever situation you‚Äôre in as soon as things don‚Äôt feel right!! Who cares if you were wrong? At least you‚Äôre safe. Always stay safe. \n- Use your manners and people will respect you- learn please and thank you in their language. \n- Much of human behavior is predictable. Have confidence and get help when you need it. \n- Respect the streets and the streets will respect you!",

Works de-escalating most of the time.\n\n2. You can only calm someone down if you are calm your self. Speak like a late night DJ from a radio station. \n\n3. However, if you get caught into an one on one, throw something to your opponent like an easy to catch ball. It‚Äôs an common reflex to catch it and thus is arms are blocked and he is distracted.\nIf you opponent wears an open jacket, try to pull it from the bottom above his head to immobilise him further.\n\n4. More than one people? Run like hell.\n\n5. When in foreign country, have some paper money in your socks and make a official copy of your passport before your leave your hotel etc.\nLeave the original passport in your room.\n\n6. If need some directions, asked pizza delivery guy for help, as they don‚Äôt need you to earn their money.\n\n7. When moving to a new city / country, make sure to be kind to every homeless people in your new hood. Talk to them, give them something to eat and to drink. Treat them like everyone else.\n\nBy doing so, they can give you some information about the neighbourhood.\n\n8. When travelling with a friend in public and who has your number and you want to talk with him in private, write him a message and ask him to show you ‚Äúthat meme again‚Äù he had shown your earlier today\n\n9. Obviously hear on your gut feeling \n\n10. When in foreign city, make sure to get familiar with your neighbourhood and make It your common ground",

I came from the punk experience of the DC scene in the early 1980s, but the best street sense is to stay on the street as little as possible. Make a beeline from point A to point B, and be aware of your surroundings.  No music on earbuds, you will be attacked right as the guitar solo got good like how Waze interrupts the favorite part of your song every damn time. Some other ones:\n\n1. Travel in groups. Punks made for an easy target, but we were known for being batshit insane among our own kind.  I am not sure the impact now, but in 1982, having razor blades for earrings and a safety pin through your nose or cheek meant, \"I enjoy pain, give me an excuse to die today.\"  Truth is, we'd probably run.  Pain fuckin' hurts.\n2. Fight crazy. Street thugs jump you, they are most likely just kids who want easy money. Don't make it easy. Bite, claw, spit, vomit. Also, in a group, all target one guy. If three people attack you, go for the closest one first, or the one who doesn't have an exit (sometimes they back away to draw you to the others, whio then all fight you). Once you have beaten the first one, the others almost always run. If you're outnumbered, and can't get away, and can't overpower them, make sure to go for the face, eyes, sternum, and kneecaps. If you're gonna die anyway, make them remember you.  But fighting crazy has an extra (but not guaranteed) element of fear.  Again, they want easy targets. Not hard targets. \n3. Never be the first to draw a knife, or any weapon, really. If they open with a gun, chances are they can't fight worth shit, but gun always wins.  \n4. Have a jeweled money clip with expired credit cards and a $20 bill folded around a bunch of $1 bills.  Toss it and run crying \"PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!\" You'll be out about $30, but not your wallet or cell phone.\n5.

The less you look like a potential victim, the better. Act. If you get lost? Pretend like you know where you‚Äôre going. Look for a bodega or a liquor store. *there are plenty of liquor stores in poor areas*. Don‚Äôt walk around looking at your phone. I find that a lot of times, women will call people to be talking to someone when they‚Äôre uncomfortable. That‚Äôs okay for a big city, but I feel like that just lets potential bad actors know what kind of phone you have in rougher areas.\n\nIf something seems off, square up, do your thing, be intentional with your actions, act confident. *Most* people won‚Äôt mess with someone who looks like they‚Äôre confident, because body language indicates they‚Äôre not easy prey. Obviously this doesn‚Äôt work as well for women, but it can, depending on the situation. \n\nLast but not least, leave prejudice a block behind you. Situations are dictated by whether people feel like you‚Äôre a peer or not. If you clutch your pearls like the stereotypical white lady trope from movies in the 70s, people will be less receptive to you. My experience has been that people in poorer neighborhoods are people, they have compassion, they have lives just like everyone else. Treat people like your neighbors and less like someone who you don‚Äôt want to associate with, and they‚Äôll treat you in kind. A lot of the game of life is a rat race of people scrambling over others trying to keep their heads above the water. If you act like a peer, you don‚Äôt get dragged under as someone who doesn‚Äôt matter. If you look and act like someone who doesn‚Äôt regard them as people, like you think they‚Äôre beneath you, people will turn on the jets and try and act dominant.",

Know your states concealed carry laws and which items you‚Äôre allowed to carry as personal defense weapons. DO NOT pull out a defense weapon unless you are prepared to use it. \n10. If you‚Äôre interacting with someone who appears threatening - take deep breaths, say as little as possible, remain calm/neutral, and create an exit strategy. \n\nSource: single woman living in Chicago",

He immediately looked at the ground and laughed nervously ‚Äúok ok ok‚Äù (note: do not be the first to break eye contact if you are doing this, let them know you will not be fucked with). I let him slink back to wherever he came from, and got to where I needed to be. When I got to my hotel room, the adrenaline wore off and I cried. I was proud of myself, but it was scary.

The question is rhetorical and telling you to mind your damn eyes. Do not respond like a numnutz as that will become the start of a convo you dont want.

Especially at night. \n\nOn the city bus, sit close to the driver. Shit always seems to happen further away from the driver. \n\nAlways walk in the most well-lit and populated areas, even if it takes you longer. \n\nWalk fast and deliberately and know where you are going. \n\nTry not to carry anything valuable. This was easy for me because we had nothing valuable lol. \n\nWear comfortable shoes that you know you can run in. \n\nBe overly kind and respectful to store owners and shop keepers wherever you are. You never know if you need to run in there to get away from someone. \n\nIf you hear gun shots, just get down on the ground or get out of sight immediately. Most shootings in our area were drive-by shootings so getting behind a parked car was easiest. \n\nWalk in groups. Always have friends or family to walk with. \n\nMake friends with everyone. My brothers and I were the only white kids in our neighbourhood. Can‚Äôt tell you how important it was to have friends from different racial backgrounds. It really helped that they all knew we were poor too. \n\nBe good neighbours. The bloods had a gang house on our street that was clearly a major meeting place. One day my dad noticed one of their guys was having car trouble on our street and offered to help him out. Got his car running again and after that he assured my dad that they would never give us any trouble.",

They probably don't actually want to hurt you, they just want money. They are targeting you because they think you will be frightened and will just do whatever they want. They are expecting you to be intimidated, so just don't be. \n\nIf you aren't scared, you will usually throw them off their game and that alone can often be enough to defuse the situation. They are looking for an easy target. \n\nI moved into Bed Stuy before it really gentrified, when people came up to me, I would usually give them and annoyed sigh and say I was busy. Since I was annoyed by them and not obviously frightened, they usually didn't know how to respond and I could just walk away. They thought that I was a white kid alone and would be automatically intimidated by a black man walking up to me. When I wasn't, they didn't know what to do. \n\nThis even happened on my last day there, as I was loading the car in broad daylight. A very muscular man came up and asked me for money and when I said no he tried to corner me in the alcove of my building. I just honestly told him I didn't have time to deal with him (was trying to get the car loaded up before the landlord came to inspect). He was visibly surprised by my response, he thought I'd be intimidated. I just stepped around him and at that point the building super noticed what was going on and yelled at him so he left. \n\nStay calm, you will know if they are actually willing to hurt you and most of the time they don't want to deal with the bother and potential consequences of getting physical. They are just trying to scare you into giving them some cash. If they can't scare you, they'll leave you alone",

Cars vary by turn radius, but I've never seen a car that couldn't get out of dodge in aforementioned setup.\n* In case of a car ambush, ram through. To do so in a regular passenger car, aim for the spot just in front of the front tire or just behind the rear tire. Brace against the headrest and cover your eyes for airbag deployment.\n* In a car chase, align with the car in pursuit and give your brakes everything you can; add a parking brake to the mix if possible (but not a \"parking\" gear!). Now you have rear damage, and they don't have a radiator. You can't drive far without a radiator. \n* When waiting for a left turn, never, *ever* \"pre-steer\" into it.

The fake one had like $100 in cash and a couple credit cards that didn't work any more. I don't know if he ever got mugged. He was pretty high income and AFAIK didn't frequent neighborhoods where a mugging was likely.\n\nMy much simpler wallet strategy is keeping it in my front pocket so it's harder for pickpockets to steal. These days I have a phone case that holds my cash and credit cards etc. so I no longer carry a wallet. The phone goes into my front pocket. Depending on what pants I am wearing sometimes it's a struggle for *me* to pull out my phone. No pickpocket is going to be able to extract it without me noticing.\n\nAnother advantage of *not* keeping your wallet in your back pocket is [doing that can fuck up your back](https://www.google.com/search?q=is+a+wallet+in+the+back+pocket+bad+for+your+back&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS997US997&oq=is+a+wallet+in+the+back+pocket+bad+for+your+back&aqs=chrome..69i57.12949j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).\n\nEdit: At intervals (annually?) take a photo of each of the important cards in your wallet (or phone case), esp. your driver's license and credit cards, *and email them to yourself so the photos can't be lost*. Wallet lost or stolen? Find the email and immediately call to cancel the card. Photograph the back too: that's where the number to call is. When you go to replace your driver's license, presumably it's easier if you can show them the image of the one you lost (I've never had to do this).",

It might feel \"rude\" to cut them off, but you do it once, and you'll never have to worry about feeling that way again. Because every single time, they immediately see that you've figured them out, and they will walk on to the next person with zero reaction. Don't worry about hurting anyone's feelings, because they haven't invested any emotions into it.\n\nThey're trying to get money or cigarettes, btw. Give them money if you want to, but don't let them waste your valuable time with their bullshit stories about trying to get bus fare, buying milk for an infant, etc. All fake.\n\nI would think this would be obvious. But I can't count how many times I've seen posts on Reddit from young people living in cities who have encountered these situations and just listened to the whole story, and maybe given some money, or said no and wondered if they did something wrong.",

Most people just try and get out of an uncomfortable situation as quickly as possible when they are overwhelmed and unsavory people take advantage of this and will make what they want the easiest resolution.\n\nThe most inoccuous example is the way cab drivers react when you land in a busy airport in a foreign country and the porter scam.  You are in an unfamiliar place, maybe don't speak the language, and everyone just rushes you so the first reaction is to take the first overpriced cab to get away.  The cab driver quickly muscles in and takes your bags even sometimes despite a protest.  He walks you out, puts your bags in the back of a cab, turns to the actual cab driver and nods then asks for a porter fee.  Classic tactic and entirely avoidable if you just sat for a second but I see almost everyone make this mistake the first time they travel.\n\nYouTube the Delhi train station scam, they literally have a whole system and a fake train station that touts will take you too and it is obvious when you think about it, but by keeping you stressed and acting instinctually (literally the top comment says follow your gut, scammer love those people) they can guide and direct you how they choose.",

It just prepares your brain and your behavior so nothing can really surprise you and left you frozen or not knowing how to act. That saved my ass on several occasions because it becomes your second nature (don't even feel it) to be aware of surroundings and wild shit that may happen. First of all you will exactly know what you need to do so you can stay cool headed and do what you have to do with peak efficiency. And secondly it gives you a confidence in unusual situations. You will give out the \"vibe\" that there's no messing around with you because you are mentally prepared for any possible shit at moments notice. Also it makes you more sensitive to other people's vibes so you can smell trouble before it begins. All conflict are usually over in just a few seconds and if you are alredy prepared and know what to do, there will be no wasted time. I am literally alive today just because of that. But big hurdle to overcome is not really being on edge all the time so you can be relaxed but prepared. We all do this in some capacity but if you \"train\" and think about every step then it's a small chance that you will be caught off guard or end up in bad position. Also learn to de escalate heated situations. Because then you have the choice of first action, punch, location, time etc...fl and stay safe ppl...piis",

If you get a bad gut feeling, even if you‚Äôre just walking down the street, it‚Äôs for a reason. Your brain may pick up on something subconsciously, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre getting that bad gut feeling. Humans lived outside for hundreds of thousands of years and we have evolutionary traits we developed for survival at that time. Just because we have lived indoors the last couple of thousand years doesn‚Äôt mean they went away. So trust that gut feeling. \n\n\n**Pro Tips**\n\nIf you use wired Apple earbuds, you can double click the volume thing and it will activate Siri. If you are in a compromising situation, activate Siri this way, and when Siri activates just say ‚Äú108‚Äù and it will activate emergency mode and connect you to 911 dispatch and start broadcasting your phones GPS/location. You can also say ‚Äú911‚Äù, but if you are in a situation where saying 911 out loud may compromise your safety, you can say 108 and whoever is in front of you (in America) will likely have no idea wtf you said or what it means (I believe 108 is the 911 equivalent in other countries)\n\niPhones have another neat little safety feature. If you press the lock button 5 times in rapid succession, it also activates emergency mode and does what I listed before. So if your phone is in your hand or pocket, you can just start jamming on that lock button. \n\nI‚Äôm sure android phones have some sort of an equivalent, so I‚Äôm sure you can Google them and find out. \n\nThe Apple headphone/108 trick and a bus that happened to be leaving at just the right time saved my life once before, so that‚Äôs why I mentioned it.",

Cars are still driving for a good distance in the middle of the road so there isn't much chance they'll suddenly shoot off the line like you would at a light or stop sign. They do this in a lot of Asian countries and even the drivers over there are conditioned to avoid pedestrians while driving. \nAlso ride your bike or walk against traffic so you can see potential dangers coming more easily. If a car is swerving or driving weird you're already in danger walking or riding ahead of them, not being able to see behind you. Going against traffic at least gives you some more time to react if you see something fishy.",

Almost always I made sure to walk with someone, if not, I'd have pepper spray or a key interlocked between my fingers ready to go. After a year of being scared to walk to my car every night, I started parking in the far left front of the Walmart lot.

Moms could wear a smaller bag around their neck to keep hands free and baby happy in shopping cart.\n\nI see it all the time...  Woman gets distracted looking for XYZ item, bag is sitting there in the shopping cart waiting for someone to either grab and go or discretely take an item inside like a wallet or a cell phone.\n\nEdited to add another one: when pumping gasoline, be sure to turn off the car, get out, lock your car, and *then* pump your gas.  A lot of people leave cars unlocked and running while they pump.  Handbag, laptop, wallet, cell phone all in car.  Robber comes up discretely on the opposite side and steals items etc...

They are dangerous and you want to keep an eye on the hands for them to escalate. \n\nSomeone is being loud and aggressive, hands up in a fighting manner, but you look in their eyes and you can see fear or uncertainty? They are less of a threat then the first example. \n\nSomeone has their hands to their side and you can tell in their eyes that they don‚Äôt want problems?

An ego battle voids everything I said above. You may find someone that acts tough but the eyes show they don‚Äôt want any smoke so your inclination may be to call their bluff.

Do a 180 without a word and head back to reception. Otherwise they will make a gigantic fuss in the hallway to try to get you to let them in or pay them off.",

It doesn‚Äôt matter how comfortable you are someplace, things change constantly. Just because nothing has happened there yet doesn‚Äôt mean nothing will ever happen there.\n\n\nIf something feels off, it is. Evolution has provided us with a wonderful gut instinct, meaning our brain will pick up on things we subconsciously recognize as dangerous. Our brain then sends out hormones that give us that strange ‚Äúoff‚Äù feeling and raise the hairs on the back of our necks. We actually become more alert and focused. This means we don‚Äôt have to wait for our conscious brain to catch up, giving us precious time to get away from whatever the issue is. There are a lot of small things people do that make them seem untrustworthy to our brains, even if you can‚Äôt put your finger on what that is exactly. Removing yourself from the situation before figuring out what the problem is is always better than having to fight/force your way out. Your instincts know this, trust them. They want you to survive above all else. They know better than you do.\n\n\nA great example of this is spiders. Do you ever get the urge to look somewhere and there‚Äôs a spider exactly where you look? It‚Äôs because your brain saw it first and now needs you to recognize it‚Äôs there. Without you consciously knowing you saw it, your brain logged it as important and made sure you checked it out.

A huge part of your gut feeling is your body subconsciously gathering information through your senses such as hearing and seeing. If you completely block off your ears you're missing a huge part of your reaction.The amount of people I see walking around completely deaf to their surroundings is wild af. \n\nGet off your phone while walking in these areas as well. Keep your eyes up and head on a swivel. Make eye contact in a non-confrontational way as you walk by. Studies have shown would be attackers will find a less \"combative\" victim. \n\nAlways walk on the side against oncoming traffic. You won't be able to tell if a car is following you easily if you're walking with traffic. \n\nKeep your jacket unzipped while walking. If someone grabs a handful of your bulky clothes you can shed it easily and sprint away while they still think they have you.\n\nIf all other recourses have been exhausted and someone tries to be violent with you, in the real world there's no such thing as a fair fight. The person who wins is the person willing to do whatever it takes to make it home that night. Bite, claw, scratch, break small joints like fingers, noses, kick in the testicles if a male, it doesn't matter. Fight like your life depends on it as it truly may. \n\nLook for your exits when you're in a closed place. You never know if you may need to run from some nutjob and in your panic tunnel vision will set in. \n\nIf a person pulls a gun in your face don't be a hero but remember that within 15 feet you can close that distance if it's not trained on you and remember you can survive several bullets in non-vital spots IF YOU HAVE TO. Don't do it unless you have no other recourse. Run first, hide first, fight last. \n\nThe pocket knife that you carry in your pocket for \"defense\" is literally worthless if you aren't trained with it.

Never walk toward someone who‚Äôs asking you to, ‚Äúhey come over here‚Äù is more like hey get closer so I can see if your a mark. If you got fancy clothes, watches, jewels, leave them at home if you plan on walking a significant distance in your local hood. It takes about 10 seconds to get your chain snatched, and maybe another 20 if I want the watch and wallet. I‚Äôve seen people get beat until they were made to take their nice new jacket off and HAND it over. If anyone ever asks you where you‚Äôre from, it‚Äôs in your best interest to let them know you don‚Äôt live around here and are just passing through. If you wore the wrong color on the wrong street, they are much more likely to let you pass knowing someone‚Äôs gonna miss your ass and you‚Äôre just a civilian. \n\nNow to some of my best tips. If the guns already in your face/out you already lost. You‚Äôre not John wick and unless you practice for that scenario then you might as well just let them have it and deal with it afterwards. Don‚Äôt fight for your car, fight for your life. NEVER go to an open air ATM always use one inside a facility if possible because I can rob you without a weapon for your entire life if I catch you slipping. If you have the option, stay fucking strapped or get clapped is my number one rule. It‚Äôs better to have it and not need it, then to get caught without it, and if it‚Äôs bad enough where you from it‚Äôs better to get caught with it too. If she‚Äôs too hot for you, keep fucking moving. And don‚Äôt walk around acting tough thinking it‚Äôll make you less likely to get caught up, I‚Äôll just bring the homies if I think I can‚Äôt catch you alone which is unlikely at best because criminals aren‚Äôt known for being smart.",

My parents were tricked once to going to an \"authentic Chinese food local that only the locals know of\". People are often payed by these places to bring people in. Plus, they will order for you and ask you to pay.\n\n2. If someone is selling \"there own personal music and when I make it big, you will have the first album!\" don't buy. This seems obvious but they try to guilt you by claiming they are a \"starving artist\", in reality, they get tons of money by guilting people.\n\n3. Don't walk alone if you have the choice. Bring someone with you no matter how small. My dad got separated in Vegas once. When we found him, he was with two street preformers(scantily clad, hired by casinos to make money) who forced him to take a pic with them. They then forced him to pay for the picture.\n\n4. FOR GODS SAKE DO NOT ACT LIKE A TOURIST ANYWHERE!!! seems like an obvious thing, but no matter where I went with my parents, they didn't care how they act. This puts a HUGE Target on your back that says \"I'm new in town and ready to be manipulated!\"",

There are plenty of trustworthy people, but I have met folks that look like they are straight laced, and ended up being super shady.On the other hand, I have met people who look like they came straight from the prison yard, and I could trust them with my life.#2 If you are a man, always keep your wallet in your front pocket in a crowded area. Women, always keep your purse/bag zipped, with one hand covering the zipper in a crowded area. It doesn't have to just be an area known for crime.#3 Even though I still usually give them money, don't believe people who come up to you with a sob story. I learned this one the hard way. And I have been hit with a different version of the same story several times. \"Hey man, my car ran out of gas, and I am trying to get my 8 kids back to whatever city 6 hours away. Can you help me out with some gas money?\" Or \"my car broke down 2 blocks down, and I need a new blinker belt. Can you help me out with a couple bucks?\" If they just came to me and said \"hey man, I really want a hamburger, or some crack, I would probably give them more money. But I don't like being played. So I usually give them like a $5. On the same note, if you see someone in grungy clothes playing music, pay attention to their instrument. Yeah, there is nothing wrong with throwing someone a couple bucks for \"free\" entertainment. But, if someone is playing a $1500 guitar, then they probably live better than you do. You can still throw them some change, but save your $10s and $20. #4 This one should be a given, but I have seen it happen more than once. So I guess it must not be. If you are drug user, don't ever buy drugs from someone you don't know at a club, concert, or festival. Or, in general honestly. But these are the places it happens most. There will be someone at a big music festival, and they will be approaching people \"hey, I have got this molly. $10 a pop\". There is a very good chance that it is garbage that has been stepped all over. Or, fake altogether. Or, even worse, it could be something toxic. If you have test kits, or you see them multiple days in a row, chances are pretty good it is safe(although I still wouldn't recommend it). Because if they haven't been ran off or beaten down within a day or two, good chance it is legit. #5 and most importantly. Trust your gut. If you are on a dimly lit street, or dark parking lot, or wherever in general, and you get a bad feeling, trust your gut. Leave asap.I could honestly make a list that would be much much longer, but these are some basic things that will keep you a little safer, and help keep you from being separated from your money",

Everywhere you go, observe your surroundings, don't let one thing take up your focus for too long. When you enter an area, ask yourself: Where are the entrances? Where are the exits? Who's here that I can see/hear? Who could be here that I *can't* see/hear? Of the people you can detect, what are they doing? Does your presence grab their attention? Make these observations calmly, nonchalantly. Don't draw attention to the fact that you're sizing up your surroundings. \n\nWhen in new areas, do everything you can to appear as if you're a native to the area. Especially when traveling. Don't let yourself seem like you're lost, unsure of where you're going, or new to the area. Don't gesture at the buildings around you, don't stop in the middle of pedestrian traffic to ogle the sites, don't stop to consult maps in public if you can help it. Try to keep your gaze at eye level, as if you've seen this area many times. Don't dress like a tourist. Make it seem like you're familiar with the area, and know exactly where you're going. Those who stick out will be targeted by exploiters or worse. Ideally, you want to embody the concept of a \"Gray Man\", someone so bland and assuming as to be forgettable. Don't wear flashy clothing/accessories that can either indicate wealth or draw attention from its design. Don't wear clothing unusual to the area. Don't wear backpacks that indicate you could be a tourist and/or that you are carrying expensive equipment and/or personal items. Dress in bland, dull colored clothing, that either appears cheap or *is* cheap, and that lack any designs or markings. Dress appropriately for the cultural area and climate. Use backpacks with featureless exteriors and that resemble normal day packs. Avoid wearing jewelry and expensive watches.",

Get angry, if you can force it, over scared. For women, think of the most vulnerable areas of your foe and what minimizes your weakness - nails and keys to eyes, face, neck and groin.\n\nCarry a fake wallet in an easy pocket, especially in new places. Fill it with an expired credit card or three, a fake ID (i.e. not an old one that shows *your* name or address) and what looks like plenty of cash - most street criminals just want the least painful payday they can find. By the time they look through and find 30 dollar bills and useless plastic you're hopefully long gone. \n\nDon't carry a weapon unless you really know how to use it, which applies especially to knives or blades - they're very easily used against you, which means you probably *don't* know how to use it. \n\nIf you live in a place where you can own a gun, don't just own a gun. Spend a few hundred on training and shoot regularly and get advanced CC training. If you believe CC is right for you, carry something small and well hidden but very accessible. Practice. You'll likely never need it, but it should be well rehearsed and in your muscle memory if you do.\n\nCarry a good jack and learn how to change a wheel. \n\nCarry jumper cables. \n\nAlways ride a tiger, everywhere.",

It's very unlikely but someone could walk right into that shop and assault you and nobody would jump up and save you. \n\nthe shock of the situation and them trying to process what is going on is going to stop them nobody is going to jump up and risk their safety for yours until they realize you might die. \n\nBut until they think \"holy shit this person is going to die if I don't do something\" they are likely to freeze and try and protect themselves. \n\n\n\nCarry two wallets. \n\none for unimportant cards like coupons, business cards and membership cards and a $5 bill and maybe some change.\nKeep this wallet in your back pocket.\n\nThe other wallet will hold all your important stuff like bank cards and ID.\nKeep this wallet somewhere else like the inside breast pocket of your coat.\n\nIf you ever get robbed give them the fake wallet with change and some money because their not going to ask you for your second wallet.\n\nTo be even safer put money from your real wallet into the fake one to spend so nobody will see you pulling out your real wallet to pay for stuff. \n\n\n\nCarry a plastic cup\n\n\nI grew up in a really bad part of town and this one saved me quite a few times.\n\nThe point of carrying a plastic cup is so you can pretend you're homeless. It won't work if you're dressed to good and I would suggest carrying a second wallet in that case.\n\nHow I have used it has been very similar each time, I found myself being follow by an individual or group of people. There's times when I could quickly lose them using public transit or knowing the area better and I would suggest that before this.\n\nIf you are trying to lose the person following you but can't seem to shake them sit down on the sidewalk or somewhere you think someone who is homeless would sit down to rest and pull out the plastic cup.\n\nWhen they get close ask them if they have any spare change so you can get something to eat. If they say sorry they dont have any ask them if they have a smoke. If they they don't smoke ask them if they could spare any food because you haven't eaten in awhile.\n\nEverytime I've used this it's worked on both groups and individuals in situations where I knew I was being followed and confirmed it by taking three rights and doing a loop to circle back to our original spot.",

I believe I'd read the tip in a women's magazine at some point in the past & it stuck with me, but I'm not sure, it could have just been instinct or luck. \n\nBack story: \n\nBack in the 70's I was a teen & got into a car with a stranger (I was hitch-hiking, which I usually did not do alone & had never been an issue & I did it quite often). The man turned up his stereo all the way & engaged the door locks. I asked him to turn the music down & he ignored me. I screamed at him to turn the music down & he ignored me. I unlocked my door & he hit the auto locks, over & over. I scrunched down into my seat & kicked his wind shied out. He immediately pulled over, turned off the music, unlocked my door & started yelling at me for damaging his car. \n\nThis next part shows what a total idiot I was back then. He called the police to make a report to sue me for damage to his car. I told him I had to dump my pot & bong & he said to go & do it, but stay in sight. He, meanwhile, pulled a large knife from under his seat & disposed of it. Stupid me did not convince the cops mention the knife, as I was so scared of being busted for my pot & bong & was likely high as a kite. Of course I look back now & am amazed that I 99% escaped being murdered & worse. The worst part is that my dad actually did pay to replace his windshield. My dad & I didn't discuss what happened as far as I recall, but I was always the 'wild child/black sheep' of the family, who drank & it did drugs from my very early teens. He might have just chalked it up to another of my bad behaviors.",

Things go bad, you already have a friend who will help you.  \n\nWhen walking on a city street, walk with purpose, don't gawk at the big buildings, and don't make eye contact with anyone (dark sunglasses help, but don't turn your head, just be aware with your eyes).  Just keep walking if anyone tries to engage with you. The panhandlers are used to it, and the theives will find an easier target.\n\nKeep your wallet in your front pocket.  If in areas known for pickpockets, (NYC, Rome, Paris, Istanbul) have a dummy wallet in your back pocket with expired credit cards or store loyalty cards and just a little cash, but nothing important. \n\nSomeone pulls a knife or a gun, give them whatever they want and run if you can but DO NOT get in a vehicle or go in a building with them.  If you get in the car, you are dead.  So, outside, give up or run.  Vehicle or building entrance, fight with everything you have, and fight dirty.  Bite, scratch, kick, put your finger down your throat to throw up and disgust them, dig your fingers in their eyes, but don't go anywhere they have control even if you get hurt or are risking death.   Most people who are shot or stabbed survive.  Most theives don't go to the range and learn to shoot.  Your odds get better the more distance you get.  If you are near water, dive deep, bullets lose all their speed in just a foot or two of water.  Don't imagine that carrying your own weapon protects you.  More people are stabbed or shot with their own weapon than save themselves.  If you do have a weapon though, don't threaten, just use it.  The more time the opponent has, the better their chance of taking your weapon.   \n\nNot street, but forest....  Bears move way faster than you think.  See a bear, make yourself loud and big, and move quickly but calmly in the other direction.  Don't take time to get a picture.  Mountain Lions, do not turn your back and DO NOT RUN.  Walk away keeping eye contact the entire time.  If you get attacked, protect your neck with anything you can.  Pack, stick, hands.  Like advice above, fight dirty.   (For those in India, same advice for Tigers.  I don't know enough about African lions to give advice, but I assume it is similar to American mountain Lions).",

A lot of these tips are coming at it all wrong, and clearly from people from the Suburbs...\n\nMost important tips I've learned living here that get me by:\n\n\\-Walk with purpose.  \n\\-Be aware of your surroundings  \n.-Be respectful. Don't be cagey, afraid, or defensive.  \n\\-And rule of thumb: If you feel unsafe, you've got no business being there.\n\nBeing aware of your surroundings also means being self-aware. Know how you come off. Understand, what's the \"ghetto\" to you is just home to the rest of us. Consider things from their perspective. You are the intruder. There's nothing more degrading (and provoking) than minding your own business when a stranger suddenly looks at you like you're about to kill them, or pretending you're invisible. Which brings me to the most important one: Be respectful.\n\nIf somebody asks for money, don't get irritated. I used to. Now, I keep honest and empathetic; \"You and me both, buddy. Waitin' on Friday! Next time, I got you.\" Does it rope me into a aimless convo sometimes? Sure, but it disarms them. If you just give them that little human recognition, I swear to god it changes the whole atmosphere. The whole block sees the way you treat people.\n\nA lot of people saying \"blend in. Don't look like a tourist.\" lol There's no hiding it. Trust me, if you're not from here, everybody instantly knows. If you don't feel safe, you don't belong. Period. Don't care if you're urban exploring, or there's some trendy nightclub in an industrial park... If it's not your city, or you don't know how to read the neighborhood, these places are closed off to you. Half the time people walk into trouble because they carry the same sense of security and entitlement they getting walking around their own hometown. \"The hood\" is a neighborhood. People live here.

If you have enough information it's probably too late (In a bad way). This doesn't always happen (sometimes everything it's ok), but remembering it will prevent you from ignoring the warnings your brain sends to you.\n\n-Try to walk with attitude but without being too aggressive. This is mainly useful when walking through dangerous areas or walking near a group of suspicious people. Also, if for example; a group of suspicious people are going to pass by your side, do not look at them but try not to ignore them. Looking at them or ignoring them can draw their attention, even being attentive to their presence you must pretend to ignore them. To do it you must look ahead (where there is no one) but you must not stare at a fixed point, you can use cars, traffic lights, other people walking and other stuff as a reference. The point is that your eyes will not seem to be looking at a fixed point, but you will not be moving them like a crazy person (that will make them think that you are nervous and afraid of them or just get their attention), your eyes will just move slightly but enough to seem like a natural, nonchalant movement.\n\n-You must look tough but not overly aggressive. You just have to look like someone who could cause problems if someone try to annoy you but it doesn't mean you need to look like someone who can fight against 1000 people at once.\nCriminals usually prefer victims who are vulnerable, so you don't have to look vulnerable, but also, you don't have to look provocative. You do have to look a little (or \"enough\") rough.\nI usually use this when I go at night through dangerous areas, obviously it does not guarantee your safety but it increases your chances of survival a little.\nSince you never know when you will have to use this technique, you will usually have to improvise with the clothing you have. If I have a jacket, I put on the hood (I stretch it slightly from the sides to broaden my vision and hearing since wearing a hood can also be a disadvantage), I roll up my sleeves, close my jacket and try not be showing the valuable things I carry above.  \n\nNote: If you are a person whose facial features can be intimidating or if you are a little expressive person you should try to cover your face with something but without looking weak, something that leaves a mystery about if you are a person to mess with or not (humans by default we judge the appearance). Usually when agrgressors don't have enough information they will prefer to avoid you (from their point of view there is a possibility that you are crazier than them). Usually people with little expression or intimidating traits make potential aggressors feel threatened (even if you have not done anything) so it is likely that they will try to attack you just for that.\n\nI clarify that this is not a definitive guide and I am not responsible for what happens to you and what you do with your life, I speak from my experience and knowledge.  Take this comment with a grain of salt.",

I did know where I was, just didn't know where to go from there to get home. I got on the wrong bus and I ended up even further away from the house and now completely lost. I had been walking around for what felt like an hour or two and was trying to figure out what to do next. I knew the only thing I could really do was ask someone if I could use their phone. Obviously I had never gotten lost before because I never went out alone but I knew I couldn't ask just anyone I see. I am much more comfortable talking with women (I know that not all females have good intentions but I can tell when someone's not trustworthy, most of the time and I didn't trust any guys because of previous events in my life. Either a nice woman or anyone elderly.) After walking around for a while I ended up at a dog park and I saw a woman with 2 kids and her dog just about to leave. I quickly walk up to her asking to use her phone, we went to her car which was near-by (she left her phone in the car) and she gave it to me and I contacted my sister. I didn't tell her I had gotten lost so she thought I was at Hungry Jacks and told me to wait there. Knowing this woman had 2 very young kids (And she seemed very sweet), I asked if she could quickly drive me back. She agreed, even offering to drive me home (I didn't want to go that far, however). She dropped me off at Hungry Jacks and drove off just before my sister came and picked me up & we went home. Her name was Susan:)\n\nI know not all men have ill intentions but being a young female, I did not want to go with men I didn't know or trust. \n\nLooking for/getting help from somebody with kids or the elderly is always a good idea.",

If they are doing something clearly illegal, make a show of looking the other way. Look the opposite direction and up, and pick up ur pace. Never run. Never stop walking. Never break your stride. Walk like your house is around the corner. \n\nAs a women, if you are accosted or attacked in a neighborhood, don't scream wordlessly or help or rape. Scream fire. Nothing gets people's asses in gear like the possibility of their shit being in fire. \n\nAs a women, if attacked by a man, don't go for the nut shot. Men are hard wired to protect their sack. Instead, fake a knee or kick to the groin, and as they twitch down to cover their jewels, slam the hell of ur hand up into their nose like u want to see the back of ur hand behind their head, using their own movement to assist the hit. A broken nose will blind every human for at least a few seconds, regardless of how strong/determined/high/drunk they are. \n\nBe aware of what your vehicle looks like to the casual observer. Everything from the way you park to the stickers you have can tell people a lot about you. For example, if you have one of those stickers that show what marathons you have done, that tells me that you often go for long runs alone. If I follow you around long enough, eventually I will get u in a position where u are in an isolated area and no one is expecting you back for a long time. Do you have stickers about your spouse's military service? That tells me you are alone for long periods of time. Stickers with your kids school info? All I have to do is hang out around that school and I'll find you eventually.\n\nMost people who rape or attack women are known to that women. So don't let ur guard down just because it's your husband's/boyfriends friend/coworker/family member. Obviously don't treat trusted people like potential threats, but always have an idea of how to get out of a situation where u are alone with a man. Know your exits. Know where possible weapons are. Know how to get out of the room without arousing suspicion or anger. Know your audience, and figure out quickly what u would need to do to separate yourself from the situation. \n\nYou don't need that random dude from the bar/work/the street/your friends house to walk you home or to your car.

If you are sober enough to drive you are sober enough to walk to your car without a random man escorting you. A friend, absolutely. A friend of a friend you only met tonight? Nope. \n\nIf someone knocks on your door with some sales pitch, and they start asking questions about when your boyfriend/roommate/husband will be home, close the door. Any outside sales person can sell to a women just as well as they can do a man, there is literally zero need for a legit business to know that info. And they know that, and won't ask it.",

            "text": "Learn to be early everywhere you go, so you are not rushed and distracted. Know what's going on 360 degrees around you at all times. When you get out of your car for any reason, however briefly, lock it, keys go in your front pocket. Don't let anyone walk between you & your car - just casually go lean on the driver's door. Don't gas up at a station next to a freeway entrance ramp - carjackers favor those. Almost always, a bad guy tries to engage you on some premise before starting shit, so make a solid habit of not letting people walk up to you and ask for something, or get your attention from a distance. Always pretend to be busy but alert, walking fast, no time to stop. Learn to fade from the scene when you see someone spot you from down the block & head toward you to scam or pandhandle or worse. By 'fade' I mean time your move to scoot into a building when you see someone approaching to try to hit you up when you're getting out of your car - fade down the next aisle in a store, fade out of the bar when someone starts acting up. Even if they're not targeting you, don't look interested or shocked - just quietly and quickly slip out without looking like you're rushing. Always be ready to change your plans to evade a problem person. See a weirdo coming down the block - wait inside the building, out of sight, until they go past. Never let anyone follow you, on foot or in a car - if you're being followed to your car, don't go to your car, unless you're far enough ahead to jump in and drive away. Don't let cars sit exactly beside you at a stop light, where your face is directly in their line of vision. Preferably, stop slightly behind the car beside you, where you can see their head, but they can't see yours. Wear sunglasses and don't turn your head to look at people - just shift your eyes. If someone pulls up behind you in the right lane at a light, and they seem AT ALL weird or look like they might get out of the car, turn right and go. If anyone behind you starts to get out of their car, go through the light, over a curb, anywhere - just get out of there. Do not stop so close to the car ahead of you that you can't drive away if someone behind you starts acting up. Never let a cop follow you - they are looking for a reason to pull you over. No matter who you are or what kind of car you're in, if a cop follows you, he intends to pull you over as soon as he invents a reason to. If a cop is behind you in traffic, change lanes so he won't pull up directly behind you. Always keep at least one car between you and a cop car. Never pass a cop car. They usually don't bother with the cars behind them, but if you look like a nice juicy fine, he might pull over and wait for you to pass him, so don't take a chance - go around the block or take a different route rather than get stuck beside or directly behind a cop at a red light. If the cop somehow gets directly behind you, pull into the VERY NEXT business driveway, before he has a chance to make up a reason to pull you over, and calmly but quickly go inside the store as if you are running a quick errand. You will be on private property and he will have to have more of a reason to accost you, rather than on the street where he can make up anything and call it a \"moving violation.\" Never look at the cop - he will think you're up to something.

Don't look or act like a victim, and you probably wont be one.\n\nIf you do find yourself in a situation were someone has confronted you, there are a few things you can do. De-escalate, flee or fight. Personally I would do them in that order. If you do want to fight, you need to think about a few things. Who has more to lose? Some crack head who wants to have a stoush? Or some loser who wants to prove how \"alpha\" he is. Or you? Are you prepared to potentially have an assault charge laid against you? Perhaps be charged with fighting in public or drunken disorderly? Will a criminal record effect your ability to work, or travel? Are you prepared to perhaps be seriously injured or killed from being knocked to the ground and having your head bounce off the concrete?\n\nIf violence is unavoidable then you need to strike first, fast, hard and often. You don't stop the fight when you think the threat is no longer present, or if he goes down. You need to dominate the threat with an overwhelming show of force and violence. Ensuring that they wont want to continue the fight when they get up, and also dissuade any potential accomplices. On that note, don't make it a long drawn out affair. Your goal should be to neutralize the threat and then practice some nike-fu or run-jitsu and get out of there.  \n\nI'm not saying to cross the line from what could be constituted as reasonable force in a self defence situation.

Does the elderly person using a Walker need to earn it in order for you to open and hold the door for them? \n\nBeing respectful is street smart because respectful people:  Respect other people's space and boundaries. This is important because it means that they won't draw unwanted attention to themselves.  Someone who treats everybody with respect has more friends and little to no \"enemies\". More resources become available.  Resources such as favors, advice and even something like someone \"putting in a good word\" for you if you're trying to find a job.  They usually think more than your average shithead and can remain calm in situations where most people panic. That's just a few but Im sure you can think of hundreds of examples. It's a shame that people are so bad to each other and that it isn't the standard; it's a hopeful expectation at best\n\n A little respect goes a long way. But, since everything has a flip side, never over extend yourself for anybody unless they deserve it. Showing too much respect  can turn you into a door mat and people will take advantage of you. There's a difference between being respectful and being too nice. You shouldn't be rude and impolite, but you can be respectful without necessarily being nice. If you're too nice then you might come off as full of shit. \n\nThat said, respect yourself first before anyone. \n\nRespect shouldn't have to be earned but can be lost. It can be earned back, but that's the only example I can think of in terms of respect being earned. \n\nTrust and respect are not the same thing. Trust needs to be earned. Dont assume anybody has your best interest in mind and never give them the benefit of the doubt until they have repeatedly shown that they're authentic. You should be very selective about who you actually trust and even they can still screw you over. Dont assume the worst in a person, but definitely never assume the best. Time tested, trustworthy people in your life should be revered and held in high regard.",

This particular event was setup to allow anyone in for free and from multiple streets.  It was a literal gangsta paradise where all the gangbangers would show up and represent. \n\nSo much so, that the SAPD set up a processing station with a caged area at one of the entrances and a patty wagon to drive a few blocks of to the magistrate.  \n\nAnd of all events, it was a carnival mixed with open market dining and music.\n\nSo, we decided to leave and headed back before the rush before it closed.  As we're walking down a side street, I notice a mob of about 20-25 men with a couple of women in between.  I could hear them being rowdy at first and then I confirmed what i thought i heard.  They were yelling a gang phrase and that identified them as an up and coming prison gang that was getting known big time on the streets.\n\nMy wife said let's cross, I said nah let's keep going straight.  Mind you'll, she's from the Westside projects aka courts.  She knows that life very well but this was different cause they were getting rowdy.\n\nSo we walked straight, made eye contact with a few, made a few head nods, exchanged con permisos y respectos and kept walking.  \n\nWe got to the car, I looked back and heard some yelling.  A few guys were whistling at a group of girls with one guy.  That guy pulled out a gun and so did they...\n\nI hurried her into the car and started hauliing ass, then the gunshots started.

            "text": "I've got some decent ones.\n\nIf you're committing a crime, or about to, don't make it obvious. example: shoplifting or stealing in general. If you're about to steal something, dont do a look left look right, thats way too obvious even for someone who may not be focusing on you. Instead use your ears. You'll be able to hear if someones behind you, or even next to you. Obviously do the whole get close , grab it and slide it into your pocket. One of the biggest issues with theft is the person being too paranoid about being caught. Chances are people arent even focusing on you or are even gonna notice. I can confirm. In my class I always like taking people's things as a joke, and most of the time when I grab someones phone or water bottle off their desk when they aren't looking no one even notices until they see its gone. Next, don't act suspicious as hell. Dont go keeping your hands in your pockets or being overly protecting of the pocket or whatever you put it in, that'll make people suspicious about you. Just act normal. Pickpocketing is much harder, but very useful. If you're pickpocketing a bag, make sure the person isnt paying attention, and dont be too slow about it, but dont be too fast or obvious. If you're going for a pocket, thats where the fun begins. If someone's dumb enough to put their wallet or smthn in their back pocket thats a jackpot there. You dont need to be as careful there. In fact just go up, yank it out and start running the direction their back is to, so if they start spinning, head where there back is going to, it'll confuse them for a moment longer, and always try to duck into crowds, or go down hallways and take turns when they cant see you. Never get yourself into a dead end. Don't hide in a closet or something without a second escape. If you find yourself in a dead end (alleyway, hallway) find something to hide in or behind. If its an alleyway you're more likely to find a trashcan or dumpster to hide next to until they go down far enough for you to run by them and keep going. A hallway might not be as lucky because if theres a closet to hide in, they'll probably check it. If you get into a crowd, run a decent depth into it, then just start walking and weave yourself into it. Its much more obvious to find a person running and shoving through a crowd than it is to find a person calmly walking with the rest of the crowd. Also, always wear something easily removable over your clothes. Dont wear any obviously identifying pants (yoga pants with a special name on it, anything like that) go for something plain and simple, jeans or yoga pants, maybe not even cargo because those arent exactly everywhere. Wear something like a thin zip up sweater/hoodie, something cheap so you can unzip it then just toss it. I'd recommend actually buying some cheap zip up hoodies just for that. A zip up specficially. Dont use a flanel or coat that has buttons, that takes too long to remove, and over the head is too obvious, and takes too long. Never bring a bag, thats an obvious identifier.\n\nNow for protection from theft. I dont have too much for big things, but wallets and phones are a big one. Obvious one is to keep them inside your coat if you have one on, or something zipped, however you might not always have one on you. If you're carrying a purse or bag, dont put the valuables in there, its so much easier to pickpocket a bag rather than a person themself. Most of the time they'll focus on the bag just because of that. If you dont have a bag or coat on keep your valuable items in your front two pockets. This is seriously important. I have no idea why people put their wallets in their back pockets. If someone walks by you, or up to you from behind and grabs your wallet from your back pocket you have to feel it, register it, notice its gone, then spin around and start chasing them. If its in your side pocket though, thats harder. Its right next to your hands, and your side vision can help you notice anyone coming up to do it. If they reach in to grab it they'd have to push past your arm, or go from behind, but even then you'd be able to just grab their arm.",

I believe I prevented myself from being raped or worse because the guy had a car running in a nearby alley and could have easily grabbed my purse while it was dangling off my arm, my being engaged in lighting a cigarette.

He withdrew his hand instantly and streaked off to his running car.  I even had the presence of mind to pick up an earring that had fallen during the struggle and thought to wait while the car drove out of the alley to check the license until I realized he might shoot at me.  Instead, almost laughing, I stumbled into a nearby restaurant, borrowed a phone and called the police.  Until that night, I had no idea that virtually every black male in New Haven wore a baseball cap!  So, no, he was not caught.\n\nThe second time was in broad daylight, in New Orleans' French Quarter.  As he was walking past me, a little Hispanic male reached up and grabbed the strap of my crossbody purse.  I fell to the ground, fortunately, on top of the now-broken strap.  We struggled on the sidewalk; as hard as he tried, he could not free the purse...\n\nMeanwhile, I could see the crowd of tourists surrounding us had suddenly stopped their chatter to watch - and record the struggle on their phones - as IF it were NOT a mugging but some kind of attraction\\~!!!

The only way to get real information is to find the expert in that field and read their peer reviewed work. Still at the same time you need to understand that expert's biases by looking at their past work and other researchers who published in top journals of the same field on the same subject. YouTubers and media/articles online that talk on a multitude of subjects or cite experts on a subject simply don't know how much they don't know (if that makes sense). If become a true expert on anything, I mean top .01% of people in the world on that subject so you are truly an expert, you quickly realize how much there is and how deep of an understanding it takes to know something so niche. You cannot trust anyone except what you hear DIRECTLY from the expert or from your own work.  \n\n\nI can go off on things that you hear all the time are \"true\" or \"fact\" and people even citing scientific studies to back them up BUT the studies don't actually say that at all.",

A knife, pepper spray, or even a lighter can make your hands harder if you grip it when you punch someone. If someone offers to sell you drugs (even if you do drugs) turn them down. They‚Äôre probably scoping whatever cash you‚Äôre holding. Keep your phone light low so people can‚Äôt easily read what you‚Äôre texting. This helps if you‚Äôre communicating your destination to a friend. Same thing goes for verbal communication. Don‚Äôt mention your destination out loud while you‚Äôre on the phone. If you‚Äôre using a travel app, conceal it as best as possible to hide that you‚Äôre not totally familiar with where you‚Äôre going. If someone asks you for a cigarette, a lighter, the time, anything, they might be trying to get your hands in your pocket and away from a defensive position. Avoid small talk with people. Even clerks. Clerks live in or near the area, they see certain people every day. If a group of teenagers is walking up to you while recording you, they‚Äôre probably doing a smack cam. If you‚Äôre a male and a female is flirting with you on the L she may be baiting you.

Fighting should be the last resort once all attempts to stop it seize. A fight in the streets isn‚Äôt for fun it couldn‚Äôt very much be life or death so finishing your opponent makes sure they do not get up with a weapon or hit you if you get off because they yell stop I‚Äôm done.

We would always walk past this one house, keep in mind, the house owner we knew well, he has a bright red face and wrinkles from all the cigarettes he smoked. He was alright, abit odd, but we would stop to talk to him once Inna while. Every time we would go past his house, he'd have hundreds of kids bikes lined up on his lawn. He has a 19 year old son, that doesn't even live with him. Anyways, we would ALWAYS, see new things on his lawn, he would sell them for cheap too.

            "text": "I feel like this one is already pretty well known. I don‚Äôt really know what title to give it so imma just explain it and hope you understand. So for a little context, I grew up in New York City. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, NYC is beautiful, very touristy. But like most big cities there are the sketchy, ghetto parts. Now where I more specifically grew up was just a couple blocks down from Times Square, So not super sketchy but I do definitely remember seeing some pretty mm questionable things. I think the reason the area was so  sketchy was mainly because they sell/sold Weed directly off the side of the street. I always found that kinda scary because the amount of incredibly zooted people walking around made it definitely eery. Now I‚Äôm a girl. And as most people know being a girl comes with it‚Äôs risks. And being in big cities that you know can have a lot of crimes committed it made it pretty scary walking the streets. Once my friend accidentally looked at someone wrong and well‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt end to well.  Didn‚Äôt help that the person they looked at was absolutely drunk out of their mind. So that being said said my ‚Äòstreet smarts tip‚Äô would be when walking the streets of anywhere, always look directly ahead. No matter what always look like you know where you‚Äôre headed and always look like you‚Äôve somewhere to be urgently, even if you don‚Äôt have somewhere to be still look like you know. Back when I lived in NYC i‚Äôd always look directly ahead, if there‚Äôs people infront of you, still look ahead just focus on something that is still ahead but behind the people. Try to not make eye contact whatsoever. Literally no matter what don‚Äôt make eye contact. Also a tip that helped me was to always look angry. Not like super angry but always look a little pissed. Have a rbf always helps. People won‚Äôt wanna mess with you most of the time if you looked piss. Also don‚Äôt look clueless. 9 times outta 10 people will look for others that look like they don‚Äôt know where they are or what they‚Äôre doing. Just always look like you know what‚Äôs happening and be aware of your surroundings 24/7. Better to be safe then sorry. Also look calm but also not. Don‚Äôt be biting your nails or being anxious. It‚Äôll just make you more vulnerable looking to predators. And we don‚Äôt want that. Long story short I‚Äôd say to just always look prepared and ready. Always have flight or fight in check. The world is a scary place, always have to be prepared.",
