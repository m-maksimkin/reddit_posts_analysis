This is easily known by putting your hand up to any supply vent (vents that push out air into your home).\n\nIf this is the case, then it's a good bet that the levels of Freon (also known as coolant, refrigerant, etc.) in your your air conditioner are not where they should be.\n\nOccasionally, you could have an air conditioner that has too much Freon, which is causing your system to freeze up, but more than likely you do not have enough Freon circulating through your system, which is causing your air conditioner not to produce cold conditioned air to your home.\n\nIt is a common misconception that every so often, one must add a little more coolant to your system, not unlike topping of the oil in your car. But this notion is false. The coolant in your air conditioner system actually operates in a closed loop, meaning there is never a need to add more coolant... Unless there is a leak.\n\nLeaks are caused by holes, sometimes as small as a pinhole located anywhere where the refrigerant circulates. The size of the hole determines how long it takes for the Freon (which is actually a gas) to slowly leak out of your system.\n\nIf the leak is small, it may take years for the system to lose enough Freon to where your air conditioner is noticeably not producing enough cool air in your home.\n\nLarge holes will ensure the refrigerant leaks out much faster. Sometimes charging up a system, and spending hundreds of dollars to do so, is the wrong approach, as the Freon will only leak out days, sometimes weeks after it has been recharged.\n\nIt's always important to have a professional HVAC technician determine where the leak is occurring, and how large the leak is, before regarding your system.",

You can can a decent fan for as low as $20, where as AC units are in the hundreds. The thing stopping people from \"upgrading to an air conditioner\" is they just can't afford it. Not only the base cost of the unit itself, but the electrical bill too.\n\nNext time you should really think before posting something so foolish sounding. I really can't beileve how many upvotes this post has received. This really goes to show that we are just evolving backwards, figuratively of course. The average person nowdays seems a lot more unintelligent than the average person 20 years ago. Social media has not only been affecting our social lives (by isolating us from society), but also making us less inteligent as a species. \n\nThis is truly a sad sight, seeing the masses listen to buffoons like you rather than actual intelligent people. We truly are in a downwards spiral. For example just look at how mindless people are at concerts now, all holding up their phones and recording it, just to share the video on their instagram instead of actually enjoying the live music they paid to see! Or how texting and driving is now a major cause of death. \n\nSocial media and cell phones have always had a negative effect on society, we just didn't notice it until it was too late. People wont stop using it now, it should have been stopped 10 years ago. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, all isolating people from their true friends and family, just to replace them with fake online friends who have no emotions. \n\nI could keep going, but this topic is probably too much for your tiny brain to comprehend.

I have also perfected my fan system. I have one exhaust window fan at one end of my house near the stove and one intake window fan in the bedroom. All other windows are closed unless it's really nice out. Once the sun goes down, both fans are turned on and that displaces all the air in my house in about 30 minutes. Turn them off in the morning and close the windows to retain that night air. Plus they are much cheaper to run.",

(Typical Africans are comfortable with levels of heat that non-acclimated persons find intolerable.)  \n\nDuring the first two weeks without air conditioning I experienced lots of sweat -- so much that I always carried a drying cloth with me to remove sweat from my skin.  After around two weeks however, a big change occurred.  The excessive sweating stopped...and to my amazement every thermometer I looked at had become broken!  I would try to estimate the temperature, then I would look at the thermometer, and be stunned to see my best guess was around 12 degrees F lower than what the thermometer said!  I would think: \"It feels like 70 F in here\", then look at a thermometer and be stunned to see it read 82 degrees!   And the level of heat I could tolerate and still be able to fall asleep rose up to 92 F!",

In addition we put in modern low 2E windows and plantation shutters which makes about a 15 degree difference from the old windows alone. We have ceiling fans that circulate the cool morning and evening air quite well.  Thus during those 2.5-3 months we put one window air conditioner in for just those months and only have to run it in the afternoons.  When evening comes the air cools down and the circulating air keeps us quite cool until the next afternoon.

Which feels like an AC to the point I have turned it off. One of the benefits of mountain life.\n\nSide note: With good insulation, it's better to keep windows closed during the day. As it increases the time to equalize with the outside temps.\n\nAlso, shades and blinds also help reduce heating via windows. So knowing old  school techniques can further increase comfort, and reduce costs.\n\nOn days off, another thing I do is have cold meals for left overs. So I don't add heat from the stove. Microwave meals are also a good idea.",

Take said hand, raise it with flat and fingers together like the way you would wave to the friends you wish you prob had and then you wave it really fast in front of your face. Watch for the eminent danger lurking as you accidentally smack the hell outta your face. To make the face slap more comforting you may apply liberally apply a non Asbestos containing baby powder, possibly lavender scented, and get it good on your hands. Also remember to start with left hand to begin baby powder application as well. I believe they call this a pimp slap in some cultures btw. The hand waving close to face method if done correctly will hopefully generate some form of air dispersal towards your face area. This is the all organic man made, American fan. Ancient Chinese secret huh? That's the old french method. Specific hand use is most importantly to be focused upon when attempting. I think it's also free, but surely organic. Hopefully.
