Take the tub and place it in the microwave for 1 - 2 minutes to reduce the butter/marg into a liquid.\r\n\r\nPour this liquid in to an empty receptacle, such as a bowl or glass, and put it to the side.\r\n\r\nNow, take the empty butter/marg container and defecate into it. Once this filthy task is complete, pour the liquid butter/marg on top of your defecation, replace the lid, then place the butter/marg back in to the fridge.\r\n\r\nSoon, the butter/marg will re-solidify, completely hiding the deathly secret you have laid withing. Your hapless victim will start using the butter, until one day, as the level recedes, they start scraping a peculiar substance out of the tub that is definately not butter. Cruel isn't it?\n\nhttp://poo-butter.urbanup.com/1715742",

He constantly came in last.  But at the first tournament, he met one of the “big name pros” (I’ll leave his name out but he had a catchy phrase that he would always with his hands when he sunk a put.  He would use his pointer finger and thumb to make a gun shape and shoot at the hope).  Anyway... this big timer told my uncle that all the pros were having a secret meeting on the 9th green at 9pm and he was invited.  Told him to wear something nice.  Well when my uncle showed up... no one was there.  He was confused until the clock struck 9 and the sprinklers turned on.

As a 17 year old my first thought was to try to fight the dude but he was kind of nerdy and weird and it wouldn’t do much besides get me in trouble.  One of my friends apparently played video games with him frequently and searched up his steam name which led to us finding some of his accounts on weird anime porn forums, catplay and lolis and other stuff. \n\nWe set a plan into motion making an account on one of the forums to reach out to him as a catgirl cosplayer a few cities away. I would message him back and forth daily and he was falling for the made up girl quickly. We wanted to make it more realistic so my friend, a pretty attractive girl, would send him selfies and videos through the kik account and would skype him on occasion. While they would skype i would text her through another phone telling her what to say to make everything match up. \n\nAfter about a month we set up a “meet up” and he took the train 2-3 hours to the next city. He tried to call her asking where she was and I answered the phone basically saying his girlfriend was fake and he shouldn’t have talked shit. He didnt show up to school for 2 weeks and when he came back he tried to get me expelled for it. \n\nDefinitely fucked up but when I was a teenager I wasn’t thinking very well.",

THis is how I get over it, shut that door at long last. Just publicly and severely reprimand them, dress them down.Stephen Gee...Stephen muthafuckin' Gee. Synonomous with Betrayal in my mind. I think top 5 most embarassing, worst moments I'd ever experienced, this one really ranks up there, it was so incredibly hurtful/scarring.I'm not the funny, goofy guy I was...I'm the surliest motherfucker even I've ever met. People know I'm fucked up in the head...why? It's because of people like you, you were a direct cause of my toxic demeanor, one of a few pieces, that further made my youth miserable even after/outside of HS.Let's go into detail of how horrible that day was. Bear in mind...I got fuckin' Dan Adams, fucking with me because I didn't like him stealing my fucking candy bar, running into me in hallways, shit like that...I got vandals throwing beercans through our windows at our house, paintballing the sides of our house, kicking in the fenders on our cars doing $thousands in damage. These aren't pranks, these are hateful terrorist acts against me and my family that you people derive laughter from.And to add to all that...I got fucking Steve Gee making me into a public spectacle. I use to like you...but after that day, I might fake liking you, but I hated you every minute and hour after that incident, it was purely an act. I intensely hated you, righteously so, I'm not the one who's wrong here. And btw...no one likes me, I was tormented so bad...I am very surly, I'm constantly pissed all the time at just the absolute saturation of shitty acts....I was no saint, but so many shitty acts by so many shitty people, this was one of the cruelest institutions with just the shittiest people, and the shittiest adminstrators/police, shitty student body, and no, some of these acts are so egregious, \"boys will be boys\" doesn't rectify it.One guy advised that I turn to God. One said \"get over it\". How come no one ever recommends \"That's really fucked up...James needs JUSTICE more than anything else\"? You didn't face any punishment...I been fucked worse for traffic tickets.No one wants to hear it...they'll unfriend. Ghost. They just write me off as some unhinged crazed angry guy...but I didn't want to be that guy, you people fucked with me so bad it was entirely expected and without my consent, and you got so much entertainment out of it. A classmate recently reached out to me...but when he realized that I will be sharing these stories, he quit associating with me, because they're all debbie downer stories that you people forced on me. And it's all just further isolate me.Let's talk about this: I was in the lunchroom. I got a lot on my mind and my plate, with the vandals, and big shit for brains brute Dan Adams being an underhanded piece of shit because I didn't like him stealing my fucking candy bar with his stupid shit eating grin.I think on some level, you knew full fucking well I was an autistic SPecial School District K-12 child...and specifically because of that you targeted me for this torture, I made the perfect mark.And Steve Gee is with the popular older boys...and calls me over to the table. They're all happy and excited to see me. Steve was nice, he'd never betray me, right? I guess the lesson here was don't trust anyone, this is a prison culture made to look like a school.\n\nHey I want you to roll this quarter that i put a pencil ring around, down your nose and drop into it. And I trusted you, and I did as instructed. And there was a lot of silent giggling. And a crowd started to form. Eventually maybe 60 kids. And finally, Crystal Benford, a true friend walked up, and said \"James, you have pencil marking all over your face\". And then entire lunchroom erupted in raucous gutteral laughter, yourself included Steve.I wanted to cry I was so mortified...but that would just be further embarassing. I waited til I got home, and I cried I was so incredibly embarrassed, I hated you so much. I looked in the mirror \"Maybe blowing my brains out is better then trying to get a stupid high school diploma if this is the constant fuckery I have to deal with and the school administrators for doing jack fucking shit to stop sports athletes from this behavior\". This was a prison culture.Later on it got so bad, I wound up just outright impaling a guy with a pencil in his hand I was so pissed at no one standing up for me and this behavior that I was constantly given. Actually I got suspended for violently standing up for myself, the assailant was left to heal from his wounds but still attend class. I don't know how to communicate this is entirely intolerable behavior, outside of violence. Because nothing else was working.They educated me and gave me a heavy dose of mental scarring and social ostracization... that student body, school system, adminstrators, police, just pure trash. And to this day they ostracize for pointing it out. No one wants to associate with me. I recently started regular phone calls with a old high school classmate...he ghosted me. I'm too much of a debbie downer...it's because of this shit...you are a specific reason why I am fucked in the head to this day, and people don't want to associate with me...and I'm made out to be the bad guy for this.I don't think I ever socially recovered from that. SUppose a girl liked me, and she saw that public humilation, she wouldn't like me anymore...who wants to go out with that embarrassment? Even into college, that was always on my mind...that COULD happen if I socialize with my peer group, I can easily be nothing but the most heavily of betrayed.You ever watch the movie Carrie Steve? You know what the catalyst was that lead to her murdering her entire HS class? It was her standing in a room where they're all laughing at her at the same time. THink about that.If I Ever have a kid...I will go above and beyond the call of duty, that they don't turn out to be an absolute underhanded piece of shit, like the Steve Gee's, Stephen Pearce's, Kyle Marshall, Dominik Chekoudjian's, Marcus Dash Smith's of the world. THese are just terrible people, I guess their parents flat out fucking failed at raising children if I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt, and I'm made out to be some kind of a bad guy for bringing their crimes to light, that's truly fucked.I hope there's a \"Who was the SHITTIEST classmate towards James Stewart\" award, maybe you could be a contender for it, wear it proudly if need be.I suppose now was as good a time as ever to share this story...I made a healthy amount of \"fuck you money\" over the Winter Break from some investments.\"",

Two of the guys were cool and were part of the large group on the floor that hung out together. \n\nThe third guy wasn’t a bad dude, he was just super awkward…zero social skills. He pretty much kept to himself and went home most weekends. He claimed to have a girlfriend back home but no one really believed him until one weekend she came up to visit. She was just like him, pretty heavy, awkward…quiet. \n\nMy two friends who lived with this guy crashed elsewhere on the hall for the weekend as the thought of these two scroon 8feet away was too horrifying. \n\nThe weekend passed without incident and no one thought about it too much…that is until the following weekend. As he usually did, the awkward dude went home for the weekend to visit his recently verified girlfriend. For some reason, we all decided to get shitfaced on Sunday evening. For some unknown reason, awkward guys two roommates decided to go through awkward guys stuff …and found the sextape. \n\nApparently awkward couple had so much fun the previous weekend they decided to spice it up during the week with a little phone sex..which they recorded. \n\nIf you think that two people talking to each other about sex in baby voices while using horrifying nicknames for various body parts is hot….it isnt. It’s awful. So awful that my buddies decided they needed to put their speakers in the hall and blast this shockingly cringe sex tape for the entire hall to hear. \n\n30 years later I still feel bad for laughing as hard as I did, laughing that is until awkward guy came walking down the hall, his face a mask. He walked into the room, turned off the stereo, put the tape in his pocket, turned arroubd and went back down the hall never to be seen again. A couple of days later the RA boxed up all of his shit and shipped it home. Hope the guy recovered from this.",

We then proceeded to walk to the nearest 7-11 and place the purse in one of the three phone booths outside of the store.  We sat back across the street and waited for some poor, unsuspecting victim to discover the treasure that lie within.  About 30 minutes went by and sure enough a guy rolls up to the last  phone booth and picks up the receiver before looking into the next booth and spotting the purse.  He immediately switched to that stall and grabbed the phone while he looked around to see if anyone was watching.  He unzipped and started digging through the toilet paper on the top that my friend used to wipe with.  His hand went deeper and you could tell that he knew he had made a mistake.  He slowly lifted his hand to his nose and took a whiff.  At this point we all busted into uncontrollable laughter.  He glared hard at us and threw down the purse before storming off.  The next morning, one of the same friends woke me up to walk him to the store to get a pack of smokes.  When we arrived, we found the purse had made its way around to the side of the building and that the two by four my buddy dropped was still inside.  We placed it back in the same phone booth and my friend lit up a smoke.  A few minutes passed and a pair of girls we knew came walking up.  I asked, “Hey, did one of you leave your purse in that phone booth?”  They both said no but decided that they should take it into the store and give it to the clerk just in case the owner returned to claim it.  We watched through the glass as the girls explained to the clerk what they had found.  Then perhaps the funniest thing I have ever seen happened, they decided to open the purse and dump its contents out to look for identification.  This huge log tumbles out onto the counter in 7-11 and both girls start screaming, “EWWWWW!!!!  EWWWWW!!!!”.  The clerk is now ready to kill them both and yells at them to get out of the store.  He sees us standing outside the window cracking up and I knew we had to get out of there quickly. Needless to say we steered clear of that place for a while.  Anyway, extremely cruel but I still laugh my ass off whenever I tell the story.  Maybe I’m just an asshole…",

She told us about a week before our own grad, a warning not to mix alcohol and hard drugs.\n\nThis is all I know. \n\nWhen she was in high school, just after her class graduation ceremony, and a couple weeks before the end of the school year, a classmate of hers was engaged, set to be married very shortly, within days. I'll call him Seth.\n\nSeth was also set to attend university out of town in a STEM field and had already secured a part-time job. He and his to-be-wife were to leave for the university town a few days after the wedding. He was 18.\n\nThe night before his wedding, Seth's friends held a Bachelor party for him. They thought it would be a great idea to get him both highly intoxicated *and* prank him by putting LSD and Heroin in his drinks. They literally used a syringe to inject Heroin in his alcohol glass.\n\nThey did, and Seth unknowingly became high, drunk, euphoric, and paranoid.\n\nThey then put Seth on a Greyhound bus. They thought it would be funny for him to wake up on the bus having no idea what happened and late to his own wedding.\n\nHis friends thought it was something they and Seth would all have a good laugh about the next day at the reception.\n\nIt didn't happen like that.\n\nSomehow, Seth had a rare, but extremely bad reaction, in part due to an undiagnosed heart murmur, between the alcohol, LSD, and Heroin. \n\nThe drugs caused Seth's brain to \"fry\" and his heart stopped. He was rescuitated, but was never the same. He would never recover. \n\nSeth was taken to a psychiatric facility, where he will remain for the rest of his life. My teacher said he spends his days drooling, staring into nothingness, cannot speak, or take care of himself. He is aware of nothing. Everything that made Seth \"Seth\" is gone. He does not remember the Bachelor party, that he was engaged, his family, nothing. \n\nThe wedding, of course, never happened. Seth never went to school, worked, or was able to do anything he was planning.",

He described it as really fucking bad and disgusting, literally the good old fishy smell. So we were hanging out at this friends place and I was like \" Yo, let me call her\". So we looked up the smart people way of saying your shit stinks bad and i called her, basically pretending to be a dermatologist and telling her that he told me. So i \"diagnosed\" her with some type of fungi down there and she bought it like 100% and even asked where my office is so she could come in and get it checked irl.",

There was one kid who was actually really good at the sport. He got pulled up from JV to Varsity our sophomore year. He wasn’t very social. He was a yes sir, no sir type of kid. The seniors at the time looked at him as an ass kisser weirdo. A lot of the seniors at the time didn’t take the sport serious, and usually just goofed off and got high before practice or games behind the locker room. They decided it would be hilarious to prank this kid by all of them pissing in his glove and hat, then leaving it in the freezer in the club house over night for it to be discovered frozen the next day. He was told that the glove and hat were just dunked in the toilet, then frozen after. But this kid knew they had all taken a piss in it while it was sitting in the toilet; I was that kid. The stench of the hat glove were disgusting. I can only assume they felt the need to do this because I was two grades behind them and better. I was taking playing time from a lot of them because I was better at the sport. So I take it they saw me, a younger kid taking the sport serious, taking playing time from them, and they wanted to put me in my place. No one ever got in trouble. I was an anti social kid that didn’t like being in the center of attention or having any spotlight on me. So I never said anything to any staff or my parents. I took advantage of the situation and used it to get a new glove. I went to my parents and made up an excuse that my glove got water logged and I needed a new one. I already knew what glove I wanted. A glove I had always dreamed of getting. The Wilson A2000. My pops and I went to the store that day and he got it for me. I still have that glove to this day. \n\nOh, and I started taking all my gear home with me and leaving nothing in the clubhouse. There was no way I was going to let the seniors do what they did to my old glove to my brand new baby Wilson 2000!",

At the time of this I think I was like 8 or 9 (I wasn't that old yet but I definitely could've known better) and I was staying at a coastal town for a 1 week class trip. The boys and girls in our class stayed at separate rented cabins with bunk beds and all and I think they were both 1 block away from each other.\n\nWell I don't remember exactly if we had gone out to do some activity earlier in the day but I remember us girls being bored af in our cabin, with nothing to do and with shitty weather outside.\n\nI was sat besides the window on the 2nd floor just racking my brain thinking of what I could do to cure everyone's boredom, no one was in the mood for games and this was the early internet era.\n\nI had the following conversation inside my head (yes for some reason I speak to myself with \"we\". I know it's weird):\n\n\"what could we dooo??\"\n\n\"hey, why not create some drama to at least get people talking?\"\n\n\"There's nothing to talk about.\"\n\n\"k, why not make something up to get reactions out of people? It's gotta be something good...Oh! Why not prank them?\"\n\n\"and tell them what??\"\n\n(this is where I fuck up)\n\n\"Make up something scary, that'll be fun. But tell them something dumb that they're not likely to believe at first. Tell them that *you saw a man with a knife walking around the cabin*, that'll definitely cause some drama\"\n\nSo yep, little me did just that (facepalm). I put on my best acting face and spread those lies to the oldest among us, who then told the teacher. Other girls overheard and panic and fear began setting in (also it was beginning to become dark) and the teacher began to interrogate me, getting more and more concerned by the second.\n\nI was dragging it out and gave descriptions of \"his height\" & \"his jacket\" thinking about how no one was bored now & my plan was succeeding until the teacher said something about being sure and calling the police and that's when I realized how much I had fucked up.\n\nThat's when the other girl looked me in the eyes and said \"Don't lie. Did you see something??\" that's when I knew I had to end it. So I ended up owning up to my lies, (to the anger of the teacher and a few other girls) and I spent the rest of the day being ignored and given the stink eye (understandably)\n\nThought the story ends there? Not quite.\n\nThe less \"mature\" girls among us were already afraid for their lives (even though I had already owned up to my mistake) and the people that didn't \"mistreat me\" (10 or so girls) were crying hysterically about how they wanted to go home and how they didn't want to lose their parents (this makes me feel disgusted in myself :'( ) . Lots of them spent a sleepless night consoling each other and worrying, all because of me and my \"need to cure our boredom\"\n\nSo yeah, younger me was a heartless dumbass and it shames me to no end :/\n\nWorse part is I felt bad that one wanted to be friends after that and thought things like \"Bruh, these people can't even take a prank. What, did they actually think that they were gonna die?? What a bunch of idiots\"\n\n\\------\n\nNote: If you've read this and know who I am, for what it's worth I'm so sorry!! I promise that I don't pull shit like this anymore xD\n\n**Tldr:** I made a cabin full of 6-10 year old girls think that they might get murdered all in the name of a \"prank\" and \"curing boredom\" (I was also about that age when it happened. I'm not a monster!! At least not anymore I'd like to think)\n\nEdit: wtf 73 upvotes? Thanks guys! I really wasn't expecting this :)",

Oh well, collateral damage is a bitch, eh?\r  \n\r  \nAs for that second exception? Well, most of the time the horrible fecal expulsion is its own punishment...but I wanted this asshole to suffer, literally.

My friend had a massive crush on a girl in our class at that time, and knowing you only have enough blood to think with one head at a time-I improvised my best impression of this girl, stringing him on for half the day before inviting him to see some god awful movie later that afternoon.

He ended up buying a ticket and searching the theatre for a decent bit of time before calling the number instead of texting it.

Not really proud of it and hardly ever talk about because I was a teenager and it was over 10 years ago but here goes what I can remember. \nFreshman year, I was dating this guy M that I was really into. That is, til he dumped me. I started to flirt back with this guy friend of mine T that started flirting with me once I was single. I already figured T had a crush on me before but he was always respectful while I was in a relationship with M so he never flirted or made a move before. This was just a “rebound” though because I wanted to get back with my ex, and after a few days, M agreed. But before he would officially take me back, I had to play this “prank” with him on my “rebound.” \nM’s idea was to pretend like we hadn’t made up yet and then while I was sitting with T, he came up to us. He asked if the seat was taken (which was obviously taken by T) and then before waiting for an answer, he was like “eh, fuck it” and leant down in between us and kissed me. But what *I* thought was going to happen was just M coming up to us and say “Hey, she’s with me now” and then I’d get up to leave with him. But apparently, M decided to switch it up and improvise without telling me. Poor T was just like “Whatever, man” and he got up and left as everyone else laughed (M’s friends were close by). I sat there feeling like shit, but was laughing along because I wanted to fit in with my boyfriend and my new (his) friends. \nMe and T later made up when I explained and apologized. He was such a chill guy and didn’t hold it against me even though he definitely should’ve.",

The girl came to my private chat and said that it was a prank but to keep it going on. I said ok and then they said something abt going on a date. My friend (F) said what was he supposed to do and G suggested that he can be a third wheel but B said no thanks (even though it's a prank, it's understandable) and then some stuff went abt that and then F said that he was really upset about it and he started crying.

The girls would put hanna through hell and say sorry. I think she stuck around because she wanted to be \"popular\" or something? Not sure\n\nBut at the end of the day hanna left and she hadent continued to the next grade next year\n\nThe girls did \"disband\". One left and two are here but they dont talk so maybe that was karma?\n\nTl;DR: girls are cruel to one another, they are even cruel to their own friends",

So after a particularly exerting session I stumbled into the kitchen to get hydration, all covered in sweat and various fluids (Ahhh...to be young and in love again.) I already knew just what to do. Giving myself a good wipe down with my hands, I mixed it all up with the cookie dough and stuffed it into fridge on a plate.

So we all think it’s this girl but we are all keeping it to ourselves. Until this one guy walks in, who wasn’t here all day, goes into the bathroom, sees the test, and yells “OMG who is pregnant??” The girl who we thought was pregnant cries and runs out of the party. Everyone is like holy shit we were right, but the girl who put the fake test in the bathroom was like “wtf?”  She told us that the test was fake and didn’t know why that girl freaked out. Later on, we figure out that the girl who freaked out and left was actually pregnant and found out the night before. Super unfortunate timing for a fake pregnancy test. The girl who put the test there had no idea that the girl was actually pregnant, just awful timing. \n\nTL:DR. Fake pregnancy test ends up outing an actual pregnant girl by accident.",

It was posted and scheduled in advance. My friend and I liked to \"remind\" eachother in the halls, loudly that it was half day, when it wasn't the right week. People would get excited and happy then after lunch they'd see me and remind me that I was an asshole for getting their hopes up. Priceless and a harmless prank. \n\nOne week we did this and I guess the right people overheard. A few kids parents were bus drivers. They called their parents to remind them it was a half day. Somehow it snowballed and at 11:30 buses had parked out front of every school in the district and they had to cancel the other half of the day because the bus service drivers were pissed to find out they had to cancel their plans for no reason. \n\nPrincipal called me and my friend to the office and said he knows its our fault, but no one fact checked it and so it wasn't really our fault. He smiled and sent us on our way to enjoy our half day.",

(Seriously less than a month before) Fast forward a couple of months and me and A join a little \"friend group\" that was semi-already formed, but now everyone who was in that group at the beginning has left except for us, and now there's a lot of new people in the group. Anyway, later on, a week before the two-year mark of her dad's death, one of the freshly new kids to the group, let's call him B, texts me asking if I can somehow find the photo A took of her and her dad on the last day he was alive. I ask why and he says that he wants to do something sweet for her to make her smile a little bit on the day, so I say yes and find the photo while I'm at A's house and text B a picture of it. Come the day, he comes wearing the exact outfit her dad was wearing, with one of those wigs on that just shows a fake hole in the head and a bit of brain popping out.

I came to school late that day because some idiot hit my dad's bumper on the way, and when I came to school I saw A crying in the bathroom. I tried to coax her out but she was a fucking emotional mess (who wouldn't be) so I basically went to all her teachers and told her that she wouldn't be able come to class and why, and I just collected her homework, then called A's mom and explained the situation, told her to pick her up, and went over to her house after school to help her with homework/talking her through it.",

Luckily the girl who was the victim talked to him really calmly and explained to him that it wasn't something nice to to do and that the kids who seemed nice were actually being mean to him.\n\nEdit: As I recall, the kid’s teacher wanted him to go back to eating lunch in his class but lots of students talked her down and there was never another incident.

The girl who was “pranked” was really a popular and successful student and while I didn’t know her (she was a couple years ahead of me) I knew enough about her to say with confidence that she had a great career ahead of her. Don’t think anything happened to the football players.

I didn't live there long but this was the worst prank I can remember.\n\nOne of the guys from the group was absolutely trashed and ended up passed out on the couch. Its his house, so maybe we should draw a dick on his face or something before we go home, right? Nope. A couple of the guys maneuver him so he is hanging over the end of the couch, think doggy style sex, and pull down his pants. Then one takes a 2 liter pop bottle, puts the top against his asshole, and punches the end of the bottle hard. Essentially taking his virginity with an empty 2 liter of coke. We then leave him there and head home. I headed back to my province the next day, and didn't hear anything about the fallout until almost a year later. This poor guy didn't say anything to his friends, went into a deep depression, attempted suicide, lost his job, and spent almost a year in therapy because he was raped during a party at his house. No one knew about any of that. No one said anything because they all assumed the prank failed and he woke up none the wiser. \n\nThe truth only came out a year or so later because the instigator started laughing with him about this great prank they played on him when he passed out drunk at the party. They aren't friends anymore, and you better believe I don't party with any of those guys when I go out to visit family.\n\nEdit: Not sure if it's important or not, but I forgot to mention the used condoms they left on his back.

I ended up deferring university to do this play and off the back of that play I got scouted by another director to be in another production that was going to start in my home town and then go touring.  In the first show I met and dated this girl - Jenny - that was in hindsight way out of my league.  We're going out for a few months, one show wraps, I go onto the next one and then after another month or so we go touring.  We get to our first city, perform the show for a few weeks and then due to a number of different reasons of low ticket sales and disputes among the producers, the plug gets pulled and I'm back home.  I call up Jenny telling her the good news that I'm back and ask her what she's up to that evening.  She says she's got some 'stupid dinner thing' she needs to go to but says it's going to be boring and all that stuff.  I say that I'll come along and keep her company.  She tries to discourage me, but I really want to see her and eventually she says that it's at her friend's place and gives me the address.  I offer to swing by and pick her up beforehand, but she says she's going to be over there early to help get things set up.  That should have been alarm bell #1.\n\nThe place turns out to be a waterfront mansion belonging to the owner of a professional sports team.  Turns out Jenny was good friends with his daughter.  I drive up and the front driveway is littered with BMWs, sportscars - all more impressive than my humble sedan.  It's a house party full of rich kids.  I say hi to Jenny, but she's more distant than usual, but she's flirting like crazy with other guys that are there. People are mostly out by the pool, in the hot tub and sauna.  She doesn't introduce me to her friends, so I introduce myself and it's awkward because I'm being judged the whole time - they're asking who my parents are - expecting them to be important business people or socialites, what kind of car I drive, where I live, all that sort of stuff.   I grab myself a beer and start wandering around the mansion.  There's a game on in the large screening room downstairs.  A couple of other people are there but give me a wide berth and then after a while I'm absorbed in the game and barely notice them leave.  There's a couple more unopened beers down here so I crack them open and drink, feeling utterly miserable for Jenny not wanting me there and kicking myself for insisting on coming along to see her.  Out of beers, I head back upstairs to the kitchen to grab another and whilst I'm there I hear this pounding sound.  I also notice it's quiet and everyone's disappeared.  I follow the sound down the hall coming to the door out onto the pool and next to it the sauna room.  There's a pounding again from the sauna door, I look down to see the door locked in a makeshift way with some string tying the handles together.  I use my keys to saw through the string, slide the door open and there's a girl standing there naked and embarrassed in front of me.  She grabs her towel and wraps it around her, thanks me for opening the door and asks me if I can help her find her clothes.  We look down past the pool deck and notice that the pier at the end of the yard is empty - everyone had fucked off on the boat leaving the two  of us alone in the house.    We look everywhere but can't find her clothes - those asshole rich kids had either taken them on the boat or tossed them somewhere.  I offer her the top shirt I have on over my t-shirt, though eventually after combing the mansion for a while we find a laundry room and she grabs another shirt and a pair of leggings to put on.    Luckily they'd left her purse next to a couch in the living room.  I asked her if she wanted me to call her a cab home or I could give her a ride, but I'd probably need to wait an hour or so based on the beers I'd consumed.  She's happy to stick around, grateful I was able to let her out.  I should point out the actual sauna had been turned off before the assholes left and there was ventilation, but it was just so cruel.  We sat around chatting for a bit, I found out her name was Mary and she was a cousin of one of the asshole rich kids and her aunt forced her to bring her along.  I told her my story then feeling sufficiently sober offered her a ride home, which she took me up on.   Turns out whilst I was watching the game, these kids had all gathered in the sauna, nude but for their towels and gradually slipped out deliberately until Mary was the last one in there, turning off the lights, extinguishing the heat and just leaving her there with the sliding door handles tied.  \n\nI drop Mary home and then head home myself.  I get a string of texts from Jenny the next day trying to 'explain' the situation, but I'm having none of it and I don't even respond.  Eventually she calls.  I ignore the calls until finally the constant ringing is driving me nuts so I pick it up and yell at her.  When I ask about Mary, she says 'it wasn't her idea' in defense.  I tell her not to call me again and that we're done, and then as a final act of spite on her part tells me how she was cheating on me with someone else while I was away.  I got a quick little acting job overseas not long afterwards and then came back and resumed my studies, putting acting on the backburner for a while.\n\nTL:DR: A bunch of rich kids having a house party played a prank on a girl by locking her in a sauna room and then went off galivanting in a boat.  I discovered her after also being left behind in this big empty house.",

More pictures, she’s still faking smiles and trying not to seem ungrateful even though her feelings were hurt.\n\nWe start the traditional clean-up and our mom is poking at my sister, asking if she’s happy that she got everything she wanted.

Our mom was a good mom and never made our adopted (at birth) sister feel like she wasn’t part of the family. And she would occasionally pull little pranks that resulted in “surprise, you actually got what you wanted.”\n\nBut my sister was/is so sweet.

Ok, sure. Might as well give it a shot.\n\nQuickly worked out that we had nothing in common, very different personalities and interests. She’s very brash and loud, and constantly wants to start arguments. We didn’t really work on air, but she didn’t know how to work the equipment and knew that if anyone was going, it was her.\n\nOne day while a song is playing, with the mics off, she starts talking about how she can’t cope at home; dad is nowhere to be seen, mum’s an addict, she’s working two part time jobs as well as the radio just to keep a roof over their heads. Says that killing herald might be the only way out, then runs out of the studio crying her eyes out. I’m dumbstruck, thinking that I’ve got her all wrong. I end up playing four songs back to back wondering if she’s going to return. I now don’t want to say anything on air without her, and I’ve lost all momentum for presenting.\n\nSuddenly the lights in the opposite studio come on, and through the glass I see her and her friend laughing their heads off. Said they wanted to see how awkward they could make me feel, and how long I could go without being on air. I was furious. Locked her out of the studio, finished the last hour of the show on my own, and afterwards demanded to speak to the station manger. Girl apologises, but I say I can’t work with her anymore.\n\nThey move me to an afternoon slot, and she stays on the breakfast show for another two years. She goes through 6 male presenters in that time, and at no point did management think she was the problem. The whole station went under after only 4 years of operation.",

There were legitimate concerns that our entire computerized network would crash and nuclear weapons would become uncontrollable and sentient. In the charismatic Christian world, the [Left Behind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Behind) series was a legitimate best seller; attracting people of all walks to consider what our world would look like if all of the Christians suddenly vanished. For those that don't know, the Left Behind book and film franchises is about the rapture- the time predicted in the bible where all Christians are whisked away to heaven before God releases waves of famine, war, and plague on the world and whatever humanity remained. Also, the devil is in charge. It's a big deal in the world of Christians, especially the ones who really do blend fantasy into reality and treat life like it's a constantly running RPG. These are the people who don't go to college because God is going to come back any minute, so why waste all that time and money on worldly pursuits.  \n\n\nMy friends were part of a large family with five children so their home was the default meeting spot because nobody knew what was going on over there. They were charismatic Christians and attended the kind of church that would have at least a drumset on stage and usually also a smoke machine. So, this whole end of the world and imminent rapture message is ringing from the pulpits of their church and the middle child, Andrew Michael, is eating it up. He was a high strung lad, cerebral and artistic but also truly anxious. He was the kind of kid who questioned why we did anything at all when we were just going to die eventually anyway; at six years old. By the time he was twelve, he pretty much played piano, worried, and tried to stay out of the way of his brothers. His brothers and cousins were typical American suburban kids, riding bikes and playing games and generally paling around like healthy growing boys, which also made Andrew Michael more of an outcast, alone in his room with his books and keyboard.   \n\n\nEvery once in a while, the boys' parents would leave the house and the patients ran the asylum. This is when all of the cousins, friends and brothers who were home at the time would change their clothes and leave the old clothes in piles on the floor in places that they were occupying originally. They would quietly slip out of the door and go somewhere else. The last one to leave would blast an air horn in the home to signal that the rapture has happened and Andrew Michael was the only person in the family who wasn't called home to sit at Jesus' feet. No matter how many times this happened, Andrew Michael came un-fucking-glued. He would have a nervous breakdown and run down the street to his aunt's house, literally hysterical that his entire family was gone and he was left alone in the world that was fixing to be run by the devil himself. \n\nIf he was lucky, his aunt would be home to calm him down and reassure him that no, the rapture didn't happen, and the world is still moving right along in anticipation of the second coming.",

I don’t think I have ever been so angry with someone in my life. If it hadn’t been for the weird behavior of the cops outside I probably wouldn’t have fallen for it, but somehow those two things together made it feel like the world was actually ending.",

Look out my front window and see my \"friends\" pull up (it was high school, I didn't understand the concept that you don't have to hang out with people you don't like). \"Damn I didn't know they were coming, I bet they wanna hang out\", I thought. I open the door and my friend put his arm around me, which was an automatic red flag because he never did that. He then grabs me from behind and holds me, another kid sprayed me IN THE FACE with a fire extinguisher, while a third kid filmed it. They all just laughed at me, posted the video online to all my other friends and left, never apologized, or hung out with me. Most of my other friends realized how fucked up it was and said it was wrong but none if them really did anything about it. I had to flush my eyes for 20 minutes and take a long ass shower. Luckily I didn't suffocate but it did get in my mouth and nose and near my eyes. Thank fucking god my parents weren't home, my dad had terminal cancer at the time and I didn't want him to see that happen to me right before he died (and yes all three of them knew this). Also, it didn't even occur to my dumb ass until two years later that I could have gotten them all arrested for attempted murder. At this point I don't even care, and I've forgiven one of the three, but every time I hear something bad happened to one of them since then, I don't feel bad. Fuck them. They are actual sociopaths. I think it goes without saying I've lost contact with two of the three and the one I'm still in contact with isn't very close with me anymore.",

He will stand by you and not buy anything. Both times not talking, just being there. \n\nWell one day me and another friend needed space to discuss something personal and he is following us during the free period. We ask for some space and he just won’t give it.\n\nSo while in the library, I found a few health books (puberty, sexuality, a few National Geographic’s with topless women) and hid them in his backpack when he wasn’t looking. \n\nWell we go to leave and the library security alarm goes off as he passes the detector. Me and my friend keep walking and the librarian stops him. He is trying to follow us and the librarian has to yell and chase him down (getting the full attention of everyone in the library). \n\nI found out later that when she got him to come back he was yelling / crying saying he didn’t have anything and was combative. Everyone is watching him and the librarian checks his backpack. \n\nShe finds the books / magazines and says she will check them out for him. He is still claiming he didn’t do it / he doesn’t want it. By the time she finished, he can’t leave for the last five minutes of the period. So he is just standing there crying both embarrassed and unable to follow us. \n\nWell the people closest to the exit see books and bust out laughing.

He mocked all of our moves, he ran around us in circles, and the teachers all thought it was part of the act. It wasn’t until halfway through and some pretty awful laughing/jeers at our expense that someone pulled him out of our formation. We finished our routine, and I left the assembly in tears. I passed one of the gym coaches on my way to the locker room, he stopped me and asked what was wrong. When I told him what happened he said something to the effect of “at least the kids enjoyed it.” As if our hard work and passion meant nothing. The kid didn’t really get punished. And at the end of the year when they did the senior poll about favorite things of senior year, there was an overwhelming vote for that incident as the Funniest Moment. I even had a friend on newspaper staff who knew it was going to upset me, but didn’t bring it up. That was a kick on the gut.

He was a veteran, so there were knives, bullets, you name it, all of it was in that room. It was essentially a room in memory of him, and my aunt made it very clear we were to never go in there. My sister had a friend sleep over one night, and she was a terrible, terrible kid.

I ate a piece of bacon that was left over from dinner and she told me she let the dog lick it before I ate it. Just truly a horrible child. We were upstairs, playing together in me and my sisters room, and she ran into my late uncles room. Me and my sister immediately went in there and told her she had to get out because no one was allowed in here. My sisters friend closed the door and essentially held us in there. She would take the knives out of the sleeves and say if we tried to leave or get away she was going to kill us with the knife, and she even put the knife up to my sisters neck. We were stuck in a room with a psychotic child. I was so young that I dont remember exactly how we got out of the situation, but we eventually did, and as soon as the morning came I ran downstairs and told my aunt everything.

I was visibly confused looking at them like why would I be? They said they saw me running away from that man while he was chasing me with a knife. I respnded with that wasn't me, you're mistaken, I don't know what you're talking about etc. For some reason though, they kept swearing that it was me, and they were sure, so (initially to shut them up) I just went with it. I thought it would end there, I was wrong.\n\nThe next day they were telling this story loudly enough so I could hear, and around me to other people, which then got also involved and started asking me questions. The day after that, they saw me again being chased by this guy, this went on for a couple of weeks. I just went along with it, (to my shame,) because for the first time ever, people were including me, talking to me, being kind and made me feel like a part of the group.\n\nEventually teachers caught on that these stories were going around, did some research, actually spoke to this guy (that I still never even seen) and explained to the entire class that this was a religious thing, and that he was harmless. I felt so ashamed, humiliated and disgusted, I wish I would fall through the floor and just die on the spot. During the break they were all ganging up and laughing at me, saying things like 'we can't believe you fell for that, look how stupid you are! Omg you thought that was real?!' When I started to cry they laughed harder.\n\nSchool was not fun for me. I feel really bad for going with that, especially for that man that did nothing wrong.

We used to jab each other between the ribs, unclip each others bags so that they'd fall off their shoulder, tie each other's shoelaces together, that kinda stuff. So one time I secretly unclipped my friends bag strap (it was a duffel bag type thing) and clipped it to her earring. I don't know how she didn't notice but as the bell sounded to head back to class, she stood up...and the bag strap dropped. \n\nI freaked out because I had just torn my friends earlobe, my mum always warned me of the dangers of earrings but I didn't listen. She also freaked out at what I had done. Then we realised her earlobe was fine, her earring had just come undone. \n\nHonestly, I have no idea why the fuck I thought that was a good idea but needless to say, I didn't fuck around all that much afterwards.\n\n2) I used to attend week-long camps in the summer. There was usually at least one couple that formed from it. This one camp, there were two guys (let's call them Riley and Cameron) who obviously had a crush on this girl (let's call her Layla). Each person had an envelope with their name on it stuck to a board, and during the week everyone could write little notes and stick it in other peoples envelopes. \n\nAnyway, this time I attended the camp with my \"friend,\" and at the last day of camp when the leaders made a call for any last minute notes, Layla was dating Cameron. My \"friend\" thought it would be super funny if she wrote a note from \"Layla\" to Riley saying \"sorry you didn't get me.\" I knew this, and didn't stop it. The leaders were told about it once everyome was allowed to open their envelope and everyone was given a stern talking to. It's one of the reasons I lost faith in humanity",

Sorry for the length in advance.\n\nThere were these two girls (Let's call them Marissa and Terry) in my grade. I was good friends with Marissa and she was one of my close friends I made at this school.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Marissa began dating this guy who had a reputation in school as being a dick and something of a womanizer. It seemed like every couple months, he had a new girlfriend or fuckbuddy he was seeing. Apparently, Marissa and this guy broke up (don't remember why, dumb high school reasons probably), and after they broke up, this guy began messing around with Terry literally within a day or two of the breakup. This infuriated Marissa and I guess she wanted to get back at her.\n\nI should also mention now that at this time there was quite a juicy and nasty rumor going around school about Terry that apparently followed her to this school. Allegedly, she put peanut butter down below and had her dog lick it off. Obviously no one could confirm, but rumors are rumors and they spread regardless of truth or not. Especially at a tiny boring ass school in a tiny boring ass town like the one I was living in.\n\nAt this point, Marissa and this guy got back together, but I guess she still wanted to get her revenge. So a few days before we went home for winter vacation, Marissa told me to hang out by the water fountain for a minute. Told me to \"watch this\". She had a white holiday gift bag in her hand and she walked up to Terry who was coming out of her science class.\n\nMarissa feigned kindness and told her how sorry she was about everything and that she hopes that they can move forward and be friends. She told Terry that she got her a Christmas present as a way to make up for it. My heart skipped a beat because I had a bad feeling about what was gonna happen.\n\nTerry was beaming and seemed so happy that Marissa apologized and was actually giving her a present. She went through the bag and it was a Golden Retriever Beany Baby, a big jar of Skippy peanut butter, and a plastic spoon. She took this stuff out in front of everyone in the hall and Terry started sobbing. I remember her calling her mom and saying something along the lines of \"They know here too!\"\n\nI was disgusted with Marissa and didn't talk to her for about a month or two after that. Don't know if that counts as a prank, but it was definitely one of the meanest things I've ever witnessed.\n\nKids are cruel.\n\nEdit: Added a couple of sentences",

            "text": "Cruelest prank I ever saw may have been witnessed via the first-person perspective.  Tl;dr is that I convinced my roommate her boyfriend had HIV and a few other STIs for about an hour.\n\nSo back when I was going in to my second year of college, I had rented a house with some of my friends, two of which (M and D) moved in over the summer while the rest of us went back to our families for break.  While we were at our respective home cities, M and D got up to quite a few shenanigans, many of which were documented and sent to all of us.  Now, something to know about my friend group is that we were all kind of weird af (still are, but were too) and, when you couple that with the fact that our house had no AC and it got balls-sweatingly hot that summer, meant that quite a few of those shenanigans involved little to no clothing.  In general, the school I went to was pretty bohemian, so to speak, and we all ended up with a bit of a loose relationship with the need for clothing, but M and D (as well as other friends they had met) were just a bit ahead of the curve on that.  None of these shenanigans were all that scandalous, mostly just ridiculous and involving a decent amount of stupid videos in leopard-print jockstraps.\nAfter we all moved in together and started getting used to the ever-increasing amount of weird shit college kids get up to, it came out that Ds girlfriend (who lived with us as well) had, at one point in the summer, begun to suspect that D was cheating on her with M and that there had been sexual activity going on.  This fight had, apparently, at one point escalated to the point of Ds gf asking if D should get an STI test to prove nothing had happened.  Eventually it all blew over and even D's got admitted she had been overreacting and in the wrong.  It even became a bit of a joke among us all that she would laugh at.  Now this is were I got an idea that maybe went a little over the line.  And by over the line, I mean way too fucking far and by maybe I mean definitely.  But I was young, and dumb and thought I was being a comedian.\n\nSo I found a picture online of a sample drug test and (very shittily) mspainted it into an STI test, saying that D had HIV and some other ones like chlamydia and shit.  Not that I'm some graphic designer, the regular print still had references to drug tests and the values were all in parts per million, so enough that even a close inspection would show it to be fake, but not a cursory glance.  I knew that Ds gf was getting home from class that day and D would be getting home from work about an hour later, so I dropped it slightly open on his desk and went to me room.  When she got home, she found it,  and came to me asking if I knew what it was.  Being the shit that I am, I responded 'I mean, I know what it looks like.' and she went back to her room to what I can only imagine was an awful hour until D got home.  D did arrive a little later, which I could tell by hearing the front door open and his signing of some song as he put his stuff down and went back to his room.  At that point things got real quiet for a few minutes before I hear him shouting 'KURTRUSSELSMUSTACHE, YOU FUCKHEAD!'\n\nI burst out laughing and they both come running in to my room to throw some shit at me and smack me around a little bit.  Everyone was laughing about it and it became yet another running joke in the house, but still as I grew up a little I started to realize what a real, actual fuckhead I had been.  It was super cruel and, even though we (D and his then-gf-now-wife) are all still friends, I still profusely apologize every time the subject comes up.\n\nstill funny as fuck tho.",

            "text": "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.\n\n\nThe industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.\n\n\nIf the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.\n\n\nWe therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.\n\n\nIn this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.",

He had a really close friend who we'll call Zed. When my then-boyfriend started spending all his free time with me, Zed got jealous that he didn't have his \"wingman\" anymore. He was getting laid regularly by a girl who thought they were dating, but he wanted to hit on random bar sluts with his buddy. So he and a girl who hung out around our friend group, who we'll call Mary, made up a fake text conversation to try to convince me that my then-boyfriend was cheating on me. The plan was that I would break up with him and he and Zed could be wingmen again.\n\nLuckily, my husband has some intense trauma around cheating because his dad cheated prolifically on his mom, and as a result has a zero tolerance policy for cheating. That in itself would have cleared his name for me, but the original fake text thread didn't have dates, times, numbers, or names anywhere. When I pointed that out to Mary, *and she added them in and tried to show me the same texts but with the changes I suggested*, they chose a night where I know for a fact that my then-boyfriend was with his mom at his aunt's house, and I had Snapchats from his sister proving it.\n\nWhen confronted, Zed said it was a prank. He wouldn't admit it was a shitty or even not normal thing to do, even after my then-boyfriend asked how it was funny to break him up with a girl who he was planning on marrying, or why it was even necessary since I encouraged him to go out with his friends.\n\nNeither he nor Mary were invited to the wedding, and we have it on good authority that neither of them have changed one bit.",

This was a Christian private school, yet still a lawless environment where the usual was most students  ganging up on someone else just so they’re not the victim that day. Somehow word got around that I had a crush on Dana, and during lunch period she came over and sat next to me, and started lightly flirting with me. I suspiciously asked her about her ex Justin, to which she replied confidently that they were “really over this time, and it’s time to try something different”. My thoughts were put to ease when she began to cuddle up next to me, and eventually hold my hand under the table, and after lunch was over, hold my arm talking while we walked around waiting for the bell to ring. Any suspicion I had eventually fell away to a shocked state of puppy love. I thought to myself, I’m really holding the hand of my crush, and everyone is cool with it.... wait... what about Justin? Was he really cool with it after all, or was she just saying that? Another student asked the same thing, to which I overconfidently defended against with something like “it’s obviously too late now” and walked away with Dana on my arm. Soon, the bell rang, and we walked towards the double doors, only to see Justin turn the corner, lock eyes directly with me, and raise his arm to point to me. Nearly half the school stopped to see Justin briskly walk towards me, never breaking eye contact, and bring his fist back to a punch. He was maybe 6 inches taller than me, so he used this to his advantage to grab the collar of my shirt, pull me in for the blow, and aggressively say “DUDE.” Dana had broken off my arm at this point, and I closed my eyes to prepare for the hit, simultaneously attempting in vain to break free from his grip.\n“DUDE. Look.” \nI frantically opened my eyes to realize the fist inches from my face had sharpie letters writing crudely, saying: “U GOT PUNK’D”\nthe whole school laughed, Justin smiled, dropped my collar, and walked away, Dana following close behind. I was completely dumbfounded that everyone was in on the joke but me. I was the punchline. Literally. \nThe next period was scheduled to watch “Jonah” the veggietales movie, which was a good movie, but I spent the entire time on the edge of the row, trying my hardest to pretend not to care, all the while trying my hardest to comprehend why anyone would do something so cruel. \nThen I remembered cause it’s fucking middle school. \nI looked them both up a while ago after telling\nThis story to my current partner, and Dana is married and Justin... definitely peaked in middle school.

            "text": "I was thinking of a Japanese show I watched where they rolled a cannon into somebody's dorm while he was sleeping, and then fired it to wake him up, but then I remembered  something that actually happened to me long ago.\n\nWhen I was in junior high, one day right after school we were outside waiting to be picked up by our folks because in my country and at that school it was common to wait outside the school doors for your parents to get you. I was hanging with several friends when a lady I had never seen walked up to me with one of my schoolmates, and asked me at what time should she pick him up, only to get what I assume was a blank expression from me as a reaction to what she was saying. \n\nThe lady was the mother of a kid in my class, a loner, that type of boy that would've been called a nerd, a weirdo, a sissy or what have you in those years and by other kids. He had no friends, he looked sickly, and perhaps wasn't entirely happy. He got picked on by other kids, and years later I found out he suffered from epilepsy and was medicated constantly, apart from being borderline challenged. The afternoon before that day, one of my friends called his house pretending it was me to invite him to my false birthday party, and so his mom showed up at school to thank me for inviting him. She was told that someone would pick me up, along with all of my friends, and taken to my house for my party.\n\nIt took her a moment to understand when she saw I was completely confused about what she was talking about. I can never forget that the range of expressions that went through her face, in only a moment, showed the realization of what was going on, sadness, and frustration for having fallen for this kind of thing again. What I could never understand is what she felt when she tried explained to her son why there was no party and that everything was an extremely unpleasant joke. How do you explain that to a kid in his condition?\n\nI was 14 or 15 at that time, and so my only reaction was to get upset for a short while with my dumb friend for pulling that sick joke off. I forgot about it and only remembered about it years later. I was glad to learn, even a longer time after, that L. went on to marry and have kids of his own. \n\nI hope you found happiness, L.

You are not supposed to inhale cigar smoke. You suck it into your mouth and blow it back out, and the nicotine gets absorbed through the blood vessels in your mouth. The smoke is not filtered and if you try to inhale the smoke you will probably vomit, especially if you don't smoke tobacco. \n\nSo I yell at my friend's who is staring at the trees, \" your turn, come hit this\".

            "text": "This may get buried, but it definitely stuck with me over the years so I might as well share it: Right after I graduated with my Bachelor's, I worked in Japan teaching English at junior high and elementary schools. At the junior high school level, I would partner with the team of English teachers at the school I was assigned to and we would work out the curriculum/daily lesson together.  I rotated between various junior high schools about every six months or so.  \n\nRight before one of the times I switched, I had just gotten the notification of the new school I'd be working at and one of the other teachers came over to tell that husband works at that school and he's an English teacher, so we'd be working together.  This teacher, X-sensei, was very pleasant and well-liked by the students, so I figured that her husband would be similar.\n\nSo I got the other school and... the husband was not well liked, and he was not pleasant.  Y-sensei would tease his students in English.  He'd say to the girls, \"You're pretty!\" and then, after they started to giggle nervously, he'd add, \"Pretty ugly!\" and walk away laughing loudly.  The students knew they'd been insulted, but they were never sure how to confront him, or exactly what he'd said.  I was flabbergasted that he'd treat students like this and didn't know how to confront him, either.  (This was only about a year into my teaching career and I was still very much finding my feet.)\n\nI have other stories about this guy (he was a pain to work with, until a certain point), but I've always thought the cruelest prank he pulled was mocking his students in public in a language they didn't 100% understand.  (And I couldn't understand what a lovely woman like X-sensei ever saw in him.)",

You know the ones with the big wheels. Not the little rollerblade wheels, but the big wheels. I had ridden my friend’s quite a bit, so I knew I needed this. \nIt took me months to save up. They were a pretty penny for a 10 year old. \n\nFinally the day came. I knew the next pay check I would get would tip me over the amount I needed to by this pimpin white scooter.  I gave the money to my parents, and they said they would pick it up while I was at school. \n\nAfter school I was so damn excited to take my new ride for a rip. I sprinted from the school bus, jump our fence, and our bushes, ran into the back yard where my parents and a few family members, and family friends were hanging out. Bright eyed and bushy tailed, I liked all around the yard and couldn’t see it. They all knew what I was looking for. I looked to my mom, like ‘where is it!?!’ And she said they didn’t have any left and wouldn’t be getting any more in until next summer. \n\nI was fucking crushed. They all laughed as a stared into the distance completely deflated. I was 10. I had now idea how these things worked.  They waited for the tears to start falling before wheeling the thing out of the garage. By then the experience was lost on me. The lesson? Who fucking knows.",

Being the young horny fucker I was, I reciprocated these remarks and exposed some pretty sincere stuff about how I found her attractive and so on. Nothing sexual but I was definitely prone to vulnerable exposure. \n\nOn the way back home I told my friends and suddenly got a call from her and was convinced to answer. As I answered I heard my voice on the car speakers and immediately realised that I was texting my friends the whole time.

The prank was initially supposed to last a while, and my friend was to put stuff under her shirt to make it look like she was 'showing' but the reaction prompted me to discuss the matter again with my friend, and we decided to tell her it was a prank, but we couldn't decide how. We roped in another friend to help us, and as we were walking down the hall in deep thought,  the couple came into view, and the girl had revived and relaxed.

So these people hatched a plan to \"get him to shower\" so that he would \"smell a little better\". Allmost the whole class was in on this. They would fill a flask with water and bump into him thereby spilling the liquid onto him. They pretended it was some sort of dangerous chemical (Maybe acid, idk that was a long time ago) and put him under the emergency shower.\n\nAll of this was pretty bad, but the worst - at least to me - was that our teacher was (probably) in on it.\n\nI later realized that he probably had some sort of trauma from his previous school where he was also bullied pretty badly.\n\nI really hope he is doing better nowadays.",

And so on, and so forth.\n\nHigh on our antics, we skated back towards my mate's house - who needed to replace his dad's video camera before he got home.\n\nNearly there, we arrive at a choice...\n\nWe can skate along either:\n\n* the pavement (that's \"sidewalk\" to ya'll 'Muricans), or,\n* the brick-paved private, narrow road, that runs in-front of a row of retirement homes\n\nQuickly realising we'd arrived not at a choice, but an obligation to be unruly, myself and my mate (one with the camera) walked around the back of the retirement homes, to the other end of the brick-paved street.\n\n\"OK! GO!!\" we shouted to our mate. And off he went. Him, laughing his ass of. Us, watching, laughing our asses off, as the sound of his skateboard making an *almighty* clackety-racket, as he skated past the retirement homes.\n\nThis was far too funny to do just once.\n\nSo we sent him back, to get a shot of him doing it from behind. For the art.\n\nStruggling at this point to see, with so many tears of laughter in our eyes, we called our friend back towards us one last time. Only this time. The prank went bad. For him.\n\nHaving barely passed 3 houses, a man burst out from the front door of one. He was *enormous*. Unable to stop in time, our friend *clattered* into this Norse God of a man - his skateboard crashing into his shins.\n\nSeemingly immune to the impact, this man grabbed our mate by the scruffs of his black, oversized Nirvana hoodie, and lifted him up to his face. Their eyes now level.\n\nThe look of sheer, unfiltered *fear* that immediately engulfed my friend's face was a look that - to this day - I have not seen since.\n\nImmediately: spews of the most *fervent* apologies started gushing from his mouth. Repeated yelps and gasps of, \"sorry! I'm so sorry!\" couldn't leave his mouth quick enough.\n\nAs for me and my friend filming it, we laughed harder than we ever had before.\n\nThe sight of our friend, hoisted by the scruff of his neck, by a man larger than all of our dad's combined, pleading for forgiveness was one of the fucking *funniest* things I have ever witnessed.\n\nIt was a cruel prank. It was cruel to skateboard loudly past a row of retirement homes. It was cruel, perhaps, of the angered man to react with such a disproportionate level of aggression towards a 12 year old.\n\nBut you know something, folks? I wouldn't change any of it for the world.",

Dude was to be \"randomly\" selected for the half court shot to win a chunk of money. The switch was that he was going to do it blindfolded. So the audience was told that when he made the shot, assuredly a miss, they were to go nuts like he sank it. Prank went off like a charm and the mascot comes over to present the check. Dude was super happy until the mascot removed the costume head and he saw that it was Bro and knew instantly it was a prank.\n\nBro was going to a baseball game with his girlfriend. Dude's revenge was to go ahead of time and set up a \"will you marry me\" prank where the camera picks them out and has her name attached and everything. Cue really awkward discussion between Bro and the GF.\n\nI figured if things kept going the penultimate prank was going to be like one of them hiding a corpse in the other's trunk and two months later showing up at the state pen to tell them \"GOTCHA!\" through the glass barrier.\n\nOr the whole thing was BS.

In the group, there were always two guys, Dusty and Tim, that got the butt of pretty much any practical joke. Everyone liked them, everyone just liked messing with them. \n\nWell, one day after school Dusty was walking to his car and as he was walking across the parking lot, a white van pulls of next to him and two guys in ski masks get out and put a gun to his head. They then put a sack over his head and push him into the van as another guy slides open then door. The van then screams out of the parking lot. \n\nInside the van, Dusty was hog tied with bungie cords while still forced to keep the bag over his head. The next thing he knew the van lurched to a stop and two guys carried him out of it and into a building. They then carried him downstairs. \n\nOnce he was downstairs, the masked men took the sack off his head and told him to strip. Dusty could see he was in an old basement but nothing looked familiar. When Dusty refused to strip, three men approached him and forcibly started removing his clothes. Dusty was pinned to the floor by his shoulders as guys yanked off his jeans and then his underwear. At this point, Dusty kicked out and caught one of the guys square in the faced and he could see blood start to gush out from under the ski mask as the guy started cussing. \n\nOnce the masked guy started to swear and grab at his nose through the mask, Dusty realized that the guy he kicked was our friend James. At this point, the masked guys knew he had made them and so they all took off their masks and it was all of our group of friends minus myself and one other guy. Dusty had broken James' nose and James deserved it. At that point, Dusty thought the prank was over but he was wrong. \n\nNow that he was naked, they smeared his body in Vaseline and then wrapped him from shoulder to toe in Saran Wrap. His \"friends\" then hung him upside down from an exposed rafter in the basement and took pictures of him. \n\nAfter they had done this, they let Dusty go and told him that if he ever ratted on them, they would print out the pics and put them up all over school. \n\nDustin never said a word about this to anyone until he told me about what the other guys did to him almost twenty years later. I then asked the guy that got his nose broke if that was true and he admitted they had kidnapped dusty and he still had the pictures. He also let me know the gun was a real .22 and it was loaded when they took Dusty hostage. I asked him why they had to use a real and loaded gun to do that and he said that it wasn't scary if the gun wasn't loaded. \n\nIt turns out, they did this to my other friend Tim as well but instead of hanging him naked from a basement rafter, they stripped him and made him bob for apples in the toilet of the abandoned house with the basement. They took pics of him too. \n\nTim did tell on the group and all of my friends but me were suspended. They also put the pics of him bobbing for apples up everywhere when they came back to school. \n\nI knew that Tim had been kidnapped because I found out when everyone got suspended. I didn't know about Dusty until years later. I was never asked to participate in the kidnappings because everyone knew I wouldn't go along with it so they didn't bother.\n\nTLDR: Late 90s highschool friends kidnapped a couple of other friends at gunpoint and made them do embarrassing stuff as a joke.",

I stopped hanging out with him after this.\n\nSo there's this girl in our class that was quite unpopular. Not because she was mean, or even ugly (I actually thought she had some cute features to be honest), but she was misunderstood. She was a bit eccentric but she was actually a very sweet, kind, and smart girl. She never had boyfriend's and she was made fun of alot. I always went out of my way to try to protect people like that and would actually bully the bullies when I had the chance. Beat up a couple of them actually, one for making fun of a Amish girl for not having a TV at home and was actually making her cry. Anyways...\n\nWell at some point my buddy in the class overhears this girl talking with her only two friends in the school when I wasn't there and she tells them she's madly in love with me.\n\nCut to the next day in class and without my knowledge my friend wrote her a note posing as me and told her I was madly in love with her. Not just that but a full page of sweet things that he knew she'd want to hear and gives her the note in the morning. A few hours later during the class she came and sat next to me and started up the conversation. Filled with joy saying how she never thought it'd be interested in her, that she thought I didn't even know she existed. \n\nI was bewildered, and I looked at my friend and he's holding back laughter. I see the note in her hand and I motion to see it. After I read it I didn't know what to say and I'm sure my expression didn't hide the fact that this letter that had given her exactly what she wanted was not real. I had a steady girlfriend I was head over feet for. So I say I'm sorry but I didn't write this, I tried to be nice about it and I say I like her but not in that way. I try to let her down easy but she's crushed, tears come pouring down and she runs out of the room crying hysterically.\n\n My buddies is now laughing his ass off, the teacher gets involved and demands the note. Everyone in the class now knows what happened and the worst part is everyone thought I was in on it because we were jokers. I felt so bad for her, I tried to apologize to her numerous times. Let her I know I truly had no idea he was going to write that and if I had known I would have stopped him but she was too heart broken to hear it. Poor girl never got over it and she would go on to not be able to even look me in the eye the rest of our time in high school. \n\nI was furious at my friend I called him every curse word I knew at that time and never really looked at him the same.

I’m sitting in my uni class and get a call from new manager, which is SUPER unusual (I had asked him to not call me during my uni hours unless it was urgent, but text was okay). I step outside and answer call, he says “you need to come into work 4pm today.” Sounds super angry and refuses to elaborate. Mind you, it’s 10am at the time. \n\nSo I get to work at 3:45, early for the good impression. Manager pulls me about 10m away from my work colleagues (not into an office) and proceeds to publicly fire me. I’m completely stunned, speechless and knew I should argue but I was trying to hold back tears and a panic attack. \n\nI get up and nod, am about to walk downstairs to HR lady when he starts laughing and telling me it was a joke :(",

We worked for a cellular company so every time I had my number changed “Jimmy” I would find it. Every time we’d go out for drinks (usually as a group) jimmy would call bartenders and order a drink for me (found out later this usually cost him 20$ plus the cost of the drink to do.) Jimmy would leave handprints on my windows and lipstick kisses, love notes scrawled in crayon under my windshield (lived in same apartment complex) It never ended and I even went as far as to file a police report several times. My coworker would almost always use public phones to do anything and I’m pretty sure the police never took me serious as a 21yr old guy complaining about a stalker. It was elaborate as can be. Then after almost 2 years of this  continually growing stalking it stopped. During a shift my coworker looked at me did the “Jimmy” voice and told me since this weekend was his wedding he figured it was time to stop. So 2 years of panic and looking over my shoulder and going crazy and paranoid and just like that it was done.",

I called up his roommate and asked him when was the last time they went to their favorite bar and other details to suggest I was there. Got my buddy to write a super creeper stalker note with many details about his last bar visit. It was very sexually aggressive. Woke up early one Monday for work and decided to drop it off on his wind shield before work. Wait for him to come into work and let everyone else in on the prank. \n      What I didnt know was that he had been at his parents house all weekend and I caught him in this 20 minute window he was home before work. He immediately thought it was his roommate, so the prank almost flopped before it got off the ground. \n     Wait another week and get specific details, from him, about staying at his parents house. I had been there once before when we did a group bike ride around town, so I knew where they were. The night before my day off, I drove to his parents place and slipped another note on his wind shield. The next morning our coworkers were texting how he was freaking out. His roommate called me and said he was scared shitless and I told him I would reveal the prank the next day at the beginning of work.\n      An hour later his roommate calls me again saying he told his roommate it was me, thankfully. He was so freaked out, he called his parents and they asked their neighbors if they could check their security cams. One neighbor had my car, which is the same color as his roommates car, on camera and they were gonna give the footage to the police. Luckily my coworker called his roommate before the cops got involved. \n     I called him up immediately and apologized and offered to come apologize in person to his parents, but he said it wasnt necessary. I was worried because one of our coworkers who had recently retired, got arrested for stalking because he sent anonymous threatening letters to a bunch of our bosses. In the excitement to prank my buddy I had totally forgotten about our now jail bird retiree and could have possibly faced a similar situation.",

I mentioned that it would suck to be pushed over whilst inside and then shortly after this guy I was kinda friends with called Pop Punk Mike announced he was going to use said toilet. The penny dropped as he shut the door and me and another friend called Gav just looked at each other, as soon as I saw the look in his eye I knew what was about to happen. I'm not even sure what possessed Gav because I'm pretty sure he didn't even know Pop Punk Mike that well but he just bolted like a speed demon straight toward the toilet and slammed into it pushing it over. The group was pretty awestruck by this sudden act and in a mixture of hysterics and shock when it dawned on us that the toilet had been pushed onto the door trapping Pop Punk Mike inside. Feeling merciful I ran closer and pushed it onto it's side so he could open the door and saw a scene I will never forget. The door flung open and out poured a tsunami of swirling blue fluid carrying chunks of turd that had been roasting in there over the weekend. Not a moment later the shit demon formerly known as Pop Punk Mike emerged and clambered out sweeping aside his poop coated hair to reveal a look of vengeance. I was the first target, presumably because of my proximity and previous comment but fortunately I am pretty spritely whilst the shit and piss weighed him down sufficiently for me to escape with ease. After he realised he wasn't going to catch me he made a b line for the group seated nearby and still awestruck, some of the slower ones weren't so lucky but Mike the Pop Punk Shit Demon lost his footing, at this moment I chose to retrieve my bag which was in the danger zone but that turned out to be an ill fated error. I grabbed my bag easily enough but as I made my get away I felt a warm poopy hand grip my ankle, pulling my foot free from his sloppy grip was easy enough but the damage was done. I had shorts on so a quick hose down after I made my escape and got home did the trick but that sock and shoe were never going to be the same again. Gav got away clean, the bastard.\n\nJust to add to the hilarity of the situation the entire park was in hysterics throughout, I felt very bad for poor old Pop Punk Mike but funnily enough he tried to steal the olympic torch years later so I guess that was backwards karma.",

            "text": "tl:dr at the bottom\n\nSo this was about a year ago, summer of the pandemic, we're all in college, Trump is still president, which actually plays a pretty important role in this story. I was planning to go camping in the Outer Banks with my best friends, we were all really COVID conscious but were desperate to get our of town as the lockdowns were starting to ease at this point. Two of them would be with me the entire time, but one of them happened to have had a trip already planned at the same time with some really old friends from childhood that he saw a few times a year at most, quite a bit farther south down the coast. They were staying a weekend, we were staying a week, so we decided after we found out he was simultaneously having this trip that he could meet us at our camp after he was done with his other friends. So halfway through the first weekend we get a call from the friend that was going to meet us later. He doesn't really say much, just he's coming back up the coast to meet us early and that he doesn't know how long he's going to actually stay with us. When he finally arrives he looks horrible and we can tell something fucked up happened, we are all in sobriety so my first and most immediate worry was that he had relapsed with these people, that's how shaken up he looked. Now I want to mention, my friend is extremely smart, he's a Mechanical Engineering major, and has an internship at Rolls Royce making and designing jet engines, with some sort of standing job offer depending on how the rest of his academic career goes, my point being this is an incredibly sharp and logical dude. But he does have anxiety, like really really bad anxiety, it's something he's definitely come to have a really good handle on over the years, but if you know this guy, even a little, you're probably at least somewhat aware of this, so his childhood friends would definitely have been aware. Last thing I want to mention before I get into the prank, he is one of the most kind people I know, the definition of \"a good guy\" like, you're talking to someone and you find out the other person knows him too, first thing either of you are going to say, is that \"he's just a really really good guy\". I think I've hyped him up enough, so I'm going to get into the prank. Once we briefly catch up with the understanding that he's really flustered about something  we ask him why he came up to meet us early, and so he tells us. From how I understood it the other three guys he was with were a lot closer to each other these days than he was to them, and that this was a pretty elaborately planned out prank with a lot of little details and the three dudes all acted if out flawlessly. That morning, after staying up really late he was shaken awake by one of the friends he was staying with, immediately he heard a loud buzzing alarm noise, and the two other friends shouting at each other in the next room over whatever this alarm was. The friend that woke him up started yell at him that something horrible was happening and he had to get up, so he bolts out of bed and follows the guy that woke him up into the living room where the other two guys are. When he walks in, he sees the kitchen light on, it's still pitch black outside, there's shit everywhere, they each are stuffing a backpack with clothes and whatever and they all look really really panicked. Most importantly the TV was on, I don't know if they found a video somewhere and based the prank around it or if they made the video that was playing themselves, but from what he told me it was basically a really panicked looking news caster yelling that tensions had boiled over between Trump and North Korea, they had launched their nuclear armory at America, and we had retaliated leading to China to join in due to their proximity to NK, with their better equipped missiles aimed at the east coast, mutually insured nuclear destruction was coming. Lots of panic, lots of red flashing lights, the weird alarm sound whenever the newscaster wasn't talking, and most importantly a count down that read about 15 minutes. Having just been violently woken up and given the global climate at that time and the severity of the situation had it been real, my friend abandons any question asking and any logical thinking and starts doing what he's told, which is to pack a backpack, they were going to drive as far south as they could. At this point he himself is either on the verge of have a panic attack or actively fighting one while trying to process the fact he and everyone he's ever known is about to die. One of the other guys that had left the room after my friend came in suddenly runs back into the room waving his phone which is on a call. His uncle was down here, he yells, he has a boat, it's eight minutes away already in the water and his uncle is here without his family, there's room on the boat. At this point the newscaster had left the desk after saying something along the lines of 'God save us' and there was just an empty chair, papers everywhere, a countdown, the alarm and flashing lights, there's 11 minutes, they had to go now. So they all run down to one of the guys trucks, and dive in, my friend has packed maybe a change of clothes and his medicine at most and is still wearing what he slept in. They start driving towards where the boat is one of the guys turns on the radio and there's something that sounds like a weather alert playing over it, except it's about the nuclear attack, at this point if my friend had any doubts he was about to die, they were completely gone, this was happening. He decides to call his mom and say goodbye, he does and wakes her up, she of course has no idea what's going on and panics, he tells her he loves her and to tell his siblings the same, she's freaking out and is horribly confused, suddenly he loses the call, they were in a really remote part of the OBX, this wasn't unusual but plays right into the prank, there's now no way for him to verify what's happening, and he thinks hell never talk to his mom again. He's now under the impression that his family is going to die, but he, by some miracle might survive. At this point he notices one of the guys is filming, so he asks him why, the guy tells him, somewhat understandably, that he wants a record of what's happening, this is after all unprecedented and world shattering. He doesn't really think much else of it, and they arrive at the dock. The boat is there, it's a small private dock, no one else is around. The uncle is waving at them to hurry, we got to go he shouts, they park the truck and run to the boat, they're on it in a minute, ready to go, the boat blasts off and heads for the open ocean, at this point they're still well within sight of land, but the countdown is completely up, nothing happens, they all quietly sit as the boat starts to get farther and farther from land, still, nothing happens. Maybe the bombs weren't going to hit this far down south, either way his family was definitely going to be dead because the liked within two hours of DC. The one guy is still filming everything, the uncle asks one of the other guys to hold the wheel for a second. He walks around to the front of the boat, which is maybe a 24' center console, and rummages around he comes back around the center console holding a couple of fishing rods, everyone including the captain, except my friend, starts laughing hysterically. My friend at this point is confused as he's still trying to process intense amounts of adrenaline given he's about to die, they stop laughing and explain it was all a prank, the camera zooms in on him sitting there dumbstruck and they all start laughing again, even the captain who was not actually anyone's uncle knew, he was just a small local charter captain. They had chartered a fishing trip, there was no nuclear war, the North East wasn't currently a smoldering wasteland, his family was alive, though of course now he definitely didn't have cell service to call his mom and explain why he just told he to get his younger siblings together and say goodbye. He was pissed he spent the rest of the charter trip freezing his ass off in his pj's and the inadequate change of clothes he brought and absolutely starving because he hadn't eaten breakfast and since it was a budget charter there was no food. There was no apology, they didn't understand how they had horribly exploited the anxiety of this super sweet guy for a funny video, or how they probably should have pulled the plug when he called his mom to tell her she was about to die (in fact they got a kick out of that because apparently it was the hardest part for them to keep a straight face through). When they got back to the beach house after the charter, he called his mom and explained, he packed up and left, heading our way. That night he couldn't fall asleep at all even though he was exhausted since he'd been up since before the sun and was emotionally drained. When he finally did he woke up having a panic attack and started throwing up right outside of his tent, we let him sleep in one of our trucks with the A/C on and he eventually fell asleep, he  decided not to stay for the rest of the trip and went back home the next day. I don't think he's talked to the childhood \"friends\" since.\n\ntl:dr-My friend with an anxiety disorder is tricked into believing there's a nuclear holocaust happening and calls his mom to emotionally tell her she's about to die and say goodbye to her and his young siblings and taken to a boat heading far off the coast so they can survive, 45 minutes of panic and anxiety attack later he's told they're just on a fishing charter and the guys he was with were just making a video for the lulz.",

He squirted mustard onto the floor and told the chef to go clean it up. Unknown to the chef was that the mustard was in the centre of a tied rope. Once the chef was in position, the cashier cut the rope, which was connected to an anchor. The chef was caught by his feet and thrown into the air. He was pulled through bags of flour, around support beam on the ceiling, and thrown into two walls. He was even pulled underneath the butt of a seated customer. Lastly, on his descent, the cashier placed a garbage can under him so he’d fall right into it. The cashier was laughing the whole time, but the customers and I just looked on in horror.

Some friends of mine decided to hide these eggs around our University campus one year the night before Easter, only instead of filling them with a pleasant surprise, they filled them with real egg yolks. They filled over 150+ eggs and then hid them all around campus everywhere but the main dining hall.\n\nFor reference, the campus was quite small, as the University we attended was a small private Uni with only about 1000 students. What was hilarious was that the University hid plastic eggs at the dining commons the next morning that were actually full of chocolates and candy. So people started their day having breakfast and eating candy from the plastic eggs, and made their way to class collecting more eggs as they went along. Only problem was that the eggs outside the dining commons were filled with real egg yolks.\n\nThe whole day, you just heard people screaming in surprise as they got their hands covered in egg yolk. This was around the time that Yik Yak was a thing and everyone was freaking out about the egg yolk problem. There was egg yolk in the bathrooms, in classrooms, on peoples' clothes.\n\nThe best part is that nobody ever found out who did it. It became something of a campus-wide legend.\n\nIt was a great Easter prank.",

Having dropped out of grade school due to poverty and family issues, he’d pretty much given up on that dream. He started working in a factory and only played here and there. Then one year at the ripe age of 22, he happened on an announcement for open tryouts with LA Galaxy. What did he have to lose? He trained as best he could and attended the tryouts.  A few weeks later, after a long day at work, he arrived home to a surprise party organized by my cousins. They gave him the great news that representatives from LA Galaxy called and that he made the cut!! He couldn’t believe it. He slumped on the couch, tears running down his face, reflecting on a life of challenges and joyful at this unbelievable turn of events. Suddenly the room erupted in laughter. “I can’t believe you fell for that!” spouted the ringleader.",

I didn’t like the guy, but I never understood why he hated me so much. Nevertheless, one day, I walk around the corner of a large set of scaffold and there he is moaning on the ground, nearly motionless, spitting out blood and mumbling incoherently. I yelled for my boss to call 911, and I tried to get him to open his eyes and let me know how badly he was injured. I was in serious crisis mode. Other workers gathered around but everyone else was frantic and clueless. I made sure no one moved his head or neck in case of a spinal injury, and I was doing all I could to help him. Then suddenly he stands up, laughing and pointing in my face about what a sucker I am.  I was stunned. But I didn’t feel at all stupid for trying to help him.  I was relieved that he was ok- despite what a bastard of a human being he was. I knew that I had done the right thing, even though he probably would not have done the same for me.

The goal after it got past 18 inches was to shave it off for donating to cancer.\n\nWell, at one science camp, a kid who lived at the end of my street was being a typical dick who tried to act like hot shit- you know, as far as a kid can be hot shit in the early 2000s at that age. He tried to convince me of shit like \"You can play as Superman in Super Smash Bros Melee if you jump directly under final destination 100 times\". Yeah huh. The dude just did not like me, and I didn't give into any of his crap.\n\nWhen my head was turned one day while sitting down for lunch at the camp, I could smell smoke. He had lit my hair on fire with a lighter and singed a good couple centimeters off the back until I put the fire out. This was indoors, so the smell (which I'm sure you're aware is atrocious), and he had not thought past this part of his plan. His reply when he was getting kicked out by the museum staff along with his mother was \"It was just a joke!\"\n\nI never talked to him after that in school or when he still lived on the street. Ended up cutting my hair to neaten it up and remove the damage, and donated my first time when I was 13.

Eventually he decided on a whim to go get a fertility test, and much to his dismay it didn’t come back so good...the doctor said he’d be hard pressed to have kids without artificial means. He was pretty depressed about it and I took him out for a drink after he told me. He was basically in tears and asking me how he should tell his girlfriend that he probably can’t have kids. I assume he was worried that she would leave him or something. A few days later he finally gets the courage to bring it up to her. Before he could, she runs out of the bathroom with a positive pregnancy test  joyfully telling him she was pregnant, which of course made my friend ecstatic. He immediately started talking about a nursery, baby names for both genders, etc. The girl played along for most of the day until he started trying to but clothes and supplies. Then she told him that she was sorry and it was a fake test to trick him. Apparently her cousin or someone else she knew was pregnant and they collectively thought it would be funny to mess with him. Our friend group all knew her friends didn’t like him much but we didn’t think they’d ever stoop this low. This girl seemed pretty cool and down to earth whenever we’d all hang out together, so none of us really saw this coming.  He left her that day and stayed in my spare room for a while before moving into his own place. The entire first two or three months he stayed with me he barely said a word or left his room for anything other than work. It didn’t turn out so bad, though. He’s got a pretty nice place to himself now with his own custom game room. We have dnd at his place every week and he seems to be doing a lot better for himself than even before that debacle.",

Two of us would sit on each side, we'd copy a question off a book in the middle, work on our individual solutions & discuss later. In our class, we had these two really special kids, both sort of bullies but one was different. One was smarty-pants who was really brilliant but made fun of everyone else for being slow, went to a posh school and the other was a typical school bully, with rich parents & money. \n\nOur tutor had left us alone for a small bathroom break. Anyway, rich kid thought it would be hilarious to hold a ball-point pen under smarty-pants when he stood up to lean over the table. Smarty-pants sat down and the pen went up one of his buttcheeks. Now, smarty-pants was pretty overweight and would always sit down with force, shaking the benches, so we'd never sit next to him. No one knew for a whole minute what happened and tears were just rolling down smarty-pants face. He had to be taken to a doctor later for stitches and the psychopath got kicked out. He had been laughing like a maniac the whole time, then wiped off the blood on his jeans and went back to solving his math. \n\nI ended up being in the same university as the psychopath, but thankfully never came across him (different departments).

Had this happen to me and my poor ass was so pissed that it was fake cause I really could’ve used the money. My friends bought themselves real ones and gave me the fake one to play a prank. We all scratched them at the same time and my one friend was like “man I didn’t win anything.” My other friend goes “I won a dollar so I guess I won my money back.” Then they all sat there in silence as I kept staring at mine in disbelief. I looked up and was like “ummm... is this legit?” They ensured me it was and asked if I won anything and I told them “maybe but I’m not sure, this can’t be real right?” Obviously my ticket said I won $10,000, but I had that shock of disbelief. Then my shock sort of went to happiness when my friends hyped me up and congratulated me. That’s when I turned the ticket around to find out it was fake. I honestly was mad, I had plans to take that money to pay my debt off. They all laughed at me as if it was the funniest shit they ever seen.

Looking back on it, some of his behavior (ie- through the pocket jerking off in math class) also pointed to sexual abuse.  He also had some serious ocd and maybe aspergers, dude made paper lists of everything- usually about which girls he wanted to do whatever with, but also things like his favorite kiss songs (fwiw this is waaay after kiss was popular).  Talked to himself almost all the time and had a wicked tick. Poor guy had some issues and had clearly already had a rough life.  \nHe lived with a foster family.  One foster brother acted more or less indifferent to him, but the other was a complete asshole.  I saw him piss all over him once, things like this were not at all uncommon.  It was just a continues stream of the foster brother doing mean shit to this kid.\nOne day this kid shows up with no hair or eyebrows.   Turns out, his asshole foster brother duct taped him to a bed (maybe naked, can't remember now) and shaved everything off.\n  I mean that's bad enough, but in the context of this kids life, that's the last fucking thing he needed to be dealing with.  \n  \n  I have no idea whatever happened to him, but its always in the back of my head that I'm going to see his name on the news some day.

Three guys in my class had plans to duct tape me to a pillar in the cafeteria on our last day of high school (which is when we're 15/16 in Sweden). Apparently some girls in the class talked them out of it. I heard about it years later when my social life was heavily improved and I wasn't a shy person anymore. Apparently some of my friends knew about it and didn't seem to think it was a big deal. Even still, at 27, my heart drops by the thought of it. I know that it doesn't seem like that much of a thing but I've always cared way too much of what people thinks of me, and having that done to me for the whole school to see the humiliation, man I don't even know. I suppose I've never viewed myself as a victim of bullying (and still don't think I was) and so it kind off struck at my percieved image. These guys where childhood friends that I had grown apart from during high school but still considered friends, which sort of just makes it worse. I'm really glad that I never had to experience that and hope to one day thank the girls who saved me from it. Not really sure why I haven't already, just feels shameful I guess.

It formed organically for survival. \nIn sixth grade we started football and this kid who had parents that owned a bowling alley (Ill call him BA)  invited all the guys to his house for a sleepover. Surge. N64. Call some sex hotline and hang up. Normal boring shit. I hated these kids and BA. I was, surprisingly good at football, and I remember thinking that I like deserved to go. I'll fit in. We all play football. Blah blah. \nI hadn't spoken to PK about this sleepover since we didn't talk about the other kids. Even though he played football I figured PK wasn't invited or wasn't going. \nGet to the party. Sleeping bags. Space jam posters. Finished basements. Potpourri. Entire team shows up. Even the lone Hispanic kid. No sign of PK. \nThree hours in Im sitting with no one, letting my tum digest way too much local pizza.  Doorbell. PK and his mom. She drops him off. He comes down to the living room. We make eye contact and both look confused. He looks scared, unsure. He parks his bag on the other side of the couch, away from me. \nThe kids didn't make fun of him. They didn't tease or poke him. They got him pizza. They gave him the phone for prank calls. Laughed at his jokes. Were interested in his ideas and thoughts.  Showered him with compliments and handed him drinks. It was insane. I couldn't comprehend what this was but I was young and happy that I was being ignored and he was having a good time. \nAround 2 am they all woke each other up and They ambushed him. They beat amd kicked PK through his sleeping bag. Eleven kids stomped on him, grabbed him, pinned him, spit on him. Some put oranges in pillow cases and whooped him with them. He just screamed. Crying STOP. Over and over. Please. I still fucking cry when I think about how scared he was. They didn't wake me up. I wasn't in on the plan. I woke up too late. There were too many of them. I was a fucking baby. I'm still wrecked I didn't do more. \nFinally stopped after maybe five minutes. BA's mom comes down. Lightly scolds all the boys. PK is bleeding and bawling. Calls his mom. She picks him up. He gets home. \nWhole thing was fucking awful. \nHe switched schools the next year and we met back up in high school and we were friends throughout. I have never talked to him about that night. Probably never will. He grew up to be an awesome man and an incredible human. \n\nTL/DR Jocks invite poor kid to party. Nice to him until he fell asleep.

            "text": "I wouldn’t call this prank “cruel”, but who it was pulled on did suffer some reasonable distress. I know this because I’m the one that pulled the prank.\n\nI was a sophomore in college and had this shitty job working at a cafeteria pretty early. I cycled and had to leave at around 6:45am. I lived at an apartment complex, and I also had a bunch of other friends that lived there. One of my friends apartments happened to be right next to the bike rack, actually his bedroom window, next to his bed, was right next to the bike rack. He hated waking up early so I thought it would be funny if I woke him up while leaving with my bike early in the morning. \n\nInitially I though I could just tap on his window or blast loud music through it. But no. I came up with something even better. What I did was take my shitty digital alarm clock, set it for 6:55am (right after I left on my bike) and duck tape it to his window. It was genius I thought, he would have to wake up early and walk outside and turn off the alarm. On top of that, as a safeguard, I told one of his roommates what I was doing, so there would be an explanation when my friend questioned why there was an alarm clock tapped to his window. \n\nSo I woke up, taped my alarm clock to his window successfully without waking him, and went to work.\n\nI pretty much expected him to message me while I was at work angrily calling me out for waking him up early, which was the expected outcome. But I heard nothing. No messages  during my whole four hour shift, but I remained silent and just figured my alarm mustn’t have gone off for whatever reason. \n\nSo my shift finished and I cycled back to my apartment, to find the alarm no longer on the window. At this point I figured someone just stole it and the prank was a bust. But I still go into their apartment to say hi. \n\nAnd as soon as I enter my friend yells “WTF IS WRONG WUTH YOU, WERE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME!!!!” \n\nUnderstandably I was very confused at this point. But my friends roommate, who was chuckling to himself, explained the situation to me.\n\nSo turns out my alarm did go off, it has a high pitched beeping sound when it does. The problem was when I taped it to his window only the back of the alarm was facing inside his room, and I used so much duck tape that he couldn’t see the face of the clock. So he thought it was a bomb. \n\nHe woke up, started panicking, thought he was going to die any second. He didn’t know what to do in the moment so he ran outside, ripped the “bomb” of his window, and threw it in the apartment complex swimming pool. \n\nThe cherry on top is that my friends roommate (who i told I was doing the prank) had to tell my friend soon after, because he was about to genuinely call the bomb squad.\n\nWhat began as a pretty mediocre prank, turned into a situation where my friend thought he was legitimately going to die. \n\nAnd that is my story.",

It was a drama one, where you put on a play, including writing the scripts, building the sets, and doing theatre games...it actually was super fun, I went the previous year and adored it, so I was super excited to return.\n\nI was tall for my age, and they were short a person in one of the groups, so when they asked for volunteers to join it, I put up my hand...turns out it was the teen group...at first I was thrilled to be in with the cool older kids, but joining that group soon proved to be a huge mistake...\n\nYeah, I get it. I was annoying. Older kids don’t like having youngsters around, I was like the annoying little sibling that’s been forced to tag along. However, the group didn’t just shun and ignore me when I sat alone at break times, and didn’t just roll their eyes and begrudgingly include me in things cuz the adults made them... they were bullies. They stole things out of my lunch, mockingly asked my gender and called me gay in front of everyone—because I had short hair and wore “boy” clothes as a 9-year-old—and complained to the teacher about being partnered up with me when I was standing right there... the teachers I think felt bad for me, so they were super nice to me and always chose me for improv games even when I screwed stuff up...that probably made it worse because then they knew I was a “teacher’s pet”...\n\nAnyway, one day a couple of them come up to me, all “hey Buddy how’s it going, come and hang out with us! Let’s go outside!” Like an idiot I went with them, and another girl was waiting outside. Suddenly one of the boys—the worst bully of them all—suddenly said to the girl that I kept bugging him—when I had done nothing. The girl jokingly said “oh do you want me to go beat her up?” Then she started towards me saying “get away from my man!” It dawned on me that it was a trap—they knew I wanted to be included, and then used it to lure me out to where no teachers were watching...I just turned and bolted back inside... I don’t know what would’ve happened if I hadn’t, and didn’t want to find out. \n\nOn the final day at the camp, we’d already performed our big play the previous day...even though we had to put on a puppet show for the little kids, I faked sick that day...so what if I left them hanging. I was beyond done with those assholes.\n\nBut this sadly seems pretty tame compared to what I’ve read on here... my heart goes out to all the victims.",

            "text": "A kid at my high school wrote a fake love letter from a teacher to a HS girl (using her home address) and then went to the teacher's house and put it into the mail by flipping up the flag on his mailbox.  \n  \nWhen there was no fallout, he did it again.  And then again.  Over a period of a couple of weeks, he sent roughly one letter every other day.  Each one got progressively more and more graphic.  The letters mentioned stuff that made them very believable, like what she wore that day and one time even something like \"I couldn't give you an A on that test, because then people would know.  But in my heart you deserved a higher grade.\"  (I'm paraphrasing b/c this was a long time ago.)  \n  \nIt finally came to a head when the girl's mom opened that last letter, which was full of explicit language describing the sexual acts the teacher wanted to engage in with the girl.  The mom believed it completely and went on a rampage at the school.  The teacher was suspended for almost a month while an investigation was launched.  Unfortunately, the media got involved, and there was constant coverage on the local TV news and in the papers.  Ultimately, the teacher was cleared (I don't know exactly how, though).  But googling that teacher's name still brings back the articles about how he was a teacher accused of trying to seduce a female high school student.  \n  \nThe girl suffered as well.  The whole school believed she was having an affair with a teacher.  Even after the whole thing was cleared up, there were still rumors going around about them.  Also, she had an unfortunate name that was perfect for warping into a salacious nickname (think \"Blowjob Betty\" but cruder and a lot more clever.)  \n  \nThey never caught the kid who did it.  We all had a pretty good idea of who it was, though.  Weird kid, prone to weird pranks, plus it was well known that he had had a crush on the girl (and she had rejected him harshly at some point).",

Perfectly harmless girl just wanting to get her education. \n\nMiss Meanie decided, as a prank, that she’d bake a ton of cookies and make a *special batch* for our musically inclined schoolmate.

They explain it was just a prank, but the guy is so shook he doesn’t believe them at first.

He set up calls from casting directors, producers, a call from “Seth Rogen” voiced by an impressionist & finally a table read. All of this was recorded over weeks if not months & the finale was during the table read where Jonah’s reading the script, as he’s in the middle of acting out this scene he turns the page of the script & it’s a giant picture of David giving him the middle finger. At which point he realizes what’s happened & just drops his head & David & all his friends pop out & laugh. Some say this was a harmless prank, but imo making someone think their dream is coming true, only to rip it out from underneath them & mock them seems really cruel to me.

So I caught wind of a prank by a trio of not very smart potheads with anti-authoritarian tendencies, known of them for at least a few years. The prank was to scare the class into thinking there was going to be a school shooting. On the day it was supposed to happen, they never showed up to school, so we kind of just were worried it wasn’t a prank and just stayed in classrooms for the most part as opposed to hanging out in the open. \n\nFound out later that they apparently got too high to go forward with the plan, which was to bring in several pistols in a duffel bag. The pistols were real. Of the three kids, two were followers and one was the main instigator. We found this out the next day when everyone else started catching wind finally and the school emptied out slowly but surely as parents yanked their kids from school as they heard this rumor from their scared kids. So me and my friends who knew the real story were walking around a completely empty campus. The school refused to cancel because they had already dealt with the situation and never bothered to inform anyone, probably for fear it would cause widespread panic! Which is exactly what happened by keeping it “secret”. School was cancelled that day at like 2 pm and school I think closed at like 3 pm anyway lol. \n\nThe creepiest part of this story, that makes the prank even less of a prank, was that the kid who was the instigator, a decent trombone player and bassist, later would take a lead pipe to each member of his family, killing them all, including his younger brother. So… I think this qualifies as as the cruelest “prank” I’ve witnessed… not entirely sure to this day about the “prankness”. \n\n[Oh Highschool](https://www.foxnews.com/story/man-arrested-for-slaying-family-says-he-cant-believe-he-did-it)",

After school, I went to his house to ask about it because I was heart broken that he would move on that fast.   \n\n\nHe told me that she showed up unannounced, flirted with him but he wasn't into it, and when he refused her, she dunked her head under his sink which he'd thought was weird but then she left. That whole day, I'd been telling my own friends how messed up what she was planning to do was.

The someone said we should really mess with him, so we decided convinced Matt that the girl wanted to meet at the bleachers on the football field at night. To add on to that we also ended up convincing Matt to shave down below before they meet. And the most messed up part of this was he was so happy and excited that he was going to get some from her not know we were just messing with him the whole time. During all of this Matt would send pictures to all of us bragging that he was texting “her.” When time finally came, we were hiding waiting for him to show up and when he did, we were laughing so hard because he was all dressed up trying to look so good for “her”. We texted Matt saying “meet under the bleachers and when he got under, we jumped out at him and scared him so bad he fell back and hit his head on a metal rod or pipe or something and he started bleeding... We felt so bad and while we were helping him up one of my friends asked him “How does it feel to have no public hair?” he got so Butt hurt he left right then and there and didn’t talk to us for a few days.

All in good fun. \n\nOne time in particular I decided to cling wrap his toilet. So when he got home from the airport I was banking on him having to pee and not giving it any thought. I was right. He peed and it sprayed everywhere. \n\nI got one text saying “You’re a funny guy” and that was it. He didn’t do or say anything at all, and that got me a little paranoid. I knew he’d retaliate, I just didn’t know how, or when. \n\nSeveral months later I went out of town for two days and I just asked him to come check on the cats. Make sure the bowls are full and the box is empty. That’s it. \n\nWhen I came home one of my ceiling fans right above my bed wasn’t working. The light turned on, but it didn’t spin. I do not mess with electrical things. So I let it go. \n\nHe came over one night, set up his phone to record without me knowing and proceeded to watch the chaos unfurl. Turns out he had shorted my fan to make sure that it didn’t spin. While I was in the bathroom he reconnected it. When I came out I flicked the switch to turn the lights on, and the fan began to spin. I was immediately showered in an entire bottle of talcum powder that he had lined the top of the fan blades with. I was in total shock. It was over everything in my small apartment. \n\nThe part that makes it cruel is that I have a pretty big collection of records and books, and I found powder in everything for the next two years, and I cleaned the crap out of that apartment after the prank was done. It was brutal. \n\nNeedless to say, we never pranked one another again. You win dude!",

We all jumped in the water happily, we knew it was a prank to the kid, I turned back and looked at him from the water and you could see that he was crying and wiping tears off his face while raking some leaves. Couple of minutes went by when the foreman admitted to the kid that it was just a joke.

I was chummy with most of the dudes there, but never really got along with one of the dudes, Trevor. \n\nOne day of the 5 we were there we decided to go bouldering, and for a bunch of kids from Florida, it was massively exciting. Heading there we followed a beaten path but when we were headed back, the group decided to deviate a little bit. They got a little ahead of me, and I thought I would be able to cut them off at the trailhead if I cut through the woods. One thing led to another and I suddenly found myself back at where we were all climbing boulders; decidedly *not* where I was supposed to be. I was lost and I couldn’t find the path anymore and could tell I was starting to panic. \n\nLuckily I had a cellphone with roughly one bar of service. The only other member of our party that also had service was Trevor. So I was texting him (couldn’t call because I didn’t have enough service) for directions. He told me to listen to the sound of honking and he told me that two of the guys from the group were gonna come back to look for me. \n\nAfter an hour to two hours of being totally and completely lost, I eventually found the path and ran into the two guys and walked our way back to the car. Two of the guys had gone to look for me, but they didn’t start looking until about 30 minutes *after* Trevor had told me they did. He also totally lied about honking the car horn. He thought it was hilarious that I was so scared.\n\nWhat he considered a mild prank, I considered a life or death situation. I very well could have been lost for days if it hadn’t been for two of my friends taking it upon themselves to go look for me. \n\nI still despise Trevor to this day. \n\nTL;DR: got lost in the woods, “friend” gave me bad directions and didn’t send help at all as a ‘prank’",

I told him I left a key at  our house, so if he  could head back there to change and meet me after.\n\nLittle did he know, I was actually in the family house. I climbed out of the window, locked the door from the outside and hid the key in our usual space, climbed back in the window, closed it, and switched all the lights off in the house. I then waited in a bedroom, lights off, for my brothers return.\n\nI heard him come in, go to the kitchen to grab some food, then sat watching  television food in hand.

Anyways, after the call, I got a message from the MySpace page asking me how I was and how my family was and how my dogs were. They named every single person in my family by their first and last name, named my dogs, described my room & the rest of my house. My friend was receiving similar messages. Needless to say I was scared shitless. It got to the point where I was receiving threats. I didn’t go to my parents because she told me we needed to figure it out and also pointed out that we were gonna get in trouble (I was very dumb and gullible, but I was good kid & hated to get in trouble). Anyways, her older sister told our parents, our parents confronted us about the messages and I told them everything. My parents made me delete my MySpace and that was the end of that. They explained how dangerous it could have actually been. Well a few years later, I found out it was my “best friend” sending me the messages to scare me. We are no longer friends.

However, i didn't know she'd be wearing a spooky mask and i didn't know she's litterally be right in front of the door.

Junior year was the first year I took any form of AP’s I decided to begrudgingly take AP Language and Composition despite the fact I absolutely was and still am a math person. My teacher who I had freshman year was a bit of a mess as a teacher: always waited till the last minute to grade any and all assignments, gave tests and quizzes which would average about five questions (questions were so obscure like what did Greg say to John on page 5, paragraph 4, line 7), and was also extremely unorganized to top it off. So it’s spring semester and we were almost done studying and reading The Things They Carried when we had an unexpected snow storm that canceled school for a school week. No one knew anything about what was going on because he wouldn’t answer his emails so all we could do is wait until we got back to school.  Once we got back to school I wanted to know when the test was, this man wouldn’t tell me. So one day I had to go to the dentist during his class, while I was gone he and my classmates decided to play a prank on me by telling me when I got back that the test was in fact next class period… I literally panicked, I hadn’t finished reading the book let alone knew enough to be tested on it. So I spent all afternoon and into the night doing everything I needed to do for the book (we also had to do a dumb little project). I read the entire book from start to finish in one sitting, completed the project all in one night. Next class I was so prepared I literally spent an entire night preparing for it. He passes out the test, I immediately start doing it, nothing looked out of the ordinary until I got to the second page, all the questions and answers basically said “it’s just a prank bro” I literally broke down once I realized what was going on. I had been pranked but not only my teacher but my classmates who KNEW how stressed I was. They even recorded my reaction thinking it was going to be funny. I didn’t tell admin or anything but I did write him a very long but professional email calling him out for his stunt. The actual test wasn’t until 3 weeks later, and because he felt bad he just gave me 100% on the test (I actually scored an 85). \n\nTLDR: My AP Lang class decided to prank me (an unbelievably stressed out and tired student) by giving me a fake test on the Things They Carried, broke down when I realized it was a fake test.",

My dad raised my siblings and me for most of our childhood. My mom wanted one of us to live with her, after she finally got on her feet.  Since I was the youngest I wanted to live with her.  I lived with her for 3 years, then moved back after my mom almost got evicted from her place.  She tried to show that she had finally grown up and wanted to be a mom by having one of us live with her.\n\n\nStory:\nWhen I was in 7th grade, around 12 to 13 years old, as an April fools joke, I walked up to my mom and told her that I wanted to move back to my dad's house.  I was holding back laughing, barely. She thought I was on the verge of crying.\n\nShe went into her room and cried and cried.  I didn't know this at the time.  After dinner my step-dad told me what had happened.  I felt really bad.  I apologized greatly to my mom.  Let's just say it broke her heart.

Being as we were all pretty mischievous pranksters we all locked our bedroom door while we were out of the apartment, since none of us trusted the others not to fuck with our stuff. One of my roommates got a lock pick set and he showed me he could pick the lock of one of our other roommates. This roommate believed in ghosts, so we went into his room and moved something fairly innocuous to see if he’d notice. When he got home that day he mentioned thinking he didn’t leave the item on his dresser. Over the course of the next week or so we got progressively more and more brazen with what we’d move, culminating with us flipping all the shirts and pants in his closet to the other side they were on originally. That day when he got home we were sitting on the couch playing Madden or something and he confronted us about it. He accused us of getting into his room and messing with him. Somehow we both kept a straight face and denied doing it so adamantly he believed us. His only explanation he told us was that there was a poltergeist in his room.

To begin with let me introduce the characters (names have been changed to protect identities). There is Jeff, Alex, and Sarah. Jeff and Sarah had dated most of the year, but had broken up a little over two months prior and Sarah was now dating Alex. Something else of note, is that Jeff was a graduating senior, whereas Sarah and Alex were both juniors at the time.\n\nNow that morning at breakfast Jeff began to hatch his scheme and went to Sarah if she would be down to play along. He explained his plan to her and asked if she could keep a straight face while everything happened, to which she replied “no, but I can cry on command.” The plan was set, but they both had to head to the fields before Alex came down. Once at the fields and everyone else was starting to warm up, Jeff and Sarah were huddled off to the side. When Alex got there, they motioned him over at which point Jeff began the prank.\n\nJeff informed Alex that Sarah was pregnant, but because of the timing it was unclear whose child it was. At this point Sarah turned on the water works and Alex began freaking out. Jeff continued to explain that he had already accepted a job out of state for after graduation so he wouldn’t be around, but he was planning to financially support Sarah and the child. What he needed from Alex was for him to help Sarah out with the childcare stuff, and to act as a father figure early on. Alex is losing his mind at this point as Jeff continues to calmly explain things like what Alex would be responsible for, potentially custody plans, etc. After several minutes of this, Alex is on the verge of tears so Jeff signals Sarah and together they yell “April Fools!” It takes Alex a second to process what has just happened, and he has already begun crying, and then he began to chase Jeff trying to tackle him and beat the shit out of him. As he chased Jeff, Alex kept screaming “you don’t fuck with people’s lives!” He was eventually calmed down, but Alex was pissed with Jeff and Sarah for awhile after that weekend.",

Then, when it's time to pick the finalists, Tyra Banks calls their names one-by-one.\n\nIn Cycle 16, however, they shook it up.\n\nTwo groups of girls were gathered and driven to different locations. One group of girls were driven somewhere and told... that they made the finals! They're advancing, they're finalists! They were super excited.\n\nThen another group of girls got driven to a building somewhere and told that, sorry, they didn't advance. Lots of tears and sadness, as you'd expect. They were told they'd need to pack their bags and leave... but they wouldn't have far to go, because SIKE! Surprise, they actually ARE the finalists, and the building they're in is revealed to be the house they'll be staying in!\n\nSounds great, right?\n\nOnly problem is that the *first* group of girls, who initially were told that *they* were the finalists... weren't finalists after all.\n\nNow, this being reality TV, you'd naturally assume they were paid actors or something, right? People wondered that for years, and assumed that they were. Well, with ANTM's sense of humor being a special kind of sick... years later, several of the girls confirmed to be from the first group (I believe they had proof, and were backed up by former show staff like Jay Manuel) came forward to reveal that *no,* they actually weren't in on the whole thing and that they were told \"It was all a joke, but sorry, I know we told you all *you* were the finalists. But it was the other group, and *you* guys are actually eliminated.\" They were pissed and devastated.\n\nSo basically ANTM pranked a bunch of girls by getting their hopes up and making them think they were advancing in the competition, and then shattered them by revealing that they were actually being cut.\n\nIt's a shame that they did that, as well as a few other really nasty and unnecessary things later on in the cycle, because it had a pretty solid cast, amazing photoshoots, and the top 3 was one of their strongest ever.",

A special needs student. \n\n\nMy friend \"N\" who is 10 years younger than me is severely more Autistic than I am. But he's loved by our entire school not out of pity or force. It was very genuine as people greet N and N would say \"hi!\" And say a fact. \n\n\nNew kid sees N walking in the hall going to the bathroom, he runs up and pantsed N, then shoved him causing N to pee himself. N began crying and ran tripping and falling with his pants down, causing a nose bleed.\n\nNew Kid \"TAKE THAT YOU FUCKING NERD! 'HI DOGS BARK SOMETIMES SOMETIMES DEH DOOO DURRRR!!!'  HAHAHAHAhaha ha?\n\nHis s friends immediately \"Dude...what the hell that's N!\" They shoved new kid out of the way. New kid calls them names \"Well he's a Retard!\" and with that he marked himself for a school wide bullying. \n\n\nNot even 5 minutes later, new kids girlfriend breaks up with him immediately, she told him she feels stupid for dating him. Staff learn and call him into the office. \"He tripped and fell!\" New kid protested but staff said he's gonna be suspended he's off the football team and to turn his things in. \n\n\nHe returns to see his truck had the tires slashed, headlights and taillights cracked out, water was poured into the gas tank, town mechanic learned and told New Kid to fuck off. \n\nNew Kid got jumped and everyone had a turn basically threatening him.\n\nN sadly needed a staff escort after this incident as it was the worst bullying in school we witnessed. They also would have N be escorted by friends. Usually big bulky guys who'd bench press a transmission for fun. \n\n\nNew Kid tried to go for me because \"I was more equal game and not popular.\" because he didn't learn. \n\nUpon failing to pants me he ended up getting held above the stairs by the scruff of his shirt and held over the stairs to inform him he picked the 2nd strongest guy in school. Who was friends with the strongest guy and would routinely bare knuckle box with him for fun. Only difference was unlike my friend who is an absolute sweetheart. My lack of empathy and violent anger and quick to physically attack was why people tended to not bother me.  New Kid failed that memo on his failed redemption arc. I pulled him back in and said \"touch me again and I'm gonna skin you alive out in the woods.\" And stomped his fingers with the heel of my boot. He threatened me and I told him \"good luck...no one will believe you...\" Because the staff saw me as a \"role model student\" New Kid on the other hand was the most hated person in town. \n\nNew kid in the end he dropped out of highschool. Last I saw him he was doing his \"big send off\" driving his messed up pickup back home on 4 flats no lights, no plates. (They got snapped off) and a smashed back window.  \n\n\nHis parents weirdly didn't sue the school \n\n\nLike we as a school mess with eachother but we were friends and kinda tight and usually saw eachother as kinda equals.

He of course got a lot of second hand smoke and was completely unaware of it. Some of us were watching TV and he was tasked with changing the channel(old school tv) and just sat right in front of the tv like a little kid watching cartoons. As he’s flipping the channel he comes across some xxx rated videos. I’m talking big moaning, hard slaps, lots of daddies and only one female. 15 immediately changed it but not before everyone in the room had seen. 15 plays it off like nothing happened and continues looking for something to watch but the channel keeps switching back to the p0rn. Everyone starts to give him shit for keeping in that channel and 15 starts to go crazy. He starts smashing the tv claiming it’s cursed(didn’t break) he’s screaming that he’s not doing anything, he even starts crying and sobbing that he’s a virgin and that this is not how he wants to lose his virginity. The volume goes up and it’s as loud as it can get. Everyone  is laughing their ass off when 15 older brother walks up him with remote in hand.",

She had to explain to them that peanut allergies are incredibly deadly and if he had actually ingested the oil he likely would have died. Note this was a fairly rural School and the closest hospital was at least an hour and a half drive away. \n\nTo their credit they did apparently seem genuinely shocked to learn this and actually kind of horrified at what they'd almost done. They continued to insist that they swear they thought he would at worst get a mild rash or an upset stomach. The teacher returned throughout this and before my sister could even say anything they admitted to what they had almost done and told him that he needed to clean out his coffee machine and that they didn't want him to get hurt they just wanted to play a prank. \n\nI think in the end they both got detention but I don't think it went anything beyond that.

His side is that he never did that. I didn’t know either of them but do know the school was considering disciplining the ones involved but I think they pretty much got warnings. The school did investigate though, like over the course of a week a bunch of people kept getting called into the office to go over their side including me but all I knew was hearsay and never witnessed anything.

Her parents didn't think anything was amiss because she was supposed to be sleeping over at one of the other girls' houses, and this was kind of a trashy '90s neighbourhood where parents didn't really check up on their kids much.\n\nLocking CJ in the shed was bad enough, but the crowd that did it had also coated the inside walls and floor of the shed with a thick layer of industrial adhesive (shed kid's dad worked in flooring or something similar).

I split open my chin and almost dislocated my jaw. Thankfully, even though the joint popped, it somehow stayed close enough for the doctor to put it back in place, up and in. Funny thing, I very nearly kicked my doctor in his gonads but he was experienced enough to dodge it beautifully. \n\nThe missing part here is as follows:\n\nI had asked one of my older cousins to help me oil the chain and brakes. They said they would, so I left my cycle there and went back inside to get my snack money from mom. Turns out, the bugger also oiled the rim of my tyres (I hope it's called the rim, the area where the brakes grasp the tyre?). That caused my cycle to not stop and hit a car who tried to turn right, pun intended, out of turn.\n\nA neighbour saw this go down and immediately took me to the doctor and called my mother. All the stitching and jaw setting happened over three days, something about the area being extremely delicate and needing an x-ray, hence they couldn't set it immediately. That was probably the worst X-ray I've ever experienced. They would have to hold my head down in a vice because I wouldn't as it hurt my stitches. Never again, not even wishing it on my enemies.\n\nAnyways, we come back from the hospital 5-6 days later and I'm still heavily medicated. I was to not speak, and mind you I'm a chatty person to this day, for 3 months. God that sucked, pointing to what you want, writing things down everytime you have some to say, but the worst was no solid food at all. My mother's cooking has never felt so divine as it did the day my doctor said I've healed as much as I possibly could and I could eat whatever I wanted.\n\nI was all of 10 and filled with a burning desire for revenge, I saw my chance. About a week after my return from the hospital, I saw the same bugger oiling his cycle, he saw me and taunted me, and that's when things get a little hazy. All I remember is my father shouting at me to stop and trying to get a grip on my hands and the guy on the ground, me sitting on him and blood. I was later told I ran at him and knocked him off the cycle (think Goldberg spear) and went to town on his snot filled Grinch like face.\n\nHe still winces when I look at him sideways, and good or bad, I want it that way.",

I went to school one day which my “gf” goes to it as well, it hits about 5th hour and I’m in my locker grabbing some books cause I may be big but I’m not stupid and carrying around 50lbs of books all day amiright? Anyways.... my friend walks up to me “Are you and cheatingho3000 still dating?” \n\nMe: “Uh?... Yeah?” *look on my face is one that kinda says get on with it if you’re gonna ask me a dumb ass question* \n\nFriend: “Well I just saw cheatingho3000 walk mrinnocentguy to class and kiss him...” *friend has that look on his face like don’t be such an asshole the next time I tell you some info you cuckhold*\n\nI end up going to class after asking if he’s sure, my science teacher was so fucking cool she knew immediately something was off as I was a social butterfly and I was thinking through my whole relationship instead... gave me some candy etc honestly best part to the whole story. I just threw this in here cause I know she uses Reddit and somehow if she sees this you’re dope af Ms. L and I did have a crush on your daughter she was pretty cool lol. \n\nAnyways I go through school and get home and I find my stepmom going through my phone (I said THAT stepmom I was already grounded for something stupid so she had my phone) she somehow finds out from someone asking if I was going to fight mrinnocentguy that cheatingho3000 did what she did. \n\nThis all happened on a Friday.... my step mom thought I was super depressed (I wasn’t?) and admitted me to a psych hospital under stipulation that I might kill myself (again LOL). I was in there for 7 days. I went a week without school.. the day after I got admitted my grandma threw a fit cause she hated my step mom and then the whole family ended up finding out... my cousins also went to school with me so in between misinformation and high school drama I literally had this poor girl think I was successful in committing suicide because she kissed mrinnocentguy. \n\nAll while this was going on I was chilling in a psych ward watching spongebob and eating fruit snacks.\n\n\nAnd if anyone WANTS to know.

They pick a random guy and crack open a soap bottle and squeeze a high gob right on his crotch. He wakes up and they bolt back to their bunks. He out of his bunk in my face about to slug me, but just walks away after a while. I've seen him every year I go back to the camp and wanted to explain but I'm not sure if he will believe me. Any way I'm glad I didn't get punched for something I didn't do.",

She was surprised at how many people were accepting the invitation.\n\nShe prepared a wonderful table of treats and drinks, bought flowers for beautiful settings on the tables, lit candles throughout the back yard and more. Her excitement was beaming.\n\nWhat she didn't know was that one of the popular girls caught on to her party and decided to get all of her friends to accept the invitation with no intention of showing up. For everyone else, she spread the rumor that the party ha been moved to her place, where she planned to entertain the diverted guests.\n\nIt was horribly successful. *Nobody* showed up for my sister's party. One of the most devastating things I had to witness was my sister sobbing and my mother trying in vain  to comfort her (and keep from crying herself) amongst the pristinely decorated scene of empty chairs and untouched snacks.\n\nMy sister didn't go back to school for 3 days, yet still the popular girls teased her upon her return.\n\nEver since, I do my best every year to make sure my sister has a great birthday. We have a standing date for an annual birthday lunch and we have fun going to the dollar store where I let her buy anything she wants.\n\nAs much as I may try to change history, I can't deny the damage her classmates did.  I know my sister changed after that day. Her innocence was lost. She had a wonder about the world that would never return, being replaced by a minor but evident reclusiveness she'd never shown before.\n\nIf you're ever thinking about a cruel prank - please... don't.",

Ewww!”\n\nAnywho, it hurt my feelings but 25 years later half of them are fat now and/or on their third marriage so.. jokes on them. 🤷🏼‍♀️",

He was faking like he’d been drinking it. Well, you see where this is going... he gets his neighbor to take a sip (there was some real shake mixed in) then another sip, then he let’s him keep the rest. It wasn’t long before we started dry heaving ourselves as we watched our friend drink our other friend’s loogies down a straw. The kid threw up. He ran away. He moved away shortly after. My friend and I went on to prank the rest of our neighborhood with basic shit like eggs and TP and fireworks, but that day... that prank... I’ll never forget it. Banana shake... I mean c’mon.

This got to the men's dorm-house, which had an insane guy who was itching to go there punch some sense into the potentially armed person, as an aggravator his gf was in the girls dorm. They called the police, the men's dorm was nearer to the entrance so the policemen got there first, told the guys \"when the lights flash, everyone rush towards the cars (I think 2 or 3) and wait on the other side. When he got to the girls dorm, guess what, the crazy birch kept the act and fed the *police* the story, added that they found later the backdoor of the girls dorm open. The guy walked around, saw nothing, shot upward to try and get a reaction from the nonexistent person, the men's dorm knew nothing of the plan to scare the person and we're all just severely agitated and had to literally hold down the crazy guy (who had a machete on his bag,  for some reason) , soon after the lights flashed, the guys ran to the car and waited. One of the girls who was in on it convinced the main chick to come clean that it was all an act. The policeman was dead sure that the lack of a suspicious person meant that it was one of the guys who was the culprit and had to be told the whole plan for like 20min to be convinced enough to not begin interrogating the guys to take at least one in. The church was fined for it and was nearly prohibited from having church camps, but one guy who was part of the camp crew was a police officer (which is why we had 2-3 cars called in), the girl who was drugged just slept and was told the story later, the girls who made this shit weren't punished bc everyone just wanted this whole shit done with and just really scolded her, the same alone of having everyone judge and be mad at them for the rest of camp was enough.",

He bought locks, but it was long before keyed gas caps, and each morning the locks would be cut.\n\nSo he bought a dead tractor from a junkyard with no engine or fuel line, cooked up a bunch of sugar syrup, added it to the fuel tank, and topped it up with diesel, then moved all of his trucks except that one to a friend's farm for the weekend, and slept the night in his truck at his lot.\n\nThe next morning, he found the man he bought his fuel from with his fuel truck dead on the side of the road next to his lot with burned sugar through the entire engine.\n\nGreat-grandpa called the local sheriff, who gave the thief a choice - give great-grandpa back the fuel he had stolen (it was a lot of fuel), sign over property worth the amount of fuel he had stolen, or go to jail.\n\nThing was, it was the Depression, so the only thing the man had of value any longer was the gas station where he was going to dump all the sugared fuel. Had he not decided to top up his fuel tank first, Great Grandpa and all the people who bought fuel from him would have ruined their engines.\n\nSo that's how my great-grandfather wound up owning a gas station and an earth-moving business. It never paid much, but he charged a fair rate for the gas they sold and made sure that people got what they paid for.",

Mike talked to all of us about it and told us not to use his labeled detergent. Mike is a good guy, keeps to himself and is kind of quiet, so we all agreed. \n\nA couple of weeks later Henry was swearing up and down while Mike walks in after work. Henry is pissed all of his new clothes are ruined and proceeds to yell at Mike. Mike looks confused and concerned and walks over and listens to Henry. He’s holding his hand as Henry cries about not having anything to wear for the big interview because his clothes are bleached. Mike cries with him. I’m standing there completely shocked. \n\nHenry promised Mike he would find out who put bleach in his detergent and proceeds to try what can only be described as Dwight Schrute interrogation tactics over the next several months. I was the prime suspect but had alibis. Mike keeps telling him it’s fine and that it’s ok and that it was likely a manufacturer defect. Henry gets on the phone with All’s parent company Sun and starts another few months of berating and complaining. There was even an investigation if memory serves correct but no vindication for Henry or Mike. Mike let it go telling Henry the only other folks who may have had access was the apartment complex an act maybe by an immature maintenance employee. Henry spent the next month berating the staff with threats and lawsuits. It got so bad Henry broke his lease and left right before he graduated. \n\nI never got involved in the whole thing but felt like there was something missing in the whole ordeal. Mike graduated, I graduated, and we all went our separate ways. \n\nYears later I saw Mike. We talked a bit and caught up. He was doing well. Had a wife and two kids. They had just finished shopping at Central Market and were just sitting under the shade while their kids ran around chasing bubbles. It was beautiful. In the soft glow of a midsummer afternoon Mike, leaning over just enough to hardly catch a whisper muttered, “It was me.”\n\nI had one of those Kronk moments. This guy… He put the bleach in his labeled containers days before Henry’s interview. He empathized with Henry to gain his trust. And lastly, used Henry’s pride against him by nudging him down a deeper and deeper hole. \n\nMike just smiled and I walked away knowing I spent a year in college living with a legend psychopath.",

So I called him back and was like \"hey man, I got some stuff you can pawn if you really need that money and you can just get it out when you get paid yada yada yada.\" So I picked him up and had a black trash bag in the back with like a xbox 360 in it by this time the xbox one had came out so the 360 was old news and we drive to the pawn shop.\n\nSo what he didn't know was I stuffed a Fleshlight in that bad with the xbox and when he got out of the car he thanked me for being such a good friend and went on his way inside the pawnshop. Soon as he got out of the car I was laughing so hard I was crying and I had no idea what his reaction was going to be yet but just picturing it was already good enough for me. About 5 mins went by and I started calling and calling him and finally he answered and said \" Man I oughta whip your big ass that shit isn't fn funny man why would you do that?\" He comes out to the car his face is bloodshot he is literally so mad I can see steam rolling out of his ears but I was still crying I couldn't see I couldn't talk I was just laughing to the point it was getting hard to breathe.\n\nSo aparently he goes in there with a big smile on his face and starts talking to everyone who works there and they ask what do you have here today and what would you like to do with it? Which we know everyone who works there pretty good and they are all really good people. The man at the front desk sticks his hand in the bag pulls out the xbox and all the cords and says \"Oh there something else in the bag must be controller and pulls out that flesh light and instantly screams \" WHAT THE FUCK\" and throws it at my buddy and says \" Man Idk what your thinking but that crap isn't acceptable here we don't buy those things thats disgusting.\" My buddy in a split sec says, \"Dude that's not mine idk what that is/how it got in there\" and everyone in the store is gathering around him looking at the fleshlight with the bright pink lips rolling around on the floor and there's kids in there and mothers gasping like what kinda sicko would do this. So he explains I must of pranked him he gets his money and comes out and he's just so damn mad I honestly didn't know if he would talk to me anymore but now we laugh about it and soon as I bring it up he will say 3 words to me **YOU MUTHA FUCKER**. \n\nIdk if you guys will find this as funny as I did but I just thought I would share it thanks guys",

So normally my dad or stepmother would just beat me for it if it happened which was every weekend I was there. One day my stepmother got tired of just beating me and decided to take me to a park at night. Mind you I was also afraid of the dark. Anyway, I was running laps to the lamp post and back to the fence. It went on for a little while and then all of a sudden I turn around to see my stepmother sprinting towards the car. I started screaming at her to stop, but she hopped in the car and sped off. I thought she had left me there to die. I started hallucinating and having a panic attack. Twenty minutes later she shows back up telling me she was joking and if I ever told my father she would beat my ass. Never told, but wouldn’t have mattered because he didn’t care anyway.\n\n2. When I was in 6th grade, I was the fat ugly kid and I was going through some shit with severe depression. I was always confused about what I was feeling mentally and the bullying at school made it worse. It was a small town middle school so most of the kids knew each other for years, but I had started the previous winter at the elementary school so I wasn’t really friends with anyone. Anyway, what happen was that this boy on my bus in 8th grade asked me out. I never had real friends let alone a boyfriend so of course I said yes. He wasn’t even good looking, but I was desperate seeing as how a lot of girls in my grade had boyfriends and being different from them I wanted to fit in. We dated for a week where we would only see each on the bus and he wouldn’t really talk to me except for a few conversations. Anyway at the end of the week he tells me to come to the back of the bus with him. Me being stupid, I agreed. The bus is going down the road and I’m not paying him any attention, but then I hear a pst sound. I turn and he has his dick out of his pants. I turned away fast. He then says, “this week has been boring let’s fuck on the bus.” I looked at him like he was crazy. I tell him firmly no. He then tells me “either you fuck me or we are breaking up.” I rolled my eyes and walked to the front of the bus while he and his friends laughed at me. They called me names and told me the whole dating me was a bet to see if he could get me to sleep with him on the bus. \n\nAnd these two stories are the reason why I have a hard time trusting anyone.",

The worst thing was being bullied for every waking second tends to make a person miserable and angry so I got labeled as the \"angry kid with behavioral issues\" and when I would try and resolve things the right way, by talking to teachers and administration, it was brushed off as \"oh they're just overreacting to a harmless prank\" or that I was making stuff up to get kids i don't like in trouble. Some of the things that school staff dismissed as pranks:\n\n- kid jumping on my brand new bike while it was locked up so the tires were bent 90 degrees.\n- getting \"garbage juice\" dumped on me. Yes, the liquids at the bottom of a garbage bin\n- a kid throwing my Gameboy into a pot hole full of water\n- getting invited to play soccer as an excuse to \"accidentally\" kick me every chance they got, then as a group saying I was lying and just fell and hurt myself\n- sticking gum in my hair\n- scattering the contents of my bag, every day, for weeks\n- throwing a slushie at me from the window of a moving car, as I tried to drag my bike home, yes it hit me, and it hurt. (Same day as my bike, same kid)\n- and the big one: getting my nose bloodied and my lip split. This was explained as an accident and when a witness said it wasn't, I was blamed for \"egging him on\"",

Later, as I was heading to my second period class, a bit late so it had already begun and no one else was around, I saw Josh sitting in the empty classroom and asked him if he was alright since he left earlier. \nHe proceeded to tell me he had to leave because he hadn't been feeling well. And confided in me that he'd recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Which was a straight, bold faced lie.\nBeing naive and gullible I completely believed him and broke down crying, telling him how sorry I was and asking if there was anything I could do. \nHe just let me believe it and cry there. I went to class with a tear-stained face and afterwards my teacher asked if I was alright, I lied and said yes. \nI was depressed and upset for the rest of the week until my mom finally pryed out of me what was wrong. \nWhen I finally told her she told me it must have been a prank.

            "text": "This probably won’t get read but whatever. \n\nI was the victim of a few, so I’ll start with the accidental one. \n\nWhen I was around 13 I had just started my first mensural cycle during the first week of summer. It was painful (sadly runs in the family) but only for a day (cramps SUCK) and was fine for the rest of the week. \n\nWell month later we’re at a family reunion and I’m starting not to feel well. One of my cousins came to check on me where I had fallen asleep on the guest bed and she noticed that my pants were stained (in my defence, I had eaten a lot of sweets and thought I just had a belly ache. Only my second time on the cycle and all). Well her younger brother followed and saw the same thing, and she told him to just stay out of the room while she went to find my Mom (family compound - five houses and a good sized property). \n\nThat little brat was around my age (thankfully he’s more than matured), and decided to be a stupid idiot. \n\nLet’s just say when I was suddenly woken to a hooded form standing over me with a ‘bloodied’ knife (Halloween prop), and of course me feeling the blood between my legs… it didn’t end well. He got a nice kick to the groin and I was so upset I wanted to go home (it wasn’t even 2pm). He got in DEEP shit with the family and I avoided or smacked him when he would come near me for the next five years. And I’ve never went out anywhere, not even to school the first day my period starts, whether I’m in pain or not. \n\nI did learn he just meant to get me back from when I accidentally scared him the Christmas before, but his execution was a disaster. \n\nThe *other* incident was meant to be cruel and totally destroyed my trust in people. I honestly can’t go into much detail because I’ve suppressed a lot of my memories about it, but i do know the basic rundown. \n\nSo I didn’t have a lot (any) friends in high school due to low self esteem and depression, but it felt nice when others wanted to get to know me. A group of my peers decided to pull a prank on me just for kicks, and asked me to hang out with them. I honestly wasn’t sure but since it was after school and would be during the daytime (we were all 16/17), I didn’t see the harm in trying (major regret). \n\nSo I text my Mom (they didn’t know I texted her, which is key), who’s fine with it, and at the end of the day we drive to a local café and start talking. I must’ve been distracted from my soft drink at some point, but one of them slipped a date rape drug into it. \n\nBy the time we left I was struggling to stay awake, and since they all brushed it off as tiredness (we’d had a school fitness event), and some of them seemed as tired as me… I believed them. \n\nI repressed what happened next, so I don’t recall the details, but…\n\nWhen I conked out from the drug, they drove to a secluded area and locked me in the truck after stripping me. They then joyrided down the freeway, listening and fricken recording me with a Go-Pro or something to see how I’ll react when I wake up. \n\nApparently I did wake up, and had a MAJOR panic attack. Screaming, kicking, crying, and still drugged up. They keep driving while I’m freaking out, until I passed out from all the crying. They then drive me to a wooded area, and wearing ski masks throw me, only in my panties, into the woods, and woke me up again. I don’t know what they screamed, don’t *ever* want to know, but they ‘chased’ me around, while I was still drugged, and making me panic and crash into poison ivy and even into a creek, getting me covered in rashes, cuts and bruises. \n\nThey then catch me, drag me back to the car, throw me in the trunk and go on a night joyride (unfortunately, it was a Friday night). I literally lost my voice from all the crying, and I know I wet myself, but it was pretty traumatic. \n\nI then passed out, they pulled over and dressed me, then they drove me to a cheap motel, where they left me for the night. Locked inside a room. Window blocked with a fricken cabinet. \n\nTHREE FRICKEN COUNTIES AWAY FROM HOME. \n\nI do recall waking at one point to use the bathroom, but not anything else. Though I must’ve started having another screaming panic attack as my next memory is being in the hospital, having to be sedated because I have another panic attack. \n\nTo make a long story short my mother was alerted by the police I had been found (she’d filed a missing persons when I didn’t come home or respond to her texts, and my godfather, an ex-cop, made damn sure they knew I wasn’t running away), so they had been looking for me and someone managed to get a report of a ‘panicking Jane Doe’ being admitted to a hospital 3 counties over. \n\nI had a rape kit done and thankfully it was clean, my Mom hugged the daylights out of me when she got to the hospital (according to my godfather, who came with, she broke every damn driving law just to get to me as fast as possible), and I was eventually lucid and calm enough to name names. \n\nWell police rounded them up on their way to the motel where they left me, got them to turn on each other (how we know exactly what happened given my memories are repressed), and they were charged and prosecuted. \n\nAccording to how the “prank” was supposed to go down was that they would retrieve me in the morning, bring me to one of their houses, and convince me that I had hallucinations and was crazy. Yeah…\n\nIt was really horrible and now I’m afraid to trust anyone, even if we’re friends or family. My immediate family actually picked up and moved us across the border to the neighbouring country because I just couldn’t go back to that same school (I’d… also been sexually assaulted by another student there when I was 13 (it was dealt with)) so I was honestly happy to leave that place. My parents even changed our last names because even though names were all redacted, kids and school knew what happened an rumours spread. I’m just grateful I don’t have to deal with them anymore. \n\nAnd yes, I’ve gotten major therapy. I’m better now but still in a dark place. Honestly I don’t feel I’ll ever heal after that cruel attack (it’s an attack, never a “prank”).",

Somehow she doesn't spot him. \n\nStep two: complete.\n\nMy dad quietly retreats, rolls up the hose and disconnects the plant food attachment, and goes through the house to come out the front door. She's surprised, and confused. He mentions she has something blue on her, and she sprays him swearing up and down he got her somehow.

            "text": "My female bestfriend pranked me on the day I secretly broke up with my ex-girlfriend. My bestfriend made it seem that I was subtly coming out of the closet. I left my phone with her because I was making sure to spend the next few days going through the post-mortem of our relationship with my ex. I don't want to leave her emotionally vulnerable because she's prone to making bad decisions to numb her pain, and I still wanted to be close friends with her after our breakup. The following week there seems to be rumors circulating in our school. My classmates treated me differently, even the guys in my basketball team, avoided me and stopped talking me. Some even looked at me with disgust. I thought they heard of me breaking up with my ex, because they'd just tell me that \"they respect my decision\". I thought that was that. I lost several friends whom I thought were decent people. I lost my place in the team because the coach said I needed to focus on my studies. I admit I wasn't doing great, but I wasn't failing either. All that time, I thought people were treating me differently because of my breakup. After a week of staying away from social media, because yeah, I was terrified of reading what our mutual friends are saying. And it turns out, it was because they all thought I'm actually gay. It finally hit me that all the friends I had were actually closet homophobes. I thought being part of a Christian community would mean being a part of a tolerant and accepting group of people, but I was wrong. My bestfriend didn't talk to me because she felt guilty about what happened and she knew I would flip out. All my efforts at helping my ex come to terms with out breakup were destroyed because after seeing my \"coming out\" post she obsessed on the idea that I only courted her because she looks like a man, one of her biggest insecurities because she's tall and big-boned. The truth is the only reason I broke up with her is because I'm not sure if my cancer treatment would succeed at the time, and I wanted to spare her of the heartbreak that my death would cause. I've seen how hard it is for people to see their loved ones suffering. My aunt had cancer herself. Looking back, it was really selfish of me to make that decision on my own. I guess the pain of the aftermath in being misunderstood, ostracized and feeling betrayed made that prank really cruel for me. I survived cancer, but many of my relationships with other people died after that.",

You could see from the recordings how much this trip would've meant to him, how it would've \"heal my stess; heal my mental condition\" and \"this will be a trip I'll never forget in my life\". It was 4 am when he rode with them to the airport and due to scheduling conflicts he actually couldn't go so instead of breaking the news to him gently, Doni and Coni turned it into a prank and had Jackson be driven off as they laughed with the cameras recording. Jackson thought it was prank when the car pulled out (hoping the driver would turn around). When they drove off he looked like he was on the verge of tears and clearly confused.

This is why I decided to get back to my wife, because it was her idea. She decided to not go to a Plzen brewery, because she was a bit tired and also like 5 months pregnant with our son. My later realized stupid idea was to take away her wallet. 3 of us were having a blast at the Brewery, visiting the production and the cellars for a couple of hours. Immediately when we came out of the cellars I receive like 5 text messages and 10 missed calls from her. Simply called her back then and my mood went from amazing to very bad. She was like terrified that somebody stole her wallet and she lost all of her documents (fudge fudge fudge). Then started explaining that she went to the store and bought a whole lot of stuff for us to have dinner and breakfast (amazing from her), but at the cash register she could not pay for anything because she did not know where her wallet was (imagine the embarrasment). If things could not get any worse, she even went to the local police station to do an official claim of lost wallet and documents. Oh man, I felt ashamed and sorry as hell about it. She was just about to call the bank, to cancel all her cards, but fortunately I called her just before she could do that.\n\nAll in all, she was very dissapointed at me and she could not even yell at me at all. She just started crying and that hurt more than words. How could I do this, why did I think that was a good idea etc. I just kept saying I am sorry for the entire day and tried to do everything for her for the next few days. Stupid stupid stupid prank!",

There was however 1 golden tazo and the prize for finding it was £1,000,000.\n\nEvery Thursday my grandparents collected their pension from the post office, the first thing they'd buy were 3 bags of Walkers Salt & Vinegar crisps (chips to Americans). Sometimes my uncle would collect these for my aging grandparents. \n\nI still remember the day my brother opened his packet and found the golden tazo. I'm glad he won to be honest, he was the selfless one. He immediately explained how he would spent it all: \n\n\"I'll buy Nana a new scooter so she can get her pension. I'll buy grandad a new wheelbarrow and spades for his allotment. Mum and dad I'll buy us a nice house so we can all have our own bedrooms\" \n\nI watched a strange expression grow across my uncles face. Even by that age I understood the face of regret. \n\nMy uncle worked for a packaging firm. He'd taken the crisps to his office, and carefully sliced down the plastic column seal along the back. Then he'd opened the pack and found a tazo inside. He then did the same along the packet for the tazo, spraying it gold before returning and heat sealing all the packaging. \n\nYeah man, I knew it was too good to be true.

I was so happy a boy showed interest since I was always treated as \"one of the guys\" so I'd always hide my romantic feelings. Told my mom about it and we went to the mall to find a dress. Talking about plans for the dance went on for a couple of months. The week of, I asked him what the plans were (if he was going to pick me up, what time we would meet, etc) he then proceeded to tell me that he thought I understood him asking me was a joke and that he wouldn't be \"caught dead\" going to a dance with me. He then started laughing and said I was dumb for thinking a sophomore \"football star\" would want to go to homecoming with a basic freshman and that I was too ugly for him to even consider it. I will never forget how he laughed at me and how it felt like everything was just romantically over for me... I was embarrassed and hurt. One of my guy friends (who went to a different school) called me later on that day and noticed I was crying. He asked what happened and I told him. While I was on the phone, my mom came in my room and asked what was going on. I told her we needed to return the dress because it was all a prank. My friend, without hesitation, then tells me no, don't return it. I will go to homecoming with you. I hesitated because a sick part in my brain thought he was playing a trick on me to. He wasn't though. The day of he showed up, brought me flowers and we had an absolute blast. The mean boy showed up with a beautiful girl from one of the private schools but they ended up having a very public blowout and she left him at the dance by himself. At that point I didn't care though. My friend taking me was the first time a boy treated me as a girl and not one of the boys. We are still friends today and this happened almost 20 years ago.",

So someone Ik was in a prank war with my friend let’s just say their name is Josh (none of these are real names.) The person he was in a prank war with was this kid we knew named let’s say Newt. So Newt went up to me and said he needed help with a prank. Now at the time I was chill with him so I went a long with it for a bit but I warned him this would end badly. So the prank was this, Josh has a younger sister, Samantha (again not a real name it’s just their to mask their real identities,) so Newt said he wanted to prank Josh by “fake kidnapping”Samantha. He wanted me to ask her if she would be on board cause she likes pranking her brother too. She said yes so we started drawing up plans. So on the day of the prank Newt wearing a mask and voice filter did a video call from Samanthas phone saying he kidnapped her. Now I wasn’t there but from what I know this is how the events unfolded. Josh was freaking out over the phone cause a part of the plan was to make it look like Newt was torturing Samantha. (None of it was real it was all fake blood and stuff) anyways. Newt hangs up and turns off Samantha’s phone. About and hour goes by and after all that happens and I get a call from Newt telling me what happened. However I never told him that Josh knew the entire time and cause I “Accidentally” wink* wink* left the plans for the prank at joshes house when I was there. So one of the things Newt said was he needed to sacrifice a young boy to satan as a list of demands that Josh had to do to see his little sister. So Josh knowing about the prank asked newts little brother to play in on the prank. So he pretended to sacrifice newts little brother ( same thing as before fake blood and all that) and called up Newt on his phone telling newt he did it. Now newt was freaking out cause he thought Josh actually did it and started freaking out. Newt then calls me who again wasn’t there tells me\nAbout it freaking out. And that’s when things begin to spiral downhill. Cause  Josh said he knew Newts location (which he did it was an abandoned house not far from where Josh lives he knew this because again leaked plans) and Josh said he was on his way to kill Newt not knowing he was talking to Newt this was after Newt called him from Samantha’s phone. This is where shit gets crazy cause Newts dad is a cop and Josh called in anonymously saying that a Maniac who killed his son also kidnapped joshes sister. To oversimplify what happens Newts dad arrests him only to uncover it was his son and I was there at Newts house for this cause I played a minor role but I was also a “outsider” so I needed to give a non biased perspective. TL:DR Josh and Newt were forced to end this stupid prank war, Josh was grounded for a year and Newt was sent to military school and me and Josh haven’t heard from Newt since.",

It was small things, like her sticking an \"I love dilfs\" bumper sticker on his car, him packing some fake bugs into her lunch, etc. Well one day she hit him with a classic deez nuts joke and it went pretty viral online, and it was all over our school. I guess he decided to take it up a few hundred notches, and pulled the most unfunny prank I've ever witnessed. \n\nOne day a few weeks after the viral video, when she'd thought she had won the prank war, the teacher gets a phone call. She looks worried and calls the girl over to the phone. She talks to whoever is on the other line for a bit as we carry on with the lecture, and all the sudden we hear a heart piercing scream and she falls to her knees and is shaking and sobbing. The teacher rushes over and tries to ask what's wrong, but she can't even form cohearent words. She eventually is able to say, \"mom, shes dead, my mom is dead\" and she just keeps sobbing. My heart broke for her, because I know just how close she was to her mom. The teacher calls the nurse and has her come down with the school wheelchair to get her out of the room because she was just too week to stand. She was the most heartbroken I thought any human could ever be, and if we had already eaten lunch I'm sure she wouldve thrown it up. The class is silent for a bit after she leaves, some of her close friends are crying because they knew her mom too. The rest of the day passes with somber silence from everyone in that period, and I made sure to tell my mom I love her that night...\n\nDad walks in with her the next day as she holds a new iPhone, and tells us all It was a prank. She was absent that Friday to be on a beach trip with her mom, which the dad paid for. She also went on every school trip after that.\n\nTL/DR: Dad pranks his daughter by saying mom died, and dad definitley PAYED the price.",

So when his deskmate came back to sit, X didn't move his chair but instead he held his very sharp pencil in the middle of his deskmates chair such that the sharp part was pointing upwards. The deskmate didn't notice because X distracted him by pointing away to something which led his deskmate to sit on the very sharp pencil. He sat on it with so much force such that it peirced through his shorts and the kid started bleeding and screaming as the pencil was stuck in his a$$(what we assumed).\nHe was rushed to the Nurse's station and was actually taken to the hospital to get stitches.

            "text": "I find the 'cruelest' ones are usually the ones that resonate with you- little or big- but which do tend to be personal pranks. So here's my lame prank story.\n\nI have a twin and we notoriously did not get along for a very long time. I mean, hated one another from birth until maybe 17 and didn't really get along well until 22. Now, at 27 we're closer than ever.\n\nWhen I was about 15, at my lowest and loneliest point in High School, she started dating a boy who was a grade older and was connected through siblings and friends to my older sisters bf at the time- so they all always hung out and I was just there in my room alone a lot of the time. I didn't have too many friends, this was around the time anyone who was obsessed with anime and wore Tripp pants(lol) was considered weird and I was made fun of ALOT ALOT. I had two close friends, not a big circle at all.\n\nAnyways... The boy I lost my v card to had just told me he didn't actually wanna date me and just wanted to 'hang out'- which sucked, but hs boys are mean, I guess. Being a teenager I just felt desperate to understand the situation and to just get him to like me LOL. So in a very very short way to make it simple, without the whole story- cue the start of the lowest and loneliest part of my teenage years.   \nMy twin and her friends seeing this, think it would be awesome if I tagged along to prom with them to help me(?).. I was sort of actually excited, mainly just that someone wanted to hangout with me (sappy af I know lol, but I was young and dramatic). So they have me meet this guy and we all hangout for like a month together on weekends and even though I feel out of place, I chalk it up to my lack of social skills. \n\nIn between all of that, I go and get a prom dress. I'm excited! My moms excited! her twins are finally being sort of nice to one another!! It was like, all coming together, right?  \nProm night comes, and my twin had spent the night at a friends house and was getting ready there. I was getting ready at home, and the plan was for everyone to head to our house for photos, because we had the biggest yard and such.\n\nOnly turns out the guy I was supposed to go with had a date the entire time and never planned to go with me. It was 'a cute girl' from...my art class that sat at my table...   \nThe audacity to show up at my house with a date though...was shocking. My twin swears she didn't know until that day- and this is ...09? and my twin & I didn't have a cell yet, so she couldn't get ahold of me and didn't want to call the house and tell my mom. Which looking back was the worst thing ever, because I don't think I've ever seen my mother so mad. My twin did leave the dude she was with after that. She said they kept laughing about it all night and it just never sat with her well. One of those 'I can hurt my sibling but you can't things'- ya'll siblings get me. I assume my mom let her go to not deal with two upset children that night, but I wouldn't know because I didn't leave my room.\n\nI can also only assume the purpose was to hurt me and laugh at me.   \nIt just was very cruel to a 15 year old who felt isolated and like no one liked her. If anything that just solidified it in my mind back then. It just sucked to like go through a shit time and see some hope and then just like, get made fun of and left at home wondering what I did wrong, because at 15, you don't really understand why people do things. You think it's always because you did something wrong when in reality it's because they're a-holes and are unhappy themselves.\n\nI don't think I ever really told anyone about it I was so embarrassed, oh well. I'm sure they did. Twin and I have talked about it, if the dates name comes up ever, my mom though, she still gets mad lol.",

The radio station called it “Chainsaw Wakeup”.\n\nNow, that’s already terrifying enough as it is. One guy called in and said he thought it would be HILARIOUS to pull this “prank” on his friend who had a serious phobia of clowns. \n\nHe gave a backstory that went something like: “Oh yeah, when he was like 3 he got trapped in this closet full of clown dolls. He was in there for like 8 hours until his parents finally found him. He’s had a phobia of them ever since.” (It’s been about seven years since this happened, so the memories are a little foggy in my brain.)\n\nAfter his little spiel, the radio station called his friend. His friend picked up, groggy from just being asleep, and before he could even say hello you could hear the revving of a chainsaw and the maniacal laughing of a clown. \n\nAnd then, gunshots. \n\nRevving of the chainsaw. \n\nNo more laughing. \n\nScreaming from the guy on the other end. \n\nThe radio station hung up the phone.

So it's kind of difficult for me to look back and discern which events were just regular bullying and which ones were pranks. I'm not 100% sure this counts, but I'd have to say the cruelest one involved my supposed best friend at the time, Mazie. Our mom's were best friends so we spent a lot of time hanging out. She wasn't really a friend, but she was the only one I ever spent time with and didn't get bullied by. Until one day in 6th grade. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd been seeing a boy a year older than me, Andy. When I say \"seeing\" I mean hidden makeout sessions. Turns out he was just buttering me up to try to get into my pants but that's a different story. I'd been seeing Andy for a couple years at that point. I told Mazie about him. She thought that was very interesting. A couple months pass by. It's the 4th of July party. It's an American Air Force base in Italy so pretty much every American person within a radius of 30 miles is there. Mazie and Andy are both there, both pretending not to notice me or each other as per usual (the noticing was done in private). Mazie tapped my shoulder and whispered to follow her. She led me behind a row of trees and pointed at some bushes about a hundred feet away. She said \"a couple weeks ago I had sex with a guy in those bushes.\" At that point the only stuff I knew about sex were what I'd learned in that special 1-day 5th grade health class for prepubescent students. I was concerned, because I didn't think that was physically healthy for a girl our age. But, in an effort to be more normal, I asked the only question I could think of: \"who was it?\" \"Andy.\" I never spoke to her again after that. I didn't want to believe her, so I kept seeing Andy, pretending I'd never heard Mazie say anything. But, turns out, she'd told the whole school that I was seeing Andy. She also added a little something in the form of telling them I was the one who had sex with him. And to top it all off, she claimed that I'd been so disgusted by sex with a guy that I'd turned into a lesbian and asked her out. 10 years ago that last bit was enough to make you a social outcast. Well, even more of one than I already was. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish I could've gotten revenge. But even then and even after so much hurt and bullying, I couldn't bring myself to cause her or anyone else any real hurt. I may have been awkward and disobedient but I wasn't malicious. I've never liked being the source of the hurt because I've been on the stinging end of it my entire life.",

I'd never been more terrified in my life. I was nauseous and shaking and felt like literal jello.\n\nI think we ended up in a Kmart parking lot and there was the other car. Perfectly fine.

Apparently their fur is so thick that it won't fully dry (I think). Anyways, her younger brother and his friend took the chinchilla and painted it yellow to look like Pikachu. The poor girl was so distressed, she used a rag and a toothbrush, I think, to get most of the paint out but some off it was still on her chinchilla. She was asking what she should do and it was obvious she was probably having an anxiety attack, all of the comments were telling her to take it to an emergency vet or call a vet. She called a vet and they told her to bring the chinchilla in as soon as she could. The thing is, she didn't have enough money to pay for it, so she had to start raising money. She was able to exceed her goal, but I haven't seen any updates on what happened to the poor thing. And I'm pretty sure the brother and his friend didn't get in trouble at all. \n\nMoral of the story: Don't do any pranks that involve pets.",

She didn't  understand he was laughing at her while he jokingly asked her to feel his hiceps etc. He and another girl on the dance team spoke to her often about how she liked him wanted to kiss and marry him. She then confided in me that she felt devastated and even suicidal after finding out it was all a  joke to mess with her. I let the teacher know who told me she doesn't  know what she's  saying and she most likely didn't feel suicidal. I still said she should still get help and was quickly dismissed. The next year in a class together a guy was talking to her in a very fragile manner, it irked me so I confronted him. He said that he couldn't  be too nice because  she would think he liked her because  of the previous incident(which I hope he didn't know the details because she was obviously lead on). \n\nAnother is asking people out as a joke. I got asked out often as a prank a lot in high school. When a guy genuinely  wanted to date me I  replied \"ew no way.\" Because all his friends  were huddled up and whispering to each other watching. I interpreted as another group of guys daring a friend to ask me out but the guy actually liked me. I didn't  find out he was serious until years after I graduated so there wasn't  much I could do. That stayed with me a lot I  still feel a little shocked when someone  genuinely wants to date me even after so many years.",
