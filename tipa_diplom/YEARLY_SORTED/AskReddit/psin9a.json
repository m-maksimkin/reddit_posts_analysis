Nothing in life is truly free, and neither is the vaccine, no one knows what it will do to one’s body long term, no one will tell you what’s really in the shots, and there’s no actually REAL evidence that these things even work. And they’re constantly trying extremely hard to guilt trip unvaxxed people into getting it. Specifically trying to make things more difficult for those who don’t want it, even though they say it’s “your choice” but a lot of the times they also immediately say “but if you decide against it, it’s going to cost you” just without actually saying it. This whole covid thing is a conspiracy and most people don’t realize it because they’re too busy being afraid and listening to what society and/or the mainstream media outlets are telling them about it. When there is a clear and documented history of the government, the media, and corpos like big pharma lying to the masses and hiding their true intentions to make sure that they get what they want out of the sheeple citizens that don’t bother to question what they say. The government, the media, and big corporations have lied to people for decades on end, and most people seem to just have forgotten about it, are completely uninformed/misinformed, or seem to just think that these people and companies just decided one day to stop lying and deceiving millions of people to get whatever they want. Surprise surprise, they haven’t changed and they never will. Don’t get vaxxed, don’t wear a mask unless it’s absolutely necessary, like going to the doctor or something. It’s not a law to get vaxxed but i wouldn’t doubt that they might try to make it one. Some of the darker affects of covid is the separation of small subgroups of people, being divided by race, religious beliefs, political views, sex/gender, financial status, vaxxers/antivaxxers, and so on. And they keep people blind to this shit by pointing fingers at the masses saying it’s “our fault” and projecting it onto us. Because they know that the more divided we are as “one nation under god” the less power we have against them if we wanted to over throw them and demand for change. “We the people” are supposed to have the power to bring about change when things aren’t working, but we can’t do that when we’re constantly being divided into small groups, then those groups being divided into even smaller subgroups, and so on. Take for example this statement in the american pledge of allegiance “One nation under god, INDIVISIBLE, with liberty and justice for all” except we are divisible, so there is no liberty and no justice. It’s just proof that divided we are weak. Look at politics for example, it’s a puppet show meant to split the american population right down the middle on just single or even just a few values and ideals, it’s the greatest division there is. “If you don’t vote you’re not doing your part for your community, or as a citizen of this country and are almost inherently un-American” that’s basically what society tells you from a young age. They want you to feel like you HAVE to pick a side in order to do your part. But i think that standing no where on the spectrum is perfectly american if you’re doing so in order to bring up the fact that something is CLEARLY wrong here. If people don’t realize that we are being divided in order to be weakened and controlled then they are truly blind. If only people could all focus on the bigger issues at hand, we could end all of this, but i have little to no faith that the majority of the population is actually going to wake up.",

We need to understand that babies born during covid will be developmentally screwed up, and we need to work to fix it ASAP with therapy. A coworker at my previous job had a baby during covid. She told me how he's afraid of strangers because all he sees are masks. So when non-family members aren't wearing one, he becomes frightened.\n\nJust so you know, the human face is the single most important thing for babies to see, get used to, and understand. So much so that our minds are trained to see faces everywhere, even with minute resemblance (shadows, the moon, clouds, etc.). Babies need faces to understand the world around them and to develop mentally. Psychology shows that babies who are not exposed to faces are practically guaranteed to develop mental disorders such as sociopathy, anxiety, depression, autism, asperger's, ADHD, major trust issues, major self-esteem issues, detachment and attachment disorders, and the list goes on. These children will need immediate exposure therapy or else we'll have an entire 3+ years worth of children who will be fucked in the head for the rest of their lives.",

These hospitals are overwhelmed with Covid and nurses are leaving because they can’t handle it. I don’t blame them but it causes another problem. Everyone needs to be vaccinated. The action or non action of people eventually affects everyone. It keeps me up at night.

Interacting with other kids and learning how to socialize is such a vital part of growth and its being taken away from them. \n\nI can’t imagine what my childhood would’ve been like being stuck inside for 2 years. It’ll be interesting to see studies that come out in a couple years once more data is gathered",

Also we do talk about these aforementioned issues due to the covid, abudently for some of them.\n\nBut I think the DARKEST and not being discussed enough effect is the rampant monitoring of individuals. It all starts with the best intentions.

We want to believe that if we make the right argument, present them with the right evidence, show them how the people they trust are lying to them, they'll come around. But none of it has budged them. Billion-dollar businesses have spent two years trying. They will actively fight anything that says they're wrong, and if someone who has been lying to them tells them the truth, that person is clearly compromised. Each person is going to stay that stupid as a matter of sheer stubborn pride, until either reality kicks them in the teeth in a way they can't ignore, or they die. And there's 50/50 odds that after reality kicks them in the teeth, they'll still find some way to blame it on the Libs. Hell, there's good odds that even if they die, they'll still be spitting venom about masks with their last breath.\n\nFor christsake, now that the vaccine has been FDA approved, their current talking point is that the Democrats have used reverse psychology on them and chosen to go all-in on vaccination, knowing they would be forced to choose death on principle alone.\n\nThe dark effect I'm talking about is, I can't do this anymore.

I read a thing yesterday that indicated that infection (aside from lockdown stress etc.) can exacerbate pre-existing mental health issues and trigger them in those pre-disposed - and I have no idea why people aren't talking about this other than the fact that people in general don't like talking or thinking about mental health.\n\nLast time I checked we were at around 130 million confirmed cases globally, and potentially even more asymptomatic - and given that one of the routes into the brain is the olfactory nerve apparatus (nose directly to brain) vaccination might not even prevent brain damage given that they're not designed to protect the site of initial infection. The delta variant is even better at infecting the landing zone than the previous variants - they're working on nasal inhaler vaccines to provide better protection but it could be too late. This virus could be seriously world-weirding, long term.\n\nThink about all the people too paranoid to take the vaccine, or self-medicating with drugs and alcohol, or suffering persistent fatigue, brain fog, depression etc.\n\nWhat if the cause, in a lot of cases, isn't psychological but neurophysiological - as could well be the case?",

Wish you'd have known that, I bet. Stroke, heart attack, deep vein clots... all very common with covid because it causes diffuse clotting. People were angry early on that people's death certificates were \"wrong\" for including covid when someone had a heart attack.. if there's a blood clot in your coronaries and you've got covid, yeah it was probably the covid. If it was plaque that's just artery disease and would have happened anyway. It has profound neurological effects. Even minor cases of covid that don't require hospitalization make people \"off \" .. slower, poor attention, disorganized thought, acting strange. In more serious cases its hard to describe. You get someone who finally survives covid with full on life support and you can't help but think \"Wtf is wrong with this guy?\" I'm talking 40 year olds playing in their own shit. Disconnecting the ventilator circuit from their tracheostomy. Just acting full on wild sometimes when you recall weeks or months ago that before they were tubed, they were pretty normal. So that we have to restrain them for prolonged period of time because i cannot watch just one person like a hawk when I've got other gravely sick patients. Even before they get intubated they don't act right. Hypoxic people normally do strange shit but this is another level. Ripping off the face mask they desperately need to avoid intubation, their oxygen saturation IMMEDIATELY falling to very low levels, and then continuing to tell me they're fine don't feel short of breath and insist they finish drinking their water. Then a little later they get tubed after pulling off the mask again.

            "text": "PLEASE READ.\n\nCOVID’s long-term effects are something not a lot of people are talking about.\n\nI am 19, and was 18 at the time of the events I’m describing. My past medical history includes a diagnosis of celiac disease, which is an auto-immune disorder. I am in college studying electrical engineering.\n\nI had COVID last October, and other than a sore throat and some fatigue, nothing too bad happened. Skip four months to February, and I was hospitalized for 7 days. During that time, I had 102-103° fevers, constant violent chills, and vomiting almost daily (often multiple times). They tested me for everything in the books, including: COVID (three times), mono (twice), flu, strep, Hepatitis A-C, sepsis, bacterial infections in my urine and stool, a full comprehensive viral panel, HIV, and others I forget now. I saw around 4-5 different doctors while in the hospital including different specialists like immunologists, and none had a straight answer. They decided it was best to start treating me for sepsis, or a bacterial infection of the bloodstream.\n\nI was scheduled for (roughly, it’s been a bit of time) 200mg of Tylenol every four hours, anti-nausea medication and an antibacterial medication intravenously. This was the only way I could consistently break my high fevers, because before this schedule after every 4 hours on the dot, I broke out in chills and high fevers.\n\nA highlight of the hospital trip was the third night, after not having slept more than 3 hours at a time (the nurses came in every four hours to check my vitals, including during the night) and little food and sustenance besides a constant IV drip, they prescribed me for phenergen, a strong anti-nausea medication. It was to be taken intravenously, and it’s supposed to knock you out. However, as I was already in a bit of a delirium from the conditions I was dealing with, I was sent into a full psychosis complete with hallucinations and conversations with imaginary people. I saw bugs on my arms and in the room, and I cursed out my own mother who was trying to take my phone away and let me sleep. I was still under it come the morning, and it took a bit of time to get out of.\n\nCome the fifth day, I finally broke the fevers, but the nausea and vomiting worsened. They wanted me to stay longer than 7 days, but my mother being a nurse practitioner decided it was best for me to see specialists closer to home. I spent the rest of the semester seeing cardiologists, oncologists, and immunologists all with no clue what happened. They ruled out cancer though, thank God. I even tested positive for mono somehow during that time around the end of March, to which the oncologist who ordered the tests was baffled.\n\nSkip to June, and I’m seeing an immunologist that practices near the hospital I was taken into. He finds that I likely had Multi-Inflammatory Syndrome for Children (MIS-C), which is (very generally) an implosion of ones immune system. This explained how heightened my symptoms were, and how alarming my bloodwork was (all the immune tests were incredibly high). He shared with me a case study of another 18 year old male who was taken in with similar symptoms and treated for sepsis like I was, and he died suddenly of multi-organ failure in the hospital. I’m lucky to have made it out alive.\n\nNow, in September, I had a checkup visit with the immunologist and he was describing how many kids are experiencing this syndrome after COVID. It takes roughly 6-8 weeks to take effect, and with the new variants like the delta variant, it’s even more shortened to 2-4. It targets mostly white male teens, and the hospital was described as “overwhelmed” with these kids. He described how COVID is almost changing peoples immune systems, and how not only the immune system but the cardiovascular system is being terribly effected long-term.\n\nThis whole experience has thrown a lot into my life, and I’m happy to have made it out alive. It’s thrown quite a wrench in my college career, but I’m going strong. My only concern is that these new variants will cause much worse effects, and I have had to change a lot of my own activities in order to avoid even the chance of catching it again.\n\nI’m fully vaccinated and likely will get a booster in a couple months when I’m able to. The point to all this especially is to PLEASE get vaccinated, it’ll save so many more lives.",

I don't blame you at all for thinking that, especially considering the hateful views many (but not all) denominations have. \n\nHowever for me, and many others, my religion is something that makes up a pretty strong part of who I am. It's helped me personally get through the darkest of dark moments in my life, and it's also been a presence in some of my most joyous moments. I've always felt a great deal of personal comfort being in a church. \n\nWith Covid-19, I can no longer even go to most churches because there are a lot of \"Christians\" out there who aren't vaccinated and won't wear a mask. In most cases, I could avoid the churches with hateful opinions, and I could tune out the members who had opinions I disagreed with. But you can't tune out germs. Misinformation and Republican rhetoric has made going to church a physically dangerous thing. \n\nI'm fortunate that I go to a progressive church with positive views on LGBT/social justice issues, is in a very educated area with some of the highest vaccine rates in the country, and has the technology to do remote services. But most churches aren't like that. My family back home goes to a church that has a vaccinated rate of about 50% and is in a state with no mask mandates. They haven't been to church since the pandemic started, and may not go back. This is a church where multiple generations of my family have gone to to the point where some walls have images of my great grandparents on it. \n\nIf going to church is now an unsafe option, on top of all the hateful views some churches have, how the hell is it going to bring in new church goers and survive long term?\n\nTLDR: Love your neighbor and protect them by getting vaccinated.",

I have to make the effort to remind myself that if people need help, they need help. And that there is no measurable limit to what constitutes as need.\n\nMy brother ran out of his antipsychotics and needed to make an appointment to refill his script. Only there was no one to see him. They ran out before he could get the appointment. Sure enough, withdrawal put him in the hospital - where he still had trouble receiving attention. This was a month ago. He attempted suicide last week. But his perception was finally filled bc his hospital stay was motivation enough to waive the need for a psych visit.

Lots of Funeral services without the need for in-person care.

This is assumed to be related to so many people being home and running appliances vs businesses paying cheaper rates and using more efficient cooling etc.  (The hottest summer after the coldest winter on record helps too.)\n* Payday loan companies - We knew this was going to go, soon as we saw the hit to employment, so investing here was a no brainer.\n* Collection companies - they go hand in hand with Payday loan.\n* IT core services - This was pretty clearly going to be going up, but with the move to remote it was expected colocations would go up, so we invested in REITs that specialize there.\n* Medtech (COPD and Vent manufacturers) - I almost don't even need to say why.\n* The companies holding theraputics for C19 (this was added after it was clear that someone was trying to convince people \\*not\\* to take the vaccine, it would increase the demand for theraputic treatment)",

(My experience was with 7-8yos.)\n\nFirst, their anxiety was through the roof. Many kids refused to participate in any activities because they were so afraid of even being close to one another. We kept this in mind and made sure to plan activities that wouldn’t be too overwhelming for them, but it didn’t really make a difference. On the other hand, children with extra energy or behavioral issues were nearly impossible to work with. Also separation anxiety was an issue for the overnight campers. Not to say these things aren’t challenges with children in general, but this summer it was exceptionally more difficult to manage compared to the many other years I’ve worked this summer job.\n\nSecond, some kids could not even form a sentence or a phrase that did not directly come from TikTok. All the counselors joked that the kids only speak in memes, but it’s really strange to see. Many kids also repeated innuendos or inappropriate jokes from the internet that I KNOW they didn’t know what it meant (again, these are 7 and 8 year olds). This happened occasionally in previous years but some kids have been truly raised by social media for the last 2 years.\n\nLastly, it just seemed like in general the development and mental growth of these kids seemed to be delayed. The 7 and 8 year olds were really behaving like 5 year olds. Their educations did not seem as strong as kids of previous summer sessions. I don’t want to sound like one of those boomers that says they have lost hope in the new generation, but I am concerned for these kids and hope they can have some good teachers and mentors in the coming years that can help them return to “normal life.”",

One thing we regularly talk about in our meetings about covid are the long term effects that the virus is having on people who have recovered (commonly referred to as \"long covid\"). Some of the more severe long covid effects are atrophy of the dura mater of the brain, stiffening of the pleura in the lungs, and atrophy of the ventricle walls in the heart. There are many other effects like prolonged loss of taste and smell, chronic headaches, fatigue, joint stiffness/pain, and a pretty large variety of others. This meta analysis was posted in January of 2021 and identified 55 different long covid symptoms that patients are reporting.

These things are massively increasing the difficulties in people being able to process their loss and grief, even when the person has not died of covid-19.\n\nWe rely on these rituals, these mourning processes, these avenues of community support, to help us come to terms with and cope with loss. So many of these comforts have been denied to people. Both to those dying and those who are being left behind.\n\nIt has been a gruelling and incredibly depressing 18 months in this field, and I believe that we are going to see a huge amount of unresolved trauma and complicated grief over the next few years.\n\n(edit: grammar)\n\n(Edit 2: I just wanted to say that I'm blown away by the response my reply has had.

I don't know if I will be able to keep up with all of the replies and messages, but I wanted to say that I will do my best to read them and respond where I am able. \n\nIn a lot of ways, the incredible response to my comment shows how much we have in common, collectively, as we make our way through this pandemic. So many stories of trauma and sadness and grief. Thank you for sharing them here. I believe that healing can begin when we share the burdens we carry, and when we feel truly heard. \n\nFor anyone struggling with their grief, please reach out to support groups or organisations that may be able to help you. While demand for therapeutic services is at an all time high, we are doing our best to help as many people as we can. While grief itself is devastating, the complications of trying to mourn during a pandemic can lead to similar responses to PTSD, like intrusive thoughts and images, preoccupation with the person who has died or the manner of death, low mood and depression, anxiety, hyper-vigilance, and feelings of isolation or dissociation. Grief is inevitably painful, but stalled grief can be overwhelming. Please reach out for help. You don't have to do this alone.\n\nFor those, like me, who are in the helping professions, such as carers, therapists, healthcare workers, etc, your mental health is as important as the people you help. Vicarious trauma and burn out are real, and you will also need support. \n\nWe are dealing with a collective trauma. The only experience that this can be likened to is a war. We will need each other to make it through this.\n\nThank you again. x)",

When we go outside, she tries to put one on even if we are just going to the mailbox. She has never been to the park, the beach, the mountains, the zoo, the aquarium, she's almost never seen another baby in her life except on screens, she's never seen a restaurant or a shopping mall, we had to cancel every trip, every vacation, every birthday party for the last year and a half, we even had to cancel our trip to Disney that we had been saving up for since I got pregnant with her. I can't even take her shopping because people here refuse to mask up (AL), and every day her older brother goes to school there's a risk he will bring covid home (he's too young for the vaccine) and if my kids get it... I don't want to think about it. The schools are under reporting covid cases, they're not mandating anything to prevent the spread, and they're not offering *any* sort of virtual or hybrid classes to deal with this. Oh, and my husband's mental health has taken a massive hit since he got laid off in 2020. He was suicidal a few months ago, which was fucking scary. Also I lost 3 loved ones last year and I may as well have told people my fish had died. My brother in law died in November and my managers were thumbing through manuals before I even finished my sentence, to see if I should be allowed off to attend the funeral. Thankfully it was on my day off. But still, how fucked is that, that your employer can tell you which family members are worth a day or two of bereavement, and which ones aren't? \n\n\nThis shit has been going on so long that I feel like *everyone* is suffering from compassion fatigue. Twenty years ago we collectively stopped everything, and mourned over 2,000 people who were killed in a single day during the world trade center attacks. But that number is every day now, and we are too burnt out to even acknowledge it. After 18 months, we hear the numbers on the news, we sigh, and we get back to work. The callousness of it all is overwhelming. You've got millions dropping like flies and we are all just going about our business like it's a regular Tuesday. And there's no compassion for those who are struggling. Even with the vaccine coming out, nothing has really improved our situation because not nearly enough people are taking it. We have needed help for so long, this has been an emergency for *so long*, that the alarm bells that have been going off for 18 months have become white noise in the background of society. You can't even get done reading one tragic article before another one is published with an even worse tragedy, \"the virus is killing people!\" \"Child abuse cases skyrocket!\" \"Someone did another mass shooting in a shopping mall!\" \"Hey look, the virus mutated *again*, and *this* strain makes your eyeballs melt and your tongue swell to the size of a grapefruit!\" \"We're running out of food! We're running out of clean water!\" \"Homelessness is at an all time high!\" \"Look how this natural disaster fucked up this area!\" \"Rent is going up and the minimum wage still hasn't budged!\" And of course: \"Climate change will take us all out very soon, but *what about the economy?*\" \n\n\n....It's like we are all working in a burning building and management is telling everyone to stay calm and keep working, and half of the company is yelling \"are you crazy? Put the fucking fire out you're gonna get us all killed!\" And the other half is yelling \"the fuck? We can't stop *everything* just to put the fire out, do you know what that would do to our production schedule?!\" And then management is saying \"ughh if you're SO concerned with the \"fire\" then just keep a fire extinguisher on your person.\" And then you've got half the employees saying \"I have a fire extinguisher and a big bucket of water but WE SHOULD REALLY PUT OUT THE FIRE\" and then you've got the other half saying \"you can't make me tote around a fire extinguisher all day! I have rights!\" But then the fire gets on THEM and they start spreading it around more and begging for the fire extinguisher but it's too late...",

It's shown that when push comes to shove we absolutely will knowingly hurt others over something as trivial as preferring not to wear a thin piece of cloth over our faces, or get a little shot. It's shown that our leaders are more than willing to sacrifice the lives of those they lead for political points. It's shown that even the most altruistic of world leaders will prefer to hoard vaccines over sending them to places like Africa. It shows that when husbands and wives spend too much time together at home, a lot of them end up becoming super abusive. It shows that left to our own devices, most of us will drink ourselves into a stupor, fall into a deep depression, or worse. Ultimately, covid has shown that our problem as a species is not that we don't have the resources to deal with big problems, it's that we absolutely do have the answers and resources to fix everything, we simply refuse to use them.\n\nWe've got bigger global issues coming up in the future to deal with. Climate change, for example. How do you think we're going to deal with it? Before covid, I had a feeling that we might drag our feet for a while but eventually pull together and overcome it before it got the better of us. Now, I'm not so sure.",

They have also become more selective about which patients they will accept, and many are reluctant to accept patients they think are likely to be “complicated”, simply because they don’t have enough staff. So people who need psych hospitalization end up waiting in emergency rooms for placement for days and sometimes weeks. Most ERs do not have capacity to meet mental health needs and they can’t offer that type of treatment. So these patients are literally sitting in a tiny room staring at white walls for weeks which makes their symptoms worse. The ER staff gets overwhelmed with holding them, so these patients are getting discharged before they have gotten any actual treatment.

The news, politicians, and public health figures almost exclusively talk about covid as it pertains to hospitalizations and deaths, as if those are the only bad outcomes that accompany covid. \n\nLong covid is complete hell. And it can crop up many months after your acute infection and debilitate you much more than getting sick with covid does. My acute infection with covid (March 2020) felt like a bout of the flu - so not fun, but not super worrying. But long haul covid has utterly kicked the shit out of me with fatigue, brain fog, exercise intolerance, inability to focus, chest pain, heart palpitations, orthostatic intolerance, intense stomach pain, and so much more. Pretty much every related symptom except shortness of breath and pulmonary issues. At one point my appetite was so poor that I lost 20 lbs in 3 months while doing almost no activity. \n\nI've had these symptoms for the last 7.5 months. Some people have been dealing with it for nearly 2 whole years. We have no idea if we're ever going to recover or when that might be. I used to be healthy as a horse and without a care in the world; now I feel fragile and have pretty bad medical anxiety. I'm young and have (had) a busy life that's been completely upended. \n\nThis whole experience has also caused me to lose almost all the respect I have for medical professionals. Not one of the doctors (primary care or urgent care) or specialists (cardiologist, neurologist, endocrinologist, pulmonologist, gastroenterologist) that I've seen so far knows what the problem is, and none of them are interested in helping me solve the issues or conduct any exploratory testing. People who have been trained for years in specialized and general medical science are surprisingly useless when it comes to diseases that aren't in their textbooks. It's incredibly frustrating and scary. \n\nThe worst part for society is that long-term symptoms from covid are common. Prevalence estimates for long haul covid range from 10% of cases to nearly 1/3 of all people infected with covid. And vaccines do not prevent you from developing long haul covid. This is the burden that is going to overwhelm the healthcare system in tandem with covid for the foreseeable future, and as more people get infected with covid more people are going to develop these long term issues.",

Burnout and suicide among healthcare workers are at all-time highs. \n\nThere is a massive shortage of nurses in most states. Many times \"shortages of hospital beds\" actually means they cannot find nurses to staff the areas and have to close rooms or wings as a result. There are actual beds but no one to take care of a patient in the bed.\n\nMany who have decades of experience retired early due  to the risk to their own and their familues' health. They were replaced by brand new, sometimes not-yet-licensed nurses. And there are few left to mentor the new nurses.\n\nResidency training suffered as in-person rotations were cancelled or modified. Many residents missed out practicing essential skills as hospitals were overwhelmed with patients and attendings were occupied with an onslaught of sick people.\n\nWe will be dealing with the repercussions of this for years to come. Some keep chugging along but many are sacrificing their own mental health to provide care for (mostly unvaccinated) patients in this latest wave. I predict that when all is said and done, there will be a lot of PTSD in the healthcare community due to all the witnessed death and fear for their own lives that has been ongoing for 18 months now, with no end in sight.",

When in say 20 years there are no more reasons to go outside anymore, everybody is going to experience huge health issues (mental, lack of exercise), birth rates are going to decrease even further (which creates a plethora of social issues), and people will live an overall more boring life. \n\nI can already work from home and get any food/necessities delivered to my place, and in the future even hobbies will be virtual too, as online hobbies are going to get even better overtime and the companies offering in-person products and services would rather cut the unnecessary cost of renting a now unneeded place. Why would I go out, then? How am I going to meet anybody in-person, knowing full-well that is something crucial given that humans are social beasts? After the pandemic we all know that is no way to live on the long run, but that's the future of humanity that was kickstarted by COVID.\n\nAnd this development will also affect the businesses and reasons to go out that are 100% in-person. It's much easier to go to a restaurant once you have already left the house for whatever reason (work) than to make it a special occasion, therefore people are going to go out to restaurants less. Or thinking even 50 years in the future, lots of people are going to do their tourism at home, as VR gaming is going to have one to one fidelity.\n\n2.- COVID also increased social inequities as a whole, which will have a snowball effect in the future. \"Essential businesses\" happened to be all of the larger ones, which drove smaller companies out of business. Post-COVID landlords are making bank without moving a finger, all the while renters and aspiring owners are fucked now that prices are increasing like crazy. And as the medium and lower classes are struggling to survive, then the taxes they already pay cannot be raised in order to combat the increasing social inequalities, so it's going to inevitably get worse.\n\nThe big ones get always bigger; that's natural and it happens in every economic system. However, due to rising inequities, in the future the smaller ones are going to get so small that they won't be able to even dream of becoming big themselves.",

I can't do this anymore.\n\nI made a post a few weeks ago about my own abusive stepdad who won his award, and how I cremated him. After seeing the recent post from a funeral director, I wanted to add my perspective to go along with theirs.   \n\n\nI've been in the funeral business for about a decade, and have spent most of that time working the crematory. My crematory does not just cremate for our funeral home, but it cremates for several surrounding funeral homes who contract their cremations out to us since they do not have their own machine. So I see a lot of dead people. A LOT.    \n\n\nBefore the news stories broke about the 2nd wave, or the 4th wave, or whatever wave we are on now, I already knew well beforehand because I had already seen the hundreds of bodies pile up.  I remember telling my girlfriend and my family \"be prepared, it's back, and it's worse.\"    \n In my almost decade of working here, I have never seen anything like this, we are doing literally double the amount of business and it just doesn't stop.  We have a very large walk-in cooler that can hold about 50 to 60 people, it filled up very quickly so we had to rent a refrigerated tractor trailer, which also filled up very quickly so we got another one.  I've been working like 13 hour days 8 days in a row,  splitting the day in half with my coworker who is doing the same thing. So we are running basically 24/7.  We've been cremating about 200 people a month (pre-pandemic we were doing 100)  Almost all of them are positive with covid.    \n\n\nIt has been exhausting.  It's a literal hellscape.  I simply can't do it anymore.  I quit this week. Everyone is quitting. My body and my mind and my soul are all exhausted and the company hasnt raised our pay despite my company admitting to making like a billion extra dollars from the pandemic.  I have shown up to work every day because if I didn't then bodies would literally pile up even worse than they are.  I have felt a strong dedication to being one of the people who keeps the wheels of society turning during this pandemic by working with all of it's dead.  People simply aren't seeing this, it's all behind closed doors, so these people who think covid is a hoax are blind and ignorant to it but I can assure you it is real and it is hell on earth. Bodies everywhere with no end in sight.  I don't know if I will be out of the funeral business forever after this, but I just can't do it anymore.\n\nEDIT:  A lot of people are asking what state I'm at, I don't really want to say because there are only so many crematories in a given state, but I will say I'm in a large metropolitan area in the deep South.\n\nThis post blew up so another edit: \n\nYes I asked for higher pay, many times. I found a better job months ago and I start it this week. \n\nYes you can get covid from a dead body but it's highly unlikely because they don't breath and only after they recently passed. It dies out usually in a few hours to a day. \n\nNo, I never said the rate of death doubled. I said the amount I'm cremating has doubled. \nThis is because everyone is dying at one time,  Whereas before the pandemic deaths were spread out mostly evenly throughout the year, but during this pandemic everyone is dying at the same time and we just don't have the infrastructure or manpower to deal with it. \n\nAnd, I love my job. I did this job because it gave me a sense of importance, like I was helping people in dark moments. But I didn't sign up for the fucking plague. I stayed as long as I could but for my own well-being I have to leave.\n\nLast edit: No I will not take pictures of dead bodies. Not only is it illegal, but unethical. These are people's loved ones and I don't think they would want to be on display. \nYes, I would like for people to face the dark reality of this so that they will take it seriously but all I can share is my story. \nThank you everyone for the kind words. I'm no hero, I'm just a worker, like the rest of us, I just happened to be closer to the fire, literally.",

No two cases are the same of course but it seems that they were already under so much strain, so much struggle, so exhausted and overwhelmed - and that was when they had some semblance of a support network. During lockdown most or all of that stopped, overnight. No respite care, no schools, no groups or classes where they could go and speak to maybe the only adults they’d see that week. No help, no social workers, no break - and no one to shoulder any of the burden. Often their children required intensive round-the-clock care and there was no one but them to provide it, with no end in sight. They were tired, theu were forgotten, they were out of options and they were broken. In contrast to domestic abuse situations I don’t think any of these women killed in anger.

When applying for life insurance which is basically a savings account for when you retire (whole life) or can be used to cover the exorbitant costs of dying should you pass away unexpectedly, often times you are required to go through a series of health tests to make sure you don't have any preexisting conditions which may affect your coverage or may raise your rates. What is stopping these life insurance companies from putting a clause into your life insurance that states in the event of a pandemic, if your death is brought about due to reckless behavior (refusing to mask, refusing the vaccine) that your policy is considered null and void. What if you pass away due to complications from having survived covid years later (like heart failure) and they deny your coverage because you refused a vaccine. Your loved ones will be left with the bill for your burial, cremation, services, flowers, coffin, ashes container, etc. because you refused to get the shot. When my own father passed away years ago, the costs of having to lay him to rest began IMMEDIATELY and the life insurance took months to settle. I received a personal loan from my mother (his ex wife) for cremation, flowers, memorial service, urns, catering, paying remaining bills. If the head of household or breadwinner dies they are basically plunging their family and anyone or anypet into poverty without life insurance coverage. Suddenly a lifelong housewife must find a job to support herself and the kids, suddenly your eldest in college needs to quit school to support themselves. Suddenly your elderly mother needs to move into a home and relinquish all their possessions to be able to afford it.\nPeople ought to know that there is more at risk than just their lives, but it could bankrupt their children and loved ones.",

In April they had a horrific outbreak and 40 people died.  I had not physically been able to go in the building since March 17th. She survived that situation, but was evacuated in the middle of the night.  They sent everyone to different hospitals.  They did it at night so less press, and none of the loved ones were notified ( I was her POA) I  finally found her 5 days later in a hospital ( by phone only( She was TERRIFIED) She didn't have her glasses, hearing aides, dentures. She couldn't see, hear, or eat solid foods.  She ended up in a facility ( the other 1 shutdown for months, but we would not let her go back there anyway bc they HID the COVID cases thus the outbreak) She ended up being the FIRST resident to COVID there, but was asymptomatic.  She was in the COVID ward for months, but finally made it back to her private room.  I still could not physically see her and phone calls became more and more difficult because they were short staffed and I needed them to get the phone to her. After 15 months I FINALLY got to go in her room. It was disgusting.  $10,000 rent and her room was FILTHY  and she was clearly being neglected.  I got to go in 3 more times before she ended up being admitted to a hospital.  5 days later she was admitted to a hospice and died 😥😥😥exactly 2 weeks later. She had a STAGE FOUR WOUND, SEVERE UTI, SEVERE SEPSIS AND SEVERE MALNUTRITION 😥😥😥😥😥  I feel the neglect was from the staff being incredibly short staffed and stressed from COVID. I KNOW in my heart if I could have been able to see her this would not have happened.  Just the isolation alone was really bad for her because of her anxiety.  Knowing she was laying in that place being neglected is more than I can accept some days. I miss her so much. She's not the only family member we lost that was in a nursing home.

I mean it was like the whole city shut down, and you could feel the ground move & hear the chants for blocks away as the sounds bounced & echoed through the streets between buildings. \n\nEither way activism in one field leads to another due to intersectionality, but yeah I find that most often outside of the city that since most people are white, their first dive into activism is Environmentalism, Animal abuse, Climate Change, Veganism, & then soft Feminism. \n\nI just feel like Covid killed climate strike movements & in a way that kinda made the idea of challenging the status quo seem more radical in association to everything else. So like the margin of performative or like an foot in the door to full-on conscious has shifted dramatically; which effects the rate at which someone from a more conservative/moderate environment like the suburbs would turn to challenge things since they’d be more repelled now. Like climate change is such an easier to grasp issue, where as systemic issues are far more intricate & would come off as wild conspiracies to anyone who’s never personally witnessed said experiences. I’ve met more Republicans that genuinely care ab recycling than much more abrasive to their comfort/reality issues.\n\nSo idk if it helped in the sense that it made the intricate stuff more discouraging which made simpler topics feel smaller & more palatable or the latter (made them more menacing by association)",

Most every Imaging study from covid patients gives me a little panic attack, because of how severe it is, and I expect the patient to deteriorate rapidly. However around 75% of the time that’s not the case. If you google covid chest X-ray or covid ct, and compare it to a pneumonia ct or X-ray the amount of inflammation and lung involvement is out of proportion to what we typically see in a normal pulmonary disease. Now this inflammation just like any other part of your body translates to scar tissue over time. Meaning your spongey pliable lung tissue because hard, stiff and doesn’t perfume oxygen across its surface as well as healthy lung tissue. And once pulmonary fibrosis sets in, it’s a slow insidious death process which has no good treatment. Currently there’s no good management to halt the progression of fibrosis. And once it actually sets in the person has a high likelihood of being debilitated and will require constant oxygen and be tethered to it. And once you’re reliant on oxygen this puts stress on your heart, and limits your activity ability so chf and obesity will soon be an issue as well.

My parents and I live in Florida. My mother struggled when we learned he caught it due to his own ignorance disbelief of the virus. He even exposed others before being hospitalized. We didn’t know that until after he died. Not even 4 days later a cousin of mine passed away from cancer that had metastasized. We weren’t even talking much about the cousin who was sick because we’d been so focused on the needless loss of my brother-in-law. At the beginning of the pandemic we also lost my uncle (father of cousin with cancer). \n\nMy mother admitted to her siblings that she was having a difficult time dealing with her conflicted emotions. Instead of comforting her or saying nothing at all, they responded in defense of their own ignorant beliefs about the virus. \n\nThere had been some cracks in the family over the second Obama term and the Trump term election cycles, but this is by far the worst I’ve seen division in my family. \n\nWhile my brother-in-law was in the hospital 8 members of my family had Covid.

No phone calls to family or rec, just 15 minutes for a shower then back in your cell. I was at a reception center for the first 84 days of the pandemic so we didn’t have much. We weren’t told when we would be leaving to our next institution. If you got quarantined, you won’t talk or jpay your family for at least a month. But the way the prison staff treated us was fucking insane. In 6 years I’ve never seen more violent confrontation between inmates and staff.

That’s 0.2% of the entire population just wiped out and an extra 25% more to the total mortality rate for the year.\n\nAnd those deaths have NOT been distributed equally. Before the adoption of vaccines, deaths were primarily elderly folks with comorbidities, but now? It’s rural communities of unvaccinated individuals (who trend 50 to 75) that are being hit the hardest, due to a lack of adequate access and public resistance. \n\nMortality amongst those under 50 has remained relatively steady but over half of all COVID deaths are now among those 50 to 74, a complete turn around from last year where is was majority 75+. \n\nMore and more, a person dying of Covid has a higher chance of being white than any other race (over 28% of deaths amongst those over 50 are white). \n\n30 to 49 year olds of all races have seen a giant decrease in deaths, beaten out by the 75+ and Asians under 30 (who have seen an incredible 100% decrease in COVID morbidity since last year). \n\nAnd if you overlay a map of party preference with vaccination rates and deaths per capita, red counties are being hit much harder at this point in the pandemic than blue ones.\n\nThis virus is shifting the demographics of this country *dramatically* and it’s hard to tell how it’s going to shakeout in the election next year. We could be looking at some significant changes to agenda priorities.

She was of pretty sound mind before COVID, but her family said the fear of the pandemic and isolation had started to wear on her. She was showing slight, subtle signs of mental decline, but nothing dramatic. Her family was looking into COVID-safe care options since this was towards the early days of the pandemic and a nursing home was not an option. Family and friends stayed in contact as much as possible, but then one day, she stopped answering her phone. The police were immediately called for a welfare check, and I am absolutely not going to share the dirty details, but they confirmed it was a suicide. She was an old-school, religious woman that believed suicide was murder, so it was quiet the shock to everyone. The early stages of dementia made her anxiety about the pandemic worse, and she had been complaining of COVID like symptoms in the prior days. The family believes she was either getting it or a something similar (cold, allergies, etc) and her mental state drove her to take matters into her own hands. I had lived around her and a lot of her family since the day I was born. She was the funniest, wittiest lady I had ever met. I used to go to her house and sit with her, and she would tell me such interesting and intense stories from her life, having lived in Europe from like the late 40s-early 60s.

I am an epidemiologist specializing in infectious diseases so I *know* how critical it is to isolate, social distance, and vaccinate to protect yourself and others. I have complied 100% with every restriction and lockdown thrown my way. I didn’t see my family in over a year (apart from distanced parking lot visits). Neither have I seen my friends in 18 months. I have been cooped up inside with my partner and 3 pets for 18 months.\n\nThe past few months have been rough on my mental health. I was pretty fine before that (I even enjoyed some of it since I’m very antisocial haha). I understand all of the restrictions up until now. But I believe that now we really need to focus on peoples’ mental health and financial positions. We have extremely effective vaccines available to us. 99% of people over the age of 12 (or 18) can and should get vaccinated. Yet, we are always under the threat of lockdown due to the X% of idiots who won’t get vaccinated. Not only that, but they overwhelm our healthcare systems so other people cannot get the treatment or surgeries they need. The threat of yet another lockdown puts me and a lot of people in a dark place. I can’t do it again. It’s at this point, where a VERY effective prevention is available to us, that leaders need to start focusing on things like mental health and financial security.",

Every time you go out of your room, the asshole makes snide remarks about you or says all sorts of bad things. You on the other hand, can't really fight back because this asshole married into your family and doing so will cause drama and you want to keep peace. In order to avoid the daily asshole, you changed your eating habit and started eating at midnight so that you won't have to go out of your little room during the day. You end up taking all of the daily verbal and non-verbal abuse for more than an entire year.\n\n- For some reason, talking about the vaccine's side effects that you experienced gets you branded as \"anti-vax\", even if you obviously got vaccinated and that's why you're talking about it. People have become too tribal about this vaccine. Instead of treating it as a vaccine, people have been treating it as some kind of political statement. \"I am democrat, therefore I should take the vaccine! All republicans are anti-vax, evil!\" says the blue people. Medicine, vaccines, treatments, they should never be political at all. These are the things that can either keep you alive or make you dead. Politicians don't give a damn whether you live or die so instead of showing loyalty to your party by getting medical treatment or vaccines, you have to do it for yourself!\n\n- The politicization of the vaccine ended up destroying friendships and families. This made me realize that people value political tribalism more than friends or family. Why? Is it because it's easier to get compliments, praise, and acceptance from more people if you show you belong to a certain political side online? This is very sad. You should value your friends and family more than mere politics. These politicians will tell you everything you want to hear but they'll never give you a second look once they've gotten your vote and you try to hold them accountable for breaking their promises. Friends and family will always be there for you. You should really think about where you invest your love and loyalty in.\n\n- Because of the virus, people ended up using \"ZOOM\" to work online. This means that your face is the focus of the camera and everybody sees you all the time. Have you ever thought about shy people? Have you ever thought about people who don't like being the center of attention? Have you ever thought about people who are extremely conscious about their face? If you're fat you think \"OH FUCK, THEY'LL SEE MY DOUBLE/TRIPLE CHIN FOR AS LONG AS WE WORK LIKE THIS!\" or as in the case of that CNN Toobin guy \"OH SHIT, THEY CAUGHT ME JACKING OFF, LIVE ON THE NET!\" Instead of the good old days when you simply did your job without anyone every staring at your face, now you work knowing that everyone's eyes can see your face all the time.

I don't know if that meant there were more cyclists reporting road rage or if there were more incidents per cyclist. At least some of those incidents killed people. For example, one driver crossed oncoming traffic to plow into a group of cyclists, killing 5 of them. The driver ended up in a shootout with police. \n\nHonestly, it's a good thing people are cycling more, but cities here weren't prepared for the increase because we don't have the proper infrastructure for it, so I'm certain there was more interaction between cars and cyclists, and that's not good.",

YES, there is a problem that can negatively affect many people from a health perspective, but more than anything it seems to have become a \"you against me\" sort of thing.  How about we all just take a moment to realize that some people are really frightened of this virus and some people are not. Those that are should do everything they can to feel like they've made themselves safer, and those that are not should go about their lives, but try to be kind to the people that are afraid.  I'm not saying anyone should kowtow to the other, but how difficult is it to give everyone their \"rights\"?  Mine don't trump yours, and yours certainly don't trump mine.

Psychological studies show definitively that if young children aren't socialized properly with other children, their chances of becoming antisocial or developing social anxiety/social disorders as they get older skyrockets.\n\nIt doesn't seem like it, but socializing with other children is in no uncertain terms one of the most essential parts of a young brains development, if they don't get this stimulus then the behavioral part of the brain falls behind the other kids and remains under developed almost indefinitely.\n\nTo put it another way. If you have just turned 4 and you haven't been socialized all year due to lock-down, you still have the behavior of a 3 year old when it comes to interacting with other children. \nBut a well socialized 4 year old will not play with another 4 year old who acts like a 3 year old. They just avoid them. And a well socialized 5 year old will *definitely* not play with another 5 year old who acts like a 3 year old. So the kids that fell behind end up stuck behind. Its a runaway problem that has no solution other than to hope they re-adjust as they get older and catch up.\n\nWe are going to see a huge generation of mental health issues in about 15 years when all these young kids who never got a chance to socialize due to lock-downs and school being closed grow into adults.\n\nIm already seeing it in my partners Nephew.

That’s all well and good but, seriously, this kid does not understand how to function socially/in a Covid world because being sheltered is basically all they know. They are okay around their main teacher but are extremely skittish around any other teachers (like art and gym). They’ve cried and had meltdowns on the playground outside because they were encouraged to play with others but all they want is to be right next to the teacher out of security. Evidently one of the other kids didn’t have a mask on for a hot second and this kid not only told on them, but their actual words were “He’s not wearing his mask, he has Covid he needs to go home.”\n\nGenerally speaking a lot of the young kids are understanding of the rule that masks help not to spread germs so we want to wear them, and they do so without much issue. But this poor kid and others like them who have been, in a way, overprotected throughout this pandemic are not going to be coping well with the eventual changes back to “normal.”",

And from March until late may suffered “psychotic episodes” extreme panic attacks, nightmares etc. It doesn’t sound super serious when written, but what happened to me is beyond describing, and was and still is the greatest pain I’ve gone through. Of which I’m still heavily traumatised from. During those months I was bed bound the entire way. And by the end of it I had already missed 6 months of my year 10 which for me where I live is THE most important year. Furthermore other consequences followed after the psychotic episodes ended. Extreme iron deficiency, memory loss, extreme fatigue and tiredness, anxiety, prolonged periods of sadness, and simply not functioning at 100%. Every simple task was a marathon. Even now, leaning over puts my back in agony. It’s, it’s horrible. And i still cannot think or talk about what happened much because it just hurts and I cry, there’s a lot more to it. Furthermore, by may I had missed the majority of my year 10, having the parts before 2021 been in lockdown, and the entirety of my year 9 in lockdown. So mentally I’m unwell, physically I’m unwell and academically too, of which didn’t help either. I still haven’t gotten the proper help I need. GPS don’t listen, and doctors are so full constantly, so I’m suffering in year 11, basically just getting on with it. Forcing myself to exist and do all the work. Every day at school is an utter challenge and I can barely last to the end of the day for being exhausted. And my metal state is also awful. I’m just in a lot of pain, and the doctors aren’t listening, and my mental state is worsening and I might get put on even more meds as well because of another mri where I might get diagnosed with something else. It’s always another blood test, scan, but not someone who can tell me why I can no longer remember properly, or what is wrong with me and my metal state. Or help catch up a whole years worth of school in 5 months as I’m in year 11 and I haven’t got enough time left. Sorry this became a rant. Your incredible if you read all this.",

A generation that can ill afford it.\n\n\nWe're running smack dab into an energy crisis, a water crisis, an environmental crisis and now a pandemic on top of it. \n\n\nHere's the very real effects we can expect:\n\n\n1) Inflation, we're already seeing it, but free money to stay home will increase prices, as will massive downturns in productivity due to COVID protocols. Right now we're still largely buoyed by low interest rates and economic lethargy, but at some point shit is going to get real expensive real fast. \n\n\n2)  Increased healthcare costs. We're already seeing it, but  COVID has cost the healthcare system billions 200-300 per year so far. The cost to the individual is equally staggering. To put it in perspective a heart attack is about 6X cheaper than COVID if you end up in ICU. Many healthcare systems that were close to breaking points have or will break. Leading to a lowering lifespan among other issues. \n\n\n3) Decreased productivity. We're already experiencing that, testing, isolation and strain on the individual is dramatically lowering productive output. People who might never take a sick day are cashing them all out to quarantine, or care for loved ones. Also let's not forget the roughly 700k dead, a lot of those people were still participating in the economy and conservatively about 10X that number are 'long haulers' who've been unable to return to work.  That's a lot of small businesses without staff or management.\n\n\nIn short, expect things to get more expensive at a faster rate than wages will rise. Expect items will remain in short supply for the foreseeable future, expect economic uncertainty and it's kissing cousins war and strife to increase.",

Nearly a year of virtual school, lax education requirements (because 'they're online and it's tough and we have to give them some slack'), and parents not supporting their kids (either by neglecting to make sure they're online, or just outright doing the work for them so the kid doesn't learn anything because the parent is doing the work) has caused a standstill in education, especially among elementary school kids. And while we can get kids back on track, there's only so much that can be done without pumping lots of money into education programs. So the rich kids will get the support to catch up on all the learning they missed, while the poor kids will just perpetually be behind.",

Most parents aren't well versed in early childhood or just didn't have the time (on top of their work life, older school age children and family things) to work with the little ones. It is the young ones that are often stuck in front of the TV or metaphorically pushed aside because \"its only preschool\". In reality early childhood is the foundation of so many milestones and life skills. So many children  coming in have speech delays, gross motor delays and behavior issues. We have even seen a 4year fall into a depression as she did virtual sessions with us. Her mother brought her back to preaschool mid pandemic despite working from home because she was so afraid of the drastic shift in her daughters personality. The speech delays and behavior delays are very alarming as well. Children with absolutely no speech at all which leads to a slew of issues. Not blaming the parents.

These dogs also weren’t socialized with other dogs or people so they are all neurotic. It also means that many more people demanding appointments for their pets. The industry already had a lot of issues with staff turnover and burnout and these have just been exasperated. Hospitals are having to shorten their hours, there’s less staff, and people are being turned away for same day appointments. Even the emergency hospitals are turning patients away and closing at night. And a lot of people are getting really nasty with hospital staff. We’re double or even triple booked some days because people feel bad turning away sick pets. This means wait times skyrocket, team members don’t get a lunch break and it’s a joke of you think they get to leave anywhere close to their scheduled time off. And to top it off, a lot of hospitals are still curbside. That means when it’s 100 degrees, or thunder storming, or the wind is ripping shingles off the roof out I’m still outside. And people always seem to have something incredibly important to say as soon as it starts down pouring. Staff is underpaid for the job and the Best Buy across the street pays $5 more an hour starting than the average pay for a vet assistant or a receptionist. This means there’s no new people coming in, because they’re sane and won’t do the job for shit pay, shit working conditions, and a shitty work life balance. I’ve had so many friends from hospitals across the country leave the industry because all of the above was the final straw. There’s been so many veterinary professionals that have taken their lives in the last year, almost everyone knows someone in the industry that has committed suicide.

At the time, some nurses were refusing to come in to work because of the lack of a mask mandate, and this forced the hospital staff to get shuffled to keep it functioning. \n\nUnfortunately, the nature of COVID is that people are panicking once they show any symptoms. Minor symptoms are supposed to be treated with vitamins, Tylenol, a baby aspirin 81mg if you can take it, and lots of rest. But, they think they'll die because they have a cough, and now must be cycled into exam rooms to protect the test of the ER from catching their crap. This means exam rooms are taken by varying severity COVID/Flu (yes the flu still exists, too) patients and we have to work them up to clear them out. It also means that COVID infected are supposed to be quarantined until 3 negative tests come back.\n\nER exam rooms take an hour to decontaminate after infectious disease exposure. All of this, coupled with understaffing, specialists having to fill general medicine gaps, people overreacting to minor infections while staying at home for the major ones that need hospitalization, which is an interesting and sad paradox, and maxed hospital room capacity meant that a recently wed couple having a baby ended up with the mother losing her life after being dilated for so long. The baby was able to be saved, but nobody should have to experience the trauma of this. \n\nThe dude found his soulmate and lost her because... why? What is the excuse? Fully-vaccinated nurses in full PPE refusing to come in to work despite the hospital providing masks to all patients in the ER capable of wearing them? Because of public overreaction and lack of education about what to actually do if infected? I scrutinize this because I've seen it first-hand as a nurse aide. We lost a lot of the amazing nurses to the virus at the beginning of the pandemic, and are left with a much higher percentage of nurses doing it for the money instead of to help others. My 67 year old neighbor had a Doctorate of Nursing and went back to work past year. She was dead 2 months later. I truly fear for hospital care for the next decade.\n\nWhatever the true cause is; a man lost his wife, and their newborn daughter is all he has left. This was all preventable.

Depression on its own is exhausting, physically and mentally speaking, but the almost 24/7 parade of suicidal/homicidal thoughts running through my head? They’re even worse. The pandemic hasn’t been kind to anyone (outside of the already massively wealthy CEOs who have continued to squeeze every last drop of profit out of their overworked, underpaid employees while COVID-19 kills them) but it’s been especially unkind to those who were already struggling. Whether that struggle was mental, emotional, or physical, the pandemic said “Fuck you!” and made it 100x worse. \n\nAnd I’m at the point where I can’t take it anymore. It sucks. The hospital I’m doing my clinical rotation at is filled with the sounds of alarms going off and patients gasping for air. I’m not even finished with college yet, and I’m burnt out on nursing already. None of us are equipped to deal with this, even the veteran nurses who have worked longer than we’ve been alive are struggling with their new responsibilities. I never expected to watch so many people die. My plan was to get through clinicals, get my degree, pass my NCLEX, get my license, and work at my local family clinic. The worst thing I was supposed to deal with was a fussy kid who didn’t want to get their flu shot. \n\nNot this. \n\nNever this. \n\nIt’s heartbreaking. Jesus Christ, it fucking hurts every time I have to go into the hospital. We had a fucking baby die from COVID recently. A baby. He was just a year old, and nobody knows what to do anymore because we were all told from the start that COVID “only kills the elderly”. And that hurt bad enough, but you could sort of rationalize it. You know? \n\nThey’re older, they’ve lived their lives and gotten to fall in love and go to college and start a family of their own and rescue animals and master their hobbies and listen to music and go to concerts and watch movies and have picnics under the stars and live. And it’s still heartbreaking every single time we have an elderly patient die in our hospital, even knowing all that. \n\nBut babies? Little one year old babies who can barely talk outside of simple, one and two syllable words? It isn’t fair. How do you tell parents that their baby died? How can you comfort them? You can’t.",

With my infection and subsequent, disability level, long covid it came back, hard, so I took a phycological evaluation which gave me a \"Major depressive disorder\" alongside various stress and anxiety disorders. I've not had a day where breathing isn't an issue. I've had headaches my whole life, but now I need to take special medications for it because they're so consistently bad, otherwise I'd take so much ibuprofen my stomach bleeds (which was the reason for one of the hospital visits). I'm always dizzy, and when it gets real bad I'm always on the border of fainting, and have, twice in public now. I've lost 70 LBS while hardly changing my diet, and I'm still losing weight. The brain fog is so awful that this took me... like, 3 times as long to write than it otherwise would have, and my general confusion makes me feel far dumber than I otherwise would. I've had days where I drive past my own house and wonder why the hell I'm driving the direction I am. Stomach issues, gut fuckery, almost like I'm eating nothing but taco bell from Chernobyl, when it's just fresca and corn chips. I understand that I'm part of a small group of people dealing with severe long haul issues post covid infections, and it's still early on as far as knowing what's going on with this virus, but I get the sneaking suspicion that people like me will be just swept under the rug and sort of forgotten because people want to move on from all this so damn badly. The suffering the nurses and medical professionals are going through, factory workers and warehouse employees, everybody just wants to stop thinking about it, and us, so they can pretend all this just never happened. Then there's folks like me, I get the feeling we'll get lumped in with all the antivaxer morons, just so people can call us idiots, say we deserve what we get, put this all in a little bow and move on... \"I got sick because I didn't get the vaccine\" they'll say, not because I was working to help keep the linemen on the streets, and there was no vaccine available, as was the case... Then again, maybe I'm a pessimist, and maybe people do care! But if my current situation is any indication, lots of people like me are just gonna be kicked to the curb, like always. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: I was working 8 hours of manual labor, writing for 3 hours, drinking half a bottle of vodka, and dancing all night. Now, I can shower, make a half hour phone call, maybe pick up my pills, and I'll end up absolutely blitzed for the day thanks to Long Covid. I fear I, and a bunch of people like me, will be swept under the rug so everyone can \"move on from Covid\" and back to normal.",

There’s a lot of blaming the victim (“did you really get vaccinated? Doubtful if you got that sick.” Or “you must not’ve worn a mask or washed your hands,” etc). Or the opposite: “If I had Covid, I would beat that shit in 24 hours.” My supposed best friend actually texted me that. And then got pissed when I didn’t respond. I was passed out in bed, moreover, what is one supposed to say to that? “Congratulations on beating your imaginary virus, you’re way stronger than me.”",

Everyone talks about losing a business - I’m certainly not the only one, but having bi-polar disorder and ADHD as well as a teenage daughter with clinical depression and suicidal ideation and a teenage son with type 1 diabetes, losing my business and my life savings just broke me.  I feel like I spent a year and a half being skinned down to my core.  That’s the part no one wants to talk about.  It didn’t matter at all to landlords who illegally evicted us and screwed us out of our equipment - simply because they could.  Multi-millionaire psychiatrist who opened a third office building during Covid smelled blood in the water and obliterated a small veteran owned business just because he could.  I was told “sometimes you have to put your big girl panties on.”  From a mental health “professional” so no one really wants to hear about how it affected those with mental illness.  And no one wants to talk about the people who got richer by torpedoing small businesses.  And then had the balls to post about people who get stuck in a victim mentality- made me his victim and then shamed me for it.  \n\nBut I’m still here.  Lesson learned.  And I’d rather be me than anyone else on the planet.  I will rise Like a Phoenix from the ashes because I absolutely insist on enjoying this life!\n\nEdit:  my kids and my husband (their step father) got closer than ever.  And we did truly enjoy being locked down together - lots of sobbing and laughing and loving.",

I know that kind of stuff happens every day, but it seemed so magnified when everybody was unable to escape their homes and their toxic family.  I actually saw more than one instance where someone would \"go dark\", making sure no one except for one or two confidante friends knew their whereabouts, to hide their tracks as they relocated (I was never one of those friends so I don't know what all exactly went on, but that's the gist of what I saw reported).  There were a lot of \"domestic disturbance\" reports evidently stemming from the lockdown stress, and tbh if I'd had my own car and a friend with whom to bunk for a night or two, I would've most likely ducked out after a familial incident resulted in me getting a decent concussion (I literally couldn't see straight or not feel dizzy/headache-y/nauseous for several days).

Another way to put it is \"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\n\nIf there was a way to prevent both at the same time, it would be have been a much better situation (although people would still come up with excuses not to have the quarantine). But the truth is that there is no solution that would accomidate both.",

My best advice is to travel to a different region of the US, while immunocompromised during a pandemic, to get some treatment. Then travel back home and start chemotherapy during a pandemic. This assumes they have the money / insurance / etc to travel to a different state, HUGE assumption. Otherwise, it's just watch, wait, hope, and treat symptoms. \n\nWe don't have beds, we don't have ventilators, we don't have ICU nurses / RTs, we don't have the things that let us help people. People are stuck at hospitals that don't feel comfortable treating their problems (especially for trauma). A colleague called me about an intracranial hemorrhage late last night to see if I thought the patient would do okay if they went home with a responsible adult. We don't have any beds to monitor them, we have to limit use of what resources we have, I thought it would probably be fine.

Courts are slammed if they've even reopened.\n\nI experienced traumatizing situations at my last workplace, where I was a temp in the months running up to the first Covid shutdown. Extremely traumatic sexual harassment by a full-time employee, threats by another full-time employee, heavy surveillance, a lot of punching down by other full-timers, and HR was the worst bully of all. They ignored all of our state's covid protocols and I was teased and harassed when I took them seriously and remained 6 feet from my team/wore a mask.\n\nI fell into a very deep depression. I couldn't find a therapist and didn't even have private space in my apartment to do online sessions if I had. So I did Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation instead because that's all I could get. The TMS center was basically a massive for-profit insurance scam.  The staff were very manipulative, which was difficult for me to figure out in my depressed state. The treatment caused a psychotic episode. When I asked the staff, they said, there was no way it could be the treatment. I was so scared and confused. Legally and ethically, they should have shut down my treatment. But they treated me like I was \"being dramatic\" and the nurse practitioner prescribed me an energy work podcast. I was still driving. I could have hurt myself or others. Months later, I discovered that TMS can cause manias and centers are warned about this when they buy the machines.  I also discovered that they were breaking multiple state laws, including their treatment of children for autism spectrum - which isn't medically sound or approved - and advertising it, which is definitely against the law.\n\nThen I moved into a slumlord property where they had lied to me about the apartment, it wasn't safe, it had black mold, it violated a ton of laws.\n\nIn all three of these horrible situations, I've tried to reach out to my state attorney's general, to therapists, to lawyers via my county's bar association, oversight orgs, the press.  Everyone's too busy or don't care. All of the responses I get are kind of half-ass or auto-messages.\n\nThe traumas themselves make me feel like I have an invisible hand over my mouth and a chokehold on my brain. I struggle to find the words and to even talk about it. Everything just shuts down. Trying push through it and report it all and get help, over and over, to no response... it's exhausting and... so awful.\n\nThe whole thing has made me feel so worthless and hopeless. My SO has noticed how different I am (\"angry all the time\" \"sad all the time\") and they think I have ptsd. I don't trust doctors anymore. I don't trust people not to manipulate me or take advantage of me. I have a lot of anxiety about finding a new job, made worse by the time gap and lack of references. Legally speaking, I think too much time has passed to actually get any justice.\n\nI don't feel like I can tell anyone I know, because I just hear, \"why don't/didn't you get a lawyer/therapist/tell someone/report it to X/why did you wait so long?\"\n\nI think this is what people say to feel like they're being nice, or don't know what to say. They have this naïve, blind trust in \"the system\" and in \"justice.\" It hurts though, because I tried so many times, to so many different people - the people you go to and got nothing. These are people who have never been there or maybe they have the privilege of access to a good lawyer. The trauma of the unavailability of justice is possibly more traumatizing than the incidents of trauma I'm trying to get justice from.\n\nI feel like I'm the figure in [The Scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream).\n\nThis is a time and environment in which scammers and criminals and crooks and bullies and abusers thrive. It scares me what horrors others must be experiencing and the emptiness they must be experiencing if they also have tried to get help.\n\n(Edit: and the dealership tried to scam me when I brought in my car for maintenance and I'm pretty sure my dentist, dermatologist, and my sleep specialist intentionally overprescribed, over-treated, and over-tested me... (but I can't trust that I'm not just paranoid?)... all of which would have been a bigger deal to me before Covid. At this point, I feel manipulated into submission.)\n\nEdit II: Thank you to everyone who read this and upvoted. That someone took the time to read this, it actually does mean a lot to me. I feel heard and validated. Maybe I'm not \"insane\" but the situation it. \"Hell is a place with no reason.\" Thank you for making me feel like I'm reasonable. \n\nI wish we (and everyone else who added on this post) could meet up for a really good soda or lunch or ice cream (virgin, because of the number of folks reporting their self-medication struggles.

At the time, it was the right thing to do, but now that the cases have dropped quite substantially, the government hasn't opened the hospitals for students. So now we have an entire generation of doctors on 4th year that have had zero clinical experience (we passed the first 2 years of med school, and then, when we started 3rd year, COVID hit), and are about to start 5th year med school WITHOUT having examined a single patient ever. Think about that. All our classes have been through zoom. We've gone through everything. Neurology, Ob/Gyn, Gastroenterology, etc without ever examining someone, or just interviewing a real patient for their clinical history. The consequences are fucking massive. When we graduate and start working for the health system, and the day comes when we fuck up (probably pretty soon in our careers) nobody’s going to come and say: “Oh, don’t worry that your patient died, we understand that your professional formation was mediocre, so hey, you're not responsible”. The patient will be affected, the responsibility will fall with us, and the lawsuits will come either way. And this problem is not exclusive to medical students. Nurses, kinesiologists, nutritionists, all the health professionals use the public hospitals for their professional formation, and all of us are being left without clinical practices.",

On top of that, people are around their animals 24/7 now and many of them are new, so they're panicked/noticing things and doing more activities that can cause illness or injury with their animals increasing the load on our profession more. On top on top of that, everyone is stressed with Covid, so they're angrier, needier, and with less available funds then they have ever been. As a result we're burning out at an insane rate. Emerg vets and techs are flocking to GP where the hours are better controlled, and GP's are booked out weeks in advance. We work very hard to find balance,  it's that or we leave the profession entirely, or kill ourselves (we already had a wicked suicide rate. My classmate tried to kill herself last week, and luckily survived, so perhaps I'm a little touchier about this than usual but it's an epidemic in it's own right). As a result people cannot get veterinary care for their animals. Our specialists are disappearing too.. I've had to euthanize more than one critical patient during this crappy pandemic because we had nowhere to send them to. That's not a nice conversation to have with the person who's willing to do anything, for the patient we could have helped. Nevermind the pandemic dogs produced by backyard breeders looking to capitalize on the market and charge you $3000+ for a dog with multiple medical issues that has never seen a vet. On that note, I would highly recommend if you don't have a GP to start searching, because you may not be able to get into an emerg clinic if you need it otherwise.",

The spring and summer wasn’t terrible. It was exhausting but fun and survivable. We all had burn out at summer’s end. Right at the end of summer was when things started to look bleak and we knew the kids weren’t going back to school. Being home 24/7 with 3 kids was rough, they are so well behaved and yet it was still too much. No friends, no family, no play dates, no sports, no school, just nothing but whatever I could conjure up to occupy us, besides remote learning. Just myself and the little ones day in and day out. We didn’t leave our house until September, I know this was our decision but with my husband being out and working and having an infant and child with asthma at home, we weren’t taking our chances. If it came home we knew where it came from. Long story short, I started drinking more and more. Not at an alcoholic level but habitual. I finally found a great job in the spring and love it but I work remotely with my baby and I at home all day everyday. The kids go to school now for their own mental well being and education and that’s when we get out. My depression has shifted.

No, I'm not anti-vax (got my vaccine first chance I could), turns out you can hate doctors for a multitude of reasons, but I am worried as someone with a wealth of problems with the US medical system at large. I believe this pandemic will lead into more unjust hatred for an already MASSIVELY problematic system in my country. That isn't right. I wouldn't wish a hatred and natural mistrust for a doctor on my worst enemies let alone some poor (both financially and mentally) dumb bastard who is ALREADY TAUGHT THAT DOCTORS ARE BAD FOR THEM! Because that's what you are taught as a Blue Collar or trade worker in the US, Doctors are bad people who will take your ability to work (therefore live a life) away from you, so you should just ignore how sick you feel and go to work anyway.\n\nI also think the public at large is starting to see just how skewed this system is for some.

The only symptom we had was complete loss of taste and smell. I got my taste and smell back in a couple of days but she couldn’t taste or smell anything for probably 2/3 months. \n\nAround April her smell and taste came back partially, but since then all she smells is what she describes as “rotting meat or dead bodies.” In particular, garlic and onion are huge triggers. Doesn’t matter what form it’s in or how much is used, she can’t have it or be around it. If I eat anything with garlic or onion in it, she can smell it on me hours later even after showering. Just those two ingredients alone are in quite literally everything. She can barely drink anything besides water now too. \n\nShe is in a Facebook group with thousands of other people going through the same thing. They’re always comparing symptoms and sharing the few amount of foods that don’t make them want to puke. Some people have gone back to normal but most have not. Gf has been dealing with the dead body smell for around 6 months now with no progress. There’s even some people in there who have had it for over a year, poor souls. No one has found a doctor that knows how to fix it, most of them are just told to wait it out. \n\nShe was the least picky eater I knew. She would always show me new fruits and vegetables and make me try things I’ve never even heard of. Now she rotates between like 5 meals and hasn’t been able to eat any of her favorite foods or go to her favorite restaurants. (She can’t even have chocolate ice cream anymore) \n\nIt’s one thing to have no smell at all but to have a horribly distorted smell/taste that may never change is next level.

However, the plan was to use what they call cyber knife to attack any of the nodes in his lungs that started growing. One of them started growing and they did three of these super targeted radiation treatments on the node and it didn't exactly get rid of it, but it shrunk remarkably in size and stopped growing entirely. None of the other nodes showed much in the way of growth, so the plan was to do CT scans every 2-3 months to check on growth and if any of them started growing, they would attack it with the cyber knife. \n\nAll was going well, then covid hit.\n\nHe became too afraid to leave the house and go to the hospital for the CT scans. I knew his immunity was compromised, so I was the only one that went out, and I wore masks, limited my time out, and everything was disinfected before it came into the house. His oncologist cancelled his appointments but he was free to call if he needed anything. Everything was fine at first, but by May of 2020 he started coughing. He would occasionally cough up blood, but he refused to go to the hospital or doctor. He got to the point where he would cough so hard he would gag then throw up anything he had eaten. He was getting weaker and weaker. Finally in August he was feeling so bad I finally convinced him to go to the ER. They did a CT scan and told us to contact Hospice.\n\nHe died August 25, 2020. \n\nI am sure many people with health issues did the same thing.

In terms of dark, I don't know if it gets Koch darker than these two changes: \n\n1. The number of parents who were making good progress toward reunification (I mean the ones turning their lives around in HUGE ways and truly growing [not that that excuses/erases child abuse...I'm working on my own struggles with that] but anyway) that have relinquished parental rights by CHOICE is a little heartbreaking. I've gotten so many calls from bio parents saying they lost their jobs and they know the court isn't going to be lenient so they want to give up their chance at reunification so their kids can stay is stable foater homes. (Do NOT misunderstand me, not every foster home is a fairy tale.) But it's honestly fucking heart breaking. The number of these same bio parents relapsing when they've been clean during mandated drug tests for over a year, who have been forced into shelters, lost jobs, and lost their chance at reunification in the eyes of the courts is absolutely astonishing. \n\n2. As a caseworker, I field incoming indicated DCFS (or DSS, depending on the state) calls. An indicated call means that the state child abuse/neglect hotline operator took a report and believes it may warrant an investigation. Our numbers are currently through the roof. In a city like mine, (known largely for its hot dogs and unique pizza style) this is translating to thousands of calls a week, and hundreds a day, with my independent organization alone receiving requests for investigation assistance and foster placements over 200 times a DAY. Parents who could barely handle parenthood as is can't deal with the \"strain\" of having their children home all day when they're used to have an 8 hour break from them. \n\nIt's disgusting. It's horrifying. It's fucking EXHAUSTING. And not just emotionally. I work over 20 hours unpaid overtime on top of my 50 hour work week to assist in investigations and following up on indicated reports of abuse and neglect. And that's just the reports we GET. There's no telling what we can't and/or don't see and hear. It's pushing a lot of us into burnout like never before. And all for 40k a year and not being allowed to unionize in a state with unions for everyone else, even one of the most violent and bloated police forces I the country. \n\nBefore y'all shit a chicken I want to say that I am a survivor of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse working in my field for 10 years. I've work in DV, child trafficking, state and private child welfare agencies, and grassroots political campaigns against violence against children. In my personal opinion, there is NEVER an excuse for child abuse/neglect. But if the question is what dark shit Covid has uncovered, this is it.",

We have waiting lists for every single month up until May of next year. Because we are bottom of the food chain as far as medical sales, I have to really be on top of our medical supply stock because if the hospitals need it they get first dibs (it took me 7 months to get one of our anti hemorrhage drugs). Our cost have also tripled. We are so overrun with waiting lists that they just call over and over and over crying. We have even had a couple just show up in our office and literally beg to transfer. Our clients report more anxiety, depression, abuse, lack of resources, obsessive compulsive habits, and fear. We have a really good relationship with our local hospital, but sometimes their policies change so quickly that they can’t give us a heads up of what to tell our clients if we need to utilize them. \n\nThe worst circumstance I’ve seen though: a healthy mother with a planned pregnancy and planned out of hospital birth. Pregnancy is normal. But at the 20 week anatomy ultrasound they find multiple organ anomalies and it is deemed the baby is incompatible with life. We transfer her to a specialist and they sent her back to us. Because the baby would pass within minutes of birth, they decided she would have to give birth alone to limit risk of COVID exposure to staff. So because she had a provider that would give her care already they sent her back to us so she would be able to have her husband with her during the experience. \n\nMost birth workers I know are strapped with crippling anxiety. We get calls CONSTANTLY for resources. Our usual pediatrician referrals are overwhelmed. We have no where to send moms suffering from PMADs because mental health care workers are so overwhelmed. Moms are even more isolated in the post partum. Post partum depression, anxiety and rage has sky rocketed and we have no good options most of the time for resources.

This was in 2012, and I was shocked and it was humbling and eye-opening. But now, after watching what’s been happening, especially recently as more young, healthy people are dying due to being unvaccinated, I am seeing SO MANY cases of both parents dying, all over the country (US), and leaving behind multiple children, and young ones. Just today I’ve seen accounts of three different families, with 3-4 small children under 10, who have now lost both parents, and I keep seeing more every day.\n\nThis phenomenon is no longer only limited to places that suffer from poverty or other lack of resources that causes loss of parents when children are 25 or younger.

It won’t be apparent at first, and communities may never make the connection between what’s happening and the massive loss of young parents (like 45 and under), but it will cause a huge shift in population, education, and advancement in places that have lost the most, especially long-term. I think about it all the time.",

So switch to ash which is super light grey. No stock in anything.

Now multiply those by 20 and you’ve got yourself a COVID classroom.\n\nI doubt any kids got a very good education this past year, but it’s no fault of the teacher. A lot of parents elected to take their kids out of school in favor of homeschooling, then did not enforce any work. Heck, a lot of parents didn’t enforce work in the first place which led to a lot of “incompletes” in the grade book.\n\nAnd because of the way education laws are structured (at least in the US), funding is based almost solely on standardized test scores. Guess who’s not scoring well on any standardized test? This generation. They’ve essentially lost an entire year of learning because of all the difficulties in COVID teaching.\n\nP.S.: I’m not trying to say it’s always the parents’ fault. There are fantastic parents out there with all the love in the world for their kids and that’s awesome. However, online teaching is just not as effective as in-class teaching for anyone under the age of, say, 15.

It would be like asking a baby to tell you what has being happening at home over a phone call. \n\nThe lack of educational support for SPED (special education) students \n\nThis going to be the 2nd fucking year some special needs students haven’t gone back to school. Not just the students who are immunocompromised but students who also have serious behavior problems and learning difficulties. Some of these kids are going to be going into school 2 grades behind because they can’t even sit still or hold their attention long enough to sit in front of a computer. They NEED their teachers in person. And it will be a shit show for teachers when they come back 2 years underdeveloped. They also would have to receive all of their required therapy over a computer.\n\nAlso, the lack of empathy for one another. \n\nI cannot imagine the massive amount of rage that families or individuals feel being in a room with someone wigging out about the vaccine’s harmful affects or “how stupid masks” are when their loved one just died from COVID. Especially when you’re at work. Mad. The emotions of disappointment, anger and sadness when someone you enjoyed being around become intolerable because of their lack of empathy and pride in their own beliefs. \n\nMy love goes out to all families with special needs children at home again this year.",

            "text": "Mental health—the way the pandemic effected people who were already waist-deep in recovery. People backslid; they lost support systems, access to therapy and medication. Those first few months were hell. \n\nWhen the pandemic started, I was a college junior, and I was 18 months into an intensive DBT therapy program to treat attachment disorder, derealization-depersonalization disorder, and social anxiety, all developed from long-term, childhood abuse which lasted until I was sixteen. After my parents got divorced, I spent every other weekend, from ages 14-16, at my dad’s house, where I’d spend the whole weekend locked in the basement. (Three guesses why lockdown fucked me up.) Therapy was hard. It kicked my ass. But I was getting better! For the first time in my life I was learning how to actually trust people. I was starting to transition from a Disorganized Attachment Style to an Anxious Attachment Style—which is characterize by the fear that the people you love are going to leave you. \n\nI vividly remember showing up to class, one day in mid March, and I was met by one of my friends who told me that, apparently, the school was shutting down indefinitely. All of my worst fears came true overnight. My support system dissolved entirely. Two of my closest friends moved back out of state to be with their families. My best friend cut off all physical contact with people because her mom was at-risk. Suddenly, I was completely isolated, locked inside of my apartment for the unforeseeable future. I had my first full-blown dissociative event—I lost time for three fucking days. It was like being unconscious and suddenly waking up and three days had passed. I had panic attacks. I had my first ever flashback where I really thought I was locked in a basement again. I dropped out of all my classes for the semester following a suicide attempt. \n\nI felt like I couldn’t talk to anybody because everybody was going through the same fucked up shit, what right did I have to complain? I didn’t want to be an added burden to an already impossibly stressful situation. Before the pandemic, I worked with my therapist to make plans for who I would contact if I ever got the urge to hurt or kill myself. But I didn’t have access to those people anymore. Legally, if you weren’t a part of the same household, you had to isolate. In my head, I didn’t feel like anybody would be willing to bend the law because I was having a “bad day”. Then I didn’t talk to my therapist for three weeks because she had to move sessions to online only and I felt abandoned by her. (I’ve been seeing her regularly since then. That was a lapse in judgement on my part.) I felt like the government was trading my life for somebody else’s and I didn’t have any say in the matter. Like everybody was willing to sacrifice the lives of people who had died of an overdose, or suicide, or domestic violence-turned-murder—people who might not have died if they hadn’t been literally trapped in their homes. Like all those people didn’t matter. Their lives were expendable. My life was expendable. \n\nOf course, I’m doing better now. I just changed my major and found a full time job doing something I like, and that stability (and increased physical activity) has massively helped my mental health. I know that my thought process was pretty fucked up at the beginning of the pandemic. I wasn’t seeing the whole picture. But even with that self-awareness, it still bothers me how nobody talked about people who had died BECAUSE of the lockdowns. I’m not saying that the lockdowns weren’t a net positive—I’m sure significantly more people would have died if they hadn’t happened. But people most definitely died because of the lockdowns. I almost died. And if I had died, nobody would’ve talked about it. It would’ve been swept under the rug. Even worse, it bothers me to think about what would’ve happened if I’d still been 15 and living with my dad when the lockdowns hit. What if I’d been locked in a basement for months on end with no hope of escape? Would I have killed myself? Would he have ever let me come out to eat (he didn’t during those weekends) or would I have starved to death? If I was a kid who, during the height of the COVID pandemic, had died of starvation because I’d been locked a basement, would anybody have noticed or cared? Would anybody have found me? Would anybody have told my mom? Would my dad have been punished? Would he have lied and said COVID had killed me? Or buried me in a backyard somewhere? Would anybody miss me? Or remember me when school started again? Or would it have been swept under the rug because it was the first few months of COVID and nobody really talks about those months? Are there kids who died of starvation, locked in somebody’s basement, that we still don’t talk about, that we forgot about, that we lost track of because it was the beginning of COVID and “everything was a mess”?",

The reality is not pleasant to think about, because all of us WANT that peaceful resolution real bad. Truth is, too many things have been altered either very long term or permanently.\n\n- Countless loved ones have very suddenly died within the span of two years (so far). Fathers, mothers, grandparents, siblings, best friends, all suddenly gone.\n\n- The political divide, especially in the US, is not going to heal soon after the end of the pandemic. Politics have gotten way more extreme and they're going to be like that for a long time.\n\n- The pandemic has so far, to put it lightly, done a huge number on a lot of people financially. That takes a long time to recover from, and there are lots of people who will succumb to poverty.\n\n- A lot of our society's systems and infrastructure have been exposed for just how fragile they are.\n\n- One of the most devastating effects of this pandemic has been the mental health crisis it is creating. Depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, etc. have all basically skyrocketed. Crushing loneliness is rampant. Kids and teens who are growing up in this environment will be majorly and/or permanently scarred by this.\n\n- COVID is likely to become at least somewhat endemic. We will have to get booster shots for the foreseeable future, like you get your flu shots.\n\nAnd those are just some of the most major points. Will we eventually get COVID under control? Probably, yeah. It will likely take a while longer but we will come out of it.\n\nWe'll be able to see our family and friends again. We'll be able to go to Disneyland and concerts and what have you. But as much as we'd like to believe they will, things are not just gonna \"go back to normal.\" \n\nIt's a very depressing truth.",

I recall a time when some hospitals allowed no visitors...some nurses/doctors tried to coordinate FaceTime calls for urgent situations. \n\nAlso, when someone dies, they can only have one visitor say goodbye to their body. No one else can come in. \n\nIt is horrifically sad and hard for everyone...patients/families/healthcare workers. The way Americans handle grief is already broken...and lack of access to our dying or dead family/friends (or lack of family support) will cause more mental health problems down the line. The amount of pressure on healthcare workers to not only be healers but also provide additional emotional support since family is unavailable is just beyond.

Trying to reduce contact and interaction between people has led to a very wasteful culture. I see masks in the gutters and parking lots all the time. There are so many rubber gloves being used and tossed out. Think of all the billions of extra medical supplies that have been used in our attempts to combat the virus. Of course there is the medical fields, that are burning through supplies, but every industry has made strange purchases, like thermometers and plastic shielding, that will be junk when this is over. And the culture of ordering everything online has become accelerated as we were discouraged from going out, instead of trucks bringing shipments to a central location, most companies have accepted that if they wanted to stay competitive at a time when people were staying home, they had to fully commit to shipping packages directly to your door and the consumers embraced it. No one thinks twice about ordering anything online. Think of all the packaging and fuel that goes into that little $10 item that gets conveniently shipped directly to someone’s door. I know we were headed there before the pandemic, but the lockdowns accelerated it’s adoption. I saw a huge increase of neighbors ordering shipments of basic supplies, like laundry soap or groceries, instead of including it in their usual market trip and that increase hasn’t dropped back to pre lockdown levels. I don't think that mentality is going away now, even when things normalize after the virus, I think that behavior will have been normalized. Supposedly a bunch of people say they hardly ever leave the house now, but I just don’t see it. The roads are just as congested as ever, and everywhere I go the lines are back to normal. The only lines that seemed to have changed are restaurants, where more people order for pickup, so the lines are noticeably shorter. Which just means meals are not being served on washable plates and utensils, instead they are boxed and bagged up, with trashable plastic utensils. Lately people have been talking a lot about needing to do something about climate change, but seem oblivious that this last year has probably been one of the most wasteful in human history. There have been supply chain shortages in all sorts of industries and products, but I don’t think that is because we are producing less due to people being sick, it’s that everywhere has been consuming more to meet the demands of a disposable, delivery, everything online world.",

Throw whatever else you want in there. I'm sure we're getting fucked over by it somehow. \n\nTo provide a simple anecdote, I'm an EMT in a county of roughly 275k people. We have two hospitals with emergency departments.

So we count the docs in each facility and I believe there was only one on in each ED. That's 21 people to tend to the emergencies of a county of 275k people. This gets worse when you consider that each 911 call that results in transport to the ED requires 2 of us prehospital personnel to transport + a physician to assess at the ED + a nurse to take over care from us. \n\nIt's getting bad. Many nights, when we aren't running a call, we're waiting for a bed with a patient on our gurney. As soon as we turn over care and get our rig back together, we're running another call.

My room was right next to the nurses station.\n\nA few weeks ago I was hospitalized with a broken femur. I was in the ER for almost two days before I finally got moved to surgery late afternoon. It was about 10pm the second day when I finally got moved to a room after surgery. Admin tried to discharge me the next morning (right after the Physical Therapist came to see me) to open a bed for someone else, I said I wasn't ready. My nurses agreed with me and were pissed that the hospital tried to kick me out so soon. I still heard nothing about the surgery, biopsies, and blood tests (my post-op nurses didn't know anything either). I did stay one more day, on which I finally got told the results from everything before I was released.\n\nI'm not upset about since I understand that they were very short staffed, but it wasn't fun waking up from surgery to my phone blowing up with family wondering what's going on (I'm 1000 miles away from everyone, and nobody called my contact with a surgery update). I was intubated while under so it was hard to speak. And being in excruciating pain and having to wait an hour or more after the meds wore off and nobody came (even after pushing the help button twice and the guy I shared a room with heard me and also called for help). That nurse gave me a way to call her pager directly.\n\nAll of my nurses liked having me as their patient. I even heard a few of them saying how \"sweet\" and good I was during shift changes. I just cooperated, and was quiet and polite the whole time.",

The darkest outcome, however, is that a portion of the world has highly subsidized the positive or logical actions of regressive individuals (mask mandates by region having a strong correlation with political demographics, etc.)  The altruism of that bloc of people will always bail out those who set progress backwards. Therefore: life, industry, education, etc is less efficient and less stable than in regressive areas, and ultimately it has become far harder and more precarious for those attempting to follow science and to strive for ideals than it is for those who purely exhibit self interest and who will never return the favor. It’s simply reduced resources, stamina, and credibility of progressive efforts when rules are so easily ignored with no consequences save death- cognitive dissonance can easily hide the correlation to COVID from a regressive thinker. \n\nSo today’s children go to school and learn things that are openly dismissed by politicians and social influencers and watch rules established by leaders basing their decisions on science and data ignored with no actual consequence- medical resources shared, platforms in the media maintained, and power and influence aplenty. Does nihilism set in and cause the future to decide that utilitarianism is dead or persuade them to abandon policy and education as means of progress?

Check on your vets, vet techs and vet staff. We are not ok! \n\nAlso advice to pet owners. Take proper care of your pet! Call at the FIRST sign of illness, even if this means you might have to cancel the appointment later because trust me we'll fill it. And be prepared for long ER wait times. Don't sit on an issue for a couple hours and then go to the ER. Get yourself in line at the ER and then think about if you need to be there or not. It's a scary time for animals, be on top of things! I also recommend getting set up as a client with a regular vet if you dont have one. Clinics will squeeze in their own clients before non clients. \n\nAnd finally, please have some compassion for the people trying to HELP your animals.

I am not talking only about the constant impression that one may be infected with Covid and the continuous overanalyzing of potential symptoms that may indicate Covid. \n\nI am talking about the hyper-awareness that many of us have developed (especially young people) to the possibility of becoming sick and dying at a young age. While maintaining better hygiene and avoiding behaviours that jeopardize health (ex: smoking, eating unhealthy food, not exercising etc) is highly beneficial and it is very good that young people have developed more awareness in that department, there is no denying that there is a fine line between being proactive and being paranoid, a line which many of us have crossed. \n\nThe way I see it, this is the result of a combination of factors.\n\nFirst of all, the lack of access to medical services with the same ease we were used to. The idea of being denied the possibility to go to the doctor at any point you see fit. \n\nSecond, the infinite exposure to content about the pandemic.\n\n\nThird, the increasing distrust and unreliability revolving around the medical services. Vaccines are getting a bad rap more than ever, all sorts of treatments were praised and then quickly vilified, transparency left a lot to be desired etc.\n\n\nTherefore, the perfect recipe for prolonged hypochondria is there. The worst part is that the effects are long term and many young people may not be yet aware that their brain has self-wired to obsess over the possibility of being sick and dying at a young age. The effects are typically noticeable after a given time period, once the 'survival instinct' and  coping mechanisms are no longer at the peak. (So far, we have all focused on adapting to the new 'normal'). Trauma like this settles in slowly and kicks in when you least expect it. \n\n\nI personally have experienced a similar phenomenon very early in life after losing a friend to a late-detected cancer. The scars on me and the other schoolmates were deep and we only realised that we have lived with unfounded fear of being 'next in line' when we were old enough to perform self-analysis. \n\n\n\nI am not saying all young people suffer from this or will become hypochondriac as a result of the pandemic. But it is definitely a by-product that few seem to take into consideration.\n\n\n\nP.S. I apologize in advance if the text is phrased in a rather twisted way, English is my second language.",

Prisons aren't built for social distancing, so medium and minimum security prisoners, who usually would be able to be out and about and active are spending more time in cells with less stimulation. Enrichment, education, and rehabilitation programs are reduced or canceled. Meals normally served as hot meals Ina dining hall have become brown bag lunches served at cell doors. Visitation from friends and family is reduced or canceled. It takes more advance planning and effort than usual to communicate with attorneys, courts, case workers, and other professionals. Visits from clergy or prisoner advocates are reduced or canceled.\n\nThere are inevitably some people reading this saying, \"Who cares? They committed a crime!\" One of the cornerstones of the American way of life is civil rights. You don't lose all of your civil rights just because you were convicted of a crime. These people were sentenced to prison. They weren't sentenced to isolation from family, from legal services, or restriction from all rehabilitation resources. It's not simply a matter of throwing someone in prison and saying that whatever happens to them there is what they deserve. \n\nThe way we treat the least likable, most vulnerable people in our society reveals who we really are.",

Additionally, a lot of people weren't able to access medications they needed because they were compromised and couldn't leave their buildings. I remember in particular an older gentleman who had HIV that had progressed to AIDS because he wasn't able to get his medication to fight it off for a month. We also had to follow new protocols for awhile that restricted the number of people we could do CPR on. We were to place the defibrillator pads on, and if it said that the patient's heart couldn't be shocked because it wasn't in a particular set of rythms (V-Fib or V-Tach), we were to stop and call for termination (to pronounce them on scene, usually in their home). If you're not in one of those two heart rythms, the chances of coming back are pretty slim, but not none. What we did before and what we went back to doing is 20 minutes before calling it. I can't vouch for this personally, but I've had colleagues who had said that they'd seen an uptick in domestic abuse and violence, but thankfully I hadn't seen that increase. What I have seen is a worse attitude in general in regards to patient care. \n\nEdit: more stuff \n\nPTSD in providers was always an issue, but it's a bigger one now just because of the volume of sick and dying people.

I also worked in a kindergarten for a highschool credit during covid and not being able to hold the kids hands or give them hugs when they hurt themselves or were just having a bad day just tore my heart apart (I and some of the other teachers broke this rule a few times) and not just me but other teachers thought the lack of emotional support through touching the kids are getting could to lead to very bad issues later on. \n\nOn a positive note during this time I lost 70 pounds.

But when the time for the wedding came, during the summer of 2020, it was in another state. I was doing I job I couldn't do from home (Walmart cashier), and if I traveled, I would have to be quarantined for two weeks after getting home. Plus, due to my store's location to a retirement town, many of our customers were on the older end, or those most at risk.\n\nEvery precaution was taken, but this was before the vaccines were available, some people have Covid with no symptoms, and it can last longer than two weeks.

He said that before the pandemic it would be almost unheard of to meet an 18-month child who had never interacted with another baby before, but that parents had been being (understandably) protective of their little ones. My mum also said she wondered whether some kids would sense their parent’s fear when they were out and about and an unmasked person got too close, and how that would affect the child’s outlook.

As many countries have rules that certain low hour jobs don't qualify for unemployment or because many students are already at poverty level incomes, this hit *hard*. And there were just no help from any programs, whereas many other in that situation could at least turn to some kind of special help program. At least where I come from university students are also not qualifying for social benefits.\n\nMany had to move out and back to their parents, delaying important developments.\n\nUniversities were **absolutely clueless**. This was especially bad in countries were exams fall into late spring or falls because those were high tide times. Exams people need to study for for weeks were delayed without further notice, cancelled or held under extremely different and irritating conditions.\nCourses had to suddenly switch to online learning but were expected to still get through at fill capacity, albeit many professors didn't provide good working material.\n\nLearning was made a lot more difficult. Working groups couldn't form for beginners. For others they couldn't meet. Libraries remained closed forever, lunch places closer or only offered takeout, worsening not only study options but also nutrition. Many walk-in hours were cancelled. Exercises suddenly switched to online, were tutors couldn't ask the puzzled looking students if they needed help or were completely moved to \"do this at home\". \n\nThe mental distress was *enormous*. Isolation was horrible, many remote workers at least still had remote meetings. Students suddenly didn't. Additionally, isolating in a teeny-tiny flat with basically no money to pay for a new hobby was the situation for many. As mentioned: everything concerning studying for harder, but loads didn't sink leading to enormous pressure. This was only worsened by economical threats from students own jobs or cutback at their parents job. Social development further stalled for many who had to move back in with parents. Additionally, manz of my acquaintances suffered a lot because politics just didn't care **at all** to look even once into that direction. It took nearly a full semester to remove the first covid semester from possible punishments for not finishing in the regular time, which was an absolute necessity to not create a clusterf.. of problems just two months later.\n\nThere will be so many drop outs and delays in the coming years, due to economic problems, because keeping up the load just wasn't possible and because new students never learned how to learn and help each other which is necessary in later classes.\n\nAdditionally, the whole younger generation got a lot of grief for partying or disregarding rules, at the same time no one seemed to care that they were seriously suffering. Especially concerning that it is e.g. much harder to follow the rules when nearly anyone but you can go to school or work or see people in remote meetings, while your interaction is reduced to watching videos on your own in a depressingly tiny place to live.\n\nI know many of those also apply to many other parts of population, but those at least got some attention from media and politics.",

Since catching Covid I had to worry all the time that I ironically might be the thing that killed him. Now I’m done in isolation and I don’t have the same mental feeling anymore, it’s hard to say but things don’t matter to me as much now. I still care about my grandfather and want to take care of him. But now I took extreme precaution, wore a mask everywhere, didn’t go out besides shopping. Serialized shopping carts and sanitized and I still caught it. It feels like all the mental stress broke something in my brain.. but at the same time it’s almost freeing. Things don’t bother like they use to. I grew up in New England and the “New England Rage” only simple things is starting to fade. I enjoy aspect of recovery but still I don’t like how hollow I feel. I wouldn’t change what I did for the last year-plus. But damn.. it’s been discouraging.\n\nAlso beyond that, I’ve had extreme fatigue. Cutting up vegetables is. Ow a chore and I find myself needing to lay down after prepping food and cleaning up or cooking or cleaning the house.\n\nAlso my tinnitus has gotten worse. I’ve had to except the fact I won’t be able to ever hear silence again. Always a low sharp ringing that’s only grown since testing positive. \n\nOn the plus side though I’m learning to slow things down in life. My new lack of carings about things let’s me appreciate every important detail of my life. I’m spending time with my family. I’ve become a better home cook, if only to give my grandfather something to look forward in the day. Hell I can’t believe I’m saying this, but catching Covid has made me a better person and I appreciate the right things more. It’s made me want to take better care of myself. I’ve been going in Omegle at night telling jokes and stories and I Ben got payed a couple of times for entertaining people.\n\nCovid has created a new high in my life and how reassure me I’m funny and can make people, total strangers laugh. It’s given me confidence in myself that nu family isn’t laughing at my jokes just because their related to me. There’s been a lot of downsides to Covid but it’s made me a “glass half full” type of guy",

And I try to tell them stories or share the negative effects and everything that's happening 'out there' but we're in our own bubble here and it can't possibly affect us...I feel like I'm wasting my breath and driving people away. There is no real support for the vaccine here except from medical personnel and it's incredibly depressing to know that after all this time, we have some way to combat Covid but nobody gives a damn.",

It’s sort of obvious we were way too restrictive about closing schools and were more than willing to mortgage the development of children for the fears of adults. \n\nI also think the borderline genocidal language aimed at the unvaccinated folks has been inappropriate.

Ive seen insurances deny or delay approval for essential specialist appointments due to overwhelm and staffing shortages. Long wait times for a pt to get into a specialist or having to find a patient a new one because a specialist left, retired or is overbooked up to a year ahead of time.  I’ve seen patients ask for prior auths on things like Tylenol, Zyrtec or other available otc medications because an rx is more affordable than otc for the same medication.. or because none is available due to supply shortages and other hard bearings on families like accessibly or affordability for known or unknown reasons.",
