His theory was followed by a deluge of terrible, dangerous, and vicious pseudo-science that generally boiled down, one way or another, to \"People who don't look / think / act like me are less evolved savages whom I don't need to treat like real people.\" If you look back at \"thinkers\" like Lombroso or Nordau, you can trace the lines from Darwin straight through to the eugenics movement, and racists and imperialists everywhere were quick to cry \"evolution\" when they meant \"We want those people's lands / money / lives / labor.\"\n\nIt's particularly creepy in a book like Max Nordau's \"Degeneration.\" As he explains blandly that the victims of degeneration will argue that they aren't degenerate, but no one needs to listen to their explanations because they're just symptoms of their dangerously diseased brains, you can practically hear the Nazi jackboots marching in the background - and the man is Jewish! He's using the line of logic that in 50 years will result in the Holocaust.\n\nThen, of course, there's Social Darwinism, which at its worst and most self-serving turned into \"If you're poor and dying, that's a needed culling that will make our economy and society stronger.\" Darwin, to be clear, didn't create these offshoots of his theory, and of course humans have been finding ways to decide that other people don't count as people for as long as we've had humans. However, Darwin's ideas were quickly seized and used as the implicit or explicit underpinning of over a century of justifications for every kind of exploitation and bloodshed.\n\nETA: Since it's getting repetitious to reply to individual comments, please note that I'm not denying the accuracy of Darwin's theory (he was clearly right, at least in the broad strokes), attacking his intentions (see sentence 1, \"unintentional\"), or holding him personally responsible for the damage (see second to last sentence). This is a post about the power of ideas and their uncontrollable and often unforseen consequences, not an attack on the theory of evolution.",

Obviously conmen like Joseph Smith and L. Ron Hubbard come to mind. But a less politically correct candidate for this shameful distinction is the prophet Muhammad. It is literally the opposite of racism to name the founder of Islam as a negative influence on humanity given that you are making the case that genetics have nothing to do with radical Muslim behavior and that all such behavior is learned. But people are quick to call you a racist when you point out the deleterious effect Islam has had on the world. Christianity has had a similarly deleterious effect but you are free to criticize it, possibly because many of the adherents are white skinned westerners. Anyway, Muhammad was a pretty terrible person. He conquered as much of the middle east as he could and it seems logical to infer he would have conquered longer and farther had he lived another decade or so.",

Trump didn't cause COVID-19, but he is directly and 100% culpable for all of the idiots across the entire world trying to pretend it's not a thing. If there was no Trump, this would have still happened, but nobody would have thought twice about taking a vaccine or masking up. Thus, he's directly responsible for severely debilitating the entire world economy.\n\nThe real key for why I think this is the most damaging thing any single person is responsible for in history is because it happened *today*. For most of human history, we didn't actually advance all that much. Pick any random human over the course of history and their life was likely damn near identical to their great grandparents' lives.\n\nThat changed with the industrial revolution. Ever since, we haven't simply been progressing quickly, the *rate* of progress has been growing as well.\n\nIn essence, the modern progression of humanity is similar to compound interest. Let's say you've got $100. If you invest it in an account that gives 10% today, that means in 5 years you've got $161 and in 10 years you've got $259.\n\nIf, instead, you wait and start investing *next* year, then 5 years from today you'd have $146 and in 10 years you'd have $235.\n\nSo from skipping one year of interest, you're $15 poorer in 5 years and $24 poorer in 10 years. And that deficit is just going to keep getting larger and larger over time.\n\nAnd thus, because of the setbacks of COVID-19, the gulf between where humanity *is* and where we *should have been* is going to just keep getting wider and wider as time goes on.",

As long as the CCP remain in power those innovations never will come either. The society and education system which has been engineered to control the people and keep the party in power strips the people of any desire, or incentive, to create, innovate, think critically, or question their human condition, as religion and spirituality has also been trampled on along with freedom of thought and free expression.\n\nWe cope with it because it is hard to conceptualize this loss, as we haven't technically \"lost\" anything. Rather, we, as a species, have been denied the benefits of having 1.4 billion more free-thinking, critical, questioning, exploring souls inhabiting the world. Instead, we have parrots and sheep whose only advancements come through stealing others' work.\n\nI don't even like to try to seriously imagine how much more advanced as a species in all areas, moral, spiritual, and technological, we would be if the Chinese had not been turned into what they are now, as it just makes me sad when I do.",

At their own expense. \n\nMaybe you could argue competiting products weren't much better and would still require support or Windows was the least bad out of a lot of poor products. \n\nBut there were so many good companies that Microsoft brought, made worse, and killed off. \n\nDoes anyone remember FolderShare? It was an excellent p2p file synchronisation tool. Worked brilliantly. Skype? It was the most popular voice and video chat program for a while. Internet Explorer? Microsoft broke standards to try to force people to use it, and thus Windows, for no other reason than money. How about video codecs? In the early days of web video Microsoft released a bunch of video tools for free to try to get people hooked on their own codecs - and thus - Windows - and (happily) they fucked that up too. Can you imagine a world where you HAD to use Windows to use Netflix or Youtube?\n\nHow about Windows Vista? It was so slow it required a fast computer to run. Then Netbooks came out which Microsoft didn't anticipate so in a panic they made Windows 7 - which was actually fairly fast - proving Microsoft COULD release an optimised version of Windows - they just didn't fucking want to. \n\nBill Gates is to the world of computers what the Catholic church was to science. Reign it in at all costs to maintain power and control at the expense of the progress of the human race.\n\nFuck that guy.",

One thing that kept happening was a lot of women and girls revealed that they had been sexually abused in their childhoods by male family members (mostly their own fathers). Freud didn’t want to upset Europe’s wealthy families by revealing this as he would essentially be telling the world that these wealthy men were molesting their own daughters. He didn’t want to lose their support after all. So he covered it up by claiming these women and girls had not been abused, but their “beliefs of these occurrences” were the result of fantasy and desire for their own fathers. He also threw in some good old labelling of “hysteria” to ensure that no one took these victims seriously.\n\nHe basically could have brought incestual abuse to the forefront (***holes who were doing the abusing could have been punished) and actually helped victims of such abuse. But he didn’t want to piss off the wealthy people who thought he was cool. \n\nI believe the way sexual abuse was handled could have advanced so much quicker, had he used his access to willing patients properly instead of covering it up.",

Not because he ruled the most powerful military in modern history with thousands of nukes at his fingertips and had no idea how to operate them for 4 years, but because he’s created a dangerous political atmosphere in the US. Thanks to Trump, the bipartisan split is now larger and more extreme then ever, about half the country has fallen to his racist, sexist, homophobic ideologies and ideals, and now he’s set the precedent that any fool can become President of the United States.\n\nWhat Trump has done has literally broken the USA, the most powerful country in the modern world, in half. Abraham Lincoln said it to the same Republican Party Trump now leads: ‘A house divided among itself cannot stand.’ When half the country becomes violent gun-toting pseudo-terrorists, and the other half can’t talk any sense into them because they refuse to listen, there is going to be a second civil war. January 6 riots, every day, for months or possibly years. And not soldiers fighting on battlefields, civilians fighting in the street. The US is going to dissolve from the inside if the current political atmosphere continues, and if that’s the case the whole world should be scared of what happens if the terrorist half gets to the big red button.",

Using up the vast political capital he had by saving the Allies in WW1 to create a global political body that was useless and his own government didn't support. Whenever he could have pushed back on something that was clearly a bad idea, like for example, the partition of the Ottoman Middle East or painful reparations upon Germany, all the other Allied leaders had to do was threaten his League of Nations and he caved like a little bitch.\n\n2. Enshrined and reinforced Jim Crow and segregation laws moreso than any other US President. I don't think I have to go into how that's still affecting us. \n\n3. Pushed heavily for Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, and failed to commit anything of substance that could actually turn the tide, instead just sending in a tiny invasion that was just enough to forever engrain the thought in Russia that the US was an enemy.

Ironically, this throw-off line by Herodotus is what scholars now believe is evidence that the Egyptians actually did sail around the Cape of Good Hope and round Africa.

The border skirmishes that led to to Urban's call were political between governments, not religious at all. Spain could have been retaken by the Spanish without wiping out all non-christians. But Urban's introduction of violence as a path into heaven set a dark path for European history, and the suppression of ideas that clashed with the church. The inquisition purged Spain and France of non-christian works and anyone who was not catholic, and the Teutonic league did the same in Germany. This directly led to the creation of missions in French and Spanish america, and the suppression of native american culture all the way up to Canadian residential schools. Math was specifically seen as a sort of magic, and was heavily monitored by the inquisition. Bizarre but true.",

Slavery was on the decline and with more people turning to doing their own work Whitney thought this would reduce the work load. Unfortunately, it industrialized the cotton farms and slavery became the driving power for these plantations to be early versions of southern factories.\n\nWhat’s worse is Eli did not really make money on this, the idea was stolen from him. So how did he make his money you ask? Industry standard gun parts. Whitney was the first man to say that if you’re going to make guns, let’s all make the same parts. Up until this point if you had a gun, you had to go to that gun’s maker for repairs. Not any more. Now we can mass produce them and have them fixed easily. \n\nKnow those slaves we mentioned in the last paragraph? Yeah, some northerners don’t like that and since the south isn’t complying with their desires the politicians are blasting to the north that southerners are uneducated and are going to kill to keep slaves. As a result the south is stockpiling arms.\n\nThere seems to be a cycle here.\n\nWell would you look at that, perfect time for a civil war.\n\n…\n\nThe war is done, time to move completely to a two party system and encourage carpet bagging. \n\nCall it a stretch all you want, Eli Whitney snowballed is into the post civil war political climate and America still feels it.\n\nTLDR: I blame Eli Whitney for most of my problems",

Climate being so nebulous, we'll never know down the road which extinct species might merely have remained endangered, or how many meters of sea level rise could have been avoided, had he not taken office.

Pol Pot gave no fucks and left no exceptions. He killed anyone who was intellectual (this included people who wore glasses, simply because they looked smart), women, children and babies. His party burned libraries, forced people into slave labour and kept them in concentration camps. Between 1975 - 79 they killed near 2 million people. They would’ve for sure kept on going had they not been stopped. \n\nOne of Pol Pot’s main reasonings behind all this was because he wanted to revert Cambodia back to a self-sufficient way of living, where money had no influence in their society and people lived in rural areas as opposed to cities / urban area. A “fresh start” for humanity - consequentially halting its progression. \n\nThis man…. what this guy did is still being felt 40 years on in Cambodia today, and a lot of people say will continue to be felt for future decades, possibly even centuries. To top it all off, it was only in 1997 that he faced trial - in which he was sentenced to…… wait for it…… house arrest. \n\nHe died about less than a year after his sentencing, which would’ve left so many people in Cambodia without closure.\n\nOne of the worst effects I heard from this was that less than 10% of Cambodia’s population today have made it to over 50 years old. While more than 50% of their population are under 24. This would mean that there won’t be many alive today that will remember much first-hand about the genocide and its effects on Cambodia. \n\nSurely this is damaging to humanity’s progression at its finest.",

The USSR partitioning Poland with Nazi Germany was one of the causes of WW2 and ultimately led to tens of millions of deaths.\n\nIn much of the developing world, Marxists toppled or attacked governments, often with support from the Communist bloc. This in turn led to the ascension of far right anti-communist reactionaries in many regions, which also negatively impacted economies.\n\nMarxism, being based on 19th century antisemitic conspiracy theories ( see Marx's 1843 screed, \"On the Jewish Question\", and the 1856 \"The Russian Loan\") also served as an axis of spreading said conspiracy theories due to the large number of Jewish bankers and financiers. Countries like the USSR promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories, and Russia likely was in part vulnerable to Marxism because of its history of antisemitism. This in turn was likely a contributing factor for the Holocaust and continued persecution of Jewish people.\n\nSo much awful stuff.\n\nAnd because of the acceleration of progress in the 19th and 20th centuries, this almost certainly had a larger impact than more distant historical figures.",

He started the Mongolian empire and killed so many people he actually depopulated Central Asia for centuries, and his successors did something similar, not that his actions were not justifiable, but it certainly set the civilization in Central Asia and large swarth of Asia by a considerable degree.

Destroying that route ended China’s age of foreign acceptance and slowly made them proud and ignorant of the outside world",

And we continued where we left off with this research over the last 10+ years and learned that psychedelics treat anxiety, depression, ptsd, alcoholism and other addictions.

And most importantly, in psychology psychedelics were tools for mapping out the consciousness and understanding this great mystery. In other words psychedelics in psychology are like a microscope to a chemist.",

No one person walked into the libraries at Alexandria and murdered the scribes and thinkers there. No one person burned those libraries. No one person ever achieved totalitarianism on the merits of their own actions, the blood on their own hands. \n\n Every one of the darkest deeds of ignorance and jealousy on a national or international level, ever enacted, was enacted by GROUPS of people. Those giving the orders aside, it takes legions to enforce an idiocracy, it takes armies to police a state and keep it stagnant in thought, blind to the future. These things are not the acts of one person, although their edicts may set things in motion. Theirs are not the hands that held the swords, the torches, the guns, the joysticks, that did and do the work of evil. They are only the ones who spoke the words. For their orders to become manifest, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, in some cases millions, had to comply. Compliance, regardless of training, is a choice, it is and always has been a choice, even in the darkest ages of mankind. \n\n Yes, those individuals, the ones who did the murdering, the ones who did the burning, everyone above them in command, every person in the chain of responsibility, all of them bear the mark of the damnation they forced upon the future, none are innocent. No one person has ever had the power to unilaterally demolish progress, without the consent of legions and legions of people who should have, and often did know better, being unwilling to stick their necks out and simply refuse to do that which must not be done, to strike the heads from those who sought to destroy the future. \n\n Every soldier who ever committed, or stood by and watched as war crimes were enacted, every person who even so much as wrote a document to assist in even the slightest way, the Nazi party, every person who didn't stand up and fight against the empire builders, those who wished to delete knowledge from the world in all human history, is responsible, no one person, no matter how twisted, more than any other. \n\n The sin is not retained by the one giving orders, but by all who carry them out, no matter what excuses they might have had, no matter the threat to them if they refused. Human beings have known better than to do these things for a lot longer than we give them credit for, and every one of them knew the wrong they were doing as it was done, or were too monstrous to restrain themselves. \n\n Even in recent history, there were those in big oil who knew the damage their products and procedures caused the Earth, knew for scientific fact that their business could not exist alongside a healthy climate that would support the population for a great deal of time, and they chose to go ahead and continue their work regardless, not to keep their employees solvent, but to keep themselves and their cohort in the big money, and for no other reason. But their evil could never have been effective in putting us beyond the point of no return, without the wilful ignorance and contempt of tens of thousands of willing people, ready to turn the nuts and bolts of the machinery that kept the oil flowing, regardless of what it did to the landscape, to the air, to the water, to the plants, animals and the people of the world. \n\n No one who does in either ignorance or wilful disregard, what is CLEARLY wrong, gets a pass, whether they order something or are the ones enacting it. They are a whole, a dark and dismal whole, to be vilified for all time, regardless of their bleating about chain of command.",

In addition to the obvious damage to the planet and deaths caused by these substances TEL has had a much more sinister and lingering effect.  Lead, as you may know, has a terrible effect on the brain.  It has been shown to make people more susceptible to a wide array of mental health problems such as addiction, anxiety, and of particular note antisocial personality disorder or sociopathy.  In general being exposed to high levels of lead especially when young can diminish your empathy.  So any children being raised say between 1924 and 1976( and even later really as it wasn’t discontinued all at once) would probably show a general lack of empathy compared to others not raised in times of leaded gasoline.  Basically baby boomers and the early gen x crowd.  This is why America went from implementing progressive social programs like social security and Medicaid to…well what it is now.  Leaded gasoline was responsible for over a million deaths annually but also the deaths and turmoil caused by the ruthless practices of the US government of the last half century can be linked to a voter base that just didn’t care about anything or anyone else as long as they were getting theirs.

W. Bush. The idea of man made climate change was just catching on and the US was pushing the world to sign a far more aggressive climate treaty than the current Paris Accords. This was in like 1991.\n\nAt this point the anti-climate change folks were arguing that it may not be as bad or happen as quickly as we think, and it may not be entirely humanity's fault, and whatever we do we should try not to wreck the economy while fixing the climate. It was literally unheard of it deny climate change outright.\n\nSununu, who fancied himself a computational modeler (even though the finite element analysis / modeling he did in engineering is nothing at all like climate modeling) decided he was smarter than the teams of NASA climatologists who were telling Bush about the dangers of climate change. He had personal beef with one of the lead scientists too, and his ego couldn't let it go.\n\nHe convinced Bush Sr. that it was all bullshit and got the US to pull out of the treaty, dooming it to fail. He then wrote an op-ed about how NASA are just crackpots and doomsayers, and insisted the entire thing is a hoax to get grant money.\n\nThat was the first time in history anyone with any serious \"scientific\" credibility denied climate change was not real. I honestly think the opponents didn't even consider blanket denial until Sununu came forward. It changed the landscape overnight and within a month dozens or [fossil fuel funded] scientists, and strangely enough, meteorologists had come forward agreeing. Thus was born the whole \"*it's not real, it's a hoax*\" movement we're still battling today. \n\nI sincerely think in the long run he'll have been indirectly responsible for a billion deaths. I hope history remembers him accordingly. \n\nThink of how much further ahead humanity would be if we started taking serious action 30 years ago. We lost that chance, all because one cocky engineer thought he was smarter than everyone else, couldn't stay in his lane, and would risk the entire world to satisfy his ego.

Or maybe it was whoever invented the bullet to replace musket balls.  A case could be made that maybe it was President Harry Truman, when he reneged on post WWII policy assurances made to Stalin by FDR, thus prompting Russia into overthrowing democracy in Poland and more, all as part of creating a soviet controlled \"iron wall\" between Russia and the rest of Europe, leading to the cold war and isolation of the west from the east.  And maybe top that decision off with U.S. decisions in the Truman years to not back the very corrupt KMT in mainland China, thus leading to the even worse situation of having the communists winning China's civil war and taking control of China instead.  Or maybe it was whoever led the Republican movement in Congress to oppose the creation of the League of Nations, as envisioned by Woodrow Wilson, which very well might have averted there ever being a WWII just a couple of decades after \"The War to End All Wars\": \"The Great War,\" which now we call World War One.  Or maybe it was Moses, because he invented a religion that would eventually lead to three religions, Jewish, Christian and Islam, the latter two of which have all sorts of history of creating wars and supporting or installing all sorts of highly religious yet human-rights suppressing governments, from well before the days of the Spanish Inquisition, the three crusades, all the way up to today's international terrorist situation and various ruthlessly oppressive authoritarian Islamic governments around the world.  Or maybe it was Stalin for initiating the Space Race, because heaven knows just how much rocket fuel we have burned, just how much CO2 and pollution all this space stuff has created since the first space race rocket launches in the late 1950s.  Every launch is as good as a record California wildfire in the air with millions of gallons just burned off, lots of CO2 and other pollutants exhausted unfiltered, all contributing to global warming.  Or maybe it was the guy who invented \"How to start a fire without fire\" in the first place, which led to this whole global warming mess we are now in.  As if teaching people how to makes fires and explosions and global warming was ever going to lead to a whole lot of good!  Damn that caveman or cavewoman, whoever it was who invented fire starting!",

When the women (about 5 depending on the sources) and children were INITIALLY spared, >!Freydis complained!<. When the party was still reeling from indecision (of brutally murdering women and children, as it was FROWNED UPON, and ILLEGAL under known rules and authority by tradition of Viking/Norse life - women AND SPECIALLY CHILDREN that were freemen/women - were seen as resources that were ill-afford to lose, specially when creating a new settlement, colony).\n\n>!Freydis took upon herself, with an axe, and proceeded to murder all the remaining parties, at cold blood.!<\n\nWhen Leif finds out, he has limited options. He can't kill her, without repercussion, being his sibling (and a notable female in some circles, depending on resources). Leif was also a chieftain, (king in some circles/interpretations) and by casting judgement on his sibling/fellow colonizer, he'd be letting the crime to light, and cause havoc to his own claims in Greenland.\n\nWe must remember. Viking/Norse life, while very unified by strict codes, religion, and family values, THIS WAS TRIBAL at certain, best, of times.   \nA Norse would go to war/explore/do business, usually with members of the family, local ''neighborhood'', or clan-village-town next door.  \nThis may be a trait of island culture/traditions but must be explored/discussed/argued before making assumptions out-of-the-ass.   \nAnd, Norse by nature - due to life in the frigids, were highly opportunistic.   \nViking - raider - pirate - he who sails - the definition varies depending on the country / clan of origin and the function which served for the one who ''did the trip''.\n\nHistory tells us he (Leif) chose to ''wrap things up'', called the colony back to Greenland, thus being abandoned, and Vikings, who discovered Canada / North America in the gist of 5 CENTURIES (500 plus minus years) before Europeans, would have changed multiple scales.\n\nThe North War between Norway, Denmark, and Sweden.   \nThe Ascension War of Cnut, which could have changed the actual ascension of below;   \nThe Expansion of Power by Cnut, causing the North Sea Empire (WHICH WOULD HAVE INCLUDED NEWFOUNDLAND TERRITORY).The assimilation of Natives from Canada into Norse culture, and viceversa.  \nChristianization And The Push Of Pagan Norse Away From The Established Norse Countries- DANMARK AND NORGE.   \nThe Protection or Claim of Newfoundland as a NORTHERN territory by either Danmark or Norge, during the Colonization of America by the Spanish - French - English.  \n& Beyond.\n\nHistory truly is far interesting and complex, while maintaining a simple, dark marker of our human natures.   \nInformation on Freydis,   \n[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyd%C3%ADs_Eir%C3%ADksd%C3%B3ttir)   \n[B-Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/how-an-angry-viking-changed-the-face-of-america-2011-9)\n\n\\-Word of advice (two), do not believe information as factual before doing your part in proving its accuracy, if there's other fellows that would like to shed more information, please feel free.   \nTo not do so is to fall into the fool's card. You being the fool, the joke of the pack.   \nTwo, do not compare events in history to your own value, as your value is steeped in modern, 2020-esque life.   \nHardships, belief, culture, worth, all these things change with time and the flow of people, ideas. Currently I wonder, what will people think, 50 years from now, and if we will be in our space pods, in space, or virtually. Will things matter, as they matter now?   \nPhilosophy and future reddit calls me, goodbye.",

Nope. You were 'possessed by a demon' and would be rounded up by your neighbours and put on trial and then put to death. Trials weren't necessarily in a court with 12 of your peers either. Trials were the ducking stool, the rack, thumbscrews and other forms of torture. \n\nPlease bear in mind that I don't want to diss conservatives here, but just think of the impact of the British Empire and the number of religious wackjobs and right wingnutjobs who came after King James.",

It used to be invest-to-grow. Since 1990 it’s been about shrink-to-grow.

In order to discredit the knowledge of climate change (as well as the fact that the invasion of Iraq was a blunder and the Patriot Act was a horrific violation of our rights), the Bush presidency deliberately changed discourse on the national, even international, level to disregard established facts and procedures and instead favor \"because I said so.\" This fracturing trust in experts is what directly led to things like the anti-vax and flat-earth movements as well as basically paved the way for Drumpf's presidency.\n\nI said this once before on a thread about life pre-9/11 vs. post-9/11: before it felt like we were on the precipice of utopia, after it felt like the fuse had been lit on armageddon.

It didn't just affect the u.s but pretty much globally and in most country's it was made illegal. 3. It put us sooo far behind on the amount it could of been studied for it medicinal properties. 4. Could of been used as a natural pain med. Instead of getting everyone addicted to pain meds. Which as you know created the opiate epidemic. 5. All the ppl who have been arrested for growing, smoking, or possession. Many have acquired felonys over a harmless natural plant. These ppl couldn't get good paying jobs because there record. Not to mention all the tax payers who pay for each individual who served time because they smoked. So like I said it may not be the worst thing that ever happened but if you look into how much we spent i.e taxpayers. It played a huge role in putting the US in debt",

His Reaganomics relied on the \"trickle down effect\", which was basically helping businesses gain money in a very quick manner, and these gains were supposedly going to \"trickle down\" to the every day worker. Did that happen? Even today, while billionaires gain more ground, many workers have been sitting at a minimum wage of $7.25 for 12 years, even though the cost of living has exponentially increased. Even if you just look at inflation alone, the last time that minimum wage was raised in 2009, that same dollar is worth just $0.73 today, yet we are having trouble getting a new minimum wage passed? Want to guess why? Well, follow the money. Money = power in America, and raising the minimum  wage would take money out of the 1% pocket. Thank Ronald Reagan for just handing over all the power in the US to to 1%.",

This is in response to his action and inaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe received information in late January of the worry of a new, very infectious virus appearing i. Wuhan, China. He sat on this information and chose not to disseminate it to the public for fears the apprehension would tank the stock market. Trump had for the entirety of his Presidency equated the stock market to his economic success. He also made no effort to rebuild the emergency supplies that were depleted during the Swine Flu epidemic. \n\nAs cases appeared in the US in March and early April. He public downplayed the virus, saying the US cases would be zero, symptoms were not much worst than the flu and that the virus would diminish with heat. Again he privately was receiving information that COVID-19 was more contagious and more severe than the flu.  He chose again to sit on the information because he knew that it would drastically effect the stock market.\n\nBy May as many cities were being hit he formed a task force, this task force specifically chose not to act in aide because at the time the most impacted cities were the densely populated Democratically run cities. \n\nAs experts were asking for mitigation efforts like masking, social distancing and remote learning Trump politicized the issue. He refused to acknowledge how masks would help, intentionally made sure photo ops of him were without a mask because he felt it made him look weak, propagated the narrative that only those who are afraid are wearing masks and intentionally fought against remote learning because he knew it would take some individuals out of the workforce potentially hurting the economy.\n\nHe talked up BS treatments of COVID including the malaria and RI drug hydroxychloroquine. This created a large run on the drug as hospitals scrambled to get product just in case, disrupting the supply chain  and hurting patients who needed the meds. Hydroxychloriquine was subsequently found to have no effect on COVID treatment.\n\nAfter he tested positive for COVID he continues to downplay his symptoms despite needing to be flown by helicopter to Walter Reed because his oxygen dropped to concerning level. While at Walter Reed he received the experimental monoclonal antibody treatment Regeneron which reduced symptoms but was not available to the public. After this treatment he continued to downplay COVID seriousness and masks making a huge show of removing his when returning from Walter Reed.\n\nDespite pushing the vaccine as a huge accomplishment when in office, after he lost the election he made no significant statement towards recommending the vaccine. This would have gone a long way to convincing his supporters it was the right thing to do. It is also despite being vaccinated himself.\n\nSeizing on to Trump fervent fan base and the already politicized mask issue many Republican Governors have now banned mask mandates in their state.\n\nWith mitigation efforts being thrown out, vaccine hesitancy and the delta variant our hospital systems are once again being taxed. This time however it is effecting the unvaccinated and the young more heavily. Thousands of children have been hospitalized so far from the delta variant.\n\nOver 600k Americans have died from COVID-19. Trump decisions during the early stages of the pandemic politicized mitigation efforts that could have prevented a majority of those deaths. The death toll is still rising as over 700 Americans are dying daily and that rate is steadily increasing.",

Communism killed far more people then fascism, or even the most extreme religions throughout history. This is because of Communism's lack of individualism. Most traditional religions believe that humans inherently have souls, meaning there lives matter. There is none of this in Communism. The emphasise is places on the group, meaning horrible atrocities can be justified as human life doesn't matter and if it benefits the collective it is justified. People are going to try to argue, saying that wasn't real communism. True communism is impossible because of a lack of checks and balances that allow extreme loss of life, if it benefits the collective. This has allowed Tyrants like Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin to murder millions of people. The Russian empire before Communism, had one of the highest birthrates in the world at 6 children per women. Communism has caused Russia's population to stagnate and millions die, in order to industrialize. Chairman Mao was the second mass murderer in history. Second only to Genghis Khan and in front of another communist, Stalin. I know Karl marx is not directly responsible for this, but had he never written the communist manifesto, the world would be alot different.",

Legitimizing Christianity created the conditions for keeping the Dark Ages around for centuries through fear, set up “divine rule” for feudal and monarchy “governments”, and stagnated progress for centuries (Inquisitions anyone?).  At the same time, it made Constantinople much more stable, which led to the rise of the Byzantine Empire.  Christianity eventually led to the creation of Islam.  Thanks to the Byzantine upkeep of eastern Roman roads and trade routes, it gave Islam an easy way to spread quickly, leading to the Moorish invasion of Europe…  which of course led to the multiple Crusades.  Plus, the Christian pope of Alexandria had the last remaining bit of the Library of Alexandria destroyed in the 4th century.\n\nSo, he created the conditions that led to:\n\n-Rise of the 2 largest religions.\n\n-Eventual downfall of Roman Empire and loss of its tech for centuries\n\n-The Dark Ages, Inquisitions, Crusades\n\nPLUS, there’s the butterfly effect of things that we couldn’t possibly know, and hypothesize at best…  The Americas, Trans-Atlantic slave trade, Dutch East India Co, English expansion for centuries, etc.  This one guy single handedly changed the direction the world was going in, and arguably led to the stagnation of mankind.",

He did it solely in order to gather personal wealth (he was ridiculously in debt) and in doing so annihilated entire cultures from Europe, set forth hundreds of years of regional aggression, and forever shifted Rome from its cultural and growth 'economy' onto a path of petty, grunting decline. All of the wonders we think of from the 'Roman' world are pre-Caesar.\n\nHe intentionally provoked a civil war in Rome that ultimately destroyed the Republic. He stoked populist fervor, and then left the masses to suffer through war after war after war. People, for some reason, sometimes look back on this (civil war) as a positive, but how they handle the cognitive dissonance isn't clear. Yes, the sort of oligarchy and corruption under the Republic was getting horrendous, but it was the line of 'Caesars,' starting with Julius Caesar, that destroyed the Roman world and brought forth all the petty, personal corruption (Tiberius, Caligula, Nero) we remember today. It also set the precedent for the 1,700+ years of hereditary monarchy in-fighting in Europe that decisively moved the continent away from the Greek template of democracy.\n\nCaesar wanted to be a King, a tyrant, and he set the template to take power away from elections, trained officials, and anything resembling a meritocracy and set the foundation in both thought and action to create a hereditary power structure that brought forth the insane, petty, and worthless. The idea of social mobility and invention literally became threats to 'power' under the Caesars and were punished, usually by death. The result? About 1,000 years of nothingness in European history. Religious squabbles, inbreeding noble families, and the prevailing belief that authority matters more than reason, when Europe had, decisively, made it's greatest gains when the OPPOSITE belief was prevailing.\n\nAll the subsequent failures of the Caesars fall on Julius because he made them possible. He sat at the cross-roads when strength and perspective could have rebuilt Rome and cleaned it of its oligarchical failings, he could have saved the Republic and the future of Europe. Instead, he crossed the Rubicon.\n\nHe also admitted to burning down the Library of Alexandria. And while it is true there was more than one fire that destroyed the collection, remember this was a collection of between 500,000 - 800,000 texts from the ancient world on everything from astronomy, rhetoric, to medicine and poetry. It was the pilgrimage site for the greatest minds in the ancient world. The casual loss of this and the other cultural riches in the lands Caesar invaded cannot be understated. It set a precedent for Rome that was used in the worst possible way for the remainder of its history. Yes, militaries throughout history did this sort of garbage before, but he was personally responsible for the extinction of entire city-states, possibly languages, and unfathomable knowledge.\n\nAnd the fact so many throughout history have pointed to him as inspiration, as a 'good' leader or as a charismatic positive role model is exactly the problem. This creature who embodied everything the educated or enlightened mind is meant to detest has somehow persisted for over 2,000 years as an 'impressive' part of history. **No, he was a genocidal, rapist, war criminal, who was always in debt, a want-to-be tyrant who would rather destroy an entire civilization than see it run by calmer, more educated mild-mannered men than himself.** Spit on his grave. Be weary of ANYONE who respects him.\n\nThe conspirators were right, Caesar needed to die. If only Augustus had too.\n\nEdit: Apparently Mark Zuckerberg (the thing that brought the world Facebook) has a man-crush on Augustus Caesar. Figures.",

Science? philosophy? etc. What counts as progress and how do we measure it's overall importance to Humanity?- this is a very complex and loaded question and an aswer will largly depend on the opinons of who is asking and answering it on what they personally see as 'progress' and how they rate said progress.) That minor philosophical rant out of the way, my first choice for the individual who did the most damage to Human progress would be [**Cyril of Alexandria**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_of_Alexandria)**,** this so-called saint preached in Roman Egypt during the later days of the Empire, by that time Christianity had been Legalised by Emperor Constantine. He preached a creed of blind faith in men of the church and the scriptures, he rallied against Philosphy, Science and religious tolerence. Cyril was the one who's rhetoric inspired a violent mob of extreamists to murder the famous female philosopher [Hypatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia) in 415CE. Cyril also led Pogroms against the Jews of Alexandria and eventually  seized all of their property and had them expelled from the city. His intolerence also extended to art and literature, under his orders numerous statues, murals and mosaics that were considered ''Pagan'' or ''idolatry''  were defaced or completly destroyed, Books on science medicene and philosphy that contradicted the Bible eg. by claiming the world was round (Something the Romans had long known about by this point) were burnt and the last remnants of the Great library of Alexandria were all completly demolished and their contents consigned to the flames. The Christian  extreamism in Alexandria and elswere in the Roman Empire during the 400sCE led by men like Cyril, had as much, if not more impact on the loss of classical Greek, Roman and other Ancient Knowlage than the contemorary invasions of barbarians like the Franks, Goths or Huns.\n\nFor my second choice, would be, this is Quit a controverial one : **Christopher Columbus**, While his ''discovery'' of the Americas in 1492 is often sighted as a major advace for Humanity, the following genocides and loss of cultures, languages, knowlage  and the establishment of industrial Slavery in the Americas (Which Columbus helped start up by importing Africans to work on plantations in Hispaniola) was ultimatly more damaging (in my opinion) to the progression of the Human race, than the benifits of the Columbian Exchange and better understanding the geography of Earth that it gave (And yes they already had re-discoverd the world was round many years before he set sail on the Santa maria; he was trying to circumnavigate a rought to Asia to trade for Spices.)

Born as a christian, he returned to paganism as soon as he became emperor, because he was a quiet well educated man in many ways. As the last pagan emperor he tried to reform the state in such ways so christianity wouldnt keep on spreading. For example, during his reign he forbade christians to teach ancient texts, because christians teachers corrupted their contents and misinformed their students. Sadly Julian was killed in a pesian campaign, but we still dont know who killed him. He either died by a persian lance or was murdered by a christian in his own ranks. (Many christians applauded his death)\n\nIf julian hadnt died, he couldve changed rome back to paganism, as i think the majority still was at that time. Christianity has caused some serious issues in the empire. Just a few years later, rome and the western empire fell, contributing to that were the christian eastern romans which refused to help because western rome was still in large part pagan. Much of ancient science, literature.... was lost because christians refused to copy the majority of them, as they were heresy. They rather copy 100 times an unimportant holy book.

So people were more divided by language and culture, some by religion.\n \nFrance and Britain decided to carve up the Middle-East into easier to govern territories, but fumbled this task and instead divided the territories on the map OVER these religious and tribal lines.\n\nNot only has this been a main contributing cause of conflict in the Middle-East (if you take two opposing or rival groups and then suddently group them as one country, what do you expect...) but said conflicts have then fuelled further conflicts agian and again.\n\nThis has then been further used by Islamic extremists as a reason to hate the western powers, as they were the ones who created this terrible agreement. Even Sykes himself accepted that the agreement’s wording should be changed in order to give those countries autonomous rule.\n\nWhat is a little sad is he actually seemed to want to help these regions with the agreement, but just bumbled the whole thing which has led to most of the issues the Middle-East has to this day.\n\nSykes didn't make the modern Middle-East though, he just played a large part in creating the circumstances in which its current problems thrive. Imagine all of the advancement, education and collaboration that could have happened had the Middle-East been allowed to flourish unhindered and without resentment?",

            "text": "Emperor Gaozong of China. This is kind of an obscure story, so let me tell you the whole thing.. It was the 12th century. when people talk about how China used to be the most technologically advanced part of the world, this is the period they're talking about. Some historians that they were on the brink of industrializing. Then Manchuria invaded and conquered northern China. The imperial court retreated to the south and declared Gaozong, the Emperor's brother, as the new Emperor.\n\nChina's top general Yue Fei (who, according to some records, literally had \"patriotism\" tattooed on his back, though that might have been made up by a someone who wanted to emphasis how unfair the rest of this story is) rallied he army and defeated the Manchus, and was raring to chase them out, but he gets orders from Gaozong to back down, because he'd rather negotiate. These negotiations end up signing away the north half of China.\n\nA few years later, the Manchus invade again. Yue Fei beats them again and pushes all the way back to the old capital (Kaifeng). Then he gets the order to retreat. He responds with a letter saying that he's got the Manchus on the ropes, and he can reconquer Northern China in like a month. No, says the emperor, retreat immediately. Eventually, Yue Fei does retreat, but he delays long enough to evacuate the city first, making up some logistical issues as an excuse.\n\nAt this point, you may be wondering why Gaozong was so reluctant to push an advantage. The answer is that his brother was still alive- the king of Manchuria liked to bring him out once in a while and make fun of him. If Yue Fei reconquered China, he might liberate the rightful emperor, and Gaozong would be out of a job. As such, Gaozong was actively trying to throw the war.\n\nAnd he interpreted Yue Fei's delay at the end of this war as meaning that he had reached the point of at least considering going rogue, so as soon as Yue Fei got back, he was arrested, and promptly executed on treason on the ground of of \"err...he might have done something\". Presumably because the optics on the actual charge- \"Almost winning a war we wanted to lose.\" were too bad. People realize that this is bull quickly enough, and there are protests, but Gaozong manages to pin everything on one of his advisors and placated the mob by executing him.\n\nSo how does this effect the long-term progression of Humanity? Well, as I said, China might have been on the brink of industrializing at the time, but didn't have access to enough coal. There are coal deposits in China, but they're all in the north. Second, the Manchus never really got their internal issues sorted out, and 70 years later, were easily conquered by the Mongols, who then recruited a bunch of disaffected Chinese siege engineers. This essentially removed the one weakness of horse-archer hordes- they're not good at taking fortresses- and allowed them to wreck half the world. Had China been united at the time (and had been ruled fairly recently by a guy who had, if you recall, been taken prisoner by invaders from the north, so you can bet the defenses would be fairly well maintained) they probably could not have done this. So had it not been for the malice of this one man, the Mongols would probably never have become the juggernaut they eventually did and the Industrial Revolution might have happened about 500 years head of schedule.",

This was the beginning of an era of isolation for Chinese kingdoms, which ultimately lead to the collapse of imperial China, and indirectly to the rise of the PRC. Additionally, the wealth of the world overall decreased as a result of reduced trade with China, and if China had continued exploring it is possible that they, not Europeans, would have colonized North America (instead of merely *maybe* discovering it then telling no one as they did in history). \n\nIt may not be a significant alteration of human progress, but it’s one of those events that sets the world in a definitively different direction.\n\nEdit: didn’t say the Chinese *did* discover America, just that they *might have* because it’s been theorized that they did and they had the technology (I mean, the Inuit and Siberians have been crossing the Bering Sea in leather kayaks for thousands of years, so the Chinese definitely could have done it too if they wandered up that far). I don’t know much about the actual history of that theory, and most of my comments on that are from Wikipedia searches this morning and willingness to believe fun “hidden history” scenarios that are actually possible.\n\nThanks for all the upvotes!",

Civilian populations were targeted and women were subject to rape by upwards of 20 soldiers before being slaughtered. This treatment would also be given to young teenage girls. Babies were butchered with bayonets and prisoners of war were slaughtered like livestock by new recruits who were forced to kill so that they could be bled early and not hesitate when it came time for combat. The ethnonationalism was quite literally the Asian equivalent of Nazi Germany’s vision of the aryan race being superior. Hell, there was even a competition where two officers tried to see who could behead 100 prisoners the fastest that ended up making it into a newspaper back in Japan as a show of Japanese nationalism. The Rape of Nanking is something that Japan has never formerly apologized for. Same goes for all of the atrocities committed in the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, and the rest of mainland China. And unfortunately close ties with Japan in tandem with guilt over dropping two nuclear bombs on the country to avoid an invasion that would have undoubtedly cost the lives of millions given how the island hopping campaign up to that point had gone has warped education regarding WW2 to be focused on entirely the European Theatre. Even in HL IB history in Canada, the extent of the Pacific Theatre that was taught was a brief mention of Pearl Harbour that resulted in the USA being brought into the war after Germany declared war on the USA after the USA declared war on Japan. After that there was a brief mentioning of the nuclear bombs and that was it. Talks of WW2 almost entirely focus on Hitler, even though the Axis consisted of more members than just Hitler. Hideki Tojo and the brutality he enabled match that of Hitler himself and yet he goes largely ignored as education regarding WW2 and even far right nationalism focus solely on Hitler.",

Had Stoicism never caught on, Epicureanism might have become the dominant philosophy of the classical world. \n\nEpicurus had it right: Maximize pleasure and minimize suffering, don't fear death because you never will experience it, [the] God[s] either don't exist or they do but don't care to reward or punish humans. \n\nFor those not familiar with Epicurus, he was a hedonist, but what he advocated for was nothing like modern ideas of hedonism. Epicurus wasn't about getting drunk and having lots of sex and binge eating food, he believed that the best pleasures were found in things like friendship, and that one would experience more overall pleasure with moderation because they wouldn't suffer addiction and the consequences of excess.\n\nBut most importantly, Epicurus believed the prime directive to be the minimization of suffering. Freedom from suffering being the highest pleasure, it is much more important than to take away pain than to seek pleasure. \n\nImagine how different this world would be if humans operated on the idea that we should be doing everything we can to minimize everyone's suffering at all times.\n\nSadly, Stoicism one and Stoicism believing that all good is found in virtue, this helped result in a world where we value our ideas of justice over compassion. And in pursuit of faulty notions of justice and fairness, we not only deliberately inflict suffering on wrongdoers, we inflict it on ourselves. \n\nGranted, Christianity would have still come along and it would have had a major influence, but if Christianity stood upon an Epicurean foundation rather than a stoic one, I believe that something is the vein of liberation theology would be the dominant Christian ideal today.",

To put this in perspective, Rome in the first century AD was gradually rebuilding after the Great Fire of 64AD, but was completely unmechanised, and so relied on the manpower of slaves. \n\nAn engineer stepped forward to the Emperor positing that he had invented a type of crane that could transport heavy marble to the capital with ease, essentially doing the work of a hundred men and making short work of this, and other building projects.\n\nVespasian responded by paying the man a fortune – in return for him destroying the plans! The reason? Vespasian feared that the rapid mechanisation of Rome would stunt the city's precarious network of petty capitalism and hierarchy of master-slave units. \"How,\" he asked the engineer, \"would you expect me to feed my commons?\"\n\nOne wonders what Vespasian could have achieved if he had implemented this machinery. The end of slavery in Rome? Introducing prosperity to the wider Roman Empire? At the very least, we could have had an even more monumental Rome, with incredible marble buildings that would have made the city un-sackable. \n\nWe will never know.

We don't know why they suddenly burned the fleet, but one theory is that they wanted to stop free trade and protect local industries. As a result, Chinese technological innovation stagnated, they missed the industrial revolution, and only recovered their position of economic dominance in the last ten years. \n\nNow you could argue that this just affects China, rather than humanity as a whole. But I'd give two replies. First, China has a large fraction of all of humanity. Second, progress is measured by how many new ideas you can produce. If you cut off such a large fraction of idea-producing agents just when ideas can have the most impact, it makes it the most damaging event in the history of mankind.",

The Library was part of a larger research institution called the Mouseion, which was dedicated to the Muses, the nine goddesses of the arts.[10] The idea of a universal library in Alexandria may have been proposed by Demetrius of Phalerum, an exiled Athenian statesman living in Alexandria, to Ptolemy I Soter, who may have established plans for the Library, but the Library itself was probably not built until the reign of his son Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The Library quickly acquired many papyrus scrolls, due largely to the Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.",

He was the head of the commission appointed by the UK government to examine and report on the progress of AI. While a lot of his observations were true, the report and the outcomes were way too harsh. As the result of the report, funding was cut to the AI researchers. A lot of them left the field w/o leaving any apprentices who would've been able to continue their work. Programming in general took a turn to the worse, favoring languages like C++, and later Java.\n\n----\n\nYet another candidate AT&T with their first ever Web advertisement. Ultimately, ads subverted the goals of Web from being an international distributed knowledge base into an application distribution platform sustained by advertisement. The vision of the world sharing, storing and refining its knowledge is no more, it was rolled under the pavement by the entertainment industry.\n\nI used to work with the guy who claimed that he was the author of the first ever ad, meaning that one from AT&T.

Enough to institute his crazy ideas about biology (which dismissed Mendel's genetics as anti-Marxist). Since his ideology resonated so well with what the regime wanted everyone to believe, he gained a lot of power, stalling the development of Soviet science for decades.\n\nSimilarly Yaroshevski was responsible for blaming cybernetics (or as we would call it today, computer science) for being a scam in the service of world's capitalism and militarism. Something that aligned well with the political ideas of the Soviet Union in the 50-60.

His philosophy revolves around one core concept; subservience, and has basically condemned Sinic cultural sphere to the way it is today.\n\nUnder the dehumanising instructions of Confucian ideals, grassroots plurality and intellectual vibrancy never took hold in the Sinosphere. It's such a shame that the world's largest civilisation bloc for most of the past twenty centuries couldn't proportionally contribute to our species' progress because of the misguided convictions of a man who, in an effort to dissuade people from the conflict and violence that he saw, swung too far in the other direction and created a philosophy of obsequiousness.\n\nBecause of Confucius, every generation of East Asian grew up to be 'damaged goods,' and it's well known that abusive upbringings are vicious cycles, condemning succeeding generations to the same treatment. Regardless of 20th century politics or politicians, this phenomenon is common to all East Asians from Chinese to Koreans to, albeit a lesser extent, Japanese. The root cause goes beyond colloquially blamed political boogeymen and stems from a culture that has had millennia to establish nigh indestructible mental roots. Emigration doesn't improve anything and overseas Asian families continue to indoctrinate their children to be subservient and defer unconditionally to seniority. I posit a lot of the ethnic jokes perpetrated by Asian 2nd and 3rd-gens are coping mechanisms in response to toxic and degrading upbringings.\n\nAn illustrative example for how ingrained the dogma is, consider that Mao Zedong, the most powerful ruler China has had in the past three centuries, failed utterly to overturn Confucius and the backlash to his attempt basically destroyed whatever was left of his legacy after his GLF fuckup. If Mao, with all his power, couldn't dislodge Confucian culture from the conscience of a population that, at the time, basically worshipped him, who the hell else could even get close?\n\nTL;DR: fuck Confucius, the shithead behind the continued mental abuse of Asian kids.",

Krupp was also a weirdo who refused to sleep in one room for more than a few hours, lest his breathing suck the oxygen of the air and kill him.

The concept of nature vs. nurture, the use of survey questionnaires, and some of the most basic statistical assumptions like central tendency and regression to the mean that are core to regression techniques like are a given today, but imagine trying to answer important scientific questions without these tools prior?\n\nIf only the best ideas and methods from this period of scientific history were not integrally connected to scientific racism. Imagine a world where things like intelligence, inherited trait level differences, and the intersection of genetic and cultural factors in explaining individual and group level differences were not tied to a mission to justify the superiority of white men, and instead could have been used to dismantle systems of oppression rather than perpetuate them. \n\nThe insidiousness of the scientific racism introduced by Galton that was core to the eugenics movement is so widespread it is hard to recognize in current everyday life. Many people learn (or should learn) about how IQ tests were designed explicitly around the assumption of white people as of a superior intelligence to other racial groups in a backwards effort that continues to this day. But also take the Body Mass Index as an example. BMI is a flawed and crude measure of the relationship between and individual’s height and weight relative to a population that is used as an indirect metric for health. This came directly out of Galton’s work to quantify human value based on preconceived assumptions of white and male superiority. It is an immense shame that we could have had a period of post-Darwinian enlightenment in secular science and instead we are now further entrenched into the worst societal consequences of the eugenics movement brought about by Galton and his followers.",

The Cherokee Nation was on track to become another US state.  They were a civilized and christian people who would have integrated nicely into the US as a new state and would likely have influenced the nation to be far less racially motivated.  Now consider for a moment that the nation at this time was not as racially charged as many would have you believe.  As a matter of fact there were many caucasians that were perfectly willing to live with and even marry into the cherokee.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHad the Cherokee nation become a state (where alabama and mississippi currently sit) it would have been an economic farming powerhouse and changed the entire way that we view the culture of the south.  it would have paved the way for ending slavery sooner, and denied the southern states enough of a foothold to even begin a civil war.  I believe this would have also paved the way for less racial segregation and more integration with mexico, ultimately paving the way for the annexation of mexico, and then the central american states.

Like, as I think climate change is currently heading us down a path...where we could literally all die, I want to say like...CEOs of large corporations, but individually it would be hard to choose one person. I guess Jeff Bezos comes to mind, but I think I'll go with the Koch brothers. I think they have a large hand in leading the United States to do nothing about climate change. \n\nAlternate and insane idea I've recently stumbled upon though : Ghengis Khan. So, not because of his actual destruction, but because..still I think climate change will be the greatest threat to humanity...and Ghengis may have a large hand in the reason Europe was able to industrialize first. Okay reasons Ming China, the Ottoman Empire, and the Mughal Empire did not industrialize are commonly named as China looking inward, the Ottoman's already controlling the trade routes that Europe wish to explore...and honestly I am not sure for the Mughals. Anyways though, these three empires were richer, and had higher levels of innovation and technology right up to the point the Portuguese and then Spanish Empires emerged. However, what a lot of people forget is...the Mongol Empire destroyed Baghdad and other west and central Asian cities to the point that those cities have never recovered TO TODAY. Even as South Asia and West Asia recovered from Ghengis and his son's destruction, Europe was catching up. See Western Europe was never conquered (there is argument as to why). Oh and Ming China. Well, they looked inward, and they strengthened their defenses, and they stopped looking outside of China. You know, like a country that had been invaded and conquered by their still present northern neighbors might do. Listen this is an insane theory, and I would have to do much more study to claim anything, but..if Ghengis did play a large hand in the reason Western Europe was able to industrialize first...who knows, maybe they would have set up a less destructive version of capitalism and industrialisation. Impossible to say of course, but..Europe's interactions with other areas of the world...were rather oppressive and destructive. AGain though, this is insanity, just go with the Koch Brothers instead.",

This idea(spirit) is pervasive through out history and responsible for every war. People like Hitler are really of little consequence. If you went back in time and killed Hitler as a baby. A new person would rise to fill that position and Nazi Germany would occur anyway. Because the spirit of fascism didn’t live in him alone but in the hearts of and consciousness of many.

This was a huge social slight and basically the Washington society version of the finger and launched a years long feud between Andrew Jackson and John Calhoun, ultimately culminating in the nullification crisis of 1832- which may have been the last off ramp on the road leading to the civil war. Had the sectional conflict de-escalated rather than ramping up, it’s possible to imagine a political climate where slavery was eliminated via compensated or gradual emancipation (like [most other places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_abolition_of_slavery_and_serfdom)). Instead of peaceful emancipation, we got war, reconstruction and Jim Crowe. Maybe it’s wishful thinking to assume US race relations would have been as good as other countries were post-emancipation, but I feel like there were several better potential outcomes than the strife that we got and still have to this day. So, thanks for that  Folride Calhoun I guess",

Here's an excerpt of what he did that definitively brought down the golden age of the Muslim world.\n> Abu Hamid Al Ghazali, who lived from 1055 to 1111, single-handedly steered Islamic culture away from independent scientific inquiry towards religious fundamentalism. In a remarkable intellectual shift, he concluded that falsafa (which literally means philosophy but included logic, mathematics and physics) was incompatible with Islam.\n\n> \n\nAfter writing his book, The Incoherence of Philosophers, Algazel as he was known in medieval Europe, is said to have \"stabbed falsafa in such a manner that it could not rise again in the Muslim world\". Thanks to his unparalleled mastery of falsafa and Islamic law, he injected repugnance among Muslims for science that ultimately led to its decline and, in the process, the decline of Islamic civilisation.\n\n\n[source ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/how-the-decline-of-muslim-scientific-thought-still-haunts-1.382129%3foutputType=amp)",

Woodrow fucking Wilson, 28th president of the United States of America. Why you may ask? Allow me to give you a list:\n\n-a staunch proponent of the \"lost cause\" mentality in southern US leading to Jim crow, the kkk (he was also a silent proponent of them too), racial troubles in general we have now a days and logically speaking the culture wars of now\n\n-started the idea of American exceptionalism. That being the idea that America must 'guide the world' by intervening in every single conflict that effected American ideals (in reality, everything that effects the US moneybag)\n\n-world War 1 could have just not lasted as long had wilson jumped into the war earlier thus not leading to the ussr (due to Germany later in the war sending Lenin to Russia as a means to start a revolt and pull them out of the war. Surprisingly ingenious and worked) let alone the countless mindless deaths that could have been avoided entirely \n\n-layed the ground word for invasion of privacy like the nsa and the patriot act with the invention and frequent use of the Espionage Act. If you even so much as spoke ill about America during the war, jail.\n\n-the selective service act. Me personally I'm not a fan of it so I won't say it's the worst thing in the world because it was nesscessary for world war 2 BUT (see next point here)\n\n-world war 2 could have possibly been avoided had Woodrow wilson and the rest was of the board there not entirely blame Germany and put all the responsibility of restoration on them even though it was multiple country's  fault.\n\n-the middle east countries wouldn't be a powder keg like today due to himself and the other country's at the treaty allowed some representation of middle eastern countries there to draw up some of the borders rather than haphazardly slapping lines down and letting people fight about it\n\nI can go on and on about this fucking failure of a president but I'd rather not word Wall more than I have currently.

But I also hear that about the bubonic plague (which the Mongols helped spread). Why one is it? Take your pick. But revolutionary change is unlikely to require *both* Mongol invasions and plague. More likely it is just a bad argument, and it is severely overestimating how stagnant those established civilizations were. Islam in this period, until it met the Mongols, was going through a golden age in which they were making giant leaps in the sciences. It is said that the lake outside Baghdad became black with the ink of all the books that the Mongols threw into it.\n* As well as the historical arsonists, there are many unintended consequences that did profound harm which lasted for generations. The most recent example might be the neoliberal system started by people like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. This out of control culture of mass consumption is wrecking the Earth, and it may take the most enormous ingenuity and prodigious technology to terraform the future Earth back into something like its old state before the neoliberal period.\n* But I would also add Karl Marx to unintended consequences. Leftism certainly did not start with him but was already a flourishing intellectual subculture in the 19th century. He was a very talented philosopher and I agree with a lot of his analysis, but ultimately it was the rage in his pages that had the most far-reaching consequences, and inspired a lot of the mass murder in the 20th century, even if Marx himself would have been horrified by it. Without Marx it is almost certain that the trade union movement would have continued advancing.",

Although he single-handedly couldn’t have made much of a difference in his lifetime, his texts had a lot of ripple effects in subcontinent which can be seen even today. It ordained only a tiny fraction of population, *Brahmins* (priests) to hold onto the “knowledge” and pass it on among themselves and some of it to *Kshatriyas* (kings and warriors) and *Vaishyas* (merchants and businessmen). This resulted in a setback and stagnation in learning and sciences as the majority of the population (*shudras* and lower castes) wasn’t allowed to become literate. In an area with such a huge population, this definitely caused a huge waste of potential over thousands of years.\n\nIt had barbarous and stupid rules like “Pour molten lead into a Shudra’s ears if he listens to the vedas (holy texts of Hinduism) and cut off his tongue if he dares to recite them”, “a person who leaves the shore and travels in the ocean loses his caste” (they considered all foreigners and their cultures to be impure). \n\nI put knowledge in quotation marks because there were also limitations to learning, for example “a Brahmin shouldn’t touch or handle a dead body”, etc. so dissection of human bodies and learning about its anatomy in detail was out of the question.\n\nExplaining the varna system: Most people were classified into four *varnas* (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras) and the rest are untouchables. The Brahmins were the ones who held the knowledge, the Kshatriyas were kings and warriors who protected the other varnas under the guidance of the Brahmins, the Vaishyas were traders and merchants, and the Shudras were commoners, people whose job was to serve the other three varnas by doing service oriented jobs like carpentry, pottery, etc.",

Without his reimagining of Jesus’ teachings, the Christian church likely never would have grown to be the world power that it did. \n\nFrom Reza Aslans book: “The choice between James’s vision of a Jewish religion anchored in the Law of Moses and derived from a Jewish nationalist who fought against Rome, and Paul’s vision of a Roman religion that divorced itself from Jewish provincialism and required nothing for salvation save belief in Christ, was not a difficult one for the second and third generations of Jesus’s followers to make.\nTwo thousand years later, the Christ of Paul’s creation has utterly subsumed the Jesus of history. The memory of the revolutionary zealot who walked across Galilee gathering an army of disciples with the goal of establishing the Kingdom of God on earth, the magnetic preacher who defied the authority of the Temple priesthood in Jerusalem, the radical Jewish nationalist who challenged the Roman occupation and lost, has been almost completely lost to history.”",

Frequently, in the 50s and 60s, test subjects with addictions got clean after a single dose for months at a time, with some staying away for good. \n\nNixon wanted war in Korea. Americans protested, particularly young people. Nixon made them scapegoats, as well as their mind opening drug of choice, psychedelics. \n\nFor decades, world governments didn't really allow clinical trials to test these drugs. In the last decade, thats changed, and once again we are seeing the same results as before. \n\nI think if we could have had continued research from the 50s onward, the world of mental health and how to treat it would be vastly different. \n\nGood this alcohol and cigarettes were always around for us though 😎👉👉",

Progression of humanity needs the work of living humans so wars and genocide would be the best way to prevent it (more than spreading misinformation or restricting certain activities, which the top comments suggested). \n\n 2. Progression is exponential so look at events in human history as early as possible\n\n3. Pinpointing single humans responsible for some of these events is next to impossible but we could use the rulers that initiated the conflict.\n\n4. Obviously massive caveat that we can't really judge how much more useful those lives would have been if they died at some point later or how much more would they have lived longer (maybe they would have died of famine 10 years later if not for the war), that is to say, I look at single events in isolation to limit work and speculation.\n\nSo with those in mind, Genghis Khan comes to mind whose invasion killed 4 million people at the very very least (likely 40-60 million). That is devastating even by modern standards but especially crippling in the 13th century (when population was estimated to be around 400 million).\n\nAt the cost of being controversial, one could also argue for roman emperor Constantine the Great for accepting Christianity but it would be a cheap shot blaming him for all the crusades and other killings in the name of Christianity. Remember that I look at these examples in a vacuum so someone else might have done it after him or not doing it may have resulted in more death, but I refrain from speculating.\n\nAs an honourable mention, one could mention the final burning of the library of Alexandria by Caliph Omar (Julius Caesar and Theophilus burned it previously, although not necessarily on purpose).",

Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among many others: Zenodotus of Ephesus, who worked towards standardizing the texts of the Homeric poems; Callimachus, who wrote the Pinakes, sometimes considered to be the world's first library catalogue; Apollonius of Rhodes, who composed the epic poem the Argonautica; Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who calculated the circumference of the earth within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; Aristophanes of Byzantium, who invented the system of Greek diacritics and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and Aristarchus of Samothrace, who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. Just imagine some of the most important people who contributed to studying anything that you knew about, put their life's info in this library, and then burn it down. Any country could have used this library to contribute their knowledge in warfare, politics, or etc to help their nation, but instead it was burnt down during a Roman civil war.",

He was laying the groundwork for the scientific method and experimentation under his “we are blind and it’s beautiful” philosophy (which is how all scientists define their work today), which encouraged scientists and philosophers to admit their limits, admit when we are limited by our tools of perception, and continually look deeper into our world.\n\nWith crafty language and a reliance on people’s desire to have simple answers, Aristotle’s simplistic theory of chemistry won out. IMO Aristotle’s theories laid the foundation for dark/middle age sciences, and they lasted well past the 16th century. A huge part of this was his eloquence and his stature as one of the smartest minds from Greek philosophy, which allowed future governments, rulers, great minds, etc. to put down theories and experiments that would upend Aristotle’s theory. \n\nIt took some major advances in scientific research, data collection, and the tools used to perceive chemical reactions to fully dethrone Aristotle as the leading mind on chemistry. I’m the meantime, scientific fields stagnated for hundreds of years, simply because Aristotle had a pleasing theory that didn’t leave any questions unanswered.",

            "text": "Thomas Midgley Jr. \n\nHe played a major role in development of tetraethyllead ( leaded gasoline ) which went into mass production throughout the 1920’s. This invention meant that the blood lead content in developing children rose causing numerous problems, including cognitive issues and physical growth, it was also noticed that the rise in blood lead content matched with violence in adolescents in multiple countries.\n\nMidgley is also accountable for the discovery of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) specifically Freon which as many know had a drastic impact on the Ozone. As of October 2020 the Ozone hole above Antarctica sits approximately 23 million square kilometres /8.9 million miles.\n\nAlthough, these 2 inventions seem insignificant  compared to more drastic actions taken by other single humans its the widespread impacts that his inventions had and are still being felt today. Even though both, leaded gasoline and CFC’s, have been banned.\n\nPs: the last invention made by Midgley actually killed him. it was to help him manoeuvre and get out of bed with the use of ropes and pulleys due to him contracting polio but he got stuck and eventually his invention strangled himself\n\nEDIT: this reply doesn’t quite fit the post but i felt that he had a large impact on society during the 20th century",

The atomic age (especially weapons) may have still come about but it was certainly hastened by WWII.

He made it so that everything has equal credibility, no matter how obscure or stupid.\n\nIf he got called on anything, like putting disinfectant and UV light into people, he says it was a joke, and obviously meant as a joke, and you're stupid for not getting the joke. People should know that you're stupid, not trustworthy.\n\nSo now we live in a word where not only does everyone have their freedom of speech, but they demand a megaphone to spread their stupidity, calling it their right, and damning you for questioning it when you provide proven facts that oppose what they say.\n\nEverything is a verbal fist fight now, and sometimes devolves into an actual fist fight.

I have a summary here but if you’re interested, [this](https://youtu.be/8BIcAZxFfrc) is where I learned this from. This video contains sources below if you’d like to check them. \n\nAndrew Wakefield wrote the infamous study in the 90s that falsely claimed that vaccines had a correlation with autism. He claimed that the combined MMR vaccine (a combination of three vaccines) had potential to cause a made-up “gastro-autism syndrome” after he had just filed a patent for *a separate vaccine that was not a combination.* \n\nTo clarify, he published the study to discourage people from using the combination vaccine, *did not* claim that people shouldn’t get vaccines and instead claimed that the separate vaccine (that he just patented) was safer. Immediately after the release of the paper, he had a *press conference* instead of, Idk getting it peer reviewed? This paper had a sample size of 12 children, and was based on claims their parents made about their children’s behavior “changing sometime after the vaccine,” with absolutely no other evidence to support these claims. \n\nDue to this research paper, we saw a resurgence of previously irradiated diseases, and we see lasting stigma today as people are afraid of current vaccines that could be helping to save lives. The COVID vaccine is not FDA approved, but it is the most researched vaccine to have come about in a long time, and there is no evidence to suggest it is not safe, unless already having reactions to other vaccines.",

But given that the eastern half of the empire stayed strong and stable for another hundred and so years, and given that there isn't one single event that dooms the west ... After all that study, it's tempting to reach the conclusion that it was pretty much chance. Things just kinda turned out that way. Any little tip could have changed things quite a lot.\n\nOne key event some scholars point to is the moment when Vandals conquered the provinces in North Africa and Egypt around 435. These areas provided massive amounts of grain, directly under the emperor's control, that fed the cities and armies of Rome. One scholar calls it the \"spine\" of the tax system. Once this was broken, scholars say, it became  impossible for Rome to recover.\n\nThe Vandal invasion of these provinces itself hinges on one single key event. The emperor had assembled a massive, massively expensive fleet to move in extra troops and block the Vandals from entering those provinces. One night, a very small group of Vandal vandals snuck in and burned the whole fleet. Those ships could not be replaced in time, and losing the wealth from Africa meant they couldn't be replaced at all.\n\nIf this one night, on single night, had gone differently, what would have happened? Rome had already abandoned Britain and lost pretty much all of France and Spain. But the central imperial government was not yet lost. (See: they assembled a massive fleet.) It would completely collapse about 30 years later. Keeping a stable imperial core alive in Italy, with it's ideology and bureaucracy, would have made recovery possible. It would have made a huge difference.\n\nA hundred years later, in the 500s, the eastern emperor Justinian mounted an effort to reconquer the west, and they only got as far as Italy. If Italy had been secure, they could have gone on to take Spain with ease. The elites in Southern France still thought of themselves as Roman even then, so they might have come back easy too. \n\nNow, it's an open question how much damage the Fall of Rome actually did to human progress. But archaeology makes it clear that it involved huge amounts of people dying and a massive economic step back. Engineering gets less ambitious. Aristotle gets forgotten. People *literally forget* how to maintain public baths and other infrastructure in most of the west. It's very, very hard to believe this doesn't affect the rate of scientific and economic progress. Science doesn't pick up again until population starts to increase again in the 1000s.\n\nAnd it could have come down to one person, one night, around 435 CE.",

Rather than let it die, Engels finished it.  \n\nThere is plenty to learn from Marx’s writings as a philosopher, but as a “community organizer” and economist he’s been a biblical disaster, and don’t kid yourself that the death toll has stopped counting for that school of thought.",

Entire cities experienced a significant drop in average cognitive ability because of lead poisoning.\n\nThen Midgley was instrumental in the development of freon, which was used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems. It also lead to the development of other CFC's that were widely used as propellant in aerosol sprays. These compounds are greenhouse gasses and caused depletion of the ozone layer.\n\nMidgley died by one last invention that at first seemed brilliant but was ultimately disastrous. He was infected by polio which left him mostly disabled. In order to sit up in bed and gain some semblance of independence, he built a system of ropes and pulleys to help him move.

That was when concerns (later determined to be unfounded) about the safety of a whole-cell vaccine against pertussis, or whooping cough, came to the fore in many high-income countries. In the 1980s and 1990s, a few organized groups opposed to vaccines emerged in many countries, including the United Kingdom.\n\nIt was in this context that, in 1998, Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues published a now-infamous and retracted paper in The Lancet, following which, in 2010, Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register for misconduct by the country’s General Medical Council. The fraudulent work on 12 children promoted a non-existent connection between autism and the MMR vaccine, used against measles, mumps and rubella. It propelled Wakefield to notoriety and turbocharged the anti-vaccine movement. He remains a headliner on the international vaccine-sceptic circuit as diseases once vanquished return because of falling rates of immunization. Many large epidemiological studies have found no difference in risk of developmental delays between children who receive the MMR vaccine and those who don’t.\n\nWakefield is the subject of The Doctor Who Fooled the World, a riveting new book by investigative journalist Brian Deer. It was Deer’s reporting in The Sunday Times and The BMJ that helped to debunk the 1998 study as fraught with ethical, financial and methodological impropriety. It was eventually found to have involved undisclosed conflicts of interest, and to have subjected minors to unwarranted procedures and mischaracterized their samples. Wakefield continues to defend his actions and conclusions.”",

Our modern day version of Algebra is actually closest to the from of it that they invented during the time period I am referencing.\n\nMy memory is a bit fuzzy on this since I learned about it a rather long time ago when studying history and haven't revisited it since, but there was someone that came to power in the Middle East sometime around the 1200's maybe (could be a little later though)? I can't recall this guy's name (it would be great if someone could help me fill in the blank here), but it was due to him being in power and essentially outlawing knowledge among the people that the Middle East turned away from all science and knowledge at the time. \n\nIf that mass exodus of scientific works and knowledge had never happened due to this man, there's a good chance that a lot of our modern day inventions from within the past few hundred years could have happened 4-500 years earlier. Think about that, can you imagine if the steam engine was invented and commoditized a couple to few hundred years earlier? That would've been roughly around the time of Christopher Columbus's life! It's hard to even imagine what the world would be like as a lot of our inventions within the past 100 years alone is something not many could even fathom or predict just a couple hundred hears ago. Our world would be such a different place had this man not come into power and did what he had done.\n\nThere was also an emperor of China that was doing exploration VIA sea, and at some point he eventually ended up closing their country off to the world- he basically banned it. I can't speak too much about the specifics of their developments and achievements at the time since they practically decided to cut themselves off from the rest of the world, but if they had continued their exploration, they could've been the one's who discovered America. \n\nSorry for the lack of names.

It's not because he was such a bad person. He was a very intelligent man who made several valuable inventions. Unfortunately, it later turned out that his inventions had some... extremely negative, long-term side-effects which we're still experiencing to this day.\n\nIn 1921, while working for General Motors, Midgley invented leaded gasoline. Leaded gasoline prevented a common problem with internal combustion engines that's known as \"knocking.\" Leaded gasoline was effective and relatively cheap, but unfortunately it quickly became apparent that spewing large amounts of lead into the air was also extremely unhealthy. Midgley himself suffered from lead poisoning and had trouble breathing, and it also caused the death of several GM employees. Nonetheless, leaded gasoline because popular all over the world and its use released incredible amounts of lead into the atmosphere. It only very recently became banned in most countries and remains in use in some countries to this day. The increased lead concentration in the Earth's atmosphere has been linked to a variety of modern health issues, including a rise in cognitive disorders and even an increase in violent crime in major cities.\n\nEven though Midgley never intended for any of this, it's probably enough to give Midgley a position on a list of most damaging individuals in human history. But unfortunately (both for Midgley and the entire world) that wasn't his only big invention. What was the other one? Well, Midgley still worked for General Motors (which you could argue is the real villain of the story, but we're looking at individuals here), but this time he was working on refrigeration. In the 1920s, refrigeration was still a rather hazardous technology since the chemicals used for it were toxic, flammable, and/or explosive. General Motors wanted to find a safer alternative, and in 1930 Midgley found it. His solution: Freon. Freon was highly volatile, but chemically inert, making it perfect for refrigeration. Freon and the group of chemicals like it known as CFCs also made their way into other products, like aerosol cans and asthma inhalers. Which was all good and well, but as many of you will probably realize, CFCs were later discovered to be the one of the biggest causes of the greenhouse effect, ozon depletion and the hole in the ozon layer, causing it to be phased out for most uses during the 1990s.\n\nWith these two inventions combined, it's been stated that Thomas Midgley Jr. had \"more impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history.\"",

The question itself is really bad because it assumes \"progress\" is an objective criterium and that humanity follows a well defined path towards a shared goal like the world was a big civ 6 game. It's not so simple. \nMany people are talking about important figures in religion and culture, but it is very important to make clear, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CULTURAL PROGRESS, culture and religion are a common human trait and are equally sophisticated all around. When you say this or that person hindered progress introducing some religion or opposing gay/women's/pagan/etc rights, you are only stating that  people who lived centuries or even millenia ago and had a totally different life stories experiences and backgrounds had a very different set of values than you. Ivy league students and papuan natives have languages,cultures and beliefs as sophisticated as each other. \"But We BUilD RoCkETs\" some may say. That is tecnological developement and though way more objective than cultural progress still is not very good at judging civilizations \"advancement\". Technology is as good as the problems it solves and necessity is a better way to measure advancement than an arbitrary path towards perfection. Also inventions don't happen in a vacuum, architecture is useless to nomads the same way animal husbandry thecnics are useless to suburban americans. Sometimes what people have is already good enough and they focus on other stuff other than an abstract betterment of human kind, like art, hobbies or their families. And least but not less, PEOPLE IN THE PAST DIDNT KNEW ABOUT THE FUTURE. Political and social situations are often way more important in the NOW. \n\nSome stupid stuff I've seen on this thread and a brief debunking:\n\n- a monk earased an Archimedes work to write prayers: a medieval monk valued prayers more than the modern redditor, really unexpected. Also the text was centuries old, any \"progress\" there was long accomplished by then \n\n\n- greeks invented the steam engine but abandoned it: it was invented as a curiosity and there was never any will to make it a big thing. Besides a steam engine would need a lot of other inventions to be really game changing. The same goes for the roman guy who invented flexible glass.\n\n\n- this or that person are responsible for the dark ages: there was no such thing as dark ages. It is a myth developed by people like the ones in this thread \n\n\n- this or that person is responsible for some religion: Again, people in the past had different priorities and at that time their beliefs were more important to them your modern sensibilities. Besides religion led to developement in other stuff like art and music\n\n\n- Anything related to the library of Alexandria: the library wasnt a magical place with all knowledge in the world. Much of it was poetry, literature and philosophy, most of it we wouldnt really care about if we had. Another large part was made of redundant histories of greece and rome. MOST STUFF THAT WAS REALLY GROUNDBREAKING WAS COPIED TO EXHAUSTION.",

(Which is actually quite bunk https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-malthus-is-still-wrong/# )\n\nIn large part his work was the primary influence for eugenics, forced sterilization, and genocide.\n\nHe suggested that the poor have their living areas decreased, less sanitary on purpose, so they would have increased chances of dying.\n\nA Christmas Carol, by Dickens is actually partially a refutation to the ideology. Scrooge rebuffs the Alms collectors by saying that if the poor cannot find workhouses then maybe they SHOULD perish, to decrease the surplus population.\n\nMalthus influenced Darwin to a degree. And later, economists that had read both men, started to apply 'Survival of the Fittest' to economics, leading to ideas like Social Darwinism and Laissez-faire Capitalism.",

That man deserved his spot in hell for what he did to those on the spectrum (like me with PDD NOS). For those who don’t know who he was, Hans Aspergers was an Austrian pediatrician, was said to have discovered Specific ASD’s (autism spectrum disorder and had one named after him)  and was falsely deemed a hero for years for saving children from Nazi killing programme. He actually was involved of the killing of children (he deemed to be unintelligent) with disabilities and encouraged therapies to bring these intelligent children back to normalcy that were often cruel and unusual. This led to many therapies and treatments for those on the spectrum to be set on turning these people normal to live in our society as well as ableism and cruel treatments to be normalized.  The foundational ideas of autism emerged in a society that strove for the opposite of diversity and encouraging neurodivergent people to be themselves.\n\nThere’s more that he did but as someone whose about to graduate college with a teaching degree, what Hans did to those children will never leave my mind. He reinforced ablest ideals to the point where they came the norm. It’s the ideals that many “fake” autism support groups encourage. It makes me sick. I will always treat my students with fairness regardless of what is happening in their lives or conditions they have.

A particular object of ire was his local dignitary's wife, an educated woman who spoke her mind and was just as adored and respected by the community as her husband, and Kramer? Oh he did not like that, oh no. He made it his goal to *destroy her.* He accused her of witchcraft, managed to succeed in getting a trial, and during his interrogation of her his actions were so reprehensible that even the current religious leaders at the time demoted him and told him to cut it out with the whole torture and prosecution of women thing, especially a popular noblewoman, it was just plain icky and making the church look bad.\n\nSo the guy goes and writes an immensely popular book about witches, pretty much as revenge for the church telling him to tone it down. The book goes on and on and ON about how independent women were despised by God, how unholy and evil all women were, spouts off about how women are the ones responsible for original sin, and spent a good deal of it describing how to torture a witch, which I'll remind you, to him a witch was pretty much anybody who was a woman. He then ended the book by lying and saying that he had the approval of the papacy to give himself credibility he did not have, but no one had Fact check back then so people just believed it wholesale. It became so popular that the papacy didn't dare contradict his claims, as they were too scared of public backlash.\n\nBecause of this guy's blind hatred of women, the witch trials became a thing, the Inquisition became a thing, religious fervour becoming the leading social power instead of science and rational thought became a thing, and disallowing women to practice medicine of any kind for hundreds of years became a thing.

This caught on quickly and the \"fat makes you fat\" mentality was embraced. He got data from a lot of countries around the world, but cherry picked only the data from the countries which supported his theory, omitting the rest in a blatant disregard for the scientific method. His research was cited by the FDA in official recommendations, and a hundred different fat substitutes started being pushed into foods- sugar being the most devastating one. Diabetes and obesity are at all time highs in the US after generations of sugar-fuelled diets and there are more and more studies linking brain diseases such as alzheimers and dementia to diet, specifically some of the many artificial fat substitutes that have been around.",

There are many scientific discoveries that created significant short-term \"progress\" for humanity but have been incredibly destructive to the long-term progress of humanity. Most notable being the combustible engine. An invention that have fueled industrial progress that culminated in the Anthropocene extinction event currently taking place. An event has the potential to destroy all of human progress. Additionally, there is the splitting of the atom. Massive potential for human progress  that has facilitated a nuclear reactor that is still currently melting down in the Pacific ocean as this is typed. An event that will also have \"global consequences\" so significant that the reports are still, a decade later, being suppressed by the powers that be. That's just two technological inventions which civic applications. Which doesn't even touch how these same technologies have been weaponized. \n\nIf you look at \"the progress of humanity\" using a different yard stick then the answer changes quite a bit.

A few honorable mentions: The Roman Empire, the Arab Slave Trade, Colonialial Europe and the estimated 40 million people (1/4 are children) currently living in neo-slavery in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.",

            "text": "There are so many good candidates. Off the top of my head, whichever emperor in China was responsible for stifling scientific inquiry, invention, and warfare in favor of memorizing the Analects and writing poetry. Remember when China invented all that important shit in antiquity, like the compass, papermaking, printing, gunpowder, and actual guns? And when they actually produced excellent military strategists like Sun Tzu? Can't remember which dynasty it was, but after that edict Chinese nobility basically agreed that soldiers and generals were worthless jocks, inventing useful things was a waste of time, and scientific research was a novelty at best. The former culture of mathematical rigor, scientific discovery, general creativity and technological innovation was completely discarded for what can only be described as foppish, softboi decadence. For something like half a millennia or more, Chinese noblemen grew their fingernails as long as possible to show they didn't have to do any manual labor and studied literature/wrote poems. The rest is history. They are only now catching back up with the rest of the world/innovating and becoming tech leaders in some fields. When you consider the sheer population of China, and how much it suffered at the hands of foreign oppressors, the Japanese, then the Communists because of this single imperial decision, and how backwards it was for so long, it's truly stunning and saddening. it held back the progress of literally billions of people for hundreds of years and indirectly led to the deaths of hundreds of millions of Chinese to actual genocide by various conquerors and would-be conquerors. Runner-up would be every Roman emperor from the 3rd century onwards, each of whom was corrupt and contributed to Rome's economic decline and its eventual downfall. This led to the Dark Ages. Enough said. The only reason the Dark Ages aren't #1 on this list is because the population of Europe at the time was a fraction of what China's population would become by the 20th century, so what happened in China held back more human beings/more human progress for significantly longer, as Europe had already recovered from the Dark Ages with the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution.",
