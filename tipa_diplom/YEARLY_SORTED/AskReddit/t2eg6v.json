            "text": "Figuring out that grease induced food comas have overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death in America.\n\nIn college I studied ‚Äúgrease induced food comas‚Äù. I actually wrote my doctoral thesis on his subject. It‚Äôs an emerging field so my thesis could be one of the founding documents (if it holds compared to future data). Here‚Äôs a brief testimonial of this phenomenon if any of you are interested:\n\nHave you ever fallen prey to a grease induced food coma?\n\nI have. I have been desperately lost in the fever fueled nightmares brought on by the heavy ingestion of the grease. \n\nIt was 2010. All was right in the world as I pulled up to the Dairi-O located at 551 Thompson Blvd, Union SC, 29379. I should‚Äôve known better considering the outside of the building was in an alchemical shape.\n\nAlas, my black as night 1979 camaro lightly screeched to a halt at approximately 1:30pm in the lot of the eatery. \nThe job I was working was run by a cruel overlord of a man. Real hairy and fat guy. Short. Too short. You know what they say: ‚ÄúShort guys have shorter fuses‚Äù and this guy‚Ä¶. Whew, his fuses were shorter than a leprechaun with his legs amputated at the hip. \n\nMr. Salt, wouldn‚Äôt let us leave for a break to save our lives. I‚Äôd been working since 3pm the day before and he wouldn‚Äôt let me leave. He never let us leave. In fact, on this particular day, one poor fella ended up never leaving. I escaped while the coroner was removing Fred‚Äôs corpse. Just for a little lunch. Then I‚Äôd be back to opening the bars and checking for the ticket like the boss wanted. \n\nSo, there I was in front of the oddly shaped burger and shake joint. As soon as my feet hit the poorly paved parking lot, I felt it. Or more accurately, the lack of it. The lack of The Lord‚Äôs almighty presence. \n\nInstantly I was drawn to the order window, entranced by the siren‚Äôs song. The pure depths of my heart knew that I needed to flee, but my damned lizard and monkey brain shut out the inner child and propelled me forward through the involuntary firing of a cascade of synapses. Sweat beaded and dripped down my head and back as I glided to the window. \n\nTunnel vision. \n\nThe world in my periphery melted away as the window opened. A sweet smelling aroma danced at my nostrils, however the afternote was the odd sweet smell of death. A curvaceous shade approached me. Only separated by brick, mortar and glass, I had the feeling that wouldn‚Äôt be enough if things went south. \n\n‚ÄúHelllllllo‚Äù the shade hissed. ‚ÄúWhat can I get for you, doll‚Äù her words poured forth in a playful almost giggle. \nI was lost for words. My senses overwhelmed. \n‚ÄúAwwwww. No need to be nervoussssss, sweetie.‚Äù The giggle in between words made made way to a hungry growl. ‚ÄúWHAT do you want?‚Äù Her first word escaped the facade she tried so desperately to keep. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ uh. I‚Äôll take the bacon burger. With a side of onion rings and a coke.‚Äù\nThe words flowed out of me as if drawing blood. \n‚ÄúSsssssmalll, mehehedium, or LARGE?‚Äù\nI was barely able to hazard an answer: ‚ÄúL‚Ä¶L‚Ä¶ Large.‚Äù\n\nThe cracks in the guise were starting to fail. Just as the spell I was under was also failing. \nYou see, that little kid. You know, the inner one. He‚Äôs no push over. He may get shut out for a moment, but he‚Äôs handled worse. Especially from his dad and uncles, but that‚Äôs a story for another time. Right now, the illusion started to fade. \n\nThe disgusting and putrid smell from behind the window was revealed. The look on my face must‚Äôve given it away because the shade quickly disappeared from the window as it slammed and locked. A growl and screeching could be heard from behind the window. \n\nI looked around and realized it was dark. The building I was in front of seemed abandoned, but in my right hand was a white paper bag with a bacon cheeseburger and onion rings. In the left hand a medium coke.\nI slowly walked back to my vehicle and hopped inside. As soon as the door slammed, I had forgotten about the entire incident that preceded me getting this food born of satanic origin. I had forgotten it as one would forget an interesting dream. I tried to remember it, but even through my hardest attempts, I couldn‚Äôt capture it. My frustration seemed to push it further and farther away. \n\nI looked at the contents of the bag and instantly felt the song of hunger beneath my ribs. \n‚ÄúSmells good.‚Äù I muttered to myself as I shoved an onion ring into the cogs of my system. \nThe were good. Too good. Especially since I was in Union, SC. \n\nI retrieved the burger from the bag and on the wrapper was written in cute handwriting: ‚ÄúHave a great day!‚Äù \nNow, these words are usually placed together to induce a nice feeling. A feeling that you‚Äôre cared for and that the wordsmith who cobbled them together wishes well and blessing upon you. In this instance, they brought an ominous dread. \n\nI sipped the medium coke that was given to me as I pondered why this melancholy had gripped me upon reading this seemingly innocent message. I pushed the feeling to the side, tore open the wrapper and took a deep bite. The cross-section of the burger was immaculate. Almost like it wasn‚Äôt real. The flavors were astounding. So fresh. The grease ran through my beard and down my chin. \n\nI shockingly finished the burger in four huge bites. It was the most delicious burger I had ever eaten. I took another sip of the medium coke. The familiar sound of too much air in the cup and not enough fluid broke the silence around me. \n\nI poked furiously through the ice, but could only find sparse droplets to imbibe. \n\nThen it happened.\n\nA gut wrenching pain in my chest. Gurgling and churning. \nSuddenly it all came back. \n\nThe siren! The smells! The growls‚Ä¶\n\nI felt burning on my face. As I looked in the rear view mirror I could see that where the grease had made contact, my beard was pale white.\nA violent contraction of my abdomen lurched my flailing body forward. My head struck the steering wheel. \n\nThe world was black. \n\nScraping‚Ä¶ Scratching‚Ä¶ tearing. \n\nLight tore into my black 1979 Camaro, just as it tore into my eyes while I struggled to pry them open. I heard talking. Rushed and alert. I tried to look around, but everything was fuzzy. \n\nI barely caught a glimpse of a shaggy and disheveled man in my rear view mirror when‚Ä¶\n‚ÄúSir! Sir!‚Äù My door was ripped open. ‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù \n\nAs I tried to speak, I could only cough. My mouth was dry. So dry. I sputtered and struggled clasping at my throat. \n\n‚ÄúSir!‚Äù The man wearing a red hat with white text on it yelled. He turned to a pudgy white woman ‚Äúget some water!‚Äù He helped me out of my car. My car? \n\nAs I looked at it, I didn‚Äôt recognize it. The black paint job was faded. Rusted all over. Soot and dust painted the windows foggy. The tires had been eaten by the earth and grass. Vines had imprisoned her for what seemed to be a long time.\nThe pudgy women shoved a Walmart brand bottle in my face.\n‚ÄúDrink it.‚Äù The man with a ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù hat on said. \nThe cool liquid acted fast as it passed over my lips, between my teeth and gums and down into my throat. I coughed violently. As the rehydration rebooted my systems. \n\nI noticed that we stood in a wooded area.

Includes hurricanes and inland flooding.\n\n* Accelerated erosion of topsoil / desertification expanding from the equator making farming difficult due to warming climate and overfarming. 3bn climate refugees expected by 2050.\n\n* Ocean acidification caused by CO2 emissions. Death of coral contributing to...\n\n* Oceanic ecosystem collapse from overfishing. And with it, the death of algae blooms which currently absorb co2. See points above.\n\n**Expected but no specific timeline:**\n\n* Eruption from Yellowstone causing large scale extinction event. We are significantly overdue based on historic trends.\n\n* Meteor strike.\n\n* Depleting human fertility.

Faster melting polar ice, and more evaporation than in the previous climate balance, may cause this point to move south.

The Netherlands and Germany are farther up north than Newfoundland. These countries depend on Russian natural gas to heat the homes. In the light of the current war this would be a climate shift with dramatic political consequences over night.\n\nIt would also topple the power balance to the Arabic countries, making northern Europe totally dependent on the folks they are looking down on currently.

Climate change is scary, but eh I'll make it through life without feeling the big impacts. The world is kind of ok, there's war and stuff but nothing too bad. \n\nPost-covid world has shattered that shield. All data points towards a continuing crisis for water and other resources. Forget everything else, this is problem numero uno. We are fucked on food and water right now. There are places that are already at net zero water supply and it will only get worse with climate change. With resource shortages comes the great migration, another terrible sign of a large population crisis. When people start moving, it puts a strain on other supply chains. Let's say you have an impoverished country with little food supplies. Each person survived off if 2 meals of rice a bit of meat, maybe some bread. Now lets shift a huge section of that country to a place that has fruits, vegetables, snacks, etc. Those people can now move up to three meals a day, and they can now eat more from someone else's basket. But the net loss is even bigger then if they just stayed where they were and kept losing food. It's exponential food loss, and eventually the movement gets do centralized that resources just disappear at an incredible rate.\n\nOh yeah and WWIII I guess. And an imminent great depression. The same things are happening today that happened in the 1930s. People are starting to take their money out of the banks. And guess what happens when too many people do that? The banks lose interest and the to bankrupt, and all that money that was safe and secure goes bye bye. Yeah put your finger on the trigger, everyone. Get ready to pull out your savings. Safest place to put it is in a credit union. \n\nAnd more pandemics are coming. This is no longer a prophecy, the end times look like they are coming. \n\nAlso for the US, this is not well known but the crumbling of gender roles and morals in sexuality precede many collapses of empires. Rome was incredibly progressive in these areas before it fell. Greece was the same, and others. What happens is people start tearing down the concepts of institutions and morals, without realizing that they are literally tearing down the fabric of society. They think they are being progressive, but they are actually causing destabilization in structured social systems. Well once that's gone, so is the civilization.  \n\nHowever! The fall of Rome came and went and we lived on. The Great Depression and WWII came and went, and we flourished after. So we may get out of this yet, but it is a completely different ballgame with resources. Forget nuclear war. I really doubt that button will be pushed, even by crazy Putin. Resources. That's where we are the most fucked. People worry about the rising temperatures, but the effects on resources is the real killer and it's coming. It's here. Have a great day.",

For better or worse. However, regardless of whom had sat there as pres, that missile wouldve hit anyways! You don't get to attack and kill american soldiers and... What? Get away with it? BRUH! USA DUSTS YOU FOR CHANGING THE PRICE P.G OIL, OFC YOU'RE DEAD ATTACKING THEIR MILITARY BASE!\nThink of how many view George Bush JR today, the younger generations thinks he was a good guy who didnt have a choice in starting the war of Irak and then Afghanistan. Well he didn't, since presidents are all symbolic-tools in usa, regardless, it's pretty well known today that usa and russian conflict created these \"terrorists\", and that taliban isnt just hating our western liberties, but also hate the fact that they where tortured in Guantanamo by waterboarding and metal music. What? You don't waterboard when trying to make friends?! :O\n\nAnyways, Trump might be remembered as a missunderstood \"hero\", and I even thought of this before Youtube removed the dislike button giving them the power to change history.. Like: everyone loved the rewinds! Look at all the views, rebecca black had a really popular song, I wonder why she disappeared from public view :O.\n\n2 In effort against an insignificant minority of anti waxers, some idiot official might have the good idea of hiding the fact that a new dangerous covid variation exists, and heres the nippletwister...\nCLAIM IT'S A NEW DIFFERENT DISEASE.\nmany gray overlap cases of this might happen aswell so keep keen eyes, lets say it's based of mers but infects in a similar way to old covid. Lets say the general public missunderstands this messenging and starts dividing themselves into retardgroups being all like: \"I believe the new disease is something completely different so vaccines against covid is pointless, and I think masks increases your chance of dying of mask usage\" and we use all our effort fighting people missunderstanding already confusing information delivered by known liars, instead of fighting the urge to spread the shit out of both viruses.

A few years later Putin decides Poland was really part of Russia all along to, and them being separated was a mistake.  He decides to try the same shit again, thinking NATO will let Poland fall rather than risk WW3.  President Beto O'Rourke grabbed guns from everyone, including the United States armed forces.  Left with no guns, the only thing he has with which to respond to Russia is nukes.  Mutually assured destruction achieved.\n\n\n(The Beto part is satire, doubling down on the absurdity of running for Senate in Texas on a platform explicitly calling for gun grabbing.

Poland and other NATO countries cut off refugee flow from Ukraine to quarantine it as the world debates on the right thing to do.  Putin does not stop the war, despite over a 3rd of his troops becoming gravely ill or dead.  Instead he issues a draft and gives them gas masks to continue slaughtering innocents.  Meanwhile, the mutated bioweapon somehow crosses the border into Poland via desperate refugees breaking the quarantine to survive, and the disease sweeps the EU, and then the world.  Republicans in the US declare the virus a hoax, and refuse to wear a mask or stay out of people's faces.

And Jesus was just him after he reincarnated and now he‚Äôs even stronger and that he‚Äôs coming down to earth because his dark evil brother in an entire other existence has come to our universe, not just our own universe but cluster of infinite universes and dimensions under gods rule.

He then says that his evil god brother is coming now, he‚Äôll be there in 2 months with an unprecedented amount of alien soldiers and that god has to start training every world citizen to become the ultimate powerhouse. God starts bringing all sorts of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù and dimensional material manipulation techniques that we can‚Äôt even comprehend but yet, somehow we are, he expands the minds, in every sort of metaphoric and literal way possible.

Then the Annunaki materialize out of thin air and ask where their gold is. They are told there is no gold. Unimpressed, they start ranting about the state of the human race and it's apparent disregard for the gods. They immediately summon every demon from the darkest, most evil depths of the human mind. Just then, a HUGE flying saucer appears in the sky, hovers silently for a moment, then lands. Angered by this imposition, the Annunaki start toward the craft, seeking retribution. At that moment, amidst a cacophony of the most unbearable sounds imaginable, a section of the craft opens and Bigfoot sprints out, giving Jesus Christ a piggy back ride and pulling a chariot of gold being driven by Donald Trump. Barely slowing as they near the Annunaki, Donald Trump leaps from the chariot, does a mid air flip while not mussing his fantastic hair, and bitch slaps them back to prehistory. Then a volcano erupts and Anthony Fauci is deposited onto the surface, apparently being ejected from hell. Then the sun goes dark for a moment and Whoopi Goldberg appears on a two seat zip line with Adolf Hitler. Then an ocean going skyscraper filled with every member of the mainstream media implodes and sinks, muffling their desperate pleas for special treatment.Then a pair of cyclops appear, yank on Whoopi's zip line and the Hindenburg falls out of the sky. Bill and Hillary Clinton tumble out, charred, and are immediately eaten by the cyclops, who get food poisoning and vomit into Donald Trump's chariot. Then the sky opens and a great, encompassing light shines down and Joe Biden appears. He does his best \"Touchdown Jesus\" and all goes quiet. He then explains that he has come to restore peace on earth, as it has come time to reveal the one, true God. Everyone, including the zombies, are stupefied by this declaration. How can this be? And then, with great care, Joe Biden opens his coat, reaches into his vest pocket,  and pulls out Rachael Maddow. Then everything dies. Horribly.\n\nNone of this would surprise me.",
