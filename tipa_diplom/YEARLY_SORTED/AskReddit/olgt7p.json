Next thing the priest asks the groom the classic “do you take thee” and the guy only goes and says the ex-partner’s name. Well the place collectively gasped.

THEN the bride turns up willing to give it another chance, sees the two of them and runs for the hills.

We fight, I still take a bus down there, after selling all of my belongings. He forgets to pick me up at the bus station. He got so drunk the night before with his roommates (army...ugh) that he slept through his alarm.

He gets hammered and ignores me the entire time. \n\nI find a place and put down the rent and deposit a week later. We wanted to just \"sign the paperwork and get it over with\", but a friend dragged us into the woods, in jeans and hoodies, and married us. (He had eye surgery recently, and decided, in a Norco haze, to get licensed to perform weddings). It was awful. \n\nHe cheated on me constantly, drank every weekend, and eventually every day. About a month before he deployed for the first time, we had an early Halloween party, because the guys wouldn't be home on Oct 31st. HD gets so drunk that he locks us in the room, climbs on top of me, and beats me until 3 men break down the door and rip him off of me. \n\nI stayed. Between low self esteem and being raised in a super strict catholic home, I was under the impression, from my family, that this was my fault somehow. \n\nI really tried. We had a kid, and he cheated on me throughout the whole pregnancy, and never stopped. I finally mustered the strength to leave after far too many years. \n\nHe's a full blown alcoholic now, and has wrecked 2 cars this year alone, drunk driving. He has little to nothing to do with his child, and still tries to call me to scream at me about circumstances that have nothing to do with me. \n\nMoral of the story: religion is bullshit.

The younger sister is in college, and the Maid of Honor.  The wedding was set for October 2020. For several months the MOH apparently had done nothing to plan anything. My mother chalks it up to her “being a college student.” So right off the bat my sister and fiancé are pissed that she is not doing anything the MOH is supposed to do. Then COVID started. My younger sister has to move home, take classes online, wearing a mask at work (Starbucks) and now can’t see her friends. And I guess she was having mental health problems prior to all that anyways. One day in May 2020 (actually MY wedding anniversary) I’m FaceTiming my father and the younger one pops in all excited and says “LOOK I CUT MY HAIR!!” She had COMPLETELY buzzed her entire hair off, after having mid back lengthed hair since she was a little girl. But it looked my she was enlisting in the army, but it was done in the dark. I look at her and was in shock, I didn’t know what to say. A few hours later my older sister says to get on Skype to a group video chat with my younger sister. My older sister and fiancé are looking into the camera like they are planning a murder. Needless to say this was a big deal. The following day my two sisters met and the older one had a long letter that she read to her saying how she is disappointed etc. A few months pass and the younger one says she will wear a wig. The older sister and fiancé agree. \n\nBy the end of the summer 2020 and they decide to move the wedding to October 2021 because of COVID. MOH still has apparently “done nothing”. But it’s clear she is keeping her short hair which has grown in now and she has it styled nicely. \n\nNow it’s 3 months until the wedding and the younger one is refusing to wear the wig (she never ordered one). But my sister and her fiancé are so adamant about her wearing one that my mother is calling me for advice of what they should do. The older sister and fiancé are complaining that everyone will have “down dos” except her (there way more to it than that - like the younger one always gets away with stuff without thinking of the consequences), while my mom says the younger one is not feeling loved for her being her. \n\nThese events have caused a whole rift in the family dynamic. My wife and I have nicknamed it HAIRGATE SCANDAL. My younger sister and the fiancé used to have a great relationship - like getting funny or meaningful gifts for Xmas. Now it’s awkward at best. \n\nOne hand we (edit: my parents, not we/me) want my younger sister to feel loved and appreciated, on the other hand it’s my sisters (edit: their daughters) WEDDING. \n\nLet’s see what happens…\n\nOh also the fiancé’s mom is requesting they change the wedding venue 3 months out!\n\nEdit: appreciate the feedback, I personally think it’s ridiculous to try to make someone wear a wig for any occasion.",

John please stop. Uncle Bob please go sit down.\" \n\nFinally, my friend's mom snaps out of it and gently removes Uncle Bob while Groom John is all, \"Why'd you have to do that!

            "text": "Talking about my exs new marriage. ( only reason why I care we have a daughter together.)\n\nI’m going to explain some history. Pandemic Halloween, rather than have our kids disappointed we decided to rent out a local theater (we rented it back in august) and show our own movie. We had the kids all dress up. Large popcorn and large drinks all come with the rental. I bought my daughter a beautiful dusty rose colored princess dress and matching heeled shoes (her first). (She was 4.) now I bought the dress and shoes for the explicitly stated reason so she can play dress up. I bought a dress that was too large.\n\nPandemic Christmas rolls around. (Not our week) We invite my daughter and my ex by extension to take Santa photos, at bass pro. My ex shows up with my daughter in her Halloween costume. I’m furious. It’s a costume. I mean if he told me he couldn’t get her a new dress i would have gotten her one! I smile and grit my teeth. I don’t want her to think I’m mad at her and I don’t want to ruin the pictures. We go out for ice cream after the pictures. \n\nThen my dad shows me a picture. (he snoops on fb) It a picture of a secret wedding involving my ex and a woman my husband and I were introduced to as “the new girlfriend” ( yeah that’s right no name just this is my new girlfriend)(apparently the wedding was two weeks after he introduced us to the new gf)(we still don’t know her name). Our daughter wore the Halloween costume dress to the wedding as their flower girl. They had the gall to buy my daughters slightly older cousin a dress in the same color. Like wtf? I’d think when you’re marrying you’d want to put space between you and your ex for the day. I think it’s sad. If he couldn’t afford to get her a new dress for either occasion my husband and I would have gotten one for her. It’s just weird and sad. \n\nThe reason why I bring those things up, is because we do phone calls on weeks that aren’t our week. Well on one of mine I asked my daughter if she ever plays dress up with her Halloween costume I bought her. She said no, but she wore it to daddy’s wedding. Everything in the background stopped. Like you know when in a movie someone new comes into town and a record scratches, it was one of those moments. Everything stopped. You could hear a pin drop. In a very angry voice we hear the new wife say to my ex, What. Does. She. Mean. By. She. Bought. The. Halloween. Costume! She. Wore. It. To. Our. Wedding! Then we heard a door slam. Lots of arguing. Another slammed door. (Some may say what I asked was shitty, it wasn’t. I wasn’t looking to cause problems. I’m not talking to them. I’m talking to my daughter. If they eves drop on our conversation and hear something they don’t like that’s on them. When her father calls she’s allowed to go into her room and talk to him in private, after I download him for the week.)\n\nI put maybe until the end of the year on their marriage. Between her anger issue and her overall obsession with her phone in general disinterested in my daughter I say a year.\n\n*I asked my daughter about the dress months after the secret wedding. I honestly didn’t think she’d respond with she wore it to his wedding.",

The happiest day of my life was when I heard that he was adamant about not having children. Praise be to the lordt, but then his wife got pregnant and now I'm an uncle, although I'll probably never actually meet the kid. I hope that kid can escape someday. \n\nI attended his wedding back in like 2016, which was the last time we ever spoke. I've been in the same room with him once or twice since then, but we make a concerted effort to avoid each other. We have always hated each other, and Tbh I don't even know why I was invited to his wedding or why I went. Anyway, despite the fact I wouldn't shed a single tear if he died, I promised myself to screw in my Miss America smile for the duration of the event, to be helpful in setting up the reception, to help with cleaning, I worked the bar for a little bit, did coat check, I cried three times (all fake, but very convincing) during the service. I get an A++ for my behavior, and I made a pact with the devil to not get loose-lips-Linda once I got buzzed and start talking shit, BUT BOY DID THEY TRY.  \n\nthree or four times during the night his new wife approached me, completely wasted (she was like 95lbs soaking wet, was on a handful of anxiety meds and just smashing the wine) and would start crying and ask me why I don't talk to my brother. I just smiled and shrugged, and said I dunno and asked her if she needed me to help her with anything - change the subject super quick.  \n\nBy the end of the night her bridesmaids were fighting over who got to hold her hair while she prayed to the porcelain goddess, there was broken glass and spilled drinks all around the bridal party's section and my brother and his boys were like, just being standoffish and boring. No one was smiling. My poor mother was crying in the corner because my SIL's family are all millionaires and we grew up other side of the tracks, so I think he was a bit embarrassed of us and kept us in the back. only 5 people from his side of the family and 95 from hers.  \n\nIt was just the fact that this fucking woman was trying to get me to talk shit about my brother to her at his own wedding. I'd also heard she got caught texting her ex boyfriends and was seen making out with another dude shortly before they got engaged (Which is probably what spurned the rush to the altar). I hate my bro but there are lines you don't cross and I would not be held responsible. The wedding sucked. I had a lot of fun, but I'm smelling a divorce in their future any day now. I hear they're both in therapy and counselling and I mostly just feel bad for their new kid.",

(our family was somewhat poor so we couldn't afford security). anyway this other guy blew some kind of glitter which woke alot of the guests up. then everyone started dancing it was bloody mental!!! \n\nSometime after the bride ran out and this guy followed her. I saw the red trenchcoat guy talking to my uncle and he went past me dragging my uncle outside (the man in red looked angry). so i followed. when we got outside dude! the bride was snogging this random guy. like wtf! anyway we all went on the lawn and the guy in red got swapped with my uncle?? idk how but it was magical. we all went and there were people breathing fire and stuff. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntbh in the end. bangin weddin id say 10/10",

Cousin was pretty cool and his now-wife was his childhood friend whom he dated for something like 13 years I guess. Typical young love story. \n\nAnyway, as the reception was winding down, I was invited to go bar hopping with them and their crew, which I agreed to. We were going in a party bus. My little brother wasn't of legal age so he was going to split with other friends to their place. As we are discussing the game plan, the bride approaches me, very drunk, and thanks me for attending the wedding. I tell her it was a good time and that I'm glad I came. She gives me a hug and whispers to me that she's glad I did too and for being the only one she could talk to tonight (which I have no idea what she said for, as we only talked generally in a group of people earlier) and she starts getting very suggestive towards me. Wasn't sure how to respond to it so I said I needed to go to the bathroom and get on the party bus. I've yet still to ask my little brother if he overheard our interaction, since the memory isn't too clear as I had been drinking a hefty amount by this point. \n\nWe get on the party bus and head downtown, the streets are completely packed with people and she gets a lot of congratulatory cheers from people all around. The strange thing was that my cousin and his bride didn't even acknowledge one another much at all during our night out. Not sure why this might've been, but I'm guessing one of them might have had a bit too much to drink and the other wasn't too accepting of it. I dunno. \n\nWedding was nice, I'm not really into that kinda stuff though. I generally think it's a waste of money, and all these traditions are rather self-centered and convoluted. I am very cynical of relationships to begin with, so I tend to think a wedding in general is a big red flag that a couple won't last, haha. But that's just me.",

It made sense because sex before marriage was a huge tabboo, because kids born out of wedlock were doomed. None of that is true anymore. The whole idea of trapping someone in a relationship seems creepy to me, and also kinda pointless, because divorce is so common. People are not property, anymore, and it would serve us well to remember that.\n\nInstead of a wedding, why not do an annual recommittment ceremony, where the presumption is that the couple will split up unless they both still want to opt in to the relationship for another year. Then you can have a party to celebrate how much you have loved/enjoyed one another, and reminisce over the good times, before reaffirming the relationship, or parting ways. I feel like this would promote respect, and do away with most of the unrealistic expectations (sense of entitlement) that winds up ruining most marriages.

They were way too young, moved way too fast (like dated a year then marriage), and seemed way too perfect (both ridiculously hot, also both acted way too kind, were the epitome of Southern Baptist hospitality, and way too performative- like way too lovey dovey even for a couple). It felt very... artificial.\n\nThat's not what tipped me off at the time. \n\nThey walked out to the song \"I'm Walking on Sunshine.\" Groom picked up the bride and carried her out. As soon as I heard the song, as soon as I saw the groom lift her up, I had a terrible gut feeling, right there at the wedding. I didn't know why at the time, but in hindsight I genuinely do not think I've ever heard I'm Walking on Sunshine played in non ironic settings outside of radio. As if the song was begging for bad luck. \n\nAs an adult that has better insight than past me did, I think I was also subtly picking up small hints I'd noticed in other relationships like theirs, like how performative their public displays of affection were, the very stereotypical \"song\" they apparently had that was \"their song,\" etc. Makes sense after all of my life watching so many of my family members go through first, second, and third marriages like they were going out of style.\n\nI had the gut feeling for a while but kept quiet because really, I am pessimistic as hell and assume the worst in everything as a defense mechanism, and I didn't want to literally break up a marriage over a song, so I didn't. I didn't really believe in love at the time, but because they seemed like really sweet people, I really wanted it to work, so I wrote it off and kept it to myself, kept up a nice smile and buried it deep inside. Went to their reception, things were okay, groom threw the garter and I caught it, it all seemed fine.\n\nTurns out my gut feeling was right because they eventually got divorced, I think a week or two later? Maybe longer, not sure, it's almost been a decade. Apparently he cheated on her after getting drunk at a party. To make matters worse, she was pregnant with his child. Any time the song came on the radio, my friends and I kinda winced and changed it. \n\nObviously the moral is \"don't get married so quickly and so young\", but I think the song picked definitely was a subtle hint to their mindsets at the time, and again, I'm Walking on Sunshine? That's asking for bad luck",

But she was. they were both going to enlist as soon as they were married, so.... They had to get married? I won't pretend to understand.\n\nAnyway, she was graduating in late May, wedding was scheduled for early June. In early April, they had a huge blow up and broke up. Not particularly unusual, they usually did this every couple months, so they kept the wedding date just in case.\n\nWell, apparently 2 weeks after they broke up, GF had a new boyfriend, so 2 weeks after that my friend had a new girlfriend.\n\nMy friend and the new girlfriend kept the wedding date and got married then. A week after her graduation, a month after meeting and 3 months shy of her 18th birthday (I don't know why, but parents agreed).\n\nHOWEVER, it was a really small wedding and reception. Think, wedding party total of 8 people including bride and groom and 15 guests total. Most of the guests (myself included) were not aware of the bride switcheroo until the new bride came in. They thought there might problems if they told people ahead of time.\n\nI got the whole story from a groomsman at the reception.

            "text": "\nMy own wedding. \n\nBack story: I knew I would love her forever within a year of us dating. She said she felt the same. From the start we’ve been incredibly good at communicating, especially when it comes to uncomfortable conversations. My parents divorced when I was a toddler and remarried several times each. I told her I would only ever marry once and I wanted to be absolutely certain it would last. She said she didn’t mind waiting until I was ready. It took me 8 years to propose and then we took a year to plan….\n\nCut to the wedding and I’m watching her walk down the aisle. The past nine years flash through my memory like people describe when they’re dying, and I realize that the reason I had to wait so long is because I never truly felt like I was good enough for her. \n\nI was right. I’d been incredibly shitty to her, tried so hard to push her away, to test her dedication to me. I was always ready for the day she’d had enough and decided to find happiness elsewhere. And in that half minute watching her walk toward me I have all of these memories stitched together, wrapping around and smothering me in a quilt of shame. I’m absolutely dumbfounded that she’d put up with my bullshit, my emotional abuse, for the better part of a decade—almost a third of her life. \n\nI take my time to chew on every word of our vows, to really listen to myself say those words. I know I don’t deserve to have this chance, but I choose to accept what I don’t deserve. \n\nCan confirm, it’s true that people change once they get married. I’ve become someone who takes care to be responsible with the treasure he did not earn, and I no longer feel guilty for having it. I still don’t know how long our marriage will last, and I don’t think it’s guaranteed to last forever. But I’ll never marry again, and I work every day to make myself as indispensable to her as she has been for me. \n\nTo be brutally honest, I’ve allowed her to guide me toward being the man I always wished I could be. She’s allowed me to chip away at her insecurities and reveal the warrior she was always ashamed to be. \n\nI have hope that our paths will never diverge, but my parents taught me all too well that a single choice can change everything. I have a daily reminder set on my phone: Don’t fuck up today.",

The table next to me was filled with 20 of my closest relatives.   Directly in front of me was the groom/bride table with 2 tables on either side for the immediate family of the groom/bride.    \nIt was quite a drive to the wedding (3+ hours) and my hunting buddies were all in their 70s.   None of them came.  \n\nNow, my brother and I were very close.   I am also close with the 20+ family members that flew in and sat at the table beside me.   \n\nAt the reception as I looked around I noticed that  my date and myself were at this HUGE table alone.   My brother’s “immediate family” table for “honored guests” had two empty seats.  It was only occupied by my parents and my rich aunt and uncle that gave the couple $5,000 as a wedding gift.   (A rich uncle that the bride had never met and that my brother and I only spoke to every few years at family reunions. Not to say that he didn’t love my uncle our lives are just in different states and we were all very busy).\nI approached my brother and asked if I could sit with my parents and aunt and uncle since none of “our” hunting friends showed.  (They were his friends as well but I still lived in town with them and saw them at least once a week for breakfast or lunch or dinner because they were good friends of mine through my father).\n\nI should also point out that my brother is my best friend. We have a very good relationship. We lived together for 27 years until he moved out to move in with his fiancé for the year prior to the wedding.\n\nNaturally, my brother said I could sit with my aunt and uncle and my parents and he didn’t know who did the seating arrangements but he didn’t really understand why I wasn’t placed there to begin with.\n\nHis wife Got a really sour look on her face leaned into a whisper into his ear and then told me no.\nMy feelings were so genuinely hurt that my brother didn’t stand up to her but I decided, “ hey this is their wedding. Don’t make it about yourself. Suck up your feelings and maybe discuss it calmly with your brother at a later date as to not ruin his special day.”\n\n\nEventually I told my mom that the succubus my brother married I was probably going to leave him within a year or two because she was a type-A personality with OCD and the type of woman who marries a man and expects him to magically change after the wedding to be everything she wants and needs.  My brother is awesome.  He is way better than her.\n\n\n10 months later my brother came to my house for Easter Sunday and told me that he had been living alone for three months because his wife left him.   He was protecting her by not telling the family that they were living separately and having hard times because he kept hoping they’d get back together and he didn’t want to taint our opinions of her.\n\n\nI knew the moment that she disrespected his family that she wasn’t gonna last.\n\nI don’t hold grudges against anyone who’s ever done me wrong in this life. I usually forgive and move on.\n\n\nAs close as I am to be capable of hating somebody is how I feel about her.  She broke my brothers heart and I sincerely hope she regrets it every day for the rest of her life. I know she won’t because she’s a horrible person but I really wish her a lot of discomfort over her actions.",

Three weeks later she posts that they’re *ring shopping*. About this time is when she starts bailing on commitments to her friends, becoming less and less available in friend group chats…she always has some excuse why she can’t meet up or hang out. Even when she’s bailing last minute on her friend’s bachelor party (that she planned). Three months after they meet and start dating she posts that she and new BF are now engaged. None of her friends have met him still. Res flags, alarm bells, fucking sirens are going off to us. She sees none of them. \n\nThree months after that she posts that they snuck off and got married. A full six months after they met. None of her friends have met him still. And she’s still suddenly just not available for her friends. Instead of going to get her PhD in history or literature, she’s filtering through part time job after part time job at coffee shops, banks…\n\nFrom the perspective of her friends…it looks fishy. It looks like she’s met some small town “good ole boy” who is isolating her from her friends and support while also rushing her into a marriage. She’s never been in a serious relationship and grew up very sheltered. It’s just…worrisome. She’s naive and easily manipulated. \n\nI mean…if a new partner wanted to go ring shopping after three weeks I’d fucking run. But this girl is naive and thinks she lives in a fucking Jane Austen novel\n\nSo I’m betting either the marriage fizzles out when the excitement wears off or she realizes years down the road *after* having kids and settling in that she’s made a mistake. She has no means to support herself independently either so…ugh it just worries me.\n\nEdit: For everyone saying there is no guy - she’s posted photos with him and her family has met the dude. There are wedding photos with both families pictured. Comments from both families on these posts to socials. Fucking Reddit detectives…",

This had prompted the pair to spend borderline-absurd amounts of money on what might very well have been the tackiest celebration I've ever seen.\n\nImagine renting out the cafeteria at an elementary school, then hiring a celebrity (who happens to be a half-blind orangutan) to decorate it. Commission the services of an expensive caterer, but require them to serve only the sort of slop that you'd find at a low-rent county faire, citing the fact that \"nobody likes fancy crap.\" Finally, enlist a disc jockey whose idea of an appropriate \"first dance\" song is \"Freaks of the Industry\" by Digital Underground.\n\nI'm exaggerating, obviously, but that really was the song that they chose.\n\nNow, everyone has different tastes, and it might seem reasonable to assume that the newlyweds were getting exactly what they wanted. That was what I had been telling myself, anyway... until shortly before the \"money dance\" (the announcement of which was the first time that I'd ever even heard of the tradition), when I overheard a suggestive piece of gossip: The couple had apparently already argued about the amount that had been spent on the reception, with the bride claiming that the whole thing was a disaster, and the groom insisting that it was \"classy as fuck.\"\n\nHe had been so certain of this, in fact, that he had used his new wife's credit card to pay for it.\n\nShe had reportedly been rather upset when she'd found out about that, and had temporarily kicked him out of the house... which had prompted him to stay with an old girlfriend. *Something* untoward had allegedly occurred during the man's exile, but details were lacking, and his spouse had decided to forgive him. That was already bad enough, but the the rumor – at least as I understood it – was that the aforementioned \"money dance\" was supposed to help them recoup their financial losses, with the implication being that the future of their marriage was riding on them receiving upwards of thirty thousand dollars in a four-minute period.\n\nAs I considered all of this, and as I mentally added up the amounts being pinned to each partner, I found myself thinking \"Yeah, this isn't going to last.\"\n\n**TL;DR: Grifting groom gets grabby, gormlessly gambles gaiety.**",

I  showed up to his bachelor party without knowing anyone else and only having the number of the best man. I was several hours behind everyone else as I was travelling there from some distance.

The entire time he kept looking at the door and whenever it opened and someone came out, he quickly moved his hand holding the cigarette behind his back, because he thought it was her. It was like he was deathly scared of her and not like in a playful way.\n\nIt didn't surprise me when about a year later they got divorced. Apparently, she just kind of was taking advantage of him, staying home all day (she didn't work) spending thousands of dollars ordering clothes and shoes online using his money and credit cards she took out in their names.",

My husband and I looked at each other then and made a face because that was SO not her. And not their relationship in general. If she was saying that in front of a crowd because of the pressure from his family.... we didn't want to think negatively, but we hoped our gut feelings were wrong lol. \n\n\n\nThe couple ended up moving so husband could go to med school...... and they lived with his family for about a year in a state the wife had no friends or family or job in. His family was downright nasty to her. He was so busy with med school she was left alone with them. It was a shitty situation for her and I really feel for her. She reacted poorly herself and ended up being openly hostile to them and to her husband when he wouldn't agree to move back to where she wanted to live and they got divorced after around 4 years. His grandma texted him when she heard the news something like \"good, we knew you would come to your senses.\"\n\nNow her husband is remarried to a \"more christian\" girl who his family likes.

I'm a first gen filipina-american, and within my mom's friend group I have witnessed a depressing amount of spousal abuse on different levels. But there's one memory that sticks out over the rest. \n\nMy mom had this lovely friend named A. She had come to the US alone and was working at an assisted living center to support her children back in the PI. She was vivacious and a born performer and I thought she was one of the most amazing women in the world. Her ex-husband in the Philippines was apparently a deadbeat and she had been disowned by her parents for working as a night club singer in her late teens. She paid money to an aunt to take care of her kids, and her greatest dream was to be able to bring her children to live with her in the US.\n\nShe met a guy at work named Stewart (I don't feel bad naming him because he's a terrible shit). He seemed really supportive of her and talked about wanting to bring \"their kids\" to live with them. A got pregnant and she and Stewart made plans to get married. I was a flower girl in the wedding and the incident in question happened during the rehearsal dinner. \n\nThe dinner was at a rented clubhouse in their condo community instead of a restaurant, and rather than catering, A and her friends (including my mom) cooked traditional Filipino food while Stewart got drunk with his friends and family. I also remember that the wedding was extremely unbalanced, maybe 20 percent A and 80 percent Stewart, and literally ALL the Filipinos were in the kitchen. I was only 7 or 8 at the time, so I didn't really understand the situation fully. \n\nI spent most of my time between the kitchen with my mom or hanging out with other kids around the pool. Later, I went back into the kitchen and went to use the staff bathroom off the back. But I didn't choose the right door--I went into the pantry instead. I opened the door right as Stewart pushed pregnant A into the shelves. He grabbed her wrists and held them above her head and was just about to grab her neck with his left hand when he realized I was there. Everything in the kitchen was at a standstill. My parents argue like cats and dogs, but before that I had never seen another person physically assaulted. I don't remember much from that night after that point.\n\nThe next day, I remember A crying under her veil as we waited in the back of the church. I had never seen her like that before. It was the start of a miserable 4 years. To this day, at the age of 32, I still don't know how she was able to go through with it. Maybe it was because they worked together? She was pregnant with his kid? I think she must have felt like she had no other option.\n\nThere is a kind of happy ending for A. She later met this kind older man named B. He actually made good on his promise and helped bring all her children to live with them at a beautiful ranch he had built. Things were really happy for 2 years, until A's youngest--the child she had with Stewart--was diagnosed with brain cancer and passed away before her 7th birthday. Still, B was the best person to be there for her during that time. Stewart did not come to his daughter's funeral.",

            "text": "Oh ... the \"costume wedding.\" I've never publicly shared this story before.\n\nI was ordained into the [Universal Life Church](https://www.ulc.org/) back in September, 1990. That was back when you had to do it the hard way, by sending in a postcard saying you wanted to be ordained. None of this \"fill out an online form\" crap.\n\nSo after completing some more paperwork, I wound up being legally allowed to perform weddings in Oregon. My first was for a good friend, and several others were for [when Multnomah county briefly allowed same-sex weddings in 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Oregon). However, I generally avoided weddings unless I really felt it was important for me to be there.\n\nI broke this rule about 20 years ago. I won't explain why, but suffice it to say that I agreed to perform an October wedding for a couple I didn't know, but a good friend told me they needed a minister. They wanted a non-religious wedding at their house. I said \"yes.\"\n\nThe next several weeks involved me trying to get them to meet me for a rehearsal, but they always had a reason they couldn't meet. Further, when I asked about their vows, they simply asked me to \"write something.\"\n\nOK. I've done this before. I can do this.\n\nThe day of the wedding, they still hadn't met me, except for phone conversations. My friend drove me to their place—an old house out in the middle of nowhere—and explained that it was a \"costume wedding\" because it was almost Halloween. So as we drove into their yard, complete with a rusting, broken-down pickup truck, I noticed they tried to hang \"ghosts\" in their trees, made from white trash bags. It looked like a bunch of Klan hoods hanging from their trees.\n\nAs I entered the place, I was introduced to \"Pocahontas\", a very underage girl dressed in an outfit that, um, clearly revealed she wasn't wearing a bra, but desperately needed one. I'll not say more, but I was not comfortable.\n\nI was surrounded by vampires, cowboys, and all manner of curious folk. I had a nice grey suit, complete with clerical collar, and everyone straightened up when I approached, seeing as to how I was the minister. I smiled and nodded. That was the part I was there to play.\n\nI was introduced to the bride, as she was getting dressed, but she had no time for me. I explained that because we hadn't met, I still needed her and the groom to practice their vows, at least once.\n\nNo. No time, she explained. She was half-naked. I didn't argue.\n\nI came prepared. I've done this before. I'm not a _complete_ idiot. So as everyone gathered for the ceremony, I met the bride and groom and handed each of them a piece of paper with their vows highlighted. I explained that I would start and then prompt them to read their portions of the highlighted vows.\n\nUnderage Pocahontas with her breasts hanging out was bouncing up and down next to us. I was not happy, but I smiled. Dressed in a nice suit with a clerical collar, I was the only \"normal\" person there and I'll be damned if I'm going to ruin their big day.\n\nWhen the ceremony started, I started my bit ... and promptly forgot their names. So I referred to them as the \"bride\" and \"groom\", hoping that everyone was drunk enough to not notice (they apparently were drunk enough).\n\nAnd then I started the vows. When it came time for the groom to read his part, he hesitated. I tried to discreetly point to his vows on the paper and he started reading, but that's when I realized he was functionally illiterate. That's when everyone in the audience learned he was functionally illiterate.\n\nIt is difficult to convey just how emotionally charged this situation was, with a huge crowd of drunken cowboys, werewolves, superheroes, and so on, standing there holding beer bottles, cans of beer, or little red plastic cups of wine, listening to the groom trying to sound out the words on a piece of paper. They were realizing for the first time that the bride is marrying someone who cannot read. I had publicly humiliated the groom and he refused to look up from the paper when he finished. I ad-libbed a shorter version of the vows so that he wouldn't have to read more. I will never forget the horror of that moment.\n\nDespite all of this, we managed to stumble through to \"I now pronounce you husband and wife.\" And because we hadn't rehearsed and I was making this up as I went, I didn't know what to do next. No one knew to what to do next. A hideously awkward silence descended on what should have been the happiest moment of their lives. And so everyone looked at me, as the minister, for guidance. Panicking, I said, in a loud voice, \"and now it's time for a question and answer session.\" I turned them towards the crowd and stepped back after some brave soul asked the first question. It went surprisingly well and the questions fired fast and thick as I slipped towards the kitchen to get away from the mess.\n\nI discovered, to my surprise, that it was a BYOB (bring your own beer) wedding. They were kind enough to hand me a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon.\n\nMy friend and I retired to the back porch during the celebration and discreetly made a bet about how long the marriage would last. Then the back door burst open. An angel in white robes, with large wings and a cigarette dangling from her lips stormed out, cussing up a storm.\n\nI immediately fell back to my \"minister\" role and asked \"what's troubling you on this beautiful day, sister?\"\n\n\"My sister married an asshole!\"\n\nWe drove home in silence and I vowed never again to perform a wedding for people I didn't know (I broke the rule for the same-sex weddings mentioned above). Years later, I found out that while the wife was giving birth, the husband was having sex with his girlfriend.",

            "text": "Back when I did a lot of wedding videography. I’ve kept this one to myself for years. I think only my IRL friends know about this. \n\nI got to be a pretty high roller in the wedding industry by staying consistent & getting my company on a SHIT TON of “vendor lists”. I had 10 years filming/editing experience going into the industry. I thought being in the wedding industry as a videographer sounds cool, but it’s just about (if not more) degrading as getting bitched at working in some fast food/retail business. It’s essentially customer service, for something that has no re-dos. Lots of bridezillas, angry moms, and the occasional crazy fucking groomzilla. \n\nSo bottom line; you deal with a lot of shit. But you also *see* a lot of crazy shit that makes you thankful that *your* flaming garbage barge of a life isn’t as big of a bag of dicks & the total shit show you’re witnessing. \n\nThe extreme standard is the “toast profession of love towards bride or groom” or just anytime in the day in general. Usually from best man or MoH. Others are drunken rants, runaway brides, etc. you get to hear some wild stories. \n\nThis example isn’t as extreme as some. But after a while you can really start to “read people” on wedding days. \n\nA standard procedure was the couple opting in to “interviewing”, asking the bride and groom about their wedding day. Remember couples need to PAY for this service additionally, so you’d assume people would give a shit about what they say. \n\nAs far as the interview went. It was mostly to fetch your generic background “I love them so much” audio. Pretty standard questions; “how did you meet?” “what does today mean to you?” “How do you think, blah blah blah” \n\nOver 4 years in that industry and I’ve grown to despise it. Everything is almost the same, except for those random 1 in 30 weddings with something different and fun, but I digress. This was during my first year when I was still a bright eyed, ignorant to the world, and full of hope to make the “next viral wedding video” in my mind. This day was what really started to decline the industry for me. \n\nProbably the worst wedding I’ve ever shot, was this groom that was acting like he didn’t want to be there. I got into his “interview” and chatted with him for a minute before turning on the camera/mic just to make them a bit comfortable with me. I tell them “please restate my answers, and answer in full. In editing I will be removing my voice so it’s only you speaking. \n\nWhen I asked him “how did you meet” he replied “a baseball game” \n\nI stopped for a second.. waited for more. Then he said “what’s your next question” I asked him again to restate the question and answer in full sentences. Then I asked “what’s your favorite thing about her?” He responds \n\n“Probably her hair” and I stopped and waited for more again… I asked him if he wanted to continue the interview since he didn’t seem fully comfortable with me & I wasn’t getting any usable material/audio out of him. I was basically feeling like I was wasting my time when I could be elsewhere getting material. Generally I just cut the interview off if people don’t want to speak with me.. He reiterated that he was feeling fine, and was just answering my questions. \n\nSo I said “okay… what are you looking forward to the most with marriage” The only full answer I got from him that day was this\n\n“Honestly, I live alone right now. So it seemed really beneficial to have someone else around. I’m looking forward to her cooking & doing my laundry. Haha, actually just kidding can you cut this out?” \n\nI felt like my mouth was just wide open at that point. Half of me wanted to ask this guy if he was even in love with this girl. I felt so bad for her, she was the SWEETEST person, and he just didn’t even seem to give two shots about her. I got home, deleted that entire interview and told her we didn’t have time. I didn’t have the heart to show her what he said, in hindsight I wish I had left it in. I’m pretty sure that couple got divorced about 6 months later too, when she actually did come asking about those interviews. So I’m pretty sure something was up from the get go. \n\nThe actual worst is celebrity marriages though. Are you ready to have every single bit of your videography career experience tossed out the window? Not to mention being treated like an actual meat puppet that is holding a camera for the first time ever and the famous couple clearly knows all the ins and outs of what makes a perfect video, so you’re at their whim all day. Then you get  a whopping 10 whole minutes for couple photos they were barely interested in taking? Just to have their celeb friends instagramming/Tik tok’ing literally over your shoulder, getting in shots, interrupting for selfies, and yelling loudly during that time. It’s just insane how high of an expectation you’re held to on a NORMAL wedding day, let alone some egotistical celeb couple. You have not even a SLIVER for margin or error. But don’t worry you’ll likely be emailed back that you missed something that happened at a totally unrelated time to the timeline you were given, and the coordinator never told you? \n\nFucking “awesome” industry. If you want to be a manager of some sort or simply grow a massive spine. 10/10 get your ass kicked, go through the ringer and come out stronger in the end. My first grey hairs popped up while I was in that industry full time. In hindsight, that did wonders for my career, but never fucking again unless I second shoot. You end up with some WILD stories that are HILARIOUS down the line. \n\nEDIT: As an added bonus I actually was a second shooter recently, as I just wanted to make a quick easy side buck. Friend needed help, I said yes. \n\nThere was a brother to the groom who got INSANELY drunk this wedding. Like I showed up at 11am and this dude was trashed. He proceeded to disappear a TON during the day. Groomsman photos, individual photos, group photos, and shit even the CEREMONY got delayed because this guy was just mysteriously gone. He got up to give a toast, went on a 15 minute political rant about how trump won, then proceeded to tell his parents he loved them. It was EERILY quiet, and then he told him brother he loved him, and went on to cry about how much their lives together meant to him. It sounded more like a suicide note than a speech.. after which, I went outside to take a short mental break and take my typical “well wow that fucking happened” peace and quiet moment. The dude crept up beside me, like REAL close, and in the most slurred speech and completely cross eyed he asks me “was my speech good, did I do okay???” \n\nI was like “yeah.. it was good..” He stared at me completely blank for about 4 seconds, and then said “you wouldn’t lie to me would you?” More silence… followed by me gulping, and more silence. Took a drink of water and I walked the fuck away. Absolute big ol fucking nope. Dude gave off serial killer vibes. \n\nThe later bride approached us, and told us to take that out of their video period. They did not want that to be remembered by family & their kids. . A few weeks later, my buddy messaged me and said “the bride wanted that video of the brother individually so they could sit down and talk to him”. Turns out this guy was a raging alcoholic who was trying to convince the bride to marry him instead, this is part of where he was sneaking away to. They had found an empty bottle of jack that was given to the groom as a present in his backpack he stole the night before. and lots of empty single shots of crown. He was drinking during the entire reception too. Came to find out that he had nearly killed someone the year before because of his 3RD DUI. \n\nPEOPLE MAN",

He was nice but quiet. \n\n\nDay before wedding the bride, a long time friend, asked me to help babysit one of the groomsmen because he was a nightmare. Asked me, other bridesmaid, DJ, the works to help cut him off from alcohol before the ceremony, not to allow him to make a speech, keep him from hitting on girls, the works. He was an alcoholic douche with 6 kids and 2 DUIs but was the absolute best friend of the groom. Day of the wedding, best douche breaks into the bar, gets hammered, has to be dragged down the aisle, gets the florist drunk while they pretty much have sex on the dancefloor, and makes what I can only assume to be a speech during the father/daughter dance. \n\n\nThe bride was pissed and stressed as well trying to get things to not be a total shit show. Groom blocked us from keeping him in check, wanted us to just let it go while he did everything the bride asked he not do. It was like a weird purposeful or intentional self sabotage thing. Douche also broke into the groom's private stash of homemade mead he'd made special just for the wedding, stripped his clothes, and ran through the parking lot hiding in bushes at 11 p.m...\n\n\nSame night the couple text me asking if I'd want to be their third in their open relationship, which I find out later was mostly the groom's idea. I also found out later they got married pretty quickly because she suddenly needed medical benefits all the while he had been asking for an open relationship for the complete duration of them being together but she'd only acquiesce if he would marry her as well. Divorce finalized a year and a half later.\n\nEdit to add: No I did not join them, don't shit where you eat. And no, stop asking if I'm x or y person. Some of y'all have apparently lived through VERY similar situations apparently but stop asking if you know me.

I'd never danced (not even at a club), but was willing to take lessons with her with the understanding we would do something together so she could have her dream wedding. I sucked, but got through a few lessons of slow dancing. I can now awkwardly shuffle around, but don't expect anything crazy. The dance school wouldn't choreograph anything for us, so she promptly gave up.\n\nWhen it came to choosing the song, she decided she wanted 'I Want You To' by Weezer (my favourite band and the song had just come out recently), which has like a jamboree feel to it. It is not a slow song to slow dance to. I suggested we choose something else, but she insisted we would just slow dance to it. I made her promise she wouldn't change her mind.\n\nSure enough, 30 seconds into the song she backs up and starts dancing a jig. I just stood there in disbelief fuming while she kept shouting and motioning for me to dance in front of all our guests. \n\nTo boot, we had set a budget, she exceeded it, then her parents decided to chip in 5K, and rather than use it to offset what we were over budget, she decided to spend more. \n\nIn retrospect, that should have been a huge clue that she didn't respect me at all. Cheated on me and ran off with some guy like a year later. Got 'remarried' before we were legally divorced. Her parents never did hand over the 5K, because they'd put a provision on it that we had to go up north for a weekend and take some stupid Christian financial planning course their friend ran.

Apparently they had a huge and physical fight the night before.  Their roommate at the time didnt come either.  He told me what he saw in the house the night before was enough for him to know this wedding was doomed and they should not be dating, let alone getting married.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT in an attempt to answer some of these questions:  First, this was about 20 years ago and we are all in our 40s now and have moved on with life since.  So,  I dont know why the mother wasnt there. I just remember thinking it was weird when I noticed she wasnt, and then later heard they were on the phone with her.   The roommate was visibly angry when I went to pick him up for the wedding.  Outright refused to come, and I think ended up moving out and basically disappearing after. He was a big dude who worked as a bouncer at clubs and my impression was he had to go into work mode the night before in his living room and wasnt happy about it.  I never heard details and I wouldnt have felt right asking for them.  I am still friends (in the sense that I see them every few years) with both the bride and groom, see my comment below for how they turned out. Happy ending considering.  I should also add, the years in which they dated and got married, all of us were very heavy binge drinkers. We were in our twenties and worked service industry jobs.  It seemed normal almost for this much drama to be around.  Looking back I dont have the same opinions. No one involved ended up in rehab or prison and all live relatively normal lives now.",

The groom had three best men, as well as ushers etc. His sister and one best man read something during the ceremony (and then all three said long speeches about him at dinner). It was all about him. \n\nThe photographer was even his friends Mum, so she kept whisking away the boys for these ‘hilarious’ lads shoots. \n\nThe bride was ignored most of the day and in the evening he got too drunk, spilt a drink over her wedding gown and danced with his friends. It felt more like a big birthday party than a joint event. \n\nI’d never seen that side to him, but I felt so sorry for my friend, it was like she was just there to be a prop to his plans and look good. \n\nThree months after the wedding he began being emotionally abusive. A month after that he admitted he’d been having an affair for years, then left. \n\nIf I hadn’t seen the way he behaved at the wedding, I never would have guessed he had that in him.\n\nEdit: As so many people are being kind, I’ll update you.

She basically told him when he left that he would never see her, or hear from her, or about her again. She dropped all friends that had a connection with him (after he left) and made sure he would always live his life wondering if he made the right decision and what she was up to.\n\nI really hope his dying thought is about her.

She actually had the balls to force fiance to apologise to the guy she was sleeping with for the accusations. The night of the bachelorette party she actually took all her bridesmaids back to the other guys house and spent the night with him. He came to their wedding.  It was SO AWKWARD. Everyone knew and everyone was talking. The groom was told, but chose to overlook it. After the wedding she insisted the other guy come on vacations with her and her husband and included him in all their social functions. Now, if they're non monogamous, whatever, go crazy! But her husband was an absolute wreck about it for years and she just kept gaslighting him. No one could convince him to leave her. She told my sister that affair guy insisted he would never marry her and didn't want kids so she was using fiance to get them. They ended up divorcing two years later after their second child was born. She immediately moved in with affair guy and they did end up getting married.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add a little more context since this comment blew up a bit. Everyone involved in this story was really young, except affair guy. He had already been married and divorced and had a few kids of his own by then, but he was still well under 30. The original couple had been together since middle school and all this went down between the ages of 21-23. I think the husband was just really naive and invested in the relationship. Small town marry your high school sweetheart and live happily ever after bullshit.  Affair guy did NOT go with them on their honeymoon, but he was included in group vacation plans before and after the wedding. Other people in the friend group did start refusing to go if he was involved. The bride had this really twisted power move that husband was not allowed to disrespect or offend affair guy. Any jealousy or suspicions were his own insecurities and anyone who said they were sleeping together just didn't understand platonic friendship. Affair guy was just a good friend, her best friend really, and husband needed to get over it. Bride and affair guy are still married and the second child is likely actually his.

I've never seen a 30 year old age backwards so quickly. She was just a brat. Literally stomping her feet in front of me, all her friends, and the other bride in the store. \\*I\\* was embarassed. At the end of all of that, she hangs up on him and her friend is like \"I'm so sorry you can't get your dress\" and the bride stops crying instantly and just goes \"Oh I'll get the dress. I just have to do this at home and when he gets mad enough he'll come get it for me so I'll stop.\"\n\nSpeechless. Sure enough. Girl came back two days later with her man and he applied for the credit card and bought the dress. He was livid and silent, and she was smug as hell. Can't imagine they're having a happy marriage if they are still together.",

She ended up slapping the groom, spilling champagne on her dress, and then crying under a table while he tried to comfort her. They lasted about 4 months.\n\nAnother one was my wife's friend. She's a very conservative, religious white girl who married a black man. Most of her racist family didn't approve of the marriage and didn't show up. But she planned the whole marriage around race. Like a vanilla cake for her and a chocolate cake for him, the wedding colors were black and white, and even the meals were white meat for her side and dark meat for his. It was extremely uncomfortable as a guest. They lasted 2 years (but broke up because he was abusive and almost killed her, rather than the weird racial tension).",

She ended up not getting any makeup done cause she wouldn’t stop scream-sobbing and refused to get dressed, stalling the wedding ~35 minutes.\n\nShe then said 45 minutes of “vows” that she had prepared (9 pages of things like inappropriate vows to friends and family, his parents and sisters, none of them her husband), and then ALMOST didn’t say “I do”.

She is really clingy and likes to gossip about how awful her husband is and I really don’t have the time. She’s also told me they’re in couples therapy after I expressed negativity towards some extremely concerning things she said regarding their relationship + lack of communication. But, I’m still betting on 10 months because she believes it’s all his fault and truly believes his parents and sisters are exactly the same (news flash, they’re all lovely people).\n\nEDIT #2 - 5 month update — I no longer associate with them so I’m out of the loop regarding juicy details. Last I heard they keep moving all over the country and fight non-stop. No more lovey-dovey images on social media. Seems to be right on track for a 10 month breakup.",

She was from a very rich family, but an extremely nice person.\n\nWe came into the venue a little bit early (it was sort of a castle near a small town). Things got delayed, and we had nothing to do for 6 hours straight. So me, my sister, and a couple of kids, went to explore (I was about 10-12). We rode a horse carriage, we played table football. Meanwhile, the guests started arriving.\n\nLater on, when I got dressed and went to talk to people, all people were doing was comparing the teeth of the groom and the bride. WHAT? Then we found out that they got dressed in the same room for the ceremony. In my country, that means bad luck. Then, the ceremony started. The hall was filled to brim with people, and the venue didn't bring enough chairs. Someone fainted. \n\nAfter it was done, they gave us, the kids, a bunch of presents, and we went to play. After a few hours, we just said \"Fuck it.\", and went to play table football again. The nearby bar closed, so our two cousins grabbed a few beers from the reception, and we went to the gatekeeper's booth to watch movies with him. There was like 6 kids watching that one movie with Leslie Nielsen with that stripper, and Saw 2. Right in the part when the big dude got his throat sliced at the end of the movie, our moms stormed in, screaming, and sent us to sleep.\n\nWe left a tad bit late. Apparently, a lot happened when we left the party, most of which was a total trainwreck. Fireworks exploding prematurely, someone getting drunk and throwing up all over the table, and so on. \n\nA few years later, they got divorced. She kept their son, he went on to have a kid with his classmate from elementary, and she got really invested into spiritualist bullshit.",

About 45 minutes after they arrived there was a large fist fight outside the hall - around 10 people (men & women) in tuxes and formal wear swinging punches, pulling people back, etc. Standard fight stuff. Then a minute or two later the bride and a guy in a tux jump into a limo and the car drove away....  turns out that was the best man.  \n\nThe fight was primarily between the two fathers & respective siblings from each family. It was very ugly. I don’t know for sure, but I bet they divorced shortly thereafter.",

He finally found this woman he met in rehab. Obviously that’s a horrible sign as if one person relapses they both have a high possibility to do it together. Not to mention this woman is only 22 while my dad is late thirties. To be fair she looked older and my dad looked younger but she also lied about her age saying she was late 20s. Well after 2 months of dating they decide to get married. My gf and I were almost 4 years into our relationship and still weren’t planning on getting married(and for good reason since 2 years later we broke up) but we supported them thinking it may be fit. Things between them were going fairly well, but I did not like this girl he was dating one bit. She tried to make me call her mom and treat her like my birth mother even though I was grown and only 4 years younger than her. That was a big issue for me so I told her that I will not accept her in my family. I also refused to go to the wedding because I feared it wouldn’t last. That may have been very rude, but I didn’t want to put myself through that trouble if I had this gut feeling that it was going to flop. Well 6 months later they’re married and in their own home, when suddenly she pulls the “I’m too young for this” and grabs all her stuff and leaves. Come to find out she began her relapse and chose heroine and alcohol over trying to stay sober and build a family. Today my dad still suffers with alcohol, and has a new wife(?) 8 states away from me with a new daughter. I hope this one works out but I’m not sure if it will. \n\n\nTL;DR  don’t date people you meet in rehab ESPECIALLY if it’s solely to fill in from someone you lost.",

We didn’t get in a fight or anything, weirdly enough I think every felt like during the election year he heaped a lot of his family’s negative opinion of liberal politics on me, the only liberal in small town SC. \n\nAnyway, I had friends who went to school with his new, also should be noted first, girl friend. One of them told me he watched her go to the parking lot during her free period and have a 3some in the student parking lot. There were so many other rumors that were relayed to me about this girl that it was pretty clear there had to be a nugget of truth to it all. \n\nSo, being that I knew this guy hates me now, I went to another friend and was like “hey I’ve got multiple friends from this other school telling me about his new girlfriend. I think he should know, but that news just shouldn’t come from me.” Well evidently, I picked the wrong guy to tell, cause he told everyone EXCEPT our buddy that was dating the girl. Fast forward 4 years, we’re going into junior year of college and no one has really seen the dude since graduation. During college he never tried to make new friends, or really get involved much, he just hung out with his girlfriend. Well, of course, they get engaged, he invites everyone except me to the wedding, but only like 4 people from our high school group have seen the dude in years so no one ends up going. The dude I initially told the rumor to was asked to be in the wedding party and when I asked if he was gonna do it he said, “I haven’t seen that dude in 4 years we’re not even friends. Also, he still doesn’t know [fiancé] was cheating on him in high school.” \n\nSo that’s basically how it goes for 8 months. None of us are in contact with him but all of us are waiting for the shoe to drop cause there’s just no way it works. Then one day I get a text, they’ve both deleted every picture of one another on Instagram, the surest sign something is wrong between people you don’t really know. We eventually find out he caught her cheating with her personal trainer when he came home early from work one day to surprise her. The most cliched way for a marriage to end.",

IMO it turned out pretty nice for what we had...\n\nBrides mother was supposed to pick up the cake in ATX and drive an hour south for the wedding.  She left her house 30 minutes before the wedding to pick it up.  When she finally showed up (hour late) the cake was DESTROYED....she put it in the back seat and drove like hell all the way down, just slamming it against box with every turn.\n\nDuring the one hour delay, there was almost a fist fight between two groomsmen because....well the MoH showed up, IN THE DRESS THAT SHE WAS 'UNABLE TO AFFORD'.  Obvious attempt to upstage the bride.  The same MoH during her speech after the ceremony started it of by saying 'When we all met, I did not like Drakkarim411 at all, however I found that he grows on you...like a fungus.'\n\nNeedless to say my entire side of the family was super cold to all of this.\n\nSince all of these issues were on her side of friendships or families, I was told to suck it up and we'll discuss later.  I sort of assumed that a lot of these 'friends' had just shown themselves the door.  Quite the opposite.  In fact, two years later when I accepted my first well paying job out of college, it became an issue that it was an hour and a half out of Austin...so she decided to just stay in ATX to be with her friends.\n\n...I mailed her the divorce papers and since she couldn't be bothered to even show up to the hearing....I've never seen her again.",

They had known each other most of their lives. I thought it was sweet. Until I met them. He was (is?) flamboyantly gay. He and the \"Best Man\" were clearly more than friends. After the big show, I get to see her. She's hanging out with a dude in their circle of friends and is clearly WAY into him, like, barely even hiding it... But we're there to work. Everybody is different, I don't know them and just try not to judge. I'm here to make a buck and frankly it's none of my business. I'm just smiling and doing my job. All the sudden during the Reception they are all over each other (the newly weds) and dancing and making out, doing the 'cake thing' and toasting, etc. Then like a light switch, they stop. The song finishes and everybody is just saying their good byes and leaving. We're like, the fuck?? Every body just cleared the F out... Turns out, he was from money, she was from money, and they were told if they married \"a good man/woman\" they would get a larger inheritance and stake in the family businesses, etc. This is in the south so if he came out as gay, good bye inheritance and I think her family just agreed upon him because they were childhood friends. They had a huge circle of friends that all knew they were marrying for the money so they played along. So if those two are still married (at least on paper) it's because their parents, or grandparents, or whoever, are still alive. Btw, the reception was over after the parents left. Once they cleared out, nobody even cared to be there. They did the celebrations to get their pics for the hallways of grandpas building, then fuck 'em... We out. By the way, I didn't know nay of this until my boss told me at the end. At the end she told and everything that happened in the previous couple hours all made sense.",

The wedding was in the backyard of the bride’s house. They had all the chairs and wedding \"arch\" setup outside. They setup a plastic tarp running down the aisle to walk on. Just before the wedding starts, there are darkening clouds appearing. Should have been a sign to move the wedding inside, but they invited too many people to the damn thing.  \nJust as they start the wedding, it begins to rain lightly. The father of the bride is walking the bride down the lane and slips on the wet tarp and falls on his ass. Bride is now at the front, raining harder. People start to cover up with whatever they have. Some people start to get up too. Bride turns around and says to all, **THIS IS MY WEDDING, NO ONE IS GOING TO RUIN IT, YOU BETTER ALL FUCKING SIT YOUR ASSES DOWN!**  \nWe all sit back down and the wedding resumes. It is now raining pretty good. The grass is now turning into mud. A few ladies in the crowd and the bridesmaid’s makeup is now running down the faces. My wife has taken my jacket as a cover from the rain. They finish the vows and kiss, and then everyone runs to the house and garage to get out of the rain. Oh, remember how I said the grass was now mud? Yea, lots of people slipped and fell in the mud on the way to the house.  \nWe got to the house, many people look terrible from the running makeup, muddy clothing, and soaking wet. A few of the women had to cover their chests and waists due to wet clothing becoming see-thru. Most of the men were loaning their coats to the ladies to cover up. Dirty looks all around.  \nThe wedding cake was outside, and now brought in. The rain made the decorations on the cake turn all runny and it looks horrible. The bride and groom began to cut the cake and feed each other. The smashed the cake pieces into each other’s faces....then began a food fight with each other. My friend’s wife got hit in the face with purple icing cake on her face and dress. The priest got hit with and yellow icing on his white robe. There was nothing left of the cake to serve.  \nFood being served was still frozen in the middle of the food and the stuff that was not frozen, was burned. The desert was supped to be the cake, but as said above, there was nothing left. There was a goody bag that people got on the way out. Had a lollipop, a coupon for ice cream cone at McDonald's, a pencil with the bride and groom name on it, and Halloween size M&Ms.  \nMy wife, whose dress was filthy, her makeup was out of whack, and her hair was a mess, said to me that she does not want to see those people again for 6 months she was so mad. The couple divorced 11 months later when the groom came home from work and found his wife getting double teamed by two guys.",

Like the human equivalent of getting a glob of cheesecake stuck in your mustache and not noticing until you wake up the next morning.  If I had to pin down an exact moment, I'd say it was the reaction of the bride to the insane bullshit that was going on.\n\nThe mother of the bride completely took over everything and micro-managed everyone who had anything to do with it.  She rolled up with her own personal astrologer and Feng shui expert, and these people had  the final approval for everything.  The entire venue had to be rearranged the morning of the wedding because the Feng shui expert thought the number of seating rows was inauspicious.  He also nixed most of the flower choices at the last minute for some convoluted reason.  Thanks to the astrologer, the date had to be changed twice after the invites were already sent out.  She also had some very specific demands about the order guests went up in to get food at the reception.  The groom was one of my best friends from high school, and I was supposed to be a groomsman until the astrologer intervened.  The nonsense kept coming.  These are just a small handful of examples.\n\nEventually, it kind of came to a head during the reception itself. The feng shui expert wanted everybody to move across the dance floor in a certain direction while dancing.  He was making a scene on the dance floor and everybody was getting confused, so a few of us convinced the maid of honor to go ask the bride to overrule the expert.  The maid of honor was polite in her request, but the bride just looked at her wide eyed and said \"this is very important to my mother.\"\n\nIt lasted about a year.  We shared a bottle of good whiskey with the groom once the divorce was finalized.",

Long story short, after the ceremony (which was beautiful & uneventful) they were taking family photos and during the groom’s family photos, the grooms somewhat estranged half-sister said something horribly offensive about the bride which was not directly heard by groom but WAS beard by the bride and became a “he said-she said thing” and the groom SIDED WITH HIS SISTER in the ensuing arguments. I don’t remember all the details but he basically sided that his sister never said the offensive thing. Bride (my friend) was sensitive and was highly emotional due to stress of wedding and could not forgive it. \n\nThus led to ENTIRE groom’s side of the family boycotting the reception and instead congregating in the gravel parking lot down the hill from the reception hall. Bride cried through all her portrait photos and we kept having to console her. Groom walked back his support of his sister and ended up getting so mad he wanted to “set things right” by physically duking it out with his sisters husband(?) for some reason, which led to a lot of arguing and fighting. All the groomsmen sided with the groom’s sister so that didn’t help. \n\nI had to literally march over to the groom and his family in the gravel parking lot after about two hours because people were hungry and waiting for the groom’s wedding party to make their entrance to eat. I had to actually emits them that this day WASN’T ABOUT THEM & demand they return to the wedding so everyone could eat and continue on with the night. \n\nHad to go find the bride multiple times as she was in tears in various locations. I kept apologizing to the photographer as she was really put in the middle of B&G throughout that whole thing and kinda ended up consoling one or the other the whole evening instead of taking photos. \n\nOne of the uncles tried to have a “come to Jesus” meeting with the groom’s family to convince them to come back to the wedding which ended with uncle in tears and nothing resolved. It just goes to show how immature and petty groom’s family was (which I didn’t know before hand). \n\nI also thought it was so odd that the groom wouldn’t side with his own wife on an issue especially on THEIR WEDDING DAY??! \n\nThis coupled with husband’s existing financial issues  (the wife paid for wedding 90% on her own with cash savings, groom had no savings and went into debt for engagement ring) and lack of communication receptiveness on things like having children (one extremely for, one extremely against biological kids) their marriage lasted about a month until they separated and got a divorce.",

The bride was wearing a white princess outfit and from what I remember was kinda acting like one too, but hey it’s her wedding you do you queen. However I don’t think the groom and the bride were on the same page because he was drinking with the bros and being loud and having a rowdy blast. The bride sits at the table and bad mouthing him for most of the meal, then comes the cake cutting. Now I don’t know if this is tradition in general or just one in my family because we are part trickster, but during the cake cutting we shove cake in each other’s face and kiss each other on the cheek. The caveat to this is that normally it is talked about before hand. This rowdy groom takes his slice as she grabs her cake and a fork. The bride turns to him while picking up a bite of cake and looks up to a plate of cake plunging to her face. *Boom!!* cake all OVER her face, and as the plate falls it slides all the way down the front of her dress leaving a dark brown stain. She is frozen, he laughs, and there goes the bride. She hurdles out of the room a streak of chocolate cake and tears and the room remains silent except for the riotous laughter of the bros and groom. A lady, one I can only assume is the mother in law, stands up and yells, “you’re a giant asshole.” And chases the bride down. The room dies now, and the groom stands there now, realizing things have gone south. The father of the groom goes and tells the DJ to play something. The DJ tries his best to break the tension and announces that cake will be served, but with forks and napkins. I’m not sure how they have faired but the groom did go and smooth things over with the poor lady, but I just never thought they were a good match and that moment kinda reaffirmed that belief.",

            "text": "I have been a wedding DJ for like 25 years and I have often thought about making a book about these stories. I'll try to tell a quick one. Where I live there is a place called the Belgian Club and it is the lowest cost venue that is a private club and serves alcohol. In fact, I think that they probably make up their rental margins on the volume of alcohol sales. So anytime you are going to the Belgian Club you know that booze is going to be a factor. In Northern Wisconsin where this is located there is a tradition where groomsmen will *steal* the bride or sometimes bridesmaids *steal* the groom. From a DJs perspective it is a terrible tradition as it grinds the entire event down to a halt for however they are gone which is sometimes an hour or more. So at this particular event the groom was \"stolen\" which means they take the limo or whatever and go to another bar and do Lord-only-knows-what. Before it happened I think the bride came to me and asked me to try and stop it which is truly not part of my job but I tried. It didn't work and when they came back I realized why she had been so upset. One if the bridesmaids had apparently cheated with the groom previously and there was an allegation that she had done something with him while he had been stolen. Anyway, they finally get back and while I am trying to set up the first dance she screamed and confronted him and I think she even slapped him. Yep, in front of the entire gathered assembly and all of their friends and family. The allegedly cheater bridesmaid got into it and I believe the bride started to pull her hair and they had to be dragged apart and off of the dance floor. Believe it or not they were able to attempt to compose themselves and we still did the formal dances including a bridal party dance which I was on high alert for just in case it came to blows again.  That might be the lowest of the lowlights of terrible weddings I DJ'd. Just terrible, terrible people to run off like that during the wedding reception given their history, whether or they actually had sex at that time almost doesn't even matter. I feel for the Bride but why would you go ahead with the wedding if things were so unstable and insecure to start with?",

The couple were all around trash, but I was young and short on friends so I went with it.\n\nThe night before the wedding, the groom and groomsmens one and only job had been to bring the archway that the couple would get married in. Except they hadn’t built it. Or purchased the materials. So like 18 hours to showtime, they show up with a weird assortment of tools and PVC piping and construct the worlds shittiest archway. My friend then draped poorly cut Walmart fabric over the PVC pipes in an attempt to make it better, but the fabric was so sheer that she couldn’t really hide the duct tape that was used to hold the archway together.\n\nOh and then she wrote her vows at McDonald’s the night before.\n\nThey are no longer married.",

I mean, the week after, he was getting married to a girl from the next town over whom we never met.\n\nThe wedding was a nice small affair of maybe 30 people with my best friend & I being the only friends of the groom.  The only other person on his side of the aisle was his mother who had been battling cancer for a few months.\n\nSo after the wedding they invited a few of us over to their new house for an after party.  That in itself seemed odd, but I was clumsily flirting with the bride's cousin so I accepted.\n\nA couple of hours later, the bride was sloppy drunk and being verbally abusive.  Nothing super crazy, but just mean girl talk.  The groom was trying to calm her down and the guests all started to leave.  She got mad that everyone was leaving and while chasing her cousin down she tripped into and completely destroyed their fish tank.\n\nShe berated her new husband for the accident and slapped him repeatedly (he was nowhere near the incident when it happened).  Knew then & there it wasn't going to last long.\n\nIt lasted about a year, with most of it being unhappily cohabitating until they could each make it on their own.\n\nThe heartbreaking part of this is that his mother passed away the month after the wedding.

Their relationship had been a little shaky and on and off over the years but they both seemed to want to settle down. I wasn’t a huge fan of the idea, but my mum said she was happy, so I wanted to support her. \r  \n\r  \nThe night before their wedding they got a bit tipsy and went to play badminton with some of their friends from their badminton club. \r  \n\r  \nI was at their house, home from uni for the summer, with one of his daughters and a friend who were staying the night in preparation for the big day. We had ourselves some drinks, expected them to be back early evening - however they never showed up - so we just kept drinking and then the message came that my mum was in the hospital! \r  \nShe'd taken a direct hit to her eye from a shuttlecock, yikes! (and not from him, they were playing doubles on the same team)\r  \n\r  \nWe were stunned but assured she was OK and being well looked after and so went to bed. The following morning, we got up, and dressed, hungover and a little bedraggled from the strange turn of events but still putting our best feet forward for their special day. To our surprise, the happy-couple-to-be were running later than we were. We kept clock watching and anxiously waiting for news. \r  \n\r  \nWhen they arrived, my mum looked in a terrible state. She told me she had checked herself out of the hospital against medical advice, but I still did not realise how bad her injury was. She got ready, in the most gorgeous red gown and make up. She assured us time and again that she wanted to get married and not waste all the money they spent on the venue and to not let the guests down. Her face was puffy so we helped style her hair to cover up the injury as best we could.\r  \n\r  \nThe ceremony was, well, awkward, my mum was woozy and struggled throughout. She then left the reception early while he danced the night away. Us 'kids' got a taxi back to the house, still blissfully unaware of how unwell she was.\r  \n\r  \nI had to return to uni in a different town the following day and only realised how severe the accident had been after I was out of town. Her pupil had ruptured from the force. She spent the first 6 months of that marriage half-blind and relearning how to do simple tasks such as cutting a tomato in half. He was miserable too, it’s not the picture of bliss they had imagined.  \n\r  \nIn hindsight I think they should have called off the wedding, none of us would have been offended if they did, even more-so if we knew how badly she was injured, and I have to wonder why he went along with it all. I mean, isn’t that a clear sign from the universe to call it off?!\r  \n\r  \nThey did stay married for several years but the only thing that ran smooth after that was the scotch. The divorce wasn’t overly bitter, but I think the loss of friendship with this person was hard on my mum. Sadly, he passed away a few years after their split at quite a young age (50s) and I know that hit her hard.\r  \n\r  \nShe still has a broken ‘Bowie’ pupil, it’s permanently dilated so she is meant to wear sunglasses outside or use a thick contact lens to protect the remaining sight in that eye. She tells me that it’s like looking through a kaleidoscope. She constantly has swirls and patterns and flashes of light in that eye. She says that every optician she has been to is utterly fascinated by it because it’s a rare thing to see in their profession and that after many years she has adjusted to ignore the odd visuals.\r  \n\r  \nSo I guess if life smacks you hard in the eyeball the night before your wedding – maybe don’t get married?!",

Till that day, I had met her once and didn't like her at all. Not for the same reasons as him, but I could see why he would be unhappy with her.   \n\n\nI think everyone could see this not going anywhere form a mile away. Even on the day of the weeding her family \"jokingly\" told the groom: \"Well, last chance: Do you want to get out?\"...and of course the idiot didn't say anything.   \nThe official at the registry had a little speech about the bride and groom prepared, but...well, he didn't get the name of the groom right. Not even close. And after that he said something like: \"Well, both of them don't share any common interrests, but their dog and sitting on the sofa and watching TV\". That's just...sad. Really sad.   \n\n\nThe next week his bitching about her started again. How they spent so much money on the wedding, he'd rather spend it on stuff for himself. And now she was quite serious about having kids, him getting a better job. The \"classics\". I ditched their ceremony at the church, which was at a later date. I didn't give them a year. They managed to last almost three, after she finally got pregnant with kids. After they were born the decided to call it quits, though her family tried talking him into staying. \"Think about the kids\". Dude has allready a kid with another woman he doesn't care about.   \n\n\nNow he's back into debt, living with a co-worker in a way too small apartment and \"living his best life!\". Sure, dude. Was nice knowing you...",

He left her to do literally everything for the wedding, every detail.. Both have cheated on eachother and neither has admitted to it to each other and neither know.  I only know because I had a relationship built on trust with the brides family(even dated the brides half sister before the marriage)Also after helping  him understand morality(he was a theif, like robbed over 100 houses)  I was always a rightous kid growing up despite the neiborhood I was raised in, I always tried to steer him in the right direction despite being younger by four years.. he made some guy he had just met his best man over me because he had money to cover strip dances and coke the night  of the bachelor's party which ended up getting ruined by his halve brother who molested the brides halve sister years ago(same person I had a relationship with). Also the bacherlors  was done the night before the wedding and everyone was coked  out until 9 am when the wedding was at 1 pm.

Shouldn't the bride's sister and maid of honor have had a chance to get to know the groom before the wedding, and same for the Best Man and the bride? Then when we went to say our goodbyes before leaving the reception, the bride was double-fisting drinks and slurring while she told us how panicked she was for the ceremony and how she was too drunk to say her vows and put the ring on her husband at the same time. I understand being nervous, but she said \"panic\" multiple times and put a lot of emphasis on it. Later found out she never drinks, so I thought it was really strange that she picked her wedding day to drink all day. This wedding was just a few weekends ago so I don't know the outcome yet, but the bride's behavior and the toasts gave me the heebie jeebies. Oh, and before the ceremony started, we heard another guest say something about how there was \"drama\" before the ceremony. Definitely not how I want my wedding to go!",

It really looked like a big splendid wedding.\n\nAnywho, we had paid for the hotel with our credit card points and that hotel had a separate floor just for those using points.  At around 11pm I heard a man and woman fighting in the room across from ours.  It went on and on forever.  It's now 1am, I hear what sounds like the man had kicked out the woman out of the room and she's sobbing and begging him to open the door.  At this point I open my door and ask her if she needs me to call someone for her or get help.  That's when I see that it's the bride laying on the floor in her wedding dress!  She tries to play it off like she's just out there for no reason.\n\nThe fighting continues.  At 3am I call the front desk.  They tell me that they already have someone headed to the room after receiving multiple calls and that they are kicking them out of the hotel.  Imagine being kicked out of a hotel on your wedding night!!  Weird too that they had such a lavish wedding but then used credit card points to pay for the room.

Myself and the other coordinator said “hey groom, we already started lining everyone up, it’s time to start your ceremony, we need you…since it’s your wedding…” and he no joke sat there silent still playing the game before he said “yeah give me a second, I really can’t pause this right now” \n\nRIGHT BEFORE HIS OWN DAMN WEDDING CEREMONY.\n\nThe ceremony ended up starting off delayed because he didn’t want to separate himself from his game.

Constantly “sneaking” drinks from behind the bar and just generally making assess of themselves. The groom was was pretty drunk by the time it came to cut the cake.\n\nSo the time comes to feed each other cake, and the bride playfully pushed the cake into the grooms face—nothing unusual about this, it happens every other wedding. The typical response is that the groom playfully shoves his cake in the brides face, or the really smooth guys just kiss the bride all while covered in cake, thereby giving them both cakeface. It’s cute.\n\nThat’s not what frat boy over here did.\n\nHe roughly tries to shove his cake into her mouth, and she dodges it and turns away laughing. As she’s kind of jokingly running away, HE GRABS HER BY THE HAIR—WITH HIS CAKE COVERED HAND—AND PULLS HER BACKWARDS.\n\nMind you, this woman’s hair was STUNNING. She obviously paid someone quite a bit of money to make it look the way that it did. In about half a second the mood shifted from lighthearted laughter to, “oh fuck did he just do that?”\n\nThe groomsmen are falling over themselves laughing while the bridesmaids and the catering manager rush this poor woman (who had begun crying in the mean time) off to try to fix her hair and calm her down.\n\nThe groom turned around and kinda shrugged like, “what did I do wringt?” And laughed it off with his boys. We didn’t see the bride again for probably 45 minutes to and hour.\n\nThe DJ was able to salvage the moment with some quick “Love Shack,” but everyone—from the guests to the catering staff—was thinking the same thing: this ain’t gonna last.\n\nThat was a couple years ago and it would not shock me in the slightest if they are long divorced.",

But gave that bride some kind of reason as to why she couldn't make it to their wedding (maybe because she knew me and my wife for a longer period of time?). Told us in private that she was going to ours instead because there was no way that other one was going to work out. Red flags everywhere. Sure enough, they were definitely divorced within the year.\n\nOoo! Forgot about the one I actually kind of had a part in. Had a one night stand (which was the first and only time for me, boy was that a mistake), and the girl let me know afterwards that she wanted it to be more than just that. Wasn't a fan of the idea. Tried to make that clear, finally did so. And then found out that she was currently just \"on a break\" from her fiance in the military and they were getting back together soon. Ok, cool, I feel less bad about trying to ghost you. She also tried to come over to my apartment so she could bitch about her fiance, wanted to do a double date with me and my gf (my gf was way too excited about this possibility, since she knew how bizarre the whole thing was), and then invited me to drink with her in the hot tub alone. This was all after the fiance reveal. \n\nI was also good friends with one of the girls who would be fiance chick's bridesmaid. The day of the wedding, bridesmaid catches fiance chick blowing her boyfriend. So wedding got canceled at this point for the 2nd? time. Bridesmaid told me much later on that fiance chick still ended up marrying her guy, who took her back after multiple known times of cheating on him. I did not think that he was the best looking guy, so I'm assuming it had something to do with not wanting to lose someone who he knows is somewhat interested in him? A little mean, but I couldn't figure out why the hell he would still marry her after all the shit she did. Last I saw, they were no longer together and she was married to someone who looked like they were a good 20-25 years older than me. Holy crap, I do not miss that kind of drama.\n\nEdit: added a story and fixed some details",

It wasn’t a huge wedding - only about 75 people - but everyone that went traveled there and paid for the very expensive hotel, as well as gifts and, for groomsmen, clothes and shoes (because she didn’t want rental suits, but also didn’t want us to wear our own chinos, white shirts, and boat shoes).\n\nAfter the rehearsal, everyone in our friends group who had flown down wanted to go out and hang together since no one had gotten to see him the whole time, other than the couple of us who were standing up. We rented a little party bus and wanted to take them out to bar hop a little bit. First, she refused. Then she gave in, but sat on his lap the entire time and didn’t really allow him to dance or talk or goof around with any of us. Then she made them call a cab to leave at 9:00. Okay, it’s the night before the wedding, get some rest, somewhat understandable. The rest of us stayed out. \n\nThe next day the little beachside wedding was nice, but before dinner the two of them left to take pictures. Dinner was served. Dinner ended. They still hadn’t returned. They came back as dancing started, then they sat down to eat, so no one was dancing or hanging with them. Eventually they did the father/daughter, mother/son dance. He watched her and smiled the whole time. When he and his mom danced, she paid no attention and talked to someone with her back to the dance floor the entire time. Then, around 9:30, the DJ announces that we have to start wrapping up, and can everyone grab a chair and stack it over there in the corner, we need to be out at 10. This was in the very nice little event space in the hotel. We were all kind of dumbstruck and caught off guard. They had barely finished dinner and just done the few dances. \n\nSo afterwards, everyone gathered by the pool and kept drinking and having fun together, but they were nowhere to be found. They came out eventually and one of our friends said “Hey, we didn’t really get to spend any time with you guys this weekend. Are there any breakfast plans tomorrow? Maybe we can get everyone together.” She snapped back “We have a 7:30 flight to go on our honeymoon. We’re getting the hell of out of here.”\n\nOther details: she had just one or two friends fly down, one of whom hung out with us and told us she was surprised that she was even included in the wedding because they’re not particularly close. Her parents paid for the wedding on the condition that her sister be her maid of honor, despite them not being friendly with each other. So it was basically ALL of our friends, who have known each other 20+ years at this point, and their families, and that’s all. \n\nEveryone flew to Florida for the wedding and barely saw the bride and groom. No good. \n\nThey moved to Texas shortly afterward, and divorced about a year later. Rumor was that she had pretty much immediately started cheating on him, but he’s never talked about it. Sad, really. Everyone kind of knew it was no good and just watched it unfold in slow motion, and it had some pretty severe effects on our friendship for years to come. That winter I got married and he didn’t come because he “couldn’t get off work” and didn’t tell me until I had to call and confirm because I hadn’t gotten their RSVP by the deadline.\n\nWhew. It was actually pretty cathartic to type that all out.",

I have edited it slightly to add a few details and I assure you that every word is true. \n\n\nI would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.\n\n\nThis is a tale of love, betrayal, narcissism, casual racism and, in the end, mind bending insanity.\n\n\nSeveral years ago, a friend married his girlfriend. We all decamped to a beautiful part of the UK for the wedding and all seemed to be fine and dandy until...\n\n\nTHE SPEECH.\n\n\nThe father of the bride, ostensibly a pillar of the community, stood up to do his speech and, by God, did he make the most of it. He kicked off by presenting us with the old adage 'children are the future' as if it was some amazing new concept that he alone had the insight to appreciate. He then immediately dropped that thought to praise his daughter, her stepmother and, especially, himself. Much of the time was spent detailing how much money he had spent on the wedding and how much work was involved on his part. Yay him.\n\n\nThe best bit was when he drew our attention to the cake and also to the receipts relating to its cost that he had framed and put on display next to it.\n\n\nAfter a full hour (no exaggeration) of this bragging and self praise with no mention of his new son in law or his family he suddenly seemed to remember his intitial theme, declared once again that 'children are the future' like a fat, white Whitney Houston and announced that he had a treat later for all the kids who were there. He then left the room to applause from his close friends and family and bemusement from everyone else.\n\n\nHalf an hour later he reappeared. Dressed as an Arab sheik. To top off the look, he had blacked up with boot polish.\n\n\nHe called for the attention of all who had not yet become transfixed by the sudden appearance of something out of one of those Two Ronnies sketches that don't get included in compilation shows any more. He then informed us that, as children are the future, all adults present should show their appreciation by giving each and every child present £2.\n\n\nThere were around 30 kids in the room so every one of us was, apparently, expected to give away £60 in loose change that we all had in our pockets to kids that most of us had never met. \n\n\nHe then led the kids in a conga of capitalism, dancing around the room like a fat, racist Fagin stopping at every table so money could be extorted. Under the pretext of needing the loo, I decided 'bugger this for a game of soldiers' and managed to escape to the bar where the £5 or so I had in my pocket remained safe. Hooray for debit cards. \n\n\nIt won't surprise you, dear reader, to learn that the marriage didn't last long (a little under four months) and that the whole charade appears to have been a calculated attempt to take my friend for half of everything he owns with the father apparently having prepared paperwork for the divorce prior to the wedding. In the end, this ruse failed and she left with a token pay off of a couple of thousand pounds.\n\n\nHere comes the craziest part. Brace yourselves. All that has gone before pales in comparison. \n\n\nOnce the divorce was underway, my friend no longer felt bound by the vow he had made not to reveal his in-laws' oddest secret which he gleefully revealed to me. They genuinely believe themselves to be the earthly form of some kind of pan-dimensional rabbit beings. I believe that the official term is 'Otherkin'. No offence to any of their fellow believers out there, but you're a bunch of loonies. \n\n\nAt weekends, they travel about the countryside in search of their cotton-tailed brethren whom they approach and converse with. They then head home and relay the information gleaned from the field agent bunnies to a pair of small rabbit statues that stand on top of an upright piano and are, presumably, some sort of interdimensional comms device. \n\n\nNeedless to say, I think my friend had a lucky escape!

My wife would never admit any flaws in her family out of respect and maybe im a little upfront as an american but i saw this coming from a mile away and temember before i got married me and my wife agreed we would never fight like that and always work out our issues and talk and not fight or name call and we have been together 5 years now without any of that shit happening.

My brother smoked two packs or more of cigarettes while my parents tried to get him to call off the wedding and let the guests go home (it was middle of summer in GA) and then talk it out w the bride. They went through w it and brides mother called the cops on him for kidnapping the bride as they started out on the honeymoon (this would not be the only time). The pastor also never asked if anyone objected to the union (which I was tensing my arm for). Oh, and my mom hit a deer on the way home that night and a visiting cousin broke her foot that weekend. All in all a fun story to retell",

Dad thought it would be a good step for the son-in-law-to-be to begin working at the family businesses. We got our invitations, hotel reservations, sent the wedding gifts ahead, and ready to drive the four hours to their city. They had booked the country club and a very well known singer and orchestra to play; someone you would never consider would do a private gig. Chef and staff, limos for the families ... several hundred people, pretty big deal.\n\nA courier drove up and handed us a *telegram* ... never received one before (early 90s). It read, \"The wedding between \\_\\_\\_ and \\_\\_\\_\\_ will not take place.\"\n\nWow. The next month we were visiting with the father and asked what happened. Quote: \"I left five dollars on the table ... I placed him in charge of an account if some cash disappeared from this one account he would be the only one who had access it. He took it. *A lot*. I told \\_\\_\\_\\_ if she couldn't trust him with her money she couldn't trust him with her marriage.\"\n\nOur reaction was, \"That must have been expensive.\"\n\nHis answer, \"Still cheaper than a divorce.\"",

They also did a \"dance battle\" to start off the dancing portion of the reception. One of the groomsmen did the worm... in a kilt... wearing nothing but a bro thong). But we knew going into it that it'd be a miracle if they didn't divorce. Just a bad relationship. He was a neckbeardy douche in general but a particularly big asshole to her. She was a sweetheart... but im pretty sure she also cheated on him? Once we were all camping and she was GRINDING on his buddy literally behind his back at the campfire. So his back was turned but everyone else could see what was happening. What an awkward weekend that was. They got divorced in maybe less than a year after. I never heard the story so I don't have those details. She just got engaged again (they were married I think in 2016). I haven't met him but he seems nice and she seems much happier.",

She had drawn up an elaborate timetable that included who had  to eat together when and where, and as his college buddies our time with him had obviously been minimized because we were a “bad influence”.\n\nFor some background, they had gotten together in high school and he went out of state for college, she tried to stop it, but she wouldn’t let him stay out past 10 PM, and she would insist on a 10 PM phone call every Friday and Saturday night from his dorm landline to make sure he wasn’t “out doing things he shouldn’t be”. We are sometimes went through elaborate scenarios in order to avoid having to take him back to his room at 10 and go back out, but they didn’t always work and sometimes she caught on, so she didn’t  trust any of us.\n\nThe night before the wedding, everything had been done, the rehearsal dinner was complete, there was literally nothing for him to do but wake up and go to the wedding the next morning. Keeping it traditional, he wasn’t allowed to see her so he was just sitting in his room doing nothing. We decided to spring him around 6 PM to take him out for one last night together. We were out in rural Pennsylvania so there wasn’t much else to do, so we were just going to hit up Applebee’s for dinner and some beers and then go to the town comic book store for one last D&D session. \n\nShe had apparently foreseen this, and was convinced we were taking him to Philly for some sort of crazy all night while bachelor party. So when we grabbed him from his room, he made some protests because he didn’t want her mad, but we threw a blanket over his head and told him he’s being kidnapped to give him some deniability. We took him down the freight elevator and tried to go out the back of the hotel next to the loading dock. She had stationed all of her friends at all the exits, even the fucking fire escape, and honest to God 2-way radios to make sure we didn’t try to sneak him out. She was convinced that we were going to take him out and not bring him back for the wedding and her perfect day would be ruined, and it wasn’t even fucking 6 PM yet.\n\nAnyway that was a long time ago in. Last I heard from him he was fighting to get monthly  visits with their kid.",

As a bartender this is valuable information.\n\nSeeing the couple, there was definitely something wrong.\n\nTHE BRIDE appeared to have some sort of phsyical deformity on her face, but that did not hide the biggest frown and attitude. She had her arms crossed most of the night and ordered a couple glasses of mimosas (before vomiting onto her wedding gown - I have a pretty strict rule with the wedding party, and definitely not my doing). I haven't seen her engage with the grooms family.\n\nTHE GROOM, for a lack of better terms was a 'beta'. Everyone, even the guys cleaning dishes, could see that he was doing his best to appease his wife. I saw him a lot with his hands in his pockets, having that 'getting by' smile... felt sorry for the dude. Didn't order a single drink, not even coffee or water.\n\nTHE WEDDING PARTY pretty much knew it wouldn't last long in speaking with them. I asked the maids what's with the bride, but none would give me a straight answer. \n\nThe party was literally split down the middle, I had the party come at me at waves...bride's family, then groom's, then bride's..no inter-mingling whatsoever. Ended quite early, around 10pm.\n\nI had my hourly pay and $40.00 in tip that night.",

            "text": "Oh boy, it was a family members wedding. They’d had been dating since high school and were early 20s. Bride was a definite bridezilla. I was in the wedding and as I was in the bridal suite, she stood on a pedestal and ordered people around the entire time. Her soon-to-be-MIL was making the bouquet (including the brides!) the day off. Each time MIL would show what she had created, bride would make demands to change things. Luckily, it was done by the ceremony. Then, the bride and groom exchanged notes before the ceremony. She read hers and started to fan herself and cry an insane amount. I happened upon the note…all it said was “let’s do this.” \n\nDuring the ceremony, a bridesmaid, not once but twice FAINTED and neither the bride or the groom moved a muscle to help her up. It almost seemed like they were inconvenienced. \n\nGroom was so drunk he didn’t remember his own reception. Oh, and there was enough booze to entertain a entire army, but they had forgotten to buy water. WATER! It was a Texas wedding so it was hot as hell. As the groom and bride left (and me worrying about the groom driving in his inebriated state) the owner of reception hall ran out of the hall screaming that we all needed to stay to clean up. She yelled at my family who literally had no say nor booked the venue. My partner, who was the only sober one, had to intervene to calm the lady down. Turns out, the brides family assumed they could come the next day and clean up. That might have been true? Or the reception hall owner didn’t know that? I have no idea…\n\nWhen I asked the bride how married life was a few months later she said, “Literally nothing is different and I wouldn’t have as big of a wedding next time.” Hmmmmm……\n\nThey are still together, but sometimes I wonder if it’ll last…..",

After a few years, they split up because she felt that she got married too early and never got to enjoy her \"wild period\" in her early 20's that all of her friends were getting to.  Since the split, she has been in jail a couple of times and has had a small issue with drug abuse.  \n\nThe wedding itself was MASSIVE, 6 bridesmaids and groomsmen each, ridiculous flower arrangements, candles, fully formal wedding.  Every warning sign was there for a doomed marraige and everyone other than the two immediate families could see it.  The only surprise in the whole thing was that the marriage lasted 3 years.\n\nWhen you do the math, he was 23 when they started dating and she was 16.  He was the oldest person, other than chaperones, at her junior and senior proms which were his 7th and 8th consecutive proms, he apparently liked them young... Gotta love Kentucky.\n\nThe best part of the wedding was my sweet little southern grandmother pulling my girlfriend and I away from the crowd and, with a very steely expression on her face, said that if i got my girlfriend pregnant before we were married, she would cut my dick off.  My girlfriend absolutely died laughing while I turned bright, shiny red.  So far, my niece and her husband and my wife and I have been the only two couples on this side of the family, out of 7 kids, to not have a kid before marraige.",

            "text": "I went to school for a year in a small town with cousins. I had the reputation for being a rebel and a big city girl. It was during that time a guy two classes ahead of me started confiding in me. We will call him \"W\". Eventually sharing the fact that he was gay. I think he said he liked guys not girls because I don't recall the word \"gay\" being widely used then. Despite it being the very early 70's I did know same-sex adults in my hometown. He felt better to tell someone. All was well between us but he was from a very conservative family and had parents who were big fish in a small town. Dad owned several businesses and mom would have bridge games at the house and sing an aria to her guests. Very hoity-toity and kind of a joke anywhere but this small town.\n\nHe graduated that Spring and I moved back to the city. I was a bit of a bad girl and a couple of years later I proved it. Pregnant in high school. My now ex-husband was an ass but his family was excellent and accepting. It was a wedding in the judge's office with no guests. Then one Saturday my ex wanted to go visit his grandma. She was a fantastic woman and I happily went with him. Imagine my surprise when I walked into the parlor and saw \"W\" cozied up on the couch next to my ex's cousin. The color drained out of his face. They were in the final phase of wedding planning. Color me confused.\n\nWe eventually left after I'd failed to get him alone to speak to him. He did say \"You look familiar\" and I played along with \"where'd you go to school\". Keep in mind there were only about 75 people in each class. I was new to the whole family and still a little stunned. I replied he looked familiar too.\n\nI sought him out and asked him if something had changed. No nothing had changed he said but his family made it impossible to do anything but marry a woman. \"R\" my husband's cousin was grateful as she'd had no prospects and never even had a date in high school. I asked if she knew. She did not. We talked for some time and he was unmoved. He was going through with it.\n\nI spoke to my husband and we decided it wasn't my place to tell anyone. Then we attended the wedding which went as you might guess. All set up for the bride's mother who sang three times and as others here mentioned \"R\" was ignored and it was all about mom and \"W\". Best part? Halfway through her second song, the ringbearer ran to the altar while holding his crotch and howled \"I GOTTA PEE\" Mom was indignant and started the song again...ep it quiet. In the end, \"R\" found her courage and left him. What really bothered me was he tried to lay blame on me for not busting him before the marriage. She was heartbroken for some time but raised her kids eventually co-parenting together and met someone nice later in life.",

He took me to a Diamonds Direct and said I had $1k, pick out a ring and we'd go. (FWIW, we were already married - we had eloped after 3 months of dating, and he forbade me from telling anyone.

I was shocked and disgusted by the number of people who were openly criticising both families for being backward village bumpkins, but not doing anything to help.\n\nA couple of weeks later the bride took some money from the groom's shop and flew back to the motherland, but was found. I believe she was killed for bringing shame within a month of the marriage. As a teenager it was fucked up to see all this and see the openness of all the stupidity while seeing very little help. I'd seen arguments at weddings before, but this was extreme. It made me ignore a lot of the so called traditional ceremonial crap. Nothing happened to the groom.

Think essentially a VFW quality venue, but with pseudo masonic stuff going on.\n\nThe couple did their vows, and they were both extremely try hard edgelordy. The groom definitely did his best to include the biggest, most obvious \"I'm using a thesaurus\" words in his, and talked a lot about cutting his heart out and giving it to her, and how he's happy to share the despair of the cold dead world with her, and all sorts of other bullshit.\n\nThe couple is honestly more crust-punk than goth, but think mid-Wisconsin crust punk. You know the type - move out of your parents at 17 and claim you were emancipated, live in a shit hole apartment not just because of income, but like, actively making it a shit hole.\n\nOverly aggressive crust punk girl, super \"tough\", wants to fight everyone for everything (she tried to pick 3 different fights on the night of the wedding).\n\nAnyway, I don't mention the income bullshit out of elitism. I mention it because the trashiness factor was impossible to ignore, and I feel like everyone knows one of these couples. One of those \"we've been through so much\" couples, who are either constantly fighting - not just with each other, but like, fighting everyone and everything all the time, quitting jobs because \"I won't put up with that bullshit!\" but it happens at EVERY job, forcing the other person to quit THEIR job for some ill conceived bullshit, just... all of it. We've all known this couple.\n\nAnyway, point being, they're the kind of couple whose engagement ring is a ring pop, who has their wedding on Friday the 13th, who wears black to the wedding, who gets a free wedding venue that's part of the haunted house they work at, who holds a goth themed wedding, and who just in general *needs* to try exactly this hard, and be exactly this edgy, ALL the time, at everything they do. So you could tell that this was just an idea that they had one day \"babe, what if we had a totally punk, goth wedding?\", and kinda just did it for funsies, because you know, fuck society, or whatever.\n\nThey had been together for a few years, and within 30 days from the wedding, they had split and the bride moved to Florida.",

I always saw this manager and the female that invited me to the wedding together. The manager was named Paco and he was a big funny cool guy. She and her fiance had a 2 year old kid together when I met them. Anyway, I'm at the wedding and it was pretty normal. I was a minor at the time and didn't drink so I just kind of sat there and was there. Anyway, the wedding took up a whole day. At the very end of the wedding day the bride asks me to drive her home (there was a plausible reason for it, but I can't remember anymore.) Anyway I dropped her off and as she got out of the car I was like...it's weird that she isn't really talking about the wedding or her husband much and it's weird I'm driving her home too. Anyway, a month later her and the manager are fired for talking ludely over the company phone to each other. I realize she originally wanted the manager to be one of the groomsmen and wanted him to drive her home. How it worked out was I was a \"safe dude that wouldn't try anything\" and her fiance said to pick me wtf. Anyway, I also realize that she had texted me stuff like \"I want to eat you up\" and stuff while on break and I just thought it was a weird joke I didn't get. She was leering at me (that's how I perceived it, she must have thought it was her \"I want you face\") when I looked up at her when I read the text. And at the time I just had no clue what that meant right. Anyway, I walked right on through that minefield lol. They stayed married...I think...and then the guy moved in with them...that's all I know about the situation, very weird.",

Night before the wedding he’s barking out orders over text about what time to pick him up, how early we needed to get started (“eco” friendly wedding which is pretty much short for cheap handmade decorations that looked awful cuz there was no effort put into it) putting up the decore and setting up chairs. All of which I had no clue we had to do ourselves as I was not told before that very moment. Show up to the guys apartment and he’s passed out. Door unlocked so we walked in and he’s just a drooling mess on the couch. We were shaking him for a good minute before he came to. You could light his breath on fire it reeked of alcohol. Watched him stumble into a pair of sweatpants and tennis shoes then swallow his PTSD meds with a swig from his flask full of Jameson whiskey. Once we get him back to life we load up 2 cars and make our way to the remote location of the wedding. The entire time drunky was barking at us to do shit correctly, stop dicking around, telling us that when we see his bride to not stare at her tits, accusing the only other guy he conned into being a groomsmen of wanting to be with his girl, stumble through a story about how he chased a bobcat through the location we were setting up for the wedding, occasionally burping while still swigging from his flask, all while he was chillin in his lawn chair. Getting more drunk by the second. At that point I was no longer doing it for him. I felt bad for his soon to be wife. When she arrived she praised the three of us with how well we decorated and he of course had to mention how he directed us knucklefucks to do shit properly cuz we can’t do anything right. The other groomsman and I got a rude fucking talking to by the brides father about “letting” him drunk before the wedding. Like buddy I’m on a hair trigger to stomp the fuck out right now so back the fuck up before I push you into one of these decorations made of hay. Groom was a sip away from totally falling over but he stumbled his way through the ceremony and slurred during his rehearsed vows and poor bride had to pretend for him about how nervous he must be. But she knew. Once the ceremony was over the biggest weight was lifted from my shoulders. I’d made it and he was no longer my responsibility. The marriage lasted a year and a half.",

The relationship took a downturn, but every time he mentioned taking a break, she guilted him by reminding him how she left her family to be with him. They went through the motions to get married, as it was expected by then and he felt obligated. They had their budget to work within, but the groom had a large Italian family who offered to cover the added expense of some additional guests they wanted to come. Reasonable, right? Not to the bride…she wanted an equal amount of guests added to her side and wanted the groom to figure out how to pay for it. When he said there was no way, she kicked in the side of his car. Then there was a snowstorm on the wedding day-they held the marriage ceremony but had to re-book and re-rent the tuxes, flowers etc. after a few years, she ended up sleeping with the neighbor, getting pregnant by him, and kicking the groom out of the house he was paying for without even his clothes claiming he was abusing her (he wasn’t). All very sad, and the signs were there. He was just a nice guy trying to do the right thing",

Everything associated with me being married pointed to disaster.\n\nOur wedding was on March 23rd if I remember right.  A couple of days before Valentines Day, Marlene, my soon to be mother-in-law, called me asked if had purchased a ring set yet.  I asked her for what.  She replied that I was getting married in a month.  It was news to me.\n\nThere is this song that is traditionally played after the newlyweds say their vows. I think it was the theme song for The Newlywed Game.  My in-laws had hired a DJ to do all the music for the wedding and the reception.  After we said our vows, we started to walk down the aisle.  As we were walking, the song hadn't played 2 bars when it started to slow down and stop.  Everyone laughed their asses off.  I looked at Valerie and said \"Bad sign\".\n\nUsually, the bride and groom leave the reception to take off and enjoy their honeymoon.  At some point, the guy who did the floral arrangements didn't think the party was lively enough so he dumped a few gallons of vodka in the punch bowls.  Valerie's best friend had brought her boyfriend with her.  Also, her mother had her best friend there.  The music was getting louder and then Val's friends boyfriend started to dance with her mom's best friend.  Next thing you know, they were on the floor peeling off their clothes and going at it on the middle of the dance floor while Val's best friend was standing there watching and crying.  As we walked the last few people to their cars and got others cabs, we ended up cleaning this huge mess that was left and when we got to our destination, we slept.\n\nMarlene had gone cheap on the catering and had the caterers cook at her house.  After the wedding, she told me me they made a huge mess out of her kitchen.  So, she stopped payment on their check.  \n\nI came home from work a few months later and turned on the tube.  I heard the theme song for The Peoples Court come on.  I heard them say today was the wedding fiesta fiasco.  I walked by the TV as they were introducing the plaintiff and the defendant.  It was Marlene, her husband Pat and poor Bob, the floral arranger.  I rushed and grabbed a video tape and recorded the episode.  I found out later they had all smoked a joint before going on, since Marlene's husband Pat was a big pothead.  Judge Wapner said something that made them all start laughing.  He got mad and told them not to laugh at him.  Since they were high, they couldn't stop laughing so they lost.  I showed the tape to Val and she flipped out that I had recorded it.\n\nAfter a year we were separating.  We had gone down to Del Mar to spend the weekend and told her that we should go to Mexico since we were so close and have some fun for the weekend.  She was excited.  We were in traffic going into TJ.  This kid came up to our car, spit all over the windshield and scrubbed it with a squeegee.  She went into panic mode and said \"I want to go home\".

Brother of the bride stood up and gave a nice impromptu speech about teamwork and having a partner to go through life with. How happy the family was to have the groom join their family. Best Man and Maid of Honor were divorced within a year. Couple who got married are still married 30+ years later. I sometimes wonder if the speeches actually were helpful in how not to act as a couple. \n\nFor me the complex backstory. Bride's brother is gay and has been in a longterm relationship for 40+ years. At the time he gave his speech about marriage he couldn't marry the man he loved and I think his passioned defense of marriage was born from that. When people would say they were against gay marriage because it makes a mockery of marriage I'd think of that night. The married couple who had no respect for marriage could easily marry (and did over and over again) and the man who stood up and defended marriage could not.

One sentence in one language. Translation into language #2. translation into language #3. sometimes even into #4. next sentence. \nI kid you not: the first speech already blew the complete schedule for dinner out of the window. There was a speech from, and I kid you not: her father, her mother, new spouse of I don’t remember whom, his father, some uncle or godfather or whatnot, some best man or girl, I don’t remember… this is really true: the speeches were finished far after midnight. Then there was time for roughly half an hour of dancing. \n\nThey were deeply frustrated with the whole thing but didn’t want to hurt any of the speakers and so it just continued…\nWhich goes to show that you really REALLY should appoint someone to be the master of schedule and ceremony and explicitly grant the authority to prevent certain relatives from doing certain things… \n\nIt somewhat breaks my heart when I think back to it.

The boys joined our rpg group and I guess we ended up being the go between home... they didn't want yo live with parents but were not ready to be really on their own. Js in parents accredited my husband and I for J finishing school even). So we go to wedding, reception is at the legion hall, ķside nit, that was a surprise to ne cause neither C or M had any association with the American legion,  but I did... my dad's picture is on our posts wall as a past comander. Which fave ne something to do with my 11 year old ... the post has a new convention room they rent out... it was funny cause I took ny kid into the nail building to show my daughter the place I practically grew up and the car tender got rude with ne only gor one of the old timers Jonny, to read her the riot act and her to spend the rest of the night trying to apologize to me...) and how,  it's time yo toast and C gets his glass of juice (they were not old enough for booze, yet had their reception at what is essentially a bar, lol). C gets up to toast and thank everyone for coming to their infestation... not a joke or miss type there. My husbandooks at him and asked, \"are we going to need a shot ir a flea bath or what?\"...\nSo, M gets knocked up, like  you do, baby born, M is constantly ay our place with J... C joined military to provide for M n baby, and first night in kilked himself, body never released to M and we didn't get a funeral.  No idea what happened there but some like to think the military helped him pretend to die to get away from M. We know its a bs hope, but hey, we lived the kid. M ended up married to J who adored the baby. J and M also had a baby and J lived being a husband and dad. Until the day, fathers day at that, that M cones home with her new guy, J knew Nothing about, kicked him out of his home so new guy could move in. Limited his time with 2 kids he took care of all their lives... yup, I should of ground my heals in and told C I forbid him dating her or something like that. I know it wouldn't of stopped events but maybe I'd feel like I tried or maybe when he was feeling tgat low ge would of gone home to us instof dying.",

Thought guest was going to murder me with words before the day of the wedding ever came.\n\nI invited an online friend that I hadn’t ever met in person (but had talked to/video chatted with for years) to my sisters wedding in June. (Yeah, I know, I’d read tons of stories about the random person at the wedding who screws it up, and still went ahead and did it anyway. We’ll talk about that in a bit.)\n\nShe flew in a day earlier than we had planned- not that I’m complaining, it just threw all my plans out the window, and I spent most of the weekend feeling completely off-kilter. Originally, she was flying in on Thursday evening. I was going to work until noon on Thursday, get my hair cut, pick up my tux, and pick her up at the airport, then it was off to the hotel. She messaged me Wednesday morning, saying she was on her way to the airport and would update me in a bit. I texted back, confused, saying I thought her flight was tomorrow. She messaged back that she had gotten the days wrong, and we decided to see if she could switch the tickets and come a day early. Well, she did. It was a little extra $$$, but I didn’t care, because hey, I really *really* like this girl, and I won’t complain about any extra time spent with her. So, I call and rent a hotel room for the night close to work, fully intending to work the half day I had told my boss I would, and then head to the hotel near the wedding venue afterwards. I head to the airport after work, hastily stopping and cleaning myself up/grabbing the bag I had packed, and my costume for the rehearsal dinner. I get there around 8p.m., and her flight doesn’t get in until around 10p.m., so, I wait.. and wait, and wait some more at the -small “international” airport- that she was originally flying into, which was an hour north from the hotel we were headed to for the evening. I get a call, “My one flight was delayed and I missed my connecting. They want to send me to -airport that is another hour north of where you are. Is that ok?” “Yeah. I’ll be there.” “Ok, it’ll be another two hours until I touch down there.” So.. I wait for her original flight to land, hoping I can at least grab her bag. Well, (duh), I can’t. So, I trundle north another hour, pick her up, (finally), and let this woman, who I’ve only just met in person, drive my brand new truck. And I do mean new. Normally I would have been freaking out, but I trust her, and she did great. She’s one of the few people I would trust to drive my truck.\n\nSo.. we get to the hotel at like 1 or 2 a.m. I’m supposed to be to work, so I halfheartedly set an alarm, we get into bed.. And I totally don’t wake up to my alarm because it was set to silent, so I sleep until 10. At this point, I don’t care about work, and we head out to get my tuxedo and her checked bag. We drive back to -small “international” airport-, and they tell us, “Oh sorry, we sent that back to -gigantic international airport- this morning, and it’s now in -bigger regional airport where you picked her up last night.-“ So.. we drove back up there, and finally got her bag. Then we had to go and get my tux in a completely different town; one that would have made more sense if I was picking it up on my own, but again.. SNAFU.\n\nNow, I’m sure you’re wondering.. “Where’s the ‘not going to last’ moment?” Well, that was us, in the truck, getting closer and closer to the hotel where we’ll be spending the next few days, when my idiot brain means I miss my weird exit-thing off the interstate (it looked like a service road intersecting an on/off ramp), and I ended up giving us what felt like another 30-ish miles on the turnpike, since there wasn’t anywhere (or any way) to turn around. I thought for sure she was going to kill me- not because she’s violent or anything, far from it.. I just felt like absolute crap right then- we’d been on the road/in airports/in stores for close to 8 hours already just that day, and I felt absolutely horrible. Good news, though: we did eventually make it to the hotel, she didn’t kill me (allegedly), and the entire wedding/ceremony went off pretty much without a hitch. She was the perfect guest, as far as I’m concerned. My family all likes her an awful lot now, and she even helped my mom when my mom got a bit too warm outside.\n\nI could go into detail on the afterwards, but what’s the fun in that? You don’t want to hear about the fiasco while trying to get her home, I’m sure..",

They then started the process of adopting a child. (Every time I met him alarm bells go off) \n\nA month after they finalize adoption of their child, she filed for divorce... Come to find out he had a raging temper, bad heroin addiction and major gambling debts. He was in so deep he was starting to try and sell art and stuff from the house sneakily. \n\nMy husband thinks it was my fight or flight response kicking in every time I met him. He was very large (I was tiny 5'1\" 130lbs he's maybe 6'4\" 260 lbs). He was very argumentative and competitive. \n\nIt bothers me I never said anything to her.",

About 10 minutes later, after the bride is completely tore up, the best man admits it was a joke. I’m still not entirely sure it was a joke but the groom at least got it together before the ceremony. During the ceremony, the groom kept his sunglasses on the entire time even with requests to take them off so if there was a reaction to seeing her walk down the aisle for the first time, it did not translate in the photos. He wouldn’t cooperate when taking the bride and grooms photos but loved being in the funny photos with his groomsmen.

Long story incoming.\n\nOne of my best friends (We'll call him Clay) was getting married and it was not a good situation.  He's a really kind-hearted guy but unfortunately, she took that as \"easy to manipulate\", and she (we'll call her Whine) complained about *everything*.  \n\nI could go into stories about how we got him a ticket to a major sporting event, she wanted to go, we didn't have any other tickets, so she tried to guilt him out of going because \"he'll be there having fun and she'll be sad and alone at home.\"  Or the numerous times she tried to force a \"joint bachelor/bachelorette party\" to which all of us said, \"fuck no.\"  Or the fact that she invited herself to join one night we were playing games, spent half of it in the other room by herself, and then came around the corner *in my own house* and yelled \"SHUSH!\"  She literally forced him to bring her, then complained the whole time about how loud we were being.  \n\nStill, it's the night before and the wedding itself that stands out.  I already was considering talking him out of marrying her after she was being rude to him at the rehearsal dinner, and we found out she snapped at his grandmother for no good reason at all.  Clay's grandmother is the kind of woman that would bake you a pie and then talk shit.  You don't fuck with her, she's the best.  \n\nWhine was pushing me to say where we were going for his bachelor party (at that point, an escape room and a bar...he didn't want to go anywhere that may upset Whine) and we realized it wasn't because she was being friendly and curious, she was trying to go too.  Hell no.  Went outside to smoke, trying to figure out how to be the bad guy that says \"please don't marry this woman\" and a long time friend of mine walks out.  Then another.  Another.  We're all really uncomfortable about the situation, smoking, drinking our beers.  Another friend comes out and it gets quiet for a second, before he just drops the bomb.  \"So...Clay shouldn't be getting married, right?\"\n\nIt got to a point that Clay's mom came out, we shut up, and she even dropped on us that she wasn't for the marriage.  Offered to give us however much money we need \"if we can make sure Clay doesn't show up for the wedding tomorrow\".  We tried.  Went to the bachelor party and suddenly Whine is texting and messaging all of us, trying to manipulate info out of anyone that she could.  We realize she's doing this and make a decision to turn our phones off.  Meanwhile, one of our friends who was helping her with her bachelorette party said she was going ballistic because she \"didn't know where Clay was\" and \"wanted to join us\" and \"it was supposed to be a joint thing\".  We haven't even gotten to the bar, we were in the Escape Room.  We had taken Clay's phone and she sent endless amounts of messages demanding to know where he was, said she cancelled her party because she was so upset, and he needed to come back.\n\nWe spent all night trying our best to talk him out of it, all the way into the next morning.  When we found out Clay showed up to get ready, we decided if he was going down, we weren't letting him do it alone.  One last conversation with the groomsmen and he was ready to walk.  His mom pulled the car up to the door outside the dressing room.  Family and friends all were watching to see how this would go...and his dad walks in and goes \"Hey bud, why not go through with it and if you decide it's not for you, you can always get it annulled.\"  I have never seen a murderer born in a moment but the look on his mom's face was probably as close as I was going to get.  We literally had every groomsman and even some of the bridesmaids saying \"don't do this\".  Family was begging him not to do it, but he didn't want to hurt her.  So we went out for the wedding, and she was shaking.  We thought it was wedding jitters, which would make sense.  Nope.\n\nShe stopped shaking when the \"if anyone objects to this marriage, speak now or forever hold your peace\" line was dropped and no one spoke up.  I think she thought (rightfully) that someone would object.  She immediately became calm...scary calm, like watching a murderer get a not guilty verdict.  But when the pastor continued, you could tell where the family and close friends were in the audience by the deep sighs of disappointment.  She spent the rest of the wedding giving him shit for the night before, making him feel guilty for not coming home because she \"needed him\", so on.  We thought he was stuck for life because if all this didn't stop it, nothing would, but he thankfully was just done with it all after about a year or so because people stopped inviting him to things, and when they did, he spent most of the time embarrassed by her actions.\n\nI've never seen so many people object to a wedding though, and while so many of us wished it didn't last at all, the night before and day of were some of the craziest red flags against a marriage that I had ever seen.",

As it ate my hair up to my ears I realized there was no way to get my hair out that beast . Tik tock tic tock my home phone is ringing my big brick phone is ringing so I grabbed the scissors and my wedding pictures well the palest guy you ever saw with a simply red haircut and a whole bunch of wedding guests lookin at me like they didn’t understand the statement I was trying to make. The video is even better we were married outside at this little church that was next door to the mall and the captain funtastik carnival was in full carnival form and while we were saying our vowes on the video you can hear perfectly “ dirty dead’s done dirt cheap” and all of the blood curdling screams of the people on the rides . I took it as a sign.",

True enough, they divorced a year later. \n\nIt was a BIG wedding. She was a bridezilla, I was actually ripped off as well, which led me to ask for full payment BEFORE the weddings from then on. But the things in particular: \n\nI was tasked to edit the grooms bachelor party video. It had… a lot of material I couldn’t really put on it. But lets just say that he seemed like a bit of a jerk. \n\nDuring the wedding I also filmed messages for the couple and many of them were quite sarcastic, mean or laced with bitchy comments. Even the guests didn’t seem to like them very much. \n\nBridezilla wanted me to make her wedding video into a six hour epic. I had agreed to the gig with making a 45 minute video. But she had changed her mind, she wanted ALL the footage, edited, color corrected and mixed with a selection of music of her choosing. And the songs she picked were just weird… Lady in Red, It’s a Perfect Day, and I’m not fucking kidding, You’re so Vain. I asked her was she sure, cause the songs aren’t really NICE songs. She got angry and demanded them in there. So yep… It’s a Perfect Day plays as she walks down the aisle, Lady in Red is their wedding dance, with You’re so Vain rounding out the video with an elaborate montage of all the best parts.\n\nIt was a fucking weird project to work on… Well, until I was hired to do the Australian gig….

It was for a lesbian couple, both worked under my wife in the same company for years. One of them was noticeably out of her mind crazy, and I couldn't stand her. The other was pretty chill!\n\nI had chosen to not attend, even though I was invited, simply because I cannot for the life of me stand the one bride. I mean.. shes bad. Like, the kinda person you can't be within 10 feet of for more than a minute without losing your mind. \n\nWell, the wedding was being held at the crazy brides mothers house. A HUGE 10 bedroom, disgustingly large house. \n\nThey of course invited their closest friends, 5-6 of them, most from the same office to come over and hang a few hours before the wedding was to take place. So they all showed up, including my wife, the maid of honor, 4 hours before the ceremony.\n\nWell! None of them came dressed up! Including my wife. So an hour or two before things were to begin, they all decided to go get dressed up, and the mother DEMANDS they all leave and go elsewhere to do it, as it would somehow be unlucky for them to dress up in the same house as the brides???! And the bride of the crazy mother says nothing. Deer in headlights kinda look on her face. \n\nAll of them being an hour or more from home, all ended up getting dressed up and doing their makeup in a 711 BATHROOM. switching out with customers, as it was a single room. She told me it was beyond embarrassing. \n\nThen, to make things worse, the mother demand that my wife, their maid of honor, not be standing near them while they were saying their vows, but rather.... pulled up an extra chair into the room.. at the very back, behind the guests.. where she was to stay seated for the entire ceremony. \n\nI was LIVID! A lot of my own money went into decorating 'n whatnot. As well as a nice expensive gift! Ack!\n\nMy wife ended up making the nearly 2 hour drive home later that evening, crying the entire way.\n\nIn the end, they moved in together December of 2019, right after getting married. With covid, they were house bound and couldn't escape one another. They divorced in August of last year, after hardly 11 months. The really cool one of the two brides ended it, saying they were better as friends than lovers. That the other was \"insufferable\"",

I'm pretty sure my classmate was freaking out at every moment pleasing him while making it seem like she's too cool for this too. \n\nAnd yeah he turned abusive and isn't helping with the kids at all. But \"fortunately\", he isn't abusive enough for her to divorce him. Indian society doesn't really favor divorces and her parents are basically telling her to adjust and they'll help raise the kid. So, yeah not a marriage that'll end, but will be a sad affair until she's brave enough to end it.",

He was from the west coast and I was from the Midwest, and really the only thing we had in common was that we were both desperately emotionally lonely, single, and of the same religious background. \n\nFor some dumbass reason he asked me to marry him about 2 months later while I was still in training but he was on his way to deploy. And I said yes because I was 19 and had my head up my ass.\n\nSo he heads out across the Atlantic and I wait for my orders to come through. They are sending me to San Diego. I get to San Diego, his deployment ends, and he hops on a plane. \n\nHis family has a friend that can officiate weddings nearby. We decide to do it. Got the dress at a second hand prom dress store, got married in a backyard, didn't have any family or anyone I even knew in attendance. No music, awful vows written by the officiant, and I ended up putting the ring on the wrong hand. Got married on St. Patrick's Day, so for dinner I just had a little bit of corned beef and a shitload of alcohol. As soon as we were done with vows I said, \"I need a beer.\"\n\nWe rented a car and headed north to spend our \"honeymoon\" at his mother's place on an island. That part wasn't too bad.

            "text": "I saw two weddings that were so sad.\n\nI was at one wedding where the father of the bride thought it was funny to joke about the bride's promiscuity during his toast speech.  After telling many stories about the bride's extreme dating (she was really young too), he proceeded to make jokes about the extremely short period of time the couple knew each other before the engagement AND the actual wedding date. It was barely three months and they were getting married. The guests next to me explained that none of it was hyperbole. I was not sure if the bride or the father was the source of the problem because the whole thing was so bizarre. I knew there was no way the groom could go home feeling special or confident about his decision to get married. I felt so sorry for them both. They were married for less than 6 months after. \n\nAt another wedding, the officiant chose to give a personal backstory about the couple during the reception speech. During the story, he discussed how he had to give the couple marriage counseling for months before the wedding because the bride tried to back out. They knew each other for a short period of time in real life because they met and got engaged over the internet. Anyone who gives marriage counseling should not discuss it. It was really bad judgment. I saw the bride in the bathroom and I could tell she wanted to bolt right at the ceremony. That was also a short marriage.\n\nThis is why I hate weddings.  There are few weddings where the family is well enough behaved that nothing goes crazy or wrong (unless you are not paying attention). Everyone is stressed about making an ordinary relationship binding and we are supposed to act like we have no doubts while we eat food and drink alcohol. Even if the wedding is awesome it has no bearing on the likelihood the marriage will last.",

            "text": "The friends and wedding guests did not actually find out for a few months about this major red flag at the wedding ceremony. But it was no surprise when we did find out.\n\nAs the bride was about to walk up the aisle, her father standing beside her was saying \"Honey, you do not have to do this. We can leave right now, we'll just get in the car and go. This is not a good guy, you know he has serious issues, this wedding is a mistake, let's just go.\" \n\nHer two brothers were also right there (as ushers, the groom only allowed one groomsman & bridesmaid) and were saying in full-hearted support \"Sister-Name let's leave, let's go, the car is right here, let's just go.\"\n\nThe bride, a dear friend, told me later that she would have left the church with them, but she looked into the church and felt that she could not leave us all just sitting there. She had to go through with the wedding. \n\nEveryone who heard about this later told her that we would have all been happy had she stood up the groom at the altar.\n\nThe surprise was not that the marriage broke up, but that they dragged on with it for 5 years (no children thank goodness). On the day of the wedding, I think most of us would have guessed less than a year.\n\nProbably another sign of doom was that almost no one showed up to the wedding & reception from the groom's side. I don't think he invited anyone.\n\nHe was from out of town and had made few friends in town, other than the bride. A couple of his employees showed up and that was all.\n\nA few of the bride's friends decided to sit on the groom's side of the church just so it didn't look so awkward. But most of the bride's friends didn't like the groom and didn't care how his empty his side looked.\n\nThe groom did his best to ruin the reception by being pissy and awkward in an attention-seeking way. Nothing suited him, he paid little attention to the bride and spent most of the time complaining about minor details. And implying that others did things poorly (it was mostly a DIY reception). The guests were doing their best to ignore his babyish behavior and keep it upbeat.\n\nThen he wanted them to leave the reception as soon as they could. But when the new husband saw that some of the bride's friends had 'decorated' his car (not much, just some shoe polish and cans on strings that were easily removed), he lost his temper for good. He at least didn't verbalize his anger, but instead stomped around and huffed and scowled and did not say goodbye to anyone. The bride said later that they drove straight to the DIY car wash and it took less than 10 minutes to return the car to normal. She was still in her wedding dress, helping.\n\nShe really tried to make the marriage work. For his part, he was cheating on her before and after the wedding. Why he ever asked her to marry him, and then went through with it, and then waited 5 years to end it, is a mystery I never tried to solve. She has a lot of theories, though.\n\nWhile they were married the husband complained about his wife to everyone who would listen, telling them \"Her family forced me to marry her.\" \n\nHe never explained how her family did that. Or why. She wasn't pregnant, they never had children.\n\nOf course once people heard that his father-in-law tried to get the bride to walk out on the wedding at the foot of the aisle, the groom's story that he was \"forced\" to marry her was pretty ridiculous.",

Somewhere around 2009.\n\nIt was cool to see my mom being happy in her dress and all in the morning and the wedding wasn’t as disastrous as most of the ones being told in this thread but anyway. Everyone arrives, 90% of the guests are from my father and are already getting wasted. It’s not my best day, i’m annoyed because i find my hairstyle and my clothes ridiculous and the guests laugh at me for being chosen as the flowerboy. Some of the guests didn’t like kids and looked at me and my brother as if we have the plague when my mom introduced us to them, while some other are getting all up in our faces and asking the photographers to take akward pics of us, me in particular as the annoyed flowerboy.\n\nAfternoon comes, my mom is already getting bored while my father is gone getting wasted with his brothers and friends and i have to stay with her and listen to her bored chats with the guests while my brother was off to have a horse-drawn carriage ride in the park with our grandpa.\n\nThe ceremony comes, my father, drunk, grabs my mom to give her a big sloppy kiss during the kiss and the guests shout at me to pick up the flower petals on the ground to throw them at them for some solid minutes, and during their dance he’s so wasted and red like a tomato and accidentally burries his face in my mom’s half revealed chest in front of their families. The evening comes, they’re already apart from each other and my mom is looking like the excluded kid at a school party, my drunk uncles argue out loud non-stop over small things, my drunk aunts cry crocodile tears for this « beautiful event » and my little cousins are playing unsupervised wild games resulting in them getting grounded because one of them ran into a wall corner during a game of tag and ended up crying with bandaids on his face. My father is nowhere to be seen but rumors is he’s getting wasted again in the next city.\n\nThe most fun part of the wedding was when my older childhood best friend, who was invited because her father is a friend of my father, sneaked out with me and broke into the park at night before we went back in my house to have a sleepover and watch cartoons. My mom came back a few moments later with my brother because she was already having enough and she made us snacks.\n\nWell you guessed it, me and my brother spent the rest of our childhood with a toxic father and an unhappy mother constantly fighting and reminding us at the dinner table they’re only staying for financial matter and for us and waiting for me to move out to officialize the divorce.\n\nMy father never had a great relationship with weddings anyway, he’s homophobic and later on turned down an invitation from his friend to his wedding because he was marrying a man. He kept fantasizing about attending my brother’s future wedding with a « beautiful white christian girl who would give him grandchildren and keep the family’s legacy » (my brother is the eldest).\nIrony of the situation, my brother recently came out as gay and, due to personal reasons after my father got mad at this and decided to place his last hopes on me, i’ve been hiding my bisexuality and my relationship with my boyfriend for a while now. My boyfriend keeps dreaming of a happy marriage for us and i wanna make sure to give it to him in the near future.",

Their story begins two-years earlier in early 1990.  Mutual friend Anne (although K and S did not know each other) was writing to Ken (who was a Marine Corpsman at Camp Lejeune). S wondered who Anne was writing to and Anne gave S K's address and she started to write to K.  They continued to correspond even when K gets deployed to Desert Shield/Storm for seven months.\n\nAfter getting back in spring of 1991, K transfers to new duty station. Taking leave enroute, K and S go on first actual date.  Said date wasn't totally bad or good.  Apparently, though, S's mom had been married to a marine who was also a Vietnam Veteran who suffered some serious PTSD and was very abusive.  This, of course, translated to her mom and grandfather (her mom's father) being very leary of K, since he was also in the military.  In addition, S's brother J tried his hardest to keep them apart.  Only grandma (her mom's mother), who actually ran the family saw the potential and told everyone else to back off.\n\nNeedless to say, the corresponding continued along with phone calls and visits enabled K and S to grow closer as a couple.  Her brother even had their home phone disconnected to prevent the calls.\n\nEven through all of this, the coupld did get engaged and instead of planning a wedding, they decided to elope.  One of K's co-workers acted as the MOH, Best Man, photographer, and witness.  They were married at the base chapel by the Navy Chaplain who was also a Vietname Veteran and also a marine.  Also, S's brother J predicted, to the couple, their marriage would only last six months (interesting so far eh?).\n\nAfter they got married, K and S agreed to co-sign for a loan for the co-worker.  Come to fine out, co-worker was embezzeling from their company.  Unfortunately, co-worker committed suicide so K and S had to replay said loan.  Finally, after all the above, things settled down and K and S got to move to many different places (since K still had 12 years left in the navy until retirement).  Later on, grandpa actually apologized when he realized the marriage was going to last and even the brother came around (although K would rub it in every anniversary about how many six month periods have passed).\n\nNeedless to say, S and myself have just celebrated their 29th anniversary and are still going strong as ever.\n\nCongrats on making it through.\n\nTLDR: Couple with every negative: military, family against, long distance courtship, eloped, witness later committed suicide and stuck couple with co-signed loan.  Constant travel due to military but couple is now celebrating 29 years of happiness",

(referring to his son) text me the club and ill be there in half an hour. holy shit man im gonna be so plastered\". he came back at like 2 am drunk as shit and COVERED in glitter. we all knew what happened and im sure the bride did as well but she just ignored it. flash forward, they are engaged, im a bridesmaid and \"they\" are throwing a pre wedding bbq in a forest, it wouldve been fun and cute if the groom didnt completely ditch buying the actual grills in favor of getting a bunch of beer. we had a bunch of meat, fruit and veggies sitting in freezers in the blazing summer with no grill, no knives, no plates, no forks, nothing except a lot of beer. the bride's dad needed to rush and get the grills while the groom was already vomiting next to a tree in front of his 8 year old son. we managed to still have fun but the gossip was already happening and people started taking bets on how long the marriage would last. a day later the wedding is happening. the vows were fine not much happened except the groom being late. now, if i said everything that happened at that party id be here the whole day so ill just say some highlights. the brides best friend pretended to have called ice on my dad and the grooms family, the bride and groom were fighting BADLY behind the porta potty, a cook at the wedding started accusing the groom of groping her and telling her to meet him later, a baby was left in the middle of the road by i believe the grooms cousin then the bride comes and saves the baby from an incoming car to which the babies mother comes out of the car and started punching the bride, groom was passing out at the bar, groom was just being handed alchohol by his friends and ended up vomiting on the bride, groom passed out in the middle of the first dance and ended up swearing at the bride, the groom hates my family so he was the one who scheduled the wedding on my bday so i needed to cancel everything, the bride was crying after the wedding, and last but not least, it was revealed the groom was hooking up with a 19 year old in the back of his friends car. im sad to say they are currently together and just had their first kid but the bride is super depressed and barely talks anymore.",

That turned into a shit show. He then said that he was going to marry a woman he had met 10 days ago. He made a big deal out of telling us, that he never had sex with this woman, but that he was just so in love with her. My grandmother cried, he's ex wife cried, the whole family was mad.\n\nFast forward to the wedding. Neither me nor my brother was invited. My uncle has only invited his mom, my mom, their sister and their older brother, but had invited all of the brides family. Yep, my uncle hadn't invited his three children, because they were against the wedding. It was a pure shit show. My family wasn't allowed into the church either, which meant that my family only was there for the dinner afterwards.\n\nThere was no cake, because the bride didn't want any sugar. Instead there was small bowls of candy here and there. That and people was only given one glas of wine. At one point my uncle started pouring wine up to himself, without giving any to anyone else.\n\nNo one was introduced to anyone. My family had no idea who was the parents of the bride, nor who was her children.\n\nThen came the brides speech to my uncle. She talked about how long they had been together, and gav him a big painting with the date of their first date. My grandmother almost flipped the table. It was dated all the way back to a week before my uncle went on a romantic trip with his ex wife. My uncle had been cheating on his ex for several months.\n\nThe wedding was two years ago. In that time my uncle has lost contact with his two oldest children, and his youngest with development issues has made it clear that she doesn't like his wife. It has also gotten pretty clear that the new wife is a gold digger.
