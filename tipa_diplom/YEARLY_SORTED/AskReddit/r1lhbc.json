I‚Äôd like to clarify what I meant: sometimes the most grounded viewpoints aren‚Äôt always the most popular. Abraham Lincoln was not popular in the South. Martin Luther King Jr. certainly wasn‚Äôt always popular (among the whites, and I think they were the majority). If I have my history correct, John Adams defended the soldiers in the Boston Massacre even though it was frowned upon and he proved that they likely fired in self defense, something not a lot of people were willing to consider because they were so angry about the event. Jordan Peterson fought against compelled speech in Canada, even though he was not always popular for it and wa s labeled as a transphobic. Albert Einstein was famously not liked by his professors lol. People that face discrimination when pursuing their goals are obviously disliked and singled out a lot, but I admire their intelligence and integrity for figuring out how to navigate that and to find their voices anyways, despite their disadvantages. Ruth Bader Ginsburg when she was younger is an example, obviously as well as a lot of people today. \n\nIn my class discussions, the mood always changes when someone briefly suggests that men and women can often be psychologically different, not all feelings deserve to be validated, people don‚Äôt have to use pronouns, etc. And the same thing happens when I suggest to my family that global warming and white privilege are real, and that vaccine mandates protect those genetically vulnerable to the virus from other people‚Äôs pride, etc. but they can‚Äôt factually rebut or control me. \n\nAs for fictional characters: Rhett Butler and Atticus Finch were not popular, but they were often the smartest in the room when it came to certain issues.\n\nObviously this isn‚Äôt always the case. Sometimes the person really is disliked for good reasons. But other times, it takes an extremely level-headed person to see through his own assumptions and feelings and to focus on their passion for finding what the truth actually is rather than what they (and others) want it to be, and also to avoid conformity when what people are conforming to are unethical or nonsensical. Much less people are able to do that than those that can. Thinking a certain way because it makes you feel good and safe and because everyone else does is definitely not smart.",

Some issues he knows how to fix.  Some issues he leaves with experts.  He knows his limitations. (that's intelligent right there)\n\nHe also knows building codes and can do pretty much anything in our home, including: electrical, plumbing and structural codes. Everything is up to code, in the house he bought a year before we met.\n\nHe's built 3 computers since I met him 6 years ago, including the one I'm currently using. He understands RAM and ROM and all sorts of other terms that I can't keep in my head, that are computer related. He knows exactly what's needed to make the computer work properly and how to get the most out of every machine.\n\nHis friends call him for advice about anything they want to fix or change in their homes, as he knows the answers and can explain it to them in a way that they can understand. If they're working on a project, he'll drop everything, especially if he thinks they're in over their head, to help them.  \n\n\n  \nThere are a few things he can't do, like painting- so he hires people for those things.\n\nHe can't spell worth a damn!  Not even his siblings names. Whenever he's using a computer, I often get called into whatever room he's in, just to spell a word or two and/or to help him find something on whatever page he's trying to read on the computer.\n\nOTOH, I can spell. That's my super power. I can also knit, embroider and crotchet, but haven't in years.\n\nI'd have to say of the 2 of us, he's the intelligent one. Because of how he looks and acts, people underestimate him all the time, until they get to know him.    \nThere's really not much he can't do, and do well, including cooking!",

So I'm just gonna go over some stuff I've noticed about myself.\nIm really passive. Compared to other people my age, im 16, im very passive even when im irritated. I usually try to solve things with diplomacy rather than brute force.\nI often remember really weird facts about people that I think will come in handy later. For example, maybe a friends birthday, or maybe a certain secret of someone's they wouldn't want getting out.\nI find that I often use logic before emotion. If I see something many would cry or be disgusted at, I usually am the only one who just doesn't have a reaction to it. It may be just personal though considering my early childhood was filled with quite a bit of death and trauma, idk.\nI quite often dumb myself down quite a bit. I understand people don't exactly want to hang out with the smart guy all the time, and I dont think acting that way is very fun, so I often act goofy, aloof, and silly when im around other people.\nI... I kinda have a superiority complex. I dont like it, but its a bit of a subconscious thing.\nI often shut up and listen and am willing to admit I was wrong about something.\nAnd I really hate it when my intelligence is questioned or im treated like an idiot. Its the only thing that makes me wanna sock someone in the face.\n\nEdit: By the way, somethings I would like to clarify include the following. Instead of saying I have a superiority complex, an inflated ego would have been better.\nAlso, please stop egging me on, OP asked for signs of an intelligent person, so I gave some things that I've noticed and the people around me have about myself.

They are also comfortable rushing into uncharted mental trails. But, they cannot carry \"big\" ideas and have a real hard time bringing someone else along for their mental ride (cannot explain, teach or help). They are quick or witty but cannot really solve anything for anyone else - memory storage is shite.\n\nSome people have minds like semi/tandem trucks - they are not going to solve problems quickly and if they try to go off the scripted thought-path they are going to get stuck. But, they can move huge ideas and when set to a well-defined path they get big shit done. They can handle a huge load of information and make it work to a specific task. Also good at collecting and holding information and might have *anything* (facts/thoughts) carried around when needed.\n\nSome people have minds like sports cars - they are flashy and can rev their engine and go really fast, but only around a preset track. They can ramble off any stat from whatever they are focused/fascinated on and might be fast at solving math or problems from point A to B...when it's a straight line (that anyone will eventually get to, just not as fast). Medium to low storage. But, cocky and able to sell their thoughts and fast thinking as if it's the best thing out there. \n\nSome people have minds like heavy strip-mining dredges - and these are the research scientists / investigative journalists or any other profession who have take on massive information and workload, entire mountains, and over time reduce a mountain to rumble while sifting through it for gold. Not flashly, or fast, or user-friendly, but they are able to navigate anywhere they want to go and will mentally obliterate anything in their path. Make their own path and even build new roads that others can follow. Most are large enough mentally to carry others along for the ride, but they are totally work-task oriented and anyone not there to destroy a mountain wants to get the fuck off as soon as it's safe. When asked to travel down a regular mental highway, they often need assistance and no-one has a good time.\n\nSome people have minds like buses - many good teachers have minds like this and are able to accommodate a lot of people and able to take them for a ride and able to arrive at a destination. Requires patience and able to slow down, stop, and pick people up. Huge storage of mental facts but not fast or nimble. Cannot handle going off the scripted path. \n\nSome people have minds like quads - excels at exploring and mapping out new ideas, can do a bit of work while their are there and can lead others into uncharted territory, but they seem totally out of place and have trouble keeping up when asked to travel along the 'regular' mental highways. Great at creative problem solving but total shite at standardized testing, memorization, or routine.\n\nMost people have basic SUVs that can go fast when they feel safe, usually along pre-set mental routes, can carry a few people along and explain an idea, have enough storage to manage everyday life (memory or facts), and capable of some off-road exploration. Some are more reliable than others but overall can generally get where they need to go. Asking them to carry really big ideas and they will need multiple trips and can only handle it when broken down into smaller loads.",

Not the best at it sure, but compared to my peers I'm generally pretty quick on the uptake whenever someone's mood changes or understanding why certain emotions are being felt in both myself and others. By pinpointing the root of the emotional problem, I can offer practical solutions that can help make everyone feel better. However, I'm an absolute clown academically; particularly with math. I'm capable of learning math concepts, but they very rarely stick with me past the basics. I can also be a terrible listener, not because I'm not trying, but because I can have a hard time understanding some concepts without visual examples. Because of that, people get along well with me, but they won't rely on me for anything important and sometimes view me as niave or an airhead.\n\nI married someone who is the total opposite in this sense. Academically he is very intelligent, and is extremely capable of learning complicated concepts, math, and sciences with ease. It doesn't take much explaining of most subjects for him to understand what you're talking about, and is pretty well read in general. Despite that, he's an emotionally void bafoon. He understands his own emotions (for the most part), but has a hard time relating to and understanding other people. Man just can't read a room unless it's an actual emergency, and to top it off he's just a naturally abrasive person; so he ends up coming off more malicious and dickish than he actually is. He keeps his word, so other people rely on him, but very few would consider him a friend.\n\nIntelligent people understand that it isn't a while concept unto itself, and that just because someone is stupid in one area, doesn't make them stupid in general. I believe most of the population is pretty intelligent, just in different subjects and ways not many would consider or even expect.

Not overthinking, per se, but for years I've spent most of my days in thought. Very little I haven't thought of when it comes to my life and the things around it. So very rarely does someone say something in a way that I haven't thought of. A very common phrase of mine is, \"I've thought about that.\" I don't say it to sound cool or smart, just to indicate that whatever the person's idea is, is something that I've already pondered.\n\nOn occasion, somebody will say something that puts me on my ass or stops me in my tracks. Whether it's something so simple as saying something in a new way, or having a new idea altogether, and it's a surprise, so they immediately gain respect in my eyes, because this surprise indicates to me that they're thinking in terms far above the ways I've thought or the quality or quantity of thought.\n\nI understand that people have different perspectives, but we're all speaking English, which means that perspectives are railroaded into a very limited set of words, sentences, and conversations based on contexts; which, in turn, leads to many people saying semi-similar things, which tend also to align with my own thoughts.

Many people who aren't book smart, but are still intelligent have raw mechanical intuition or prowess, and can quickly see all the parts of a task. A very basic example of this might be a kid who is shown how to sweep, and on top of properly sweeping they move the furniture out of the way because they realize the dust flies behind a desk. They are able to take risks with a new activity because they understand how it works even before participating. For example someone taking something they have never used before apart to fix it because they quickly gather that taking it apart doesnt break it, and can be undone.\n\nFor an idea or a new subject, I would be looking for something like quickly using proper jargon, or asking questions beyond what was initially given. A very basic example might be separately teaching a kid multiplication and division and he immediately reaches the conclusion that division is just backwards multiplication. \n\nI realize that IQ tests are controversial, but they are designed to test one's learning prowess and intuition, not sheer knowledge. Language aptitude tests use complete gibberish, and test to see if you recognize a pattern and are able to form educated guesses on how you can continue the pattern and apply it.",

Many of us would say upon a failure, \"well that didn't work, I'll just try it again.\" Which persistence is fine, but it's the truly smart people who stop at the failure and ask, \"but why did it fail?\" They actually see problems differently.\n\nLike the discovery of penicillin, Alexander Fleming was studying the spread of the influenza virus, and was running an experiment involving a staphylococcus culture. He came back from a two week vacation to find his culture had been contaminated with mold. Most normal people at that point works have said, whoops, guess I'd better just run that experiment again, and toss the moldy sample. But Fleming looked closer, he wanted to know why it failed, and what he could learn from the failure. And he observed the big takeaway of the discovery; the mold killed the staphylococcus. This became the discovery that blew the doors open on antibiotics, a major advancement for modern medicine!\n\nSo the thing that always amazes me about intelligent people, is their ability to observe. To take what most of us would consider to be mundane, and understand it better. \n\nI've also noticed that very intelligent people may also take time to first think about a question before answering it. And their answers may be unorthodox, or be answered in a unique way, but they are always interesting and thought provoking. \n\nAnd also I think there are a lot of smart people that have made great discoveries, or invented new things. But they are also different from each other. There's no one \"smart person\" personally. Some smart people are dicks. Some are very personable. Some are quiet and take some getting to know before you understand their brilliance. Some are the most extroverted person in the room. There are a lot of different kinds of smart people, and you can't really rely on the tropes of what a smart person should look like.\n\nAlso, not all smart people are smart in every topic. I've heard clearly very intelligent and smart people in their own right say occasionally dismissive, or outright ignorant things. Well, nobody's perfect. And smart people can sometimes be very dumb. Sure, you can tell me this super complex theorem that makes my head spin, but maybe you really don't know that much about economics as the economics professor, so maybe don't try and argue on a topic you know very little of.",

The people who are unbelievably empathetic, are able to light up rooms, always seem to get people engaged in conversation, the people who everyone likes at the party. They always seem to say the right thing, and you can tell when someone is this way just by listening to them.\n\nSome people are smart in terms of critical thinking/problem solving, you see this outlined in very unique ways across the spectrum. Take an athlete, might not be great in terms of understanding concepts on, let's say, science. But in the heat of a game, they can understand the patterns of the opposing team, adjust strategy, keep one step ahead. Or take a man/woman from an underprivileged community, put them below the poverty line, and watch them solve problems in real time when it comes to finding money, saving money or spending money. (Although inherently people who don't have money aren't great with money in terms of savings, but if you never have experience saving money, then how can you be expected to know how, especially when you don't know what the next month/week will even bring)\n\nDefining intelligence is difficult, especially taking into consideration what actually makes someone intelligent. And then trying to figure out how those manifest is harder, when you consider all of the different walks of life people walk down, and what role that privilege of a better education and a better family life plays into the perception.",

They may be generally distant from other people because interaction with other people can be difficult for them, or they tend to rub people the wrong way. They can also be very annoying because they don‚Äôt agree with everything someone else says because what they know or understand dictates otherwise.\n\nTo an intelligent person social norms, or societal correctness doesn‚Äôt mean much compared to being correct. Not in the sense that they have to be right all the time, but if society fully believes A but in truth B is the answer. They won‚Äôt accept A, because B is the real answer.

I look at people who see both sides regardless of how they might feel are socially intelligent and kind of realize that everything‚Äôs subjective so nobodies ‚Äúright‚Äù . I feel like there‚Äôs also a good chance a person that thinks that way socially is probably academically gifted as well, or at the very least a fairly deep thinker‚Ä¶.not referring to myself by any means for i am a simpleton that took 26 years to start to grasp this concept slightly üòÇ. Honestly I‚Äôm really stupid lol",

            "text": "Generally, highly intelligent people can spot other highly intelligent people and don't assume that geniuses are jerks - maybe because they understand more about intelligence from experience or maybe because the more intelligent you are, the harder it is to maintain strong prejudices and beliefs in stereotypes.  When someone tells me the people on big bang theory are so smart, it makes me cringe because a lot of people really seem to believe that big words + bad social skills + job they couldn't do = genius.  Very opposite from true in most cases.\n\nSecond, when grouped together intelligent people often pick up on things faster and laugh about things together.  When I've gone to Mensa meetings (only requires IQ in top 2%, not .25% like genius but still highly intelligent) people laugh a lot when things are funny, and often they're silly situational things you pick up on that aren't worth even talking about but the joy of noticing it along with someone else makes it an unspoken inside joke.  My mom used to complain that my dad and uncle would start laughing together for no reason and it wasn't until I was older and picked up in situations on why they laughed, that I realized this was what was happening.\n\nThird thing I've noticed in life but again, confirmed situationally for me by Mensa, is how normal most highly intelligent people are.  I went to a Mensa meeting in a rural town and guess what?  There was a farmer, a housewife, a girl in admin at the local college, a couple people in random white collar jobs, etc.  And these people spoke like a farmer, a housewife, and so forth.  Intelligence doesn't make you a high earner, it's just a boost if you want to go in that direction.  But a lot of intelligent people have trouble holding down a job or in many cases, follow the career paths they're familiar with or feel a calling towards just like anyone else.  And their daily struggles aren't about theoretical physics or ancient history, even though they might be highly capable of making their lives all about those academic pursuits if they wanted to.",

The people who are so insecure about their own intelligence that every time someone says they might be wrong about something, it becomes a huge argument. (huge pet peeve of mine btw)\n\nBut the most intelligent people i‚Äôve ever met, also happen to be some of the quietest most relaxed people i‚Äôve ever met. Truly intelligent people know they are smart and don‚Äôt feel the need to go out and prove that to people. (btw i‚Äôm not just talking school smarts, it can be general intelligence, street smarts, etc.)\n\nBut you have to remember, the smartest people never stop learning. The people with the most incredible brains are the people who are constantly learning new things, the people that have an undying thirst for information. \n\nKano Jigoro, the father of modern Judo, once told his students, ‚ÄúWhen I die, bury me in my white belt.‚Äù His wish was to be remembered as a student, not as a black belt master. Great leaders see themselves as lifelong learners. They are never satisfied or found thinking they have achieved mastery. The best of the best continually pursue personal growth and skill development.\n\nTLDR: Smart people shut their mouth",

The people that are really intelligent generally fly under the radar, content to observe what‚Äôs going on and from my experience only input an opinion once they‚Äôve taken the time to really think it all through. So in essence in my opinion, which I‚Äôm happy to have someone question and challenge, is that a person who is a little smarter than the average wants the world to know that they‚Äôre smarter and needs the validation to be seen as smarter, but the really intelligent don‚Äôt need the validation of their peers to know just what it is that they‚Äôre able to do.

They posit an explanation and say maybe this is why but the dumb ones assume their first answer is correct and then immediately move on.

I think there are a few factors related to the appearance of intelligence:\n\nCommunication skills are the ability to convey a concept.\n\nKnowledge is the accumulation and recall of information.\n\nWisdom is a bit more abstract, but I see it as the ability to apply calm logic.\n\nObservational skills are the ability to assess an environment to acquire information without it being directly provided.  \n\nThose all can appear to be intelligence, but I don't believe they strictly are.  **Intelligence is the ability to take a information (either provided or from knowledge or observation), understand it, and apply it.  The more intelligent the person the faster and deeper the understanding for a given set of information.**\n\nThe best subtle indicator of intelligence is a the ability to receive new information and immediately understand as well as those who are familiar with that information.  Best example for emotional or social intelligence is entering a new social situation and almost immediately understanding the dynamics of the group.  A technical example can be seen when someone joins a new project that they are not familiar with and can almost immediately understand the details as well as those who have had extensive time to process the information.",

How much you know about certain subjects or how many subjects you know about‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs a complex question, depending who‚Äôs asking and what intelligence means to them. Now, Some people are naturally intelligence and for some it takes work. In my experience, those I marked as ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù were the ones I‚Äôd enjoy speaking to about a subject and for great lengths. I think open minded people, not necessarily unbiased but willing to hear another‚Äôs opinion and understand why they might have that opinion. I, myself, am an unbiased person and very open minded. Not saying I‚Äôm super intelligent because I‚Äôm not even sure what that entails, truly. People say I‚Äôm smart and some days I feel ‚Äúdumb‚Äù and ask myself if I‚Äôm pretentious or do I really know things. Who cares? I‚Äôm autistic btw which is probably why I‚Äôm unbiased by default. I like to know everything, not for other people, but for myself. I am genuinely excited for knowledge and the one thing that screws me up about death is that I don‚Äôt have time to know everything. If I‚Äôm not too thrilled about a subject I‚Äôll still like to know it somewhat but if I am thrilled about the subject? Forget about it, I dive deep into the subject. Also, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs about what you say, usually. It‚Äôs how you say it. If you can reach someone with your words then that‚Äôs a skill. I went off on a tangent but I like thought provoking subjects. I was told from a friend that I should like a philosopher lol I almost took that up on college but I feel like there‚Äôs no point.

Since we know in U.S. the average IQ is 98 the majority may see things differently.\n\nThen there's the psychosocial element. A toxic intelligent person will manifest differently than a someone that's intelligent and well grounded with good self esteem and positive intentions. \n\nDefining intelligence also could be subjectively different for every person. For example, If my IQ was 90 I might see someone with a higher IQ's of 110 as being intelligent vs someone with an IQ of 140 that may not. In essence you could say intelligence is relative to your frame of reference. \n\nAnd that could hold true of values and morals which can shape what we deem as intelligent.

Someone that operates out of spirit may look like idiot for their beliefs while others may not. \nSo I would say your answer lies within you as a unique person.",

It‚Äôs impressive to meet the occasional international math champion who can also make decent conversation at a bar without talking about school or how brilliant they are. They are able to do what they do without having to dedicate the entirety of their existence into one sole pursuit in that kind of obsessive/aspergersy way. \n\nThe ones who have a broad array of curiosities and interests. Interested in, and not threatened by, new words, concepts, and opinions. I know plenty of people who are very bright and shine in their little corner of the world, but any conversation out of their field about philosophy, physics, math, music, etc‚Ä¶and they‚Äôre too cool for everything. If it‚Äôs not their thing, then, ‚ÄúDude no one gives a shit about that stuff.‚Äù\n\nThe ones who are ethical and human. Academia has lots of sharp elbows, gunners, and cut throats.

The term ‚Äúhigh functioning autism‚Äù from what I have read actually was coined in Australia and referred to people with a high iq. Generally it means that the iq is probably quite high. It also means that they struggle socially.\n\nThe reason I know this is because I was diagnosed in preschool and I had to work hard to cover up some of my social flaws and by high school they could hardly notice it. Though the school did notice it. I had talked to my therapist a little while before and he had said that I am extremely high functioning which means that I am pretty socially aware. I did some research and found what I had mentioned about high functioning autism.\nThough sometimes I do question my intelligence.

I.e., it's a strong enough motivator that people will ignore or sacrifice other rewards in favor of figuring shit out, because although their efforts to figure shit out may make them suffer they'll suffer more if they don't.\n\nE.g., say two kids are learning some circle math for the first time. You show them that the formula for the area of a circle is œÄ*r*\\^2, and assign them to use that to solve several practice problems. The goal of the exercise is just to solve the practice problems.\n\nKid A pops that into the calculator for a few practice problems, fastidiously shows their work with the assigned formula on the sheet, finds the correct answers, and gets an A. Good for them! Smart kid!\n\nKid B also pops it into the calculator, demonstrates that they know how to get the same correct answers, and still seems really unsatisfied. Although they know the correct formula, you see that they're also penciling in other calculations in the margins--and tinkering with alternative approaches to try to get more insight into what the heck is going on with œÄr\\^2 that gets it to produce the correct answer. If the assignment is timed, or if they decide to 'test' a theory they have about an alternate approach by actually using a different method to try to answer a question, then their tinkering could even hurt their grade.\n\nThere's nothing *wrong* with Kid A; that kid could end up learning math quite well. They're just exhibiting a tendency to be satisfied with instrumental learning: they want to learn the math well enough to use it to accomplish some *other* goal, and they're satisfied when they do. That's totally adequate for most purposes, and that person could end up being quite successful in some career that requires strong math skills. They're just clearly more interested in obtaining that other goal by learning the skill than they are in learning for its own sake.\n\nHowever, I suspect that Kid B is going to end up being a much more sophisticated thinker than Kid A, because Kid B's behavior suggests that curiosity is a primary motivator for them. They know how they're supposed to do the assignment, and they can do that; however, they've also just been exposed to a novel and challenging concept, they understand that they don't grok it, and they're more interested in trying to wrap their head around it than they are in trying to apply the optimal grade-getting strategy.",

If they are asked something or talking about a subject which they are unsure about or don't know the immediate answer to, they might answer with something along the lines of \"I'm not completely sure but can try to find out or read up on it\" or perhaps \"I actually don't know much about this so I don't think it's appropriate for me to make too many assumptions and thoughts about that\".\n\nI find less intelligent people to be very subjective, close minded and often times get defensive when talking about a subject which they don't know much about or something which they have a (strong) opinion on even if the arguments and science is against them.

You could also call this adaptation and foresight, this is to me a profound sign of intelligence, although this sounds very general. If you can see the chain of events in your head, you‚Äôre able to therefore adapt your behaviour to create the best possible circumstances or prevent something negative.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a term for this, but seeing that everything requires a solid foundation in order for it to function optimally is also very intelligent. An example would be how a person with strong values, sense of morality, social skills, good physique, understanding of psychology and character; always has something to fall back on and also, base their decisions on.\n\nThis can however also create too much of a dogmatic attitude which is where the ability to adapt comes in handy.

These meetings can take range from two people up to a dozen with various PhD types in one language, sometimes ASL thrown in or dialects( Southern California) with English/Spanish.

Or like my sister is smart in a way that she'll memorise every number in a phone and has great sense of direction and can build but says she can't write an essay but I think she can learn easily; whereas, I have an honours degree in sports science & nutrition, love my psychology but couldnt build anything to save myself so more \"book smart\". I feel I am wise with experiences, like with people.  Could talk to anyone 1 on 1 when I find common ground, but an introvert at heart, like take a while to come out of my shell because I like to suss things out in my head first- like a new job seeing how people react to each other first.\nLike someone noticed right away today, their like you have a damn good memory because I'm like yeah I never forget a face, he was in my high school. People do tend to come to me for advice on personal circumstances because I can relate & empathise.\nMy brother is most definetly a genius, his intelligence in everything is just something else, them escape rooms turning pictures into equations and solving X.

She says at first you'll always be judged on looks because they dont yet have anything to go on - looks like a barbie doll type - not anything untoward, thats what my older work colleague called me \"her wee barbie doll\", so she was told thats why your perfect because they'll underestimate your intelligence.  Which she's highly educated in interviewing criminals, forensics, an author etc etc.  But when she opens her mouth (like says previously) she just eludes confidence and your fascinated to listen to her. I can't remember her name right now, but I'm going to buy & read her book, it's called bulletproof - she was on an empowering women interview.  I'll need to look her up.

It could mean wisdom, creativity, IQ score etc. \n     An IQ score is supposed to be a general sense of somebody‚Äôs intelligence but it doesn‚Äôt seem to measure creativity. The best way I‚Äôve heard to measure somebody‚Äôs creative abilities is to Instruct them to come up with as many different possibilities something could be used for within 60 seconds. Then give them a word (‚Äútowel!‚Äù) and start the timer. Creative people will be able to come up with plenty of uses for such a thing. (Window curtain, air filter, whatever) and somebody with lots of creative ability could possibly be low on the IQ scale.\n    One thing that will always be beneficial to becoming intelligent is to not a be afraid of asking questions. If somebody doesn‚Äôt have a problem asking what a word means they usually seem to be intelligent. Not in all cases however. They could just be an idiot but also trying their hardest to not be one. \n       I‚Äôd say that the best subtle sign That someone is really intelligent is if they can spell very well. Somebody that can recall the spelling of a word they have only read once years ago can also recall information about relevant things when needed",

Look for the ones with notebooks or laptops in the corners; Look for the ones that speak naturally and fluently to a few, similarly acting/intelligent people, but are otherwise quiet; Look for the ones that are very specific in their wording; and Look for people who seem like they are about to say something, but stop themselves frequently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can tell someone is intelligent when someone isn't speaking to many people, but it doesn't seem like it is because they are depressed, rather, because they are introspective. This is likely because they were previously very very talkative, but people wouldn't be interested or educated enough in the concepts they discuss to meaningfully respond, so they learned to shut up to avoid having to explain why the topic is important repeatedly (which leads to the other person feeling dumb, when they are not). Instead they contemplate the concepts in their head and may have notes/files with their thoughts (if you see someone in a corner consistently with a notebook or a computer, that can be a sign). They may also seem like they are about to say something or jut into a conversation but stop themselves often (this may appear odd to an outside viewer, but it is likely that an interesting concept came to their mind that they can't share due to believing that others may be unable to meaningfully supply criticism or commentary). Some people never leave the talkative stage (so look for people that talk a lot trying to convey basic points, and they may be more intelligent due to being specific and precise in their wording), but they often see that speaking about concepts casually that go over other people's heads causes them to want to socially interact less at an early age. This applies to many presentations of intelligence (like with art, mathematics, the sciences, engineering, etc.). If two people are equally intelligent, but in different areas, they are likely to allow each other to explain these concepts knowing full well the other individual will not fully understand, but, by being in similar situations, allow the concept to be discussed out of respect and the higher likelihood the other will have heard of the concept deeply enough to offer their thoughts. Often, while they are in different areas of interest, two intelligent people can have deep conversation on a topic they share experience with or overlap in interest, such as an artist and an engineer, or a scientist and a mathematician, an author and a philosopher, etc. This may lead to a friend circle with an inner circle of closer friends, or even just acquaintances, which all seem antisocial to the public as far as being willing to convey ideas, but they will converse very fluently when together. This seemingly antisocial behavior may be because they do not like to even risk the potential of what others may perceive as being boastful of intelligence, when attempting to strike up conversation. Intelligent people often assume unconsciously or hope that those around them are equally intelligent in the same ways. I once had one come up to me and attempt a conversation about differential geometry and typology in middle school (both terms I still don't know the definition of). I didn't understand most of what he said, but that is how it is for intelligent people.",

As it was described to me: intelligence is the ability to correctly guess the outcome of a situation. I believe this applies to both good and bad outcomes. Like if you were to guess that you were to get something wrong, or that you‚Äôre gonna do bad on a test. Knowing what happens next by analyzing the situation to get the answer is a show of Intelligence. \n\n There are people who are very ‚Äúcocky‚Äù with their show of intelligence, but I would say the best way to know if someone is intelligent without saying it (subtly intelligent) is to ask them how the came to the reasoning behind the answer they gave. The fluid state of thought flows like a stream, not a tsunami. Often time they will explain it as a ‚Äúlucky guess‚Äù and often times it is, but when they tell you how their thought process connected them to answer, you have yourself an intelligent person.

            "text": "PhD student in psychology here‚Äî\nThis is a really cool topic because there are so many different theories of what all encompasses one‚Äôs intelligence. Every ‚ÄúIQ/intelligence test‚Äù is based off specific theories but there are a few key ideas that are generally agreed to be interactive elements when assessing intelligence. \n1. Crystallized intelligence: this is basically the ability to utilize prior learning in the present. This includes learning how to do simple math and later use addition to solve a problem in front on you. It‚Äôs accessing the resources you already posses effectively. \n2. Fluid intelligence: this is the ability to use abstract thinking for problem solving and logical reasoning without already having learned how to do what is in front of you. Think of this in the context of puzzles‚Äî you don‚Äôt know which piece goes where but you can use various types of reasoning to figure it out as you go. \n3. Creative intelligence: this requires the ability to come up with novel solutions. This is the epitome of ‚Äúthinking outside the box‚Äù, but being effective in the process of creating unique outcomes indicates higher creative intelligence. \n\nDifferent theories describe multiple types of intelligence (some say there are 7, some say 12, some say 4, etc) but most of those categories are related to the ideas within these 3 categories. Not all intelligence tests include creative intelligence, but it‚Äôs more common in recent assessments. \n\nI think intelligence is a complex interaction between drawing on previously learned information, engaging in critical thinking/logical reasoning, and thinking outside of the box to solve problems. Without all three, you would be limited in your problem solving processes and risk becoming close minded to outside possibilities.",

Watching this, it seems it can be extremely hard to know if someone is intelligent based on their looks and personality. HOWEVER--the one person who bragged the most and talked herself up the most (referring to the number of degrees she had) ended up being the least intelligent out of the 5. Perhaps you shouldn't be looking for signs as to whether someone is intelligent--rather signs pointing to a lack of intelligence.\n\n[Jubilee - Strangers Rank Their Intelligence](https://youtu.be/RAlI0pbMQiM)",
