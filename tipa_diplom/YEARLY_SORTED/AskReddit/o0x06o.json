I also feel that in alot of the videos I see there is a concerted effort to make the female orgasm (in some cases using vibrators in addition to manual stimulation ala Owen Gray)\n\nI think the idea that.... 'there is no foreplay'....or 'he expects me to suck it whilst doing nothing to me'....or 'he pumps into me from behind and only gets himself off'... is much more to do with selfish guys than porn specifically. \n\nIt's easy to simply stereotype all porn, but there is obviously an absolutely ridiculous amount of variety out there and I really dont think its accurate to lump it all together as 'bad', when I'm sure there are also millions of women and men who have benefited from the knowledge its given their partner.",

            "text": "Not a lady, but I have 6 sisters and was raised by a lesbian  - their horror stories are the stuff of legend.\n\nMy oldest sister had a guy come over as she was trying to meet him in a safe place, he proceeded to try absolutely molest her on the couch in front of us. His hands and tongue were all over the place, and he was going to town on her face like a damn golden retriever happy to see a family member he hadn't seen in a year. That happened when we were kids, we are all now in our late 40s and still talk about that. I think it traumatized all of us.\n\nMy middle sister had a guy show up to the grocery store she worked at and talk to her while she was checking his groceries. He then came back every day for 2 weeks to get in her line, she just thought he was a regular dude that needed a lot of things. Turns out he would get his groceries, go through her line, then go sit in his car and spank it while watching her through the front door of the store. He got arrested and was given a trespass warning. She eventually had file a restraining order and move to a different town because he would not leave her alone. She was 16 years old.\n\nNot the point of the topic, but just, wow can men be dumb-asses sometimes.\n\nMen growing up learning about sex is not something most of us are taught. Our fathers who may try to talk to us are not going to tell us about slapping, choking, spitting, tying up, doggy, 69, or anything else. They will tell you, reluctantly, that you have a penis and it goes into the vagina and that is about it. That is all the \"training\" we are given.\n\nUnfortunately, since the late 90's/early 2000's, porn has become so widespread and accessible that it has replaced training by experience. Men have seen EVERYTHING that can be done by one person to another before they are old enough to grow pubic hair.\n\nWhat they don't see is that women in porn, who have either retired or are willing to talk about the industry, will tell you they do not enjoy the type of sex that they shoot regularly. Not that they can't physically enjoy it, but emotionally and preferentially, they do not like it.\n\nMen fail to remember that women are women, even in porn, and yes, even in hardcore porn. They want to be treated with respect, listened to, and have their needs met as well. They may play a character who likes a 7 man tag-team match, but in reality, they want their partner and whatever they have both consented to doing in their relationship.\n\nSociety needs to get back to the basics of teaching men, well everyone really,  what a healthy relationship looks like, one that is built on respect. We need to teach people to listen and understand what your partner desires in bed, open communication, and then progressing forward when you both are comfortable moving to something less vanilla. This includes one-night stands. It doesn't cost anything to ask what they prefer and listen to how they want it done.\n\nThat means take your time, find out what works, and go from there. It does not mean going from kissing to trying to fist your partner while putting her in a sleeper hold with your other arm on the 1st date.\n\nTo the ladies - communication is key. You must express what you want, and do not want, when you're asked about it, or when something isn't working. Saying \"OMG, just stop. I am not in the mood anymore!\" doesn't work for you or them. They will never learn to do it the way you want it if you do take the time to teach them. You also have to remember that the little trick you like is not going to work on the next woman he is with, or would have worked on a previous woman. Please stop acting like men should automatically know that you like soft, small, circles with fingers, when his last girlfriend wanted up and down and really aggressive. You may hate nipple play, his previous might have loved it and wanted more of that than anything. Women are not built the same and it is unfair to think that men should know exactly what you want and how you want it without your input.\n\nIt is very frustrating when we know you want us to do something but won't tell us what it is. If you want soft, slow, rubbing, then say so. If you enjoy getting spanked, then tell us you want to be spanked. If you want to be choked, show us how you want us to do it. Tied up? No problem, just tell us and we can do what you are comfortable doing. There will be no shaming, unless you want it, for any kink/acts you want to explore as long as both are into it. \n\nThe same thing goes for your partner, too. If your partner says \"I want to try this...\" and you aren't into it, don't shame them or make fun of them. They are trusting you with something they would not tell anyone else, especially friends or family. They are confiding in you a vulnerability and it needs to be treated as such. Tell them you aren't into it right now, but ask if they would consider an alternative instead. Then follow through on your alternative.\n\nLastly, sex toys. Listen, they are not a threat to you or your partner. Yes, they can make a woman have upwards of 20+ orgasms in one session depending on how she is feeling. That doesn't mean she doesn't want you or that you cannot participate in the process. The sad truth is that most women cannot orgasm by penetration alone, they just can't. It isn't your size, it isn't your girth, it is not physically anything to do with a man. It is just the way the woman is built, and most women are built with the clit too far away from the vaginal opening to get contact with the penis. Some women can reach orgasm with minor stimulation on the inside of the vagina from rubbing against the muscles that lead to the clit. Again, most women, probably 9/10 you have ever seen, cannot do this. Toys are one way they can achieve an orgasm and, if you are doing it right, lots more. Do not be intimidated by them, get on her team. Find out what she likes, what works for her, and shop for them. Becoming part of the fun, instead of being jealous of it, will bring you much closer to your partner. Any man who says \"oh, well if you need toys you don't know how to satisfy your woman\" has a partner who can orgasm via penetration, a very rare person, or she has been faking it with him as to not to hurt his feelings. \n\nWomen, please don't let your man walk around thinking he is doing something when he obviously isn't. He is going to teach his sons bad habits one day and the cycle just continues.\n\nYour sexual health, and your partners, depends on open communication and trust. Start talking to each other, be active in the pursuit of pleasure for one another, and you will stop living through these horror stories of sexual dysfunction.",

To me it has always been pretty obvious what is real and what is fake in porn, there are plenty of visual cues to show that. The eyes and facial expressions of a woman are a pretty dead giveaway, and its hard to fake the facial expressions present when a girl is actually having a real orgasm or really enjoying herself because almost everyone looks (or even sounds) like a complete dumbass when they are having an actual orgasm, and almost nobody looks like they are in pain constantly or uses their hands to achieve some level of depth control, which I see a lot in the pro stuff. There are usually a lot of other cues to go along with that as well and it doesn't take much effort to see.\n\nUltimately it comes down to sex education I think. I studied sex and the female body on my own in my teenage years as a total desperate virgin in the 90's because I decided that I wanted to be \"good\" at sex when I started fucking - It didn't help with that, as my first time was still awkward and unsatisfying for both me and her, but I at least had some understanding of what to do and not do and how to communicate. Hell, I'm still learning more twenty years later. I guess I always figured that the studying was a common thing among boys because we are nearly all obsessed with sex. I do know for a fact that nothing my health class taught me had anything to do with how to give pleasure though, which is understandable but short sighted IMO. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, I hope you ladies that are experiencing these nightmares will take the time to teach any sons you raise about how to be attentive to a woman rather than jackhammering and four fingering their way through what essentially boils down to a self pleasure session. The boys will thank you for it, and their women will appreciate your forethought.",

Some of these issues don’t present at the start of the relationship, and only become evident when the novelty of sex with a new person wears off for the man. \n\nUnfortunately, I am of an age where most men in my dating pool would have learned sex from porn at the onset of puberty, and even partners who didn’t have an addiction to porn tended to show traits of the laziness common in porn users, mostly resulting in an expectation for them to have a guaranteed orgasm, while mine was optional almost every time.

This opens up the world of communication, and communication is key while being intimate. Because remember, every girl is different when it comes to sex. Oh boy did I find that out after I started using that line. You see, Becky doesn't like oral, she liked me to lube up my fingers and stimulate her that way, but with no finger penetration, more like a soft and slow massage. Her favorite position, missionary and being on the side. Now we have Samantha, she was a freak but fun. She likes oral, and I mean messy oral, she also likes strawberry-kiwi massage oil down there, now the taste is horrible, but just go with it. Her favorite position, on top and reverse cowgirl. Also in the middle of reverse cow girl she would transition to 69 for a few minutes and then back to reverse cowgirl. It was surprising but fun. Then we have shy girl Trisha, she was great, she likes 2 finger penetration with the thumb stimulating the clit. She likes it slow with soft rubs. Her favorite position, on her stomach and doggy style. Likes to cuddle afterwards, but first we clean up. I have more, but don't have time. As you can see, we all enjoyed each other company.

            "text": "**tl;dr** - \n\n1. This is a older guy's perspective and may or may not be welcome\n2. Death grip syndrome is real, porn and toys hardwire the brain harder than heroin... and it can be fixed.\n3. Discussion about sexual preferences is a must for both guys and girls no matter what you think and what you think you know.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n\n**Watching too much porn almost killed me**\n\nAs an older guy who grew up without a dad in the house, I was already an adult and well into dating when the Internet started, I had never really been into watching hardcore porn. The only access to porn were soft porn magazines (ex: playboy/Penthouse and sometimes SportsIllustrated SwimSuit edition). Sometimes a friend would steal a vhs tape from his dad and lend it out (really strange to think of now). I did very much enjoy erotic literature (still prefer it to this day) - thank you Penthouse Letters lol.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn my early 30s, I hit a bit of a dry spell. Online porn had just begun to be watchable (back then, you had to actually find it and download it for hours before you could actually watch anything and you prayed the file wasn't corrupted). But I did discover death grip syndrome. Its a horrible thing for a guy to think you may lose your \"manhood\" at any age. The anxiety gets bad, to the point you start giving up dating - which in turns just increases your dependency/addiction to porn and heavy depression from the anxiety (I'm talking about suicidal level depression). Looking at Today's generation, I can really see a HUGE negative impact on sexuality and from my perspective its the saddest thing to witness as I compare how it was before vs how it is now. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nDeath grip syndrome is a very real nightmare. Really sad to think that young guys having to deal with forms of erectile dysfunction from beating it too often and thus causing a numbing of the nerves in the penis. Adding a dependency to visual stimulation makes physical sex much more complicated as they battle the anxiety and humiliation of losing their erections as they attempt to immitate what they have watched. Its a real modern problem, its gone as far as to create a dependency to ED pills in guys 18-30. Really really bad. The same can also be said for women that are using vibrators with a really fast motor... running the risk of making it impossible to reach orgasm by human interaction. I'd compare the concept of a guy needing to watch porn during sex about the same to a girl having to use a toy to climax. Perhaps I'm wrong, but to me, this seems more like a disconnection between two people during intimacy and you may be \nmissing out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBoys and girls, this needs to be fixed asap. Understand that I'm not anti-porn but I do prefer to be with a woman than to masturbate. But, I had to put effort into it just as anyone would with any addiction. This isn't something you will into existence. Just like being addicted to the hardest drugs (including candy) you have to take steps: recognise the problem, take measures and comit to the change. It took me weeks/months to break out of it, and ya, it eventurally worked. I was only hooked on porn for 2-3 years... how many years do you think Today's generation has been hooked on it ?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**If you're not listening, you're not learning**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n~~Boys~~ People have always been awkward when it comes to acting confident. They have a very hard time distinguishing between what they think and what they know. So I got a real good laugh reading through this thread as I can relate the actual lack of skills during intercourse. For one, I had no clue how the clit functioned until my mid-20s. Back then, even women weren't really aware of their own bodies and an orgasm was practically mystical for some (they weren't sure if they really had or not reached one). But holly crap, the different ways to get a ~~women~~ person to cum is mindblowing. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nActually discussing (talking and listening) goes a really long way. I remember a gf of mine once said: **learning to make a girl cum... just means you know how to make that one girl cum**. It blew my mind and opened the door to a life changing discussion (we still thank eachother to this day). Its also important to note that its the same for guys... sure you can jerk him off long enough until he pops - and ya, when you're a \"young, dumb and full of cum\" that's just happy to have someone give you some sexual attention may look amazing ... understand that there's a world a difference between \"meh sex\" and \"mind blowing holly fucking shit wow sex\". And ladies, you're not the only ones to fake orgasms... guys sometimes fake cumming in condoms just to get it over with.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBe attentive, body language goes a long way. If you're lucky enough to have him/her masturbate in front of you... observe, learn and realise how amazing of a moment that is. Notice how, which finger(s), speed/tempo... understand that some require A LOT of concentration to orgasm (btw this also applies to some guys). Worst case ask what the other person likes and how they like it. And guys, if you're lucky enough to see them orgasm, notice the symptoms (curled toes, flustered face, uncontrollable twitching, breathing, etc) - if you're not getting this, sorry to say she's either not into you, too shy or thinking of her next grocery list. And ladies, if the guy you're with dosen't seem to want to learn... its either because he just doesn't know, is also shy (even when pretending to be macho and all) or maybe he really dosen't care and just wants to empty his balls. If that's the case, drop his ass but make sure to tell him why... allow that to fester in his brain and hopefully make him better to later.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou think you can be good on yourself... there are some that can make you feel even better. I know some people will stay that's \"impossible\"... as a guy, I've known a few girls to literally figure out how to jerk me off better than I can, hell some have literally fucked me bettert han a blowjob. And I know I've done the same to some girls as well... once you're a bar setter for someone trust me... you're staying in their fantasies forever. But ladies, just remember, a few of you here are laughing at how some guys are clueless, I can tell you by personal experience that there probably just as many ladies that could probably benefit to learning a few things. So instead of laughing at them, why not figure out how to make them the best you've ever had.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOh... and btw guys, squirt is pee. Yes the orgasm that comes with it \"may be\" real... but the fluid is urine. So if you welcome the squirt in your mouth, in your face... you're into receiving golden showers.",

It seems not only is there a lack of communication with sexual partners, but with other people of the same gender and orientation.  There seems a complete lack of knowledge that sexual desires and preferred type of stimulation can vary quite a bit from person to person.  This thread not only shows that a lot of men assume certain things about sex, whether it be due to porn or past experiences, but women also assume certain things.  I am somewhat shocked that so many woman think that every woman likes things exactly the same way they do, and that no woman could possibly like things that they personally don't.  Communication is the way around many of the issues stated in this thread, and it should never be on just one party to do the communicating.",

And the obligatory rub it like it's a lottery ticket, squeeze them like they're pimples and hard machinery like pounding with the fingers. \nAn ex if mine, the first time we were together, once said in the weirdest voice \"I'm here\" while putting it in for the first time. I almost laughed but just kinda sighed and got it over with. He said it like he was a mother trying to soothe a crying baby. I was so shook by the sheer randomness of the \"I'm here\" that i just... Needless to say, i did not finish, i was also there as there must be two or more present for sex between multiple parties. Same guy also had such a severe porn addiction that he *could not* fathom it being a hard no, no way for me with bdsm. It was like it was so unfathomable for him that i would not like being hit, spanked with a belt and strapped into place. I even explained that even if i were to be into it, my PTSD is a pretty big mood kill in that respect. \nSame guy also used my towels to dry his dong of after he masterbated in the shower, and when I asked him about it, he just said \"well i thought we were sharing, and you were sleeping so i didn't wanna wake you up to fuck\". Did i mention i only found out about the towel because i *dried my face in it* after taking my morning shower? It was a bad way to wake up. \nOther instances of \"just no, you watch too much porn\" vibes and things he did:\n\n- have a stack of laptops on his desktop filled with only porn. Only. Porn. Categorised into the different PC's. \n\n- woke me up unintentionally almost every night to the wiggling of him jerking off to porn while I slept. \n\n- telling me about the girls he still had crushes on, and how he didn't talk to them because he would get feeling for them again and wanna fuck them.\n\n- groped me one night to get off, claiming he didn't know better. \n\n- forced me into bdsm play after i told him multiple times, again no, PTSD.\n\n- insisted i be the Dom then in bdsm, because he cold get off otherwise. I did it and I regret it. \n\n- told me *the first day* that he was into fake \nsnuff.\n\nI hate myself for staying with him for 2 years, i was so broken already and i think i was staying in it as a way to selfharm. He really fucked me up in some ways i can't even describe. \n\n- Fun fact!: On my birthday he got me a ring with a sticky note on it, saying he'd never marry me. He also stalked me and hacked into my socials and google accounts after we broke up and found my new boyfriends first, middle, and last name. Then he lied and guilt tripped me after i finally confronted him about it, 2-3 months later after having locked myself out of all of my accounts cause I had to change passwords so often. He said I was only alive because of him, and that he had saved me for nothing.\n He didn't save me, i saved myself.  I'm still so pissed at him and i hope he gets help because he was so far into pornderland that he couldn't connect the dots in real life because all he knew was that pizza guys get laid and hot punk girls like being tazzed and drowned on command.

You girls really had it thought I genuinely never tought any guy would do half the stuff you described here. I mean I have watched porn for as long as I can remember, and although I stopped watching for 1 month or so and don't plan on going back in any near future, it never gave me the impression I could do any of those things in real life. In that regard its like any other movies, I don't watch Harry Potter and then afterwards stand in front of the mailbox waiting for my letter, or pick up plates up by saying \"wingardium leviosa\". So how come people have those expectations? For me the interest in porn was actually seeing stuff that I would never be able to do. In all fairness in my 12 year old relationship I have asked one or two things but we reached an agreement of what was acceptable and went on with our lifes. But honestly doing something like rubbing the clit as if I were trying to remove a stain from a lamp and expecting my wife to grant me 3 wishes is just pathetic. And slapping the vagina?! I don't remember ever seeing that even... Anyway kudos to all you for enduring that.",

Very selfish.\n\nContinually mentioned but yes the jackhammering. Slow and sensual is the way to go. Or maybe it isn't. Ask questions, read the situation. A lot of the time frantic fucking doesn't feel like anything, especially if you don't slow it down first and give her the chance to feel you. If her face is bored, she's not into it. If she's looking like she's in pain, you're probably sucker punching her cervix over and over again and she's too polite to tell you to stop because it seems like you're having a good time.\n\nAsk her to place your finger on her clit if you can't find it. That frantic rubbing is a dead giveaway for identifying porn watchers. Ask how she likes it rubbed. Be gentle. Light touched are way better than pressing. Every session has the potential to need something different. Even when flying solo. \n\nDefault, be gentle with the nipples. Definitely pay attention to them though. Don't suck on them like you're nursing. Lick or gently rub over them. Don't squeeze, pinch or grab the whole thing unless you know she likes it. If you want to grab the whole thing, just understand usually you're the only one that likes this, so don't linger on it like she's getting off on it too.\n\nThis is getting more advice-y than anything but if you're going to do oral and you don't have facial hair, shave your fucking stubble. Having someone sandpaper your thighs or pubic bone makes it hard to concentrate on anything else. \n\nAlso, another dead give away that you're a porn watcher:  trying to get our legs out of the way like up on your shoulders or higher. I love PIV and can orgasm that way but it's usually facilitated by the pubic areas rubbing together. Once the legs are positioned so that doesn't happen, it doesn't feel like anything.",

Before that, quickly, I want to emphasize to the guys here that basically any complaint you saw here more than 2 or 3 times should be something you take seriously, perhaps none of it as absolute gospel (except the communication and consent stuff, that's gospel and shouldn't need to be said) as everyone will be different and any given woman you are with might be into to one or more of these things that most hate. Communicate and learn though. Default to assuming they aren't into these \"common complaint\" things you see here and find out any exceptions tactfully.\n\nOk so this is the point of consideration I hope some of the ladies here will read. Dicks are simple. I can name the amount of things you are liable to do wrong on like one hand. If this thread were reversed it would be one comment saying \"don't scrape with teeth, don't bend the dick wildly while on top, and remember the sensitive part is the underside of the tip when doing hand stuff\" and that would be the whole thread. You guys get to do sex on training wheels. We have to learn how build a motorcycle from scratch then learn how to to ride it and the instruction manual is out of order, in 4 different languages, and a third of the pages were written by people who don't even know how to change a tire. We have to do all this while balancing a pencil on our nose. I'm exaggerating a little but...only a little. This isn't to excuse guys who should know better or are being obstinate, but it's just a request for a bit of patience and compassion. That's all. Thank you.",

I feel like it's easier to give up on dating/sex because every man I seem to come into contact with is just awful in bed, severely addicted to porn or just learned everything from porn (so basically knows nothing) and is also too proud or lazy to make an effort to please me even just once. Got my ex of 2 years off countless times and he literally only managed it for me once in that whole time...I'm just so sad and exhausted from the process. They say all this stuff about being chivalrous gentlemen and really do it on dates and when we're together, but then when it comes down to sex it's always just so tragic and selfish. There's no passion or patience, it's always robotic, boring and ALL about them. If I even pipe up that I need just a bit more, it's taken as such a goddamn chore or insult. I'm just so bitter and so done with it, honestly how am I ever supposed to feel good without porn and a vibrator at this point \\*sigh\\*",

Basically desensitized himself by not gripping at all. Also meant he could look at hentai while he did so. \n\nSpeaking of hentai, the first time we slept together, oh boy. I warned him that my chest doesn't have much feeling, like at all, but other stuff does. All he wanted to was play with my chest. And, after I'd obviously had a good time (later), he was confused since my chest hadn't had any discharge? Because that happens in the stuff he liked to read?\n\nNot that there weren't more issues. Turns out, he didn't like fluids. He is straight, but thought vaginas were gross because of how wet they would get. Wouldn't finger me, wouldn't go down on me, wouldn't even use a thumb on the outside while I was riding. Didn't like receiving blow jobs because of desensitization issues above. All he wanted to do was put together my boobs and jerk off into the middle of them. \n\nWe slept together twice or three times before I just couldn't anymore.

            "text": "I feel for the ladies here.\n\nI watched a lot of porn before I lost my virginity. I did all the porn tropes with my first girlfriend, and later down the road, I came to realize...\n\nPorn is sex in the same way WWE wrestling is fighting. Is it combat? Sure, because there are two people (or more) kicking, grabbing and jumping on each other, but it's all an over produced show.\n\nA 40 minute porn scene takes four hours to shoot. A lot of it is downtime. The girl's make-up is professionally done with a certain style (producers ask for \"soft, glamourous, pretty\"), foundation is placed on the girls to hide dimples, cellulite and other blemishes and extremely bright lights are put on them (during the scene lights are so bright sometimes performers can't fully see the person they are fucking).\n\nPorn stars are performers who engage in performance fucking, designed to *look good on camera* and get you off. Spanking, crazy positions, riding a dick to break it.\n\nI think of Dan Savage when he said \"Sex is about communication. Asking your partner what they want, and doing anything for them...*within reason*\" (he also said \"dot dot dot\" where the punctuation was placed).\n\nThis is where it gets tough for the ladies. Women have a hard time openly expressing what they are not OK with when with men because they are always discouraged from open expression, and the fear the guy will get up and leave when he finds out he can't jack-knife powerbomb you after cumming in your eyeballs.\n\nEDIT: My writings on body make-up were an assumption and upon further research, full body coverage is not standard practice and touching up is being phased out by major studios who are now shooting in 4K, since the make-up will smear and the smear easily visible. Many updoots and awards in, I did some research and felt compelled to do this edit.\n\nI apologize for this oversight, but I stand by the intent of this post. Porn distorts our view of sex as it relates to us as human beings. Sex is a natural act. Porn is an entertainment product, and is now delivered at light speed to any of our devices in a global store that never closes, even on Christmas, and requires nothing from us but our time and energy.\n\nBut porn sex is not real sex. Real sex is about delivering pleasure to your partner in a way that gives her genuine physical pleasure, and taking joy in delivering it and the experience that is the privilege of having the gift that is her consenting and naked body.\n\nEND EDIT...\n\n>!MIC DROP!<\n\nEDIT: I can assure you I am not trying to get more updoots or awards, but there is another aspect of porn that is especially brutal to women.\n\nWeaponized big dicks. Being large in porn is important because it is easier to see on camera, but many videos have men with massive cocks brought it as powerful destroyers, bringing a petite size 00 that can't talk her way onto a roller coaster to be faced with a man built like an NFL lineman and packing what looks like a python cleverly camouflaged as a penis. It's no different from having the guards throw a feeble peasant woman into the Rancor pit to be slaughtered for the amusement of the emperor.\n\nForeplay. But it doesn't always take place in bed. It's putting a post-it in her purse that says \"You're my girl for a reason ;)\", giving her a message when she gets home before asking her about her day, and for her birthday, surprising her by cleaning her apartment with a candlelit dinner ready and waiting for her. It's making her feel special and making sure she knows that all day, every day, she matters and doesn't have to be somebody else, and no matter what her boss or her rivals may think of her, you're always her man and always on her side, and you will never say or do anything to hurt her.\n\nForeplay, to me, is not the bullshit classes of my major or the pre-game leading up to the Super Bowl. It is the Super Bowl, and anything beyond that is raising those twenty-five-pounds of sterling silver high above my head that is now lighter than the confetti on my victorious shoulders.\n\nIt's like walking on the beach on a perfect night. You have no need to rush because the feeling alone is perfect, and when she tells you she's ready, you dive in, and let the waves take you into the sea...\n\nEND (another) EDIT.\n\n>!Ladies, he's single!!<\n\ntl;dr - Don't just stare at it?

(haha so relaxing to be yelled at, am i right?). i said “can we change positions?” so he did, but he did so without looking at me, he wouldn’t touch or kiss me, just had his head turned to the side as if i wasn’t there. eventually he got inside me a little and started saying “you’re a freak, aren’t you?” i didn’t reply. he got incredibly upset and said “aren’t you?” so i just shrugged. (also to be noted he got me very high before all this, so i wasn’t in my right mind). i told him i was 19 because i was, though i looked fairly young at the time, sometimes people think i’m 15. he stopped during the middle of sex to say he wasn’t into it because i was a little kid, to which i responded “i’m literally 19.” and he looked at me doubtfully. (if he didn’t believe me in the first place, why was he trying to fuck me so badly???). afterwards he asked if i was really a virgin. i literally bled on his sheets....and he had to clean it up, so i’m still not sure why he would even ask that. he clearly had absolutely no understanding of women’s bodies or consent in general. he was 21. had so much ptsd from this experience. you can pretend women are sex dolls all you want but it’ll never make it true. it’s like he thought it was all this big game like in porn where the girl pretends to be a virgin or lies about her age blah blah blah and he was upset that i wasn’t following whatever script he had in his head. also i think that because i wanted to have sex in his mind this meant i couldn’t possibly be a virgin.",

How wet she gets and her reactions are a dead giveaway.\n\nStart by going down, use your tongue and lips and be gentle, gently lick her clit and slowly flick it up and down, swirl around it softly and slowly and then , again, *gently* use your finger to rub the clit in a circular motion while you continue with your tongue up and down the vulva. If she's not practically arching her back and holding her breath, you are probably doing it too roughly. Some women do like that but it's best to check beforehand.\n\nAlso most women don't much enjoy having fingers stuffed up in there until they are wet, and even then, you only need the tip of 1 finger to *slowly and gently* caress the entry of their vagina, if it's not wet, carry on with the oral. I personally don't stop the oral and foreplay until my wife has achieved an orgasm or has come (yes, there is a difference between the 2 for women, for men, come and orgasm are interchangeable, women can come many times throughout sex, but will likely only have a few orgasms).\n\nThat being said, if a woman really wants to have sex, they'll usually be wet before you've even started. Some kissing, rubbing against each other and talking dirty is often enough to get started.\n\nAnd before anyone r/ihavesex 's me, we have been together 14 years, and she is one of 3 women I have slept with in total.

My theory is they had to close their eyes and imagine what sex was like and imagine all the things that might feel good or might make a girl feel good. They might have had a JC Penney catalogue, but much of their sexual understanding arose from their imaginations. \n\nThe under 40 crowd tends to be less imaginative and far less creative. It’s like they’re simply emulating what they’ve seen on porn hub and rely on friction. Something is definitely lost in translation. They generally have a harder time reaching climax, and the intensity of non-sexual contact doesn’t seem to register.",

This extends to your partner as well. Talk to your partner about what they like and don’t just assume it based on what you’ve seen… same goes for their reasoning as to why they might like it. \n\nFor me, I shave semi-often. Why? Not because of porn but because my body hair makes me itch and sometimes I pick at it which can cause sores. So it’s just better for me to shave and not to mention it is easier for me to clean after my time of the month rather than trying to wash and make sure I got all of the dried blood and gunk out. It isn’t from porn, it’s just for my own personal hygiene. \n\nJust seriously talk to your partner. Another thing is that you two may be sexually incompatible and that is perfectly fine.

We were 16 I think, and we went to her house cause her parents were gone for the weekend. When she started to blow me, she went down too far, too fast, which simultaneously bent my wiener while making this awful GAWK GAWK sound. It was so uncomfortable I pulled her up and laid her back to go down on her to escape the dick massacre. When I was doing my thing on her lady parts, she kept making riley reid type comments like “oh FUCK yeah spread my little pussy”, and “tongue fuck me hard daddy”, so I stopped that. Tried just having regular missionary sex and she got kind of offended and asked why I didn’t want to piledrive her, which I had no idea how to do at the time, but she was so pretty like why wouldn’t I want to look into her eyes and kiss her and stuff while boning? So I tried wrapping it up so I could just be done with the awkward experience and then she started asking “you gunna cum for me? Huh daddy? You gunna cum??” Which made it incredibly hard to concentrate, like wtf I’m not your dad and if your dad did this shit to you I’m gunna lose my boner all together. But just as I was about to cum she asked if I was and I said yeah so she didn’t this strange breakdance move, kinda like the worm and got down below my wiener and was like “cum on my face, oh yeah baby, cum all over my pretty face” and I just couldn’t do it. It was way too weird and I like awkwardly stopped and stared getting dressed and she asked what was wrong and I said I didn’t want to cum on her face and her response was “that means you don’t find me attractive, so don’t like me, if you liked me you’d want to cum on my face.” She started to cry, I was so weirded out by the whole ordeal I just left and walked to the bus stop, I was supposed to stay there that night, which would have been full of sex but she just kinda ruined it. In retrospect I think it’s what made me not like porn, which is good now because all my wife has to do is change her shirt and I’m roaring and ready to go.",

She met him when she was young and naive.  Fell in love.  A couple of years before they had sex. Moved in.  He was a freeloader.  He conned her into moving from a small town to a major city.  No job; she had two.  Her name on the lease.  Her name on the car loan. She cooked and cleaned.  Sex on rare occasions and missionary only.  No going down on her. \n\nHe would go to parties without her, because of her night job.  She finally demanded to be taken along.  She took a night off.  The party was all guys, but no overt sexual activity.  Her boyfriend seemed to be flirting with some of the men.  This finally got her suspicions up.\n\nShe rented a bunch of porn to \"spice things up.  Girl/guy, he doesn't react.  Girl/girl, he's still limp.  Two guys, rock hard.\n\nEnd of story. She didn't throw him out because he was gay.  She really loved him. He left on his own  to move in with another guy.  He probably thought he had a better meal ticket.  The new guy tossed his act pretty quick.  He asked to come back.  He turned on the pressure.  She was torn to pieces.  It took her over one year of lost sleep, lost hair, lost weight, lost tears to finally get him out of system.\n\nThere's nothing \"wrong\" about being gay.
