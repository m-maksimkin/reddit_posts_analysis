I eventually found out others are also experiencing this. This is a website I came across while trying to find some understanding of what was very perplexing at first.\n\n>\"Many people from all walks of life have begun to see 11:11 in various places, especially on their digital clocks, phones, and computers. As this begins to happen more frequently, many of us may begin to ask ourselves “What does this mean?” and “Why am I seeing this now?” \"This synchronicity usually provokes the person who is noticing this phenomenon to search for answers or to feel they are being guided by angels or a supernatural force. Because people can begin to wake in the night to see some of these number combinations, it is also linked to being a “wake up call.” [https://omtimes.com/2014/09/1111-biblical-prophecy-11th-hour-workers/](https://omtimes.com/2014/09/1111-biblical-prophecy-11th-hour-workers/)\n\nFor me this experience has coincided with coming across the following which confirmed my spiritual beliefs.\n\nProphecy is about 1/4 of the Bible letting us know what will happen in the future. Jesus stated in John 14:29\n\n>“And now I have told you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe.”  \n>  \n>\"And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:\" Acts 2:17\n\nThese are 2 spaces I have created that covers a good portion of what I have come across over the last couple of years concerning the last days we are living in and how to have hope about the future.

For some reason, I honestly don't know why, we're generally allowed to wear slacks and a shirt, so I did. We also don't get a ton of patient interaction, but, sometimes we'll go rounding with the doctors (it's getting much more common). It's fun and it makes us available for drug questions.\n\nWell, I got to thinking and thought, \"What if, during rounds, one of these patients vomits on you? What will you do then?\" So I started keeping a change of clothes in my desk drawer in the pharmacy. This payed off, but not how I thought (warning, the next part is sad).\n\nDuring rounds one day we were seeing a patient. She was a lovely woman, about 45 years old, mother of three. I knew her. The doctor knew her. We all knew her because she was a nurse that worked with us. A damn fine nurse, too. She had thrown a pulmonary embolism and was in the ICU on a heparin drip (heparin is used to clear clots, which a pulmonary embolism is). She'd been there for a few days and was starting to improve. Things were looking good.\n\nWhile we were in her room discussing what her treatment course was going to look like her oxygen levels dropped. Then her heart rate dropped. Then she coded. During codes, pharmacists man the drug cart, so I grabbed the crash cart and got the epinephrine ready. In the 20 seconds it took me to do that, she had started to fountain blood out of her mouth. Her lung vasculature was damaged by the clot and had ruptured. The heparin didn't help.\n\nSide note: medically, we didn't do anything wrong. We followed treatment guidelines. Sometimes, shit happens and it's really unfair and shitty.\n\nWe did CPR for a long time, I forget how long, but it was at least 36 minutes because we went through 12 epis and you give them every 3-5 minutes. We gave her protamine, too, which reverses heparin. In the end, there wasn't anything we could do. She bled too fast.\n\nAnyway, at some point in all that I ended up with blood on my pants and shirt, so I was grateful for my change of clothes.\n\nThat's a lot. It's the first time I've told this story, other than to my wife. It was one of the most horrible things I've ever seen and was deeply unfair.",

I guess I'm just used to reddit delivering these absolutely obscure heroic stories, so I'm starting to think redditors aren't actually good at overthinking, OR, that when we do overthink, those rare scenarios actual never occur.\n\nAs an example, i keep a fire extinguisher in my car, but never had to use it, but I'd still not consider that overthinking.  Even if I had to use it!   That's not overthinking, just thinking.  I'm not patting myself on the back for carrying a fire extinguisher.\n\nGive some good examples of OVERthinking.  Like if you engineered a fire extinguisher to automatically go off in your car in the event of a fire, AND A FIRE ACTUALLY happened, AND your homemade fire suppression system triggered.   We will accept that maybe it didn't actually work to put out the fire, just the fact that you OVERTHUNK it and designed and built it.   THAT'S overthinking.\n\nSee where I'm going with this, there's got to be some genuinely mind blowing super geniuses out there?",

He would stay up really late at night to the point I'd go to bed earlier than him (for context I'm a night owl, he goes to sleep early rises early). I would lay in bed thinking \"He's gotta be cheating on me. He's definitely cheating on me. Oh God don't be that way don't think like that. Stop.\" \n\nWell one night I go to bed at 10pm, he's still on his computer playing a game, the usual. I wake up at 1am because I'm hot, remember that I hadn't turned the a/c back on from earlier that day. Decided to go turn it on. Noticed he's still not in bed. I think \"He must have fell asleep downstairs.\" not unusual. Then I hear his computer, him typing away, clicking, a notification sound going off. Okay, also not unusual, he might be playing with his friends and instead of voice chatting (because he gets extremely loud) he's just using fb messenger (the old days before discord). He sees me and just kinda looks like \"Oh fuck\" I say \"hey it's really late? You coming to bed?\" He just says \"Uh yea.\" I ask him if he's playing with his friends, and if they're still trying to get out of ELO hell (LoL). He just says \"Yea.\" Vaguely. \n\nI just kinda go \"huh...okay\" and go back upstairs. Two hours later he comes up...wakes me up... and says \"I need to tell you something.\" I'm thinking maybe he was playing a tournament or something and won or whatever. I was not expecting him to say \"I want this to come from me. I've been talking to this woman. She asked me to come see her next weekend and when I refused, she said she was going to message you and tell you. So I thought you should know from me.... I already blocked her...but I'm sure she remembers my name and can look you up.... I....I'm sorry...I don't know what to do but I didn't want it to go that far.\"\n\nI just look at him and say \"Well, where's your computer? You can report her for harassing you. And I'll block her on my account too.\" I'm like, really not surprised at all. \n\nHe tells me everything and is shocked at how calm I was. I tell him \"I'm going home for awhile. I don't know if I'm coming back. I need a break from you. I don't know why you'd do this, I feel like it's my fault. But I'm just going to go home.\"\n\nI left for almost two months. We worked through a lot. I told him that unless he can figure out why he felt the need to reach out to someone else in an intimate way, and not his wife who is always open and wanting him to talk to her about his feelings, don't talk to me. \n\nIt took him a few days. He wrote me a very long message explaining things. We ended up going to therapy. We worked a lot of it out. \n\nOverthinking like that and telling myself \"If it happens, this is what is going to happen.\" helped me cope when it did happen. I knew exactly what to do, who to call, and where I was gonna go. \n\nIt might be because my dad cheated on my mom and she had no type of plan. She kicked my dad out, but was still a mess. She was completely absent from us kids. She even just left us at our grandma's with our dad and just left for a few days. Didn't tell us why or where she was. I think just that experience really made me think \"Of I have to leave, this is where I'll go, who I'll call, and what I need to do first.\"",

The more I read up on pandemics and their history as I grew up and lived with that fear, the more likely I came to feel it was. \n\nWhen Covid was just a thing in Wuhan, I had heard it could be transmissible for weeks before it showed any signs and symptoms, and in the modern day of fast, worldwide travel constantly occurring on a mass scale, I right away felt like ‘there’s no way this thing won’t become as uncontained as possible in no time’. \n\nI right away started to say that it was going to spread worldwide, be a serious issue, and that people here (in the States) wouldn’t handle it well or act reasonably and would panic and buy everything off of the shelves at first and then immediately not take it seriously at all and call you weak if you do take it seriously. Every one I know laughed at me, rolled their eyes, and told me I’m a crazy germaphobe. And then literally every single last detail of every single thing that’s happened here in the US - from how bad it got exactly to the early panic buying days to the politicizing of the virus and the way Trump used that to his advantage to how long it’s been around and how things might start wrapping up and getting back to normal a bit if we can vaccinate - all happened EXACTLY the way I called it play by play like a year and some months ago. \n\nSo idk if I’d call everything that’s happened ‘unlikely’ really, but at the mental level (and even partially the level of resources/taking precautions the experts tell us to take well before the experts began to tell us to take them - I already had masks/etc. and was social distancing before that was a ‘thing’ here), I’ve kinda been gearing up for this my whole life in some ways.",

What I was having extreme anxiety about was the fact that I had to move the rifles from the house to the car in my urban neighborhood.  Like I literally rehearsed that moment in my head 6 times.  Just have to wrap the guns in the towel. Walk them out to the vehicle.  Stick them in the trunk.  What is there to worry about?!\n\nSo I get those guns wrapped in the towel.  Exit the basement door, walk through my driveway, cross in the grass of my front lawn...  And a guy makes a beeline for me from across the street.\n\nNot wanting to be holding guns while I talk to someone, I put them down on the lawn in front of me.  But I notice that one of the handles is now sticking out of the towel and pretty noticeable.  My foot isn't doing a great job of getting the handle covered...\n\nThe guy asks me if I have any lighter fluid.  My brain is firing with anxiety now and I can't even think straight.  I see my partner exit the house with an armload and drop it in the trunk.  I yell out to him and ask if he knows if we have any lighter fluid.  (because my brain is not processing what is happening anymore)\n\nMy partner not knowing what is going on heads in the house to look for lighter fluid.\n\nMe and this strange man awkwardly stand in my front lawn, making horrible small talk.  Like the weather, \"how's it going\", etc.  The guns still sit at my feet and are no longer well disguised.\n\nIt felt like ten minutes passed like that, terribly long.  Just when I start to think things will hopefully resolve soon, or this guy will get bored and leave.  I see a cop car drive by.  Then casually park down the block.\n\nThen the cop gets out and walks up to us.  Me still standing on the lawn with reproduction realistic looking non marked guns at my feet, sticking out of their towel disguise, and this stranger standing in front of me.\n\nCop walks up, stands next to the guy, spends a few seconds taking this whole scene in, and then turns to the guy and says, \"So I hear you've been asking all over the neighborhood for lighter fluid.  Let's take a little walk and talk about it.\"\n\nThe both turn and walk down the block.\n\nI stand there stunned for a moment, then grab the sloppy pile of guns and towel, run to the car, throw them in the back and close the hatch.  Partner comes out and says he can't find lighter fluid and then also makes the connection finally to ask why the guy needs it anyways.  Turned out the poor guy was having a mental breakdown and was going to burn his car with the fluid.\n\nAnd that is the story of time I just needed 10 seconds to get a pile of guns in my car.",

The last one is what came in handy.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the worst case scenarios befell our family two years ago. My oldest daughter disclosed that she had been molested by my then FIL. I went into full auto-pilot here: took my daughter to a safe room, had family pick up my dog and youngest daughter, made sure she didn’t wash her hands. When she had to use the restroom, I asked her not to wipe. We didn’t change her clothes, we didn’t have her brush her teeth. \n\nThe DNA evidence they were able to collect off of her put him in prison and will keep him there. \n\nSurprisingly, this has helped my overthinking. We all are getting a lot of therapy now and I’ve started to learn that it’s ok to not be for everything. Sometimes life sucks, and most of the time it’s completely out of our control.",

At one point our teams hits this task where everyone has to draw or write something (don’t really remember). But there’s only two pens, about ten people per team, and another team just showed up.\n\nWith one pen assigned to each team, it’s going slow… until… YOU GET A PEN! YOU GET A PEN! EVERYBODY GETS A PEN!\n\nOur team screams through the task because we can all write simultaneously, while the other team’s left plodding along with their one pen. We eventually win. Who’s weird now?!\n\nEDIT: For those concerned about cheating. I believe the lack of pens was oversight but the event planners, not a deliberate means of handicapping teams. There was a staff members monitoring that particular station and they didn’t intervene. Our victory was sanctioned and still stands.\n\nEDIT 2: Some people have expressed concern over the possibility of my getting impaled by all these writing utensils. Rest assured that, this 100% has happened to me. I have absolutely impaled legs and fingertips multiple times. It was terrible.",

It had spare clothes, a card to a bank account my ex husband didn’t have access too and didn’t know I had, some cash, several weeks of my meds, a brief medical history with dr’s info in case I was hurt and had to go to a hospital, etc. I hid it in the spare tire wheel space of my car. The top layer was just clothing that I had in some shopping bags. It looked like I had bought clothes without him knowing. Anyway, he found it one day. Luckily, he just took the shopping bag out and got real pissed off. Left everything else. \n\nAnyway, I never got to use it for myself (because he got arrested thank God) but afterwards I noticed a friend had the look of being abused. It was pretty clear what was happening. After gently approaching her she acknowledged that she was being abused but didn’t feel like she could leave. So I helped her hook up with a domestic violence victim advocate but I also had her change my name in her phone to a pizza shop. I made her a “go right now bag” for her and put it in my car. \n\n30 days later I got a call for a large cheese pizza with extra sauce. I called 911, drove to her house, beat the cops there, and heard her screaming bloody murder. I knocked the window out and climbed in. Saw her husband with a knife with blood all over it. I just ran and grabbed her. Unlocked the door got her into the car. Had the phone on me the whole time. I had a first aid kit with a ton of wound gauze so I just pressed that in and waited as the husband tried to take out the our window. Finally I told the 911 operator that I was gonna drive down a ways. The cops showed up. Arrested the husband. Took my friend to the hospital. Saved her life and since her home was a crime scene she needed the “go right now” bag.\n\nI keep a generic one in my car at all times. I’ve used more than one for more than a few woman and one for a man. Once you’ve been through it, you can see it. I never want to be unprepared. Just in case.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the award.

They canned every vegetable from their garden. They had more than one heat source. Two that did not require electricity. There was extra gas and oil. They grew up in the mountains. Back in their day weeks could go by without supplies coming up the mountain due to weather, road problems, poverty. The depression really changed how a lot of people lived. I think this pandemic will do something similar.  Once I had kids i found myself doing the same things minus the canning of vegetables.  I am not a doomsday prepper but i have the makings of one.

The nine year old was happy that she got some alone time with mom while I cleaned up her sister and myself. \n\nAlso related: the same toddler went through a phase some months later where she had more potty accidents, so I started packing extra pairs of her panties every time we went out to the park. I used reusable grocery bags to bring that day's toys we well as snacks/drinks, etc. Most days she didn't need them, and I replaced them in her dresser. One night as I was buying my groceries on my way home from work the bagger said in a very concerned voice, \"Do you know that there is a pair of little girls panties in your bag?\" I think he and the cashier were concerned I was a pedophile.

If I fall forward, I can probably catch myself with my forehead if I do it just right.\n\nObviously, if I continued thinking I would have realized how stupid that was. At the time it sounded like a great idea that would totally work. So I never slipped on campus, but some friends and I were horsing around on the ice in a frozen pool. Of course my hands are in my hoodie pocket. I go to shoulder bump one of them and they push back a little and my feet start sliding. I'm falling face first and my hands do not move. I recall my genius idea coming back to me and land directly on my forehead. The collective gasp from all my friends when I stood up is something I'll always remember. I split my forehead from brow to brow and had to be in a Christmas play that year with stitches in my face. Now I have a scar between my brows that makes me look like I'm always scowling.

I had a pill which contained Tylenol and other two stuff but of course he did not know the ingredients because he never took that pill before. I was ready to hand him the pill and it occurred to me randomly just like that to ask him if he’s allergic to something. My other friends who were with us were like “ ugh, you’re starting again with that anaphylaxis thing” and blah blah, but turns out my friend was ANAPHYLACTIC TO TYLENOL ( which he knew about and it was his only allergy ) but he just didn’t ask what the pill contains. I scolded him then and since then he tells me he always makes sure before taking any pill it doesn’t contain Tylenol. He was really irresponsible given the fact that he doesn’t carry any allergy medication just in case and we were far away from a hospital.

I was a *much* more experienced hiker than anyone else there, so I figured I wouldn’t mind the extra few pounds at the bottom of my pack as insurance against being yelled at (aside: this and similar incidents are one of many things that has since led me to realize how messed up a lot of my upbringing was).\n\nWhen we were on our way back, and 2–3 miles from the trailhead, someone breathlessly came up from behind the group I was walking with and asked us to wait because someone’s boots had fallen apart and they were trying to get them back together with tape.\n\nI jogged back, and my extra pair of socks over hers made my spare boots fit pretty well, and she made it back without the debilitating blisters she probably would have had otherwise, and I got to be the day’s hero :)",

But I got enough thumbs-up from mac drivers to know I'm doing the right thing.\n\n- My biggest rule is: Don't pass a transport truck at the same time as the vehicle ahead of you.\nThere's plenty of space for 3 vehicles next to a mac, but if one of them swerves, you're all dead. (Often this happens in the fast lane, and assholes behind me honk to speed up and pass the mac. They can fucken wait 8 seconds.)\n\n- Second is stay either behind, or ahead of a transport truck who is in another lane. Don't drive next to them unless passing, and especially don't stick around in their blind spot.\nIf you can't see the driver in his side mirrors, chances are he can't see you. (The amount of times I've seen people get forced into the shoulder or ditch by a trucker or bus who didn't see them sitting in the blind spot for 15mins...)\n\n- When you do need to pass a mac, do it fast, and don't pull ahead of them again until you're far ahead of them, so they don't have to brake to not crush your ass.\n\n- lastly, and this comes from growing up in Northern Ontario where logging truck accidents are common but somehow people still drive like idiots: Don't stay behind a logging truck longer than you have to, and don't fucking tailgate any flatbed or logger. That's asking for a beheading. (Or the Wash treatment. Don't be a leaf on the wind.)\n\nAll of these things have given me plenty of time to swerve or stop before hitting other vehicles who were not following these rules.

I’ve been through times where I could barely afford food, there is a level of hunger that becomes a constant dull ache in the background, and it’s hard to sleep with an empty stomach. Going through that changes you. I always promised myself that if I saw someone who was deeply hungry I’d give the protein bar to that person. One day on the subway a woman came on, very politely asking for food. No fake story, no drama, sober. Everyone ignored her. She was exhausted with hunger, I could feel her fatigue. She was rail thin and I gave her a protein bar, warning her that it wasn’t the tastiest but very nutritious. She quietly said “yeah, I know.” With a sigh and took the bar.

Specifically, the first  recommended method to intervene was to interact only with the victim and just talk to them/lead them away without confronting or acknowledging the harasser. This stuck in my mind and I definitely played many an imaginary scenario in my head of how I’d do it.\n\nLo and behold, my bf and I were on the NY subway and a man comes storming down the car screaming “I dare you to fucking look at me” at everyone after telling some poor dude on the other end to kill himself for looking at him probably. Very angry/unhinged, looking to pick a fight. Unfortunately the woman next to him standing in the corner must’ve glanced up for a second and he started screaming at her next, calling her a bitch, etc. No one was doing anything, it being NYC, but I could tell my boyfriend was about to confront the guy. I knew we didn’t know if he potentially had a knife on him or something worse, so having “mentally prepared” for this situation, I quickly called out to the woman instead and asked her if she wanted to sit next to me and repeated that a few times. She shook her head no though as I think she didn’t wanna get any closer to this guy or move past him but it distracted him and he was like “yea go over there” and then nothing else really happened until we stopped at the next station and he got off. I went to check on her after but she seemed local/used to antics. \n\nSo at the end of the day it’s not like I saved the day or anything lol but I’m glad I did what I did instead of my bf or anyone else confronting the guy who could’ve potentially been violent.

Someone decided to send only part of my message to the owner/developer of the private server and got me banned.  After going back and forth in dms with the owner for like 30 minutes about how the information he has is incorrect and that he would easily be able to check if he actually had logs (which he would constantly claim that he had logs, though it was VERY evident by the end of this debacle that he, in fact, didn't), I found screenshots of the messages that I had sent in chat to him and he proceeded to unban me.  He decided to put some flag on the backend for his mods (I don't remember exactly what he said the flag was, just something very bad like final warning, despite me never having any prior issues within the game) and still proceeded to tell people publicly on the discord server that I had done something that I wasn't supposed to, despite it obviously being false; however, at least I am no longer banned.",

For the whole time it seemed redundant, yet on the last snow day (as everything was melting), a homeless guy right in front of me slipped on something (I don't know if it was even ice) and hurt his head pretty badly. After a little treatment and encouragement to not mess with the dressing, the ambulance arrived to treat him properly.\n\nAnother time I brought it around to a convention when meeting with (now-former) friends. It seemed to me like a good idea when you're out into less-known territory. One of the group, after doing some foolish things while drunk, hurt her wrist after not sticking the landing. It normally wouldn't have been as much of an issue, but a lot of the group were reliant on her driving them back home.

So my imaginative overthinking child mind started formulating a scenario that the truck beside me will hit us and knock our car off the bridge and die. So I got scared and took my seatbelt off and squeeze to the right side where my mother and sister were sitting. The truck got closer and closer and it hit the left side of the car where I was leaning on, thankfully we didn't got knocked off the bridge and die. The left side of the car was pretty smashed and if I didn't overthink that the truck will hit us, I would've been dead in seconds. Lol I was quite traumarized that whenever I got into the car I don't put my seat belt anymore and I would lean to the other side if a truck got closer to us.

One day, due to some other activity on campus that involved protesting against issues with our administration, our campus security started doing room checks and I was in my room, didn't hear the knock, and they started to key into my room. Cue my almost instinctive actions, getting across my room and jamming a shoe under the door before they could actually unlock the lower half, since I kept both the doorknob and the deadbolt locked at all times. Hear a voice from outside asking if everything was okay, and I said yes but that they could not enter my room.

We went together to an event and in the after party we got a little bit drunk and I offered her to drive her home. As things got intense in my car and we were both ready to go all the way, I started picturing that if we had sex, she could probably get pregnant and I was going to get stuck with her, we were both young adults and religious, so getting someone knocked up was enough reason for me at the time to marry someone since that was \"the right thing to do\". On top of that, we had spend our money in a club so no extra cash for condoms or a motel for that matter. So I stopped the whole making out inside the car and drove her home. The next month she met with me to invite me to her wedding and confessed me she was pregnant from her boyfriend... and I don't know why she mentioned me this, but she told me she got knocked up the same week we went out.

My mind went into overdrive about what the possible fallout of this could be, and decided the wisest course of action would be to prep like we were headed toward the next Great Depression.\n\nWe’d just closed on our first home in late 2019, and finally had a stable space of our own. I continued to monitor the situation, and as incidents of the virus to increase, we took action by purchasing a chest freezer; I did a shit ton of research about gardening in harsh environments and conducted numerous cycles of soil testing, and we overhauled our yard into an abundant kitchen garden with loads of different vegetables, fruits, and herbs and flowers. We stocked up on dried goods and cupboard staples, restocked our storage water and all emergency kits; we basically we went into hardcore prepper mode for what appeared to be a disaster.  We made sure our solar panel system was fully functional (to offset the increased consumption costs we’d likely incur by being home all the time).  Instead of hoarding paper goods like toilet paper, we bought a bidet attachment and purchased a modest amount of toilet paper so as not to put any additional strain on supply chains. \n\nBy the time the first mid-March lockdown rolled around in 2020, we’d already hunkered down and had avoided most public places for several weeks (save for a trip to the nursery and dispensary, fully masked in n95s in late Feb. 2020).\n\nEven with all of that preparation, the pandemic has been a punch to the gut... but we were exceedingly lucky.  My hyper-vigilance has caused me a tremendous amount of anxiety during periods of my life, but in this instance it literally kept us safe and protected us from being exposed to COVID, and saved us from unnecessarily contracting the virus and passing it on to others unknowingly.

I remember on New Year's Eve 2019 reading about this mystery virus, within a week I was carrying hand sanitiser everywhere and using it following going to the shops or public transport because I was starting to get concerned. I couldn't see it being successfully contained. When I told people I was feeling worried about it, I was mostly either laughed at or told it was nothing to worry about. I even asked my doctor about it after an appointment some time in February and was told it wasn't anything to be concerned about, only the very frail were getting any complications.\n\nBy the time it had started spreading and people were beginning to realise this might actually be something to worry about, I'd been \"over thinking\" it for weeks and making little preparations (I made sure I had a good amount of all of my medication, had a few emergency meals in the freezer incase the shops were really difficult to get into at any point - that paid off quite well). Just little preparations, not that it really eased my anxiety much.\n\nOnce it was announced we were going into lock down suddenly my household didn't find my concern so funny anymore. Mentally I'd been prepared for that happening for a while at that point, which I'm actually quite grateful for because I think it really helped prevent my mental health taking such a dip during that time. For me, since I'd been so concerned and following it so closely for a couple of months at that point, it almost felt like a relief to see it get taken seriously and to slow down the spread of it.",

And he *insisted* that we would have our entire way of life uprooted and there’d be quarantines and closures. I rolled my eyes at the last one. He ordered 40 N95 masks in early January and found, at that point hard to find, kids fabric masks for our daughter. At the end of February, we bought a deep freezer, and he asked me to start planning a menu of food that could last us for months if we couldn’t leave the house. We also live in a hurricane-prone area, so I figured, hey, we can also stock for hurricanes, so no big loss if he’s overreacting. We bought multiple bottles of hand sanitizer and spray cleaner whenever we went out for weeks. Never cleaning out a store, but two or three at a time here and there. When we went on our final big run, it was March 3, 2020. We got to Sam’s, and he was worried that the stores had already been overrun because the lot was so crowded. I told him that this was just what Sam’s looks like on a weekend, and it’s fine. The only thing we couldn’t find was sanitizer. \n\nAnd we all know how this turned out. He was completely right, and even underestimated the death toll. I really thought this was one of his anxiety manifestations, and that it wouldn’t be so bad. Nope, I was wrong. He was right.

Their dog had never show aggression before, but was known to be nervous, it unexpectedly lunged and pulled the lead from their hand. They were very apologetic, paid for all treatment, and got help & training for their dog. As the owners had small children themselves they were as upset as we were and took it very seriously.\n\nLong story short my over preparation helped improve a bad situation, but so did the dog owners accountability.",

When I got to the ER (after much convincing because my parents thought I was being dramatic), I told the ER nurse I had appendicitis and needed surgery immediately. They told me to calm down and it was likely just an ovarian cyst. \n\nGuess who had an appendectomy the same day and missed the wedding? Had I not obsessively been thinking about the symptoms, I may have had a ruptured appendix.",

Looking back I don’t know why this was shocking, but I didn’t trust him at all and I regularly voiced that to all of my friends. Unfortunately it was a very “boy who called Wolf” situation because everyone thought I was just being mean and didn’t like another guy coming into the friend group. \n\nThis went on for a few months until one night he hosted a gathering that I didn’t end up going to. He got all of the young girls drunk that night and he was the only male at the gathering. Thankfully all of my girl friends left the gathering but one of our mutual friends stayed (she was a bit older and also not a very mature person so this isn’t shocking.) Anyways as you might have guessed, he got super touchy and inappropriate with the one girl who stayed and we had to go pick her up before he assaulted her further. It was super sad and after that he continues to hold a place of status in the congregation after marrying a MUCH older girl not even a year later. \n\nThe only good part of this story is that by the time this happened I had the sense to not say “I told you so” to all of my friends, although later someone was nice enough to acknowledge that I had said the whole time that I didn’t trust him.",

Her reaction made me imagine several of them coming up to me, but not to clean up their plates.\n\nSo I made a plan, grabbed a pipe resting against the wall, inflated a huge smiley face circular raft (Thankfully the pool had an air compressor or that would not have been an option) and put it out in front of me to hide the pipe and serve as a distraction.\n\nThen three of them showed up. The Mouth demanded to know what my problem was.

I did this for years and never even made a single friend while on vacation.\n\nBut one summer when my friends and I went on our annual camping trip, I befriended this girl who was my age at the campground. I was the only single one in my friend group so it wasn’t out of the ordinary for the couples to go do their own things while I hung around the cabin and just read a book for a couple hours.\n\nI don’t even remember how we initially started chatting, but over the course of the week I befriended and chatted daily with this girl who was staying in a camper at the same campground. With both of us being single, 20-something horny degenerates, we started flirting and talking dirty to each other.\n\nThe last night we were there, my friends all wanted to leave early rather than wait till morning but I said I’d stay behind since I drove separately anyway. I didn’t tell them, but I just wanted one more night to spend with this girl.\n\nI invited her over to the cabin and it didn’t take long for us to start making out. At one point she told me she wished we could have sex, and lo and behold I pulled out my condom that I had packed away exactly for a fantasy like this.\n\nTo this day, it’s the most unusual, movie-esque, and exciting sexual experience I’ve had.",

Other people just don’t have my capacity to consider realistically addressable problems and explore a solution approach towards a substantially better outcome. Or others don’t care to be prepared for reasonable things that could happen because…they just ride on luck or privilege. Or maybe they’re just OK accepting bad outcomes they could have reasonably (and comfortably) prevented.\n\nOther (popular) comments here show me people conflate overthinking with preparedness. It’s not over thinking to consider how you should handle a situation that could arise and where you wouldn’t be able to think clearly when/if it hits: how to exit a room or building if a fire occurred, or if an active shooter is around. Overthinking, to me only has a few forms that are actual negatives: stirring over a problem you won’t be able to solve or control, or you can clearly address and think through what to do when/if it occurs. For example: what if the wings fall off this plane at 30,000ft? Yeah, you won’t be able to do shit to increase your survival in the few minutes it takes to fall. “What if the kids don’t like the food?” is (usually) not an emergency. Buy a pepperoni pizza then. “What if my date doesn’t like my shirt?” - yup, back to nothing to do there. It’s probably your jokes anyways, and you don’t have time to learn new ones\n\nOtherwise, maybe if an overthinker reacts by spending way too much of a resource and creating another problem. Could be time like preventing a group from starting a trip because refusal to push forward on reasonable plans; or maybe spending extra money on what-ifs while not having enough for certain and immediate needs.\n\nVehicle safety, public and commercial travel safety has saved countless lives through “overthinking.” Capitalism is what stopped overthinkers from being able to solve the 737MAX sensor problem: “what if this sensor isn’t working? What will the plane do? How will the pilots know this is the problem and can they address it?” Turns out, twice, the answer was “they can’t.”",

I'd never been in this heat and exposure on a SUP before, and I can't remember if I ever was in this level of heat that wasn't in a tightly controlled situation with access to water and shade all around (like a public park). We were planning an out and back to a little island that would cover the whole four hours. About 1 1/2 hour out, 1 1/2 back in open ocean.\n\nI overthink water and food situations in hiking all the time. This is my greatest fear. To be stuck somewhere without enough food or water. I don't do calculations but I just go by gut and experience. It's always always better to have an extra gallon of water than not enough water, especially in hot conditions. On a SUP you can tuck extra gear usually under bungie cords on the board too. So nbd.\n\nAnyway..\n\nI had brought a 2 L platypus bag of water myself for the trip, but something told me for the 4 hour rental in the +100 F heat, that we needed twice as much. I insisted with my SO to buy more (despite the water being very over priced at like $4 per half liter) that he buy 2 L more of water at minimum (I think I might have had also like 1 L more in small water bottles so I had nearly 3 L? NVM I insisted we each drink a fair amount before going first as well). We nearly had a fight over it. I told him I was not going to leave the shoreline without it. He'd never been in a SUP before, whereas I had, but only in more temperate conditions. I begged and begged and even said I'd pay for it and he caved. We had like a 10 minute fight about it. \n\nSuffice to say, all that water was gone (we drank it all) before we even got to the halfway point, and tbh the entire trip was a bit reckless considering the heat (it was so hot even the ocean water brought no relief) afterwards my SO was thanking me profusely for insisting on bringing the extra water and we both were scared towards the end that we'd not make it. I didn't even think it would be all gone before the halfway point. But thank god I was paranoid.  \n\nOh wow I'm just remembering too - I absolutely insisted he wear a hat and a long sleeve shirt and put tons of sunscreen on in every part of his body. He also fought with me on that too (it's uneccessary! It will get in the way! I'll take it off!) but at the end was super super grateful. Again I was paranoid AF about heat stroke out there on the open water with no shade in that heat, again we were SUPing for almost 2 K out and back? No flares, no lifeguard. And I'd never done anything like this before. I'd only ever SUP'd on nice temperate or alpine lakes. \n\nI was just paranoid and that paranoia possibly prevented us from dying of heat stroke and enabled us to make it back to shore completely exhausted and determined to never do that again.",

Basically everyone is split up by cabins and the camp leader sings a little jingle, then on the last verse asks for the runner from each cabin to “bring him” an object. When he says the object, everyone runs to go get said object, and the first person to do so wins a single bean from a large jar of beans. (Not really a glamorous prize, sure, but you do it for the kudos). \n\nMe and my cabin of delinquents woke up and were excited for the game, this wasn’t the normal round, this was the last day of the week and so the councilors put their heads together and came up with a prize. \nAll the beans. \n\nWhoever won the match would win the entire jar of beans. This sent our middle school heads spinning. I was chosen as the runner and prepared to fight tooth and nail for whatever I was called to bring. \nThe song started, I took a sprinters start, prepared. As the tune resounded the lead singer slowed down the beat and called for...a AAA battery. \n\nIt was then that I new I had won. \n\nAs the other teams sprinted out the door towards their cabins several hundred meters away I calmly kneeled down by my daybag, which I always carried with me, then reached into one of the many pockets and thanked my stars I was such a prepper.

So, after a long day of unpacking and being indoors, we decided to take a quick break and walked down towards the main street for some food. Now, the catch is that we live at the top of a winding hill. There are two options for pedestrians walking into town: 1. Has steep steps and a relatively safe path for pedestrians, 2. Passes through a blind turn with what used to be a train station on the side people choose to walk on. Once you make it past this little blind curve, you are back onto a pedestrian pathway that leads into town.\n\nAnyhow, we took option 2, because, frankly, we didn't know at the time where option 1 let out into the town, if at all, and we were pretty hungry. So, here we are, walking along the blind curve which has the great brick wall of the old train station running past it. I look at this section and realize how genuinely dangerous this curve is, and said something offhanded, like, 'I wonder how often they have to repair the wall here when it rains? I don't think we should take this road with the baby.' My SO laughs and says something like, 'It's probably rarer than you think. You're always so anxious about these things.' \n\nAnyhow, fast forward a few days. We get some heavy rain to break up the sunny weather. It's been a miserable day outside, and my SO relents as he realizes we're low on milk and nappies and some other necessary supplies. So, off he heads, taking the road with the blind curve. When he returns, the first thing he says is, 'I guess you were right.' \n\nMe: 'Right about what?' \nHim: 'The Hulk made a visit to the train station.' \nMe: (confused after having forgotten the conversation from a few days before) 'What are you talking about?' \n\nSO whips out his phone and starts showing me the photos of a giant hole in the wall, the road littered with bits of broken car pieces, and broken brick everywhere. Apparently, my anxiety wasn't me just being crazy, it was spot on. Some car came around that blind curve too quickly and crashed through the wall of the train station in the middle of the night and fled the scene. Needless to say, 'the wall' is something I tease him about whenever he doubts my commentary or anxiety on a subject. It's used only jokingly, but that wall really left a dent in our minds.",

I was miserable a lot, and I wished I had an older sister, to be there for me.\n\nThere was this one time where my mother got one out of those books out of the library. It sounded kind of forced joviality when she said that it just looked interesting, she likes reading all kinds of books (true).\n\nI started to wonder if she’d given up a child. I knew she graduated high school a year later than her twin, because she’d had rheumatic fever twice, and she had been very ill. I wondered if perhaps one of those episodes was “romantic fever.”\n\nEventually I stopped dreaming of finding this hypothetical sibling. Moved out west. \n\nMy father died in 2006. In 2009, almost three years to the day of the stroke that killed him, my mother called me. She told me that my father “had a skeleton in the closet”. Before he had ever met my mother, my father had gotten a girl pregnant and then abandoned her after a fight with her father. He moved east, met and married my mother, they had me, they had my brother. My mother was the only person who knew this, and she had been sworn to secrecy.\n\nThat week, my half-sibling, a sister who had been given up for adoption at birth, had reached out to my mother on Facebook. So yes, I had an older sister. When I moved west, for a job, I ended up around 300 kms away from her. She is now my best friend. And thinks it’s hilarious to be described as a skeleton in a closet.",

I had reclined my seat and was just starting to doze off when I jolted awake to the sound of my husband (who was in the driver’s seat) yelling, followed by a thump-bumpy-bump, slam on the brakes, pull over. It took my husband a minute to actually be able to speak, he was so shaken. Turned out we had run over a whole family of wild pigs at 70-80mph- they had been crossing the road in a line. Our 4Runner was outfitted for offroading with (among other things) a lift kit and a solid steel front bumper - so thank God we went OVER the pigs instead of them coming up through the windshield. We went back to investigate and there were 4 dead in the road. It was insane.\n\nAnyhow, flash forward a couple of years and my sister and I are road tripping together. Similar scenario: two lane middle of nowhere highway, dusk, my sister reclines her seat to take a nap - I’m driving. I recall the story and tell it to my sister, explaining that it’s the reason why I have never been able to fall asleep in a car since - every time I start to doze off, in my head we’re running over the pigs again, and I jolt awake.\n\nShe dozes off.

So when I travel I always bring a small \"TSA compliant\" bottle of super strong lavender oil to mask bad smells. I'd never had to use it on a long trip before after years and years of flying for work and fun, although I came close a couple times due to being put near the rear of the plane by the bathrooms and someone droped a duece whose odor wasn't fully sucked out right away (gag.) \n\nBut finally it happened. I was on a public shuttle bus ride that takes 3 and 1/2 hours that goes direct from Recife to Porto De Galiñas a very nice, touristy beach. \n\nOn the way home, with an hour left to go on the ride, a smell began to overtake the bus that was so bad it literally smelled like someone shat their pants and died. \n\nAt first I thought someone farted but it quickly became eye-stingingly bad. \n\nTo make matters worse, the only two windows that could open were near the front of the bus, and they could only open halfway. \n\nThe bus was only half full, but within seconds nearly everyone was saying various things in Portuguese like \"Mother of God! What is this Smell?!\" \"Please open the windows!\" \"Bus driver, has someone died?!\"  \"Do we need to stop?\"\n\nRight when I started feeling the gag coming I remembered at the last minute that my paranoid self had packed my lavender oil at the bottom of my beach bag. I mean, I even brought it to the beach, that's how much of an over-packer I was.\n\nSo right when my partner said \"I'm going to ask the driver to stop I can't do this!\"\n\nI said \"Wait I have the solution!\" \n\nGot my lavender oil out, and we literally slathered it on ourselves and then passed it to all the passengers. \n\nIt was strong enough to kill off whatever the smell that was. We never found out the culprit of it. \n\nI'll never forget the looks on the passengers, who literally were saying \"Thank you so much! You have saved us! God bless you!\" It was something  I never in my life thought I would ever have a chance to use to save that many people from such a horrific smell.",

We all had fan coils in our units that weren't doing well. \n\nThere's a lot of details, but long story short we decided to nope out of there because we were tired of dealing with the issues. We knew there was a big special assessment coming down the pipes (they told us $30k for units our size), a flood from the year before had made our insurance premium (for the building) go up and made the deductible for water $300k, and I didn't want to wait around while the board hemmed and hawed about what to do about the fan coils that weren't functioning properly. \n\nSo we list at a low price to account for the problems and risk, knowing we'll lose ~$100k, and I'm panicked the whole time because all I can think is omg we have to sell now because a fan coil will fail, the building is going to flood, the insurance deductible is so high that the cost is going to be a nightmare. Simultaneously trying to calm myself down because the board wasn't concerned because they were working on a fix. \n\nWe sold really fast despite a slow market and all the building issues because the unit looked amazing, and we made it a quick close. The time between closing and possession was complete torture thinking of all the things that could go wrong - the assessment (which we disclosed was eventually coming to the seller) could get levied early and we'd be on the hook, the place could flood before the mech system got fixed, etc. One of the most stressful months of my life. \n\nOf course at the same time to some extent worrying we were making a huge mistake by selling because we were losing so much money and the suite was AMAZING (god I miss that kitchen and natural light😢)\n\nWe hand over the keys and move back into our tiny original condo. 2 months later a pipe bursts on the top floor of the building and the whole thing floods on one side, including our former suite. Last we heard, they were looking at special assessments of >$100k now to cover the floods plus all the original stuff that had to be done. \n\nNeedless to say, the whole experience completely reinforced my paranoid \"everything that can go wrong will\" thinking. 😅I'm just glad we went with our gut that things could always get worse. 😬\n\n(Edited to add the TLDR)",

She says it’s probably the road and I shouldn’t worry about it. I’m about to answer, when out of the corner of my eye, I see my front driver side wheel just…roll off my car. It takes off across the median and time slows to a crawl. I was driving a ‘92 Ford Explorer and as the front corner of the car dipped down, what was left of the axle dug into the pavement and there was a shower of sparks so big I couldn’t see out of my window. \n\nI stomped on the brakes, and the pedal went all the way to the floor, as my caliper had left with the wheel, and all I could do was try and yank the steering wheel as hard as I could to try and coast into the shoulder. Oh, and I was screeching into the walkie talkie while all this happened. \n\nRegardless, I don’t know why that scene popped in my head. And I don’t know if it helped me or not, except that the whole scenario was not nearly as surprising as it should have been.",

After the earthquake ended i took my backpack and got out and well it was good because i realized i forgot my mask at home and there was extra ones in my bag and also if i remember correctly after the earthquake and everything was settled my parents didnt have keys so that too.\n\n(sorry for the errors and long read)",

            "text": "Mine pertains to side effects of coronavirus vaccines. Before I got vaccinated, I did a very thorough research of potential side effects, especially those not officially mentioned on the list that you see when you sign up to get vaccinated. The list only mentions minor side effects like the usual headache, joint and muscle pain, fever and of course, the injection site pain/swelling aka \"covid arm\". What they don't mention are stuff like swollen lymph nodes, screwed up menstrual cycles, numbness/tingling sensations, nose bleeds, diarrhea vertigo, tinnitus, heart palpitations and other horrific things that people over at https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/new/ mention.\n\nThe first thing I did was make sure I was well hydrated days before the appointment. I'm a heavy drinker of water and juice, so no problem with that. Next, I read that moving and exercising the arm you're gonna get injected at can reduce the stinging pain a lot as it would allow the vaccine to spread more easily and be absorbed. I only ate mandarin fruits the night before the vaccination so that I can poop it out before the appointment so when the shot takes effect, I won't have anything to really vomit or poop out. As for the heart palpitations, I practiced deep breathing in order to force my heart to beat slower.\n\nI wasn't alone on the vaccination day. It's actually my family who signed me up (they have all of my documents) and they were underestimating the side effects. I kept warning them to be careful and not treat this like any kind of previous vaccines we've had because there are many negative side effect reports that weren't listed. I urged them to buy Tylenol because who knows how severe the vaccine will affect us.\n\nDay of the vaccine, we all got our shots. Just as I expected, within 30 minutes, my injection site down to my elbow started to get a numb/tingling feeling like when you sleep on your arm in a bad way. I immediately forced my arm to move around and massaged it. There was also the stinging pain of course, but I forced it anyway until the feeling subsided. I also had the headache which lasted for hours, but thankfully probably due to me drinking so much water and juice, the pain was just comparable to working in front of the computer for a whole day, something I'm very used to. I also had chills and fever, but I was prepared and it didn't really bother me that much because I've felt worse before. Up to this day, I still haven't opened up my bottle of Tylenol because the pain never got to the point that made me desperate for a pain reliever. I was only sick for 2 days. On the other hand, my family members who underestimated the side effects ended up taking Tylenol because they couldn't bear the pain. Imagine if I didn't tell them to buy Tylenol, they probably would have sent me out to buy it for them.\n\nIt's always better to overprepare for something than be caught helpless later on.",

One day the feeling became so intense that I went to our union about the situation. The harassment, false promises, blatant sexism (female in tech), threats, sabotage, union busting, etc. As I'm telling the union rep my concerns management sends them an email stating that they (management) wants them (union) to fire me. The rep is just astounded and states \"We're the union, we don't fire people. Who are these people?!\". Well all that overthinking meant I had oodles of evidence. Even though they disabled my work email the emails were still on my devices and I screenshot them and the chats as well. Boy oh boy, they weren't happy about that. Then they tried to falsify my dismissal to unemployment. The unemployment rep was a turd, willing to ignore everything I said and I threw it in her face \"I have evidence that they are lying. Do you?\" The union stepped in with assistance from my doctor and neurologist to show how management had been lying. This is on top of the 6 *MONTHS* it took to get a correct record of employment. They actually sent me three incorrect records before unemployment just took my word for the hours and pay for the last year. I've never heard of that happening. But all that overthinking had me ready for their bullshit. \n\n\n\n\nFunny bit of irony bonus: They refused to let me work from home as punishment for standing up for myself. 6 months later Covid hit and they aren't allowed to work from the office.",

The road trip was not my idea - I went because if I hadn't, my mother was going to try to do it by her damn self.  \n\n\nTo make a trip like that, at her age at the time, Grandma had to get cleared by her doctor. I went with her to the appointment. Through the whole thing, I kept waiting for the doc to bring up what to do in case of a leak.  \nSee, we were not taking the south route around the Rockies - we were going to be crossing the Continental Divide.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the term, the Continental Divide is basically the spine of the US. The elevation we were starting from in Kansas was 288 feet. The highest point of the route we were taking was about 8500 feet. That's a hell of a difference in air pressure.  \n\n\nOxygen cylinders are pressurized. External air pressure matters.  \n\n\nThe doc said nothing, none of my aunts or my uncle seemed to think it was a concern, so I figured maybe I was making a mountain out of a molehill in my own head. I still made a plan for what to do if the seals failed or leaked, so I could give myself permission to stop thinking about it.  \n\n\nWhich of course they did, because otherwise this story wouldn't be here! We were at about 7000 feet (I think, this was years ago) when we discovered that the spare oxygen bottle was totally empty and the one Grandma was using was losing pressure way faster than it should be. It was middle-of-nowhere Wyoming. We had no idea where the nearest hospital was, and no cell reception.  \n\n\nMy mom panicked. I did not.  \n\n\nGrandma's oxygen cylinders came with a little concentrator-recharger machine - and by \"little\", I mean \"the size of a suitcase and as loud as an HVAC system\". It had to be plugged into a wall socket to work. The in-case-of plan was to put in at the nearest viable location to recharge the bottles (if possible), monitor Grandma, and be easy for emergency services to find if she took a turn for the unstable or if the seals on the bottles turned out to be blown.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause I'd bothered to plan for this, I'd been keeping track of where the nearest/next place that fit the bill was, and we ended up backtracking to the last truck stop we'd seen since it was much closer than the next location we'd seen signs for.\n\nBecause *I* didn't panic, *Grandma* didn't panic, and her staying calm helped keep the situation from escalating (because wow, my mom *really* panicked).   \n\n\nThe rest of that trip was a huge frigging headache, but we made it without having to take Grandma to a hospital.

About 2 months before the wedding, myself and a couple other work friends were told by the groom that we were going to be groomsmen due to a couple of his buddies not being able to get passports in time to come to the wedding (family and friends from Canada). We were obviously surprised but excited nonetheless and went about the usual tasks of getting the matching suits and everything. We got to the rehearsal and find out that the best man can’t make the wedding (due to the passport issue) so one of the other groomsmen was bumped up to best man and we went about the rehearsal and everything. Being the overthinker that I am, I was scoping out this recently appointed best man and realized he was a pretty quiet, awkward guy. That night and the day of the wedding I thought about what the best man speech would look like and came up with a simple one on the off chance something crazy happened (in my mind something crazy is the best man getting hit by a car). Come the reception after the wedding and the DJ comes over to the table of groomsmen and says “we need one of you to give a speech in 60 seconds.” The table consisted of only a couple of us and the other groomsmen made a mad dash for the bathroom like the courageous individuals they were. So within 60 seconds I was on the stage in front of a few hundred wedding attendees giving a best man speech that I had half prepared for ahead of time. Luckily it turned out well and I thank my overthinking for making my buddy’s wedding go off without a hitch (pun intended)",

This is in Mindanao where The Philippines regularly clash with Communist rebels, but General Santos City is heavily secured by the Military so it’s pretty safe. Normally I like to travel 1 day before the rest of my team so that I can do some sight seeing and my day was going great so far! For dinner I went to a very tourist centric area where they grill up a lot of meat and serve a lot of seafood, the place was called Tiongson Arcade; this is where my split second decision saved my life.\n\nI find the busiest restaurant in the area, order, sit down and enjoy my meal. People were giving me odd looks because of how amused I was by the quality of the food and the prices! I ordered enough seafood and bbq for 3 people and it all cost me less than 10 USD. Now I’m very much into IG and I was whipping my gear out to take nice photos of the food when I inevitably caught the eye of some bad people.\n\nThe restaurant had communal tables, kind of like a school cafeteria with long tables and benches. As I was eating, seven men who also had food served decided to sit near me. I had a bad feeling creep up when I noticed their stares towards me and my stuff! I initially brushed it off as me being an overthinker.\n\nTheir food arrives and they start eating with their bare hands (this is important to the story), which is normal for a lot of asians. I finish my meal and decide to go back to the hotel, as I stood up I noticed one of the several men flick his finger to signal one of his comrades opposite hinself, to which a man suddenly shoots straight up! My suspicions were confirmed and the fear kickstarted the adrenaline and my brain was computing 1000X times faster than normal! So fast I went on autopilot and I thought of a plan to shake the guy following me.\n\nSo I see an area that had sinks where guests could wash their hands after eating, I make my way there and behind me the man from earlier followed. His hands literally had rice and sauce dripping from it and this only cemented my suspicions of his bad motives because he was coming to an area to wash his hands in the middle of a meal. I turn on the tap and I feel the guy stand behind me, I immediately move to the side and tell him he can wash his hands first! This caught him offguard as he did wash hands in a very confused manner, I then bolt it towards the lobby and ultimately the exit, I make it outside when I decide to turn around and look! Lo and behold the man comes rushing after me! We make brief eye contact and in an attempt to hide his intentions, he grabs the nearest waitress to ask a question. In that split second I hid behind a few parked cars, luckily this was by the road so I found a Tricycle (think tuktuk but it’s a Motorcycle with a sidecar for passengers) and hopped right in. I yelled to the driver my Hotel and told him I’d pay 5x more than the usual rate if he got me there quickly, he was ecstatic and took off. We passed by the front of the restaurant and I see my stalker, standing by the road, scratching his head wondering where the fuck I was and how did I get away so quickly.\n\nI got back to the hotel and I inform the concierge. Some military assets (think spies for the military) were called and they asked what happened. After telling my story, they then inform me that this was a group from a neighboring town who abduct tourists. They were a part of the communist rebels who would kidnap tourists and ransom them off for millions of Pesos.\n\nScary experience but at least I have a cool story!\n\nTl;dr I was almost kidnapped in the Philippines but got away safely because I overhink every situation and generally distrust strangers.",

            "text": "I always wondered how I would react if i was fired by a friend. Well it happened. Years ago, I worked with a guy in sales. We’re gonna call him “Ted”. Ted and I bonded over the years alongside the other crew members. We were literally like family. Ted is an ambitious guy and we all knew he was interested in management. Well over the years he moved up in the company and eventually became our store manager. Now, Ted wasn’t quite the straight and narrow salesman. He did questionable things but hey it’s sales. I was more of a straight arrow for the most part. Well, I was struggling with a specific sales metric and that was unacceptable to him. Ted wanted sales by any means necessary whether it’s legit or not. It’s a numbers game. I tried everything in my power to increase sales for that metric but to no avail. People just wasn’t interested. What i discovered later was that some of the most successful salesmen was using fraudulent tactics to get them. I wasn’t onboard with that. So long story short, he systematically set me up to be fired by writing me up for not following sales process and mundane things like 2-3 minutes late from lunch etc. To be fair, I understand his responsible for store numbers, i get it. It’s high pressure sales but don’t have me terminated for doing things the right way but others do it fraudulently. \n\nEventually i was fired. Some of my coworkers was shocked because I’ve been with the company for so long and i was usually one of the top salesmen. One of my coworkers even cried. Ted walked me out the door and couldn’t even look me in the face. Some coworkers even told me he joked about it at a meeting. Ted is still with the company unfortunately. Sometimes, bad things happen to good ppl.\n\nTLDR; Fired by former friend for not doing fraudulent sales. He was pretty normal guy when we both sold together but when he became a manager he revealed his true narcissistic, sociopathic nature.",

            "text": "I traveled to Venice with my cousins in 2018. The last day of our trip we had a disagreement on how to spend the morning: our flight back home would depart at 7 pm, I guessed we should arrive at the airport three hours prior given it was a new, unfamiliar airport, and the later you arrive the longer the queues you might encounter, increasing the chance to miss your flight. Besides, we had to commute to get there: we had to take a bus that would take an hour on the road, and a ferry from the place we rented to the bus station that would take about 40 min to get there, so all things considered I though we should head out at noon, but my cousins said I was exaggerating and we would have plenty of room if we spent the morning shopping and headed out at 3:30 . And yes, sure... if everything goes right, but judging by the amount of commutes in unfamiliar territory at carnival season I doubted that was likely. Now, if we miss the flight, we would end up paying circa $2000 per person for a new ticket back home and for accommodation... which meant *I* would end up paying $6000 for all of us since cousin 1 could barely afford to come and cousin 2 had her wallet stolen at day 2... which on itself would be lost money because I could not foresee an scenario where they would pay me back with a smile, if at all. So I lied and said we actually had to leave at noon since the Airbnb was rented already for that afternoon and, since shopping carrying around luggage in carnival season was exhausting, they dropped the idea and we headed straight to the airport. And just like I foresaw, things went wrong: we bought ferry tickets for the bus station but waited in the wrong spot, waited circa half an hour just for the ferry to deny us boarding saying they were a different company, by the time we arrived to the actual spot the ferry had already left and we had to wait for the next one. This delay caused for us to miss the bus and had to wait for the next one. We barely made it to the airport, just a minute before they closed baggage check.",

            "text": "Graduate program project group. The exact details I'll leave out since there seem to be few enough programs that makes identifying personal info really easy.\n\nBasically I was tasked as a team lead to ensure the group kept itself \"to task\". The task was self-defined after the first semester, so we collectively decided as a team of 7 to go overkill and have a functional prototype to present to the program directors. \n\nNow that the context is out of the way, i see we have 5 weeks left until all our efforts are due for presentation and think to myself: \"Here's what's going to happen. We are going to try and do everything last minute because were young 20-somethings. I'm going to emphasize a general schedule for the 3rd week so we can avoid doing it all last minute. Then I'll assess the man-hours expected to complete each task.\" Clearly this is logical for a project schedule... Except I went down the rabbit hole and tacked on man-hours for critical problems in each task. So I tallied something on the order of 170 man-hours + 400 for critical errors on all tasks. I had an inherently bad feeling that a bunch of 20-somethings were going to cram the hardest work into the last week after all. This wasn't the real problem however. The real problem was all the critical hurdles popping up in the final week, throwing an extra 400 man-hours on the table. I reasoned this rabbit hole of digging because I'm extremely distrustful of manufacturers that have a spec sheet saying, \"works with this line of code we put on github\".\n\n3 weeks later (week 3): everything went exactly as planned. Everyone ignored my input to divide tasks into a few major sub groups earlier. I had to force the split into cross-functional subgroups in the team. Arguably better than my original suggestion. I then post my estimation of man-hours to explain that we can get everything done without any miracles.\n\n(Week 4): more unexpected events show up total addition of about 100 man-hours. People complain about man-hours being too complicated (even though they didn't need to understand it themselves for their own tasks and didn't provide a solution to the non-existent problem). Work continues with cross functional teams. A little external drama happens here and there.\n\n(Week 5): everything is working fine except one feature of the prototype build. This feature failure added another 30-70 man-hours 2 days before our deadline. Man-hours were used to justify cutting this feature and redistributing work for compiling work into a file and developing respective parts of a presentation. Overall, we basically saved 2 hours of discussion with 7 people (14 man-hours) by me overthinking for 2 hours alone to develop criteria to cut project activities based on man-hour requirements. We ended with essentially meeting over 90% of our ambitious design goals by only working two 8 hour long days with the full team. That week we put in nearly of 130 man-hours into the project.\n\n\nYou might be thinking that I expected the procrastination to be the major issue. You're not wrong, I genuinely was expecting that and it did in fact happen. It's just that procrastination is expected. What was \"unlikely\" is that we expected all of our electronics parts to work more or less out of the box. One of them didn't, and we couldn't figure out why. \"The spec sheet said this, but it isn't working that way.\" \n\nThat exact scenario was preplanned to be an automatic \"cut feature\" criteria 5 weeks prior because I am inherently distrustful of many manufacturers. It just also happened to coincide with procrastination and a short argument that died the instant I pulled up my rabbit hole estimates. \n\nSeems like overthinking to me in hindsight, but I'm also far less experienced just by my age so maybe this is a normal high-likelihood problem.",

And she wanted it to go further. But i was nervous. \n\nI finally got here and it's been almost 3 months. She has not hung out with me once. And it really sucks. She ignored me for so long. I told her to talk to me but it would always be through message. And i suck at expressing feeling through message. I told her let me talk to you. Work things out. \n\nWe finally after a month talked through message. I sent her a big message with no ill intent. Nothing bad. Just asking that i know we haven't hung out a lot. I want to get to know her better because we only hungout for like a week together. And she i guess thought i wanted to rush things. \n\nI didn't want to force her to do that but was willing if she wanted to. She told me she didn't think we clicked. And i was like yeah we only hungout a few times. But since i expected this outcome i wasn't mad or sad. I was prepared to come to texas knowing that things wern't 100 percent certain. And that was good on my part.\n\nBut the way i knew was because it was a pattern of what happend with me and her years ago. We talked a lot years ago. Then slowly she ignored me. I asked why she wouldn't say. Then finally i noticed she kept playing games with this guy in ranked rainbow. And overwatch. She would never let me join. Same thing happened now. All she wanted to do was play league with another one of our male friends. And play ranked duos. We had a whole 5 man squad. But she only played with the other male friend. \n\nSo i was already having bad feelings. I talked to the other male friend and he said oh i wouldn't do that to you. And that he was my best friend. And well here i am almost 3 months later. Just sad a little but never cried because i was prepared. It was the exact same pattern from years ago. I've learned that patterns happen a lot. \n\nAs this was happening i wrote a whole google doc and had discord messages sent with dates as predictions for what would happen in the future. All my predictions came true. And that sucked. I'm near the dallas area and have been looking for a job here. But the stipulation with my family was that i get 3 months to stay with them for free as long as i was looking for and job and place. I barely just had 2 interviews last week. And 1 deems like i might get the job. But i'm waiting to figure out the pay. \n\nBecause if the pay isn't enough then i'm just gonna go back home. To my actual best friends. We have 5 total in out friend group 4 of us live near eachother. And the feae friend in texas. At the moment only 2 of my friends hangout all the time. And i've learned they're my real best friends. Not rhe orher guy and the female. Sucks but i was prepared to lose. Sucks though my family here will miss me. But i think i'd rather hangout with my real best friends then to be alone in texas with no friends. So i'm most likely going back home.",

On that day about 25 kids (18 years old Max) on spring break boarded the boat with us.  Most of them inebriated already.  While underway these kids continued to suck down booze for the 30 minute cruise to the spot we would do our snorkeling adventure. I KNEW something bad was going to happen. The young group of smashed kids were drunk and just stayed on the boat. My wife and I put on our gear and slipped into the beautiful water of the cove with some others.  I felt preoccupied with the feeling that something bad was going to happen.\n\nI caught a glimpse of a kid on the top deck of the boat, no life vest. He leaps from a height of say 20-30 feet and while attempting to do a flip he smash’s his he’d on the metal railing of the main deck before disappearing into the water.  I knew he had to be unconscious and I made my way over to his splash. The water was crystal clear, and he was sinking like a stone. I took off my life vest and went down to get him.  A member of the boat crew had jumped in as well, and we got him on board.  The kid was semi-conscious by then and had a bloody gash on his head.  As we made our way back to the marina I felt my anxiety dissipate.  We spotted the kid and his friends a couple days later.  Dude didn’t have any memory of the event.

It's never really come up, though one dog put in a valiant attempt when we came home and he had a cassette tape dragging behind him and the tape part in his gullet. I had just helped clean that damn room and know for a fact the only thing at his level was some books on a bookshelf, office furniture, etc. It must have been like, really high up and fell off somehow. Anyways...\n\nWe recently got a new puppy. We did our best for four months to try and adopt from a shelter, but this was near the beginning of the pandemic and (fortunately for the animals) the shelters in a huge area around us were all empty, continuously. Which is great for the animals, I'd rather every single one be adopted than even one sitting in a cage, wondering why they're there. So eventually, we found a guy who had just bred a litter of puppies. And no, this wasn't a puppy mill. We made damn sure to do our research. And it had been a few years since the other litter so she wasn't being constantly farmed for puppies to sell.\n\nWe strongly believed that our previous dog had extended the length and quality of our older dog by providing companionship and exercise. They played for hours a day and the extra exercise and companionship had to do him some good. He would've kept going strong at 12 years old if during a checkup, they hadn't missed a super early sign of cancer. I don't fault the vet. When reading about it to help cope, the symptom he had was innocuous and easily missed. Before all that, he had nearly perfect health exams.\n\nWhen we got our puppy, she was very interested in chewing on sticks. Many times I had to follow her asking her what she had in her mouth and she'd trot away, trying to hide that she had a stick. Chewing sticks was a no-no because they can fragment and choke the dog. She liked her fake, toy stick and her teething rings quick a bit, but sticks just had some allure to them.\n\nOne day about two months ago, I got up in the early afternoon. (I lost my job because of COVID. I'm not a NEET, I'm taking online courses for a possible career in the trades). As I was greeting the dogs, I noticed that the younger one had a piece of stick in her mouth and it was in a really weird position. It was stuck between two teeth near the back of her mouth and it was lodged so it ran the width of her mouth.\n\nHope this gives a better description: T = tooth\n        T--roof of mouth--T\n\nThen I asked that damned question, \"What have you got in your mouth?\" and that when the fucker dislodged itself and then re-lodged itself in her throat. I had thought about this scenario ever since I was pretty young and it just now happened. She coughed and hacked a couple times and it scared my mother and the other dog. I immediately got a hold of her, gently rolled her onto her back (can't do that too fast or it can cause the object to slip further down their throat), holding her head flat and her mouth open, I began doing the sweep of the throat with my finger. The one where you make your finger into a little hook. Surprisingly, being a scared puppy, she did not fight me and I was able to feel the stick and then get my middle finger down there and slide the stick out carefully. Didn't want to hurt her throat or cause any pain that might make her jump and me lose hold of the stick.\n\nIt was only a couple seconds but it felt a bit longer, you know the feeling when there's a sudden problem and you just start thinking a lot faster? Basically that. I'd always been afraid I'd be grossed out by having to look and feel around inside her throat, but very thankfully, I didn't even think about it.\n\nAfter a couple seconds, she crawled onto my lap and our older dog came over to check on her, he was sniffing and rubbing her muzzle with his own and I just petted her for a little bit. And then five minutes later, she either forgot what had happened or didn't care because they both raced to the back yard to play frisbee. After that, I was very thorough in de-stickifying the back yard. We have the second largest oak tree in the county in our front yard and it's canopy is huuuuuuuge, so that sucker is always dropping sticks. The dog wood in the back isn't nearly so bad.\n\nPlease excuse any major errors in formatting or spelling, I wrote this on my phone.",

No big deal normally, but if he didn't show up to the final event, we wouldn't be able to perform. Going off this gut instinct of mine, I convinced my brother to ride along with me to the final event. (Side note: brother was also a percussion student, just wasn't playing in this piece). We get there, and sure enough, Mr. Flake is a no show. Everyone panics, until my brother offers his assistance. He did wonderfully, and my crush was very appreciative. Gave my brother a hug, she was so grateful. \n\nNever have I been so glad to be an overthinker. Lol",

Just as that thought almost completely exits my brain, I make sure to tell myself it's an absurd thought and more than likely a situation I'll never be in. A second or two later (the timing is sorta hazy because it happened so quick and also felt like an eternity simultaneously) I look to my left down the street a ways and notice a black sporty sorta car coming and they didn't seem to be in any hurry to slow down. So a few seconds later again, the car makes it's way towards the intersection a bit more and I start to realize that if they're stopping at all they're gonna have to slam the brakes hard and I may want to backup a bit in case they end up swerving to avoid the guy crossing the road. Right then it clicks in my head again there's a guy crossing the street and I actually audibly said out loud to my date \"Holy shit they're not slowing down much. Wouldn't it suck if they drill this dude?\" . Just as I finish the sentence I looked to my left again and see the car and where the guy is at and I realized there's no longer an if in this situation, they're actually going to hit this poor bastard.\n\nSo just like I expected they don't slow down or swerve, and the guy doesn't notice them and move (because he has no reason to expect a car to come through the intersection), and then bam! They totally hit the guy and I shit you not he was literally knocked out of his shoes just like in a cartoon. Even worse, after they hit the guy they just kept going and didn't even stop.\n\nBecause I'd been thinking about it a bit, I  immediately pull my car into the intersection to shield him from oncoming traffic as the light is now green and he's just laying there on the ground. I get out expecting to see some gnarly shit, and miraculously this guy's conscious and I can't believe it but I don't even see a drop of blood on him. The guy starts talking and tries to sit up and I'm like \"hey hey hey stop it man! You don't know if anything is broken. You just got hit by a car but you're not bleeding and we've called you an ambulance already\". So luckily he's calm and collected and follows my instructions and doesn't try moving, so I start just checking out what I can and ask if he feels any pain in any specific parts of his body and he doesn't, so I immediately worry that something is broken and I start checking and tell him to wiggle the fingers on his left hand, then his right and he has no trouble. So then I tell him okay don't move your legs but I want you to try wiggling your left toes and then your right toes, and luckily he can so I tell him that he's doing great so far. At this point he says he's okay and he can situp and I again tell him no don't do that, it's good he can move his extremities but that doesn't mean there's nothing wrong or nothing that could go wrong, and I tell him he's gotta lay still and not move anything until the ambulance gets there.\n\nA minute or two goes by and they show up and get the stretcher and do the whole thing where they roll you on your side and then onto the stretcher and then pick it up. They ask me a couple questions about what's happened and if he's moved, so I tell them no I wouldn't let him do anything besides trying to wiggle his extremities, just to make sure there wasn't any obvious bad break or paralysis, and the dude tells me thanks and good job and before they take off to the hospital I slip him my card to call if they have any other questions.\n\nA few hours go by and I get a call from the EMT letting me know the guys fine and doing okay, but he had a broken back and if we weren't there to block traffic and make sure he didn't stand up or do anything, he would have likely severed one of his nerves and been paralyzed from the waste down.\n\nI still hate that I over think everything though.",

There were a lot of rules and regulations that I wanted to follow fairly and to the letter, as this hearing would either end a student's academic career or result in someone entering a medical profession after having already been proven to have plagiarized coursework submissions twice and been accused of doing it a third time. It was extremely important to me and to everyone involved that this work be done to a very high standard.\n\nI spent days with those regulations, reviewing every detail from burden of proof to procedural regulations to what people could bring into the hearing. One of the things a student could choose to bring was a lawyer, so I talked myself through what to do in all sorts of cases: angry / disruptive student, intimidating lawyer, missing paperwork. I went into the hearing laughing a little at myself for wildly overpreparing for what would probably be very simple.\n\nShe brought a lawyer. A vocal, disruptive lawyer who imagined he was there to grandstand to a jury and who raised objections at every turn. Fortunately, I knew from the regulations that he wasn't allowed to present arguments, only to advise his client - and, thank goodness, I had literally talked myself through what to say if that happened, so I was able to be calm, firm, and consistent through repeated outbursts on his part. \n\nThe institution had their own lawyer in attendance as well. She said nothing throughout the proceedings, but as we were all leaving the room, she told me quietly that she was impressed with how well I ran it. Man, did that feel good.",

Already had plans for if it was through the drive thru then this. If by lobby this, and if they got behind counter, this. I had all the steps, knew the camera angles to catch them in and had clean surfaces for them to touch for prints. They were caught within 12 hours. Used the same for the next one as well, took a bit longer to catch them. Guns in face are not a fun thing at 17-20 years old.\n\nMall shootings were just because no one in the company or our mall had ever really thought of it. I had seen about several over the years on the news and decided, eh may as well look into safety on this and what people wish they did or did do and it saved lives. It was my first time working in a mall so, again, my active brain. Ta da. Didn't have to use it until year 3 of working at that place. Then again twice in year 4 within a month span. Saved my customers and some bystanders. It went so well because I prepared my team like this too. I am crazy calm when things fall apart and I cannot explain that at all. Inside I am freaking out. But that calm and research and thinking things through saved people on more than one occasion and my store (my store manager and mainly myself, because she delegated it to me mostly for my actions and research I had done before to get them to this point) ended up writing the policy for our active shooter and bomb threat scenarios. They used about 90% of my stuff in the final policy and video layout that went company wide (international company). Sadly, no raise or bonus or whatever from that but we have been told that since it was implemented in 2018 our policy has been used 30 times and saved over 200 people in different events. So that's good at least. My little mark on the world without a name on it.

I didn't know anyone in my building, which suddenly changed when I picked up my mail at the same time as this girl living there. I had seen her around on my floor and knew she lived a few doors down, but had never talked to her. In emptying our mailboxes, we get to talking and turns out, we were planning on ordering pizza from the same place later that night. \"Well,\" goes ultra-smooth me, \"why don't you come over to my room and we can order together?\"\n\nGirl comes over, we put on a movie, talk a bit, then order pizza. I get a peperoni pizza, she gets a pesto pizza. Great. Pizza arrives, we're having a bottle of wine, super fun. Until it's not.\n\nShe stops mid-sentence, grabs her throat, falls off my bed sideways onto the floors and starts having these weird convulsions for a second before going limp. I don't know HOW exactly I remained as level-headed as I was, but my reasoning was, \"bad stuff in, bad stuff must come out\". I carried her to the toilet, made her throw up. I then felt she was *hot*, like a fever, so I put some cold water on her from the shower while I dialled my equivalent of 911.\n\nI explained calmly that I had a girl over who I thought was having an allergic reaction. \"You *think* she 's allergic?\" Yes, I don't actually know because I don't know the girl and she never mentioned. \"What's her name?\" No idea, actually. I could've sworn I knew her first name an hour ago, but I'm blanking. They also asked \"I have to ask, is this a prank? You're being awfully calm. If it is, tell me before I dispatch an ambulance and you won't be in trouble.\"\n\nParamedics get in, tell me I did well getting the pizza back out of her body. They need to give her fluids. I'm starting to realise they're ready to set her up *on my bed*, so I quickly interject that she lives a few doors down. I get my landlord / landlady, which are a weird couple that live downstairs on the premises and get in everyone's business. They have a key to let us in, but they *also* stay, smack dab in the way of the paramedics. So I help out, keep the landlady out of their business while answering their questions and holding up a fluid bag, until they get her stable enough to transport her to the ER.\n\nI was asked if I wanted to ride along but I said \"no, I think I need to rest for a bit\". We had called her parents already so they were on the way, she wasn't going to wake up alone. I went back to my room, cleaned up after us, didn't finish the movie, threw the pizza out.\n\nTwo days later, I get a knock on my door. I open it, and there she is, beaming at me. \"I just got back from the hospital and was told by the doctors that you saved my life.\" Heh, you're welcome. I still don't know how I managed to stay that calm. I was considering asking her back in to finish that movie, but then she hit me with this: \"*What did you do with that pizza? Are there any leftovers?\"* I stare at her for a minute. \"You... realise you almost died from eating that pizza, right?\" She then went on to explain that every time she gets a sandwich or a salad with pesto in it, she gets this weird tingling feeling in her mouth and she thought that was just *the flavour* and she really liked it. This must have been something else, because she never had this kind of reaction to anything before. Okay then. I told her I threw it out and had to go continue my homework. I never saw her again.\n\n**TL;DR** I invited a girl I don't know to eat pizza with me. She has an allergic reaction, nearly dies, and then asks for leftovers so she can die a little more.",

I was a girl scout so \"be prepared\" is a life motto and I've had a few really bad times in my life where just getting food has been hard, so I now ensure I always have plenty of shelf stable food on hand just in case. I'm also from SoCal, where fire/earthquake/flooding are not unknown so I like to have emergency supplies.\n\n I moved to Australia about a year before covid and began slowly building up my new food storage and emergency supplies (had to donate all my other stuff). During that time we had a situation where the roads were closed out of Western Australia and there were shortages of some types of foods - fire on one road, cyclone flooding the other, yes there are only really 2 main roads out, it's a remote state with a lot of wilderness, like hot Alaska.\n\nSince I don't drive here yet (opposite side of the road hurts my brain), I became familiar with e-commerce and online shopping here in Australia and began to realize that a lot of stuff was dependent on imports and that a lot of websites were not that great, so I began stepping up my \"prepping\" just in case - that experience with the roads showed me that we have somewhat fragile supply lines in Perth - and rebuilt my emergency kit a bit more quickly. When I saw the news in China while the fires were going on, I bought a bit more than usual during my grocery pickup. The staff even teased me a ton about preparing for the end of the world (most people here seem to shop on a as-needed basis, so this was me getting like 2 bags of rice and a dozen cans of stuff). \n\nWell, when covid hit there was a massive run on the stores - every store, even the online ones. Panic buying was unknown here which made it even more of a frenzy. The grocery stores TURNED OFF their online ordering because their systems couldn't handle the demand, while other stores had websites that took forever to load and lost orders because they were overloaded, so the only way to get food (and many other supplies) was to go in person...and even that didn't mean places would be in stock. Stuff like canned cat food, masks, antibacterial wipes, bleach, batteries, exercise equipment, just a huge range of everything, were just out of stock for weeks or longer.\n\nBecause of our supplies (and the garden I started a few months beforehand), we were able to almost completely avoid stores for nearly 3 months until online ordering came back online and stocks replenished, which we were very grateful for as I'm immunocompromised.\n\nI also conviced my husband to upgrade our ute to a nice, affordable little used 4x4 since the Ute was getting old and unreliable and we wanted to road trip. Once lockdown lifted, people in WA were basically stuck here so everyone bought 4x4s and caravans and the prices went up a TON, so we're grateful for me making that call!",

One day we got lost on a trail (not a big deal, we just misread the signs and took the longer route) and instead of going for 2 hours or so, we walked for about 5...uphill... and when people finished their small bottles of water and started greeting hungry, you'd start hearing from left and right \"Hey, did you pack an extra sandwich I could have?\" \"I know you've been packing snacks, care to share some with me?\" \"May I have a sip of water?\" and so on and so forth.

I was also going on a study trip to France that summer because I kicked ass in French class...and my mom paid for it.\n\n70% of the rest of the kids on the trip were older high school girls.

Being a scrawny kid , I would fantasize situations where my cleverness would win the day.  \n\nSo I imagined many heroic scenarios, but one was where some young French males would surround me and several of these young women, cat-calling and attempting to seduce the innocent lasses.  I, being clever, would confuse them by telling these rapscallions ( in French,  of course) that we were from Norway, and somehow that would allow the girls to get away.  I wasn't a detailed planner.\n\nWell, we were studying in a coastal town.  One day a navy ship came in, and as I was walking the seafront with four if these young women, we were suddenly surrounded by about 8 horny French sailors, who were cat calling and attempting to seduce.  \n\nQuickly, I sprung into action .  First, I got the sailors' attention.  Then I announced  ( in French,  naturally) that we were here from Norway.  Well, the sailors were completely stumped at how to respond to such an announcement. They began to pepper me with questions.  I pretended (well, not really pretended) that I didn't speak French very well. \n\nAnd somehow during all that, the girls managed to get away.  It fucking worked. They thought I was brave.",

Everyone knew about us,our friends ,more or less our families. Atleast that's what she told me. Only problem was she was in another department and had one year less than to graduate. So she had to move back to her hometown,didn't want a long term relationship,so we never officially declared we were in a relationship. It went on for about a year, never had anything more than just a hug,never felt the need to. That mutual thing was happiest I ever was ,and it was the worst time of my life outside of that. I was still happy. Before leaving she asked for my hoodie as a keepsake. She gave me a tee that I loved on her. I was so in love with her, I proposed that we continue and make a long distance thing, to I graduate and then I'll come work wherever she will be then. I even offered her it to be an open relationship , just in case she thought she can't do it without physical presence. I was ready for any condition. I just wanted her.\n\nRight before leaving she went on a trip to nearby town with some of her childhood friends who had come to help her move back. After a couple of days of ignoring me, she called me and said that her friends were asking about me and why was I calling her so much. That she realised I'm not get boyfriend so I shouldn't be calling her like that. Then next day she tells me casually she made out with a guy in the hotel room. I have had very rough time till then in college. I had been depressed, failed, humiliated and everything. That was when i cried for the first time in years. She used to say she loved me. And then she flipped on me like that. Call me crazy but it didn't sit well with me, to say the least.\n\nSometimes I think she did it to help me get over her. Who knows? It's been 7-8 years. I never dated again. Probably never will. So I am prepared to never get married.\n\nSorry for the long comment.",

One of the optional courses was a cultural anthropology class. I get there on the first day and the dude teaching it just gives me a vaguely icky vibe but I can't place why. He seemed  like just another annoyed adjunct who looked like he could have been an extra on the office, but I'm paranoid so I started a voice recorder app on my phone in secret before every lecture (I live in a one party consent state, I've looked it up for other incidents before.) About halfway through the semester he starts dipping into some kinda racist stuff, not anything super explicit but enough I was a little more uncomfortable than I had been. A lecture later, he mentioned being a reformed racist/white supremacist and that he was \"attempting not to think that way anymore.\" Here's the thing, good on him for making the attempt to change, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna trust him implicitly. People can and do change for the better, and it's definitely possible to change how you think. However, he always gave off the vibe that he was half assing it, and that he was making this change due to a social pressure and not nessisarily a true change of heart. he'd said enough stuff by that point that another girl in my class was getting uncomfortable and when I mentioned my recordings she said she felt a little safer (she was native and concerned that he might flunk her on skin color alone. She was my study buddy and I knew she was working her ass off like the rest of us, so we kept an eye on her grades in comparison to my own.) To his credit, he didnt fail anyone on skin color. The class itself was great and we went over a lot of interesting niche subjects. but my icky feeling was somewhat correct. I never had to send my recordings to anyone, he never said anything that was outright horrible.\n I hope he really wanted to change, living with hate in your heart isn't a way to live. If he can stay out of that headspace, he'll stay a pretty decent professor.",

I talked to my husband about making bug out bags for ourselves and our 2 cats, as well as an evacuation plan and a plan to get the cats into the carriers as fast as possible in case of an unrelated emergency. \n\nI was told I was overreacting and while the state can have severe hurricanes, we aren't close enough to the coast for it to be much of an issue ( hint- he was wrong). At my insistence, bought 4 backpacks and any kind of emergency supplies I thought we would need to last 3 days. I got them all packed, including the cats bags with their food, water bottles, toys, disposable litter pans with litter inside, they whole works and shoved everything into the hall closest. I practiced grabbing the cats and getting them into carriers as fast ( and safely) as I could and practiced getting everything out of the apartment and into the car efficiently and quickly. \n\nThe following spring we were woken up by the building fire alarms going off and all my planning payed off. My husband grabbed the bug out bags and I got the cats in the carriers  (they sleep on the bed with us and didn't run at the fire alarm. I think we got lucky) and we had everything in the car in under 5 minutes. We were half dressed, but that hardly mattered to me at the time. We were out before anyone had gotten out of their apartments yet, so with everything safe in the car, we started banging on doors yelling about the fire. I ended up helping a woman carry one of her kids out and my husband got a guys 2 dogs leashed and out for him.   \n\n\nIt turns out a woman on the 3rd floor burned cookies and it was only a small fire that was contained to her stove.

If someone catches me off guard I freeze I can’t speak until I’ve been given enough time to think about my words. \n\nUsually I think about all the worst case scenarios and end up figuring out exactly what not to say. Like this time at work I got in trouble for ignoring my bosses requests for something I didn’t want to do. I knew I was well within my rights to not do x and I also knew my boss didn’t care about my rights. I spent the entire time she reprimanded me thinking of all the awful things I could say and when it came time to talk I said the one thing she didn’t expect. “Well if it’s really that bad that I didn’t do x maybe the store manager should know about it.” She smirked like you dumb fuck you just got yourself fired. So she setup a meeting with the store manager later that day. \n\nWhile I waited I thought of all the ways I could fuck this up. Ultimately I went into that meeting and laid it down in the most eloquent way that I knew the employee handbook from front to back and that my boss was trying to bully me into doing x to look good. \n\nWithin a few weeks my boss was demoted to manage a much smaller department and I was  basically in my own league. Managers were afraid to ask anything more from me beside basic duties and as long as customers were happy. \n\n\nTo be clear X was not normal job duties that meant coworkers had to pick up slack X was  asking customers to donate to some charity run by the store. No where in the manual did it say I had to ask for donations and the next year the store policy became no asking for donations after the first week which I was fine with. Asking for donations actually angered customers because they had been asked so many times. I actually got just as many donations not asking as other part time employees one customer even donated $100 and said “I come to your line because you don’t ask me for money everyday.”",

As I was walking the dog, a girl approached me and thought I was her sister walking their black dog (my dog is a mix of black, gray, and white). Her name is/was (?) Phoenix and apparently, she was walking the dog but hadn’t returned and her phone was off. I don’t really watch TV or am on social media a lot (minus Reddit) so I have no idea how that story resolved. But that really validated how I feel. The street I walk our dog on is hardly lit, high trafficked during the day, and I’m literally a throws away in any direction to a sexual predator, according to the sex registry in my area. I’ve learned throughout the years to listen to that gut feeling.",

I wouldn't have usually gave it any mind but something about the way my mom looked or maybe I had overheard the conversation or something put me on edge for some reason. I decided to take my brother, grab the family car, and shadow my mom on her walk. About 4 blocks from my house a cop cars drives up and a cop calmly walks over and starts talking to them. All of a sudden Jane tries to run and the cop has to hold her and calls an ambulance. Turns out she had recently stopped taking her anti-psychotic medication and was having an episode. My mom is running back home to grab her phone when she sees me and I drive her home. She calls Jane's dad who was out searching for her because she disappeared. From what my mom said the conversation she had with Jane was like a kid conversation. Not simplistic but no back and forth, like when two kids are talking at each other about 2 completely different things.  It was a weird experience but taught be to trust my gut.",

            "text": "A little backstory first: I’ve always had bad anxiety when it comes to relationships. So much so that it has ruined most of them. I just get paranoid of something happening even if it’s only because they hadn’t texted me back in an hour or something lol. Like, all the worst scenarios; cheating, not liking me anymore, and worse, something bad happening to them.\n\nAnyway, once, it happened. It was 2013. I was dating this girl in college. Nothing too serious. It was summer and we lived about two hours apart when we weren’t in session (we both lived in the dorms when we were), so we only got to see each other a couple of times that summer. \n\nThis time, however, the day before one of the times we were supposed to hang out, I texted her to confirm our plans. We arranged to meet at her local Walmart at 2pm the next day. She confirmed and told me she was at a party so she  probably wouldn’t communicate much for the rest of the night. I didn’t think anything of it and went about by night.\n\nThe next day rolled around. I texted her that morning. I didn’t get a response, but figured she was still asleep, so I went ahead and started driving. She didn’t respond the whole way there. I start freaking out about the usual stuff. It went from her standing me up, to her not liking me anymore, to her canceling the plans, to the inevitable something terrible has happened to her. This was a normal thing for me, so I just kept trying to brush it off. \n\nAnyway, I get to the Walmart about half an hour early. I texted her saying that I was there. Nothing. I scrolled Facebook and all that. Still nothing. I waited and waited. It was finally about 3 when I gave up and tried to call her to try to get an immediate response. (Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, I didn’t know exactly where she lived because we’d always meet somewhere, else I probably would have driven.) So I call. Nothing. Call back. Nothing. I waited a few minutes and decided I’d try to call one more time before I headed back home.\n\nThis time, someone answered. It was her sister. She was crying. She told me that the girl I was dating (we weren’t official yet) had died the night before. Her and her friend were driving to get food after the party. They were both drunk. They got into a single car accident on a winding road and flew off an embankment. The girl died instantly. The friend, who had been driving, was unscathed.\n\nIt really fucked me up. Like I said, we weren’t too serious, so it wasn’t as bad as if we’d been together a long time, but still. No one wants to hear that. I felt so bad, not just for myself, but for her family and friends. I sent flowers because they weren’t having a public funeral on account of her being pretty mangled. \n\nAnyway, yeah, I can’t say I was prepared for it, even though my mind went there, but it was one of my worst fears come true. Something I’d thought about 1000 times in other relationships before and since, and it never happened, but for the one time, it did. I’d always been anxious in relationships before, but it got way worse. I just kept telling myself that it was a one-time thing, and the odds were that it wouldn’t happen again. There was a good half a decade I couldn’t make any relationship last more than a month because I was too anxious. I think it’d probably be better now, but alas, I haven’t had the opportunity to date anyone for the last 3 years or so. \n\nAnyway, it fucking sucked.",

Now let me rewind the punchline to let you in on a few things about me. And then I'll jump right on into this diaper needing story right after. \n\n1. I'm known as the \"bag lady\" \n\n2. I like to have baby wipes wherever I am \n\n3. I overprepare and ensure I have whatever I need on hand available wherever I go cos you never know when it's needed most \n\n4. It's always good to be in situations I've literally covered my ass for, in ever having to think about cos my overthinking did the job for me already \n\nSo I woke up and as usual had the mild urge to relieve myself. I was in no rush to do so though and I started pottering around in my room until I was more urgently needing the toilet. When it was that time JUST before I was meant to go to the loo my roommate hurriedly gets there just before me and I guess you snooze you lose. I think no big deal maybe she wants to urinate instead of go for a poop... No she had already been appointed mayor of Browntown and was on her way to a good old morning dump, as I'd learn to my horror later on she'd be on the throne for quite some time. \n\nTime is going by and I'm mildly panicking inside cos I don't want to mess myself right there in my room so I escape to the seperate showering area cos if push comes to shove I will gladly just waffle stomp this situation into oblivion and never speak of this again... No it ended up not getting that far. Our bathroom included a shower, a big ass spa bath and had enough room for me to store extra TP, Baby Wipes and loads of extra bags for the rubbish bin. So as the flow of my thoughts and my bowel movements went into overdrive I grabbed the nearest bag I could and liquid lava squirted from my anus erupting like some sort of shameful fondue of diarrhetic protest at me being less proactive about getting up and just going right to the toilet when I needed to! \n\nAt least I had everything at my disposal to clean up after me, I bagged that bag of doodoo more times than was probably needed but I for sure didn't want anyone to mistakenly have it explode on them cos they somehow had a freak accident with the garbage container. I showered up afterwards and headed out for the day at least way more clearminded and \"emptied out\" so I felt like I was flying thereafter and actually in good spirits. \n\nThus ends the day that will never be forgotten by me ever. I look back at it now and have a good belly laugh about it all. But at the time it was the worst shitshow that could have befallen be ever. I was mortified! But you know what they say, shit happens 😂",

            "text": "My senior year of high school, we had a foreign exchange student (We’ll call her B). My best friends and I became extremely close with B- close enough that I would consider us sisters. The year after we graduated and she returned home, B came to visit us for the summer. It was then that we decided we would go to Europe to visit her the next summer. We were all so excited and spent 8+ months planning the trip. That being said, we were all broke college students so our trip was largely dependent on us staying at B’s family home, or her apartment in the city. The plan was to use those places as a home base, and then do day or overnight trips to all the big places we wanted to go so that we wouldn’t be paying hotel fees for the entire 4 weeks we planned to be there. Being the overthinker that I am, I was really stressed about us not having a place to stay. I worked my ass off all year to save up for the trip, and it was still barely enough to afford the plane ticket, I’d be screwed if we had to pay for hotels too. There was no reason for me to be worried about it, B had two different places we could stay, and she had lived with me and each of my friends during her exchange year so we knew there wouldn’t be any issues with living  together. But my brain could not stop. What if there was an emergency and we couldn’t stay at her place any more? What if the house AND apartment burned down? What if her dad showed up and it became unsafe to stay there? (B’s dad had a history of untreated mental illness that resulted in unpredictable and aggressive/violent behavior- he had been in and out of her life for the last year or two). In order to stifle my overthinking I did some extra research and had a couple back up plans just in case. And wouldn’t you know it......\n\n4 days in, B kicked us out without any sort of explanation. We were devastated, and stranded in a foreign country in which we did not speak the language. But thanks to my ever anxious brain.....  ya girl had the Ibis budget motel and a bus route on deck. We ended up spending our entire budget on hotels and hostels. (We weren’t able to change our flights so we had to wait it out). I lost about 12lbs because there were days where I couldn’t afford food. It was certainly an adventure but thanks to my overthinking, it wasn’t one that I was entirely unprepared for.",

Although I've never been able to take a CPR or first aid class, i know the basics of what to do in several medical emergencies and i end up playing these scenarios in my head a lot and researching them online.\n\n1.5 years ago, my grandma was visiting to see me off before I left the country. One morning I noticed that she dropped her pill bottle and just sat down on her bed, staring off into space. My mom talked to her and shrugged it off, but i knew something was wrong as soon as I looked at her. I noted the time and asked her questions to test her awareness and had her smile, but I noticed nothing weird except this strange look in her eyes and her confusion about why she dropped the pill bottle. Then I had her raise her arms and I found the telltale sign of a stroke: one of her arms just wouldn't raise.\n\nI told my mom to call 911, and I chatted with my grandma to help keep her calm and gauge how she was doing. When the paramedics arrived, I was able to give them a rundown of her symptoms and how long they lasted. Turns out she had a minor stroke, which did no harm to her brain. However, these types of strokes are known as a sort of omen for what's to come within months or even weeks if they're not caught. She was put on new meds, a new diet, and some extra exercise and she's now healthier than I've seen her in years. I'm so grateful for all the times i thought about that exact situation, as i knew the signs and how to respond. My grandma is my best friend and I don't know what I would do if i had ignored the signs and she were to have a major stroke later on.",

When I (28F) was five or so, my dad took my little brother (around two years old at the time,) and I on a wagon ride that ended at the nearby video rental store. Now, I LOVED this wagon. It was just a rusting metal yellow wagon, nothing special about it, but it always had a special place in my heart. The video store was a storefront in a suburban neighborhood plaza, and my dad stopped the wagon in front of the store, unloaded us, and \"parked\" the wagon on the sidewalk near the front windows. I immediately balked-- how could he leave my precious wagon outside alone, when anything could happen to it? He assured me everything would be fine and took us inside. I proceeded to follow him around the story on the verge of tears, adamant that something was going to happen to my wagon. I remember that I just couldn't shake the feeling. Eventually he got so fed up that he retorted, \"if you're so worried about that wagon, go stand at the window and stare at it while we pick out videos!\" So I did. I wasn't at the bank of floor-to-ceiling windows for more than 2 minutes when a group of preteen boys ran past and grabbed my wagon by the handle, dragging it away with them as they sped down the plaza.\n\nI. Lost. My. Young. Mind. I just remember screaming out as I burst into tears. My dad looked up, saw it happening, and bolted after them. I remember standing in the aisle sobbing, holding my bewildered brother's hand, as the poor young clerk ogled at us, confused as hell.\n\nLong story not-so short, my dad somehow caught up to them at the end of the plaza...just as the kids' mothers were exiting the store. My dad explained what they did, and the mothers were furious...at my dad for \"chasing them\". He later told my mom that the women actually said \"what's a grown man even have a need for a wagon for? Let them be kids.\" Unreal.\n\nAnyway, we still talk about this story all the time. It might seem minor, but from that day on, my parents always listened a bit more to my intuitions and were more patient with me. Actually, several weird incidences like that happened as I was growing up, and so now my mom always encourages me to listen to my \"overthinking intuitions\", because they rarely steer me wrong!",

I never deposited in my bank account. I had a feeling I might need it later. Fast forward two months and we got hit by two category 4 humongous hurricanes, 2 weeks apart. The second hurricane left the island without power, cellphone service, radio, water for days, weeks, months (depending on the region). Those $300 I ended up lending to my parents after the second hurricane because they had prepared for everything but cash. The small amount of cash helped us through for a few days. They still did a 8 hour line at the bank a few days later. I was scared because there were people robbing everywhere (especially banks) and since there was no cellphone service, I had no idea if my parents were okay for those 8 hours. Very stressful times for many different reasons at once. I don’t wish it upon anyone. \n\nPS. This was 2017 in Puerto Rico. Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria",

I used to ride along if there was a fire close by, hand out bottled water to the firemen... I have always slept with at LEAST a t-shirt and PJ pants on. My logic was if you're house is on fire the last thing you want is to have to stand outside naked and watch it burn... Every night before I lay down, I take keys, wallet, and phone put em in my shoes and put my shoes by my side of the bed.\n\nOne night I wake up and see smoke pouring in from under the door... I knew exactly what to do... I jumped up, grabbed my shoes, quickly opened the window and pushed the screen out and climbed out the window. Then I put my keys and wallet in my pocket and dialed 911 as I put my shoes on. I ran over and moved my car out of the driveway so that the fire truck could pull in closer to the house... \n\nSmh this is where it all went to shit... I can hear sirens in the distance... And suddenly, I see the lights come on thru the window of my 6yo son's bedroom. Yeah... Probably should have updated my fire escape plan when he was born... Panicked I run to the front door. It's locked. And I realized then that I've locked my keys in the car by accident... So I run to the backdoor. Also locked... Then I think \"if the police can kick in the front door serving a no-knock warrant then it can't be that hard to do.\" (That's another story... I was ALLEGEDLY selling marijuana).\n\nI run back around to the front door and i see my son is standing on the porch eating the nastiest, most burnt bag of popcorn... Smh... So he had decided to make popcorn at 2AM and microwaved it WAAAAYY too long. He saw the smoke and just went back to bed. I'm guessing he thought he wouldn't get in trouble if he acted like it wasn't him 🤷🏼‍♂️ I had done all of this because of burnt popcorn... Luckily the fire dept got there and 2 guys helped break into my car to get my keys and 2 other firemen brought the microwave outside and plugged it into the outlet on the light pole and popped a bag of popcorn for the recommended amount of time and I sat there... as they roasted me... for like 30 minutes... while my son climbed all over the fire truck.\n\nMoral of the story is...

I always decided that I needed to make sure that I did not get injured so that I could continue to protect them.\n\nThis came into use a few summers ago when me, my two brothers, and my one brother’s dad went on a camping trip in a secluded campground. It was all good until the second evening. My brother’s dad is an alcoholic and he was drinking. Him and my brothers were joking around, throwing stuff around and all that stuff, while I was reading a book (I usually bring one with me to places when I travel because of my anxiety / it gives me something to do and focus on). Then my brother’s dad said he was done. Of course my brothers keep goofing off and they suddenly knocked his lawn chair over. You know when people say that everything goes completely still and the air changes and you just feel this heavy sense of dread? Well that happened and I knew something bad was gonna happen. Then my brother’s dad picked up the lawn chair and struck my brother (that was not his son) with it before going after his son. I was shocked but I grabbed onto the chair that he was carrying as he went after my little brother and I yelled at him that he didn’t know what he was doing. He told me to let go of the chair now, and I could tell that if I didn’t, there was a chance that it would result in me getting injured. So I let go so that I would be able to still jump in if I had to (which I wouldn’t be able to do if I had gotten injured) and, after a few steps, his father quit going after him. After that, we hid in the bathroom building that was there and the cops were called. Luckily, we were alright, but a LOT of things worked out super perfectly that night and I can only thank God for that.\n\nSo, the next time you’re wondering what you would do in a possibly dangerous situation, it’s not a bad idea to actually think a little bit about it (not too much, but enough to know what to do in the heat of the moment).",

For years every time he had to travel outside the city he would have a full tank of gas and full spare can, even if he only had to go to the next town around 20km.\n\nOne winter he was driving alone back home, it was late at night, with a light snow fall.

After a few hours he notices that the bus, which had it's engine running all that time, had stopped.\n\nMy grandfather got out of the car, went to the bus to check on them. As he suspected the bus had ran out of gas. The cheap bus company had enough fuel to get them to their destination. It must have been around midnight, with at least 6-8 hours before help could have arrived. So my grandfather did the only thing a decent human being would do in that moment. He stayed out in the cold, allowing the kids to take turns warming up in the car. \nWhen help arrived in the morning they were all alive and well. \n\nTLDR: My grandfather got stuck in a snow storm with a bus full of kids, and kept them warm because he refused to leave the city limits without a full tank of gas.",

We broke up before we went, this was the last thing that triggered my depression. Anyway, so we go on that holiday like almost 1000km away from my home trying to forget the entire situation. As we are settled into the holiday home my overthinking and anxiety at the time kept saying \"but what if I run into any of the 2 here\". This is obviously very unlikely but me being me, this seemed like a very real thing. \n\nDay 2 rolls on in, we go to the supermarket and lo and behold I see a dude that looks oddly familiar. \"Nahh it cant be, we are so far away from home\". After surviving that panic attack we get back home and I sit out on the porch. I hear my native language in the house next to us and I am like uhmm what. There is the dude again, panic intensifies but i try to rationalize. It can't be him right? Until I hear one of the other dudes yell his name and he responds.\n\nI really wish I made this up, but from that point on when people talk to me about low odds or coincidence. I will forever have this in the back off my mind. Its been over 5 years now and everything is fine with me. Depression under control, new GF for almost 3 years and I am happy. \n\n\nTLDR; Went on holiday over 1000km away from my home to escape from my breakup with cheating ex.

He told me later at that minute he knew he was going to have to catch the kitten. We must have spent a half hour trying to corner her, with her hissing at us all the while.

At the very start of the pandemic I had a sixth sense and I remember leaving work on a normal day just before lockdown began (overnight we were all told workplaces would close indefinitely) and thinking I feel like this is the last time I’ll ever set foot here again. Weird and completely true. I’d been there for 16 years and was highly respected in my field - fine art restoration - the field itself was thriving at the time, if niche, and I had no concrete reason to begin to doubt things. As soon as I was furloughed (thank god) and despite promises from my boss, who was like a father to me after all this time, I had a sneaky suspicion that not only was I going to lose my much loved job, but that my wider career was going to be impossible given the economic climate and that I would be out of work for years to come. It was very difficult accepting that this could be true, given the long years I’d had specialising in my field. I just knew that in all probability given a pandemic combined with Brexit and change of regulations that on balance that there would be no call for a specialist such as me for a long time. My reputation would mean nothing in the face of such a crisis. Oh god how I was right. \n\nI thought, For now I’ve got furlough pay, then I’ll have redundancy and whatever happens I won’t be earning for a while so let’s take this opportunity to retrain. I’d better get ahead of the curve, just in case, because as soon as the redundancies start and the economy begins to tank everyone will want to retrain and we won’t even get into education if I wait to see what will happen... so I thought long and hard about what I’d like to do, and quietly signed up for a college diploma in horticulture, with a view to eventually working in historic gardens, starting that September. Talk about foresight. As less than a month before my course was due to begin I was indeed made redundant. And I was able to take up my place like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat. It’s been a difficult year, and an extremely rewarding transition. \n\nEarly on I tried talking to my closest previous colleague about my thoughts on what we were facing and he just didn’t accept it, I tried urging him to take this time to think about his future and begin to make plans, unfortunately to this day he still believes that somehow things ‘will just work out’ if he waits long enough. He still has no work, has not done anything for over a year and now the redundancy payment has run out. He is a hard lesson to me. Comparing the two of our responses to this crisis has really opened my eyes, and not a little devastating to see. I love him and hope that somehow the market will recover for him soon, but my spidery-sense is not optimistic. \n\nUltimately Gotta take the time to look hard at your own life, think things thru and take responsibility for yourself and yes, make back up plans because the world owes us no favours and shit happens.",

My father questioned this a bit and jokingly said the what if they go bankrupt. And the staff said they are a very well known club in Hong Kong (normally requires annual membership of HKD 1 million if not for a wedding banquet) and how would they go bankrupt. And my father said, as big as Lehman Brothers can go bankrupt so why not.\n\nFast forwards half a year that we already paid for more than half the payment in advance. They indeed go bankrupt.\n\nWell, there’s no way we can prepare for this. And if according to common practice of bankruptcy we wouldn’t be getting a dime back (as there are more “important” people ahead of the queue so to speak to get their money back.) But since the founder of that club doesn’t agree with that discussion and he personally arranged us to get back all the money from a law firm within a few days.\n\nThat’s a roller coaster ride and while we are very thankful we can get the money back (if not we would be broke and can’t hold a wedding banquet), we still need to find another place. It was then half a year prior to our wedding date, and in Hong Kong people normally need to book for that in advance for at least a year.\n\nThankfully, we can find one that still have opening, partially because we’re Christian and so our wedding date is not a “fortunate date” (in Chinese culture people superstitiously assign dates to be good/bad for a certain activities including wedding. So a “fortunate date” for wedding normally is fully booked like at least a year or even 2 in advanced.)\n\nEverything went smooth for our wedding.

Now I don't know if Scouts do this all over the world or only in the Netherlands where I am from, but we were going on a hike (with a small group of people, only one phone for emergencies and instead of a map for navigation, you get these map puzzles for navigation techniques, which you had studied before the hike ofcourse). There was a time limit and along the road there were a few stops with games and other puzzles to do. Great fun, I loved these kind of hikes!\n\nBut one of the puzzles we had to do was one we didn't learn. So we had no idea how to solve it. Luckily, I always came well prepared for everything! Before we left, I doubted about taking a small booklet with me with the explanations of some common Scout puzzles. I took it, just in case. \n\nNow I remember the group telling me I brought way too much stuff for our hike and I had to carry it all myself (I also always brought things like band aids, bug spray and a pocket knife, just in case!) Which was fine by me cause I liked being well prepared. But when we were standing there with no idea how to solve this puzzle, I checked the booklet just in case, and there it was! A very detailed description of how to solve the puzzle! So the group was really happy I brought it!\n\n*I have more similar scout stories to this one, but this one was the funniest. Being well prepared when going on a hike is nothing to be ashamed of, but make sure you take only small amounts, (for example of liquids) and only absolute necessities because I have also seen people hike with huge backpacks filled with... well lets say not essential products like extra makeup and stuff!*",

No. All because they wanted to be religious tourists and travel to visit a fucking temple, out of state using public transport.\n\nNow after their own parents, siblings and children are still criticising them for their lack of empathy, intelligence and discipline, have they learnt their lesson?

Luckily though I had thought about this situation many times before and very slowly and obviously turned away from them. I then took my school bag off and made very obvious motions in one part of the bag. Of course when the police got to me they immediately began searching my person including the trusty nutsack. Once they had established I had nothing on me they went to town searching the part of my bag I had my hands in. Eventually the cop searching my bag hands it back to me and I'm allowed to leave. Dude only searched one part of the bag! Hahaha\nEver since that day I now constantly overthink the potential power of misdirection",

Once I figured out that he had less of an age difference with my grandparents than my mum, it was just wondering from there on, and the fact that he was a chain smoker was not helpful at all. \n\nSo growing up I always wondered when it would happen. Would he be at my university graduation, my wedding? See me in my 30s? I made up every single scenario in my head on how it would be to live that experience with or without him. \n\nSo when he got sick when I was 16 it was no surprise, we could say he had it coming after 50 years of 4 packs a day. He was too sick to come to my GCSE graduation (USA folks - this is at 16) so I went to see him at hospital, and he spent the summer at home with oxygen and still smoking. It was all downhill from there and 4 months after getting sick he passed away as I started IB. \n\nNo highschool graduation, no university graduation (in 2 months), no wedding, no 30s.

I decided to head over to his place (lived in an apartment) but my brain was screaming ‘check  the balcony first. Go to the other side of the street and look at the balcony. Something is wrong.’ \nI walked over to the other side of the street, looked up to my boyfriend sitting on the hammock I bought him. He threw a party, had invited a few girls, and was making out and cuddling one of them. \nIf I went into the room, It would have been a horrible experience to see that. But my mind told me to check first. \n\nI sent him a picture (he liked to deny deny deny) and called him. I even heard a girl saying ‘your girlfriend keeps calling you?’ So everybody knew. \n\n2 hours later, I get a reply to the photo. All I received was ‘:)’... a smiley face. That’s the last conversation we had. A few weeks later (the new girl went home with another guy infront of him and his backup girl had vanished) he messaged me a few times trying to get back together. I never responded and he was blocked pretty quickly. 2 months later, a new girlfriend (who he probably cheats on...) \n\nThat’s it. A whole year down the drain. \nI got into my car. Felt relief it was finally over. Went to my friends house. And sobbed. I never spoke to him or saw him again. I am so happy I saw it with my own eyes, got the closure I needed and never looked back.",

Like they blatantly told my mom how I felt wronged being hit for such a silly thing,  when I told em not to so that, because otherwise the asshole would kick me out. After the first few calls that day, before I arrived at the library I was out of battery, so no contact with anyone until evening. \n\nWent back to home, and I immediately knew something was off. \n\"Pack your bags. Get the fuck out.\" That was the asshole speaking. \n\"So they told you about it\"\n\"Damn right they did. Get out.\"\nYou know you're in the wrong here. You have no right hitting me.

            "text": "I was hired by a firm that was worried their IT Manager was going to screw up their move to a new building.  After reviewing the plan and looking for risks, there were a lot of obscure risks but with high-severity outcomes.  For example, everything was moving in one truck, which means each node of their database clusters would be in the same truck, their backup would be in the same truck, etc.  There was also no provisions made if reassembling their IT infrastructure took more time than expected and went past the open of business on Monday morning.  When I worked out a detailed plan with critical path and dependencies, it was obvious his plan had to room for anything to go wrong.  The level of detail in planning was superficial at best, and I picked up on a couple early red flags, like the new data center having the wrong power outlets installed for the UPS models that were moving.\n\nI made recommendations to mitigate these risks, which, of course, added cost to the move.  Backups had to go in a separate vehicle and be safely on-site at the new location before anything at the old location was shut down.  Any redundant equipment, like database clusters, network stacks, firewall clusters, etc, had to go in separate truckloads with the first load delivered before the second could be loaded.  Detailed plans were made for each system, so even if the IT guy died, we could call in additional resources from my company and get the job done.  Dry runs through the plans helped refine them.  The additional planning cost tens of thousands of dollars in billable hours, but the CEO saw the risk and understood our value.\n\nThe IT manager argued against the need for all of them and really took offense to the lack of trust his senior leadership had in him and his abilities.  Although we had to work together on this move, our relationship was adversarial and somewhat combative.  The only way we managed to function at all was because I had convinced him that if he followed my planning and anything went wrong, it would be my throat to choke and not his.\n\nOn the day of the move, the expected rain unexpectedly turned to freezing rain and then became an ice storm.  The move still occurred but took twice as long as planned.  One truck, containing 1/2 of the IT equipment, slid off the road and into a swamp.  Equipment was damaged.  The ice storm caused a massive blackout, so we had no power until late Sunday night, delaying reassembly.  Every contingency plan was activated, every available resource was put on the project, and, by 9am Monday, every system was back online and operational, even if resiliency and performance were degraded.\n\n9/10 times it would have been a smooth move and the strategy of shut it down, load it into a truck, unload it, power it on, would have worked, but in this case, that truck driving into a swamp could have taken the business with it.",

My wife often makes fun of me as it seems silly to carry my keys and wallet in my pocket to the bathroom, garage, etc. I don’t know why, but I just feel uneasy if I’m missing them in my pockets.\n\nAnyway my wife and I went up to the family vacation property 4 weeks ago to de-winterize and check on things for my grandfather. The day was very warm for the season (+10 degrees C) but the nights still dipped down to -3 or lower and still snowed.\n\nOne of the days, my wife and I were mostly outside, and because It was so warm, we only wore a long sleeve shirt and jeans / leggings for either of us. I had a nice campfire going and we spent that evening sitting by the fire in our light pants and shirts. \n\n9:00 rolls around and it’s getting pretty darn cold. The fire has kept us warm but it’s dying down, so we get up and go to head inside when I remember my wife had the house keys. I go to open the door and I realize the door was locked. I ask her where the house keys are and she says on the “counter in the kitchen, why?” I look inside the window and sure enough, there is our only set of keys, sitting on the counter inside the window. Unfortunately I broke my rules that day and my car keys were in the cottage as well, but at least my phone and wallet were with me still.\n\nLong story short, the property is pretty far from any civilization and is basically 1-2 hours driving and probably 1/2 to 1 day walking to a nearby town, we also had no neighbours home at that time and we were 4 or so hours from anyone we knew. So we were pretty stuck. And it was staring to dip down to 0 degrees.\n\nCold and a bit worried I had to figure out how to get in. I decided to try jamming my expired Costco card in the door jam which worked perfectly, it pushed the door pin in, and inside the cottage we went. It could have been much worse (and expensive) if I did not obsessively carry my wallet and phone with me (except keys that day apparently) and we would have had to break a window to get in. Or wait for someone to save us. \n\nShe no longer makes fun of me\n\nEdit: writing my story I forgot the question exactly :P technically speaking I was unprepared for this situation but I would have been if I was able to be OCD that day",

            "text": "So I took a bailiff to court for violent assault. Before the court date, I received a call from the arresting officer suggesting I drop the case as I would be unlikely to win.\n\nWell that was odd because he was the one advising me to take the bailiff to court in the first place.\n\nI had cctv camera evidence of the assault, and one eyewitness.\n\nSo I was thinking of any possible scenario where he would change his view. The bailiff was an officer of the court so maybe knew some of the police, and the police are just one big boys club after all. I started recording my calls in case this officer called me again.\n\nThen, sure enough I got a call from another police officer, and he was extremely direct. He told me there was no possible way I could win the case as the bailiff was employed by the courts, and also mentioned a several decade old offence of mine, and how it would get brought up in court. He said he would make me regret ever taking this to court.\n\nSo I told him the call was recorded (it was). He yelled at me “you fucking twat!” and cut the call off.\n\nSo in court, almost the first thing to happen was this guy stood up and announced he was the chief police commissioner, and that the bailiff was his son in law, and that he was a calm and reasonable man. So that explained everything.\n\nWell it appears that the bailiff had made up this long story about how I had goaded him into attacking me. \n\nSo we played the video of the whole event. The judges only needed to see it once. \n\nThe judges awarded me their judgement and compensation. The guy lost his licence.\n\nThen we played the audio of the police phone threat. \n\nIn the following months the commissioner was found to have tried influencing a few different court cases, so I’m guessing his officers rolled on him. He was sacked in disgrace.\n\nThey didn’t even allow him to leave quietly.\n\nEdit: This was back in 2012, and I posted each event up (as it happened) on Reddit (under a different username).",

He'd left the gate open while he was in the front yard and they saw us as we passed.\n\nOne jumped on my dog's back while the other circled around to his head.\n\nI let out a guttural scream, which stopped the one advancing on his head. I then proceeded to kick the one on his back to the ground.\n\nThey regrouped and came at him again. Cue another scream from me and trying to tower over them. That gave us enough time to get the hell away.\n\nMy dog did end up with an injury, though thankfully not one that caused him to retire. Poor guy was a magnet for dog attacks. I took a bite for him on one occasion, another time I wasn't fast enough to prevent ended with his tail bleeding. Meanwhile he was a gentle giant who never fought back. My first and current dog were/are not magnets for attacks so go figure.\n\n\\*i. I had asked the question of what to do in a dog attack situation and was told to let it play out/protect myself. That didn't sit right with me. I understand why they said it but allowing him to be attacked without trying to protect him was not something I could live with. No judgement on other handlers choices whatsoever.  \nii. I have enough vision (depending on lighting) to get an idea what's going on, particularly in close attacks.",

            "text": "All of last year even before Covid hit America, I was worried my dad would die. Everyone told me how ridiculous this was. Everyone told me how it was just my anxiety. My therapist told me it was just my anxiety. \n\nHe was 46 and in good shape. His bmi was normal. He had an active job, but still I was really worried about it. I remember at one point last summer asking about his life insurance policy at work and if he had a will/where we could find it. I begged him repeatedly to to get a check up and to be more careful with covid restrictions. Those last two caused a lot of arguments. After my grandmother died earlier that year I made sure to ask what he would want if we had to make medical decisions for him. We talked about what funeral arrangements he wanted. \n\nTwo weeks later he had a mild case of covid and then three weeks later had a massive heart attack and his heart stopped in the living room. My brother did compressions until the paramedics could bring him back. My brother and I had to call the shots on that one and at one point had been told to make a decision on an LVAD for him. He ended up taking a turn for the worst so we let him go, but would have anyway because of his insistence he not live plugged into a machine.  We had him cremated; his exact words were, \"I don't care what you do with my body, whatever y'all want, and sits on my mantle. Were having an outdoor memorial for him this summer when more of the family has been vaccinated.\n\nIt really sucked. He ended up having a situation almost identical to the one my grandmother had on my mom's side only weeks before down to the same surgeries and use of an impella device. As soon as I heard they did the impella from my brother, I knew he would die and he did about 40 hours later. \n\nHis death was still awful for me but I'm glad that I was prepared for what he wanted and never once had to question if we made the right decisions. It is really important to talk to your loved ones about their end of life care even if nobody thinks it will happen anytime soon.",

After experiencing a few issues with connecting our presentation materials to the customer’s TV or projector, I began to make customer-specific “packs” for the cables and adaptors we would need at each customer site. Well, when traveling to a new customer that I had never been to before, a fellow coworker told me what I would need, as he had been there before. Even after gathering all of those supplies, I still couldn’t stop worrying that something would be different and I wouldn’t be prepared. So, naturally, I went out and got a 60ft HDMI cord. \n\nFast forward to the day of the meeting. Just in case, I dragged my boss to the customer site an hour early and we are sitting in a cafe in the lobby. I get a frantic call from my coworker who is remotely participating, saying that the customer called them asking where we were and that the meeting had already started. In a sheer moment of idiocy, I had made an error in converting the time zones and was a full hour off. Well, at least we were already in the building, right? My boss and I booked it upstairs and quickly signed in and were lead into...a brand new conference room. At this point we are 10 minutes into a 1 hour meeting that was already supposed to be overflowing with content; I mean, we had everything about this presentation planned down to the minute. I am trying to connect the presentation at record speed, but nothing is working. At this point, I say  screw it and pull out my 60ft HDMI cord from my very small backpack and plug my laptop directly into the TV across the room. \n\nThe look on our customer contact’s face was truly priceless. At the end of the meeting, the customer’s highest level boss said something along the lines of, “I’ve never seen someone so prepared.”",

Husband hit his brakes, lightly bumped the elk (who was as shocked to see us and we were him) and he just kept on going.  We were so lucky that evening and have laughed and made nervous comments about it many times thru the years.",

            "text": "TL;DR - Overthinking caused one of the greatest sins I have done in my entire life\n\nThere was this time where my overthinking went to its absolute extreme and neither good or bad. A friend (or rather just someone friendly approached me as I am approachable) came to me for advice because his circle of friends was having personal problems. First, I let him tell me the exact details. At least for his side. Then I asked the others as well. Their points contradicted each other. And to be perfectly honest, all of them were really toxic towards each other. I guess a \"double-sided\" friendship as you may call it.\n\nSo I tried to gather all options I could think of. There were quite a lot because the situation could go in many ways. So I narrowed it down to 2 very obvious and simple choices. A) I simply refuse to help. B) I'll try to fix their broken friendship. But a thought crossed my mind which divided both choices. \"Is mending a toxic friendship really good? Is there really hope for it to be fixed?\" So I was introduced with a 3rd option; To play with their thoughts while showing them the truth.**This is where my overthinking went to its extreme**. I came up with a few \"schemes\" to gently let them realize the truth while making a grand finale at the end. I won't go much in to detail. I'll just say the things I did were horrifyingly smart. I gave them \"mysterious\" advice that they weren't able to read between the lines and took it at face value. I contacted them using different accounts to spread fake (but true) gossip. I have done other things during that but I don't really want to remember it anymore.\n\nThus, the finale approaches and they held a group talk of some sort. To let out all of their thoughts. They held it in the upper classroom (btw this happened during my HS years). So yeah I heard what was going on without really getting too close to the place where they were at. I've already predicted the outcome but I never thought I would be extremely accurate of how it would actually go on. Again, won't go too much in to detail. It's a painful memory. I was **prepared** of the outcome but I never expected the amount of guilt that followed later that day.\n\n2 years passed since graduation and their parting. 3 of them contacted me and just really wanted to know how were things doing. I never told one of them that the other 2 did that as well. Turns out they said they've been doing better than ever. Each of them got a new circle of friends. Living prosperous college lives and were genuinely happy. But I occasionally wonder how would things be if I chose a different option? Would I have been able to mend their friendship while showing them the truth? And the guilt also remains.\n\nIf any of you have read this far then you probably think this is fake, right? Well due to preserving my anonymity I can't provide the actual proof. All I can say is that it is up to you to believe. I just wanted to keep on confessing this to relieve a bit of that guilt.

Grandma started going downhill just as COVID became a big thing, and there was serious talk of moving her out of the nursing home and back into her house so she could have visitors in her final days. I visited, cleaned the whole house, and made a \"bed-rest box\" of activities she liked. Sudoku, cross words, and word search puzzle books. Bob Ross on DVD along with some watercolors, crayons, colored pencils, and coloring books. An old tablet with solitaire games and a memory card absolutely full of pictures and videos of the family, plus a one-touch button and you've got my brother (who lives one block over) on video call. Books such as a large-print bible, her favorite bird book, a book of Texas/Oklahoma State colleges jokes (apparently they have a feud), and some Garfield comic books. Also some easy to play group board/card games she liked: Sorry, Uno, Trouble, and such. I believe there were a few other items, but those are the main bits. Shoved the box into her bedroom closet for her return. That weekend, the gradual decline of health (estimated remaining time of a couple months) became a downward spiral and she was gone within a few days. Never made it back home.\n\nMy dad and step mom bought grandma's house as-is and moved in. All of grandma's stuff is still in the house and they've been going through it slowly over the past year. Turns out my step mom just discovered she has lung cancer and they're removing a good chunk of her lung in a week or two. They're naturally upset and she's not sure what she's going to do while on bed-rest. They were a little shocked when I went into grandma's old room (still the same and currently used as storage) and pulled out that box I'd made.

For years I’ve always gone over every scenario possible and what I would do in each case. For example I would think “What if I was in a gas station and by the sodas and someone came in the front door with a gun?”  I had a plan that I would push the sodas through the cooler as the other side is the cooler where they stock it. I assumed that the cooler where they stocked it must have an access door that they load the products in that would be my escape. For years before bed and even driving I would think of different scenarios, what I would do or say, and how I would escape. Two years ago I was in a CVS (this is a store which has a pharmacy, small amount of food products, cosmetics etc). I was ironically by the soda/wine area but had a straight view of the front door where the doors slide open and one enters. These two early 20s men came in and I IMMEDIATELY had this gut sinking feeling they were going to rob the damn place. I hit panic mode and left right out of the door they came in. When I got in my car I felt like a dumbass because I heard nothing and it’s not like they came running out after or anything. So I still needed the products and drove 15 miles to another damn store to get said products. Two days later on our neighborhood app (Nextdoor) the title talked about the CVS robbery. The two men who came in to the store did rob the place , they first went to the pharmacy in the back which was closed (hence them walking into the store and not immediately going to the cashier) they then went, scoped out the place, pulled a gun on the front cashier who happened to be ex military. This checkout guy I’ve seen a ton of times and he’s just a shorter kind of stocky guy. The cashier asked that the guys let his employees and customers leave and they agreed surprisingly. He then attacked the main guy with the gun, pulling the gun away and both men fleed into the apartment buildings next to the store where they were hiding and caught by police. I could not sleep that night. The other issue is I suffer from OCD so I feel like if I think things now they are all the sudden going to come true. I know this is not logical but since the robbery I’ve had these major asinine scenarios pop into my head which prevent me from carrying on with some normal life activities. (Example:  I can’t go past my knees in our ocean with my kids as I’ve had several thoughts of sharks attacking my kids and me having to provide a tourniquet for their limb. Overthinking to the point where I specifically wear bathing suits that have a string long and thick enough on it to be a successful tourniquet if needed).  I know I need some meds and therapy for sure but my fellow overthinkers know the plague of a constant racing mind.",

I spring into action and start grabbing blankets and jackets and anything we can use to keep her from getting colder. While my friend runs those out I call an ambulance. After a complicated call (I don’t know the address, the street had the same name as another street in the area) they are on their way. \n\nWe manage to handle it until EMTs arrive and when we do they tell us that her internal temperature was giving at 85 Fahrenheit (basically at lower and she’d be dead). \n\nThey also were a little suspicious of our story (him coming out to a weird call) but in the end it all worked out. \n\nTL;dr my friend over thought about a phone call, I ended up having to use all the hypothermia medical training in the scout handbook.",

For example someone who had lost a leg adapted within weeks because they had a really bad break when they were young that kept them off the leg, stuff like that. I became obsessed with being prepared for the loss so I would tie an arm behind my back for 3 days or put in earplugs for a week. My mom hated the week i went blind.

One day, we got one from a woman who had previously lived in another state and worked as a psychiatrist. She then had a six year gap in her resume before applying now to be an office assistant. It was fairly normal to see a gap in women's resumes like that. They could've had a child and decided to stay home until the child started school. No biggie. And hey, people move all the time, so that could be explained away, too. But why would a psychiatrist now want to be an office assistant? That's such a down grade, and we were a government agency so the pay was terrible. I Googled her, which was NOT part of our standard procedure. I'd never done it for an applicant before nor since. But something just wasn't right and I couldn't stop thinking about it. Turns out she had defrauded Medicare out of millions of dollars and lost her license. That six year gap in her resume was her prison sentence. \n\n2) background info: during my mom's second marriage, my older step brother abused me in multiple ways. Thankfully we eventually got out of that situation, but we currently only live an hour away from those people, so we're very much still looking over our shoulders. About four years ago, I randomly got a phone call from some guy. I thought it was a wrong number, until he said, \"do you know (ex step brother)\". I panicked, said no, and blocked the number. I didn't recognize the voice, and ex step brother has a fairly common name, so my mom kept telling me to calm down, it probably was truly a wrong number and the name was just a coincidence.\n\nBut I couldn't stop thinking about it. Had he found me? I thought he was currently in jail for some other unrelated offense? \n\nI Googled the phone number. It was a cell phone registered to some random woman in a town nearby.  That just made the whole thing seem weirder. Googled her name until I found her Facebook. She's dating someone. Click onto his Facebook. Most recent status says he's just out of jail, glad to see his girlfriend and their kids, and get his life back on track. He was in the same jail as ex step brother.\n\nChanged my phone number and I don't give it out to anyone except close family members now. Anyone else can email me. Was I being paranoid and weird doing all that googling? Sure, but I was right. It allowed me to take steps to protect myself. Haven't heard or seen a peep from him since.",

As a result, I have a makeshift first aid kit in my camelback (a sort of backpack that holds water connected to a tube, you use it to drink without stopping). I use it whenever I fall or generally just need to patch myself up when I can't get off the trails quickly.\n\nAnyway one time I'm riding the loop around my local Greenway. It's around four miles, and I'm casually biking. I still have my Camelback though since it's really hilly and a pain to try to start on again. I'm mostly through it, and I'm at a part where the trail crosses over a large river, then half a mile later, back down it. At one point, there's a wide deertrail that you can use to get to the riverbed. At this point, I'm tired and I take a break to check the time. I walk down to the river as I normally do. It's calm and I really like sitting by it. But this time, when I walk down, I hear someone huffing and making that noise when you suck air between your teeth. Basically, it sounded like they were in pain. I flowed the noise, calling out to whoever it was. I was saying something along the lines of, \"Hello? Call out to me. I have a first aid kit. I can help!\"\n\nAfter a few seconds, they called out, \"Over here! I'm by the river! Please, hurry!\"\n\nI run to them to see what was wrong. When I got there, there was a kid sitting on a rock. We'll call him Jacob. He was probably around 15 or so. He was leaning over his leg, and holding it tightly. As I walk over, he lift his hands to show me what it is. He had two small puncture wounds, side by side, with the skin around them puffy and red. A snakebite. Where I live we have cottonmouths, and I've seen quite a few personally. I didn't know what snake did this, but I was terrified. I didn't know how to help, but I had to try something.\n\n\"O-okay. Um, I have some stuff. I don't know if it will help, but you need to work with me on this, okay?\"\n\nJacob nodded his head hastily.\n\nAs I pulled out a spare water bottle, I walked him through what I'm going to do.\n\n\"Okay, so first things first. What did the snake look like?\"\n\n\"It was orange-ish, and it kinda had these darker stripes on its back.\"\n\nI'm not the best with snakes, but it sounded like a rat snake. I told him that they aren't poisonous, but I'm going to call 911 and try to get some paramedics over. We weren't far from a hospital. We were literally in the woods behind it, so after the phone call, it should only be a few minutes until they get here.\n\nI talked Jacob through what I'm about to do. I give him the water bottle and a single Benadryl. Once he swallowed that, I took the bottle and started washing off his wound. He started crying, saying that it hurt like hell. I tried to comfort him, saying that the paramedics will be here soon. I took a roll of gauze and stared wrapping it tightly around the wound. Once it was all dressed, I told him what to do.\n\n\"Okay, so I think it's only a rat snake, like I told you, but I can't be certain. If it was venomous, there is venom in your bloodstream right now. If so, you can't let it get to your heart. So, what you need to do it to sit down and try to calm down. Take some deep breaths. The Benadryl will help. I'm going to help you up onto the main trail, and we'll find a bench. I'll wait with you until the help arrives.\"\n\nOnce he was settled, I got him talking about himself, about anything. I was trying to get his mind off the snake bite. I learned that he had been coming down to the river for the past month or so. He apparently had been studying the life cycle of a species of frogs for a science project. He was a sophmore in highschool. He had a goldendoodle named Danny, and he had a younger sister. Once he was done talking, he had calmed down a lot. He said that he was feeling a lot better and how he owes a lot to me. I just told him that I would feel like shit if I didn't help.\n\nWe sat in silence and just watched people pass by for the next few minutes until the paramedics arrived. They checked out the wound, and agreed that it was a rat snake from Jacob's description. They took off the gauze and rewrapped it with a new layer. They thanked me for helping, and walked him back to the entrance, presumably to get the bite checked on by a doctor.\n\nI'm sorry that this was so long. I've just wanted to put this story somewhere and this seemed like the best spot to do so. This may not fit into overthinking, but I definitely overprepared. I don't know how Jacob is, all I saw of him was that day. Again, sorry if this was a bit dramatic. I just felt like a hero for weeks after it. I hope you enjoyed my story!\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for whoever just got me to 1k karma! You're a legend.",

            "text": "I'm always carrying a bunch of stuff in my backpack. \n\nI could be pills (Acetamonophen, ibuprophen, benadryl), a ziploc bag of tissue, a tote bag, an oversize thick plastic bag, bandaid, masking tape, small mesuring tape, a single shoe lace I found on the ground (not kidding, always told myself it could be useful) and a cleaning rag. I've started doing this in secondary school, then college, then adult life. (Same backpack too, I've been carrying it for 13 years. I take care of my stuff)\n\n---\n\nWhy do one need a cleaning rag in his bag? Because you never know. \n\nOne time we were doing a team project in college, my friend spilled her coffee on the table, I was a matter of time before our documents were soaked. Low and behold, me the guy always ready for everything pull out my rag and saved the day.\n\nA few weeks prior to that event, still in college, I arrive early to my class, like always. Suddenly one guy who's usually always late came early, dropped his bag and rush out since he needed to get his project from the computer at the other end of the building ('cause he didn't do it the night before, I guess he liked being late). However, we had a policy, keep the room clean, no dirt of melted snow on the floor. We are in Quebec and there was snow outside, so our boots got all dirty and leave water on the floor, and there are folks who don't wear boots and switch to shoes inside, instead they just wear shoes and make the place dirty. So the guy was rushing and saw the mess he left on the ground in panic, he had to get his project on his drive, plus wipe the floor, before the teacher arrived in the class/studio. You know what happens next, I pull out my trusty little rag and wipe the floor clean, saving the guy's fate. \n\n---\n\nWhy do one need a small mesuring tape in his bag? Because you never know.\n\nWe had an evaluation in one of my classes in college, we had to reproduce a shoe box, a real one we had in the class, and animate it in C4D, in a matter of time. Most people just eyeball it, make a rectangular box and calls it a day. I cannot simply do some random shape, it said \"reproduction\", I needed the mesurements. We were post-production students, not the kind of folks who carry the means to mesure object in their daily lives... except for me of course, 'cause I'm the weird one always ready for everything. So I pulled out my mesuring tape at the start of the class before people arrived, except for the teacher he was always early, and proceed to get the right mesurement from the physical box and thus got a perfect shape for my CG shoebox. \n96% on that evaluation, way higher than most people.\n\n---\n\nWinter coat. It's necessary if you live in Canada. A few years ago I got myself one with loads of pockets. I love pockets, you can store all sorts of things in there. A zipploc bag full of tissues, a reflecting high visibility bracer, spare coins if you need to take the bus and got no cards, or no spare change in your pocket, and what about a spare set of gloves?\n \nI already have a pair of glove, why two? Because you never know.\n\nStill in college, we are doing a project where we first needed to film some good looking shots during the night, 'cause we needed night lights on buildings and such. So it's a winter night, a beautiful one too, with thick slow falling snow, and fridgid air. However, one guy in our team didn't prepped as well as he thought, he forgot to bring gloves and we kinda needed fingers to operate a DSLR. \n\nYou know the drill, they knew the drill, surprise secondary pair of gloves directly from yours truly. Saved him from his demise of frozen fingers.\n\n---\n\nCongratulation, you have been invited to a party in a shack resort, friends and frendly coworker will be making a potlock!\nI hate food waste, I grew up in the country side and was frugal before I even knew it was a thing. If a group of adult in their late 20s will make a potlock, surely there will be leftovers. I always keep some plastic container, basic one you can buy at the dollar store, that I actually got from margerine containers that I cleaned because it's the exact same model. It sits in my cupboard, waiting to get used.\n\nI brought 5 of them at the party, why you ask? Because you never know.\n\nThe potlock was sorta fun, but inebriated cooking, and inebriated planning before the cooking leads to questionable results. Leftovers happenned, more than they thought. I hate wasting food, and the friend who organized the party, what a great guy, also stated to avoid wasting food as much as possible, but alas, it happenned. No one had containers for leftovers, except for good old me, who gave my cheap container to save the day, and the food.\n\nI also brought spare reusable shopping bags at the party. I was part of the cleaning team, lots of stuff was left by the others, lots of stuff was brought at my place thanks to those bags. I mean there was a whole barely openned can of maple syrup, that stuff is expensive. I just wrapped it up in saran wrap and put a rubberband (that I had in my bag you guessed it) and it was sealed. I put a beer bottle box at the bottom of my bag so it could sit up right. \n\n---\n\nCovid happenned, we're all sent home, fear settles in and there's no food at the grocery because people bought everything for the confinement?\nGuess who had loads of canned food way before march 2020. The neighbor? The old cat lady down the street? Elvis Presley on his island? No, me.\n\nWhy having loads of canned food in your cupboard? ***bEaCaUsE yOu NeVeR kNoW***.\n\n---\n\nI'm always ready for every eventuality, friends learned it with time. I like making fun of myself for this, I think it's ridiculous sometimes, but if I'm not prepped I always have bad feelings. Overthinking made me win more than it made me lose that's a fact.",

As soon as I received the call I went there and was able to manage the situation: sending well meaning fussing coworkers to the next room, put a jacket under my colleague's head and just sat next to him while the seizure passed, gave a report to ambulance personnel and then had a talk with every single coworker about the situation och their feelings about what happened. Some needed to cry, some vent, others wanted to know what they could do in the future, et cetera. We had a very good exchange about this and we all kind of felt like a big family at the end of it.\n\nThanks to all the people who've shared your stories of emergencies on social media like Reddit, your first hand accounts have helped me imagine countless scenarios and helped me act when something really happened.",

We told them about our forthcoming trip and asked them for a few handy phrases to use. After many drinks, the suggestions went from useful to crass and obnoxious pickup lines. One of the more douchey phrases happened to be, “Do you have a sister?” (Ha ha)\n\nFast forward to a month later....My buddy and I are having a great time visiting Amsterdam, and squeeze into a full train back to Berlin. On the train, we met up with a bunch of local football hooligans who were sitting atop cases of beer and drinking rowdily—we soon became fast friends in spite of the obvious language barrier. They shared their beer, curious to chat it up with some stoned Americans. We traded stories and eventually became the entertainment for the whole train car. \n\nAt one point, one of the locals lamented that he was always getting carded because he looked young, and his ID made him look even younger. His friends made him pass his ID around for a quick laugh at his baby face.\n\nWhen it came to me, I couldn’t contain my buzzed excitement. In perfectly confident German, I boldly asked aloud: “Hast du eine Schwester?!” (Do you have a sister?)\n\nThe whole train went silent in surprise at my sudden mastery of the language... and then erupted in boisterous laughter. Prost.",

            "text": "Strangely enough, COVID-19. Back at the end of 2014, my dad passed away. I'm his only child and my parents were divorced, so he left everything me, including his small studio condo. \n\nHe wasn't a rich man by ANY means, but the condo is real estate. He was a slob though, so the condo was in bad shape. It took me five years to fix it up so I wouldn't have to sell it in \"as is\" condition. I kept paying the roughly $300 a month association dues and the annual property taxes. And when I could scrape together a few hundred dollars every few months, I'd fix something.\n\nThroughout the entire process, absolutely EVERYONE told me I should just sell it and take what I could get. When I first got it, it probably would have sold for $80,000 max in the condition it was in. But I ignored everyone and held it. A couple of people even insisted I should rent it out and refused to listen when I said the condition was so bad that I'd basically be a slumlord if I did. \n\nIn August of 2020, I finally put it up for sale after fixing it to the point it was livable and at market value. It sold on January 14th for $265,000. It took over 5 years, but I'd made what my father left me valuable again.\n\nThen lockdown hit and I found myself unemployed. The money from the condo got me through the past year. I was able to avoid filing for unemployment. I've been able to pay the bills. \n\nI was able to take care of all my mom's sudden medical expenses when she was hospitalized last May because of kidney failure. I was able to pay for extended skill nursing care for months after the doctor's got her off the respirator and breathing on her own again. And I was able able to cover all of her funeral costs after she died from two heart attacks during dialysis in late July.\n\nIf I hadn't overthought my father's condo, 2020 would have destroyed me financially on top of destroying me emotionally. I'd likely be homeless and destitute by now, couch surfing at a relative's house. \n\nYay overthinking!!! 😁... 😭",

            "text": "Last year I had my wedding in Puerto Rico. My husband and his family are from there. We planned it remotely, and we were set to have it at this hotel on the south side of the island because it’s been a vacation spot for their family for over 40 years, with 80 or so guests flying in from the contiguous US and from all over the island. \n\nMy husband and mom are very good at contracts, and my mom is a top-tier worrier, so they ensured to ask the hotel to add a clause to the contract called the “Acts of god” clause. This meant we were allowed to pull out of the contract if there were acts of god such as fires, natural disasters like hurricanes, etc. with a full refund. The hotel was hesitant and weirded out by the request since no one has ever asked them that, but eventually they obliged, even though it delayed the process a bit. \n\nWell, 2 months before the wedding, the exact town where the hotel was located suffered numerous devastating earthquakes. We’re talking houses fell off into the sea from the cliffside, people were living in relief tents, and the roads were closed so the hotel wasn’t even accessible. And these earthquakes kept happening every day for quite a few weeks. We didn’t even think about the fact that this whole town was located on an active tectonic plate! \n\nAnyway, the hotel tried to keep our money like the bandits they are, but we had my husband’s tía step in and negotiate with them and evoke the “acts of god” clause by threatening to set her lawyers on them. She is a businesswoman known around the Caribbean and used to own a bunch of real estate and businesses before she cashed out and retired at 50. \n\nAfter that convo, they gave us a full refund. It was crooked that they actually thought they could keep our money given that no one could literally get to the hotel as all the roads were blocked with debris, and given our contract. The true “act of god” ended up being tía to save the day!!! \n\nSo then, by some miracle, we were able to move the venue 5 weeks before the wedding to another resort closer to San Juan. We found an even better hotel, that just happened to not have a wedding event scheduled that weekend!!!! And trust me, there are not that many hotels on the island, so this was truly a crap shoot. So all 80 people had to move their hotel rooms and I had to ask all our vendors to relocate. \n\nIt was an absolute shit show but it ended up being fantastic. And in the end we got really lucky because our flight back was the first week of March 2020 when the pandemic hit in the US. So between being overly contractually prepared for earthquakes and a global pandemic, I got really lucky and married my dream man! ❤️",

When I was 8, I became sick. The hospital wouldn’t admit me because they said they were too full. My mom tried for MONTHS to get me in, taking notes the entire time on symptoms, who she talked to at the hospital, etc. *She did this even at the very beginning when I wasn’t that sick, just in case she would need the info later*. \n\nAfter almost a year of this, I became extremely sick and they still wouldn’t admit me. I finally got in because my mom laid out all the information she gathered and they realized we had reason to sue them because we hadn’t been admitted sooner. I got admitted into the ER and stayed in the babies ward because the ward I should have been in was still full. But at least I lived. \n\nI have life long complications from that incident that cause me a severe amount of mental and physical stress, and chances are I would be a lot better 20+ years later if I had gotten help sooner. It sucks to be anxious about my health all the time, but I’ve learned to advocate for myself and not trust doctors, and it’s helped me out many times in my adult life. I have a lot of undiagnosed or misdiagnosed issues that I’m having to treat myself on as best I can. \n\nGeneral Advice- always make note of the dates of your appointments, who you speak to when you call with questions, and do your research into medical issues. Definitely see doctors, I’m not saying doctors are a waste of time! But realize that they are people too and are fallible. Advocate for yourself!",

He had just installed come custom hard panniers (in common tongue, saddle bags or storage bags). He spent quite a decent amount on these hard bags. \n\nNow, I often ride with a full toolkit. Which includes a full 1/4 inch socket set (imperial or metric), tyre levers, adjustable wrenches, CO2 tyre inflation kit, manual tyre pump, electrical tape, silicon tape, WD-40, engine oil, magnet on a stick and the list goes on. \n\nMuch to the ridicule of others (including this mate), I carry around this kit everywhere. I've removed and reinstalled a wheel after a mishap on holiday, been able to assist with dodgy locks on old bikes and much more due to this fact.\n\nOn a very sunny day with perfect weather, we were riding along together, on our way to a stop so we could go our own ways. I was headed home, but he was headed to the city, so this was really the start of his trip.\n\nRiding along, I notice that his left pannier is wobbling precariously after he hits bumps. I motion him to pull over, and upon assessing the issue, it was found that the mounting bolts had come loose after some work at the dealership the previous day. \n\nMuch to my delight, at the cost of my mates pride. I present him with an array of perfect tools for the job. He got it fixed, had an excellent ride. And I had the satisfaction of knowing that it was worthwhile carrying this kit. \n\nA lot of words for a small story. \n\nTo think you're right in saying things like \"you don't need a full tool kit, etc.\" seems like the right thing to do...\n\nUntil you need anything from it... \n\nStay humble, \n\nRegards, Zkenn24",

His hood was an aftermarket hood with an air vent to let the engine release heat better, which naturally just gives the fire fresh air to breathe better. It took him nearly 5 minutes to put it out, because he couldn’t gain access to a hose and water.  So, he had to replace a bunch of components that were damaged. This made me overthink things and I was always afraid my car (same model, different year. Also heavily modified for racing.) would catch fire randomly driving down the road. So I started taking note of houses in the areas I would regularly drive that had hoses that were easily accessible without entering fences on their property. I was certain that my car was going to catch fire while driving down the road. \n\nFast forward a few years, and my engine had just been rebuilt, and it was my first full day with my car back. I had about 60 miles on it, and a mistake by the shop had left an old (unused) fuel line in the car, with fuel still in it. During some hard braking at a stop light, I noticed some smoke from under the hood. And I though “if my car is on fire, I’m not opening the hood to check. Because that’ll feed it. And I know this house around the corner here has a hose right off the driveway with easy access from the front with no fence. When I stopped, I popped the hood and a small flame shot up from the engine bay. And I quickly put it out before the damage was too bad. A sub-harness in the electrical system needed to be replaced, and the rest was cosmetic. \n\nTLDR; my paranoia of engine fires saved my car from burning to the ground during an engine fire.",

I could see in my rear view mirror that It changed red after I'm through the intersection. No biggie. I see his intention of pulling me over, so at the next block I immediately pull over and park up before he's even though the light and kill my engine.\n\nHe asked as he walks up why I blew the red light.

I still wonder what would of transpired if I didn't have it out on my dash.\n\n\nAnother convenient use was when I witnessed a car accident on the highway. Car was drifting into the shoulder in the right lane on a three lane highway. After a minute of following I realize there's going to be an accident and switch on my GoPro and no sooner I do this the car slowly drifts into the Jersey barrier on the right shoulder swiping the side of the car clipping the mirror. This likely woke the individual out of his opiate high he was flying in because he over corrected and ran straight into the tail of a truck next lane over on the left flipping it.\n\nI pull over(after dodging the mess of vehicle parts and various things that fell out of both vehicles) and grab the gopro and film the scene before people started moving debris.

Finally realized the whole city was gridlocked and we were literally fighting a pointless uphill battle. \n\nWe retreated to the warm for warmth and rest. Played frisbee in the hallway. Scavenged the junk thrown away from a renovating computer lab and took a super duper base-boosted speaker. Meanwhile other students either found shelter in the campus center, dorms or were stuck in traffic to leave the *parking deck* for half a night. \n\nTHree of us just shrugged and said we'll camp in the classroom while evereyone else slowly filtered out. Whipped out the emergency blankets. Pieces of utter **garbage**. I shivered the whole night thru sleeping face down on tables. Even twitching would make the metallic sheet ripple with noise, waking us up again and again. Morning rolls around, we all leave once the next class times start. After that I kept an actual blanket in my locker. Gave some of the remaining blankets to my comrades to memorialize our suffering lol. Never again",

            "text": "Oh, geez. Well, you know how 2020 was the shit year for everybody? Yeah. I'm no exception. \n\nSo, late 2019...things are going great. I have a beautiful girlfriend, she has a precious son and we are trying for another, inspired by my recent promotions and newfound financial security. We were looking at homes, shopping for schools, just living the dream. With one caveat. \n\nI'm an over thinker. And I have had problems with jealousy in the past. So every time it came up that I was feeling jealous with my new love interacting with and generally doing normal parenting stuff with her boy's biological father, I very firmly told myself \"How absolutely ludicrous. It could never happen, don't let this irrational thinking go on.\"\n\nSo I would bring it up during the times where it was really bothering me and I made sure to be clear in communicating that I didn't have a problem with him and her interacting, it was just a twinge of pain from past relationships that I had moved on from. She was very reassuring and understanding. \n\nAround this time, we became pregnant, and I was elated. She was not as enthusiastic, given that we hadn't found a place to live yet and I had recently purchased a Camaro thinking we'd have plenty of time to prepare. We confidently went to our first appointment and discovered we were, indeed, pregnant. \n\nChristmas comes around and my father received the gift of learning that he'd be a grandfather again, in about 8 months from then. It was around this time, the days after Christmas, I had to cope with a little twinge of jealousy. I told my girlfriend I was just a hit sad that she only got Christmas evening with me, but Christmas morning and new years with him. I expressed that I really wanted to spend new years with her and she pretty firmly shot me down, almost like she knew I was going to propose and didn't want me to. \n\nThe day before New Years she told me some horrible news. She was bleeding a bit and didn't feel \"right\" in her tummy. I asked her if I could take her to the doctor and she said no, just to watch her son while she went on her own. I figured that was acceptable. From 9 am until 7 pm I didn't hear anything from her, and it should have just been a short appointment, blood work at most. \n\nShe finally called me and said she was on her way over to pick up her son, that she was miscarrying, and that the doctor told her it was caused by our aggressive intercourse. So right off the bat, overthinking me is wondering about everything she just said. She's not crying, she's simply driving over to pick up her son. She arrives, and pretty much exactly that happens. Inside I was dying, on the verge of tears from the moment I saw her...until the moment she spoke the first words that gave me doubt. \"I told you we should have been more careful.\"\n\nThat...is not a sentence she had ever spoken to me concerning the health of our unborn baby. In fact, she was quite persistent and passionate. We hugged, kissed goodbye, and she left me alone with my thoughts to churn. The next day, without any provocation, on New Year's, she says she needs some space and time to process. By this point I have already over thought every scenario, and resigned to my room ready to deal with the anxiety and unknowingness that comes from \"I need space.\" I totally accepted her desire for space, but I didn't understand it. I came to know her as someone who needed a strong and confident partner to confide in, because she herself wants to he strong but isn't confident. We were such a strong team because she was fiery and passionate on the outside, but timid on the inside, and I was timid on the outside and fiery on the inside. \n\nOne of the things that continuously churned around in my mind for the first weeks of Jan. 2020 was her saying the doctor blamed her aggressive intercourse for her unborn baby dying...and that just stuck out to me as biologically improbable. Sure enough, after a quick search, it's exceedingly rare for any complications to arise from intercourse of any intensity. Aside from breaching the cervix and tesring it, which would be exceedingly painful for both parties, there's really not much damage you can do. \n\nSo, as every tragedy goes, she inevitably decided to leave me with \"I thought it was clear we were broken up. I'm going to stay single for a long time. My son is my first priority. You're a great guy.\"\n\nAnd I let it go. I've got too much experience in this life to flip out and lose emotional control anymore. But I let it go in the healthiest way I knew how. I gathered the last of her belongings, sent her a text \"Your stuff is here. In 1 month it will be abandoned and you may see me trying to sell it. I have time this weekend for you to pick it up if you wish.\"\n\nI didnt receive a response. 30 days later, in February, with thoughts still churning about whether she got an abortion, was I that horrible? Faked the miscarriage, did she cheat? Never got pregnant, is she psycho? I pushed that all to the back of my mind and began posting the items of clothing, shoes, make up, and apple watch she had left behind. The watch needed a charger but a trip to Walmart solved that. \n\nImmediately upon charging the device, it connected to my wifi and a string of texts between her and her ex popped up...so I read them and essentially learned that they were back together. No surprise there. I've been lied to so many times, I'm surprised when I find out I've been told the truth. \n\nWhat I saw when I scrolled down was a bit more surprising. An email from her doctor saying she's soon entering her second trimester with no complications, I even got to see the ultrasounds. \n\nI texted her and said \"Do you have a due date? I'd like my lawyer to have a timeframe for when we can start the process of establishing paternity.\" My lawyer advised me not to attempt communication again after that. She never responded. She skipped state, sold her car, lives in a big house with her now husband and two sons. \n\nA much less mature and stable version of me would have compiled this whole shit scenario into a few new criminal charges. Be aware, overthinkers, that your emotions will be your downfall if you let them. I have a chance to know who my son is and be a part of his life because of my emotional control. Had I went through this a few years prior, I likely would have snapped and lost any chance to know my son. Stability. Learn it. Know it. Practice every day.",

            "text": "It all began in the winter of 2018. My mother is aging and I’m always looking for ways to make life a little more comfortable and convenient for her. I decided to buy her a bidet toilet seat. She took a bad fall and broke her arm a few year prior and it was becoming more difficult to wipe after going to the bathroom. \n\nI head to Costco (large American warehouse store) buy the bidet and head home to install it as a surprise. Unfortunately, the bidet needs to be plugged in (it has a nightlight, heated seat, water heater, drying fan, and a remote control) and there was no electrical outlet within reach of the power cord. Instead of returning the fancy $300+ bidet and replacing it with a regular one that doesn’t require power, I decided to add an electrical outlet at a convenient location on the wall behind her toilet. \n\nWell, when you give a mouse a cookie… the only way to install an outlet at that location is to go through the wall to my bathroom on the other side of the wall. This required me to remove my bathroom mirror since I had to run wiring through the wall to my light switch. When I removed the mirror, the little metal strip that holds the mirror in place on the top of the backsplash got damaged. The backsplash was the same material as the countertop (ugly yellowish color which was apparently all the rage back in the 1970s when the house was built). So then I  decided I may as well replace the backsplash AND countertop. This turned into an entire bathroom remodel… \n\nI buy all the stuff I need, replacing the sink, faucet, water pipes, countertop, backsplash, and drywall. While I’m at Home Depot, I decide to buy additional electrical components to add an outlet to my bathroom as well. Since I already had the wall open, why not? I add the electrical components, install the new sink and countertops and repair the drywall. Thank goodness you can find out how to do all these projects on YouTube. \n\nThis entire project took me about a year to complete. So now it’s February of 2020 and my bathroom is looking pretty good, but I still needed to replace my toilet because it looked old and everything else was new. I head to Costco and buy a replacement toilet. Next to the toilets are the very same bidets and now they’re on sale. I decide to treat myself and buy another one for my bathroom. After all, I had a power source…\n\nAt the time, I had a full time job (and a life) so I didn’t get around to installing the bidet in my bathroom until the second week of March. \n\nNo less than a week later, it’s announced that we are going into Covid lockdown and there’s a run on toilet paper… I was due to buy my normal allotment, and I couldn’t find any anywhere. What were these savages thinking? Why toilet paper of all things? Since I couldn’t find toilet paper, I decided to buy a tremendous amount of alcohol. I figured that if the world as I knew it was coming to an end, I could barter alcohol for various goods (like toilet paper). Turns out I drank most of the booze over the last year. I digress. \n\nAnyhow, it all worked out for my household. The bidets are awesome. My bootyhole has never felt cleaner. I don’t even use toilet paper unless I’m in too much of a hurry to let the drying fan on the bidet work it’s magic. \n\nI had never used a bidet before because I’m an American and, well, ‘Murca! We drive big cars, shoot big guns, and if we choose to smear poop all over ourselves when we wipe, it’s our God given right!  I am a convert though and I highly recommend getting a bidet.

Saw the flash of headlights in my rear view, caught the dip of a vehicle slaying thier breaks too late. \n\nI gunned my van, cranked the wheel to the left and pressed back in to the seat, head contacting the head rest. I was able to point my vehicle away from the car I front of me before being struck by a VW Passat doing 60. \n\nThe impact picked up the rear end of my vehicle, spun me around, pushed me within 4 inches of oncoming traffic, ripped off the number entirely, ripped the bolts hoping the trailer hitch clean out, snapped the welds off my exhaust to the muffler, and compacted the passenger side by nearly an inch. I had zero injuries save for some slight wiplash and aggravating old injuries/operations.",

            "text": "\"Unlikely scenario\" is a relative term more appropriately applied to those who are considered optimists and idealists, who by virtue of being optimistic/idealistic are not overthinkers because it would impact on their utopian outlooks which are too painful to encompass or imagine.  On the other hand, realists such as myself, who often are understandably considered pessimists or fatalists by idealistic standards, are by nature prepared for \"unlikely scenarios\"  because we do not consider them unlikely, but rather real possibilities due to our general pragmatism which may be a result of what may be considered overthinking to others.  So, to answer the question posed here, there have been too many \"unlikely scenarios\" that have come true for me to list.  Suffice it to say I have earned the right to repeatedly exclaim, \"I told you so\", although, while I often think it, I more often refrain from stating it.  Neither characteristic on both ends of the spectrum (fatalism - idealism) should be considered an attribute IMO, but I will say that realists may be better prepared to accept the realities of life, with less tendency to suffer the same degree of shock and disappointment, although the idealist is often great at masking those feelings, assuming they can ever admit it to having them in the first place.",

The bank semi-frequently got robbed, and being the over-thinker that I am, I would run through scenarios in my head of what I would do if someone ever tried to rob us. We had a silent alarm, but it required a specific code number: 9, which you had to manually input, located in the office, but not by the cash register. The control panel for the alarm also had a code for the doorbell that rang every time someone entered or exited the shop.\n\nOne day this guy came in, who I had seen a few times before. I'm at the register and he walks up, pulls his shirt up to expose the handgun nestled in his waistband, and said, \"please give me the money in there,\" nodding to the register. My stomach dropped and I'm lost for a second, but then I calmly ask my co-worker behind me to enter code 9 to shut off the doorbell. This at least triggers the silent alarm while I open the register and hand him the few 20's, 10's and 5's in there. I did not lift up the cash drawer itself, so the rolls of change and a few hundreds and fifties and checks stayed safe in there. \nHe takes the money, says \"thank you, I'm sorry,\" and leaves. \n\nThe police show up a moment later, we filed a report and whatnot, but I don't think he was ever caught. I actually felt a little bad for the guy... He was so polite, and I could tell this was a last resort for him. I'm so glad it was me at the register and not other members of my crew, who may not have handled it well. It could've gone very badly for all of us. \n\nI still think of him sometimes and wonder what he needed the money for and if he's ok.

Finally at 21 I had pain in my side and thought “it’s finally happening”. Boyfriend drove me to the emergency room, showed them where it hurt in my side and they said “that’s not even where your appendix is”. I insisted they run an ultrasound then a CT where they find out “well shit your appendix isn’t where it should be, half your Bowels run vertically instead of horizontally and your appendix is slightly inflamed”. They took it out the next morning. \n\nSecondly while pregnant with my son, I gained 8 pounds in 2 weeks and then another 8 pounds by the next doctor visit. Doctor said “watch out for preeclampsia that weight gain is a lot” started obsessively checking my blood pressure with a home machine and found it was high multiple times. At next apt I told him I have had multiple high blood pressures when measuring at home and he said “I don’t put much stock in home machines, come into the hospital and have it measured sometime”. 😒 Anyway 36 hours before I was 37 weeks (which is when they induce when you have preeclampsia but without serious symptoms) I go in for pain in my side but it’s not the right side for a preeclampsia symptom. They take a urine sample and monitor my blood pressure for 3 hours (standard procedure). Urine comes back with high ratio of creatine(?) to something else (symptom of preeclampsia) and they get multiple high blood pressures in 3 hours. Confirming preeclampsia. Induce me at midnight on the day of 37 weeks. \n\nTL;DR I’ve been right twice knowing my body and what’s wrong and doctors have screwed me thinking they know better than me.",

But I was able to call a funeral home to claim his body and bring him home several states away within the hour, and handle all the arrangements necessary, because I had already thought through all the issues three years prior.",

My best friend and I were flying to Oregon together, but leaving from different states and meeting in Colorado for our connection. Her flight was delayed, and she was going to miss our connection, so I held myself back, rebooked our flights, and had clothes for us to wear for pjs that night in a hotel and was then wearing clean clothes the next morning. \n\nAnother time, I was getting ready to travel with my sister for a month in Europe, and for some reason, I was convinced I was going to need toilet paper during our travels, so I picked up some small to-go rolls from the travel section at Target. Never needed them that summer, but the next summer, I brought them with me again, when I was back in Europe. Went out one day with friends, and a girl goes to use the restroom and immediately comes out because there’s no TP. I hand her some out of my bag and everyone just looked at me, wonder wtf else I had in there. That summer I seemed to always have what someone was magically looking for; aspirin, bandaids, pens, etc. I’m hardly ever that prepared, but after the previous summer, it seemed easier to bring what I already owned from home, versus needing it and paying the higher prices while abroad.",

Most of our belongings and new baby stuff were in boxes in our bedroom, so our bedroom was off-limits. No work needed to be done in there anyways. It was otherwise empty in our two bedroom house.\n\nThe renovation was supposed to have been completed well before the baby arrived. As the weeks passed, it was more and more apparent that our General Contractor was never going to finish the renovation by the agreed upon date. With every delay that pushed the finish date to weeks after our baby was due, I got more and more worried. I wondered what was going to happen in the house while we were in the hospital having the baby. We never needed to worry about home security before.\n \nSomething just didn’t sit right, and I just kept getting a really bad feeling. So, I bought both wired and wireless security cameras to monitor the inside and outside of our home. Everybody said I was worrying over nothing. We didn’t have anything of value, so nobody is going to steal anything. I got a lot of shit, but I stood my ground. \n\nBefore I could get all the cameras set up though, I had a medical emergency and had to go to the hospital early to deliver the baby. I called my husband at work to tell him that it was time, and he asked me what I needed. I told him, “I need you to finish setting up those cameras.” He didn’t want to initially, but I was able to persuade him to spend the extra hour at home, so he could finish the setup.  When he arrived at the hospital, he showed me everything. I made sure the feed and notifications came through to my cellphone.\n\nA few days later, we’re still at the hospital but now we have a new addition to our family. I get a notification on my cell phone. Someone is in our bedroom. A solo sub-contractor is caught on video going through one of my drawers. I can’t leave the hospital because of obvious medical reasons. My husband can’t leave because pandemic rules are in place. (Once he leaves the ward, he is not allowed to return.) I emailed the video clip to the GC, with the message that I want the panty raider off my property. My husband sends the clip to his dad, who rushes over and makes sure the guy isn’t trying to abscond with my belongings. Police show up. The GC shows up. The guy denies even entering the room, until my FIL shows the video.\n\nApologies from everyone to us. But most importantly, I get the sweet sweet “you were right honey” from my husband to me, and proved to my in-laws that I wasn’t unreasonably paranoid. Best money I ever spent.\n\nTLDR: bought a home security system to monitor house while I was in hospital. It catches a guy going through my drawers looking for drawers.",

I call the first Frankenvirus, it is how a pandemic is accidentally started when viral research is done offshore to prevent the violation of laws that forbid this research in the US. In the first novel, the virus was believed to be stopped by a Russian Bioweapons team however it manages to escape and the next novel focuses on its evolution in China. I call the second novel Zoonosis because it shows how the virus undergoes further mutations in animals and is on the verge of creating a pandemic. The final novel I call Surge Capacity and shows how the pandemic sweeps the world and the insane measures countries use in an attempt to contain its spread. The novel is based upon actual historical events and research that occurred years before our current pandemic. I wrote my novel in the hopes of educating the public on what to expect and hopefully avoid panic when a real pandemic occurred. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a publisher because most considered the fact-based novel as too academic.\n\nhere is a very early draft of the first novel in case any doubt my claims: [https://www.wattpad.com/story/99444658-viral-some-things-are-best-left-dead](https://www.wattpad.com/story/99444658-viral-some-things-are-best-left-dead)I\n\nI used to be a molecular biologist and worked for a drug company on viruses and later I became an ICU nurse who specialized in infectious diseases and that is why I had this interest, I also am currently living off-grid in a remote mountain in Appalachia.

Of course naturally I thought I'd find him in the electronics. I was walking back and forth to look down each aisle, and when I turned to walk back an officer came around the corner and he stopped me dead in my tracks. He asked are you Kelly? I was SO embarrassed! Because of previous relationship issues I didn't know what to think. He had already bought some items, me some jewelry, a game, and other things, and was just looking around. He was High. He had smoked just before we went shopping. I don't partake because I get paranoid, but anyway, I looked at the items and being filled with adrenaline not knowing what was going on, I assumed he tried stealing all of that stuff. So we had bought 2 sets of curtains and they were velvety red, one of them I didn't pay attention to was a short CURTAIN and he saw they had re stocked. He took it out of the package to make sure to see if it was about the same length and texture. He didn't put it back in the package because he was trying to find me. He walked towards the door, AFTER he had already purchased some things and he was looking to see if I was coming in. He didn't even make it out of the store, a cocky ass \"mystery shopper\" whatever they're called snatched him up and told him you're coming with me. He had a whole RED long curtain hanging out of his back pocket, not even trying to conceal it, and they still called the police. After I started thinking about it,....\n1. IF perhaps he weren't high, he wouldn't have had a brain fart and would've been able to explain what was going on to ME and the officer. \n2. Had I been thinking clearly at the time, why would my 30 something year old boyfriend buy some things and then decide he was just going to STEAL A FRIGGIN CURTAIN. Not a pair, but one single CURTAIN!\n3. The hidden shopper was just having a boring day and I don't doubt he wanted to make something from nothing. \nTo this day it angers me that even the judge found a 30 year old male GUILTY of theft of a CURTAIN!!!!! \n4. I should've went to court with him, after the fact learning what happened he was just under the influence officer and had no intentions of stealing a CURTAIN. It burns my ass up, but WHY did I automatically think, \"What did he do?\" When I got back to the parking lot. \n5 Did I mention I'm still pissed it's on his record that he's a thief! OVER A CURTAIN! \nMuch more rare and unpredictable things have happened in my life, I have been the type of person for a while to over think everything. I live by Murphy's Law. If it can happen, it will happen..... 🤔",

I invested in 20 small rubber ones, which later that winter yet again came in handy during a whiteout where - yes - it was so windy the old ones would have blown away.

One day, my school was sent bomb threats and a ransom fee, (no i didn't gain cool powers and find all the bombs and beat the bad guys), but it turns out obviously there was no bomb at all. In fact, the threat was sent to around 125 schools total, and originally, it was because 3 guys were arguing in Minecraft or sole shit like that and he said he was going to blow up his school as a joke...

I returned to my seats the flight attendants looked really serious, far out I thought; something seemed heavy. Lunch was stopped/cancelled, trays returned upright and we all sat there pretty quiet in our seats I guess anticipating whatever was to come. It was funny because everything was so normal yet something really ‘abnormal perhaps’ was happening with our plane. I wasn’t really sure how much trouble our plane was in at the time. I was just calmly cruising in complete normality trying not to imagine our plane bursting into flames...\n\nEventually we landed without issues, upon landing engineers entered the plane  we were informed by the pilot that a leak had been confirmed and it would be repaired and then we were to head to Tokyo (in the same plane!), I was not keen but couldn’t pull out so yeah no choice. The pilot didn’t say another word til we reached Tokyo and on his announcement he seemed exhausted and apologised I can’t really remember the specifics....

            "text": "I know I'm really late to the game and this will probably get buried, and it's LONG BUT WORTH THE READ.  \nBut anyway when I was a senior in high school, we all only had flip phones, and it still wasn't at a phase that everyone had phones yet. But my brother, 21, and his best friend, 23, ALWAYS had their phones blowing up with calls. They partied a lot. I had also been dealing with a rare grand seizure disorder since I was a freshman in high school, and my parents had gotten me a cell phone really young for that reason. \n\nA little back story: Both of my older brothers, and 3 of their best friends, would check in with me multiple times a week when I was at school because they were used to me having a grand seizure at least once every 2 weeks, but they had started to happen once every 6-7 days, and no doctors had figured out how to stop them yet. So all 5 of those guys checked on me religiously, and the school administration had approved them to sign me out for the day if I felt even mildly tense or faint.\n\nSo, back to the overthinking. It was super common for people not to answer their cell phones in 2006. Not many people had them and they didn't ring that loud. One night my brother's best friend was going to meet his new girlfriend at the bar where she worked. Around 10pm he was supposed to meet at my parent's house with about 10 of us having a Blockbuster (heh) movie night. He was never late. Ever. NEVER. LATE. EVER. When midnight rolled around and he hadn't shown up, wasn't answering his cell, the bar phone kept ringing with no answer, I panicked. My entire family and friends were used to me being an anxious overthinker 24/7. I always assumed the worst case scenario. \n\nI demanded my brothers and I drive to the bar (I couldn't drive... because seizures). They said \"ok if he's not answering by 1am we'll go\". So 1am came and went, and we drove the 30 minutes to the bar. One mile away from the bar, we see headlights coming up from a ditch, and another car sitting on the road without any damage. We pulled over immediately. I just fucking knew. I knew it was him. But my brother said \"no he was going to call us when he left the bar\". But he'd never made it to the bar. \nThe couple who had been driving the car without any damage were screaming at each other and slurring their words horribly. They kept saying \"it was an accident\" to us over and over, and begging us not to call the cops. I immediately said to my brothers \"he's dead\". They still insisted I was overthinking and one of them grabbed a stick out of his car to try to balance himself down into this really deep ditch beside a lake. But I just fucking knew. I knew my overthinking was right. I had made my brother carry roadside emergency auto and medical kits. I the the medical kit down into the ditch for my brother. About 30 seconds later I heard my brother screaming and puking. I jumped down and opened up the hyperventilation bag. He pressed out. The bag had smelling salts and I woke him back up. I saw our friend and immediately started puking everywhere. \n\nOur best friend had gotten a flat tire one mile from the bar. He had his flashers on, and had set out a flare and 2 of those portable flashing emergency cones while he was changing his tire (I had also bought him the emergency auto and medical kits for Christmas, and he said I was crazy paranoid, but here he was using it in all the right ways to protect himself). The couple in the other car were extremely drunk, and had swerved and hit him at 60mph, and their reasons was so delayed that they fully ran him over after the cops said the impact of the hit had thrown him 1100 feet (they measured blood and flesh stains on the asphalt). \n\nThe drunk couple knew he was dead, so they rolled his car into the ditch and put his body back in his car to try to make it look like he crashed. They told us this. But most cell phones didn't have video capability back then so we couldn't record that confession. They bolted as soon as we called 911. However, I also made my brothers carry digital cameras in their cars, \"in case they needed to photograph a car accident for insurance\". They were able to get a decent enough zoomed photo of that couple's license plate as they drove away. \n\nIf I hadn't been \"overthinking\", my brothers and our friends would've chalked up his no-show to the movie night as just him going home with his girlfriend. We never would've had the license plate and verbal confession from that couple to take to court. Unfortunately they only got 4 months in jail and 6 months community service, which still makes my blood boil 15 years later, but at least I have the peace of KNOWING what truly happened versus having some unknown sketchy story.\n\nEdit: format",

The experience is still painful to think about but thankfully I’m able to drive on the road again without a panic attack!\n\nEdit: For context, if I was any later to work, I would have possibly been fired for leaving the store unattended while going outside on the clock (it’s a small convenience store).

Because of that, accidents often happen due to loss of control of the car or loss of brakes (lots of break use on the decline). Guard rails and other safety precautions are rarely available and maintained so staying on the road is paramount to survival.\n\nSince learning how to drive, one scenario I overthought about constantly was what I would do if my breaks ever failed me. I went so far as to research how breaks works, how friction works on tires, how the weight of the car impact break performance, etc...\n\nOne afternoon, in July a couple years ago, family come to visit. We have a great lunch at a beautiful restaurant that happens to be perched on top of a mountain. The road to, and from, the restaurant happens to be at a 30 to 35 degree incline (and decline). Due to the hight of the Mountain, there are a lot of twist and turns.\n\nThere were 9 of us at lunch, so we had rented 2 cars (both with automatic transmission) for the occasion. My uncle and myself were the designated drivers for the day. My uncle, who happens to be the family's speed demon leaves me behind pretty quickly. Since I knew the road, that was fine. On the way down, my breaks overheat and are temporarily disabled.\n\nI proceed to go down that Mountain, with full traffic, using the e-break (or hand break)! In some cases, the hand break doesn't engage well, so I proceed to force the moving car on Parking or Reverse to destabilize the engine. I'm controlling the car with enough stoic focus to tear the universe in half while every passenger in the car are screaming/praying/wailling! \n\nI make it to the foot of the mountain, park at a gas station and calmly call the other car to tell them what happened. Everyone else in my car are outside, kissing the ground. \n\nEver since that day, every older adult in my family bring up that story at a party or a dinner at least once! \n\nOverthinking for the win! 😤😤😤",

I had this kind of sneaking suspicion that she had a thing for him and didn’t really like me but our relationship was amicable and we never fought or had beef. Hubby would go to her for relationship advice but the advice was always more or less that we were probably not compatible. Whatever, okay, I understood what that meant but had no way of really proving anything and my hubby always kinda downplayed what she would say. \nSo I had a sneaking suspicion she was trying to nudge him into leaving me because she wanted to date him. I also never felt comfortable opening up to her about anything personal for fear that she would make it everyone else’s business or use it to manipulate me. Anywho, finally one day, it all came to a head when she found out we were spending more time with another friend. She issued an ultimatum and forced him to stop seeing the other friend and started guilting him about their relationship. She confessed her feelings for him and even got upset at him for never taking things further with her in the past. Some things went down and hubby and I took a two week break, during which, she kept trying to push a relationship he said he wasn’t ready for. She started telling people they were together and treating him like a partner and he eventually told her he wanted to work on things with me. She blew up and told anyone who would listen that he was a chauvinist and a user and that i was crazy and she felt like she was in danger. \n\nI had a sneaking suspicion that he was a little manipulative and had a crush on my partner but had no idea it would get so out of hand",

            "text": "Have you ever wanted to take a dump on your bosses desk? Well, my mother did just that. Here's the story.\n\nSo, I worked for a local newspaper company as a mid-level manager. I was basically in charge of being sure that all the actual newspaper carriers were doing their jobs right. The company basically expected me to be sure all the carriers had working vehicles, otherwise I would have to drive the routes myself. I knew at the time that one carrier who had 3 routes, totaling 250ish miles a day, had just had her truck repoed and would not be able to do her job without help. I asked around for a car to borrow with no luck. As a last resort, I talked my own mother into letting her borrow my now deceased dad's truck with the guarantee that my mother would be reimbursed by the company for whatever miles that the truck was driven. Originally, the carrier borrowing the truck was only supposed to need it for a work day or two. Well, after two weeks she was still using the truck. One day during that time my mother and I had a conversation where I said \"I bet money that my boss/the company will back out of guaranteeing the mileage reimbursement money and we will end up with nothing.\" Her response was something to the effect of \"they'll be hearing from me personally if they do.\" \n\nSure enough, 6 WEEKS into the carrier using the truck, I get called into the office and am told that the company can no longer guarantee any money for the use of the truck. Of course my mother was not happy. BUT my boss told me that he would personally be standing there when that carrier got her next paycheck and would have his hand out to get a personal check for the amount due at the time of over $1600. Payday came, and turns out he did not do what he said he would, and it would now be up to me to get our money.\n\nNow a little background on my mother. She recently had a Colostomy Surgery to repair whatever. Since then she's had to wear a colostomy bag, and will continue to have to wear one until her next surgery to reattach everything. \n\nSo anyway, after the 6 weeks, my boss tells me to give the carrier an ultimatum: get her shit together and find a car or we'll be taking my mothers truck back and she loses her job. My mother and I have several more conversations about what she would do if she doesn't get the money that's due. I also decided that if the carrier gets fired, then I would quit too because I wasn't willing to do three more routes on top of my original job.\n\nUltimatum Time comes and goes, (8 weeks total of the carrier having the truck later) the mileage bill ends up being OVER $2,100. We go and pick up the truck, and I had put in my two weeks notice. The last day I was working, my mother walks in the front door to the office as if she was a customer. I immediately knew shit was fixing to hit the fan. She walks right into my bosses office, closes the door, and proceeds to have an hour long chat about the lack of respect that my boss had treated me, and by extension my mother with. After a while, I get called into the office with the two of them and the boss tells us again why the company could not give us the money that was due. After which my mother ended the conversation with one last grand statement. She stood up, said \"Well, When you treat people like shit...\" She lifted up the side of her shirt, unscrewed the cap to the colostomy bag and dumped the contents directly onto the bosses desk, splattering everywhere, including on him, his keyboard, computer monitor, all the papers on his desk, and running over the edge between his legs. My mother then very calmly screwed the cap back on the bag, tucked it back under her shirt, and walked out the door. Both the boss and I were stunned speechless. After 10-15 seconds of awed silence, the smell hits us, and its BAD. The boss looks at me and says \"Clean this up\" to which I reply \"Nope, what goes around, comes around.\" and I left the building laughing hysterically as all the other employee's looked on in horror as the boss walked out of his office with a perfect line of splattered shit across his mid-chest.",

I was in this state of paranoia all the time because of this it honestly affected my everyday life. What I mean is I had basically been in a relationship for so long that getting out of one felt like I had just lost a life source I had been dependent on. Yeah I know it sucked. Anyways I was being really strict about who I spent my time with and making sure to give myself a lot more me time to take my mind off things.\n\nAnyways this guy (let’s call him Joey ) had been obviously flirtatious with me when I was in a relationship at the time, and now saw an opportunity to get with me (keep in mind I am a straight male). At first I didn’t really notice that his antics were pretty strange and handsy I just passed it off as him being “gay”. He also seemed to be much more forward than before.\n\nJust to elaborate I had already told him that I am not gay and that I had no feelings towards him whatsoever before I was in my relationship. So he has no excuse for his behavior. Anyways one day he invites me to come to the fair that had arrived in town with him and his “friends”. \n\nI figured that I had to get out of my house and touch some grass anyways so I agreed. But that didn’t change the fact that a little red flag went up inside my brain. That night when I was about to hit the hay I thought about the situation and began to actually take notes of the creepy and weird behavior he had been exuding all the sudden at the end of my last relationship. \n\nI got this nervous feeling in my gut like I was in a dangerous situation so I started thinking about solutions to every scenario whenever I was with him no matter how “out there” it was. One of those scenarios being a situation where he actually didn’t bring any friends to the fair. In which I concluded that I would have no other choice but to coldly turn around and never speak to him again.\n\nWhen I arrived on the day of the fair I met him there by the entrance and the first question out of my mouth was “where are you’re friends” to which Joey responded in the most (trying to play it off as a joke but can’t because I’m creepy)tone ever “oh I guess they didn’t want to come”.\n\nAnd just as I had practiced in my head, without missing a beat I turned around and never spoke to him again. To make matters worse when I left he didn’t say a single word, and I think it’s because he knew and that only cemented what I had thought about him. To this day I worry that he is still treating others with this same kind of behavior but I wouldn’t really know because he moved schools before senior year and I never saw him again.",

When I didn’t hear him snore, I went to my parents bedroom door and listened if he was breathing. \nI did that automatically for 8 years, until one unbelievably cold winter night I came home really late and the house was dark, empty (exept for my sister who just had gotten home from work and was quitely watching a TV show in the kitchen) and also very very cold as no one had made a fire that day to warm the house. I went straight upstairs and to my dads bedroom to hear him breathe, he wasn’t breathing.. I found him dead and kind of purple.. my mom was far out of town and it was just me and my sis and our huge cold house and our dads corpse..\nSince I had done this for almost a decade, I was kind of mentally prepared to find him dead one day, and it went EXACTLY as I always imagined. So I didn’t really have a chance to panic or go all hysterical, I had already thought of every possible scenario to happen from there on and we actually handeled it great. Our best friends got to us within minutes and made the following year of our life one of the best so far. So so much extended family who stayed around us and helped us maintain my childhood home, helping us with every single little thing we couldve thought about. \nHe was the best dad I could’ve imagined and I’m so happy I got to grow up while he was alive and giving us his absolute best. \nI don’t really remember it as a trauma, just an interesting life experience and I always imagined and still am sure of this, that it would’ve been a far bigger trauma for me if I had known that my mom wakes up next to him dead or something like that. It all worked out very calmly (exept for a crazy aunt, who wouldn’t borrow her car to my mom so she could come to us for the night because ‘she needed to go grocery shopping the next morning’)\nMy overthinking prepared me for this and I’m glad it went down the way it did.",
