He is a cult leader with nearly half the nation as loyal followers who are willing to believe anything he says despite how illogical and/or untrue it is.\n\nThe fact that he has so many followers isn't in itself what makes it scary, it's the fact that he is mentally unstable and uses that influence to cause chaos, racism, sexism, and hatred in general among other things, not to mention to weasel out of being convicted of crimes he has committed.  People are willing to die for him, believing that he is a hero for them, when really he cares nothing at all for them and won't be happy until people are referring to him as some sort of ultimate leader/master.

I'll start with the thing that still makes me shudder. In one class, I was assigned to write a paper, and I wrote it with pencil. I was in my algebra class and we had free time, so I decided to work on my paper, while I was writing, my homeroom teacher was in the class with me, and she snatched my paper then went out the door into the hallway, I chased after her to get it back, she was doing that thing you do when you tease a dog with something it wants, holding it above them, I tried jumping and reaching up to grab it, she raised it higher, so I pulled her arm down to grab it, she didn't like that and gave me In School Suspension. On the day of my suspension, which happened to be the day before my birthday. After 1st period, I was waking to my 2nd class, which was the one I had to write my paper in, and since it was close to my birthday, my teacher had made cupcakes for all of us (small class, like 9 kids). The vice principal stopped me and wanted me to come with him to the suspension room, I told about it being me birthday the next day and the teacher made cupcakes, he gave me 10 minutes, after 10 minutes, he comes into the classroom with the security guard for some reason, and we go to the suspension room. I started working on another assignment and look around the room and notice there are signs posted all around the room that say \"NO TALKING\" in all caps. As I was working, my pencil broke and I didn't have another one, and since there were those signs, I couldn't ask for another, so I just sat there, the suspension lady yelled at me why I wasn't writing, I said my pencil broke, she scolded me and asked why I just sat there, I pointed at the \"No Talking\" sign on the wall. A few minutes later, the bell rang for lunch and I got up, the lady scolded me again and said that suspension lunch isn't until next period., I sat back down, frustrated. Then the kids that had lunch detention come in and I'm sitting there and am really hungry. My feet start sweating so I take off my shoes and the suspension lady calls the security guard for... taking off my shoes. Yeah this actually happened. Then a series of escalating events happen... and the rest of the story is too personal.\n\nHowever, there is more...\n\nAfter this mess escalated, the school decided to send me home, my brother came to pick me up, after we got home, my parents asked me what happened, I was still in shock and couldn't tell them because I didn't want to relive it. after I calmed down a little, I told them some parts of the story, and they could not believe what they were hearing. A few days later, my dad was on the phone with the principal, and he ask if he could get an incident report, and the principal literally said \"I don't feel comfortable giving it to you\" he really said that. So then he says on another call he will give it to us after thanksgiving.   \nAfter thanksgiving, my dad was on the phone with him again and, the principal said that he got the report on the day my suspension was, which was over a month ago....  More personal parts of the story\n\nAnd about the personal parts of the story, that's the traumatizing part. I don't tell this story often because of that.",

            "text": "Not the scariest but one of the last I found out.\n\nA guy, my friend, who owns a hotel in an EU country, once got an email. Email as a response to the hotel job ad online. The email came from a girl in Iraq. She and her two brothers were serving a US military base.\n\nThe guy exchanged some emails and decided he will go there and pull these siblings out. He hired a lawyer and flew there. The US marines apparently were abusing them, these siblings were hired to clean up their mess hall, beds, everything. They were paid 200-250USD/month. They were given a container to live in which they had to rent (from same military) for 50usd/month. When my guy entered the container, he had the impression it was hotter than a sauna - no a/c, bare minimum. Around the base occasionally they had bombing alarms (excuse me if I don't know the proper name), the marines would retreat to the bunker - the underpaid siblings? Had to go to their container - essentially a casualty waiting to happen. So the guy, tells the sarge he wants to pull them out. Sarge says at best, one guy. He says - no, all of them - meanwhile lawyer is taking care of visas and documents. The sarge was such a piece of shit, that he sent marines to the hotel in Iraq my friend was staying at to intimidate him - pushed him for a fight. He stood his ground, they didn't do anything too bad (tbf, it would be a major incident to beat up a EU/NATO ally citizen). A day later, lawyer had taken care of documents and they all flew away to the EU country where my friend has given all three of them a job at his hotel and a house to live without rent. The siblings apparently couldn't believe it was all for free for them.\n\nBut what's really scary in this story is that these marines - who abused locals, who were bullying an ally, who would underpay locals despite being funded in millions, who would sacrifice a life of a local out of sheer discrimination - will be touted by American culture as heroes. My friend is a hero - these American soldiers are scum.",

Poles with the American flag, blinding chemical bear spray, steel pipes, fire extinguishers, battering rams and countless other deadly weapons.\n\nBut this true story gets worse.\n\nIn a horrifying and unbelievable turn of events that followed his failed coup attempt, he has instilled such fear into almost every member of the House and Senate from his political party and even a few spineless members of the Democratic Party, that they don’t dare stand up for the nation and constitution they were sworn to protect and defend by denouncing his treason, on the contrary, they all line up with him to strengthen his big lie that the election was stolen.\n\nThe state legislatures where his party is in control begin enacting state laws that will prevent Democratic voters from casting ballots in future elections   so this horrible man can not be defeated when he runs again in 2024 as well as enacting laws that will allow the members of his party to reverse election results if somehow Democrats still manage to cast enough votes to defeat him again, which will mark the end of democracy in America and will install a dictator to rule over us all.\n\nIn the months and years that will follow the total collapse of the United States of America the brutal dictator’s murderous rage causes fear and horror in every home in the country as he has all those his sick mind imagined are his enemies, such as  all former political opponents, members of the press for reporting the truth about his lies, his criminal and treasonous actions.\nNow even his most diehard supporters who believed all his lies are shocked when his police and military units nationwide go home to home to confiscate every firearm owned by every American to protect himself as all dictators do to prevent an uprising of the people when they all finally realize the horrible mistake the millions of his followers made by turning our once great nation from the most powerful and most free country ever seen in human history, into another nation of oppressed people now struggling just to stay alive and find food after the complete collapse of the economy that was the envy of the world that will never again function at a level high enough to even produce enough food, water and electricity to sustain any resemblance of a functioning society while the millions enslaved by the dictator are taken to slave camps where they build a Great Wall to keep out their dictator’s delusional imaginary foreign enemies and to keep in the tens of millions of Americans trying to escape from the most brutal dictatorship the world has ever seen.\n\nAnd, that’s how the true story of the death of the greatest nation ever created comes to an end which in fewer than 100 years will bring about the complete extinction of human life on earth caused by the American dictator’s orders to increase use of fossil fuels worldwide followed by is use of nuclear weapons destroying European nations who were America’s strongest allies.\nThe dark cloud of toxic smoke and radioactive dust that blankets the Earth following the burning of the last of the world’s rainforest that ends the planet’s ability to create breathable air, leaves the planet stewing in the stench of the billions of dead and decaying humans and trillions of animals who suffer the same fate as the creature that called itself “man” caused,  while claiming to be the most intelligent creature to ever life on the beautiful planet he destroyed because they were too ignorant to see the lie of just one seemingly insignificant criminal conman named Donald Trump who’s greed and stupidity destroys a nation of free but vastly under educated people who set into motion the final blow to the paradise they called Earth.",

The screen would turn just orange and purple and the person how was the voice of Nickelodeon. Would just say your going to die or someone a long those lines now I have a very vague memory of this. But there’s one thing i remember perfectly I was crawling on the floor towards the door to open it when something behind me pulled me really hard. Like so hard I was dragged across the room at the time like couple minutes the incident I was sleeping and woke up. Everyone else was downstairs cooking breakfast so no one saw this so going back to the main part. I remember crying at the door and my mom came up stairs and I guess that I just had a bad dream because I told her about it witch makes sense honestly. But the reason I knew it wasn’t a dream was because i felt the rug burn after it happened and nothing was behind me so something was off. The other thing that happened was I remember a ghost or spirit coming from the tv mind you this was the same house the other thing happened the spirit would I’m going to kill you or your family members. I remember the spirit was a female jogger I know I know sounds very weird but these things always happened at the same house. Once I moved it all stopped I haven’t experienced something paranormal since living there so it can’t be like a mental thing. I heard often times kids can see spirits more often then adults",

(My Mum and Aunties all used to joke that in the holidays their homes turned into regular old doss-house.\n\n\nApart from my five Cousins and I, my friend J was there, he too was at our flat every weekend, and his parents knew he would be OK. Mum had the reputation for being cool yet very strict.\n\n\nWe all hung out together, had a sandwich and drink and played on the Sega; then Mum and my Uncle's partner said we should all go for a walk, everyone thought it was a great idea so the ten of us set out\n\n\nThe three adults decided that we should go to Donkey Woods which is a bit of green wild land owned by the Council much like heathland.\n\n\nAs kids we used to go over a lot in the Spring, Summer and Autumn on our own or with family and it was reasonably safe and kid-friendly and it still felt wild enough to make you feel adventurous and not in West London.\n\n\nWe all walked the half-mile down the road from the flats to Donkey Woods, where we walked along the river until we got further into the Woods and while Mum, my Uncle and his Partner all sat down to have a cigarette, us seven kids went exploring.\n\n\nAs I've mentioned before, we all knew Donkey Woods really well and were totally at ease and comfortable over there so we weren't expecting anything unusual or \"creepy\" at all, for us, it was just another mid-August late Saturday afternoon and we were just messing around.\n\n\nMy Cousin T, my friend J and I were all talking and suddenly the other four kids came running up (they hadn't been too far away, just slightly further down the river. They were all out of breath and looked a little rattled.\n\n\nThe four of them told us that they had seen something weird in one of the small clearings; they wouldn't tell us, just said.\n\"You have to come and see!\"\n\n\nWe all thought it was just a major wind up, but when we got to the clearing our mood changed quickly not to fear, more like a sense of unsettling apprehension.\n\n\nIn the middle of the clearing, were three small tents in a rough triangle and in the middle of the tents was a small still smouldering fire and around the edges of the clearing were several small dead birds (sparrows) I think. \n\n\nThe whole scene was very unnatural and eerie and I felt a distinct drop in the temperature, most likely my imagination, but still quite evident. \n\n\nNow, the rough sleepers of the area did use Donkey Woods as a base, but not in that particular place of the Woods, as it was too close to the main road and the homeless people avoided harassment and abuse from certain unpleasant individuals by going further into the Woods to prevent any kind of confrontation \n\n\nThe homeless people who lived over Donkey Woods also didn't use tents; they would make a shelter from pieces of wood and plastic sheeting, and Donkey Woods isn't a place where people go camping recreationally, so we felt there was something very strange about the scene in this clearing.\n\n \nI told the four younger ones to go and get the adults; while they were gone, me, J and T didn't move, T who was and still is, as tough as nails, was completely colourless, you couldn't see her freckles at all, I didn't even move my wheelchair around the area as I normally would have done, and  J just kept saying. \n\"What the actual f--k?!\" \n\n\nWhen the adults came back with the other kids, they were clearly unnerved by the odd scene as much as we were, and it was soon agreed by everyone that we should leave the clearing and Donkey Woods immediately. \n\n\nThe most creepy part of this incident was the next morning my Uncle went to see my other Uncle and together they went over Donkey Woods to look around more; they went to the clearing, but there was nothing there, not even marks in the ground from the tent poles, no sign of the fire and no tiny dead birds. ",

As a forewarning, the following information is very unsettling and will explain why Carter never “kept his promise” of revealing classified UFO information to the public.\n\nAccording to the story that was corroborated by more than one witness, U.S. presidents are only given a cursory overview of the subject. Apparently, the CIA runs the program, only provide information to the President on a need to know basis, and do not consider presidential curiosity as sufficient need to know. This was implemented after Kennedy, and all presidents after him have been given only summary briefings (some presidents for unknown reasons were given more than others).\n\nOkay on to your question. President Carter is a deeply religious man who had also witnessed a UFO with 6 other people. Everyone thought that he would be the one to finally release UFO info to the public but as the story goes, he was repeatedly stonewalled. Eventually, the CIA had “the talk” with him, and afterward it was reported that he sunk his head in his hands and not only began to deeply sob, but was visibly disturbed for some weeks afterward.\n\nWhat was he told and shown?\n\nHe was told that the major religions including Christianity were programs created by extraterrestrials to prevent us from destroying ourselves while they ran their experiments on us – and that they made us. At this moment it became clear to Carter that such information could cause tremendous economic and social upheaval",

So im completely alone walkin back to the house and when u walk thru the side door u see the washer dryer then the living room and the closet I was cleaning. So every1 is cleaning the rooms they were told and I get back to the closet and the shelf I just cleaned had the ouija board on it, I was so confused I was like ok funny trick who put it back and I went and asked every1 in the house who did it? Every1 said they had no idea wat I was talkin about so I was like ok maybe I day dreamed takin it to the garbage or somethin so I went back to the closet and took the board and I put it in 1 of those black trash bags and then walked it back outside and into the dumpster and heard it thunk again, this time I got on this rick next to the dumpster and looked inside and there it was so I got down and walked back into the house and to the closet and there again its on the shelf and no bag in sight I was like what the heck so I ran outside and looked in the dumpster and it was empty not even the black bag. So I go back to the house and look in the closet again and its sitting on the shelf still, so I go to the hallway where each person is in a room and I ask every1 ok?¿! Who did it? Its not funny anymore they all were puzzled and was like what r u talking about I said this is the second time I took it to the trash and its back on the shelf then almost at the same time everyone said wat? I was like, you know that stupid ouija board! And my friends dad said in a serious voice \"no one did that! Every1 is working on there jobs so go finish your job\" I said I am tryin but everytime I throw the thing away when I come back its back on the shelf! Then I asked \"you promise u guys r not messing with me?\" He said \"NO\" \" we have to much to do, we don't have time to pull pranks we have to be out of the house today\" \"stop screwing around and get ur job done and more to your next job\" so I was like then come and see if u dont believe me so my 2 friends they were sisters and their parents came out to the front room and watched me take the box off the closet shelf and then we all saw the shelf empty and then they watched me walk to the dumpster and throw it away. After I tossed it I said ok u see its in the dumpster right then the mom said \"u r just wasting time\" I was like no please watch so every1 is right outside the side door and im by the dumpster so I run to them and in the door to the closet and I freeze because its on the shelf again and then my 1 friend was like wat? Wats wrong and then they all walked up 1 by 1 and saw it was back on the shelf and I was like see!!! They were all stunned so the dad said \"leave it there for now and move to your next job\" so I moved to the laundry area and cleaned it all up and boxed the stuff and then it was all clean and I went to the room to ask what I can do next and then I hear my friends mom scream so we all run to the room she is in and she says \"that shelf was just empty and when I turned around the ouija board was right there, who did it\" \"(my name) we told u to leave it in the closet\" I said \"I didn't do it I was in the other room with the dad\" he was like ya every 1 was with me. And wat was weird was it was on the laundry shelf I just cleaned. So the dad grabbed it and we followed him and there was a busy road in front of the house and he threw it in the road we all watched car after car drive over it breaking it and so we turned to go back inside, I of course kept looking back watching it and when each of us were back in the house so was the board I went back out the door and the road was empty as if it was never there. The dad opened the box to see if it was broke nope it was completely fine. So then the dad was like \"let's finish and leave\" so we got everything done and before we left the dad took the box and made sure everything was inside the box and we went outside and they had this fire pit thing and he broke the thing in half and lit it on fire. We watched it burn for a while it was more then half burnt when he was like \"ok lets go\" I asked \"r u sure we got everything from the house\" he says \"NO 1 is goin back into that house!\" So we just go in the car and drove off, my friends and I looked back as we drove and watched the flames on the burnt box. We all were like \"finally! That was so weird!\" So we get to the new house and again we all have jobs of takin boxes to the rooms written on the boxes and so my friends and I each grab a box and I take 1 box and I go to the closet as they go to other rooms in the house and the parents r outside sorting stuff and there on the shelf is the oujia board! I dropped the box screaming and ran outside where every1 was, they were like wat happened i was cryin and was like \"ITS THERE, ITS HERE\" they were like what and the parents ran inside and they saw the closet open and there on the self just like I said was the oujia board we were all scared but the parents were like ok I guess it wants us to keep it so the dad moved it to the garage. My friends and I was freaking out none of us wanted to go back in the house so we stayed outside and then they could tell I was so scared the dad was like \"ok lets stop we can finish later, let's go get some food\" so we left to get food and then they took me home it was 1 of the weirdest things I have ever experienced I still can't explain it to this day and im in my 30s. There was always weird creepy stuff that happened in every house the parents lived in.\nSorry my grammar is messed up to any1 that noticed lol",

            "text": "I don't know about \"the scariest\" story, but I have a few:\n\nWe have a family friend who was on a flight from Dulles that got delayed. They sat on the tarmac for over an hour with the Captain only giving vague bits of information about the delay. He finally came over the loud speaker and his voice was all shaky and he said there'd been some accident, all flights were grounded and they'd be returning to the gate. The second the doors opened on the plane, four sketchy Muslims who had been sitting a few rows in front of him *bolted* off the plane and disappeared. It was 9/11 and as far as I know, they never caught the three guys. When he told us the story months later, he still looked terrified.\n\nThere was an apartment building near the house where I grew up that had garden apartments that faced outward. One of my friends lived in one of those apartments for a few years and when she moved away we didn't really know who moved in after them, but from afar the guys there were swarthy and smoked a lot. They always said hi to their neighbors, but otherwise kept to themselves. Well, my mom had a friend living in the same complex who had recently married a complete loser sketchball. As it turned out, the guy had completely lied about a ton of stuff including his name and there was an arrest warrant out for him. The cops got the apartment number wrong and instead of going to *his* apartment, they ended up busting down the door to the apartment where the swarthy guys lived. They said there was like no furniture at all, even though the guys had been there for quite a while at that point, but they found bed rolls, empty takeout containers and pizza boxes, a bunch of fake IDs, and maps with various routes mapped out leading to the local airport, train station, etc. The police realized they had accidentally encountered a terrorist cell and backed out and contacted the FBI. The FBI told them to get out of there and not spook the guys, and then they went and set up a steak out. They ended up apprehending the guys. I have no clue what their plans had been, but it couldn't have been good. This was post-9/11 since my friend moved in like 2002, but it must have been like a \"let's try that again\" type of thing. Oh, and also, the police ended up getting my mom's friend's sketchball loser husband. I think he was in prison for like 5 years or something. I just remember I went to go babysit for her kids one night and he \"offered\" to walk me down the street (literally half a block) and kept making the most uncomfortable comments. I was like maybe 13 at the time. So icky.\n\nThere was also this other family we were super close with and the husband always gave me like \"wayyyy too happy vibes\". They moved out of the country for a few years with their like 4 kids and then moved back to our community. Well, at some point we became aware that something was wrong with the husband and he'd become kind of abusive. Things got to a real head when he pulled a gun on his wife and kids, so when he left the house, my mom had the wife and kids come over for safety. They were with us for several hours before we found them a 3rd party safe home, but the husband knew they'd come to us and we were just terrified for hours that he'd show up with a gun. We were ready to call 9-1-1 at the first sight of him, but those things can escalate so quickly. Sadly, she went back to him not long after, and they remained married for like another 2 years before she divorced him. I think she has full custody but he still has visitation. Thank God none of the kids were harmed physically.\n\nAnd then for a non-personal story, I haven't seen it mentioned here but there's a bazillion comments. Has anyone mentioned [Delphine LaLaurie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphine_LaLaurie)? I mean... just whoa.",

There were many rumors saying that this lady was a witch, and my great grandma was known to associate with witches as well. \n\nAfter arriving at the ladies house and dropping off the package he turned around to head home but half way through his journey back in the woods it started to get dark. As he’s walking, a huge owl starts flying by him and then eventually at him. It starts crashing into him over and over again. So he pulls out his machete and slashes it next time it comes over him and he hears it fall and land on the ground so he feels he got it and continues on his journey. Next morning his mom tells him he forgot part of the package he was supposed to take to the lady so he has to go again. So he says fine and makes the half day trip again. Once he arrives at the ladies house she opens the door and is missing an arm! So he drops the package and sprints home!",

            "text": "I grew up in the east coast region of India and have spent a rather easy-going life throughout. After high school graduation, during my bachelor's degree, I met this girl who shared the same interests as me. We eventually bonded and would take long, unplanned trips in and around the city, enjoying the surroundings and talking endlessly about our interests. One evening we planned to go to the cinemas and then look for a house to move into. We decided on watching “Annabelle” and bought tickets for the next show. While waiting for the show, we noticed that it started drizzling, which seemed a little weird, given that we were halfway through December, a month which hasn’t seen rain in decades. It was almost time for the movie to start, so the thoughts of the non-seasonal rain took a backseat and we went ahead to get ourselves snacks. The movie, obviously filled with jumpscares, gave us chills. Once the movie was over, we proceeded to leave. While leaving we saw this man covered in all black, drenched in the rain, standing a few blocks away from my car and it looked as if he was waiting for us to arrive, but when he saw us, he left hastily and didn’t even look back. Although it didn’t mean much, having just watched a horror movie, everything was suspicious. I was not able to see his face, but he looked like a well-built man. I was scared and I was with my friend, who I didn’t want to get into any trouble with, so we left as soon as we could, without any second thoughts.\nWe decided to go to the remote location on the other side of the city since the property was comparatively cheaper. We went through a few houses here and there and finally found one which was to our liking. The apartment we visited looked a lot like the one in the movie we just saw and were laughing and making jokes about it. It was almost sunset when we decided to head back. We sat back in the car, the GPS started acting up guessing that the signal was weak in that area, we had to rely on our memory to head home. My friend suggested going back via the shorter way since she had a curfew. Although it was a shorter route, it was deserted. It was not very well lit, so we had to drive a bit slower than usual. On the way, my friend was telling me a story about her friend who went to this place called the Bhangarh fort which is a remote fort in Rajasthan, famous for its paranormal activities. She said that her friend, while she was visiting the fort, felt unusually cold while she was inside the fort. The guide who took the people there was experienced and said a lot of things about the fort but the most notable mention was about when the fort was under attack and the king and his forces were being brutally massacred, the queen decided to ask the priest of the fort to help her bind the souls of her fallen army to the fort so that even though the fort was acquired the souls will never let a person in peace as her last act as the queen. The scarier part of this story was that her friend also saw the engravings on the walls which depicted the same which was made 500 years ago. While listening to this story, I was already scared to my shins but I still kept driving. My friend loves to tease me and she friskily said “What if I were to shout Bhangarh right now and something happened” and the moment she said Bhangarh the street lamps on the side suddenly turned off. Not only did the electric poles turn off but the headlight on my car also turned off. We sat there for a while, completely frozen, pondering upon what we should do since the entire road looked pitch black.\nI decided to stop the car and wait for some other car to pass by so we could at least have some vision of the road. We waited for about 10 mins and I was repeatedly trying to turn the headlights on but it was all in vain when suddenly I saw a car tailing us so I flashed the emergency lights and decided to move out of my car to flash my torch, which I later as I would understand, would be a fatal mistake on my part. The car suddenly stopped and I saw a man coming out of it, he started to approach me and when he was about near the car I noticed that he’s the same man, the one  I saw standing near my car after the movie. I instinctively flashed my torch on his face and abruptly shouted, “I saw you back in the theatre, I know who you are”. The man was taken aback and he stood still for a moment. Even though the man was standing right there, I couldn’t get a good look at his face because of his car’s headlights flashing my eyes. The man cautiously approached me and said, “I bear you no harm, I know you are weary of me so I’ll keep my distance”. I looked inside my car and I took a glance at my friend. She had turned pale and was shaken to her boots. I have been with her for over a year now and I had never seen such a look on her face but I thought it was because of the bizarre circumstance we were in right now. I whispered to her through the slightly opened window saying, “Don’t worry nothing will happen to us, this man will help us” as I pointed towards the man. She looked up at me with a petrified look and tried to say something but was too scared to utter a single word. I told her, “Everything will be alright” and hoped for it to be true. The man then took a look at the engine while staying a bit away from him since he realised I had not let my guard down and then told me to press the red switch on, near the engine to help me bypass the battery. I did as I was told to and like a miracle, the lights turned on. I moved out of my car to thank him but he was already walking back to his car and I shouted back, “Thank you, sir, for your help”. As I went inside my car, suddenly the street lamps came back on and I was elated. \nWhen I sat back in the car my friend grabbed my arm as tightly as she could and stared me dead in the eyes and asked me, “Who were you talking to?”. “A man who was riding behind us came to help me out.” “There is no one riding behind us nor did I see you talking to anyone, I just saw you talking to yourself and then you proceeded to fix the car”. I didn’t know how to react, I thought she was scared, hence such a reaction. I looked back, pointing my hand to the direction where the car was and said, ‘Look the car is just behi--” Something shifted in me, as I realized that there was no sight of a car whatsoever. Without skipping a beat and a moment, I revived my engine and drove as fast and calmly as possible. We both drove back in utter silence and after I dropped her back at her place, she grabbed my arm and said, “Call me once you reach safely” to which I nodded in fright. Scared but assured that she will now be safe. \n\nIt has been about 3 years since that incident but to this day, the incident haunts us every single time we think about it.\n\nP.s. I wrote this for Corpse Husband's real life horror story special and Yes. This actually happened.",

I pull up to the window and he asks “May I take your order?”, to which I replied “Yes I’d like a 10pc McNugget please”. What happened next was one of the most horrifying things I’ve ever heard a man say in my life. Over the speaker, he grumbled: “we’re all out”. “Out?” I thought, slowly having the realization creep upon me. A panic began to be encompass me. I felt the most real feeling of terror take over my body. I had to get out of there, so I hit my foot on the gas and got home as soon as I could, barely recovering from the shock.

I suggest you either read the wiki or listen to Aaron Manke's podcast on it, since his Dreadful Places book is where I learned about it.\n\nMultiple ships got a strange transmission in Morse code. \"We float, all officers, including the captain, are dead, lying in the chartroom and and bridge. Possible whole crew dead\"\n\nThey sent rescue ships. Before they arrived, they received one last transmission, this time a voice over the radio: \"I die\".\n\nThe Silver Star was the first one to arrive. They tried to signal the Ourang Medan with whistles and lights to no avail. A small team boarded.\n\nThey heard music as they walked down to hall, giving them hope, only to find all of the crew lifeless, still seated at their stations. The communications operator, most likely the source of their transmissions, was still at his console, hands at the dials with a strange grin. Something was wrong.\n\nThey searched the cargo deck to find something even stranger: all the corpses seemed to be frozen in place, arms outstretched, faces pointed at the sky. Each body was the same: Mouth gaping wide, as if in horror at some invisible thing. There were no survivors, but none of the bodies were visibly injured. No matter where they looked, there seem to be no logical explanation. One man even found a dog standing up. He thought it was alive, but soon found it too was frozen and dead. It's head was turned up, lips pulled in a snarl, eyes locked on nothing but air.\n\nEventually, some of the rescuers found a fire that seemed to have broken out minutes before. They all evacuated, and within minutes, the fire caused to ship to explode, taking it's secrets with it. Nobody even knows what cargo it was carrying.\n\nIt's likely the crew died to some kind of gas, but that doesn't help to explain how they froze like that.

Stupidly, we pulled out a Ouija board. You might think it moved, but actually, the planchette never moved on the board. We shrugged, figured the house was solid, and went on with our lives. \n\nImmediately after, weird sounds filled the house. We’d been there for a few hours by that point, ao there shouldn’t have been these noises. It was very sudden- doors opening and closing slowly, footsteps, creaking floorboards, the wooden blinds to the windows swinging shut despite being closed. My sister was freaking out- about 7 years old- and my solution (15 maybe at the time) was to pretend it wasn’t happening, lmao. I popped a game called Ys into my PSP and went into its jukebox mode and played music as loud as I could to try to drown out the house sounds. When the doors to the living room kept swinging open, I propped a chair up and loudly proclaimed, “House must be settling!” \n\nMy sister eventually begged me to escort her to the nearest bathroom in my future parents’ room. When we tried to turn on the lights in there, they wouldn’t. My sister goes to the bathroom, light turns on. She leaves the door cracked. This room was odd, it had a conjoining door to what would be my bedroom, a sliding door that at that time was open. I heard slow footsteps walking toward us quietly through what would be my room. \n\nThe light turns off in my sister’s bathroom. She panics. I hear breathing in the eerily blackness of the room that will be mine. I reach forward and slowly slide the door shut, cutting it off. My sister is asking me “What? Did you see something? Do you hear something?” To which i just go “Nah. Just wanted to close it.”\n\nEventually we gave in and called my parents to come sleep at the house too, and the activity momentarily stopped... sort of. Afterward, my parents started noticing things- we hadn’t told them ANYTHING. I watched my mom, standing on a step ladder, suddenly tilt off of it. Lights wouldn’t turn on, and the electrician couldn’t figure out why. My dad nearly fell off the roof when his ladder was knocked out from under him. My mom started wondering aloud if the place was haunted. \n\nLike any stupid 15 year old who knows only horror movie solutions, I went online. About 23 forum searches later, a forum told me that sometimes, spirits are angry because you don’t know who they are. I didn’t know how to figure that out, so I took my sister one day, we stood in front of a fireplace, and i said, “I’m sorry we woke you up and I’m sorry we don’t know who you are, but until I get a better solution, we can grant you the name Beethoven.”\n\nImmediately, things got better. Things that hd gone missing turned up; the lights worked. My sister and I still hadn’t really told my mom what we’d done. \n\nOne day, my mom comes home and tells me that the neighbor had told her something interesting. The man who’d lived in the house before us was a widower- and a MASSIVE dick. Roughly a year prior to all of this, this neighbor learned from his then-living wife that she’d discovered he was cheating on her with her best friend. They had three kids. Devastated, she tried to see if she could rekindle the marriage by getting pregnant. The pregnancy took- the marriage did not. 9 months later, give or take- and I always seem to get this part wrong, I believe this is right- she’s driving when she suddenly goes into labor- water breaks and everything. Or it’s that she was already in labor and a contraction hit her- I always forget. In shock, she smashes her car into a nearby post. \n\nNeither she nor the baby make it. \n\nShortly after, husband moves out and in with her beat friend, his mistress. We move in, and I now realize that Beethoven is likely this poor woman’s spirit. \n\nA lot more follows this that is very hinky, including a stupid second usage of the Ouija board during HALLOWEEN because i’m DUMB, but eventually, she got really quiet in the house, and somehow we... forgot about her. We eventually moved out and didn’t even think about it. A few days after, our old neighbor excitedly sends us a photo she took of the new house owners with a priest that they’d called, walking into the home. \n\nI have never touched a ouija board since. Ever since that second time, I feel like something sees me.",

I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up... bobbed up and down in the water just like a kinda top. Upended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. Young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper. Anyway, he saw us and come in low and three hours later, a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. Y'know, that was the time I was most frightened, waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a life jacket again. So, eleven hundred men went into the water, three hundred sixteen men come out, and the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945.\"\n\n*smiles, raises his glass*\n\n\"Anyway... we delivered the bomb\"",

A priest was in his church every Sunday willing and ready to teach the Bible to whoever walked through the door. No one entered the church, and treated the priest badly throughout the town. One day he said enough was enough, he climbed up onto a cliff side that overlooked the entire town. He prayed to have a curse placed on the town. In that same month, the fire department burned to the ground. A month later, the only school within the towns limits burned. There where no casualties. The schools cinder block remains are still there to this day. Most residents moved, some stayed. The ones who stayed began to get lazy and allowed junk like old vehicles, tires, etc. to accumulate. The town basically became a junkyard with residents. The town is slowly recuperating, but no where close to how it looked all those years ago.",

It was summer and we were whiney kids so we jumped in her pool and played with her barbie toys. [Specifically this one](https://i.imgur.com/uB7dPaZ.png). A wasp tried to sting her and being the whiney kids we were, we wanted to teach this wasp a lesson. So we put him in a barbie suitcase and stuff the suitcase inside the cabinet, We thought 5 minutes would be a good time. I had the brilliant idea to throw the train into the water to make sure he thought about his actions. Not like hed down since he was in the barbie suitcase, right? We eventually forget about the wasp and the train and go back inside to play games. Hours later, we suddenly remember about the wasp and we get back inside the pool to pull the train out and check if the wasp was even alive at this point.\n\nThe wasp wasnt in the suit case, wasnt in the cabinet and wasnt in the train at all. We checked all over the pool for his body. We didn't find a dead wasp anywhere in the pool. One way or another it escaped but we both to this day swear we remember putting the wasp in the suitcase then putting the suitcase in the cabinet.",

Then they went straight to the church, where they dug holes into the fence of the yard and started to shoot at everyone there. The most terrifying chapter of the massacre happened on the night of 2 May 1876 in that very yard. On the morning of 3 May the Pomaks took the yard and advanced to the door of the church, but weren't able to get in – the door was barred by the people inside. The defense of the church held for three days, the Turkish were shooting ceaselessly at the villagers to make them surrender. Some tried to enter the church from the roof, but were unsuccessful, although they were able to shoot some of the people inside. There was no water in the church, so the barricaded had to resort to the oil of the lamps and the blood of their own dead. They tried to dig into the floor with bare hands in order to find underground water. On the third day the survivors decided to go outside, when they realized their fate was decided. When they opened the doors of the church Ahmet Aga was waiting for them with his Bashi-bozouk.

I don’t know if it’s true, but my friend had no reason to lie to me. \nMy friends cousin went to the Bahamas for vacation. This was right in the beginning of the AIDS nightmare. The night before leaving to come back to the USA, her bungalow was broken into. Her money, jewelry, camera and passport were stolen.  Of course nothing much could be done.  About two months later she received a card in the mail. Opening the card, some photo’s fell out.  Photo’s of two different naked butts, with her toothbrush inserted into each butt.  Big smiling faces, different poses, but not identifiable. The same toothbrush she had been brushing her teeth with, three times a day.  Between utter disgust, and fear of AIDS she suffered a nervous breakdown. Had to go to therapy for a couple years.  \nThis was long before the internet and I think people were a little more sheltered, more shockable.  Not making excuses of course, but we could not even imagine someone doing that.  Today we’ve all heard stories about what some people insert up there, but back then, not so much. Even though let’s face it, disgusting is still  disgusting. I guess one  never knows what some crazy person with access to your hotel room will do.  And yes, it did taste “ off” but she assumed it was just foreign water. To this day I buy a disposable toothbrush and put it in the safe whenever  I travel.

You can tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail.\n\nWhat we didn't know, was that our bomb mission was so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin' by, so we formed ourselves into tight groups. It was sorta like you see in the calendars, you know the infantry squares in the old calendars like the Battle of Waterloo and the idea was the shark come to the nearest man, that man he starts poundin' and hollerin' and sometimes that shark he go away... but sometimes he wouldn't go away.\n\nSometimes that shark looks right at ya. Right into your eyes. And the thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn't even seem to be livin'... 'til he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then... ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin'. The ocean turns red, and despite all your poundin' and your hollerin' those sharks come in and... they rip you to pieces. You know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don't know how many sharks there were, maybe a thousand. I do know how many men, they averaged six an hour.\n\nThursday mornin', Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player. Boson's mate. I thought he was asleep. I reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up, down in the water, he was like a kinda top. Upended. Well, he'd been bitten in half below the waist. At noon on the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura swung in low and he spotted us, a young pilot, lot younger than Mr. Hooper here, anyway he spotted us and a few hours later a big ol' fat PBY come down and started to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened. Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again.

Also sorry for the read, English is not my first language. \n\nDuring a trip in Amsterdam (if I remember correctly this detail), the friend of friend was clubbing and having fun when she got approached by a guy (that she described as handsome, charming and fun);things heated up in the bathroom where they kissed, gave him a BJ and other things (no proper sex). He invited her to his place to finish what they started so she ran to her other friends to let them know that she was leaving with this random guy. One of her friends told her to get his name and address, « just because you know, the world is full of crazy people ». She went back to the guy asked him for the info and he got super defensive- the friend was next to her, common sense kicks in and she asks if she could take a picture just to keep some memories of the first guy her friend is willing to follow home the first night. He cursed at them and left. They were both quite shocked by his reaction but happy she dodged a bullet of an aggressive guy that looked so charming in the first place. \n\nFast forward a few days, the girl who was already back home, started to feel under the weather. It kept getting worse and worse so she decides to go to her doctor. The way her throat looked was horrifying to the doctor, she told her that it wasn’t a « normal pharyngitis » which led her to collect a swab to further test it out. A few days later she calls her to let her know that what came back from the lab was terrifying: the bacteria they found was only found on dead bodies. \nShe had to go through a massive check by the local police that eventually ruled her out as being a criminal. \nYes you got it. She ended up telling them about the people she met lately and remembered the creep she met during her latest trip. \nEpilogue: she shared all she could and the guy was arrested a few weeks later. They apparently found 5 female bodies, cut in pieces and covered with semen. The guy was getting these women in clubs/bars, playing his most charming play and getting them home to only kill them, dismember them and continuously have sex with them. \nHer friend basically saved her life.

Come to found out that in my city there is always at least one or two home invasion rapists operating at any given time. Of course, they typically target lone females and I’m male. Still. \n\nBut the EAR/ONS case was and is chilling. The arrest and conviction has only been partially satisfying to me because we all wanted to know answers to questions we’ll now never know. Of course, things have changed and a predator like him would never be able to replicate that kind of terrorism in a community in the US or another developed country, but even removed 40 years or more and way far from California, it was deeply unsettling and I had lots of nightmares.

See this for more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn_b4NRTB6k\n\nAnd, it also looks like Dr. Fauci is somehow tied up with suppression of a hypothesis of Wuhan's Lab as the source of transmission of Covid-19 in favor of Wet Markets or animal transmission.  Possibly because Fauci supports gain of function research.  You can do a simple google search to start seeing evidence of this being rolled out.  As far as I know nothing is definitive, but if the FOIA collected emails between Fauci and his team seem to point in that direction.  \n\nAnd, I was banned from r/Coronavirus for having the temerity to suggest that the current vaccines, while I have taken them and in no way wish to prevent or dissuade anyone from receiving, do not have any information on their long term effects, like every other vaccine or medicine we have.  \n\nI don't want to be a conspiracy theorist, not my bag.  I like my government functional and boring, not something out of a god damn horror novel.  But, I'm tired of being lied to.

The genocide was so bad that several other governments had to form an alliance and fight the genocidal government, causing the number of deaths to increase by an order of magnitude.\n\n2) One of the allied governments fighting the genocidal government (mentioned above) became so determined to end this war—and perhaps to avenge an earlier attack against their homeland—the allied government developed and employed a weapon of mass destruction unlike any humanity had ever seen or even imagined before: a weapon that caused the sky to explode, that caused the harmful rays of the sun to shine an intesity never witnessed at a distance a miniscule fraction of the distance of the sun. This government employed this weapon not once but ***twice***. This government employed this weapon not to annihilate their enemy's military but to cause so much ***civilian damage*** that it instilled enough fear into its enemy—which had previously shown such viciousness as to sacrifice their own soldiers in order to inflict damage—that they would have no choice but to surrender, lest they suffer a third attack.",

I tried to scream for my Mother, who was in the next room. I only managed a squeak. I sat staring, with it staring back. I tried to scream again, I failed and it brought one finger to its \"lips\" as if to \"shush\" me. Finally, it lunged at me with what looked like a spike made of the same black fire as its body. In that instant, the paralysis left me. I acted like it was a human intruder and tried to kick the weapon out of its hands, I failed, it lunged backwards as I grabbed a weapon from beside my bed and rolled to my feet. It vanished. I don't think I scared it away, I just think it had done what it wanted to do.\n\nSM.",

The family consisted of a Grandfather, Grandmother, their daughter, and the daughter's grown-up son. The grandson had a long history of drug abuse that tore the family apart and one day the grandfather took his pistol out and attempted to kill the grandson as he was in the bathroom presumably doing heroin. The grandfather shot through the door and hit the grandson, but didn't kill him. The grandmother and their daughter started screaming and so the grandfather turned and shot both of them. I can't remember exactly if the grandmother died right then, but I know the daughter survived but was seriously injured. After this, the grandfather went and got his shotgun and blew a hole in the bathroom door to find his grandson had escaped out of the window. The grandfather then took the shotgun, shot his wife in the head, shot his daughter in the head, then put the barrel in his mouth and pulled the trigger.\n \nThis came as a complete shock to our entire community as something like this has never happened before and the grandfather was always a nice, friendly man. One of the most interesting things about this story to me is that when the grandfather shot himself, his blood and his wife's blood (who were on opposite sides of the room) joined together in the middle right beside their daughter.\n\nThe grandson who escaped had no other living relatives and has been in and out of jail for drug charges ever since. When he is out of jail, however, he lives in the same house his family died in. I don't know how he can do it",

They were having a great time and a few days in they were walking along a busy boardwalk looking for expedition companies that would take them out jet skiing. It was busy and the companies were taking appointments for the next day. The girls were impatient and wanted to go now, so when they came across two Hispanic men stating they could take them then, they jumped at the opportunity. The men wanted to only take the two girls, and said they had to take them out in their speed boat to the place where the jet skis were. The parents insisted on going of course, so they all piled into the boat and the guys steered them out into open water. After quite awhile of speeding into the open sea, all four of them start getting very uncomfortable. They all have their phones and begin texting loved ones about where they are etc without being too suspicious. Finally, all four begin looking at each other and the girls are crying- these men are stone faced, not talking to them, driving further out into the ocean. The mom texts emergency services and explains the situation, shares her location etc. Finally the boat slows down and the men put on masks with skulls on them. Just then, several coast guard and police boats surround the boat and apprehended the two men and take the family back to the main land. They told the family that they were extremely fortunate- the men were about to shoot the parents and take the girls, as they were sex traffickers and this MO had played out several times recently. \n\nIt’s easy to look at their situation in hindsight and see all the red flags, but honestly the thing that scares me most is how easily these guys were able to pass off as completely normal to tourists on vacation, eager for adventure. They just blended in. Equally chilling is how absolutely lucky that family got, because several weren’t so fortunate. \n\nMy daughter says I shelter her too much, but I remind her of this story often.",

With the help of their assistant Juraimi Husin, they had promised Mazlan that they could make him invincible and had invited him over to their home for a \"cleansing\" ritual.

Her parent would often leave for two to three day long business trips and leave her there by herself. They lived out in the middle of nowhere on a road that was really long. No one but the UPS man drove by their house. Her parents were about to leave for another trip and thought she would be fine by herself. The girl who lived there, we’ll call her Sophie, knew the UPS man who would drive by everyday. She often would have short little conversations with him while he gave her the mail. So one day while her parents were gone Rob, the UPS man came by with the mail. Sophie opened the door and greeted him and he handed her two letters and a Manila envelope that had nothing on the outside, but her name written in big read letters. He told her about how a strange lady had been walking down the road and he stopped to ask her is she needed help. She had asked him anyone lived on the road and he told her that it was confidential and drove off. Sophie thought nothing of it and went back inside. She opened the envelope that had her name on it and found picture of her at school and a couple of her socks. She called the police and her parents. They came home and the police did a short investigation and found nothing. For about a month her parents didn’t leave and she was watched most of the time by her parents. After the month was over and nothing else weird happened they began to go on trips again but this time they left Sophie with a girl. The girl was about 21 at the time and was named Mindy. Her parents went back to the two to three day trips until the company asked them to go on a week long trip. They didn’t have much of a choice so they called Mindy over packed their things and left. For the first few days nothing happened and Sophie and Mindy had a good time. One day when Rob came by with the mail he handed Sophie another Manila envelope that matches the one from before. She was anxious to open it but did. This time it had photos of her out at the mall in her house pictures from under her bed of her feet. It had a blouse in it as well. She showed Mindy who called the police and her parents, but this time they were unable to come home. They told them that they wouldn’t be long so just wait it out and tell the police. The police did another investigation with no leads or sign of who could be doing it. On the last day of the trip Monday and Sophie went to the grocery store in need of some more food. While they were in the check out line Sophie saw a lady in front of them who almost perfectly fit the description of the woman Rob had told them about. She had pale almost white skin with dark black hair. She was short and had skinny fingers that looked too small be hers. Sophie told Mindy and they followed the lady outside. She got into a UPS truck. Sophie had a really strong urge to call the UPS company and ask about it. So they did. She called and asked about the lady who was named Mary and then she told them about Rob and what he had seen. They told her that there was no one who went down her street and that all mail was supposed to be left in their mail box at the top of the road. They also told her that no man named Rob Barnes had ever been apart of the UPS.",

But hey, it was the 80's). \n\nSo my mother was born and raised in China (she is an American Italian mix). She was about 16-19 or something at the time I think, and was with the American or Portuguese embassy? Don't remember which or why. It's been a long time since I heard the story. The important thing is that she had a black embassy car plate, and they were basically untouchable at the time. You could get away with a lot of stuff with an embassy plate. My mother used to be a total adventure crazy woman. I won't go into much detail about the non relevant stuff, but she was involved with a lot of big shots, temporarily in the film industry, met Christian Bale when he was still a kid, etc etc. So she had the habit of doing crazy stuff. And you know, it was the 80's.\n\nSo around this time, she was trying to get her father's cremated remains buried as he had died recently of cancer, and the Chinese government was blocking her access to the cemetery in the area (either that or she was trying to move the already buried remains somewhere else, this part of the story I only have a hazy memory of) due to some stupid law (at the time it was difficult for foreigners to live in China. The government didn't particularly like them and the regulations were insane. Still kind of are).  \nSo my mother was going through a hard time and was very angry with the government (she has already lost her mother a few years prior. She was around 17 or 18 at the time) for this bullshit they were pulling. \n\nAnd now to the crazy part. She was out driving with some friends, don't remember where they were going, but this was a few days after the Tiananmen square massacre. So there was a military lockdown in the area and no civilian access to the square was allowed. They were driving past here and for some reason, in a fit of rage, she decided \"fuck the government, let's drive through the square.\" So she floors the gas and just guns it through. Know what else was gunning it? All the military on guard with their AK-47's. The way she told it was that through the open windows of the car you could hear the racking of 50+ automatic rifles being readied to blow the absolute fuck out of this car. Her friends in the car with her hit the deck while screaming something about her being crazy and they were all going to die, which is probably what would have happened if not for one thing:   \nThe black license plate. The military held their fire becuase shooting an embassy vehicle would have been a bad fucking idea. So she makes it through the square, turns onto the 4th ring road (5th ring? I can't remember. China's road layout is in rings around the city center) and speeds off.\n\nAnd that is the story of how my crazy mother almost got herself killed by charging through a military blockade.\nI don't know what would have happened if they caught her, but she had to escape China shortly after while being a journalist to escape the Chinese secret police. They aren't a fan of journalists broadcasting their many communistic fuckups to the world. So ya know, the good old 80's 😆",

People were placed around bombs to study shrapnel and explosion damage. Bayoneted, shot at point blank, had limbs frozen, then broken off, then refrozen. Allowed to die of gangrene, starvation, dehydration, set on fire, placed in centrifuges. \n\nThe main goal of the facility, however, was to breed domestic strains of the deadliest diseases the Japanese could get ahold of: Anthrax, Typhoid, Cholera, Tuberculosis, and Bubonic Plague. They infected prisoners, watched them crumple and die in their cells, and drained the blood from their bodies, later using it to infect fleas that were placed in clay pots and dropped in Manchuria villages, killing thousands. \n\nThe best part? Not a single victim who enter Unit 731 left alive, but much like the Nazi scientists, everyone involved at 731 got away scot free thanks to the US wanting to gain what they had learned there and, more importantly, keep the Soviets from getting that same information.",

So I had a very distinct pitch black outline that suddenly bolted inside with inhuman speed. I put the NVGs down, rubbed my eyes and looked again. Sure enough I saw a black head poke out of the darkness of the doorless home it retreated into. It looked out for 5 to 10 seconds and pulled its head back with the same quickness. I watched that balcony occasionally, to see it again possibly, however never did.

She screamed for help and tried unlocking the door, but due to the wave the lock on the door had broken stopping the door from opening. Crew were aware she was in there and after around an 3 hours broke down the door letting her out. The ship continued towards it’s destination thinking they’d get medical help there or get air lifted off, when they arrived the staff on the island turned them around sending them back to the mainland. So they went back, keep in mind my mother is in extreme pain, before they arrived the medic on board twisted the foot back to the right position. In the end she’s fine and had to have massive metal plates put into leg and foot. I can’t imagine the horror being flipped, hitting the ceiling and looking down and seeing your foot bleeding whilst the wrong way around waiting for people to break down the door for 3 hours.",

Just today Bob had his call light on, so three CNAs, two of which started after Judy had died, went to Bob's room. When they asked him what he needed he said he didn't need anything. When they asked why he turned on his call light he said it wasn't him, it was Judy. An old guy who never met Judy in his life or know of her existence knew her name and said she was there, and the CNAs who didn't know Judy back this up.\n\nApparently my work is haunted, but from what I hear Judy was nice so it's probably fine.",

Desert Storm was the first war in which the top secret US ARMY Special Forces Super Soldier Training Program have ever been deployed into from 1938 to 1991! The program began shortly after WW2 sparked by 1 simple question what could the USA possibly do if all nations of planet Earth decided to have a world war against 1 enemy the USA? The program was a top secret intertwining of Special Forces and the CIA to create Super Human Soldiers very highly trained to take on all comers in a war scenario They wanted the biggest, strongest and fastest humans on planet Earth only! Because of our platoon being labeled top secret we were mainly used to be assassins for the CIA! Then Sadaam Hussein put his foot in his mouth and threatened that he would send his republican Guard in to make all American Soldiers entering Iraq bathe in their own blood! We were deployed 1 at a time to absolutely destroy what he thought about his Republican Guard, when the 2nd faction of the Super Soldier Program started to be deployed it struck so much fear in him that the rest of the war he was hiding in an underground bunker terrified of what he saw on video! The second faction are labeled by the CIA as Biologics (not biological weapons they are 2 completely different things) Biologics are actual living beings, part animal and part human gene spliced and fused together The largest land dweller of the 13 biologics was the Human/Lion 12 feet tall 54 inch chest and 42 inch biceps 3 inch black claws on his huge fingers and 2 inch black claws on his huge toes, pointed teeth on a snout that is about half as long as a normal lions would be, the weird part was the Main went solely around the neck only and did not come up to the head like a normal lions does!  There were 13 different types of Biologics when I served in 1991, They were talking about trying to create Spirits bringing the US ARMY more into a Supernatural fighting force! Rather than just a human fighting force! I don't know if they kept up with what they were trying to do I had to leave because of the CIA trying to kill me twice!",

He knocks on the Door saying he wants so apologize, and Gabriel let's him in. Right after Daniel walks in, he closes the door and locks it. (Gabriel's mom or dad was not home at the time). He then begins to rape and beat Gabriel ferociously. After that, he grabs a video game console cord, and Strangles gabriel, and continues to rape him (He didn't kill him though, and Gabriel is screaming in pain and agony this whole time) After he finished this, he wanted to hide the (still alive) body of Gabriel in a crawl space. Gabriel is currently passed out. Daniel walks into the kitchen and grabs a knife and a hacksaw, and begins cutting off Gabriel's arms and legs. Gabriel wakes up while Daniel is sawing his legs off, and screams in pain and horror. Daniel laughs, and continues sawing, but the body still doesn't fit. He then proceeds to stab the body in anger then leaves. And Gabriel is only 12. Gabriel's brother comes home soon after, and sees the body of his dead, mutilated brother, drops to his knees, and screams for help.\n\nTldr: A friend rapes, strangles, and mutilates the body of his 12 year old friend over a video game.",

It employed mainly Jewish and young Italian female immigrants and worked about nine hours a day and earned around $7-$12 a week. \n\nAll of that changed on the 25th of March when a fire lit up in one of the scrap bins on the 8th floor of the building, the first alarm went off 5 minutes after the fire began, and within minutes, the fire began to get bigger and bigger. The employees on the 9th floor apparently had no idea of what was happening and it had no audible fire alarm and no telephone, the 10th floor had a telephone and was warned. As the fire was escalating, many workers had to use the stairway or freight elevator as their ways down the building, but there were many workers still trapped mainly on the 9th and 10th floors. As firefighters arrived, their ladders weren’t high enough to reach even the 8th floor, it could only reach the 7th. People eventually gathered on the streets on saw many employees still trapped on the top floors and saw many of them jumping about 100 feet from the building onto the concrete pavement, many of which fell to their deaths. As many as 62 died from jumping from the building. The rest of the workers died from either getting burned alive or suffocating from the smoke as they were desperately trying to escape. \n\nIt is still considered one of the worst industrial disasters in US history, with about 145 dead.

They continue on their hike for a while and the friend left at the cottage decides he wants to join them. He goes down the road and starts thinking something is following him. He keeps walking while looking behind him every now and then and notices a little gnome hiding behind the trees and brush behind him.

Pablo lived in a two family house, and his down stairs neighbors seems normal. They were always parting down stairs and occasionally we’d join them. (We were kids just trying to have fun) the weird thing was the grandma that would sit on the porch every day, me being friendly I always greater her saying hello but she never acknowledged me I thought “meh she’s just old” she never moved shed sit there for hours just staring. (Kinda looked like the lady from taking of Deborah Logan) anyway, one night after drinking, all three of us went down stairs to begin our drunken walk home. We look over the railing leading down the stairs on the porch cause we thought we herd something move and I shit you not when we turned around she was standing directly behind us. We looked at her shocked and I remember saying a frightened “hey how you doing?” This time she responded. What she said to us still gives me nightmares “Can you boys stand the sight of blood, cause tonight I’m going to kill myself in the bathroom” and gave a freaky laugh. We ran as fast as we could by her. When I got home I told my grandma to call the cops and to let them know what happened. My grandmother told me the people who lived downstairs in that house have been there since my mother was my age. And told me that no old woman ever lived there. Which still fucks me up. Who was she and why was she just sitting there every day.",

            "text": "The story of the Japanese people from the beginning of World War II to the end of the war and to this day it’s something then I’ll believe it’s terrifying of what actually happened, The fact that the atomic bombs not only saved many Americans but the fact that the atomic bombs actually saved the entire civilization of Japan from complete corruption that would have eventually led to the complete collapse and disintegration of the Japanese culture.\n\nUsing bits and pieces from first person sources and third, the Japanese in World War Two or one of the most rape and pillage societies to exist ever. This is not something I like to think about, it is not something that I enjoy trying to tell other people about. At the beginning of World War II, Adolf Hitler, was not in favor of becoming allies with the Japanese what so ever. Even with the beginning of the genocide of the Jewish people in Germany, it was known that the Japanese were completely sexually ruthless when it came to moving in and taking over another County. The Nazis believed the Japanese were insane and crazy. Adolf Hitler, actually believed that the kamikaze attack method was absolutely a disgrace and not something that was at all a way to fight a war. It was known that the Japanese army would be sent a constant supply chain of Japanese prostitutes, whom had been brainwashed into believing that allowing hundreds of men to sexually do whatever they please to them was in the best interest of the country. Even with this many children in China and women were sexually assaulted to extend that you and I can hardly believe in refused at some extent that it actually happened. \n\nDue to the fact that the Japanese were able to have a very powerful industrial military complex what is the factor that led the Nazis to become allies when they had realized America was joining the war.\n\nThe best way I can explain this is to imagine North Korea today, Religion for bidden, outside news and information not allowed. The Japanese people were being brainwashed into believing their emperor was God. Therefore, anything the emperor said was holy and righteous. \n\nThe atomic bombs that finally entered the war, not only created a new beginning but also saved the Japanese from the continuing to fight and not thinking about how insane the disturbing propaganda forced upon them, would have led to Japan destroying itself completely. If the bombs had not fallen, the amount of Japanese civilians who would have eventually died and the number of family that would have been destroyed would be incomprehensible. The Japanese spacebelieved that it was their duty to their emperor “God“ to continue fighting no matter what the amount of people who then would have died in Japan would be 10 times or more greater than what the atomic bombs did. \n\nThis information is hard to digest and comprehend due to the fact that the bombs were so tragic and devastating but without them there would have been a much much more hellacious outcome for the entire country of Japan and if they did not use the bombs at all. Truth is the Japanese were suddenly awaken and saw how wrong they had been led for so many years. \n\nThe Japanese are very strong and very ambitious at ensuring their country is running smoothly. And the warnfinally ended, the time that it took for 99% of the Japanese population to understand that their belief of what reality was, had been a lie. The time that it took for 99% of the population to immediately re-calibrate their perspective of reality is astonishing. In less than two years the Japanese viewed America as a hero and would consider America ally from that day forward. The lives that were lost during World War II are countless and it was an absolute incredible devastation for everyone no one had it easy. But the fact that the Japanese were able to recover and immediately realize they had been brainwashed. They knew and understood that America had come to help them create a new society that would be better than anything they ever had. they soon started rebuilding alongside with the US military and contractors to rebuild their society to become greater than it had ever been before. To view the atomic bomb as a device that actually saved more people than you could possibly imagine at the sacrifice of so many lives, just seems to be in an impossible thought. But this was the truth of the Japanese in World War II. It is beautiful that we have one of the strongest relationships with Japan to this day and that the population welcomes Americans to visit and absolutely believes The culture of western civilization Is positive and joyful and peaceful shows how something so tragic can bring a wonderful Outcome in the end. I highly respect the people of Japan, it was not their fault they had become slaves due to extreme suppressing leader ship just as North Korea is today and also How Russia was completely put into slavery due to Stalin, Executing countless Russians in the 1950s, These were people who fought in the Russian army to defend their country, these were people who sacrificed everything to ensure Russia would not fall to the Nazis or the Japanese.  It didn’t matter if you were hero From World War II, Stalin committed genocide against his own people regardless of who they were. No one was safe. Now, you can understand with a Japanese we’re going through with their emperor in World War II. We save them from an emperor who was completely out of control. \n\nGeneral MacArthur, did one of the most righteous acts you could have done he for gave the emperor he told the Japanese people to forgive the emperor. The emperor was allowed to remain as emperor however under a completely new government and society believes taught by the United States after peace had finally come. General MacArthur explained to many Japanese civilians not to follow him, but you forgive and start new with a new set of democratic principles and a democracy. \n\nI find this to be one of the most amazing events that there is hope for all of humanity if something so tragic turned out to set a path of a new prosperous journey for an entire civilization. to me this is terrifying, For it is so hard to except and understand how the events played out in this manner when it is not discussed or talked about at all today but it is something that should be known and remembered so in the future Other civilians of a suppressed communist dictator ship, Who believe that you are the enemy can be shown a way of peace and prosperity.\n\nI hope what I have stated and said doesn’t make sense it is something that many may refuse to even consider the idea of and I can understand that it is not an easy pill to swallow but it is something that happened. \n\nThank you for your time. I hope I have been able to bring a perspective to you if you did not know this before or had thought that it was a complete devastating thing to drop the atomic bombs.",

My family.   \n\nOne of our local families in our convoluted family tree has a son who has been ill for a long time with paranoid schizophrenia. He was in and out of care, on and off medications. He wasn't always like this. We watched him grow up. He was a good kid, if a little defiant.   \n\nSeveral years ago, he had gotten to a place where his parents felt comfortable allowing him to live independently in a home they owned about 20 minutes from their home. He was stable and employed. But as happens with many patients, he went off his meds. His parents stopped by to check on him and realized that he needed to be hospitalized again.   \n\nThey tried to get him into the car, but he was in the middle of a full-blown psychotic break. All they saw was their baby in pain. They didn't see the danger he posed. His dad tried to muscle him into the car, and the son went off. Stabbed him in the neck with a pocket knife, then as his wife tried to save him and call 911, he got a pistol and shot him dead.  \n\nWe were probably as different as two people could be, but this man was there for his grandkids when his daughter and son-in-law were in and out of addiction and jail. He was a money-where-his-mouth-is, church-every-Sunday, work-the-overtime-if-offered kind of guy. And he must have been so hurt and so scared. His own son...  \n\nThe son will never get out of prison. And his mother will never be the same. His siblings, kids, and grandkids sure aren't.  \n\nLots of people ask why his parents didn't put him in a mental hospital, but there just aren't many around and a lot of insurance in the U.S. doesn't cover mental health care. It has created a terrible and self-fulfilling cycle that feeds the prison pipeline and the homeless population.  \n\nThe problem will get worse before it gets better.

But my home room teacher took me under her wing and was amazingly sweet. She helped me to break out of my shell and enjoy school. Anyways she had a daughter in my class and a foster son in my sisters (one year ahead of me). She spoke of him everyday. Saying how proud she was of him and how happy she was that she adopted him. \n\nI didn’t speak to her daughter much, but she was always mean and pissed offed looking. Her son hung out with my sister’s friends a lot. My sister was creeped out by him. He would say weird things and do erratic stuff. One day when they were crossing the bridge to school he grabbed my sister and held her over the river. She was terrified. He just laughed and eventually put her down. The group laughed it off, but it was def weird. Fast forward to my freshman year of high school. I still stayed in contact with my teacher, cuz she was just awesome and so easy to talk to. But one day when I got to school all our teachers immediately ushered us into the auditorium. Everyone was super confused. The principal got up on stage. Then he told everyone to be quiet and said that my teacher had died that morning. He explained that she was killed. I was in shock. Kids around me started making fun of her and I couldn’t stop crying. They sent us home early that day. While heading out Some kids told me what happened.\n\nMy teacher woke up, made breakfast and was sitting at her table at home doing a crossword. Her son walked up behind her and shot her point blank in the back of the head. Then him and his sister ran and took the car. Apparently both had been planning it for months. I cannot explain how hard this story hits me. Having known all the people involved. I also recently found out that he was just barely fully convicted in 2018. I looked up the article and it’s hard to look at his picture. \n\nHere’s the article: https://www.wcax.com/content/news/Vermont-man-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-foster-mom-501360421.html",

Couldn’t forget that for a few days, it really haunts me. \n\nAnyways in that one story he recalls how there where two teenage German girls screaming for their mother or something, he signalled em to hide because his soldier buddies usually rape everyone. A while later tho the soldiers found them and started raping them. They stood in a line to use them when the other one was finished and they started bleeding until they passed out. One soldier then got a gun and shot the girls in the head. \nAfter that they were thrown into the pigs den or how it’s called. The soldier recalling this came back an hour later and found that what was left of them were just the bones, the pigs were hungry. \n\nIf anyone wants to watch it I think I can find the video again.\n\nThat story also reminds me of another rape story my mother told me about that’s more sad than disturbing.\nBack in east Germany there was this classmate of hers that one day got mass raped by a group of Soviet soldiers and afterwards became a crazy woman. She could never think straight and the Russians obviously went unpunished because in some sense they had superiority over the occupied territory",

They lived in the projects most of their life at that point but moved somewhere only slightly less dangerous once they started having kids. An important note is when you live in the ghetto, you learn to brush off noise and mind your own business. \n\nAnyway, one night my mom and my Tía were hanging out in the living room. There had been music playing down the street all afternoon and as the night got later, the music got louder. There was a party a few houses down but if you ignore it, it eventually becomes background noise. \n\nWell the next day, they woke up to find a crime scene blocked off at the house that had the music playing.

            "text": "I love the creepy and paranormal, no idea why, just do, I like being creeped out or scared, the adrenaline from it is intoxicating. I get most my fix from Nuke's Top 5, Chills, and on the podcast front Morbid and the creme de le creme, The Last Podcast on the Left. So I know a lot of creepy and scary stories, but I'll tell you the scariest thing I have ever been adjacent to. \n\nYou see, I met one of my best friends ever, on the interwebs, playing league of legends. When we met, he went by Dovacarry. He was a CS major, and a nerd who loved Skyrim more then anything, so for the most part all of his handles were a play on Dovakihm. I would eventually learn that his name was Cody, and as I alluded too above, we became the best of friends. He was infinitely better at league, light-years ahead of me, plat without trying, diamond or above if he ever cared to try. He was M7 on every adc. I was his mediocre support who rode his coat tails hard lol. He just liked making friends though, and he saw me through so many rough nights, having found me when I had recently been diagnosed with Manic Depression. He became an anchor in my life in so many ways. The fondness between us, saw us take our friendship from off just the web, and solidify those bonds IRL. I being older and not in school with a job and all that, bit the bullet and bought a plane ticket out to VA and flew out to meet my buddy, The Codster, the Dovacarry himself. And I wish the horror of this story came when Cody and his girl picked me up from the airport, like this is some sort of catfish scenario. In hindsight, that may have been....I don't know, I digress. It wasn't anything like that, it was perfect. Cody was taller in person, but when he stepped out of his girlfriends car's driver seat, and came round to help me put my bags up, I opted for a hug immediately. And I knew in that moment, I'd found a friend for life. I became fast friends with him and his girlfriend, and our cohort of other friends we played with from VA. Our friendships grew and we made trips to see one another, we saw eachother last this past October. We all gathered in VA and stayed at Cody's apartment over Halloween weekend to watch worlds and to just get wasted and or stoned, and enjoy eachothers company. I remember when I left Cody's, we walked to the corner store around the way from his apartment, bought some smokes, and waited there for my Uber. When I hugged him goodbye, I was so sad, felt like I was leaving my own family. \n\nAnd then, six months later, the horror. I had talked to Codster two days before. Dumb unrelated, but I had gotten stood up by a girl I had high hopes for and then ghosted, blocked everywhere. I was distraught, Cody was my first call, he always put things in perspective and leveled me out. He was wise beyond his years. The last thing he said to me, \"don't even sweat this homie, this is our year, we're gonna kill it, just you watch, then we are gonna kick in the sand this summer, look back and laugh.\" Two days later, the Monday after Easter. I saw a message on discord in one of our servers. It read, \"I really hate to have to say this, but our friend Dova passed away last night.\" I laughed, figured it was some jab at Cody drinking too many Mike's hards and getting white girl wasted to the point that he couldn't play. So I hopped into the server and saw that my group chat with Cody, his girlfriend, and all our homies was lit up. So I jumped in there with a sinking heart and got the story. \n\nThe night before, Cody had a date night with his girl, he mentioned it, and they spent all day out and then canoodled about. His girl had to go back to her place to get ready for work in the morning. So Codster grabbed the trash and walked her down to her car, telling he he loved her and he would text her when he got back up from the dumpster. She never heard from him for the rest of the night, figured he got distracted by league or passed out. Then when she had not heard from him in the morning, she got concerned and pinged his phone. It was at the police station. She wigged out and drove down there, thinking maybe he had witnessed a crime or got picked up for something dumb. When she got there though and explained herself, she was taken to a room with a detective. Who matter of factly explained that Cody walked down to the corner store we always went to after dropping the trash. Either heading to the store for an Arizona or well, we don't know really. All we know is he was walking down the block towards the store, and he was shot six times and died right there, alone. \n\nIt has been two months now, and my heart isn't even done breaking. Nothing in life has ever been this scary, that such an incredible person, could just be blinked out of existence like that. He didn't deserve it, no one does, but not Cody. He was everyone's friend you know? He loved everyone. No one would have been targeting him that I can think of. In my mind it had to have been a robbery gone wrong, someone just getting their rocks off, or there are rumors that his shooting was connected to another that happened on the same block on the same weekend. Some people think the first shooting was revenge for that specific person selling someone bad drugs, and that those people were also after that person's roommate, and they think Cody was mistaken for whoever that was. But that is conjecture, the police haven't told us anything else. I flew out there for his funeral and spoke, and started a go fund me and raised 12k for his mom for funeral costs. I'm also flying out there at the end of this month to rent a beach house with his girlfriend and our friends, so we can have the beach trip Cody wanted. And then I'm gonna float some river and get drunk with his mom and brothers for the 4th. And we are also currently playing a league of legends tourney and streaming it every weekend to try and raise 10k to donate to Cody's old school in rural VA. \n\nBut this shit has changed me, I just wish I had my little brother back you know?",

We were terrified, I had been verbally and physically abused by her before, but we stupidly didn’t call the cops.\n\nNote: we had just smoked a little weed, were not in a position to make the best decisions, and were definitely feeling some heightened paranoia.\n\nThis house was in the hills and on almost an acre. Pretty secluded.\n\nThe doors were locked and we decided to chill out upstairs in my room and wait it out. Bad decision. This is just pre cell phone days. We left the cordless downstairs.\n\nThere was an attached tool shed and she grabbed a claw hammer. First she popped my hood and thrashed my distributor cap and wire leads. Great.\n\nNext she jimmied the back sliding glass door to the kitchen and got inside. She banged around downstairs for a terrifying minute or so and headed upstairs.\n\nThe interior doors to this place were solid oak. At least in the rental addition which had been converted from a garage and two bedrooms added as a second floor.\n\nShe vacillated between crying/pleading and screaming insults and homophobic taunts at us and then attacked the door with the hammer. \n\nMy friend was a cyclist and had a bike downstairs in the main room. Our plan was I would distract her while he climbed out a window, onto an overhang, drop to the ground, enter through the breached sliding glass door, quietly grab his bike (we hoped she hadn’t damaged it) and book it downtown about two miles to the police station for help.\n\nIt worked, but she heard him, but not before he hauled ass down the driveway. She hung out in the driveway a bit, chuffing around like an enraged beast that let its prey escape, and then, for whatever reason, she got in her car and drove off. But she turned left out of the driveway, which was a dead end culdesac a couple hundred yards away. I kept an eye on the street to see if she left.\n\nAn officer arrived with my friend, interviewed us, and surveyed the damage. We had the right to press charges. For whatever reason, my dumb 20-yr old self didn’t. I just wanted her escorted away. He either didn’t ask or didn’t suspect the weed. I always like to imagine he just kept it to himself because I’m certain he smelled it.\n\nHe located her in the culdesac and after what seemed like forever, he followed her out to the main street.\n\nI wound up getting a restraining order after that. That hysterical screaming, pleading, nasty taunting, and the sound of that hammer still haunt me.\n\nNote: I ended up paying a couple hundred dollars for a new oak door but the owner graciously stained it for me. No other damage was done other than the minor damage to my car’s ignition system and my mental stability, of course.\n\nEpilogue: I still think about her, our tumultuous and abusive relationship, and that insane horror movie-like night. I got curious a couple years ago and started Googling. She died about 20 years after that of Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. I was both relieved and deeply saddened.\n\nEdit: for phone detail.",

It was always one of those things that we joked about amongst us. \n\nAnyways... one evening after closing some of the tour guides were messing with a brand new tour guide and told her to go sweep the cave. (Remember, this is a cave so I thought this was the practical joke... nope).  They told her to  make sure she got back in an area that was quite a ways back from the entrance. Once they saw she was back there, they started swinging the extremely large, thick, bank-vault like door shut. They managed to get it shut while she was still making a beeline for the entrance. They then turned off the cave lights from the outside. \n\nI told the guys to let her out quick and not prolong the torture. We all heard the faint screaming and banging on the vault. And then it stopped. We all quickly rushed to get the door open. Flipped the lights on, but she wasn't anywhere to be seen. She was tucked away behind a corner, quite a ways away from the entrance. Farther than we thought she could make it in the dark. \n\nShe was sitting on the ground, rocking back and forth with her arms wrapped around her knees hyperventilating. After we got her somehwat calmed down, all she said was \"someone grabbed me.\"  \n\nShe was never the same after that night. She was a bubbly outgoing person before, and a quiet standoffish person after. We could never get her to talk more about it and she quit soon after.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add that I was not really part of the prank. I was a young high school kid and had dealt with 10+ years of bullying. The college guys pulling the prank were older, stronger, and more aggressive and it made me retract into my shell like I did with my school bullies. I tried speaking up but was afraid that I'd be attacked as well. I'm not proud of it, but bullying makes kids handle life in some pretty awful ways.

Today the city grew a lot and the near forest was removed further). To arrive in the city, you need to do a 4 to 6-hour long trip by boat. There are no roads to get there (today there is a landing road for small aircraft tho, I believe).\n\nThe place is very isolated, and when it's the rain season, the river overflows and floods parts of the small city (I don't know if the term \"city\" is correct. It was more or less under 10.000 people living there at that time, but I will call it like that). The houses in the flooding areas were all built over pillars of thick wood, connecting each house in a kind of suspended street. Small deformed crabs infested the mud below that houses when the water receded while fishes and other aquatic creatures could be seen when it was high... Some are cool like river dolphins... Others... Like the crocodiles and giant snakes, a little terrifying...\n\nI said all of this for you people to understand what was the background of my family... Isolated city, middle of a jungle, near predators, and constant floodings that it was treated as part of life in that region. Add to that the religious beliefs of the population that was influenced by Catholicism, but never let go of their root traditions from the natives, like legends and myths, sometimes mixing European folklore with our own through the time (for example, did you know that we have legends of \"werewolves\" too? But they don't exactly transform into wolves per se... Huge wild pigs are the beast... Go check the Brazilian folklore, you will find it interesting)... And let me tell you, some of them may be a little ridiculous and even funny when you are reading about them in your home in the major city or capital far away from there... But when you hear about them from the locals, in the middle of the dammed rainforest at night... It's an entirely different beast.\n\nMy uncle worked on the first bakery in the city. He waked up very early because people there wake up with the sun to buy bread. It was his routine. He always took a road that passed on the border of the city, nearing the dense forest, from Mondays to Saturdays. We all knew that it was risky. Big cats roamed in the jungle (\"Onça-Pintada\" is what we call them. A kind of big yellow jaguar with black spots and a maw made to one-hit primates) near the region and they are nocturnal... And my uncle did walk past the area in an hour that they were still actively hunting.\n\nOne day, he's gone missing. He left to work early hours of the day while still raining, but didn't get to it. Everyone was searching for him for the entire day but found nothing. On the morning of the next day, he came back to his home, where my grandma and his brothers lived (they all shared a big area where they all built their homes on). He was pale as if his soul was scared out of his body. Everyone was happy that he was alive, but when asked where he was this entire time or what happened, he didn't tell anything. He just got all scared again and remained in silence for a couple of hours until his mind turned down the fear enough to tell anyone to not ask about it.\n\nAnd so we did. More than 30 years have passed and no one talks about it with him. We all knew about the stories of what you can find in the forest... The real things were sometimes so horrible as if the mythical ones...\n\nJust remember. As my old Grandma said when she was alive (died in 2008 at 102 years old), \"When it's raining and you are in the forest, if you hear someone calling your name, don't answer, no matter how strong the impulse is\".",

This is the same stream responsible for the Tunguska event in 1908, when a 650-foot chunk of comet exploded 15,000 feet above Siberia, flattening 800 square miles of forest.\n\nThis is a day time meteor stream with the stream coming from the direction of the sun, so 99% of telescopes can’t watch it for dangerous incoming objects. Each year we just cross our fingers, close our eyes, and hope nothing happens.\n\nMost meteors in meteor showers are the size of a grain of rice to a can of Coke. In the 2016 shower I believe…we had two meteors of 650+ feet enter the atmosphere. Astronomers now believe we are entering the center of the Taurid stream, the leftover remnants of Comet Encke which used to be 60 miles wide and is now only 3 miles wide, meaning it’s spread 57-miles of comet debris throughout the inner solar system, aka Shoemaker-Levy’s string of pearls, and we don’t know where most of it is. There’s a general consensus pieces as big as 15km are likely still out there, undiscovered. But one thing we do know…we are passing through the heart of it in June 2032, and astronomers aren't underplaying it, they say there's reason for concern.\n\nNot fact but likely: this meteor shower caused a major, major impact event 12,900 years ago…the Younger Dryas Impact Event. It’s what caused the sudden extinction of megafauna like mammoths, short-nose bears and giant sloths in North America. And the great floods all the religions talk about. Earth was subjected to 5,000-10,000 Tunguska-size or larger air bursts and impacts in roughly an hour from this June meteor storm, largely centered over Greenland, Canada and the the US.

The deportees were forcibly sent to the small, isolated island in Western Siberia, located 540 kilometers (340 mi) northwest of Tomsk, Russian SFSR, to construct a \"special settlement\". \n\nThey were abandoned with only flour for food, and little in the way of tools, clothing, or shelter, and those who attempted to leave were killed by armed guards. The conditions of the island led to widespread disease, abuse of power, violence, and cannibalism. \n\nWithin thirteen weeks, over 4,000 of the deportees related to Nazino Island had died or disappeared, and a majority of the survivors were in ill health.”\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazino_tragedy",

The streets literally ran red with blood. I remember they showed a clip on CNN at the time and the cameraman was on a car/truck driving down residential streets with bodies everywhere and blood running into the gutters, and one guy carrying a machete waved at the camera.\n\nThe Hutu killers went after neighbors, childhood friends, customers and shop owners. The radio broadcast the locations of hiding Tutus so the Hutus could hunt them down.\n\nWhat did the West do? They had UN peacekeepers who begged for help but it was, you know, Africa (eye roll) so they did nothing until the slaughter as complete.\n\nIf you think that was some aberration of the Dark Continent - it wasn't. It's human nature. All a group of people need is the inspiration of someone or a group of someone telling them it's kill or be killed.\n\nFun fact too (quote from https://www.templeseeker.com/rwandan-genocide-dogs/) - You will see very few dogs in Rwanda – most dogs are either pets of expats or stray dogs that have come over the Ugandan border. After the 1994 Rwandan genocide, all the dogs of Rwanda became pack animals. Even the domestic dogs ended up feeding on human flesh as their owners were no longer alive to feed and look after them.\n\nAll of the dogs were shot after the genocide – the situation was too bad to repair and the dogs remaining had become rabid and aggressive.",

We sexted a few times, flirted, even hooked up once. \n\nAnyway, one night I was supposed to pick her up and bring her to my place to hangout and spend the night. I ended up flaking as I usually do. \n\nThat night her roommate strangled her to death after an argument. As far as I know, it was pretty random and unpredictable, and he just happened to break or snap that night. \n\nOne can assume this eventually would have happened on another night or another time, but I know with 100% certainty that if I hadn’t flaked on our plans, she would have at least lived another day.\n\n\nI have another friend where our relationship was somewhat similar, but to a lesser degree. \n\nHer boyfriend (who had just asked her to marry him) was a vet who snapped one night and held her hostage for a few hours in their garage, before shotgunning her in the head and then killing himself. We had talked a bunch of times about how her bf was slightly problematic and a little too intense. She was a sexworker and he hiiiiighly disapproved. We had actually gotten closer the few weeks leading up to it and the day before this happened we had an entire conversation about how excited she was to be engaged, how it wasn’t something she realized she wanted or was prepared for but decided to dive in and go for it, and leave sex work. \n\nAgain in this case, I try not to think about it too much, because there are obviously trains of thought I could go down that wouldn’t be healthy for me. \n\n\nA third friend of mine with a similar relationship to me got drunk and passed out in her yard and froze to death with friends inside the house. \n\nThe very same night I also got fucked up and passed out in MY backyard, in the exact same weather. I was on shrooms (9 grams) and smoked a blunt on my back porch. I was out there for so long that when I finally woke up, I was so ridiculously numb that I was 100% convinced I was dead until about 16 hours later when the trip ended and I rentered the world. I was 17 at the time and hiding the trip from my mom so I stayed in my room with a buddy the whole time, and wasn’t exposed to the rest of the world, which only furthered my conviction that I was dead. I can’t describe what it was like to spend that long not being able to feel a single inch of my body and being convinced I had died. \n\nAs soon as the trip wore off is when I found out my friend had died in extremely similar circumstances. \n\nAll three deaths happened within about a year or two of each other and we all knew each other and were apart of the same circles. \n\nI doubt anyone is gonna read this Bc I’m late to this thread but I just wanted to type it out for once after all these years.",

I called my dad because I was worried that my brother stopped responding to me.  My dad proceeds to give the phone to my mom. We start small talk and in the background I hear the most heartbreaking noise in the world. My dad screaming my brother’s name. It started out annoyed and quickly turned to complete desperation. The sound my father made will forever be in my mind.",

Her case was REALLY strange though; she was missing for about 20 days and then her body was 'discovered' in a place that many searchers swore they searched. None of the people she had been partying with the night she dissapeared were taken in, police basically ignored the family and their cries for justice and further investigation, and little has been done since. \n\nhttps://heavy.com/news/2020/01/selena-selina-not-afraid-notafraid-missing/\n\nAnother horrifying case was the murder of Antonio Renova, 5, at the hands of his biological parents (the papers make sure to point out he was bludgeoned to death and was covered in \"brain matter\"). The worst part of this story is that Tony spent most of his early life with amazing foster parents (because he was born with FAS) who showered him in love. The problem is that the foster family is white, whereas Tony was Native American. His foster family did everything they could to keep him involved with his culture; they grew his hair long and did the traditional braids, they took him to pow wows, and yet the judge had him returned to his parents after they got out of prison. The damn judge was quoted with saying, during the hearing, \"I’ll be damned if I’ll be the first Crow judge to let a white couple adopt a Crow child.\" The baby spent a year being tortured by his \"parents\" before they murdered him. This case absolutely ENRAGED me, and still does. \n\n https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/18/foster-boy-5-sad-eyes-died-covered-brains-judge-returned-jailbird-parents-11928770/",

I went to an unremarkable but decent high school, I lived in at the time what was known as \"Medical Center\" in the city as it was a large concentration of hospitals, various specialty clinics, health schools, etc. Anyways, in the beginning to middle of Junior year there was large scare going around at the time of a string of sexual assaults & robberies taking place in the area & every victim described it being done by one suspect, over time he became known as \"The Medical Center rapist\". Nobody was able to track him down for a while & this scare went on for about the whole of Junior year into the summer heading towards Senior year & then it just stopped at about the beginning of my Senior year.\n\nThe reason I bring up my Junior year is because I had a class, 2nd period Spanish 1 class to be exact. Nothing too crazy in that class, a typical mish mash of students & a really nice teacher & everyone fairly recognizes each other. More on this later, So after I graduated & moved away (It was one year after I had moved), I get a text from my mother with a link to a local news article with her saying \"Do you know this kid???\". I clicked the link the article & sure enough they had caught \"The Medical Center rapist\". As it turns out, he was an 18 year old (at the time of committing the rapes he was 16-17 yrs old) kid I had 2nd period Spanish with in my Junior year. I won't give his full name but I will call him \"AH\", if you go to google & type in \"San Antonio Medical Center rapist\" you will see it. I shared a full year of class with a serial rapist, he was committing rapes in the same time I had class with him & nobody was none the wiser. He seemed like a normal kid, he had a gf, was part of the basketball team, had friends & didn't really raise any red flags. To think it could have been my friends, sisters or my mother attacked & it would have been a kid in my class without knowing & the realization of seeing him everyday with him possibly committing a sexual assault just the night before, I messaged various friends & even some ex Spanish 2 classmates I had & they were as shocked as I was, we couldn't believe it.\n\nWant to hear the real kicker? He was arrested TWO DAYS after he graduated (he was a year below me & like I said, it was almost exactly one year after I graduated that they caught him). His trial lasted about 2 years & in the mean time all of his friends ran online protests like \"Release AH, we know he's innocent\" & \"Justice for wrongly convicted AH\", little did they know, they had substantial evidence against AH, they had DNA evidence from the rapes, fingerprints, the various victims & witnesses confirmed that it was indeed their attacker & after two years of trials & testimonies, he received 99 years of prison (I don't know the full details of his sentence but it doesn't look like he's ever getting out as he shouldn't, if you really want to know the full details feel free to look up the articles yourselves, easy search). An 18 year old ex rapist classmate ruined his life just as he was about to live it, he even had a committed gf at the time of all of this (I even had her for a class in Senior year) & had plenty of friends & loving family, he had a good life. I can't imagine how his gf & family felt. I'm glad he's in prison & will likely never get out. It still shocks me to this day that there really are monsters all around us that we can't exactly see & are really good at hiding their evil & blending in.",

            "text": "The Hinterkaifeck Murders.\n\nHinterkaifeck was a small independent farmstead in Bavaria, Germany, around 70km (43 Miles) north of Munich.\n\nNear the end of March 1922, the people living on began noticing more and more weird incidents. A newspaper from Munich was found near the entrance to the Farmstead two weeks before the murders, even though nobody on the Farm or living near it had ever bought or read it. Their Neighbors noticed tracks in the snow leading to the Farmstead in the days prior several times, even though none of the Inhabitants had left due to the Weather. One of their door-keys suddenly vanished, and the Farmer, Andreas Gruber, noted to Neighbors and friends several times that he could have sworn to have spotted a lone man watching the Farmstead from the edge of the forrest, but nobody believed him. At one point he tried to get help from others after he had hears steps on the families attic and couldn't find anybody there when he went looking, but nobody believed him and so he had to return without help. One of the reasons why nobody believed him was that he had been convicted of having been in an incestous relationship with his Daughter in 1915, and it was widely believed that he was the actual father of her two-year old Son Josef.\n\nOn the 31st of March 1922, an unknown Assailant broke into the Farmstead, and murdered all 6 Inhabitants with [this farming-tool.](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/none/path/sc53fabfa55e420c3/image/ibb603040ded23579/version/1583149567/mordwaffe-hinterkaifeck-reuthaue.jpg)\n\nThe Farmer, Andreas Gruber, his wife Cäzilia and their widowed Daughter Viktoria Gabriel which had moved back to the farm were all brutally beaten to death near a door leading from the Stable to the Barn. The Assailant then entered the main house, killed the still sleeping Maid Maria Baumgartner, and finally killed Viktorias 7-year old Daughter Cäzilia Gabriel and her 2-year old Son Josef, who was still in his crib. The Assailant didn't leave immidieatly but spent another couple hours at the farm at least, since cows had been milked and the entire storage of bread been eaten. Even worse, forensic studies concluded that the 7-year old Cäzilia had lived in agony for atleast another two hours after the assailant had tried to murder her.\n\nDue to the farms isolated location, nobody discovered the murders for another 4 days, until the Neighbors grew concerned due to the family not showing up to Sunday-mass or answering when one of them had come over to help repair some machinery.\n\nWhen the police from Munich arrived at the scenery, it was noted that the Attic had covered in hay, likely to damp steps, and that several roof-tiles had been moved or removed, allowing someone hiding on it to oversee the entire Farm with ease. They also found out that it was impossible to hear what was going on in the Barn and Stable from the living room, which lead them to believe that the Assailant had lured the family into the barn one-by-one and beat them to death there. Despite days of thorough searching and questioning of everybody even remotely close to the farm or family, a bounty of 100,000 Mark for any tips leading to the arrest of the assailant and even handing the skulls of the victims over to Mediums at the end out of desparation, no one was ever arrested or convicted for the Murders, although a number of people were suspected.  \n\n\nThe most promising suspects were:\n\n\\- Karl Gabriel:\n\nViktorias Husband had been reported killed by an artillery-shell during the Battle of Arras, but after the Murders some people had claimed to have spotted him in the Area, some even claiming to have talked to him. He had apparently heard that his wife had another child after he \"died\" (the 2-year old Josef) and killed the family out of revenge. The theory got some new wind after WW2, when several german PoWs from the Region, upon returning home, had stated that they had been questioned by a Soviet Officer with a bavarian accent while in captivity, that claimed to have been Gabriel, especially since some of the original witnesses claimed that Karl stated he would flee to russia after the murders. Since his Comrades from WW1 insisted that he had been killed however, the police dropped this lead.\n\n\\-Lorenz Schlittenbauer:\n\nThe Mayor of the nearby village of Gröbern, he had been suspected to be the Father of Viktorias youngest child, and to have killed the family to avoid paying child-support. His house was the closest to the farm, theoratically allowing him to spy on it and go back and forth between them without anyone noticing. More importantly, he was among the three people that discovered the Corpses. While the others two were still shocked about the 4 dead bodies in the Barn, Lorenz already went into the main house and audibly unlocked the main door. He claimed that the key had been in the lock, despite the family reporting the only key missing just a day before the murder. Even years later he was suspected because during speculations in the Tavern about the murder, he would sometimes refer to the murderer from as \"I\" and make other cryptic comments. But no direct evidence was found.\n\n\\- Josef Bärtl:\n\nA former Baker, Bärtl had been diagnosed with mental illnesses and been put in a mental assylum, but fled from there on year earlier. Since he was suspected of having taken part in another murder in 1919 and several witnesses claimed to have seen him, he became a prime suspect, but the police was never able to find him.\n\n\\- Brothers Gump:\n\nAnton Gump, and three others had already been on the arrest-list of the Police in Munich due to being suspected of being involved in the murder of 9 other Farmers in Silesia during their time in a *Freikorps*, and they were suspected of possibly being responsible for the Murder of the Grubers too, along with Antons Brother Adolf. No evidence against them was found, but Antons & Adolfs Sister testified on her deathbed that her brothers had told her that they had been responsible. That led to the case briefly being reopened in 1951, but ultimately no evidence was found.  \n\n\nThere were also several problems with the Investigation. Only 5 photos of the Place were taken and no further Evidence inside the building secured. Despite one witness stating that they saw an unknown Man firing up the Farms baking-oven and the oven emitting an extremely foul and unusual stench, no investigation was undertaken as to what had been burned in it. The police classified it as a robbery with murder for a long time, despite large sums of money that were placed openly inside the house being left untouched. There was also no deeper investigation into the reasons behind the victims displaying differing degrees of wounds. Viktoria had not only been beaten to death with the farmtool, previously she had also been strangled, while the others were killed just with blows to the head, and the body of Josef being covered after he had been killed. The most egregious discrepancy however was the Farmtool used to kill the family. The original Police-report states that the murderweapon was found by one of three Neighbors that found the bodies, in the stable. However, when the farm was torn down one year after the Murders, the wrecking-crew discovered the actual murder-weapon hidden on the attic, still covered in blood and tufts of hair. Forensics also discovered that a slightly loose screw on the tool found in the attic matched the wounds on the familys head exactly, which begs the question why the police initially claimed another tool was used.",

Like any usually times at the bar a guy reached her and asked if she'll be interested for a drink, she accepted it and spoke for a bit, he was insisting on leaving the bar and hoping, she denied it but the way he was still very insisting put her off and she took her leave and went with her friends. Another week passed by she went to the same bar the guy showed up again, and offered her a drink she denied it. A week passes and this time she hops to try out a new bar around town and to her surprise finds the guy there too and the same asking for a drink routine which she politely declines and asks the guy to stop bothering her. Which he does and this doesn't happen for a couple weeks. \nA month passes by with no signs of him, so she forgets that he existed.\nShe usually goes home pretty drunk so to avoid misplacing her keys she had it snuck under the doormat of her apartment.

They were originally part of another group, but a few decided to take a new route called Hastings Cutoff and split from the rest of the group. This decision ended up being fatal.\n\nThis route had never been used by wagons and handcarts before, and the people had been misinformed about the terrain. They had to clear a path as they went, and this drastically slowed their progress in getting through the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nBy November, the group had reached the Sierra Nevada mountains, but that year there was early snowfall and the group became trapped under feet of snow.\n\nWhat little supplies they had left quickly dwindled, and so they killed their oxen for meat. When the oxen ran out, many resorted to eating cloth from their handcarts, and even the bones of the oxen.\n\nThree rescue groups made the trek from California to rescue the stranded. The first consisted of mostly young children. One adult couldn't bare separation from her daughter and accompanied them, and said daughter was only three years old when she died on their way back.\n\nThe second was all but just three people, and when the third rescue party arrived they found only one man, surrounded by bones and with a bucket of human blood, unable to stop shivering of hypothermia.\n\nOnly 48 of the 87 people survived, and more than half of them had resorted to cannibalism to stay alive. After someone died their body would be labeled with their name, so nobody ate their immediate family, but almost every survivor had to eat human flesh.",

Fast forward about 10 years I’m at a bar with a lot the same friends from that elementary school and we see our art teacher. We were a little tipsy at that point but teach was probably 4 or 5 deep...  teach joined us at our table and we filled her in with what we had been up to all these years.  Im not sure how it happened but at some point teach brought up aliens and and ufos and started saying some crazy shit.\n\nEssentially teach said aliens abducted people that had certain bloodlines so they could study them; Family members had been abducted and the teach personally had a few occurrences of driving long distances and “blacking out” for hour long periods and then regaining consciousness miles away from what they could remember.\n\nI asked her about the abductions but she said she really didn’t like to talk about it. It was honestly one of the most interesting conversations I had and I definitely left the bar a little shocked.\n\nFast forward another 2 years and I’m working out of state visiting a site for my company.  Half way through the week an executive joined us on site to see how things were going. To our delight the exec offered to take us out for lunch that day at a local restaurant.\n\nWhen we got there we were having normal conversations until our exec said he wanted to tell us a weird story that happened to him.  Essentially he said a few months back him and his family were on a road trip at night and he experienced the same blackout on the road that my teacher had described a few years back. The interesting part about it is that he didn’t have an explanation for it and didn’t try to provide one, he just laid the facts out for what they were.  On the inside I was dying to ask him if he thought it was aliens, but since it was an exec I kept my mouth shut.\n\nI really couldn’t work when we got back to the site because I was tripped up on how similar the stories were and I started to do a little investigating.  I remembered that teach had said aliens abducted people that certain blood lines and I also knew that she had come from a certain small country in Europe... then I thought about how unique the execs last name was and did a google search for origin country of that last name...\n\nthis exec’s last name came 100% came from the same small country my teacher was from and that shut gave me the chills.",

This discovery and the many more to come will  put these atrocities front and center for every Canadian and person of the world to come to grips, with a reality that was far darker than was ever made aware through previous attempts from survivors and their kin.

The boat delivered the bomb and then, because it's mission was top secret, it had a loose window to report in for the next training exercise.  Before it arrived, it was sunk by a Japanese sub.  Most of the men made it off the ship, but no rescue occurred because the ship was not expected anywhere for a few days.  So the men treaded water in the middle of the pacific for hours, which for the lucky few became days.  They made circles to stay afloat and used the oil from the ship for sunscreen, but eventually men would become exhausted and the waterlogged floatation devices no longer worked, so they just drifted away and were quickly eaten by sharks.\n\nThe oil irritated the skin, and while the ocean was brutally hot during the day (causing dehydration), it was cold enough at night to cure hypothermia.  Also, the oil was a mild skin irritant, but so was sunburn.  And sharks were a legitimate threat.  Survivors would mention who they would look over and see their buddy floating next to them, put their head down and talk to them, only to glance back and see them being pulled away under water or simply gone without a trace.  Eventually hallucinations and delusions set in\n\nOf the nearly 1,200 men on the ship, only 300 went down with the ship at the initial attack.  The remaining 900 treaded water in the ocean as long as they could.  Only 316 were rescued: 600 drowned.\n\nThe accounts from the survivors were harrowing.  The captain survived, but was overcome with grief and committed suicide in the 1960s, which is a tragically long period to suffer with that guilt (this part is from memory, so I might be misremembering the timeliness, but I know the captain had a life raft and did not have todlo bad a time before he was discovered, but felt tremendous guilt for abandoning everyone in the water, even though he had no idea).\n\nEDIT: to clarify one thing: the Captain did nothing wrong, though he was a scapegoat for the tragedy.

A couple of years went by, and he stopped updating his profile. It was sad, but people move on, and when you are half way around the world friendships can fade. \n\nHowever a couple of years after that I was back in South Africa on holidays, and I asked some mutual friends if they knew where he was so that maybe we could all meet up and catch up on old time. Unfortunately all they knew was that he had moved away around the time he stopped updating his profile and no one knew where he ended up. Another friend and I decided to try and track him down. We ended up getting ahold of his family who were in Kinshasa DRC. They knew that he had planed to go to Angola for a job opportunity but they too had not heard from him in well over a year.\n\nSadly I couldn't stay and continue on the search, but my other friend did. He found that he did indeed make it to Luanda in Angola, and was heading towards a town called Luau near to the Angola/DRC border. However this is where the trail went cold, and he disappeared off the face of the earth.\n\nNo one knows what happened to him. Maybe he fell ill and died and was quickly buried somewhere with no one being informed, maybe he fell victim to foul play, maybe in the vast wilderness he got lost or hurt or whatever. We will never know. We informed his family of what we found, and they were grateful, but they too have reached closure in feeling that he is dead. Unfortunately that is the fate that could befall many itinerant workers, and in many areas of developing countries, there is few resources or will available to make more than a cursory search, if that.\n\nThe point is, it is possible for people to disappear even in this day and age. Usually it is the less fortunate, or itinerant people, or those in areas too remote or undeveloped to have proper social safety nets to help them. We rarely think of the possibly until it effects us or someone we know, but it isn't that hard for us or a loved one to go missing and the ones left behind to never know what happened, and that is a scary thought.",

Green emerged stating \"I just killed them, all are dead\" and proceeded to rape Abeer himself.

            "text": "LONG STORY\n\nI have never shared this story that I can remember. It sometimes gives me nightmares. Maybe if I share it I can let some of it go. It's a very long story. I worked as a temp when I was first out of college, about 30 years ago. As anyone who temps knows, it's a very diverse pool of people you come across as coworkers. \n\nOne co-worker of mine was a woman from another state. I won't mention names or states, so any details are changed for reasons that will be obvious. She was an older lady, and she was missing an eye. She did not have an artificial eye. Just no eye. I'll call her Grace. Grace confided in me one day that she had lost her eye during a carjacking in a major metropolitan city. She had been shot three times and raped, she said. Her husband was in \"the military\" and was overseas in combat. He would be coming home from his tour and retiring after this tour.\n\nShe regularly sent him care packages of personal supplies and food. She had an adult daughter, but her daughter was estranged and she didn't get to speak to her often. Grace was always lecturing me to \"call your mom, it means a lot\". \n\nShe bought a new SUV when her husband's military pay came, he had told her to get one as soon as it came in. It was pretty nice, nicer than any vehicle I ever could afford. I visited her house a couple of times. She had a large parrot that talked. She said it missed her husband terribly, and sometimes when she let it out of it's cage she would tease him and say \"Where's papa?\" and the bird would go looking around for him. \n\nAlthough she was a little odd, I figured I would be too if the things that had happened to her had happened to me. But some of the things she said sometimes threw me off a little, and I started getting some \"spidey sense\" feelings once in a while. \n\nOne day I was reading the news online, and there was an article about an inmate at the state corrections prison who was suing the state for \"maltreatment\". I think I read it three or four times because something seemed familiar to me about the name. \n\nAt first I thought maybe I had heard about the story before. But when I got to work the next day, it struck me that the name was Grace's husband's name. It was a fairly unusual name. I kept it to myself though, because who knows, there could be more than one person by that name. But it kept bugging me. \n\nOne day near the holidays, she said he was coming home for leave and she was excited to see him. She would have to drive far upstate to the base he was stationed from. I was so glad for her, and it seemed like the person in the paper was someone else entirely.\n\nAfter the holidays, he went back to the middle east. Things went back to normal. But Grace started getting really stress-y saying he might have to stay after this tour as well. They needed the money, because temping wasn't making enough. And the military offers a lot to stay in. She was hoping he would not have to.\n\nShe began giving me gifts, both of food and trinkets. I usually have a suspicion of gifts and I associate them with someone trying to make up for something. I know, it's a pessimistic outlook, but it's rooted in my childhood. Anyway, it made my senses tingle again. I started turning down the gifts at one point. I also did not feel comfortable visiting her anymore. She just began to unsettle me.\n\nAs spring came, I was reading the news and I saw the follow-up for the story about the prisoner, and I got curious so I looked up the entire lawsuit. He had gotten a six figure settlement, but was still not getting out. The internet was not what it is today, and searching for people online was pretty rudimentary. But court cases were available and came up pretty quickly in a search engine.\n\nAs I read the entire transcript, I was horrified to find out that the man who was suing for maltreatment was a rapist and a child molester. He had been in prison for over twenty years, and his parole was denied because he was listed as \"dangerous and violent\". \n\nAs I browsed the legal site, I came across some of his earlier court proceedings. Apparently, he had years added to his sentence because when one of his victims was about five, his girlfriend had brought her in for visitation and had helped him get away with molesting her in the jail visitation room. He had gotten caught, she somehow escaped criminal charges, but they took the child away.\n\nI still had no proof that this was Grace's husband, but I was so freaked out by the story and had nightmares for several nights in a row about what I had read. And working with Grace became excruciatingly hard. Things that never alarmed me before began actually frightening me. \n\nOne day she left for lunch, and wanted to go somewhere in her vehicle, but I said I brought my lunch and wanted to stay at work. She seemed overly cranky about it. After lunch, I was working for about an hour when I realized she hadn't returned from lunch. Supervisors began asking me if I knew where she went. I said I didn't, but I hoped she hadn't gotten in an accident or something.\n\nAt break time I went for a walk, which I usually went on with Grace. She still was not back. As I went around the corner, she pulled up in the SUV. I told her I was worried something had happened and that the supervisors were asking about her. She was angry and said I should have covered for her better. I was kind of offended. She then told me to get in the vehicle, that she would give me a ride back to work. I told her I would just walk back, it was just around the block for heaven's sake.\n\nShe suddenly yelled at me \"WHY WON'T YOU GET IN THE CAR? JUST GET IN!\". I was like, no thanks, I will meet you back there. When she finally got into the office she sat down and in a low voice said \"Why won't you ride in my car? Why are you refusing to come to my house? I know something is wrong, what is the problem?\". I said there was no problem, what could be the problem? There's no problem. She said \"Oh there is a problem.\" under her breath. \n\nThe supervisor came over and asked to talk to her, and she was let go. She told me I should have covered for her. Not really in my nature unless there is something life or death though. Then she left angry.\n\nThe supervisor saw her yell at me and then they talked to me. They said not to feel bad, they had let her go for other reasons. She had falsified information on her entrance paperwork and it was some serious stuff. I was like, was it about her background? And they said yeah, did you know about her husband? And I said I thought he was overseas. They just shook their heads. I didn't ask, and they didn't tell me any more.\n\nFor years after, even after I married and changed my name and moved all over creation, I still was fearful of her. And the husband. Because it turns out it was him. And he was the one who had shot her. And even though he did that and harmed children, she was still faithful to him. \n\nI kept an eye on his sexual offender status for years. One day, he was paroled. So he was actually out there somewhere. Terrifying. But one year when I searched his status, it said he was no longer registered as an offender because he was deceased. I had never looked Grace up, but when I did I saw she was deceased as well. No clue how either one died, just saw the death notices. \n\nI hope their child or children are ok somewhere. I can't imagine being a close family member to those two. I sometimes wonder what might have happened the day she wanted me to get in her vehicle. Even back then I had read enough true crime to know some possible outcomes.\n\nTLDR: I once had a coworker whose husband shot her in the face, taking her eye, and molested her child and other children, and she stuck by him and built an entire story about him being a soldier overseas, when he was really in prison for violent rape and molestation. Which she had some collaboration in. They are both long deceased.",

The gas cloud emanating from this leak contained nearly 15 metric tons of MIC and spread over the vast and densely populated Bhopal city.\n\nThe gas leak killed at least 4,000 people immediately and caused health complications for at least 50,000 inhabitants with some agencies reporting a figure of 500,000. These health complications have resulted in the death of more than 15,000 people over the last two decades while a large number (estimated at 100,000) still suffers from the effects of the gas leak, with ten people dying every year.\n\nChemicals released during the leakage were deposited in the area around the plant and have continued to seep into the groundwater. Other sources of pollution include leaks from isolation material and residues as the containers used for storing them are slowly wearing out.\n\nTests carried out by UCIL in 1989 showed that soil and water in the Bhopal neighborhood were poisonous to fish and other aquatic life. In 1994, studies indicated that 21% of the UCIL premises were highly contaminated with toxic chemicals. Apart from humans, animals were also affected by the MIC leak: at least 2,000 animals, both wild and domesticated, were found dead\n\n(I copied this from an written essay)",

Death is natural. Sometimes turning off the machines is the right thing. But when your next of kin feels sad about the idea of you dying sometimes something that should have taken a few days will be dragged out for years to come. These patients aren’t happy or enjoying their last few days. They are suffering. \n\nThey beg for more pain killers when they’ve already reached maximum dosage. Sometimes they ask to die and you can’t just let nature take it’s course. This is literally my worst nightmare. I promised my mother if she ever gets that sick I won’t do that to her and I’m sticking to my guns. \n\nSometimes they will stop eating in an attempt to die and then the nurses are forced to stick a tube down their throats to keep them alive. This is in my opinion torture.\n\nPeople don’t do this to your elders please. Don’t make them beg for death.",

This is deep enough that there is no natural light, therefore no plants. Without plants, the ecosystem must sustain itself on marine snow, which is usually scraps of dead animals that were partially eaten nearer to the surface, but the less desirable pieces weren’t touched and sank. The ecosystem this deep is basically all scavengers, with a few small predators.\n\nThe first of the three gators was fully consumed after less than 24 hours, by giant amphipods, large deep-sea invertebrates the size of a a grapefruit.\n\nThe second was consumed more slowly, after 51 days only bones were left. Interestingly, a new species of bone-eating worm was found on the remains.\n\nThe third carcass is the one that gives me chills. When the scientists sent their probe down to look at it, it was gone. Not a trace. There were drag marks on the seabed and the ropes used to hold it in place had been torn apart, but other than that, it was gone.\n\nIn waters this deep, most animals are the size of a cat or smaller. They stay small because food is so scarce. To be big enough to tear through rope, pick up an 80 pound gator, and leave with it, whatever took it must have been an order of magnitude larger than anything that lives that deep. It’s possible it was a shark, but sharks of the estimated size required don’t often live so deep. We still don’t know what took that gator.\n\nEDIT: there’s been a lot of discussion in the comments about different possible culprits. While it’s impossible to say for sure, the most likely species is the sixgill shark, one of the handful of truly large species that lives this deep. Other possible options include the Greenland shark and Magnapinna squid.",

During this period of time he assaulted his daughter several times and had several children with her who grew older over time in this room.

He also regularly punished them by cutting the electricity or not bringing them food. Josef wanted to take care of the children with his wife (Elisabeth's mother, who wasn't aware of the events in her basement), so he'd make Elisabeth write fake letters and then he would pretend he found the babies in their porch. In 2008, when one of Elisabeth's oldest daughter Kerstin fell sick, Josef sent her to a hospital. After a long talk, Josef let Elisabeth go see her daughter at the hospital. The police catched them in the hospital and  interrogated them.

The only place I can find it is in an old book I have, the 1988 Reader's Digest book Facts & Fallacies, in the Fortune and Misfortune chapter. All credit goes to this book, although I paraphrased almost all of what you are about to read. I don't know if this really counts as scary, but here we go.\n\nGeoffrey Prescott was on a hike across the Marra Mountains with two others, Noel Smith and Mik Iadt. While walking along the edge of an extinct volcano, Prescott fell an unknown amount of feet into the crater of the volcano. He laid there unconscious while his companions trekked down to him. Smith and Iadt decided to go for help at a nearby village, but it would take them a week minimum, which Prescott knew was far too long. \n\nWith the temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit and having only a few pints of water, Prescott was certain he would perish before the others returned. During the time he was waiting, a small fire burned up his medical supplies and food, with Prescott having to drag himself away from the blaze. He remained there for two days and nights, and dragged himself further down the crater area, hoping he could find water there. \n\nAt about 10 AM on the 4th day, Iadt miraculously arrived with some medical experts. He had reached the village in only 3 days, and had returned almost immediately via horseback and a Jeep. Prescott was immensely relieved, and drank two quarts of water before being driven to a hospital in a stretcher. At the hospital, they discovered that his injuries consisted of a cracked skull, a broken wrist, several smashed vertebrae, and torn ligaments in his knee, and he had survived all that while on the road to the hospital.\n\nPrescott was inspired to study nursing after this ordeal, and as he said, his own miraculous survival had convinced him to help others to face, and defeat, death.",

Somewhere in the neighborhood of 150 British sailors and military personnel on two ships embarked on a mission to find the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic across to the Pacific through arctic waters. The ships, named HMS Erebus and HMS Terror (two former warships reclassified as ice breakers thanks to their sturdier builds) departed British waters in the 1845 and were never seen again. In subsequent rescue attempts and investigations it was discovered that quite possibly everything that could’ve gone wrong on the expedition did so. \n\nThe weight of the ships with their reinforced hulls and decks designed to fire mortars and cannons off of worked against them as much of the waters crossed were shallow and filled with rocks and icebergs. The the time chosen to launch the expedition occurred at one of the coldest Arctic periods in  recent history, meaning the polar ice and (particularly the pack ice) didn’t melt like usual as the ships became locked in the frozen water and essentially experienced an endless winter for over 4 years. \n\nThe food they stored which was supposed to last for years thanks to the revolutionary new process of canning was bought at the lowest bidder. Much of the food was improperly sealed and spoiled leading to food poisoning and even the ones that were properly sealed and kept intact were riddled with lead thanks to the soldering used to keep the food inside fresh; In conjunction with the lead pipes in the ships the men would’ve been drinking out of for years meant the entire crews of both ships was slowly being infected with all manner of diseases (namely botulism, scurvy and heavy lead poisoning which also affects the mind leading to memory loss, heavy paranoia and general mental deterioration) combined with already present tuberculosis that killed a small number of the crew before departing to the Arctic. \n\nAfter about 2-3 years stuck in the ice, the captain in charge of the voyage John Franklin and many other crew members died in unknown circumstances and the remainder decided to abandon ships and try and hike out together to the nearest trading outpost and Back Fish river in Canada, hundreds of miles away, by loading up their rowboats with supplies and fixing them on sleds to be pulled. All remaining crew perished on that journey. Their remains discovered by local Inuits/Netsilik tribes, who described desolate campsites of skeleton-like corpses with hazily built, half-open tents and even human body parts in cook pots, heavily implying that the men resorted to cannibalism in their last desperate hours.",

            "text": "*The Blue Hole is a 100-meter-deep sinkhole on the coast of the Red Sea, five miles north of Dahab, Egypt. Its nickname is the “divers’ cemetery”. Divers in Dahab say 200 died in recent years. Many of those who died were attempting to swim under the arch...*\n\nMany certified scuba divers think they are capable of just going a little deeper, but they don’t know that there are special gas mixtures, buoyancy equipment and training required for just another few meters of depth.\n\nImagine this: you take your PADI open water diving course and you learn your dive charts, buy all your own gear and become familiar with it. Compared to the average person on the street, you’re an expert now. You go diving on coral reefs, a few shipwrecks and even catch lobster in New England. You go to visit a deep spot like this and you’re having a great time. You see something just in front of you - this beautiful cave with sunlight streaming through - and you decide to swim just a little closer. You’re not going to go inside it, you know better than that, but you just want a closer look. If your dive computer starts beeping, you’ll head back up.\n\nSo you swim a little closer and it’s breathtaking. You are enjoying the view and just floating there taking it all in. You hear a clanging sound - it’s your dive master rapping the butt of his knife on his tank to get someone’s attention. You look up to see what he wants, but after staring into the darkness for the last minute, the sunlight streaming down is blinding. You turn away and reach to check your dive computer, but it’s a little awkward for some reason, and you twist your shoulder and pull it towards you. It’s beeping and the screen is flashing GO UP. You stare at it for a few seconds, trying to make out the depth and tank level between the flashing words. The numbers won’t stay still. It’s really annoying, and your brain isn’t getting the info you want at a glance. So you let it fall back to your left shoulder, turn towards the light and head up.\n\n*The problem is that the blue hole is bigger than anything you’ve ever dove before, and the crystal clear water provides a visibility that is 10x what you’re used to in the dark waters of St Lawrence where you usually dive. What you don’t realize is that when you swam down a little farther to get a closer look, thinking it was just 30 or 40 feet more, you actually swam almost twice that because the vast scale of things messed up your sense of distance. And while you were looking at the archway you didn’t have any nearby reference point in your vision. More depth = more pressure, and your BCD, the air-filled jacket that you use to control your buoyancy, was compressed a little. You were slowly sinking and had no idea. That’s when the dive master began banging his tank and you looked up. This only served to blind you for a moment and distract your sense of motion and position even more. Your dive computer wasn’t sticking out on your chest below your shoulder when you reached for it because your BCD was shrinking. You turned your body sideways while twisting and reaching for it. The ten seconds spent fumbling for it and staring at the screen brought you deeper and you began to accelerate with your jacket continuing to shrink. The reason that you didn’t hear the beeping at first and that it took so long to make out the depth between the flashing words was the nitrogen narcosis. You have been getting depth drunk. And the numbers wouldn’t stay still because* ***you are still sinking***\\*.\\*\n\nYou swim towards the light but the current is pulling you sideways. Your brain is hurting, straining for no reason, and the blue hole seems like it’s gotten narrower, and the light rays above you are going at a funny angle. You kick harder just to keep going up, toward the light, despite this damn current that wants to push you into the wall. Your computer is beeping incessantly and it feels like you’re swimming through mud. Fuck this, you grab the fill button on your jacket and squeeze it. You’re not supposed to use your jacket to ascend, as you know that it will expand as the pressure drops and you will need to carefully bleed off air to avoid shooting up to the surface, but you don’t care about that anymore. Shooting up to the surface is exactly what you want right now, and you’ll deal with bleeding air off and making depth stops when you’re back up with the rest of your group.\n\nThe sound of air rushing into your BCD fills your ears, but nothing’s happening. Something doesn’t sound right, like the air isn’t filling fast enough. You look down at your jacket, searching for whatever the trouble might be when *FWUNK* you bump right into the side of the giant sinkhole. What the hell?? Why is the current pulling me sideways? Why is there even a current in an empty hole in the middle of the ocean?? You keep holding the button. INFLATE! GODDAM IT INFLATE!!\n\nYour computer is now making a frantic screeching sound that you’ve never heard before. You notice that you’ve been breathing heavily - it’s a sign of stress - and the sound of air rushing into your jacket is getting weaker.\n\n*Every 10m of water adds another 1 atmosphere of pressure. Your tank has enough air for you to spend an hour at 10m (2atm) and to refill your BCD more than a hundred times. Each additional 20m of depth cuts this time in half. This assumes that you are calm, controlling your breathing, and using your muscles slowly with intention. If you panic, begin breathing quickly and move rapidly, this cuts your time in half again. You’re certified to 20m, and you’ve gone briefly down to 30m on some shipwrecks before. So you were comfortable swimming to 25m to look at the arch. While you were looking at it, you sank to 40m, and while you messed around looking for your dive master and then the computer, you sank to 60m. 6 atmospheres of pressure. You have only 10 minutes of air at this depth. When you swam for the surface, you had become disoriented from twisting around and then looking at your gear and you were now right in front of the archway. You swam into the archway thinking it was the surface, that’s why the Blue Hole looked smaller now. There is no current pulling you sideways, you are continuing to sink to the bottom of the arch. When you hit the bottom and started to inflate your BCD, you were now over 90m. You will go through a full tank of air in only a couple of minutes at this depth. Panicking like this, you’re down to seconds. There’s enough air to inflate your BCD, but it will take over a minute to fill, and it doesn’t matter, because that would only pull you into to the top of the arch, and you will drown before you get there.*\n\nHolding the inflate button you kick as hard as you can for the light. Your muscles are screaming, your brain is screaming, and it’s getting harder and harder to suck each panicked breath out of your regulator. In a final fit of rage and frustration you scream into your useless reg, darkness squeezing into the corners of your vision.\n\n*4 minutes. That’s how long your dive lasted. You died in clear water on a sunny day in only 4 minutes.*\n\n\\[credit to [https://www.reddit.com/user/\\_Neoshade\\_/](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Neoshade_/) for this awesome and terrifying write-up about the Blue Hole -- it's something I'll never forget\\]",

Lorraine became ill and finally landed on her deathbed. and there, she finally confessed to the truth, and told everyone what she had done. i guess she was worried about the state of her soul. \n\n57 years had passed since the murder. 16 since my great grandfather had passed. he never knew the truth. no documents were ever officially amended to state that she was the murderer, as far as i know. the authorities consider the case cold, still, almost 100 years later. \n\nit drives me nuts that my grandmother ALWAYS KNEW! and even after she was an adult, people just said oh, you had an active imagination as a child. there’s no way. to live with that knowledge for so long... and have no one in the world on your side. your whole family against you. that’s what scares me.",

He saw a dad holding his daughter crying his eyes out while the back of the girls head was broken open with her brain on the ground next to her.\n\nThe last was a 9ish year old girl who went to find her mom after it happened (there was a PTA meeting going on at the time so there was a lot of parents at the scene) her mom was freaking out trying to find her but didn't even recognize her.

He and his accomplice, a 70 year old woman called Annah, used to drug and kill young women who came to the shop. Eventually one of the victims' parents traced her movements to the shop, and after the remains of 36 mutilated corpses were discovered nearby Mesfewi and Annah were questioned - and tortured.\n\nAnnah didn't survive, but Mesfewi confessed to murdering them, usually for a tiny amount of money. His initial sentence was crucifixion - a very unusual punishment even then. However there were many protests from powerful foreign embassies, and Morocco couldn't do much against them. Instead he was sentenced to beheading, a more common punishment. However the mood in Marrakech was that this was far too lenient, so they settled on immurement - being walled up alive.\n\nA special cell was constructed in the wall of the bazaar, about 2 X 2 X 6 feet. Chains were attached to one wall to ensure he would be kept standing. Mesfewi wasn't told of his fate until the morning of his execution - when he was led, screaming, in chains and slowly bricked up inside. Once the last course had been laid the crowd would fall silent until he started screaming, when they would cheer.\n\nHe screamed nearly constantly for two days. On the third day he fell silent.",

After this, the couples were loaded into a car, taken down the road to a field, shot in the back of the head, run over with a car, and left for dead.

This is not scary, but disturbing and makes me goddamn angry. \n\nThere was a woman in my city, who gave birth to five babies in span of eight years. Meaning there is five separate cases. She had concealed first four pregnancies from her family and friends. Last pregnancy was noticed by father of the baby and some family members, but she lied about having miscarriage. \n\nActually she gave birth to the babies at her home. Instead of taking them to the hospital, she killed them. I am not sure if if some were born dead or if she just did not provide the babies care they needed. It seems she did not use brutal physical violence. When teeth of the infants was inspected, it was determined they had lived from one to four days. \n\nThe case started to unravel when someone complained about foul smell in the basement of apartment building. When police came to investigate, they found badly decomposed bodies of five infants. The cause of dead could not been determined, because the bodies were so degraded. It was stated in the court documents that she gave birth in bathroom, stuffed the babies to plastic bags and hid them to various containers she happened to have around. She repeated this in every five births. \n\nWhat makes the case even sicker, is the fact that she moved with the corpses three times, adding more corpses to her collection as the time went by. Earlier she had them in freezer, but after the latest move she just hid the bodies to the basement. She was described to be patholocigal liar by her close family member, so everything se says needs to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nIt was determined she was mentally sane and understood what she was doing. She got 13 years in prison, meaning as a first timer she'll serve about half of that time if she behaves half-decently.",

The case is unsolved, despite there being literal photographic evidence of the suspect, and there's an entire documentary and subreddit (r/delphimurders) about it. \n\nA close runner-up is the disappearance of Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon. In 2014 (again!), these two Dutch girls went on a service trip to a village in Panama. One afternoon, they went out on a hike in the jungle and never returned. The scariest part (again), is that later on several pictures were discovered on their cell phones; they start out normal enough, and then there's suddenly several pictures taken in the dead of night deep in the Panamanian forest. It's super eery to think what might have caused one of them to take a picture (with flash!) at night. Trying to scare off an animal? A human? Trying to mark their location for later?\n\nAny disappearance is freaky enough, but the fact that both these cases include photos of what were the victims' final moments just fucks with me.",

I’m going to tell you, in detail, why you have been kidnapped, what’s going to happen to you and how long you’ll be here. I don’t know the details of your capture, because this tape is being created July 23rd,1993 as a general advisory tape for future female captives. The information I’m going to give you is based on my experience dealing with captives over a period of several years. If, at a future date, there are any major changes in our procedures, the tape will be upgraded. Now, you are obviously here against your will, totally helpless, don’t know where you’re at, don’t know what’s gonna happen to you. You’re very scared or very pissed off. I’m sure that you’ve already tried to get your wrists and ankles loose, and know you can’t. Now you’re just waiting to see what’s gonna happen next.

They were found struck dead. The perpetrator lived with the 6 corpses of their victims for 3 days. The murders are considered one of the most gruesome and puzzling unsolved crimes in German history.  \n  \nStrange things began to occur in and around Hinterkaifeck sometime shortly before the attack. Six months before the attack, the family maid quit. It has been widely claimed that her reason for leaving was that she had heard strange sounds in the attic and believed the house to be haunted. Andreas Gruber found a strange newspaper from Munich on the property in March 1922. He could not remember buying it and initially believed that the postman had lost the newspaper.[3] This was not the case, however, as no one in the vicinity subscribed to the paper.[4] Just days before the murders, Gruber told neighbours he discovered tracks in the fresh snow that led from the forest to a broken door lock in the farm's machine room.[3]\n\nLater during the night they heard footsteps in the attic, but Gruber found no one when he searched the building. Although he told several people about these alleged observations, he refused to accept help and the details went unreported to the police.[3] According to a school friend of the seven-year-old Cäzilia Gabriel, the young girl reported that her mother Viktoria had fled the farm the night before the act after a violent quarrel and only hours later had been found in the forest.[5]\n\nMarch 31 – April 1, 1922\nOn the afternoon of March 31, 1922, a Friday, the new maid, Maria Baumgartner, arrived at the farm. Maria's sister had escorted her there and left the farm after a short stay.[3] She was most likely the last person to see the inhabitants alive. It appears that in the late evening, Viktoria Gabriel, her seven-year-old daughter Cäzilia, and her parents Andreas and Cäzilia, were lured to the family barn through the stable, where they were murdered, one at a time.[3] The perpetrator (or perpetrators) used a mattock belonging to the family farm and killed the family with blows to the head. The perpetrator moved into the living quarters, where - with the same murder weapon - he killed Josef, sleeping in his bassinet, and Baumgartner, in her bedchamber.[6]\n\nDiscovery\nFour days passed between the murders and the discovery of the bodies. On April 1, coffee sellers Hans Schirovsky and Eduard Schirovsky arrived in Hinterkaifeck to take an order. When no one responded to the knocks on the door and the window, they walked around the yard but found no one. They only noticed that the gate to the machine house was open before they decided to leave.[7] Cäzilia Gabriel was absent without excuse for the next few days of school and the family failed to show up for Sunday worship.[6]\n\nAssembler Albert Hofner went to Hinterkaifeck on April 4 to repair the engine of the food chopper. He stated that he had not seen any of the family and had heard nothing but the sounds of the farm animals and the dog inside the barn. After waiting for an hour, he decided to start his repair, which he completed in roughly 4.5 hours.[3]\n\nAround 3:30 PM, Lorenz Schlittenbauer sent his son Johann (16) and stepson Josef (9) to Hinterkaifeck to see if they could make contact with the family. When they reported that they did not see anyone, Schlittenbauer headed to the farm the same day with Michael Pöll and Jakob Sigl.[6] Entering the barn, they found the bodies of Andreas Gruber, his wife Cäzilia Gruber, his daughter Viktoria Gabriel, and his granddaughter Cäzilia, murdered in the barn. Shortly after, they found the chamber maid, Maria Baumgartner, and the youngest family member, Viktoria's son Josef, murdered in the home.[6]",

The people who kidnapped her and tortured her pleaded guilty to \"committing bodily injury that resulted in death\" rather than murder and recieved 5-9, 5-7, and 8 years in prison with the main abuser/kidnapper getting 20 years in prison. Their sentences were way too minimal for the things they did to her.\n\nIf you would like to read more on what happened & the graphic things they did to her then you can read the wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Junko_Furuta).

They thought he had weapons due to something he said and they told the police who didn't find anything. One day when dad and son were out fixing a car or gardening and mum and daughter were inside he came with a shotgun and killed the dad and son on the drive, the mum in her room, the daughter ran out into the hallway and he shot her and she passed out but didn't die. IIRC she woke up in hospital to find out she was paralysed and needed a wheelchair and that her family were dead.\n\nLater on after he was released from prison (for some reason) and it turned out the council had put him in a house very close to where she was living with her partner and they had to move to get away from him.

When she left the hospital, she moved into a trailer with her parents and her uncle, Steven Lopez. Also living in the small trailer was two other children and three other adults. As soon as Brianna entered the home, she became the victim to unimaginable abuse.\n\nAs soon as she entered the house, she was abused. It started off with shouting combined with slaps and pinches when she would cry but this quickly escalated. Soon, she was being kicked, punched, and thrown about the home. She would cry out in pain but instead of helping, Stephanie would ignore her while her father and uncle would laugh. When she was fed up of the crying, Stephanie would bite and pinch her, but most of the torture was inflicted by her Andy and Steven who began to rape and sodomise Brianna when she was just a few weeks old.\n\nThe torment finally ended for Brianna, who had endured pain and suffering everyday of her short life, on 18 July, 2002. Her parents and uncle got drunk inside the trailer. Stephanie claimed she had a few beers and headed to bed. At some point during the night, Andy and Steven decided to play a game with little Brianna in which they would toss her up in the air so that she would hit the ceiling and then let her fall to the floor. They explained to police that Brianna would scream and cry during this, to which they would just laugh and carry on.\n\nThe following morning, Stephanie awoke and found Brianna crying, which wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. She also noticed fresh cuts and bruises but chose to ignore it. At a later time in the morning, Andy volunteered to change her diaper and when doing so, he wrapped a baby wipe around his finger and molested little Brianna. It was evident that Brianna was on the verge of death yet nobody bothered to call an ambulance or even show her a little bit of care or compassion. Finally, an ambulance was called and Stephanie claimed that Brianna had fallen from a high chair. She was declared dead at 11:10AM at the tender age of 5 months and 5 days.\n\nMedical examiners reported that her little body was riddled with bruises and injuries which indicated prolonged abuse. She had broken ribs, broken legs, broken arms, bleeding on the brain and vaginal and anus lacerations. Brianna was tortured every single day of her life and died without knowing love, care or compassion.”\n\nhttps://morbidology.com/the-ultimate-betrayal-brianna-lopez/\n\nLooks like her mother was released from prison late last year.",

One day, when I was about 16 or 17, I was walking by the river going to the \"city\". I saw a little canoe right in the middle of the river going a lot slower than the actual current of the river, like something heavy was slowing it down. I thought of doing something nice, so decided to swim to it, use it to cross to the other side to get to the city quicker and then just leave it by the shore for the owner to hopefully find it. Got to it, barely  climed into it. Tried to use the paddles to take it to the shore, but it was so heavy and barely moved. Looked to the other side and noticed that the fishing net was actually dropped into the water as if someone was fishing. Back there, our fishing nets are different from what I have seen here in the west, ours were about 5 yards high and at least 200 yards long, anyway, it is weird, but I thought why not just pull the net and see what it is stuck on, hopefully that that would help make the canoe lighter. So, I started pulling the net, kept pulling and pulling until something popped up then disappeared. It was really heavy. Pulled it hard and then two human feet popped out. At this moment, I think I almost shit my pants. I then let them go, took a deep breath and pulled them back up. I was freaking out but held on the net with the human body tangled into it. Managed to pull the whole body towards me, flip it around and get the head close to the edge of the canoe and held on to it until I got some help or something. It was an older man with a deep whole on the top of his head where I can literally see his brain. It was like as if he was shot by a 50 caliber straight down the top of his head. The scene was absolutely horrific, especially for a teenager. There were a couple of adults on the other side of the river, I screamed at them for help. They had boats with engines to them, so they came to check on me and saw what I found. They saw the state I was in, one of them took me to the shore and the other one took over. I went on with my day and left them with the body. Later on that week, I got the news that police was called and the body was taken to the hospital. Turned out it was an older fisherman who was fishing during the night. There were high voltage powerlines that cross the river in multiple areas in our town. He happened to be fishing when the river's water was higher than normal due to rain, so the surface of the water was really close to those powerlines. The poor man hit one of those lines with his head while wet and got fried instantly. His family had been looking for him for about a week then.",

After playing music with the school's marching band at the Wayne County Fair, she decided to walk home since she didn't live very far.  However, Joel Yockey, who had been released from prison six months prior on rape charges, abducted the girl.  The Jacksons, who lived close to Yockey, were not notified of his sex offender status by the sheriff, as the law for such did not yet exist.  During the time that she was in Yockey's possession, she was raped and eventually dismembered.  Over the next few days, her head and limbs were found in the Shreve Swamps, roughly 11.5 miles away.  Her torso was only found two months later in November after Yockey revealed its location to law enforcement.  Yockey ended up dying in prison on February 15, 2007 due to a blood infection from a torn bowel.\n\nWe still have a portrait of Kristen hanging above the entrance of our band room, right next to the instruments that she played.

After swimming a while, the kid had to use the bathroom, and the father let his son go in (the kid was maybe 6-7 YO at the time. After the kid was in the locker room for like 5 mins, the dad went to go check to make sure his son was ok. He goes into the locker room, all the lights are off. Only emergency lights are on. He walks over to the bathroom section of the locker room and calls his son’s name. He hears commotion in one of the stalls, but doesn’t get a reply.

So I was talking to the neighbors and they heard the steps through the floor so I wasn't going crazy. I told my mom and she did believe me but wasn't too worried it was just a spirit she thought so there wasn't too much to fear. So I bought a digital camera one night as I was watching TV I could clearly hear these foot steps over the TV so I grabbed my brand new digital camera that was beside me just for this occasion so I snapped a bunch of pictures in this same area (don't have the pics unfortunately) but I did a series of pics and in 3 of them there was a purple mist like 2 feet away from me so it proved My hunch I was happy. So as I lay there watching TV it is about 245 am and the steps are still doing their rounds I got over that but than the weirdest scariest thing happened.  I was watching TV in the pitch black living room and the TV shuts off than turns back on and there was a flaming skull with a black vision of hell behind it on the TV for a good minute than the TV switched back to the show I was watching it was terrifying the image of this skull is still burned into my skull",

His victims were his own children, fathered by incestuous relationships with his daughters and nieces, as well as the children by his wife.He has been described as the worst mass murderer of Fresno, California.[\n\nSebhrenah April Wesson (age 25)\n\nElizabeth Breahi Kina Wesson (age 17)\n\nIllabelle Carrie Wesson (age 8)\n\nAviv Dominique Wesson (age 7)\n\nJohnathon St Charles Wesson (age 7)\n\nEthan St Laurent Wesson (age 4)\n\nMarshey St Christopher Wesson (age 1) \n\nJeva St Vladensvspry Wesson (age 1)\n\nSedona Vadra Wesson (age 1)\n\n\nMarcus Wesson was born in Kansas, the eldest of four children of Benjamin and Carrie Wesson. He was raised as a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Wesson claimed that his mother was a religious fanatic. His father was an alcoholic and child abuser who abandoned the family when Wesson was a child. By the early 1960s, the family had moved to San Bernardino, California.\n\nAfter dropping out of high school, Wesson joined the Army, serving from 1966 to 1968. Shortly after leaving the military, Wesson moved in with Rosemary Solorio and her children in San Jose, CA. In 1971, Solorio gave birth to Wesson's son. In 1974, Wesson began sexually abusing Solorio's eight-year-old daughter, Elizabeth. Wesson married Elizabeth Solario when she turned 15. Four months later, she gave birth to her first child. Eventually the couple had 10 children together.\n\nOne of Elizabeth's younger sisters left her own seven children with them, claiming to be unable to care for them. Wesson never held a steady job; he lived off welfare, and had his adult children work and give him all of their earnings. In 1989, Wesson was convicted of welfare fraud and perjury. The family often lived in run-down shacks, boats, and vacant houses.\n\nWesson was abusive toward his wife and children. He prevented Elizabeth from participating in the children's upbringing. He homeschooled the children and taught them from his own handwritten Bible that focused on Jesus Christ being a vampire. He told the children that he was God and had them refer to him as \"Master\" or \"Lord\". He taught the children to be prepared for Armageddon and said that the girls were destined to become Wesson's future wives. The girls were not allowed to talk to their male siblings or their mother. Both male and female children were physically abused. Wesson sexually abused two daughters and three nieces, beginning at age eight. Each of the five girls became pregnant as a result.\n\nWesson was convicted of nine counts of first-degree murder on June 17, 2005, and also found guilty on 14 counts of forcible rape and the sexual molestation of seven of his daughters and nieces. Wesson was sentenced to death on June 27, 2005 and is currently in San Quentin State Prison.\n\n\nMy school bus drove passed this man's house every single day.

She would die a couple of days later but the room she was in was a large one, with about 4 beds separated with curtains. The second night we were there a woman arrived and was put in the opposite bed. I was the only one who saw her, she was in her 20s and just beautiful. But she was writhing in pain, bald and with a healing wound on her scalp that had obviously been the result of some surgery, likely brain tumor. Her husband stayed by her side and comforted her as best he could and he broke my heart.\n\nI listened to her wailing for hours before she fell asleep while I held my mothers hand, she had cancer too and was in pain but it was managed with Fentanyl. This other woman was in absolute agony, morphine did nothing. Along with the cries I overheard conversations the husband had with the nursing staff. The woman didn't speak for herself much, she seemed to be struggling with the coordination of it, the focus of it considering the pain and the drugs she was on. Fentanyl is the only thing that gave her relief.\n\nWe had nearly an entire box of Fentanyl patches for my mother that she did not need, but because for legal reasons the facility could not use them, and we could not give them without breaking some serious laws. They were the only two occupants and if during a shortage of Fentanyl suddenly she had it and we didn't... well, it's pretty obvious. We tried to speak to the staff but were told that now that they knew for sure, if it happened they'd have to report it.\n\nI think about my mother's final days often, but I have never thought of them without also remembering that couple. I hope the husband found happiness again, he used to played movies on their laptop and would tell her what was happening on the screen when she couldn't keep her head up. He was lovely with her and I am so glad she had him there.\n\nBetween my mother's battle and the two days I witnessed of that woman's I decided a long time ago that if I develop cancer there is a clear point at which I'm taking my own life.

At the time in the place where she lived was like a T shape. She and her friend lived on opposite sides so they would walk up and then split off. This one day my aunt was walking with her friend and they split off as usual. Then, all of a sudden a black, beat up station wagon pulled up beside my aunt and she saw a man who appeared to be at least in his 40s who was balding and he had a mustache. He asked my aunt if she knew how to get to certain part of town was which I will not reveal for privacy reasons. She didn’t know because she didn’t have any friends that lived there so she told him no. As she was speaking she looked at the guy and realized he was fucking masturbating while he was looking and talking to her. One he noticed she saw what he was doing the creep drove off in the black station wagon. My aunt tried to chase it and get the plate number but she couldn’t and it’s not like she could just pull out a cell phone and take a photo because this was in the 1980s. She ran home and told her mom and her mom demanded that she tell her father. She didn’t want to because she was embarrassed but her mom called her dad anyways. Her dad ended up calling the cops but it was pretty much useless because my aunt didn’t get the plate number. A couple years later when my aunt had a friend on the side of town that the creep asked my aunt if she knew how to get to. She and her friend were riding their bikes when they spotted the same black, beat up station wagon. They chased the car and tried to get the plate but they once again failed.

It’s wintertime and a farmer in southern Germany comes across a set of footprints in the snow leading from the edge of the forest to his barn, but can't see any footprints leading away. A search of the premises turns up nothing. Over the next week or two, odd things begin to happen: the farmer finds an unfamiliar newspaper lying around that neither he nor any of his neighbours bought or have a subscription to. The family also begins hearing footsteps in the attic at night, but when they go to investigate nothing can be found.\n\nThen one Sunday, they fail to show up at church. This is uncharacteristic and the neighbours immediately begin to suspect that something is wrong. When they finally go to check on the family, all of them are found dead: the farmer and his wife, their daughter, the daughter’s two infant children, and a woman employed by the family as a maid. Five of the six were found in the barn and had been murdered in the most brutal way, by being hacked to death with a mattock (an agricultural tool a bit like a pickaxe). One of the babies was found in his cot with his throat slit. The really creepy bit is that the subsequent investigation determined that the murderer stayed in the house for a few days after he had killed them all. Neighbours saw smoke coming from the farmhouse’s chimneys, the animals had been fed and watered, there was freshly cut meat in the pantry, and someone had eaten about three or four days’ worth of bread. No motive was ever discovered and the crime was never solved.",

She became pregnant and he more or less Repunzel’d her, forcing her to live in the Presidential Suite on the top floor. She was even forced to give birth there. After having the baby she eventually lost her mind, escaping to the roof with the baby and plunging to her death with the infant in her arms.\n\nThe hotel was shut down and stayed empty for decades, being remodeled and reopening in the 90’s (I think).\n\nAlmost everyone I know that has worked there has had weird paranormal shit happen to them, including seeing someone dressed as a maid that disappeared or seemed to float through a wall. They say things move around at random sometimes, like the carts the maid’s have will randomly move a few rooms down the hallways. Footsteps have followed people down the halls or in the stairwells. I have heard there are even entire NBA teams that have refused to stay there in the future because of strange happenings there.\n\nThe hotel is the Skirvin in Oklahoma City if anyone is interested",

In 1987, at the age of 17, he raped and murdered a 33 year old pregnant mother of two little kids and then drowned the children in a bathtub. The woman’s husband discovered the bodies of his family when he came home from work. LaPlante was eventually found and sent to prison, but this wasn’t the first family he terrorized. \n\nIn 1986 LaPlante became obsessed with a girl named Annie and began stalking her. Her mother had died of cancer before he began his reign of terror and it was just her, her sister, and their father living in the home. It started with LaPlante calling their house to talk to Annie and pretending to be a neighborhood boy. Eventually he charmed Annie into agreeing to a date with him, but after the date ended she realized she wasn’t interested in a relationship with him. He did not take the rejection well and broke into her home one night. He hid inside a crawl space he found and lived there for two months. \n\nAt some point during this time, Annie and her sister decided to have a seance in an attempt to communicate with their dead mother. They began hearing tapping sounds on the walls, which they thought was their mother’s spirit. At first they were excited, but their excitement soon turned to terror. The tapping became more and more aggressive and only happened when they were home alone and their father was at work. Furniture and objects were moved around mysteriously. They discovered creepy writing on the walls of the house. When they told their father that they thought the house was haunted, he chalked it up to the grief of losing their mother. On one of the nights the girls were home alone, they heard the tapping sounds again coming from Annie’s closet. On their way to investigate, they saw writing on the hallway wall that said “I’m back. Find me if you can”. Understandably freaked out, they ran out of the house to a neighbors home where the neighbor called their father. \n\nWhen he came home he told the girls that there was no ghost in the house and he would go inside and look around to prove it. However, upon entering the house he discovered another creepy message on one of the walls that wasn’t there when the girls ran from the house. As he was looking at the message, he heard a sound.

We had a roommate named Jo Heinzler who was infatuated with my sister, and his best friend Justin Norcut was abnormally infatuated with me. When my sister kicked our roommate out for bringing over 3lbs of marijuana into our home where she had a 2yr old daughter, things became crazy pretty quickly. Jo had apparently took my sister work clothes and left his Nike bag. They were fighting over it, so I tried to be the peace keeper, but they started to threaten my nieces life, so the conversation ended abruptly. Fortunately my niece was not home this day because in less than 10 minutes 4 people showed up at our front door. There were 2 women I didn’t know, and a man I didn’t know, and Justin. My front door was locked, so they busted it in, and literally took it off the frame, ripping the door frame to pieces. I froze in terror, knowing that these people wanted us dead. My sister ran into the bathroom and called the police, and Justin went through the living room busting out 4 front teeth of a friend that was with us. He then went to my sisters room looking for my niece. The other 3 people came right to my room. They proceeded to beat me with the door frame boards containing construction nails, in an effort to permanently scar my face. To this day I still have a multitude of permanent dents in my skull from it. The two girls did this as the strange man pointed a gun at me. My sister yelled out that she called the police, and the two men ran out the door. My sister busted into my room and we fought for our lives until the two women decided to flee. We found out after the incident that their plans were to beat us, rape us, and finally kill us. The worst part is that they got away with it. The police refused to even question Justin because the only person that saw him enter our home was our friend, we only heard him and didn’t know the other people. Our friend was too scared to speak to the police because he also knew Justin, and after knocking his teeth out, Justin told him that if he told anyone about it that he would kill our friend and his entire family. To this day this monster is still out there, as well as his friends Jo who apparently is now married with kids, just living a happy life after trying to have us beat, raped, and murdered.",

The guys were then stranded on one of those little boats a long way off the American coast line. After a while they reached a little island, where some of the crew stayed, but other chose to go to sea again in search of help. \nThey couldn’t find any and after a while had no food anymore so they had to resort to cannibalism. I think one of them even offered himself up. When after a really long time a ship actually found them, it’s said that they looked like skeletons themselves and just kept chewing on the bones. When they tried taking those bones away, the men held onto them like mad.\n\nAnother cannibal story would be the plane crash in Uruguay. At least I think it was there. If ur not familiar, a plane crashed in the snowy mountains and search crews couldn’t find em. Many horrible injuries of course, one man was said to have his guts spilling out and the only thing they could do was push them back in. They had no food left so they started eating their dead, even drying up meat for some jerky. After months I think more and more people died and they only had other humans to eat. At one point also a mountain of snow buried them. \nSome of the men then headed out to find help and they marched a few days in the mountains, did it one time and had to go back, but the second time they actually reached a village. \n\nMore cannibal stories of which I don’t know if it’s true. \nIt’s thought that hänsel and gretel is based on a few actual events. During the 30 years war the people didn’t have anything to eat so they had to get rid of their kids because they would’ve died anyways.

One weekend, the kids were meant to all be visiting family out of town, but one of the kids wasn’t feeling well so he stayed behind with his mom and dad. One of the nights that weekend, a neighborhood dog was acting up and making a ton of noise on their property as it often did. It was barking outside the house near the trash cans while the son who stayed behind tried to get to sleep. \n\nThe father was upset about the dog making so much noise all the time, and decided to put an end to it via shotgun that night. The mother did not approve, and before he was able to get the gun out of their bedroom upstairs they got into an argument about shooting the dog. The mother tried to take the shotgun from the father, which led to her getting shot on accident. She fell to the floor and didn’t move or make any sound, so in a moment of panic/guilt/repentance, the father turned the gun on himself and committed suicide without hesitation. \n\nThe mother was roused when the second shot went off, moments before the child reached the bedroom to check on all of the commotion. The mother told him to run to the neighbors and get help, which he did immediately. The mother then crawled over to the window nearby and shattered it so she could also scream for help. In shattering the window and pulling herself up to yell, she also managed to cut her wrists so badly that she bled out and died before the son returned.\n\nThis story was buried for years in my family, as they were all devoutly catholic (suicide is a huge sin, which would mean the father couldn’t be buried with the rest of the family).

She was allowed to take a few champagne bottles with her as a welcome gift from the owner, so she put them in her backpack. Being creeped out in a new bar by herself late at night, she tried to hurry and certainly must have jostled the bag around a bit. On edge, she goes out into the alleyway to lock up, and POP POP POP. Says she legit almost had a heart attack thinking she was being shot at, turns out the corks on the bottles simply popped from her rushing. \n\n2: the bar restroom is usually pretty busy, but there’s another restroom down in the basement that isn’t accessible to guests, and is usually just used for storage. Wanting to avoid the crowd, my mom chooses to go to the basement to relieve herself, which is normally kept dark as it is seldom used. Being the brave woman she is, she struts right into the bathroom (which has two stalls) and sits down in the dark to go. Immediately she knows somethings off. The atmosphere feels heavy, and she knows she’s not alone. Someone’s in the other stall. Terrified, she finishes as quick as possible, and rushes out back to work, trying to convince herself it’s nothing. Next morning, manager tells her the place was robbed overnight, with no sign of forced entry. The robber had been in the bathroom with my mom. \n\n3: this one haunts me still as it could have changed things dramatically. After closing up one night, my mom heads out back to get to her car, and is just about to unlock it when she’s confronted by a man with a gun. The gun has a long barrel, and the man holding it tells her to get into his car, while pointing it at her. Like a boss, my mom grabs the barrel of the gun, forces it up into the sky, and pulls the trigger, thus expending all of the mans bullets. She then throws herself to the ground so that it will be harder for him to move her, and she immediately starts pleading to be left alone. Freaked out by the twist of events, and his now empty gun, the man gets back in his car and speeds away, and my mom walks away physically unharmed, but mentally scarred. I think about this every once in a while and am freaked out by the fact that had my mom not been so courageous, I likely would not be here today.",

Our other classmates who carried her to the school clinic saw everything that had happened, and went back to our room to start a group prayer. Still, I never believed it until she slept over at my house.   \n\n\nThere were four of us (Ava, Nathan, and Diane) during that sleepover and we stayed at the living room so we could watch movies all night. Three of us slept on the floor with Ava on next to the left sofa Nathan was staying, me in the middle, and Diane on the right. We watched horror movies throughout the night and Nathan fell asleep first. Halfway through the movie marathon, he woke up and asked Ava who was the girl next to Diane and she said I was the one next to her. He shook his head and said \"No, the girl at the edge next to her\". Ava and I were both confused but shrugged it off, thinking he was still half asleep.   \n\n\nThe next morning, Ava and I woke up first and started messing around, looking at old pictures of us on her phone and laughing how we looked possessed in some photos. After saying that, Diane sat up with her head down. We called her to show the dumb photos but she completely ignored us and didn't move an inch. We called her multiple times but she still ignored us and stood up with her head still down. She started walking towards the kitchen while I was still calling her and saw her taking a bunch of knives from the cupboard. I started panicking and slowly walked back to the living room and locked the door. I woke up Nathan and told them what I saw then Diane started banging the door.   \n\n\nBy then we were all screaming and panicking, not knowing what to the with our friend wanting to stab us. After a few minutes that felt like forever, Diane stopped banging the door and screamed, asking for help. Out of panic and worry, I opened the door and immediately hugged her. She kept screaming that there was a woman standing in front her. After she calmed down, I asked her what happened and told us that she was terrified since the night before because the woman was lying next to her and couldn't move out of fear. When she finally fell asleep, the woman wanted to kill us so Diane grabbed us and started running from her, but woke up only to see the same woman standing in front of her and started screaming. When she calmed down, and Ava collected the knives and put it back the cupboard.   \n\n\nThe thing, I saw Diane taking three knives and only found two. I asked her about the third knife but she said she woke up, only holding two knives. It's been years and I haven't found the third knife even after moving out of that old house.",

The experienced trekking group from the Ural Polytechnical Institute, led by Igor Dyatlov, had established a camp on the eastern slopes of Kholat Syakhl. During the night, something caused them to cut their way out of their tent and flee the campsite while inadequately dressed for the heavy snowfall and subzero temperatures.\n\nAfter the group's bodies were discovered, an investigation by Soviet authorities determined that six had died from hypothermia while the other three had been killed by physical trauma. One victim had major skull damage, two had severe chest trauma, and another had a small crack in the skull. Four of the bodies were found lying in running water in a creek, and three of these had soft tissue damage of the head and face – two of the bodies were missing their eyes, one was missing its tongue, and one was missing its eyebrows. The investigation concluded that a \"compelling natural force\" had caused the deaths. Numerous theories have been put forward to account for the unexplained deaths, including animal attacks, hypothermia, avalanche, katabatic winds, infrasound-induced panic, military involvement, or some combination of these.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyatlov_Pass_incident",

            "text": "*THE MURDER OF JUNKO FURUTA*\n\nOn 25 November 1988, Miyano and Minato wandered around Misato with the intention of robbing and raping local women. At 8:30 p.m., they spotted Furuta riding her bike home after she had finished a shift at her job. Under Miyano's orders, Minato kicked Furuta off her bike and fled the scene. Miyano, under the pretense of witnessing the attack by coincidence, approached Furuta and offered to walk her home safely. Furuta, accepting this offer, was unaware that Miyano was leading her to a nearby warehouse, where he revealed his yakuza connections. He raped her in the warehouse and again in a nearby hotel, threatening to kill her. From the hotel, Miyano called Minato and his other friends, Jō Ogura and Yasushi Watanabe, and bragged to them about the rape. Ogura reportedly asked Miyano to keep her in captivity in order to allow numerous people to sexually assault her. The group had a history of gang rape and had recently kidnapped and raped another girl, whom they released afterward.\nAround 3:00 a.m., Miyano took Furuta to a nearby park, where Minato, Ogura, and Watanabe were waiting.They had learned her home address from a notebook in her backpack and told her that they knew where she lived, and that yakuza members would kill her family if she attempted to escape. The four boys overpowered her, took her to a house in the Ayase district of Adachi, and gang-raped her.The house, which was owned by Minato's parents, soon became their regular gang hangout.\nOn 27 November, Furuta's parents contacted the police about her disappearance. To discourage further investigation, the kidnappers forced her to call her mother and say she had run away, but was safe and staying with some friends.They also forced Furuta to stop the police investigation. When Minato's parents were present, Furuta was forced to act as his girlfriend.They dropped this pretense when it became clear that Minato's parents would not report them to the police.The Minatos stated that they did not intervene because they were aware of Miyano's yakuza connections and feared retaliation, and because their own son was increasingly violent toward them.Minato's brother was also aware of the situation, but did nothing to prevent it.\nThe group held Furuta captive in the Minato residence for 40 days, where they repeatedly beat, raped, and tortured her.According to their statements, the four shaved her pubic hair, forced her to dance to music while naked and masturbate in front of them, and left her on the balcony in the middle of the night with little clothing. They inserted objects into her vagina and anus, including a lit match, a metal rod, and a bottle, and force-fed her with large amounts of alcohol, milk and water. She was also forced to smoke multiple cigarettes at once and inhale paint thinner. In one incident, Miyano repeatedly burned Furuta's legs and arms with lighter fluid. By the end of December, Furuta was severely malnourished after being fed only small amounts of food and eventually only milk. Due to her severe injuries and infected burns, she became unable to go to the downstairs toilet, and became confined to the floor of Minato's room in a state of extreme weakness.\nOn 4 January 1989, after losing a game of mahjong, Miyano decided to vent his anger on Furuta. The group kicked and punched her, ignited a candle and dripped hot wax on her face, placed two short candles on her eyelids, and forced her to drink her own urine. After kicking her, she fell onto a stereo unit and collapsed into a fit of convulsions.Since she was bleeding profusely, and pus was emerging from her infected burns, the four boys covered their hands in plastic bags, so that her pus wouldn't get on their hands.They continued to beat her and dropped an iron exercise ball onto her stomach several times. They poured lighter fluid onto her thighs, arms, face, and stomach and set her on fire once again.Furuta allegedly made attempts to put out the fire, but gradually became unresponsive.The attack reportedly lasted two hours. Furuta eventually succumbed to her wounds and died.\nLess than 24 hours after her death, Minato's brother called to tell him that Furuta appeared to be dead. Afraid of being penalized for murder, the group wrapped her body in blankets and shoved her into a travel bag. They then put her body in a 55-gallon (208 liter) drum and filled it with wet concrete. Around 8:00 p.m., they loaded it and eventually disposed the drum into a cement truck in Kōtō, Tokyo.\nOn 23 January 1989, Miyano and Ogura were arrested for the gang-rape of the 19-year-old girl whom they had kidnapped in December. On 29 March, two police officers came to interrogate them, as women's underwear had been found at their addresses. During the interrogation, Miyano believed that one of the officers was aware of his culpability in Furuta's murder. Thinking that Jō Ogura had confessed to the crimes against Furuta, Miyano told the police where to find Furuta's body. The police were initially puzzled by the confession, as they had been referring to the murder of a different woman and her seven-year-old son that had occurred nine days prior to Furuta's abduction. That case remains unsolved to this day.\nThe police found the drum containing Furuta's body the following day. She was identified via fingerprints. On 1 April 1989, Jō Ogura was arrested for a separate sexual assault, and subsequently re-arrested for Furuta's murder. The arrest of Watanabe, Minato, and Minato's brother followed. Several other accomplices who participated in Furuta's abuse were officially identified, including Tetsuo Nakamura and Koichi Ihara, who were charged with rape after their DNA was found on and inside the victim's body.",

After dinner, he prepared some materials to use in leading a church\r\nyouth group the following morning, and then he attempted repair the family’s swimming pool pump before\r\nretiring to bed. The following morning, he awoke to barking dogs and unfamiliar voices from downstairs. As\r\nhe went to investigate what was going on, he was met by a group of police officers who arrested him for the\r\nmurder of his wife (Cartwright, 2004; CNN, 1999).\n\r\nYarmila Falater’s body was found in the family’s pool with 44 stab wounds. A neighbor called the police after\r\nwitnessing Falater standing over his wife’s body before dragging her into the pool. Upon a search of the\r\npremises, police found blood-stained clothes and a bloody knife in the trunk of Falater’s car, and he had blood\r\nstains on his neck.\n\r\nRemarkably, Falater insisted that he had no recollection of hurting his wife in any way. His children and his\r\nwife’s parents all agreed that Falater had an excellent relationship with his wife and they couldn’t think of a\r\nreason that would provide any sort of motive to murder her (Cartwright, 2004).\n\r\nScott Falater had a history of regular episodes of sleepwalking as a child, and he had even behaved violently\r\ntoward his sister once when she tried to prevent him from leaving their home in his pajamas during a\r\nsleepwalking episode. He suffered from no apparent anatomical brain anomalies or psychological disorders. It\r\nappeared that Scott Falater had killed his wife in his sleep, or at least, that is the defense he used when he\r\nwas tried for his wife’s murder (Cartwright, 2004; CNN, 1999). In Falater’s case, a jury found him guilty of first\r\ndegree murder in June of 1999 (CNN, 1999); however, there are other murder cases where the sleepwalking\r\ndefense has been used successfully. As scary as it sounds, many sleep researchers believe that homicidal\r\nsleepwalking is possible in individuals suffering from sleep disorders.",

Long story short, he stopped to take a leak, she got out too, he hit her over the head and tied her up in the back of his van. After repeatedly raping her, he chopped her arms off below the elbows and tossed her naked over an embankment. This was on a poorly traveled highway. She buried her bleeding arms in the dirt to slow the blood loss and climbed up a 30 foot embankment. The first car that came along saw her and sped off (bet they feel bad now). The second one was a honeymooning couple who had taken a wrong turn. They bundled her up and rushed her to the nearest town with a hospital. She survived to identify him and testify against him in court.\n\nHe served an appallingly short sentence. Given only 14 years, he served 8 and was released for \"good behavior.\" This led to stiffer laws for crimes involving torture and prevents early release of these people. After his release, no one would let him live in their towns (odd, right?) so he served out the remainder of his parole on the grounds of San Quentin. He then moved to Florida, where he had family. While there, he got involved with a sex worker named Roxanne Hayes, who he murdered. Mary Vincent testified about her attack, ensuring that he would not get an easy ride this time. He was sentenced to death, but died of cancer in 2001. I hope it was horrible and painful.\n\nMary lives in Washington State, has two grown sons and is an artist. She is a survivor, but she has had so much to deal with; I have no idea how she does it.",

The steps are very old, so I tried My best to be as quiet as I could and I only made 2 steps creak. I saw my pupper on the chair to my right and I slowly went up to her and I whispered her name in her ear and let her smell me so she wouldn't bark at me. She is trained to protect or react to anything/anyone. So I was kinda confused why she was sleeping. By the chair is the baby's room. I herd him make a little noise, but it didn't concern me at all. I went to my left to see the furnace producing it's heat to warm up the house. I looked toward the kitchen and my parents room to find nothing... I slowly went back up stairs and Maggie got out of the chair and shook and made her collar make noise. I went back to my room and went into my bed. As I was trying to go back to sleep, I heard someone downstairs walk to the door, open it, and what it sounded like was that they let the dog out. Then not to long later they opened the door again then it closed. I sounded like the dog ran back inside. Not to long later I heard the baby cry for a few seconds then he stopped. I ended waking up in the morning telling my mom and she said it wasn't her. When I got home I found out that it wasn't my step dad either, and he said I was crazy. They both asked me if I was dreaming, but I KNOW I wasnt... The noise didn’t match up with my dream. I have gotten confused with reality and dreams before, but I know this was real.",

Next thing I know I thought I heard fireworks (it was the week after July 4th), and thought shrapnel was hitting the ground next to me, but there were no flashes or anything. Suddenly, two guys walk up, one holding a revolver and one holding a rifle, screaming their heads off about \"who the fuck drifted their car through here?\"\n\nI had my S.O. and friends with me and didn't know where this situation was headed, so I fessed up on that hoping it would be less dangerous for them. The older guy with the revolver fires another shot at my feet, and then goes on a spiel about how he's an FBI agent and has three kids with him who are terrified (at this point I spotted where their tent was, it would have been hard pressed to fit two adults let alone two adults and three kids). He starts saying he has dealt with little assholes like us his whole life, and how he could legally erase me and nothing would come of it.\n\nI had defused the situation apologizing and telling him I thought the campground was empty, and they finally calmed down and left our site, after physically hitting me in the chest a few times with the gun. We started packing up camp, and I could have sworn I heard something out in the water (campground was *right* on a river), but I figured it was probably a deer or something. \n\nWe left and I called the cops. By the time cops got there, these guys had left already, and the cops called back wanting us to come back down there and explain the situation again, and show us where everything happened, and also help them look for the casings from the bullets.\n\nThe cops explained that someone in a truck matching the description of what we saw, ***actually fucking shot somebody a few months prior***, because they refused to leave the nearby natural hotspring in an offshoot off the river. They never caught him. They said they were going to keep somebody on the road, and they figured we would be safe to camp there anyway if we were still wanting to, those guys would be stupid to come back that night. We discussed it and decided to stay anyway.\n\nWe started getting our camp set up again, and within 30 minutes I'm hearing something in the river again. It's unsettling because it's *much* louder than it was before, but the car was right there, so no big deal. Suddenly it speeds up hard, and it was very clear it was coming directly towards our camp. At this point the noise had me thinking bull moose, it was LOUD. We all sprinted back to the car and booked it out of there, \"fuck this place tonight.\"\n\nThere was a good ridge overlooking the water, we easily could get back into the car well before anything made it up that, and I wanted to know what the fuck this thing was. Had my friend shine his flashlight down there.. a fucking cougar is looking back up at me. \"No but really, fuck this place.\" \n\nBefore that night, that campground was my main go-to for years, no problems, loved having that short walk to the natural hotspring and it was usually super empty, but I never went back.",

            "text": "I've mentioned this before in another AskReddit question awhile back.\n\nHere's the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lypi3v/serious_whats_something_creepy_that_has_happened/gpvda4s?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) for that post.\n\nAnd here's what I wrote. The scariest part of my story is I was so close to where it happened.\n\nOur neighbor is notoriously known for having frequent fights, so frequent that almost every night you'd hear them screaming their lungs out at each other. One night I was outside minding my own business and I heard them starting another fight. I rolled my eyes in the first few minutes as it was about the husband being drunk again. \n\nFew more minutes pass they then started throwing stuff around their house. A few more minutes pass I heard the wife ask a question angrily. \"You did what?\" She yelled. Now I just assumed that the husband did something really bad that must've pissed off the wife.\n\nEverything beyond that were more inaudible voices so I didn't exactly see the entire picture of their fight, not until the wife started screaming in fear. She started yelling \"Get away from me!\" and \"Let me go!\" I started to become concerned as the screams continued and thought I should call the cops. But apparently someone did it first, so a police car pulled over in front of their house. I assumed it was a noise complaint from another neighbor.\n\nWhen the police came to inspect the fighting and yelling completely stopped, I thought it was over. A few days later, after I came back from school, I saw 3 police cars in front of their house. I saw the man in cuffs and was arrested. At first I assumed that the wife had reported his husband for domestic violence.\n\nAs I got into our house my parents were looking through the window and I asked them what was going on. My mom said that she heard from a fellow neighbor of ours that the man had murdered his wife and chopped her up. I was completely shocked and also creeped out by the news. More so when our local news on the TV had a report about it, the man had apparently hid the body parts in their washer room and covered it powdered soap.\n\nIt was shocking knowing that I lived next to a psychopath. Although it does make it a good story to tell in a group of friends but it still creeps the shit out of me. I sometimes would imagine if the guy went on a rampage, it was literally the closest I got to a real life horror movie.",

My exes father was in the closet at that time, and was known to \"go into town for supplies\" and be gone for a while but then go find spots to meet up with other men and grab a drink. For some reason, he didn't go into town for this trip, and my ex FIL's types were those that looked like Dahmer. \n\nThere's very little chance that the two of them would have connected and would have been murdered, but being it was the early 90s, exFIL being closeted and in a non-rural Midwestern town, it wasn't COMPLETELY impossible.\n\nBeyond that, my grandmother was a holocaust survivor, while we didn't hear many stores, her wails and crying in her sleep her entire life, as well as when she would be reminded of something from the camps she was in, what went on through hiding.

She seemed strong and even fairly wise, but was mentally very far gone (I would say broken without repair, but I think with enough time, effort, therapy, medication, etc. anyone is able to heal emotionally). I was curious to know what could’ve happened to this woman that could’ve sent her into such a spiral, but definitely was not going to ask her directly. One day, however, she decided to share her story with the other patients in a group therapy session. I do not remember all the details, but essentially, this woman was a former lieutenant in a small town police precinct. She had a wife, whom she had met when she had gotten sober about a decade prior to this story taking place, and would go by her wife’s art supply store every night to pick her up after closing. One night, however, she got a call from her mother who told her that her father was having a heart attack. She told her mother to call an ambulance ASAP and, immediately after, called her wife and told her that she would not be able to pick her up after closing, and had to drive about 45 minutes past her store to go make sure her father was okay. Fast forward to when she gets there, her father is pronounced dead by that time and she stays to console her mother for a bit, before leaving. After some time consoling her mother, she gets a call from the police chief in charge of her precinct telling her that her to come back because her wife had been murdered. Apparently, two men she had arrested on gun and drug charges some time before (she never mentioned the timeline exactly) had come back for revenge and brutally murdered her wife. I’m the same exact night this woman lost her father and the love of her life and she immediately went on a blackout binge for days. It is the most horrifying, shocking, heartbreaking story I have ever seen anyone recount in my life, and the image of this woman as she recounted this traumatic event will be burnt into my mind until the day I die.",

During an air-to-air refueling, it was informed of a fuel leak. The crew took the plane above the sea to burn fuel. However, the leak was much bigger than expected, and thus  they were ordered to return to their home base, the Goldsboro Air Force Base. The plane started shaking rapidly on the way back, as it was slowly breaking apart. The captain ordered the crew to bail out. 3 crew members couldn't, but the rest escaped. One bomb was unintentionally ejected by the plane, and its descent was attested by a parachute as normal. Its parachute later got caught in trees, leaving the bomb dangling a few feet from the ground. It was found later that 3 out of 4 switches of the bomb were activated in the air somehow, and the only thing stopping it from levelling the coast of US was a small, low voltage, switch. The other bomb was buried below the mud due to the impact of the crash and had disintegrated.\n\nThe bomb squad dispatched tried to find the Safe/Arm switch of the bomb as soon as possible.

They were staying with a local family and took that family's dog with them on a hike. Later that day, the dog returned without them.\n\n\n\nA few months later, Lisanne's backpack was found with her and Kris's phones (along with a digital camera they were using, their passports, and some money). A few hours into their hike, both of them started to try to dial 911. After 3 days, one of their phones died. The other's phone had battery for another six days - and it kept getting turned on, but an incorrect PIN was entered.\n\n\nWhen they checked the digital camera, the hike looked normal, then there were photos 7 days after they went missing - 90 photos were taken with the flash on in the middle of the night, which they believe were deep in the jungle. Some of the photos showed twigs, others showed toilet paper, another showed a mirror on a rock, and another showed the back of Kris Kremers head.\n\n\nA boot with a foot inside was found a few months later in a river, followed by 33 bones. Some still had skin attached, while others were bleached.\n\n\nA forensic expert stated there were no marks on the bones.\n\n\n\nThen we have [The disappearance of the Sodder Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodder_children_disappearance)\n\n\nSo, on Christmas Eve 1945, George and Jennie Sodder, along with four of their nine children escaped a house fire. \n\nNow, as some backstory, George fled his homeland (Italy) at 13 with his older brother (His older brother left when George was admitted to the US) and was very tightlipped as to why he left. During WW2, he told people his thoughts about Mussolini (He wasn't a fan) and in October 1945, a life insurance agent visited his home and after George opted not to buy life insurance, he said, \"[your house will go] up in smoke ... and your children are going to be destroyed\" due to his anti-Mussolini comments. Later, a visitor to his home who claimed to be seeking work went to the back of his home and told him that his fuse boxes would \"cause a fire someday\" which confused George, as he had just had his entire house rewired for a new electric stove he had purchased (and the electric company checked the wiring).\n\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Christmas, his sons told him that there was a strange car parked in town, watching the Sodder children going home from school.\n\n\nOn Christmas Eve, one of the older Sodder children surprised her younger siblings with toys that she got at her job. They asked to stay up late to play with their toys. Jennie gave her children permission to stay up as long as their older brothers were awake.\n\n\nAt 12:30 AM on Christmas, Jennie Sodder woke up due to the phone ringing - a woman asked for the name of someone who did not live there, and told her she called a wrong number. She noticed that the lights were still on and that the children did not close the curtains - but she saw that one of her kids was asleep on the couch, so she assumed that the rest went up to the attic to their bedroom.\n\n\nAt 1 AM, Jennie was woken up by an object hitting the roof loudly, then heard it roll off. At 1:30 AM, she woke up and smelled smoke. She saw that George's office was on fire on the side that was near the fuse box. Jennie woke up her husband and all of the children she could. They screamed at the children in the attic to get out - as the stairway to the attic was on fire.\n\n\n\nThey tried to call the fire department, but their telephone did not work. A person driving nearby saw the fire and went to a bar, but could not reach an operator. George and one of his sons went to rescue the children in the attic (He climbed the wall and punched out the window) - but the attic they kept in the yard for getting in and out and the attic was missing. George attempted to get his trucks to the back of the house to try to get into the attic, but both trucks refused to start, despite starting the day before.\n\n\nThe Christmas lights stayed on for a bit during the start of the fire.\n\n\nThe fire department didn't come until the morning. They were unable to find any bones in what was left of the house, despite being able to find parts of the roof and multiple appliances. A coroner's inquest attributed the fire to faulty wiring - but one of the members of the jury? The insurance agent.\n\n\nThe day after the fire, their ladder was found at the bottom of a ditch near their house. They also learned that their telephone line was cut. A man admitted to cutting the line by accident when he was stealing a pulley system from their house - but no record exists of who the man is. Given that Jennie got a phone call at 12:30 AM, the line would've been cut between 12:30 and 1:30 AM.\n\n\nGeorge bulldozed the home a few days after the fire, to start a memorial to his children.\n\n\nA bus driver later claimed he saw people throwing \"balls of fire\" at the house, and during the spring, one of the remaining Sodder children found a small, dark green, rubber-looking ball in the brush near the house.\n\n\nThere were many cases of people claiming to see the Sodder children over time. \n\n\nIn 1949, the parents hired a pathologist to excavate the ruins of the house and a set of vertebrae were found - but they belonged to a body too old to be any of the children and showed no burn marks. \n\n\nThe parents put up a billboard on their property advertising a reward and had pictures of their children on it.\n\n\nIn 1967, they received a photo that looked like one of their sons grown up, along with a letter that said \"Louis Sodder\n\n\nI love brother Frankie\n\n\nIlil boys\n\n\nA90132 [or 35]\"\n\n\n\nGeorge died in 1969, and Jennie died in 1989. The family took the billboard down after Jennie died.\n\n\nThe youngest Sodder child, Sylvia, died in April of this year. Her first memory was her parents getting her out of the house.\n\n\nI mean, most likely they died in a fire... but if they did, who killed the Sodder children? If they were kidnapped... who?",

He drove almost 20 miles before swerving into oncoming traffic intentionally colliding with a sedan. Two occupants of the sedan (a woman and her 4 year old daughter) died upon impact, a third, the woman’s 8 year old daughter survived. My friends uncle was completely unharmed. The crash caused his wife’s head to go flying out of the back of the truck and onto a very busy road. When police arrived he reportedly begged them to shoot him and admitted he’d killed his wife. Later the police found the rest of his wife’s body in her garage along with a suicide note the husband had written before his drive. As far as I know the uncle has never confirmed where he’d been headed but it’s believed he was likely planning to commit suicide by driving to my friends house and provoking an altercation with her dad (presumably by showing him his sister’s decapitated head) in hopes that he would kill him in a fit of rage. At some point while driving it seems he changed his mind and opted for suicide by car wreck instead. I was actually with my friend at her house when the accident took place.

The lady went to an anti-explosives technician in order to help her deactivate the bomb, unfortunately some time later the bomb exploded out of nowhere, presumably in front of her family and the public present in the situation, killing Elvia and the anti-explosives technician that was next to her. \n\nThe news recorded it live but still there are not so many recordings of what happened that day. \n\nYears later, a movie titled PVC-1 would show everything that happened regarding the case of the bomb necklace.

            "text": "Well this story is about me. Two parts.\nFirst part, I was cruising around with my friends one night; we were young and just drinking, driving backroads. We had a sober driver who literally is the worst at directions; my friend Brian really wanted to go to Louisburg lake in the buttfuck of Kansas. So we decided lets do it! Well bad idea. We ended up lost, when we decided to turn around was after we saw three cars pass us without lights on in the dead of night. No other lights on the road. I said lets turn around; the driver Jeremy decided to pull off on a “road”. We drove for a good mile until we saw we were in someone’s driveway. Sign in the gate says Trespassers will be shot on sight, but with no way to turn around he had to venture forward. As we move forward a few hundred yards. Boom white sheets hanging from nooses in trees and skulls on stakes. Fucking House of a 1000 corpses type shit. I said book it! Go go! I saw a person exiting the front door with a shot gun and running. I told J to turn off his lights and he did. At this point we are freaked. So J is again turnt around going the wrong way.. we passed an abandoned strip mall that looked out of a western and then we get to a steep hill. We stopped at the top, to figure out where we were and phones stopped working. All of the sudden our car feels like its falling down hill. Then we again see cars with no lights heading towards us. We booked it again. Saw a sign to a place called Lake Annette so Brian begged for us to stop. At this point we drank more bc of fear and fuck why not. So as we get to the lake, Brian the drunkest out of all of us jumps in. Only to discover the lake was full of thick mud, almost like quick sand. He started to scream and tried to run but quickly fell. He said he felt a hand against his leg and he was stuck. It took two of us to get him out. We were of course being loud cause its been a weird fucking night. Then we start to hear chanting at 3 in the morning. Chanting and rustling. Then we see lights. Not flashlights but like torches. We jumped in the car and fled. We finally found a highway; after 10 mins we got cell service and found out we were in buttfuck MISSOURI. A year later, Im telling my new friend Katelin this story and she is from Cleveland, MO. She told me I am lucky to be alive and we fucked around in a place called the Amurugees (an abandoned indian reservation that cops dont even go to). Apparently the surrounding cities know not to go there because its filled with KKK active members and also is known to have people go missing. The cars not turning on lights is a way for locals to know who is from there and who is not so they know who to follow. She said Kylr Yust told her boyfriend during their tattoo session that the place is great for getting rid of somebody. Flashforward years later, Jessica Runions and Kara Kopetsky is found right on the outskirts of the Amerugees. As for the hand Brian felt in the lake.. apparently it was really a hand.. Lake Annette is where the KKK gather and the lake has been dragged several times and each time cars ended up being pulled from it. \nSecond part\nMy mother and dad started dating in the 80s. My mom lived in downtown KC in an apartment building. Across was a nice man who would help her with her trash and talk to her every now and then. My dad and him even became chummy. Well until one night my Dad went to pick up my Mom. The dude was acting weird, short convos and just being nervous. My dad thought little of it. He went into my moms apartment for a while. They talked and then left to head for dinner. When they got to the car they see neighbor dude come out with a rolled up carpet in tow.  My Dad is a curious man who doesnt fear consequences as much as others would so he went and asked if he needed help. The dude was weird about it but accepted after my dad insisted. Right away my dad could tell the carpet was way too heavy. Backstory during this time dead prostitutes were showing up in Defenbaugh dumpsters around the city. My dad had a bad feeling as he loaded this carpet in this man’s truck. After they were done, they parted ways. My dad told my mom the jist of what he felt was happening and so their date became a stake out. They sat and waited for the dude to come back to his truck and leave. He eventually did and my dad and mom followed him. He dumped this carpet 20 mins away from their apartment. After my dad saw homie left; he went dumpster diving. Saw a foot and blood. He left with my mom and called the police. Apparently her neighbor who worked for Defenbaugh was killing prostitutes and dumping them in dumpsters on his damn route. My mom and dad were in utter shock and disbelief. They were legit “friends” with this guy and he was just killing women right next door. \n\nTLDR: First story: I accidentally ended up in a Rob Zombie town from hell and lived to tell the story.   \nSecond story: My mother lived across from a garbage man who had a passion for slaughtering prostitutes and dumping their bodies in bins along his route and ended on a stake out date with my Dad to discover his real hobby.",

Months after the catastrophe, most of the radiation emitted from the open reactor was concealed by a giant sarcophagus that hundreds of workers and engineers had constructed to block it from direct contact with the air.\n\nA man was sent into the now abandoned facility to take a photo of \"The elephant's foot\". A mass of melted core and fuel rods that had formed into a sort of magma (A non-natural element called corium), and had hardened after cooling down. (It is the physical manifestation of what thousands of workers had been attempting to prevent melt into the basement of the facility and reach the groundwater below).\n\nHe was just told to go into the room where the mass of cooled magma was, and quickly take a photo. He did so and came back alive. He had just unknowingly come into close contact with what is possibly the most radioactive thing that has ever been on this planet.\n\nHe died about 2-3 weeks later from acute radiation poisoning. All for one photo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's another story from Chernobyl.\n\nWhen Chernobyl happened, 3 nuclear technicians were sent into the flooded basement of the facility to manually activate water valves that would cool down the core which was slowly melting towards the groundwater beneath.\n\nTheir flashlights died as they were swimming through. They were not expected to survive because of the extreme amounts of radiation. In basically complete darkness, they used names they found on pipes to know their current locations within the facility, since they knew the place top to bottom.\n\nThey somehow completed their objectives, and walked away without severe radiation poisoning. They prevented the possible contamination of (I believe) the Black Sea and its rivers leading to and away from it, preventing millions of deaths from radioactive water.\n\nOne of them (I also believe) died of cancer recently around the past decade or so.

Clipperton Island is a tiny little atol in the Pacific Ocean, far away from any mainland. At one point a tiny settlement of around 100 people was established there, and it relied on regular shipments from Mexico to survive. But in the early 1900's things were in chaos. The Mexican Revolution interrupted those essential supply shipments, and people started to die. Eventually, after 3 years of no shipments all the adult men on the island died off ... all of them except one. The odd, reclusive lighthouse keeper. When he realized there was nothing standing in his way, he went around and took all weapons he could find on the island. Then he proceeded to inform the 15 surviving women and children that he was now the king and they must serve him. He then would pick out one of the adult women at a time and rape her repeatedly. When he was bored of them, he murdered them and picked the next one. He killed four women before one of them was able to find a way to kill him. Shortly after that, the surviving three adult women and 8 children were rescued.\n\nI cannot even begin to imagine the terror these survivors faced, going through years of hunger and illness watching their families and friends die around them only to be confronted with something even worse.",

The gas hadn't killed them, but it had certainly afflicted them. Their eyes were bloodshot and, well, you know how the phrase \"coughing up your lungs\" means that you're coughing really hard? The chlorine was dissolving their lungs, so they were also literally coughing them up, as well as their blood. They managed to force the Germans to retreat, probably more because they were shitting themselves, and burn the fortress down before they died",

            "text": "Dyatlov Pass is a favourite of mine (1 and 2 February 1959). 10 hikers from Ural Polytechnical Institute went hiking through the Ural mountains. All ten of the group were extremely capable and experienced hikers, so it didn't seem like a problem. 23 year old Igor Dyatlov was the leader of the group and they were Grade-II hikers, going for Grade-III certification (the highest certification in the Soviet Union at the time).  The hikers set up camp on the slops of mountain called Kholat Syakhl, meaning Dead Mountain. \n\nAnyways, the hikers don't send a telegram to the Ural Institute by 18 February (I believe, which was the date which they were supposed to end their trip and let the UPI know). This wasn't too concerning as telegrams can get delayed. However, days went by without a telegram. A search party went out and found the bodies of the nine hikers. There were ten, but Yuri Yudin had to turn back because of illness. The tent was found, slashed from the inside, half covered with snow. None of the hikers were wearing adequate footwear and weren't dressed properly.\n\nUnder a Siberian pine, the first two bodies were found near a small fire. The bodies were naked except for underwear and the pine had branches broken up to five feet, probably signifying that one of them climbed the tree as a vantage point. Halfway between the camp three more corpses were found, including Igor Dyatlov. This small group was thought to be making their way back to the camp. The last four were found 2 months after the other bodies were found. They were found under 4 meters of snow in a 75 meter ravine. Three of the four were better clothed, suggesting that they had taken off clothes from the other bodies. \n\nI'm not going to get into all the theories and injury details, but I do want to point out one thing. Investigators found radiation on their clothes and bodies. It's really weird that investigators would check for radiation when investigating the tragic deaths of nine hikers. Reportedly, a group of hikers 50 km away reported seeing strange orange spheres in sky around that night. Military and meteorological services also claimed to see them. This leads to the theory of bombs being tested near the campsite, which could've startled the hikers and made them rip the tent and flee it quickly.\n\nIt's a famous and mysterious case, with no definite conclusion being drawn.",

Then I walked back and took the trolley to 59 Street at 2 a.m. and walked from there home. Next day about 2 p.m., I took tools, a good heavy cat-o-nine tails. Home made. Short handle. Cut one of my belts in half, slit these halves in six strips about 8 inches long. I whipped his bare behind till the blood ran from his legs. I cut off his ears, nose, slit his mouth from ear to ear. Gouged out his eyes. He was dead then. I stuck the knife in his belly and held my mouth to his body and drank his blood. I picked up four old potato sacks and gathered a pile of stones. Then I cut him up. I had a grip with me. I put his nose, ears and a few slices of his belly in the grip. Then I cut him through the middle of his body. Just below the belly button. Then through his legs about 2 inches below his behind. I put this in my grip with a lot of paper. I cut off the head, feet, arms, hands and the legs below the knee. This I put in sacks weighed with stones, tied the ends and threw them into the pools of slimy water you will see all along the road going to North Beach. I came home with my meat. I had the front of his body I liked best. His monkey and pee wees and a nice little fat behind to roast in the oven and eat. I made a stew out of his ears, nose, pieces of his face and belly. I put onions, carrots, turnips, celery, salt and pepper. It was good. Then I split the cheeks of his behind open, cut off his monkey and pee wees and washed them first. I put strips of bacon on each cheek of his behind and put them in the oven. Then I picked 4 onions and when the meat had roasted about 1/4 hour, I poured about a pint of water over it for gravy and put in the onions. At frequent intervals I basted his behind with a wooden spoon. So the meat would be nice and juicy. In about 2 hours, it was nice and brown, cooked through. I never ate any roast turkey that tasted half as good as his sweet fat little behind did. I ate every bit of the meat in about four days. His little monkey was a sweet as a nut, but his pee-wees I could not chew. Threw them in the toilet.” \n\nAnd this isn’t the worst.

            "text": "This happened to me when I was about 12, more of a near death experience than anything. My dad used to own a number of four wheelers, and a sizable property for me and my siblings to ride them on. We had a sceptic tank in the back that let us get a few moments of air time, and me being a clueless 12 year old, I tried to do a trick in those few moments. I nearly fell off and was only holding on by my hands with the rest of me hanging off the side, which wound up making me turn straight into the side of the house. The four wheeler tried to go up the side for several seconds as I slowly fell backwards off of it and sputtered out. I heard from family afterward that while I was sliding off, my hair was only a few inches away from the spinning axles of the back tires, meaning that if I had fallen in the right way and been just a bit closer to them, there's a very real chance I could have scalped myself in seconds.",

            "text": "This is a long one. Happened in my neighborhood when I was a kid. I’m not the original author.\n\nThe Luna Family\n\nIn recent news, it was announced that Death Row inmate Richard Djerf had been denied his last appeal. Djerf had been convicted of killing four members of the Luna family in Maryvale in 1993. We have discussed this crime on TCiP a few times in bits and pieces, so I decided it was about time to give it its own page here. I had been following this case since it occurred, and have seen some of the crime scene photos. I cannot think of another crime equal in terms of innocent victims, horror and cruelty. Djerf actually plead guilty to four counts of capital murder, his thinking being, “If the judge or jury heard the details, they would give me the death penalty.” I agree.\n\nAlbert and Patricia Luna came from the copper mining region of Clifton-Morenci. They married shortly after high school and intended to make a life in eastern Arizona in the mining industry. A labor strike in 1983-1984 lead to problems and non-union workers being brought in. Albert lost his job to a non-union worker, and found difficulty finding gainful employment. The family decided to leave Clifton and go to Phoenix to find work. Family and friends warned them of the dangers of the big city, but they were out of options and re-established themselves in west Phoenix.\n\nAlbert and Patricia had three children; Albert, Jr, 21, Rochelle, 18, and Damien, 5. Albert Jr had some issues with his new home town, finally being arrested in 1992 for theft and burglary. He also had taken to carrying a gun. Rochelle was a popular, outgoing, girl with a job working the night shift at a grocery store. Albert and Patricia were concerned for her safety, but she insisted on earning money for college. Damien was a typical 5-year-old, and Albert Sr. found steady work and was able to support his family.\n\nAlbert Jr worked as a night custodian at a nearby Safeway store. His co-worker was Richard Djerf. They were friends until January 1993, when Djerf’s apartment was burglarized. A television, a VCR unit, stereo equipment, a car alarm, and an AK-47 assault rifle, were stolen.  Djerf was sure Albert Jr. did it, But Albert denied everything. Djerf stewed and silently raged for months after. Finally, on September 14, 1993, he decided he would take revenge. Albert Jr. would later admit to committing the burglary of Djerf’s apartment.\n\nIn the late morning hours of September 14, 1993, Djerf went to the Luna family home, at 7202 W. Monte Vista Street, taking his 9mm Beretta handgun, a knife, latex gloves, handcuffs, red fuse cord, and artificial flowers in a vase to use as a ruse to gain entry.  When Patricia, answered the door to receive the flowers, Djerf pushed his way into the house, showing her his gun. Djerf took Patricia into the master bedroom and bound her, letting her five-year-old son, Damien, run free.   Later, while holding Damien hostage, Djerf freed Patricia and forced her to place items of property into the Luna family car, including two VCR units, a telephone, a caller ID box, a stereo CD player, four watches, change, and a money clip with food stamps. He then took Patricia and Damien into the kitchen and bound them to chairs, facing each other,  with rope and black electrical tape.  More than once, he asked Patricia whether she or her son should die first. He also asked her if she knew the whereabouts of her son, Albert Jr.\n\nAround 3:00 p.m., Rochelle came home.  Djerf took Rochelle to her bedroom, gagged her with tissue paper and tape, tied her to the bed, cut off, and removed all of her clothing with a knife.  After raping her, Djerf stabbed Rochelle four times in the chest and cut her throat.  At some point while still alive, Rochelle vomited behind the gag and aspirated the vomit.   Djerf then returned to the kitchen and told Patricia he had just raped and killed her daughter.\n\nAround 4:00 p.m., Albert Luna, Sr. arrived home from work. Djerf handcuffed him, forced him to crawl to the master bedroom, and placed him face down on the bed.   He struck Albert in the back of the head multiple times with an aluminum baseball bat, inflicting three large lacerations and spattering blood throughout the room.   Believing Albert to be dead, he removed the handcuffs and taped his hands and wrists together, leaving him on the bed.  He then walked to the kitchen and told Patricia that he had just killed her husband.\n\nDjerf took a light fixture, cut and stripped the wire, and taped it to five-year old Damien’s legs. He flipped the switch but was unable to get the current to kill the little boy. He then tried to snap Damien’s neck, “Like he had seen in the movies.”  Despite twisting the child’s head all the way around, he couldn’t get the neck to break the same way Stallone could.\n\nMeanwhile, in the bedroom, Albert Sr, although badly injured, regained consciousness and freed himself from the tape around his wrists. In an effort to save his family, he went to the kitchen, and charged Djerf with a pocketknife, wounding him seriously. During the ensuing struggle, Albert stabbed Djerf with enough force to drive a knife through his leg.  Djerf managed to pull the Beretta from his belt and shot Albert six times.  Albert fell to the kitchen floor and died at the feet of his wife and son.\n\nDjerf was not content with just killing Patricia’s husband, daughter, and torturing her son, Djerf repeatedly asked Patricia if she wanted to watch her son be killed, or did she want her son to see her be killed. All the time with Albert Sr. lying dead at their feet. Djerf finally grew tired of his game and shot both of them to death. He poured gasoline over the bodies and initially intended to light it with the red fuse cord, but children playing outside made him think he would be spotted when he left. He put a pizza box and a rag on the stove and turned on the burners. After seven hours of rape, torment and butchery, Djerf left the home.\n\nFor some reason, the pizza box and rag failed to ignite the gasoline.   Albert Jr. had not gone to his home the night of September 13, and did not return until 11:45 p.m.   Numerous unanswered calls to the house had made him anxious.  When Albert Jr. entered the home and discovered the bodies of his parents and brother, he immediately left and drove to his girlfriend's house where he called the police.\n\nAfter murdering the Lunas, Djerf went back to his apartment and had his girlfriend, Elizabeth Boswell drive him to the hospital to get the injuries he received from Albert Sr. treated. He initially said he had been stabbed during a robbery attempt, but admitted to her he committed the killings the following day. Djerf told Boswell that he had murdered four members of the Luna family and described to her how he had done it.   He told her that the blood dripping from Patricia's gunshot wound was “really awesome” and “you should have been there.” He also bragged about the killings to two other friends.\n\nOn September 18, Phoenix Police executed search warrants on a motel room and Djerf's car and apartment.   The police found handcuffs, a nine-millimeter Beretta, a stereo CD player, two VCR units, a U.S. West caller ID unit, artificial flowers and a vase, watches, Rochelle's charm necklace, a cardboard knife sheath, Patricia's car keys, a telephone, loose change, food stamps, and a red fuse cord.  Police arrested Djerf later the same day.  At the time of arrest, the police found a handcuff key and a newspaper section containing an article about the killings in his possession.\n\nDjerf tried to act as his own attorney, and ended up taking a plea deal where he plead guilty to four counts of Capital Murder. When the sentence of four Death Penalty’s was announced, he shrugged, “Well, they can only kill me once.” Djerf continued to not show any remorse, saying, \"It was all my fault, all my fault. I'm not crazy. I don't hear voices. I didn't have a terrible childhood. I just did what I did.\" \"Of course, I regret it,\" Djerf said in 1995. \"I wish I'd taken someone with me that day and they'd have talked me out of it.\" On Wednesday, July 24, 2019, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against him and allowed his death sentence to continue.\n\nAlbert Jr. currently lives in Surprise. He is on his second marriage and apparently has had no further run-ins with the law. The Luna family is buried in Clifton, Arizona.",

Her sister stayed with her mom in southern Texas. And she (Aj) moved to Dallas with her dad. \n\nEventually, Aj wanted to introduce me to her dad and family. It was a big deal to her because her dad was very protective of his daughters.

Eventually her mom quit letting Aj visit. And told the girls dad that Aj's sister didn't want to see him anymore and blamed him for leaving their mom. During this time, her mom and stepdad started locking her daughter in a closet.  She ate, slept, and pooped and peed in this closet. She was allowed out to go to school. Meanwhile, Aj's mom had a few more kids with her boyfriend. \n\nEventually nobody could get ahold of Aj's mom. One of Aj's half brothers living with the mom, told the school about their (half) sister being kept in a closet. The authorities couldn't get ahold of Aj's dad, and put the sister in Foster Care until he was located. \n\nThere's more to it. I'm trying not to use names and introduce more people because the story gets longer. But they were basically threatening her life if she ever told the whole story.

Basically what happened was the dude went to basic training and right after he got done with it he was shipped straight to Iraq. At the time the military had clear instructions which basically read as “if you see this, mow it down, if you see this mow it down ” etc with no questions. So immediately after basic, the dude found himself killing kids day after day. So after he was finished and the military was processing him out to go back home he started dealing meth and clearly was not the same person anymore. Once he got back home to Texas he basically went off the deep end. Then one random night he drove to his parents, killed them, chopped them up brought their remains to his house and started burning them. He then told his girlfriend what happened and when she threatened to call the cops he tied her up to the bed and taped a .357 magnum in the position aiming at her head and with a string attached to the trigger and one to the doorway. Then he called the police (who were already on their way since they received many calls about the smell of burning flesh in the town) But on the phone with police he stated exactly what he did, where to find him and he said over and over, don’t go through the front door or the girl is going to die. The police went through the front door anyway and she got her head blown off. He was later found guilty and sentenced to death where he asked to get moved to the front of the line so he didn’t have to sit on death row. My manager talked to him before he was executed and basically what the dude said was he didn’t really feel remorse he just wished someone had got to him before he killed them.

It was the place of an estimated fifteen car accidents that had occurred within the past few years.\n\nSo his parents made a right turn and went down a hill. \n\nNext to them was something peculiar.\n\nA man of twenty five or so stuck his head out of the window of his vehicle, creeping up the hill. The car he was driving was mangled. The engine blocked the windshield (which would explain the man looking out the window), the body of the car was bent, and the wheels were wobbling. My dad mentioned that he was surprised the car could even start.\n\nMy grandfather and grandmother were taken aback by the sight of the man and his vehicle. They continued down the hill and made a U-turn to examine what they saw and see if the man needed help. \n\nWhen they went up the hill, there was no sight of the man. And it isn't like he could've gone anywhere. The nearest home with a garage was several blocks away, and the only place he could've gone was in the woods. But why?\n\nThe image of the man was seared in my grandparents' minds. Again, they were non-theistic.

On April 21, 2011 they search again and an officer notices something off with the terrace, she finds the bodies of four children and Mrs. DuPont, along with their two dogs, wrapped in bags with religious icons.... \n\nNo blood, no fingerprints, and no dna were recovered at the scene to identify a killer. The crime is thought to be committed by father / husband after more investigation, it was found that he was essentially bankrupt and rather than face the embarrassment of telling his family he had no money he killed them.\n\nOne of the scariest things about this entire crime was the amount of time it took to actually find the victims, the crime itself, and the oldest child;away at college.... he was called back by his father under the guise of an emergency.

Everyone got along great and we frequently hung out together outside of work. One day, one of our cooks never showed up to his shift. He was such a nice guy, always telling jokes and talking to our regular customers. He was a hard worker, never left until everyone had their closing work done, and would always offer to help, so him not showing up without a call was unusual. The next day we found out that he had been arrested after trying to kidnap an 8 year old girl at a school bus stop. Later, authorities searched his apartment and found nearly 10,000 pictures and videos of CP. He later admitted to raping several young girls in that apartment. That apartment he shared with his roommate who also worked with us, and had no idea. We had all been over there a few times as well to hang out, not knowing at the time what kind of evil happened there by a guy we all knew, liked, and worked with every day.\n\nThis one my mom just told me about a month ago. This family was having some remodeling done in the master bathroom that lasted about 2 weeks. Two of the guys on the remodeling crew would watch the family while they were home and study their routine. They stole a key and made copies. What's crazy is the family never noticed them doing any of this\nThey never were suspicious or felt that the 2 men were acting strange or suspicious. After almost 2 weeks they had a good idea of who would be home and when on a typical weekday. The day after the remodel was finished, their kids had gone off to school and the husband to work. The mom went to get a shower in their newly remodeled bathroom but there was a problem with the water pressure so she went to a shower upstairs. While she was bathing, the 2 guys came back, walked through the front door, found the wife in the shower and they both raped her. They smashed her head into the tile wall of the shower and left her to die. Luckily, their neighbors noticed the men leave the house and were immediately suspicious when they left the front door open, ran into their car and sped away. The woman  thankfully survived, but obviously had some very serious PTSD. They decided to put the house up for sale because they couldn't live there anymore. Just about a year later the house sold, to my parents. I lived there for 14 years and never knew. That shower was my shower. My parents still live there. They didn't tell me and my siblings because we were very young when we moved in, understandably. But I can't believe they didn't tell us when we were older. I was horrified to learn what happened in the shower I used almost every day for so many years. My parents only told us recently because there's been an alarming number of break ins in their neighborhood recently, and it reminded them of that story. I don't know how they could forget!\n\nThere's something so eerie about knowing something horrific and evil happened in a place you were so familiar or comfortable with.",

I could be in the room all day but at night I would freak out and have to be moved to my parents room.

The moment she does she almost falls over and she has to be helped out, after leaving the closet she's completely fine. She described it like the room was spinning around at an extreme speed while this evil presence loomed over you. A few days later my dad calls a guy he calls the Mushroom Man and he does a cleansing of the whole room and the inside of the closet. It works for a little while before the same thing happens again. Can't be in the room at night, my dad asks the whoever runs the place about who used to live there. He was told it was an old woman who was a major schizophrenic who also had dementia. He calls the Mushroom Man again but it doesn't do anything this time. Then he gets a drain snake and gets out absolutely all the hair that's in the drains possible. Right after that it stopped and never happened again.

After a few messages with the ground in which they seemed dazed and confused they went silent and the plane continued on and eventually began circling on autopilot. \n\nAs they could not raise the aircraft on radio a pair of fighters were scrambled to intercept and investigate. They found that the plane was circling with no signs of life in the cabin and the pilots slumped at the controls. \n\nEventually as they watched a lone flight attendant entered into the cockpit and sat at the controls, however they were unable to speak to him on the radio and he seemed unable to communicate. Shortly afterwards the engines ran out of fuel and the plane spiralled down to the ground, crashing on a hillside in Greece. There were 121 people on board.\n\nWhat had happened was that the pressurisation system had been turned off by maintenance to investigate a door problem, and the pilots failed to turn it back on when they ran through three separate checklists. When they radioed asking for help they were already suffering from oxygen deprivation, and in their confusion they were unable to understand advice to check the pressure switch. They passed out soon afterwards and the plane continued on autopilot.\n\nThe scary part is the lone flight attendant. He was Andreas Prodromou, a former special forces soldier and a trained pilot - but one who did *not* know how to fly a 737. Also on board was his girlfriend, who was also a flight attendant for Helios. He managed to remain conscious by using a portable oxygen bottle, and there is evidence that he brought the oxygen bottle to the cockpit and strapped it to the pilots in an attempt to resuscitate them, to no avail. By the time he realized that something was terribly wrong and was able to make it into the cockpit, theu were likely never going to wake up. It was him that tried to take control of the plane just before it ran out of fuel. The cockpit voice recorder also captured him making five separate Mayday calls - to no effect, as he was tuned to the wrong frequency and out of range of the receiver. \n\nTo be the only one conscious on a plane with 120 silent people - including the woman that you love - , knowing that they *might* still be alive and that you're their only hope, head swimming from lack of oxygen and barely able to function as you struggle with the equivalent of being *above* the peak of Mount Everest is utterly horrifying for me. Especially when the engines flamed out and it became apparent that there was no hope.\n\nThe last known action of Prodromou was to turn the plane away from Athens and towards an uninhabited area.",

            "text": "In 1983, the Soviet Union deployed fighter jets and destroyed a Korean Airlines passenger jet which had deviated into Soviet airspace.  Flying from Alaska, the jet's passengers included many Americans and a US congressman.\n\nTwo months later, the US completed the deployment of Pershing missiles into Europe, according to a plan initiated several years earlier.\n\nThroughout the period, US bomber forces were continually probing Soviet air defenses, looking for radar gaps.\n\nLater that very month, September of 1983, a freak alignment between the sun, cloud cover, and Soviet early warning satellites caused a false signature in the Soviet early warning system that was identified as a possible US ICBM launch.  At the time, Soviet ground radars lacked the ability to scan over the horizon to confirm or disprove the satellite warning.  The Soviet officer in their command center was skeptical however, because the number of ICBMs detected seemed too low to indicate a real nuclear attack.\n\nHowever in November,  two months after the shoot-down of KAL 007, a much more dangerous close call occurred.  Operation ABLE ARCHER 83 was a large scale training exercise, simulating a mass mobilization of NATO armies for confrontation with the USSR.  The United States deployed divisions by air transport to Europe in radio silence, mobilized bomber and missile assets, and had Regan, Thatcher, and Kohl participate in simulated command coordination to test new communication links developed for coordinating joint Western operations.  The US, in concert with UK, and German allies, configured its forces to a simulated DEFCON 1 state.\n\nUnable to determine if the Western activity was an attack or an exercise, Soviet forces went to Readiness-3, a 30 minute reaction posture.  NSA intercepts of Soviet air force traffic indicate that Soviet front-line air force units rushing to respond to ABLE ARCHER  requested permission to \"modify [their prescribed weapon loads] due to unforeseen balance problems,\" indicating that weapons being put onto the aircraft had not been used before.  The interpretation is that in the uncertain situation, the Soviets ordered nuclear weapons to be loaded onto the front-line fighter bomber aircraft.  Soviet ICBMs were brought to launch readiness.\n\nThe full scale of the Soviet mobilization was not detected at the time ABLE ARCHER was in progress.\n\nThe US theater commander at the time had some indications from intelligence sources that Soviet posture was elevating somewhat, but decided it did not require any increased preparations by the US.\n\nThe situation diffused after the conclusion of ABLE ARCHER, and the nature of the incident was not fully known until details were revealed by a high-level Soviet defector some time later.",

He had a reputation as being odd, fairly certain he was diagnosed schizophrenic, and lived even further out in the bush than we did. She said they stopped by his place one time and it reeked of death, I think he'd skinned some raccoons or something and had left the hides and/or bodies out in the sun? Something to that effect.   \n\n\nAnyway, one day when Mom's boyfriend was out, Chad stopped by to visit. My mom being the sweet lady she is, invited him in while she cleaned the kitchen and baked, and chatted him up for hours until her boyfriend came home. When her boyfriend came home to find Chad sitting in the kitchen, he pulled quickly her aside, all irritated and worried, and said, \"Don't invite him in when I'm not home.\"   \n\n\nI'm not sure how much time passed after that, maybe a month or two? But one morning, around 10 a.m., there was a knock at our door, it's Chad. He was standing there all anxious and fidgeting when my mom's boyfriend answers the door to him. His hands are behind his back and he's looking around asking for my mom and wanting to know if she's home. My mom's boyfriend lied and said she wasn't there and told him to fuck off. Chad reluctantly  turned around to leave, but not before revealing that he'd been holding a large butcher knife behind his back.   \n\n\nIt terrifies the hell out of me when I think about it.

He's hosed off a burn victim whose polyester sweatpants had melted and fused to the poor sap's skin, keeping cold water on the wound to keep the guy quiet until the ambulance arrived to take him away, whereupon Dad heard the guy's screams echoing off the hills above the sound of the ambulance's siren. He's gone on a nice long road trip with a 17-year-old kid who killed his entire family for the fun of it, and had enlightening discussions about planes and school with the kid as they drove to the same asylum where Gein died. He's seen the body of an old man who'd putrefied in the summer sun after his tractor collapsed on him during a maintenance session.\n\nAnd the only time he's ever been really unsettled and disquieted, according to him, was when he reviewed the images taken of Jeffery Dahmer's freezer, fridge, and shower.",

I was confused about it, as it was always my mum who did, but did not think much on it until half-way through the drive. My dad began to mumble about how sorry he was, and how I would never see him again. More than a bit frightened and confused at that point, I kept asking what he meant, but he wouldn't say. Until we were home, but he did not leave the car, and instead urged me to get out. Finally, he told me I would not see him again because he will be dead very soon for what he did, and that the police would answer me.\n\nAfter he practically kicked me out of the car I rushed home, but no one was there. But I found the door open, and a puddle of blood on the floor.\n\nThe police was nearby and explained what had happened:\n\nMy dad was obsessively jealous and had found a pack of old condoms in the cupboard, so he drew the conclusion that my mum must have cheated on him. Never mind the fact that we only recently moved into this apartment, and they could have been left by previous tenants, or the fact that he controlled my mum's very step and never let her go anywhere alone. The police took me to the hospital, where my mum, luckily alive, was being treated.\n\nMy dad had smashed her skull in with a full wine bottle. The only reason she survived was because my little brother, 7 at the time, intervened. If it weren't for him, my dad would have killed my mum in a fit of jealousy.\n\nWhen he said that I would not see him again, he meant that he had planned on killing himself shortly after dropping me off. He did not succeed, and police managed to get him into a mental ward.\n\nThis, to this date, is the scariest thing that had ever happened to me, but I keep thinking of my brother all the time. To witness your own mum being beaten half-dead by your dad. We both suffered extreme mental trauma from this event later down the line, but somehow turned into decent people. I never really told him how grateful I am he was there, but I think that I really, really should.\n\nEdit: Despite what my mum went through, she is the most cheerful and sweetest woman I have ever known. It takes real strength to come out of such an abusive marriage and continue to live your life in such a positive way, and also raise her two children alone.",

At around 10pm on April 4, 1991, she dropped him off at his home after a barbecue. They planned to meet later after his mother got home from work because he was babysitting his brother at the time.\n\nAngela spent some time with her friend Kyla. At 11:15pm, she called Rob from a pay phone at the intersection of Jefferson and 2nd street, seven blocks from his home. While talking to him, she noticed a suspicious man circle the block several times in a green Ford pickup truck. It then pulled up beside her. The man got out and used the phone before getting back into his truck. He took out a flashlight and flashed it around his truck, looking for something. Angela described the man's appearance and truck to Rob. She then asked him if he needed to use the phone; he replied that he would try the other one again in a minute. She and Rob then returned to their conversation.\n\nJust a few moments later, Rob heard Angela scream. Chillingly, the man then said, \"I didn't need to use the phone anyway\". Rob immediately dropped his phone and ran outside to his car. He quickly drove toward the pay phone, hoping to help her. As the abductor's truck sped past him in the opposite direction, he heard her yell out to him. He threw his car in reverse, unknowingly damaging the transmission. He followed the truck for two miles before the transmission failed as he made a sharp right turn. Unfortunately, the truck drove away and was never seen again.\"\n\nShe's never been found.

About 10 years ago 4 friends and I were looking at it and seen a story about a one lane bridge that supposedly in the 60s a car with a prom couple when off the edge driven off by an oncoming car, and drown. The story said if you go there as the sun is going down right at dark, and walk out on the bridge and look in the water, you can see the headlights of the car and some say you can see the unfortunate girl submerged, still wearing her dress. \nAnyhow, it wasn't far from us, so being bored 20 something year olds, decided to check it out. The bridge was still there, one laned. On one side of the bridge there is a long curving driveway leading to a hidden mansion looking building in the forest and one the other side is farm land and forest like most rural WI. We park on the field side and me and one of my friends head out to the middle of the bridge. The bridge wasn't big, maybe three car lengths.  The other two friends are joking and laughing a few into the bridge from the road. We were there literally and I mean literally there for maybe 6 minutes at most. Waiting as the sun just left the sky, and looking into the water. The river wasn't big either, (more like a glorified stream),  when suddenly I felt uneasy and heard a loud snap coming from the driveway side of the bridge. My instincts kicked in high alert and I yelled run and booked it for the car. The instant I turned to run, I looked back at the driveway and headlights from a truck came roaring down the driveway, and then heard the sound of a loud motor come roaring from right up river, also the direction of the mansion. Thankfully none of my friends asked questions and also took off running to the car as soon as I did. The two closest friend jumped in car and started it up,  just as I got to off the bridge and maybe 12 feet from the car onto the road, I look again at the river and see a boat with 5 people in it, all dressed in black tactical clothing, and hats, with flashlights and guns, come flying up the 6 foot embankment right behind me. The two friends in the car start screaming at my friend and I running, to jump in the car window, and we both dived in. The people in the boat were already full sprinting behind us as we did. The friend driving had to hit it full reverse, as the truck had now made it's way to the bridge, and I kid you not, the people from the boat did not stop running at our car trying to get us. One person in particular was faster than anyone Ive ever seen. It was like that scene from terminator when the metal guy is chasing down on foot,  the terminator and the kid in the car. Our driver quickly sped faster, still in reverse and approaching a curve, and had gained enough ground to whip our car around, and speed away as fast as we could. So many things about the entire situation was so scary and strange. Like it couldn't have been cops or any law enforcement, as none of the people ever spoke, no commands to stop or anything let alone why would they be there?  And how the truck and the boat clearly were attempting to trap us on the bridge from both sides. And how quickly these people got ready and into position, again within 10 min of us being there. And how did they even know we were there? I've often wondered if the story in the book was a ploy to lure and trap unsuspecting victims.",

A few people from the bar go back with him to the house, & discover that his parents, & 4 siblings (ages between 9-18 years old) were all shot & killed in the house. Parents had 2 shots each, while the siblings only had 1 shot. According to[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_DeFeo_Jr.) (which I know isn’t the most accurate sometimes) 2 of the victims were supposedly awake based on physical evidence when they were shot, his mother & his 13 year old sister Allison. The gun was an air rifle (.35 caliber Martin 336C) & Butch faked innocence at first, claiming it was a mob hit. However, inconsistent stories to police led to him confessing to shooting. \n\nButch told various variants of the events of the shooting, one saying that his 18 year old sister Dawn shot the dad, mom then shot the  other siblings, Butch then shoots mom, & then Dawn & Butch struggle for the rifle, Dawn gets shot by accident. \n\nAnother variant of the story: Dawn (18) & unknown assailant kill the parents, Dawn then shoots the other siblings. Struggle for gun leads to Dawn being shot again\n\nButch, the convicted killer in the case, just recently passed in March at Albany Medical Center while he was serving time (sentenced 6 life sentences, convicted on 6 counts of 2nd degree murder). \n\nThe thing is, nobody knows which/if the stories Butch gave were true & many theories have come up over the years on the motive, or even if Butch had help.\n\nEdit: spelling (sorry this text is long)",

            "text": "This happened to me about 5 years ago. \n\nOn August 15th I was home from college for the summer and drove about 30 minutes north of my parent's home to do some shopping. It was an uncommonly cold and overcast summer day, even for New England. I had finished my shopping around 8pm and began to exit the town center when I was stopped at a traffic light. There were many pedestrians moving quickly to cross the street or enter a store as it had just begun to rain. There was one person, however, that was standing completely still on the sidewalk ahead of me. The man stood out because he looked so familiar; he was the spitting image of my boss back at college. It was clear it wasn't him, but the resemblance was uncanny. The light turned green, and I began the drive home. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n20 minutes into my drive along the rural forest lined roads the rain began to come down in sheets. The kind of rain that coats your windshield regardless of the speed setting. Between the dark and the rain I was very focused on the road ahead of me, and that's when I saw it. In the distance was a single beam of light. Circular, still, and 200 feet ahead. The closer I got to the light the more I was drawn to it. As I rounded a corner and came towards the light head on I noticed it was a floodlight on a flagpole in front of a home. Nothing special, most likely there to beware drivers of coming too close to their driveway in the dark. What I saw next made my blood go still and cold. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnder the the floodlight was a figure. A human. I instinctively slowed down. Why was there a person standing in the cold pouring rain on a nearly empty rural road? Maybe the person needed help. I slowed down to about 15-20 miles per hour and creeped towards the hooded figure standing below the light. When I finally approached I saw something I never could have prepared for. It was the same man I had seen 20 minutes earlier in the town center. He was soaking wet, smiling, and staring directly into my eyes as I passed. Bile rose in my throat as I tried to understand what I saw. I drove the fastest route home, didn't stop. That man was walking. There is no way he could have gotten to that point in the road faster than me. And why was he smiling, staring? Like he was waiting for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I could think too far all of the lights in and out of my vehicle went out. I was driving completely in the dark and had to come to a stop. I pulled over and ripped my phone from my purse. No service. I went to lock the doors and none of the controls were working. I went to start the car again and the key wouldn't turn over. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI woke up to banging on my bedroom door. \"Maggie! Maggie wake up! Why is your car parked like that? Hello? Maggie!\". My mother was shouting into my room questions I didn't understand. I looked out my window and my car was parked sideways in the center of the driveway, all doors open, with the hazard lights on. The memories of the night before came back to me and I wondered if it was all a dream. I grabbed my keys from my purse, pushed by my mom, and ran out to the car. The backseat was full of bags from my shopping trip. I wasn't dreaming. I turned off my hazards and shut all of the doors. I moved the car back to my spot, mind racing. As I began to head inside something told me to take a second look at my car. When I turned to face my trunk I saw two clearly defined handprints in a position to suggest that someone had been pushing my vehicle. I held my own hands up to the prints. They weren't mine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to forget everything I saw. Or imagined. I didn't want to think of it. A couple of days went by normally, and then I received a call. It was from a college friend I worked with, and her question stopped me in my tracks. She asked if I was going to Corey's funeral. Corey; the boss that struck an uncanny resemblance to the man I saw a few nights prior. I pressed my friend about what happened, and she shared he had died late on August 15th. His family found him and there was seemingly no cause of death. He was healthy and 31 years old. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no idea what happened to me the night of August 15th. I don't know how I got home. Who I saw. If what happened to me actually even happened. I do know that I'm more aware than I was before, and that somethings can never be explained.",

Farmers are allowed burning permits in our town to burn debris on their farms. Residential lots are not. Every year there are tons of burning complaints phoned in. Most are farmers who are allowed to burn being called in by cranky neighbors who aren’t allowed to.

One property kept getting called in. It was beside a new development who’s backyards overlooked the farmers fields, and neither of the 2 trucks or prevention made it a priority to attend. The guy was allowed to burn, they’d just drive out and ask if he had a permit which they mostly always do. Finally they have time to drive over and check it out hoping whoever kept calling would see and stop phoning. \n\nThey get to the property and head out across the field towards a quad and farmer. As they get closer they start yelling their hellos and greetings. Nothing. They think it’s odd but maybe he can’t hear them. As they get closer they notice he’s kneeling but still not turning to acknowledge them. Then it hits them, the guys been burned by his own fire.

He and Christopher (15) went out to try and commit burglary. They entered a warehouse and climbed onto the roof. When they did, a little girl opposite saw and the police were called.\n\nBentley had a knuckle duster and knife Chris had given him, and Chris had a gun.\n\nWhen the police came, he detained Derek (but did not arrest him.) Chris decided to shoot the police man and killed him. Despite a chance to run, Derek remained by the policeman's side for half an hour until more police arrived.\n\nDerek was wrongly accused of murder and was sentenced to death. He was hanged at the age of 19, at which point he couldn't even recognise letters of the alphabet or write them down.\n\nChristopher, despite being the one to commit murder, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and eventually released.\n\n45 years after the murder, it came to trial and it was ruled that the hanging was \"unsafe\" and he should not have been killed.\n\n\nThere's a film, \"Let Him Have It\".\n\nhttp://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/bentley.html",

My dad was still working in California so it was just my mom and I in the new house. The house was at the end of a dead end gravel road and there were no houses past us. It was heavily wooded and moving from a city to that was a little freaky. It was the first week of being in the house and there was a ton of work that it needed, so my mom and I went to bed pretty early those days. We had already gone to bed when sometime after 10pm there was a knock at the door. For reference: we have an Austrilian Sheppard that looks like a rottie and is aggressive with strangers, and to get to the front door you have to pull into a private drive and walk through a closed and gated deck. So clearly not the most inviting. The knock on the door makes our dog flip out and both my mom and I get up. We are already uneasy because we are in the middle of no where, its is pitch black out, and we are alone. My mom grabbed her hand gun and put it behind her back as she opened the door, while I tried to hold back the dog. The guy at the door claimed to be our neighbor and he wanted to welcome us (at 10pm??). My mom thanks him and tries to end the conversation but he stops her from closing the door. Our dog is flipping the hell out and I am barely able to hold her back. The guy at the door starts saying that he owns part of our land and that the well on the property is his and all this other crazy talk. My mom tells him he needs to leave and he refuses. Mom then pulls her gun out from behind her back and says \"you leave now or I am going to shoot you and then let my dog go so she can eat your ass\". The guy starts screaming and yelling, running off our deck and down our driveway to his truck. We didn't know until he yelled \"the bitch has a gun\" that he did not come alone. My mom locked the door and I called the police as they drove off. Amazingly, there was a deputy already in our area that stopped the guy before he even left the private road. He was given a trespass warning. One of the scarier moments of my life, but my mom was so calm and prepared to protect us. \n\nAnd yes, he did really turn out to be a \"neighbor\". He owns the lot next to our house but there is no house on it or utilities, he just camps there when he passes through the area every year or so.",

Well it had rained a good portion of the night, and it was winter, so everything was covered in about a inch of ice everything was slippery. We were walking down the side of the street because the sidewalks where impossible to walk down, they weren’t shoveled before the freezing rain so there were tracks in the snow add a inch of ice on top of that and you can’t walk on it with breaking your ankles. See so we’re on the side of the road going up a small hill same kinda thing from the other side so there was a little bit of the road that drops out of your line of sight for a couple of seconds. Well anyway I heard a horn and looked up and saw a car with a bunch of people we knew from school. They were all screaming and waving and for a couple seconds we thought they were screwing around driving crazy but then I realized what everyone in the car already knew they were going to hit us and not a thing they could do,!they were going way to fast and completely out of control. I grabbed me friend and jump as far as I could. I was holding on so tight to him when he got hit turned me back toward the car and I watched my friend I don’t know what to compare it to and the sound I’ll forget that crack I ran to wear he landed and he was still awake and aware of what was going kinda. Because I could see at least two compound fractures and I could see that he had hit his head hard. I was thinking and so was he that we made it through it and he wanted me to find his glasses and telling me that his head hurt turned around and stared looking around for his glasses and then I saw that the car was quite a ways down in the ditch   And about same time I saw the two power poles swinging by the wires and they where coming down soon one snapped and somehow. Didn’t land on me but it was in between me and my friend and I couldn’t get back to him then I got grabbed and I put in a ambulance. They gave me something that knocked me out and when I woke up my friend was gone. Miss him all the time. Wish I could have traded spots or the car would have hit both of us. This happened a long time ago and and I still feel the same way and that sound 30 something years later and I can hear and see the way he just bent and went flying like a rag doll you through by one of its arms",

It was an insanely crowded day, the kind where you have to make sure you're keeping up with all of your family.\n\nWe were in the section with the kiddie roller coasters and my aunt & dad were fighting over something ridiculous, so all of us were pretty distracted with getting them to just calm down.\n\nOut of nowhere, my mom shouts to me \"Follow me, now!\" She yanks me by the hand and pulls me along intently, without saying anything else.\n\nShe runs over directly to a man who must have been in his 60s. He's holding the hand of a crying boy, maybe five or so. My mother aggressively asks the man, \"What are you doing with him?\" and the man freezes. He says that they just lost the boy's mother. He tells us that he is the boy's grandpa and that they are fine. Immediately my mom kneels down and asks the boy \"Do you know this man?\"\n\nThe crying boy shakes his head no and says they are looking for his mommy. My mother asks the boy where he last saw her and the boy points to the man, \"He says that she's in the parking lot.\"\n\nI immediately go cold, because I realize what's happening here.\n\nI look at the man and he's staring at the little boy. And he swipes his tongue across his top lip in a fraction of a second.\n\nMy mom reaches for the boys hand, holds my own hand tighter, and says \"[My name] and I will help you find your mommy, okay? She isn't in the parking lot. We're going to go back to the last spot you saw your mommy, and we'll get a police officer to help us find her. Is that okay?\"\n\nThe boy looks to the older man and is visibly confused. \"But she's in the parking lot. We have to get her.\" My mother snaps at the old man to fucking let go of the boy. He's glaring at her at this point.\n\nThe man lets go and my mother picks the boy up. She promises him we will help him find his mommy, asks him where he last saw her, and the boy points to the entrance of one of the rides. We both look in that direction and by the time we turn back, the man is gone.\n\nWe end up finding a security officer who shouts into her walkie \"We found him!\" \n\nNext thing you know, a woman with two young twins in her hands is running to us in a panic. It was something straight out of a movie. She fell to the floor to hug her son and kept thanking my mother repeatedly in a crying fit. When she was able to talk, told us that she had let her son go on a ride and promised him that she would wait for him at the exit, but then one of her children started crying. She was a single mother.\n\nIt was only a few short moments of distraction that led to her turning back to find him completely missing.\n\nThe officer thanked my mother, who was also crying at this point, and we went back to my family who was worried about the two of us having been gone so long.\n\nMy mom explained everything. Amidst my dad and aunt fighting and all of the noise of the enormous crowd, she heard a distant \"I want my mommy!\" Somehow, out of the hundreds of people in that crowd, she was able to spot the kid and said that something instantly felt wrong. It was such a fast thing that she could have missed. She could have even over heard it and not been able to spot where it was coming from. \n\nWe all went home after that. We've never gone back to the fair in the some 12 years since.\n\nThe way he licked his lip, like the boy was some kind of dessert, still haunts me.\n\nThe fact that he got away still haunts my mother.",

The settlements with the state Corrections Department resolve cases brought in 1999 by Julienne Schultz, 39, of Burlington, N.D., and relatives of Alice Underdahl, 52, of Kent. Each is for $4.4 million. Underdahl, a United Airlines flight attendant, was raped and killed Sept. 23, 1997, while jogging along the Cedar Trail near her home. Her family would not comment on the settlement. Schultz, a mother of three and Burlington City Council member, was attacked five days later at a rest stop on U.S. 2 near White Earth, N.D., where her throat slashed and she was left for dead. She said she would use some of the money to try to reconstruct her voice, which remains a rough whisper. Puckett, 38, of Kent, was caught largely because Schultz managed to write notes describing her attacker while she was trying to stop her own bleeding. Cornered near Minot, N.D., 200 miles east of the rest area a few hours after the attack, Puckett shot himself to death. Puckett was convicted in 1980 of first-degree assault, robbery and rape of a friend's 86-year-old grandmother. Released from prison in May 1995, he stayed out of trouble until he was ticketed for speeding and driving with an expired driver's license in April 1997 in Kent. On Aug. 13, 1997, he was arrested in a county crackdown on sex offenders who failed to register their addresses with police but was released two days later on his own recognizance, despite a request by prosecutors to hold him on a $30,000 bond pending a hearing. Paul Whelan and Kevin Coluccio, lawyers for the Underdahl family and for Schultz, said they were prepared to present evidence that caseworkers ignored or failed to notice indicators that Puckett was entering a deviancy cycle.'' The lawsuits said it took two years for corrections officials to learn that he had failed to register as a sex offender after his release from prison, nor did they notice that his wife, considered a stabilizing influence, had left him in August 1997. In a written statement, state corrections officials said they agreed to the settlement as fiscally prudent'' largely because of court rulings and potential jury sympathy for the victims. The actions of community corrections officers were reasonable, given their workload and duties,'' but jurors might be influenced by the devastating impact these crimes have had,'' the statement said. Moreover, the officials wrote, State Supreme Court decisions have placed greater and greater liability on the state for the actions of third parties, in this case offender Puckett.'' Schultz dismissed that reasoning as a joke'' and said she wants an apology from state officials, not only for what Puckett did but also for the way a state assistant attorney general questioned her during a deposition. He tossed pictures of the crime scene where I was attacked. He wanted to know why the blood was where it was,'' she said. I didn't look at them. I could not tell you why the blood was where it was at all. I was trying to stay alive.''",

Anyways, my mom grew up in a rural area, and she has this true story she witnessed when she was little. Her sister had a friend who was one day walking with another girl, they saw an old lady walking by and she asked them what time it was. This one girl replied to her in a very rude manner, saying something along the lines of \"why do you need to know the time if you're old?\" and the lady approached her and hit her leg with her walking cane. Story goes that after a bit this girl who got hit by the witch started limping from that said leg. Time went by and her leg started getting worse, to the point she could not use it anymore. Countless doctors saw her and found nothing wrong with her leg, no cure, she even travelled to other countries to get her leg checked. Eventually she found no other solution and went to see a white witch (she didn't believe in curses and all of that, hence why this was her last resort). This white witch told her that the other witch had put a curse on her leg and since she had passed away there was no way to revert it, but after some time of her treatments with white magic the girl's leg healed and was back to normal.

It was the last day of school, and a 13 year old boy was sleeping soundly in the backseat of the class. It was a pretty big classroom and every student left after the bell rang. He kept sleeping and when he woke up, everyone had left except him. The Janitor didn't mind to check twice before locking all the classrooms and leaving. He tried to communicate people in other buildings through the window (it had railing) but his school was quite far away from a residential building. His parents asked the Janitor about him being left behind in the classrooms but he said that he checked them thoroughly while leaving. The kid kept trying to be heard and eventually lost his strength. There was nothing to eat so he scraped off the dry paint from the walls to eat and drank his own urine for salvation. After the summer vacation got over, (2 months later) the Janitor came to the school for cleaning the classrooms. After sensing a foul smell he went to open the door and found the kid's badly decomposed body in the backseat. This broke my heart. Since then, I make sure to be the last one leaving the classroom and checking for anyone between the seats. If the Janitor was a bit careful, poor boy would've never lost his life and died a horrible death.",

            "text": "This story isn’t necessarily what most would consider “scary”, but it’s something that’s been on my mind since it happened and I need to vent. \n\nIn my younger years I had a friend (16) who had very poor judgment. He was blinded by the love of a mutual female friend (17), whom he ended up having a child with. He would talk to me all the time about their future plans, current goals they had for the success of their unborn child, and how happy he was with her, and vice versa. \n\nWhen our mutual friend (F) was about 5 months pregnant, she went on a family vacation to Germany where she proceeded to cheat on my friend with one of her father’s friend’s sons. When she came back from her trip, she ended things with my buddy and to both of our surprise, had brought back the guy she cheated on him with. He was extremely saddened by this abrupt and life changing decision on her behalf. \n\nTime went on, as did our friendship and conversations about his plan for remaining in his child’s life. His child was born (him holding one of the ex-mutual friend’s legs and her new partner holding the other). When his child was about 3 months old, he received a phone call from his ex while we were at the skatepark together. From what he told me she was extremely blunt and emotionless when explaining to him that he needed to go to the children’s hospital because something had happened to their child. We hopped in my truck as fast and possible and sped to the hospital. \n\nWhen we got there, we located the room his child was being held in and frantically raced up the hospital stairs. We reached the floor and waiting around the hospital room were three detectives (two were investigators and another was a CPS representative). My friend was confused as they asked him if he had a moment to talk - and in that time, I was no longer allowed to be near him or the hospital room so I waited in the lobby. \n\nMy friend’s child had been physically abused to the point where she had a total of twelve fractures, multiple bruises, and slight blunt force trauma to the back of her head. The investigators had questioned the mother as well, but seemed to have more of an interest in my friend. He explained to me that they would try and trick him with confusing questions and disinformation on his child’s situation. \n\nAfter his interview with the investigators and CPS rep. he was able to visit his child in the hospital room which was filled with his ex’s family members who instantly attacked him with verbal accusations and physical confrontation. As expected, emotions were high and everyone was puzzled as to how this could have happened. My friend told me that once everyone had time to calm down, there was a long silence in the room until his ex’s mother admitted to “playing with the child a bit too rough a few times”. It’s important to understand that the ex’s mother was highly dependent on pain medications for her severe medical conditions. This confession was not only heard by my friend and his ex’s family, but by the nurse, doctor, and CPS rep. who was present at the time of examination.\n\nAfter the ordeal at the hospital, things began to change rapidly for my friend and his situation. CPS opened up a case against my friend and his ex which lasted for three years. In this time their child was a ward of the state. When no guilt on behalf of my friend or his ex was found (not a single soul was found guilty of abusing his child), the child was returned back to his ex who proceeded to battle him in court for another three years to sever his rights on grounds of mental instability (speculation), substance abuse (marijuana), and failure to protect his child. He was painted as a drug addicted, narcissistic, child abuser who exhibited sociopathic behavior. He was tormented by the system, and in turn, as his primary source of support, so was I.\n\nThis experience has affected him in the worst way possible. He is too paranoid to talk to anyone in the professional field about his trauma from the experience because he is terrified that it will be documented and further support his ex’s claims of mental instability which would cause him to lose the visitation he has been able to fight for. I understand where he’s coming from but I also believe that he has truly began to disconnect from his reality for the sake of survival. I try and check up on him but he is weary of phone calls and communication in general. To cope, he tells me he makes music but I’ve never heard any of it. \n\nIf you see this, I love you bro.

They offered to buy Sharon candy and clothing if she would get in the car with them. When she refused, they dragged her into the vehicle and fled, turning west onto Fifth Street and disappearing.\n\nThe abduction was reported immediately and within about an hour police set up roadblocks to try and catch the green car at the Texas/New Mexico state border, but their efforts were fruitless. Sharon has never been heard from again.\n\nThe male abductor is described as a fair and thin Caucasian man with a long nose and straight sandy-colored hair. The female is described as short and overweight with dirty blonde hair and eyeglasses; she was in her thirties. Witnesses reported that a woman matching the description of Sharon's female abductor had been seen in the neighborhood, asking questions about Sharon, her mother and their home.\n\nAuthorities believe the couple had been stalking Sharon for at least a week prior to her abduction. They had been seen after church the Sunday prior to her disappearance, accompanied by two young children, a boy with freckles and a girl. The woman knocked on a neighbor's door to ask about Sharon's mother, Lupe Gallegos. She inquired where Lupe lived and what her financial situation was, and whether she had a little girl and whether she had a lot of children. The woman said she wanted to offer Lupe a job.\n\nIt's possible that the strange couple had tried to abduct Sharon before her disappearance on July 21. Sharon's mother stated Sharon suddenly stopped wanting to go to the grocery store around the corner; previously, she had enjoyed doing this. She also got upset when she saw a green car, and asked to be picked up and carried past it.\n\nAt the time of her disappearance, Sharon lived with her mother, her grandmother, her aunt and uncle, and six siblings and cousins. Her father, a soldier, had left the family when she was a baby and she had no contact with him. The family was not rich; Lupe supported them by working as a motel maid. They had no telephone at the home and no one ever contacted them with a ransom demand.\n\nSharon's abductors have never been identified and her case remains unsolved.\n\nIdk it just creeps me out to think that they were stalking her for sometime and that she knew they were.

Everything is going well, we were setting up the setting for a birthday party with birthday lights and the sort. A bit of time passes and me and my friend go out bike riding, so we enter an area of my city Divo Naselje.it is basically an area of my city where majority Albanians live, it has highest crime rate in my city.\n\n So we park next to a market we went to buy some water and then I just hear gunshots outside with police sirens and everything my ears ring as the cashier pushes the alarm button, me and my friend we were scared and sobbing waiting in the store.\n\nThe workers there closed down the store pulling down the metal bars and all.we hid in the storage room in the market. We hear ambulances in the distance, we saw some people getting transported in the ambulances we got calmed by the cashier to stop sobbing. We calm down I peek through the storage room door as I hear a man screaming \"I got shot god have mercy!\" I close the door lightly my mom called me too see if I was ok I explained the situation she obviously panicked told me to stay calm and wait for the police to come and escort us.\n\nA few hours pass, it felt like an eternity we waited hearing gunshots for multiple hours. Just trying to stay calm. It felt like I was losing my sanity like it was never ending. I was terrified at one point I called my mom and my brother and told them if I don't come back that I love them. \n\nAfter about 15 hours of waiting we hear the gunshots stop we wait another hour ( after the gunshots ended ) and we exit the building, pretty soon a SWAT truck picked us up escorted us home calmed us down. I still remember it as a childhood trauma.\n\nTLDR: me and my friend go for a bike ride and survived a terrorist attack in a market storage room.\n\nIf your interested what this is terrorist attack was called its Kumanovo 2015 Divo Naselje terrorist attack it has a wiki page that I'm too lazy to link.",

Luckily me and my sister didn't have to visit him since he never signed any adoptions papers for us, and we didn't want to visit him anyways. \n\nThe summer between my 6th and 7th grade started off well, but it very quickly went downhill. My mom found out he had a girlfriend who did drugs and my mom refused to even give us the option to visit him, which was understandable.\n\nOne night me and my sister were hanging out at home when our ex-step-father called her. He said \"I really need to see you girls, I'm coming over in 10 minutes and I don't care if your mom won't let me in, I'll force my way to see you if I have to. I'll even take you if that means I can see you.\" We were terrified and my sister gave her phone to our mom and she was furious. She yelled at him and he didn't come, luckily. \n\nThroughout the Summer he kept showing up at our house when we weren't home and trying to contact us, my mom had enough and wrote a cease and desist (?) letter saying if he didn't stop she'd take him to court for harassment. That didn't stop him for long, though. I was terrified every night that I'd be kidnapped. I was even terrified to go out in public because he got an apartment near my house. I was 12 years old and fearing for my well-being, along with severe depression and anxiety. \n\nIt's been several years and I haven't heard from him. He's finally left our family alone. He still lives in the same city as me, but now I'm not afraid of him. My feelings for him are no longer fear and paranoia, they're now anger and hatred. He can't hurt me anymore and I know how to break him down, by showing I'm not afraid.

Katie yelled for her 6-year-old son, who was in the room at the time, to run and get help. The young boy ran over a mile to his uncle's home, but by the time the man arrived at the scene of the crime, Katie was long dead. Seeing his brother standing beside her gruesome body, covered in blood, the man feared for his own life and fled to the house of a nearby English family where he called 911.\nWhen assistant fire chief and EMTs Andy McLaughlin arrived on the scene, the scene was horrific. Gingerich had beaten Katie to death, taken the time to put on heavy, high top boots, and stomped on Katie's skull until she was left unrecognizable. Not only that, Gingerich had removed all her internal organs and piled them beside her body.[3] In recordings of Gingerich's police interrogation, he can be heard saying that \"For some reason, I think we could still save her\".",

I also said \"hello\" and I noticed that I did it in the same way - in my head without sound. then I proceed with \"who's there?\". the voice in my head replies \"I'm Anya.  I'm an 18 years old girl. I'm a suicider\". then for couple of seconds I see an old black and white and grainy photograph right before my eyes where there are three hardly recognizable people seem to be in a summer camp. one of the figures resembles a slim dark haired girl. at that point I'm no longer sure if I'm still sleeping and having a dream, but I ask her \"why did you come here?\". she replies \"to be friends\". idk why but I tried to joke, which turned out to be stupid and awkward. I said \"well, we couldn't have sex anyway\" because it became obvious to me that she was dead. immediately after I say this I see complete darkness and a giant skull made of smoke flying at me. I scream in fear but I can't make a sound. and then in a matter of a couple of seconds I was sure I figured out one thing - I was depressed at the time and such entities (things, whatever it was) are attracted to negative energy. so I said with confidence \"Anya, we can't be friends, you should go now. Go away\". everything stopped and I woke up finally in cold sweat, I saw my room it was absolutely the same. to this day I don't know what the hell was that. it could have been just a nightmare, but I was so sure I already woke up and the talking was so real it scared the shit out of me",

So, I see a bright white light last for a few seconds inside the bathroom, I look inside and I don’t see anything. I was creeped out cause there were no windows, no electronics or anything alike. The second one was when I was going to get a glass of water, I see light coming from the living room from my end of the hallway which lasts for a few seconds. Apparently my younger self had balls of steel because I decided to investigate. There was no one, And the closest window was in the opposite direction of the light. There was a TV in the living room but I don’t think it would just turn on randomly.\n\nI’ve been thinking about these two experiences for years and the only rational explanation I could come up with was that I was imagining it, can someone provide a reasonable explanation for these two events?",

When I got back out into the living room, I was about to go back to sleep when I looked out the window and saw a guy standing in the gravel driveway. I went over to the window and looked out, trying not to let the guy see me. I didn't recognize him as an uncle or even as my dad. \n\nFreaked out, I ran over and woke up my brother. He was confused because as a little kid I never got freaked out easily. So he looked out the window and freaked out too. He told me to check the front door and see if it was locked while he used the house phone to call the police. \n\nThen after we called the police, we woke our grandparents up who also got freaked out. About 10 minutes later, the police got there and arrested the guy. \n\nApparently he was wanted by the local police for kidnapping and murdering two children 7 and 5 years old.",

I can only see the top of her head, I knew it was her because she's wearing a long white camisole that we usually wear inside our duty uniform.\n\nFew more seconds passed, she really didnt move from where she was so i gave up and was about to return to the spare room but the sound of the door opening across the hall stopped me. My friend peeked out of the door looking around the hall and found me. She asked why the heck am i just calling out to her when I could've just come straight to her room.\n\nI panicked and looked down the stairs, and there was noone there. i was stunned in silence until my friend went to me and said, \"oh, did you see the white lady?\" i looked at her, eyes wide. i was unable to speak and she was freaking laughing at me. \"don't worry, she's harmless.\" then proceeds to go to the spare room.

            "text": "So, last Sunday my parents made me go to church ,which made me really mad because my parents don't let me play Among Us in church.\n\nWe took our seats and the priest was up front talking about \"salvation\" and \"holiness\" or whatever. Same thing as last week.\n\nBut then, he said something that really caught me off guard. He spoke of a man who goes by the name of \"Jesus.\"\n\n\"Jesus.\"\n\n\"JeSUS.\"\n\nNo way. I could not believe what I was hearing.\n\nEndorphins were rushing to my brain and my body began to shiver as I let out a quiet moan.\n\nIf you didn't catch on by now, the word \"Jesus\" has \"SUS\" in it, which is a reference to the popular video game \"Among Us.\"\n\n\"WHEN THE IMPOSTER IS SUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nI screamed louder than I ever have in my life. My words echoed throughout the room for five seconds before fading into complete silence.\n\nEveryone was staring at me as I had a huge grin on my face, perfectly replicating the face from the \"when the imposter is sus\" meme (Google it if you don't know what it is.)\n\nThey all had this look on their faces as if I had just slaughtered 7,924 Afghanian children.\n\n\"Why do you all have that look on your faces? Did someone do a Fortnite dance?\"\n\nAnd there was still complete silence. I actually had to make sure I wasn't wearing my noise cancelling headphones that I always wear while playing Among Us. I could not believe that not one person in the room was dying of laughter!!\n\n\"Young man, please be quiet\" said the priest.\n\nHe was literally the one who made the Among Us reference in the first place. What's his problem?\n\n\"THAT'S NOT VERY WHOLESOME!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThis guy was definitely the imposter. There's no way he couldn't be.\n\nI Naruto ran faster than anyone has ever Naruto ran before. Even Naruto himself would be proud of me.\n\nAs I was making my way up to the imposter, the security guard was chasing after me!\n\nI had to think fast.\n\nAfter being chased around the room for two minutes, I hastily undid my pants and peed in the security guard's eyes. As he was being blinded by my pee, he was stumbling around and bumped into the wall very hard.\n\nA crucifix fell off the wall and impaled his stupid, ugly fat head. He fell and a pool of blood soon formed around him.\n\nEveryone in the church was screaming and running out the door. I slammed my hand down on the crucifix, replicating the button you press in Among Us, which drove the crucifix further into his skull.\n\n\"EMERGENCY MEETING!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nNo one laughed. They were too busy screaming to notice. Whatever.\n\nI stripped completely naked and went up to the priest. I replicated the Big Chungus pose with 100% accuracy.\n\n\"You probably don't even use Reddit. That's not very keanu chungus wholesome 100 of you. Go subscribe to r/atheism.\"\n\nThe priest had a look of shock on his face when I said that. The kind of face one would make if they caught their beloved child playing Fortnite.\n\nHe held a cross in front of himself and started talking about \"possession\" and \"demons.\" He obviously doesn't know how to play Among Us so naturally, I felt bad for him.\n\nBut he was still the imposter.\n\nI grabbed him and threw him across the church, sending him crashing through the window and slammed against the street outside. A car ran over his head, causing his brain and skull fragments to splatter everywhere.\n\nThen, I heard sirens and a helicopter flying around above the church. I went upstairs to the roof to check out what was going on.\n\n\"This is the police! Get down from the roof now or we will shoot!\"\n\nThis guy is so sus, let me tell ya.\n\nObviously, I was not going to listen to an imposter so I was Naruto running around the roof. Bullets from the helicopter were raining down from above but none of them hit me since I was Naruto running so fast.\n\n\"Dammit, I can't hit him!\"\n\nI knew I had him beat then.\n\nSo, I pulled out my gun (I always keep a glock in my foreskin so I can pull the Among Us death animation when I lose my virginity because I know it makes girls horny.)\n\nI shot at the helicopter and it started spinning out of control and crashed into the front of the church, causing a huge explosion.\n\nThe roof started sliding off from the building, which landed on the cop cars and killed 8 cops. This also flung me into the street and I broke my foot, which was very sus.\n\nI limped all the way to the woods where I am now hiding and writing this. I will update as soon as I can but I need to get out of here soon because I can hear people looking for me.",

I was like 11 or 12 when this happened and it still freaks me out till this day. My cousin lived in the in the deeper part of the country and we would always visit him and my aunt, we practically lived in the woods and played on the dirt road all the time. My older cousin and his family lived down the road and would always have sketchy people that would go down there.  Me, my cousin who was probably like 14 but super tall and my younger sister who was maybe 8 were down the road from where my cousin lived and there was a ditch that had a creek going through it that went under the road, it was super grassy and definitely not safe to go in so my cousin went first to check it out. I have always been a paranoid person even as a child. So I kept watch out on the first road making sure no one was coming. My cousin had found some stuff down there and was going through it and I see a truck fly by us and then stopped and started reversing very quickly. I yelled for my cousin \"hey this truck is reversing, come up here right now\"!! there were two guy in the truck and he asked \"what are yall doing down here by yourselves\" (1st red flag) I replied \"oh just exploring with my cousin\" he then proceeded to say \"oh well I only seen her (he pointed to my little sister) and I thought she might be in some trouble and down here by herself, I don't see your cousin\".. he continues to ask me questions about who my parents are and how its not safe to be down there by ourselves and while he is asking me questions, I'm saying my cousins name over and over because at this point the guy in the passenger seat gets out of the truck and starts to grab something out of the back of the truck and walk around the truck and at this point I'm looking around for the quickest way to get out of the situation or to use something to defend ourselves. My cousin finally is able to get up from the creek area and he stood up and was like what's going on here and when he got up and they realized there was a boy with us and he was tall and and not small the passenger proceeds to put whatever he had in his hand back in the truck and gets back in the truck. The driver begins to ask my cousin all the questions he asked me and was like alright well I'll let yall go.. I always wondered if my cousin had stayed down there in the creek or even what would have happened if my cousin wasn't with us at all. \n\nCouple of months later, I came home from school (my sisters were in the afternoon program) So I rode the bus to my house and was there alone until my mom and dad got off work. like I said I'm paranoid so I sit on the couch that is right in front of our living room window and keep the phone right by me at all times and watch the tv on mute so that I can hear if someone pulls up. I hear someone pull up in the driveway and I peek out the window AND IT'S THE SAME GUYS FROM BEFORE!!! I Immediately go to the backroom and lock the bedroom door and call my cousin who lives not to far from me and she said she was coming. While I'm waiting, they walk around my house and around my dad's shed and walk up onto the porch but they don't knock.. they just sit there.. I stay as quiet as possible and just pray they leave. they get off the porch and make one more walk around and get in their truck and leave.. my cousin comes and checks everything out and I leave with her.. My dad knew mostly everyone in town and when I described them to my dad he had no clue who I was talking about... I've never seen them after that and they never came back... \n\nThis is a lot. I have more stories that are so sketchy that has happened to me and my family from the small town we live in. everyone who is from the town knows to not cause trouble with my dad because of who he is and his family.. So I know for a fact that they weren't from our town.",

I was in the woods behind my house one day I saw a brown face with brown fur all over it besides the face.It was peeking from around a tree and was about as tall as one of the branch’s. If I had to guess probably 8 feet tall. And when I saw it I was completely terrified I ran back to my house hysterically crying. I don’t remember what happen when I told my parents but I remember for a long time after i would only play in the front yard.",
