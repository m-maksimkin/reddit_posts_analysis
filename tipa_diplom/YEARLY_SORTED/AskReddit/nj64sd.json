He used his fame, power, money to silence all of his victims, with the help of his own family. He drove Evan Chandler to suicide by having the media depict him as a psychopathic and abusive father (obviously this wasn't true), as pure revenge against his son Jordan for suing him. On a few occasions, he launched smear campaigns against whoever tried to expose him. Heck, he even had the balls to play the victim on TV when he got into legal trouble for that, saying the \"lies and ignorance\" were \"ruining him\", when every time he was sued, he ended up continuing to make music and tour around the world like nothing happened. And no, having a bad childhood is no excuse for repeating the same errors, or in this case, doing WORSE. Even after his death, you can't even say anything about that without having his family threatening to sue you for \"libelling a dead person\". Look what's happening with everyone involved with the documentary *Leaving Neverland*.\n\nSo yeah, the King of Pop also deserved to get called \"Wacko Jacko\".\n\nEDIT : Messed up the surnames of Jordan and Evan Chandler, sorry.",

It wasn't even legal to free them at the time. One may argue that his ownership of slaves wasn't his choice (he inherited 10 once his father died when he was only 11), but he has since purchased many more on his own will (owning 153 people once he died). He criticized harsh plantation owners, but then ordered one of his slaves to be whipped for walking on the lawn. \n\nShall we talk about the Native Americans? George Washington was kind to them and let them live (how nice of him) if they let him take their land. If they wouldn't let him take their land, he called them \"savages who needed to be extirpated\" - an old-fashioned word for genocide.",

After the Revolution was won, he spent his whole political life working on restricting the rights of the American citizenry, having America take loaned to the Bank Of England, and thus bringing us back in the European aristocracies power structure, advocated for the destruction of Shays Rebellion, which was basically a failed second Revolution based on the fact that the American government was doing all the same shit England was, advocated for further military power over the citizenry, thus subverting the purpose of the Second Ammendment, and strongly adovcated to preserve slavery.\n\nOh and just cause Miranda played him doesn’t mean he was a minority.

Many die young, many have no time/energy for family, many are mentally ill and addicted. It seems actually that ALL great musicians have been drug addicts early on, and only after surviving that initial period do they clean up. SO we're also becoming a society with zero forgiveness in it. Great, good to see such fantastic progress from the peanut squad telling us all how to live.\n\nBut yeah, let's judge the talented who bring us great work because....they are so much worse than average losers, right?\n\nSorry, they aren't.\n\nI've heard as many horrific stories of lousy parenting/partnering from average people as famous ones. Only difference is average people get away with it easier, because very often there is no one to hold them accountable other than the aggrieved party, who often isn't brave enough to confront them.\n\nBut average people with no talent need to tear down great talent that makes billions of consumers happier and more inspired through the brilliance of their work, which took massive sacrifice to get made. Got it.\n\nNot excusing Bing Crosby, Bill Cosby or Weinstein, but spending all this time digging into past events that no one was present for is a bit much.\n\nAlso, John Lennon's been dragged a billion times for his treatment of Julian, and it's been gone over by everyone. He was a better father in his mid to late 30s to Sean and Julian has acknowledged that.\n\nLennon was killed because his messages were so powerful, they were actually a threat to the American militarist/racist nightmare about to reboot with Ronald Reagan, and Lennon was going to tour with the Dems. I'd take John Lennon over Ronald Reagan, Dick Cheney, Richard Nixon, The Bushes, or Clintons because they may have been nice to their families, but they were real good at slaughtering millions overseas and perping lovely acts like starting the crack and heroin epidemics at home, (not to mention killing off labor unions and job exporting).\n\nLay off celebs. They are the minor leagues compared to politicians when it comes to being 'bad people'. Fact is, the elites like to submarine celebs because they are often the strongest leaders that rise up from the working class.",

Normally, reddit would put a ton of hate on that but he gets the good looking exception, or the talented dancer and rapper exception.  I don’t think it was the system out to get him, like he would say.  I also have seen interviews with the victim and she is credible.  He had access to the best lawyers, and took it to trial.  He ended up with a suspended sentence after dioing nine months, but he deserved more time than that.  He made this girl blow his whole entourage.  It was disgusting, and it was just to show off, really.  if he was alive today I wouldn’t want to be around him, or have my kids around him.  He was also a chameleon…when he was in High School, he hung around with Jada Pinkett, wrote poems, listened to U2, and acted in plays.  When he jumped on the 90s gangsta rap bandwagon, he wanted to prove he was hard so bad that he was just a loose cannon.  I have watched all his interviews and it pains me to say this because he was intelligent, likable and charismatic and I think had a good side…I also have listened to his rap and its good, but sorry, he was a also an opportunistic manipulative phony and more importantly a sex offender who showed violence on many occasions and therefore a terrible person.",

Great musician and advocated for peace, but he wasn't at all peaceful to those closest to him. He was abusive to his first wife Cynthia. There marriage where more forced I believe because they where young and then got pregnant, which was when Julian came into the picture. John Lennon had many arguments with Cynthia and was also physically abusive with her. He didn't really show any love and attention to Julian. Eventually when Julian was 5 Cynthia and John divorced. But then he married Yoko Ono and he was obsessed with her. Constantly dragging her to recording sessions, when the rule had been established by the members to not bring in their partners in the studio. There was one point where Yoko got herself in a car crash and John insisted bringing her in the studio in her bed! When he and Yoko had their son, Sean, John took a hiatus from music for paternity leave to look after Sean. Pay in mind that he never ever did such a thing for Julian, which is horrible. Paul McCartney was more of a father to Julian than John was. The song 'Hey Jude' was written by Paul, originally titled 'Hey Jules', as a way to comfort Julian during his parents divorce.\n\nAnother I forgotten about but reminded from this thread is Mother Theresa. She's sainted and hailed for her humanitarian service in India, but she had classic mid-evil religious beliefs and was a hypocrite. She believed that people should just suffer and not get healed.

Steve Jobs always felt rejected and probably got a kick out of being praised so much, but he did try to make amends with his daughter and wife and such. I'm a huge, and I mean *huge* Beatlemaniac, so this next part may be biased, but John Lennon during the seventies wasn't abusive at all. He was great with Yoko and Sean, and he got really close to Cynthia and Julian and even with Paul McCartney during the lost weekend. He felt immense remorse about how he had treated Cynthia and Sean, and he stayed at home from '75 till 1980 to be a house husband. Plus, I think he may be correct in saying Imagine is just a song because John rarely ever sang about something. He rarely ever sang from the heart, and since music is subjective, personally I don't take Imagine's lyrics literally, for example, Imagine no possessions as in you could be a bit generous or imagine no countries meaning imagine no discrimination, etc. John was a jerk and a bit of a character, and he had his problems with substances (his coroner said his body was that of a 60 year old when he was shot), and his actions toward Julian and his Cynthia were terrible, but honestly, I think you'd feel a little empathetic if you actually followed on his life, or Jobs'.  Julian Lennon has been a bit more forgiving of his father as of late, and he and Sean are good buddies, and Julian apparently got to spend a lot of time with John during his teenage years. By 1980, John was an entirely different person than what he used to be during the Beatlemania days. I'm sure there are other names here that deserve a little empathy or a bit more information to judge, so after the Reddit hivemind is done downvoting me, be sure to leave a few names in the thread, I'd love to read up on some dead people myself!",

There's of course the set of The Shining with Shelley Duvall, but then there's also numerous times he didn't treat his actors (albeit not as bad as Shelley) pretty badly. For example, I heard on the set of Dr. Strangelove when George C. Scott's character fell, it was an accident. Kubrick kept it in the editing because he thought that was intentional, but Scott got pissed because Kubrick didn't confront him about. Damn. \n\nIt seems like the only positive thing about filming where he didn't treat his actors so badly was 2001, which is one of my favorite movies so apologies if I'm biased.",

Not sure if anyone brought this one up yet but while she was dedicated to helping the poor in her opinion it wasn't necessarily in a manner most would consider ethical.

Expired medications and unsanitary conditions were common including such practices as rewashing needles. She valued suffering as a holy virtue that brought the poor closer to god.

I think not. Also this man was so obsessed with the title of pm that he placed his daughter in the seat as soon as his time was done.\n\nNot saying he was a completely bad guy, he did a lot of good as well, but I feel like there are some uncovered stuff abt him that was covered up well by his political party. \n\nAgain, no proof so don't take wht I said as the truth.",

To remedy this, the producers and director put that little girl on methamphetamin and made her smoke cigarettes and drink coffee. All of that made it so she couldn’t sleep so she was out on some other addictive drug for sleep. Also, she was sexually assaulted and harassed frequently during her time playing Dorothy. The actors who played the munchkins reached up her skirt and did things to her. I’m sure many other terrible things happened to that poor girl. \nAll of this came as a surprise to me having seen the movie numerous times and thinking about what a magical  little world Dorothy was in.

Not a big deal perhaps, the most progressive people of that time would’ve used language that’s today considered slurs. But it is apparent from his early writings that Gandhi didn’t consider all people equal. He considered black people to be dirty and unruly. And while he championed independence for India he argued that the similarly foreign-ruled black majority of South Africa was to primitive to govern themselves and needed to be ruled by white people (I suppose (?) being ruled by Indians would’ve been all right as well, but that was never really an option).",

His actions during the Tonypandy riots haunted him to the day he died, because he thought it was a great and wondrous idea to combat striking miners with police who are ill-equipped and ill-prepared.\n\nAs for his racist comments, he was the sort of individual who basically had a list of his favourite races and his justifications for why he liked or disliked them. He also espoused imperialism to an absurd degree, had a strong disdain for Indian and Chinese people, and was disturbingly eager to use chemical weapons against Iraqi rebels (whom he labelled as \"uncivilised tribes\", which - although not uncommon for the time - is still very disparaging) in the early 1920s.\n\nIt's only in the last few years that people - generally speaking - in the UK are starting to have a discussion about the sort of individual Churchill was: was he one of the greatest Britons to have ever lived, or was he one of the most rotten?

Rickman later used his past affiliation with the movement as a means to further fuel his ruse of terrorist activities. Besides his reputation, he used his terrorist background to command his underlings to anticipate and repel the forthcoming counterattacks. Only when the Volksfrei leaders issued a statement to the U.S. government denying any complicity in the Nakatomi Plaza attack since Alan Rickman had been kicked out of the organization years ago did it start to dawn another motive may be at stake. Rickman was likely a sell-out to his own views, trading some of his extremist beliefs in order to retire in style from the ill-gotten gains of bearer bonds.\n\nNow only concerned with personal gain, he concocted an elaborate robbery scheme using a terrorist pretense as a cover to manipulate the authorities with his plan. He led his gang of 13 thieves to Los Angeles, California on Christmas Eve where a party of employees was being held to take control of the Nakatomi Plaza.\n\nMaking their presence known through gunfire, the team gathered everyone up and took them as hostages, and Alan Rickman began his trickery, posing as a radical freedom-fighter by making a short speech about \"the Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of greed and deceit\", which added to the belief the attack was terrorist-related. Rickman then used his knowledge of the president of Nakatomi trading, Joseph Takagi, in order to draw him out. Once he had Takagi, he led the businessman to a board room where he then made his true intentions known.\n\nStill believing him to be a terrorist, Takagi continued to make assumptions about the purpose of the takeover to which Rickman impatiently told him to sit down. He then continued to question Takagi. After repeatedly denying that he knew the code, Takagi bravely asserted that they were just going to have to kill him. Unfortunately, Rickman agreed, and killed Takagi by a single shot to the head.\n\nOne of the coworkers, Harry Ellis, tried to negotiate with Alan Rickman. Police helplessly tell Ellis that Rickman would kill him, to which Rickman proves when Ellis fails. Alan Rickman then talks to the police over the radio, demanding the release of several comrades in arms imprisoned around world; seven members of the New Provo front, five leaders of the Liberte de Quebec, and nine members of the Asian Dawn movement. When they found Gruber working at the explosives planted on the roof, Gruber passed himself off as an escaped hostage.\n\nRickman detonated the C4 and the roof exploded.  \n\nI stopped watching the documentary at this point. It was quite shocking how a man like Alan Rickman could execute people and nearly demolish a building in Los Angeles, and then become a beloved master of mixing potions and Emma Thompson's husband.",

If convicted, according to the 13th Amendment of the United States Constitution, you are then enslaved—you are officially a slave of the United States.\n\nThe United States has the highest incarceration rate on Earth, and what's unfortunate is America's criminal justice system has a tendency to incarcerate and/or convict innocent people. And if ~~slaves~~ inmates are a city's primary, or only, source of income then they're more likely to have a more corrupt criminal justice system >!\\*cough\\* Kenosha \\*cough\\*!< and, in turn, a higher innocent conviction rate. They also seem more inclined to do whatever means necessary to convict someone without any actual evidence. Of course, the official term is a Kangaroo Court. I don't think it's just a coincidence, but that's my opinion.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation itself isn't a bad thing as it freed the slaves, but the written contents make the reason seem questionable. Roughly 75% of the total document is about the rebellion and the armed forces being required to allow the former slaves to enlist, including mention that the freed slaves of suitable condition are to be drafted. It is written that it is a military necessity. Again, I'm not saying the emancipation is wrong; only that the contents make the reason behind it questionable regarding it being done genuinely out of ethics, or simply because he wanted more bodies fighting for the Union. Post-war, Lincoln was also big on the idea of removing anyone of color, affected by the emancipation, to be removed from the US. Mostly to Liberia, but anywhere would've been fine to him when Liberia was becoming too densely populated.\n\nLastly, Abraham Lincoln was ***HIGHLY*** discriminatory to the indigenous population. Often taking land and resources by force, had blatantly discriminating policies, committed several accounts of genocide on indigenous peoples. The effects of what Lincoln did still affected many indigenous peoples long after his assassination—even to this day.\n\nLincoln is known as The Great Emancipator, but he's got some quite rather negative titles on himself as well.",

The missions have been described as \"homes for the dying\" by doctors visiting several of these establishments in Calcutta. Two-thirds of the people coming to these missions hoped to a find a doctor to treat them, while the other third lay dying without receiving appropriate care. The doctors observed a significant lack of hygiene, even unfit conditions, as well as a shortage of actual care, inadequate food, and no painkillers. The problem is not a lack of money--the Foundation created by Mother Teresa has raised hundreds of millions of dollars--but rather a particular conception of suffering and death: \"There is something beautiful in seeing the poor accept their lot, to suffer it like Christ's Passion. The world gains much from their suffering,\" was her reply to criticism, cites the journalist Christopher Hitchens.

Some people say that this scripture is just about spiritual unions but he didn't do this \"sealing\" ceremony with his first wife until long after he had married lots of other women.

He also pulled this “I’m going to drop out” move when he wanted to attend the most expensive liberal arts school, Reed College yet living down the street from Stanford — only to drop out.

Vanity was a great example of this; once she and Prince started dating she basically became his puppet, fronting Vanity 6 and existing mainly as a conduit for Prince to write pop music from a female perspective. She was originally going to star opposite him in Purple Rain, but just before the film went into production she started pushing back on his total control of her life, at which point he dumped her, fired her from Vanity 6, and took up with Apollonia who got her spot in the movie, the band (now rebranded as Apollonia 6), and the end of Prince’s puppet strings.",

She exemplified everything wrong with white savior \"missionary\" work, and people describe her as a troubled individual who enjoyed living in a \"museum of poverty.\"\n\n\nIt's very troubling that her very name has become associated with martyrdom when Indians widely believe she exploited their poverty for her own fame, wealth, and ideological zealotry, while harming people in their country and spreading dangerous beliefs about health.",

This is a man who once asked the mother of a 14-year-old girl he liked if she could move to Graceland with him. As he reasoned, \"I just want to raise her. ... I want her there as my wife.\" He had an obsession with law enforcement and his ego was so inflated he'd imitate police officers. Putting a siren on his car and actually pulling people over. \"You're speeding, son... slow down a little\" he'd say, then hand over a 'ticket' which was really just an autograph. He flew to Washington, D.C. to get a meeting with then President Richard Nixon. He wrote a 6 page letter on the way in effort to convince President Nixon to allow him to be an officer of The Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the precursor to the Drug Enforcement Administration. He thought this badge would allow him to travel globally with any drugs he desired. \n\nRead More: https://www.grunge.com/11639/dark-truth-behind-elvis/?utm_campaign=clip",

I would always ask him by name. I used to love classics like \"Chicken Heart\" (I still think about it when I see footie pajamas), the ones about go karts, and the tonsil surgery. When I got a little older we started watching Cosby show reruns as a family. I loved it all. Then when all that stuff came out about him, I didn't want to believe it, but the evidence was too staggering. He seemed like such a nice, genuine guy on the car stereo or on TV. Now I think back with a weird sense of skewed nostalgia at the times when my mom would play his CDs in the car, knowing what a horrible person he was. I've never been so devastated by the revelations about a terrible celebrity than with the Bill Cosby stuff. He was such an icon and one of the first (if not the first) to get a primetime all black casted sitcom that depicted black people as just normal people and not a racist stereotype. It's a true shame that he had to ruin such a career and symbolic legacy with what he did.",

I was crying. ‘No, no, no. Please Bill, no.’ The next thing I remember is Bill ramming himself inside me as I sobbed.”\n\nMatlin detailed other disturbing incidents in her book, saying Hurt verbally attacked her on the night she won her Oscar in 1987. Matlin wrote that Hurt asked her, “What makes you think you deserve it?” while they were sitting in a limo after she became the first deaf actress to ever win an Oscar. “There are hundreds of actors who have worked for years for the recognition you just got handed to you,” he continued. “Think about that.”\n\nIn response, William did not deny the accusations, but instead apologized\n\nhttps://www.eonline.com/ca/news/118654/william-hurt-to-marlee-matlin-i-apologize-for-any-pain-i-caused\n\n\"My own recollection is that we both apologized and both did a great deal to heal our lives.

She also disliked a girl because she made more money than her and she thought she was the star so she got a bunch of the cast to treat the girl badly. When this member asked one of the lackey's Keri hung out with why they didn't include her in anything (years later) they lied and told her they didn't want to corrupt her but in reality, it was because Keri and another member named Ilana were mad she made more money..... Christina AGuilera was also a rude child. She threw a fit because lightening hit the building and she had to wait to record. Britney Spears acted just like her at times. The cast used to run through the set at the start of the show and Christina refused to interact with the fans and walked through bitch faced with Britney following her. That is why they aren't really friends today. Britney didn't like the way she acted when she was with her....",

Duane and Dickie are similar in that they’re both nasty, drunk and have huge chips on their shoulders. But they can play guitar. Dickie is a diva and will break stuff if the tiniest thing doesn’t go his way or he doesn’t like how someone looks at him. \n\nMike Kach played keys with them, tells women when he drunkenly meets them that he wants to “punch you in the c*nt.” Had a benefit for his liver cancer that was caused by... you guessed it... and seems to have kicked it. Can’t get much more of a meaner drunk than him though, and he’s big so hard to carry outta the bar. \n\nDevon Allman seems pretty cool but his brother Michael, out of Bradenton/Tampa, is a drunk loser. He lives off the Allman money and name but gets on stage and can’t remember the words to Melissa. Michael just got another DUI, this time in the Florida Keys (Monroe county). He’s kinda the big embarrassment to the family because he’s not talented and people just like him because he’s an Allman. Devon only let him on stage for 1 song for one of his shows. \n\nBerry Oakley Jr is dumber than rocks. Has like 7 kids with 3 ex wives and can’t afford any of them because he will not get a job. Some of his kids suffered from drug and alcohol use in the womb. His mom is Julia Negron who is now anti drugs and stuff but still uses and drinks herself (or did a few years ago in front of me). She’s on an old show, sally Jessie Raphael I think, talking about being a groupie and doing drugs while pregnant with Berry Jr. His brother Chuckie starred in a tv show about addiction-Intervention or something like that with Barry and Julia and chuck negron (3 Dog Night). \n\nChaz Trippy is nice.

In retrospect, his temperament is often on display when he is interviewed by women. He fraudulently presented himself as a working class hero. In actuality, George and Paul and Ringo were council house kids. John grew up in middle class suburban Woolton living with his rich aunt who looked down on the council estates. John developed his scouse accent purposely. John Lennon often berated his band mates and was very dismissive of Beatles music after we went solo.

So the only way he could keep her alive and get her attention was to pretend to be the brother he likely killed.\n\nPeople like to claim he's asexual but really all evidence suggests he was a pedophile who chose to rape boys. The Llewyn-Davis boys were supposed to go into the care of their aunt, but Barrie altered the will, erasing the sister's name and putting his own in. He wrote about how \"beautiful\" young Michael was when naked. And two of the three boys grew up to commit suicide. One downed himself and his boyfriend in a pond, the oldest threw himself in front of a train in his 60s. The man was a monster who preyed on children and yet a celebrated children's author.",

I’ve heard people say “oh he was framed” and other ridiculousness like that, but FOUR times is too many for it to be a fluke. Also - Roman Polanski. He was convicted of drugging and raping a 13 year old girl in 1977. He agreed to a plea bargain but then fled the country. Admittedly, the judge was going to renege on the deal and possibly sentence him to 50 years in prison. You’d think a child rapist would keep a low profile and be ostracised by his profession , but Nope!

He wanted to “mold her” into his dream wife, and he did everything short of penetrative sex with her from the night they met until they were married. Priscilla wrote that it was “as if her virginity was another thing Elvis strangely and sorely needed to maintain”. According to Priscilla Presley’s biography (Child Bride: The Untold Story of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley) he would bring other women into their bedroom after their marriage and watch and film his wife with them. He also installed a two-way mirror in his house in Palm Springs so he could secretly spy on couples having sex at his lavish parties he would throw. \n\nAfter the birth of their child, Priscilla wrote that Elvis had mentioned before that “he could never make love to a woman who had a child.” After their split in 1972 Elvis went after yet another 14-year-old girl, Reeca Smith, and they were in a relationship for 6 months.\n\nAfter that, Elvis sought out another lover and met Ginger Alden, a 21-year-old he got engaged to and lived with for a while in Graceland. Ginger wrote about his worsening behavior and abuse, particularly with guns in the house. He fired a gun above her head while she was sleeping as an “attention-getter”, fired a gun at a TV, and also ran out of the house carrying a machine gun because he saw a boy with a toy gun.\n\nDespite his history with sexually pursuing children, physical abuse and dangerous emotional reactions, people remember Elvis quite fondly, as a love-loving Southern gentleman taken too soon and led astray by drugs. I’d like to think karma got its kiss for him.",

But Carnegie had resolved that the real purpose was to drive out the unions, only non-union men would be rehired when they reopened the plant.\n\n\"By February of 1885, with the men facing starvation and freezing temperatures and no money to buy food or coal, they agreed to come back in under individual contracts, their wages decreased by up to 33%. The union was crushed forever at the plant.\"\n\nOr this one.\n\nCarnegie played a greater part than is traditionally accepted in the notorious attempt to break a strike at his Homestead works in Pittsburgh in 1892, the deadliest clash between management and labour in US history.\n\n\nCarnegie was holidaying at Skibo Castle in Scotland and directed his company chairman, Henry Clay Frick, to deal with the workers.

His work ethic on the court was remarkable.  He played a clean game.  The accident that took his life was horrific.\n\nBut he raped a woman and then sat back and let his lawyers and a compliant NBA destroy her.  She was humiliated.  Her identity was leaked before the trial.  She was smeared for seeking psychiatric counseling.  Her character was destroyed.  He eventually paid her off so a civil suit would disappear.  But that's not restorative justice.\n\nBryant issued a statement after the case was dropped against him, stating that he thought their sex had been consensual, and that he was wrong.  Of course I don't think he should have had contact with her to make amends, but he paid her off and is now in the process of being canonized.\n\nPeople can grow and change and I think Bryant grew into a better person after this.  At the same time, his victim never received closure and will live with this trauma for the rest of her life, while his later good works and his skill in basketball are lauded and he is enshrined in the firmament.  And that's wrong, or at least not fair.  \n\nThere are celebrities in this comment section who were true bastards.  I don't think Bryant was one of them, but his legacy should not go undisturbed.",

He claimed he wasn't trying to hurt Presley and was upset that his friend would call the police on him.

After the first two round, Campbell felt something was wrong but continued. It didn't help that Baer was being taunted by Tillie \"Kid\" Herman, Campbell's trainer. Baer, of course, went into a rage and begun beating Campbell, only to be stopped by Toby Irwin, the referee. It was after the match, Baer realized what he had done. Campbell's brain was knocked out... for real. Baer was haunted by that and earned his reputation as a killer. \n\nBaer did receive some redemption in 1933 against Max Schmeling, who repented Nazi Germany. Baer, who's a Jew, wore the star of David on his boxer shorts as a middle finger towards the Nazis. Schmeling also saved Jews despite serving for Nazi Germany, BTW.",

He did make music a lot of people love. So it's not like the nicer things said about him weren't also true. But he was still an abusive asshole. He beat his wife, verbally and physically abused anyone who worked with him, people who lived near him said he was insufferable. One of his closest coworkers described him as \"impossible to love\". He was generally just an awful toxic person.",

The Pope issued an order to lift the ban, but his hatred of the Jews overrode his religiousity and the future saint refused. When his efforts to seize all Jewish property, arrest all Jews, and expel them from France in 1268 fell through, he settled for an order that all Jews should be forced to wear a special badge and compelled to attend missionary sermons.\n\nLouis died in Tunis while carrying out his second crusade, not in battle, but from diarrhea, in 1270.",

He was working on a project several years back with Trent Reznor and Reznor required that he move in with him in a house in Louisiana (not sure if that’s his personal residence or was just for work) and he was incredibly controlling. He wouldn’t let him leave or have any kind of life, he wanted him to work 24/7. He also was really degrading and condescending and wanted full credit for all work done. My friends brother eventually said fuck it and abandoned the project because he just couldn’t put up with Reznor. \n\nSting also seems like a massive dick. For example, he has sole writing credits for the song Every Breath You Take despite the fact that the other two members of the police wrote their own instrumental parts without his input. When Puff Daddy used the guitar part from that song as a sample, Sting sued for copyright and won. Since the song was released, he has made $700,000 a year in royalties even though the only part of the song sampled was the guitar riff which Sting DID  NOT WRITE.

He was also an *insanely* racist piece of shit who, amongst other atrocities:\n\n* Defended the concentration camps that were built in South Africa.\n\n* Gladly joined in the reconquering of Sudan, bragging that he killed multiple \"savages.\"\n\n* Happily took part in \"a lot of jolly little wars against barbarous peoples.\"\n\n* Unleashed the infamous Black and Tan thugs on the civilian population of Ireland in the 20s.\n\n* Was in favour of using poison gas against \"uncivilized tribes,\" claiming it would spread \"a lively terror.\"\n\n* Flatly refused to allow food aid to India during the 1943 famine, even going so far as to blame the Indians for the famine for \"breeding like rabbits.\"\n\n* Gladly supported British imperialism, claiming it was really motivated by an altruistic desire to elevate \"lower races.\"\n\n* Ordered the clearing out of the local Kikuyu in Kenya, calling them \"brutish children.\"\n\n* With regard to the above: basically established a gulag in Kenya to quash the movement for Kenyan independence.  They tortured people with things like electrocution, cigarettes, fire, and whips.  In fact, you probably know a descendant of one of these tortured people: former President Obama.  His grandfather was amongst those sent to the gulag and was routinely tortured, experiencing things that scarred him for life.\n\nAgain, yes, he helped stop Hitler.  But that doesn't stop Churchill from being a monstrous piece of imperialistic shit.",

Nancy was heavily medicated for her mental issues from a young age and was sent to a psych facility by her family for a temporary amount of time (I believe). Both were involved in drugs when they met, but both spiraled into a cycle that ended in both of their deaths. \n\nAs someone whose been in the punk community for awhile now (I was and still am the token \"alt\" kid) it's really sad that people treat them like Romeo and Juliet or the moronic \"Love Kills\" phrase from the movie. A lot of the e girl types tend to take this couple who was dominant during the early punk scene and twist their romance into a fetish for them and their high school boyfriend (typically) to wear fake lockets around.
