Even now we are both still struggling with it. You don't just get into a serious relationship moving as fast as these people do in movies, I mean which makes sense, otherwise it would be an insanely long movie, but still. It would be more realistic if they did not really \"get into it\" without any worries about each other and move so fast and all that if the characters are described as shy and/or socially awkward. I just don't think it ever works like that and it would be fine if the relationship was much simpler, especially if the story doesn't necessarily revolve only around that relationship.

Taking two bites of a meal then leaving. \n\n3. People talking past each other- people give irrelevant answers to direct questions, and these answers are always just accepted without comment. There was a good example of this in a recent episode of FATWS but I can‚Äôt remember the lines. Usually it‚Äôs something like:\n\n> CHARACTER 1: What were you doing at the mall?\n\n> CHARACTER 2: You followed me!?\n\n> CHARACTER 1: You know what, I‚Äôm too hungry for this right now. \n\n> CHARACTER 2: *Hangs up.*\n\n> CHARACTER 1: *Hangs up. Does not eat.*\n\n4. Characters who live in cities knowing intimate details about neighbor‚Äôs lives. I know this does happen for some people, but most places I‚Äôve lived, I didn‚Äôt even know my neighbors names. Not saying either is better or worse, it‚Äôs just uncommon, in my experience, to be close to neighbors. \n\n5. Big sports fans who wear a blank, generic jersey and hold the ball of the sport they‚Äôre watching while it‚Äôs on TV. They also immediately stop paying attention to the game and/or leave to do literally anything else that comes up, no matter how inconsequential. \n\n6. Everyone is a cop or has a close personal relationship with one. This is probably skewed by the fact that CBS has about 12 police procedurals on air at any given time, but if you broaden your definition of cop to include FBI, military intelligence, etc. tons of shows and movies use them- and their all powerful algorithms- as deus ex machina to get out of tons of plot problems. \n\n7. Head trauma. More common in sci-fi / fantasy. But ‚Äúknocking someone out‚Äù is giving them such a bad concussion that their brain says ‚Äúnope‚Äù and shuts off. It‚Äôs not the totally harmless way of incapacitating someone as it‚Äôs usually presented to be. Even just one of these can have long term mental repercussions. Multiple, and you‚Äôre looking at CTE, higher risk for Parkinson‚Äôs, depression, and suicide later in life. \n\nI‚Äôm sure I could think of a few more, but most others have probably already been mentioned.\n\nEdit: Who the hell is downvoting every comment that includes the phone call thing? It‚Äôs really common in media and very not common IRL lol",

This is RAYNA.*\n\n**RAYNA:** Good morning, Ben.     \n**BEN:** Good morning, Rayna. Gosh, isn't it great how we say each other's names?      \n\n*An unseen audience laughs.*\n\n**RAYNA:** Yes, most siblings wouldn't be so formal.      \n\n*More laughter is heard.*\n\n**BEN:** I also appreciate how you mention that we're brother and sister.      \n**RAYNA:** It's almost as though I'm providing details for an unseen audience.\n\n*Still more laughter becomes audible. Ben nods, then turns his attention back to the refrigerator.*\n\n**BEN:** We should talk about our mutual lack of gainful employment, then.      \n**RAYNA:** It's certainly incongruous with this enormous living space.       \n**BEN:** How will we ever explain that?      \n**RAYNA:** We won't.\n\n*The audience bursts into uproarious laughter.*\n\n**BEN:** Have you ever noticed how very little of what we say is actually funny?       \n**RAYNA:** I'm hilarious. *You're* the unfunny one.\n\n*Yet again, the audience laughs.*\n\n**BEN:** That's another thing: Most of the time, we're just mean to each other.      \n**RAYNA:** We're siblings, though, so it's okay.      \n**BEN:** Yeah, but... but we're mean to *everyone*.\n\n*As if on cue, a second young man walks into the room. This is ROB.*\n\n**ROB:** Hi, guys! I just let myself in uninvited, despite not living here.       \n**BEN:** You're a dick, Rob.\n\n*The audience laughs.*\n\n**ROB:** I'm going to openly hit on your sister in front of you.      \n**RAYNA:** You're a dick, Rob.\n\n*The audience laughs.*\n\n**BEN:** Hey, so, Rob... are we going to do something vaguely entertaining today?       \n**ROB:** Yes.

There would be so many meetings between the initial referral to removal. \n\nWorked for social services in the U.K.(not a social worker, just attended a lot of meetings) and when I did, they would have a meeting with professionals to discuss the concerns or initial referral. If the concerns were serious it would lead to an initial child protection conference. At this meeting, you go over the concerns and a plan is put in place to get the parenting up to an acceptable level. The plan is reviewed and if there are still concerns or the situation has got worst, you have a review child protection. This probably doesn‚Äôt cover other meetings between the initial meeting and initial CP conference or meetings between the initial CP conference and Review CP conference.\n\nIf there are still concerns, the children will moved to foster care (if they‚Äôre not already in foster care). They would look at either putting a plan in place for the children to return to birth parents or they plan for adoption. But to get to that point there are still meetings and court hearings which can take years.\n\nFor a parent to lose custody permanently, the first steps would be around obtaining a placement order which gives the local authority permission to look at permanent placements whether that be in foster care or adoption. However for a child to never return to birth parents, adopters would seek an adoption order which is given adopters legal rights over the children they‚Äôve adopted.

People rave about how funny it is. I had a friend swear it was the best comedy he'd seen.  \nI watched it and it was disturbing how fast they talk to each other. With ZERO pauses. Just rapid-fire talk. Back and forth. No one talks like that in real life. And even if they did, no one can think that fast to pop off witty little retorts and quips in a matter of seconds. It seems so damn scripted and unreal.  \nCouple that with me not finding the content funny and I just couldn't get into it.  \n\nAnd another \"flawless convo\" thing that ties in with this that's cringy to me is how there will be a conversation with 6 people in it and literally ONE person talks at a time while everyone stays completely quiet. As if to not ruin a scene.  \nBonus cringe points if they finish each other's sentences.  \nLike they just know to stop talking at that moment and let their buddy finish the line for dramatic effect.\n\nEdit: Fixed a couple typos and added last paragraph.",

I can't help but feel that the white-washing of medicine and disease in media has contributed to a culture that has a severely unhealthy and toxic relationship with death and disability. \n\nOh, and if CPR doesn't work, [you get your ribs cracked](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560863/) open like a clamshell and the staff will grab your heart with their hands and squeeze it until it starts beating on its own again, if it ever does-- which it probably won't.\n\n**Edit**: disclaimer that I'm plagiarizing my own comment for this.

You‚Äôll always get interrupted if even shut up somehow.\n\nBut also not many people ever talk like they know exactly what to say in a situation. They‚Äôll know *after* what they should have said but rarely during. Even I‚Äôve had my moments in rl but they are few.\n\nAnd men are usually given way too much thoughtful dialog for what they usually say in rl. EG: Gilmore girls, like many soap opera or drama is rife with this. No guy I know talks like that. Do they mean to? Probably. Maybe? They probably could have much of this thought process. Do they say it? Not until you tell them what kinda torture they just said and then they go ‚Äòoh no I meant -‚Äò and they need help to get to what they meant. They never just know off hand what they mean they are going to say until the mistake has been made the first time.\n\n\n**DEATH AND INJURY:**\n\nTo kill a person on film is like trying to kill the undead where unless it‚Äôs a headshot, it doesn‚Äôt count. And even then, it‚Äôs super likely the person will survive if even just have a slight headache.\n\nSevere injuries, getting shot anywhere on the body and the behaviour of pushing through it where a few shots later it is like walking on a light sprain. Just ‚Äòwalk it off‚Äô\n\nAdrenaline is well overplayed as a super power than what it actually is in real life. And shock is under played for how it actually is in life.\n\n**READING**\n \nSo many shows a character will hand over a novel length pile of printed papers and almost always the person receiving will just look down for a second and say ‚ÄúEGADS!‚Äù Or something  like this that you couldn‚Äôt read even one word that fast and understand completely what the entire document is saying\n\n**COMPUTERS**\n\nDownloading stuff is too quick and rarely have any technical issues. In rl you have to format that thumb drive first.\n\nNot everyone has a MacBook.\n\nHacking is way too complex and flashy for what it usually is and hacking computer and wifi passwords are not as easy as learning that person‚Äôs pet hamster‚Äôs name. Realistically it‚Äôs actually easier but rarely seen on tv: search around the desk for the notepad with the ‚Äòoh so encrypted‚Äô password book cuz technology life has too many passwords to guess even for the person who made them. Often the book even says ‚Äòpasswords‚Äô right on it. Silicon Valley got this accurate.",

Fell for this myself, tbh - had no idea how bad my eyes really were until being tested years later). \n\nHopefully it's going to die with screens in general being so much part of our lifes now pretty much everyone needs glasses.\n\nEdit: And honestly - why should we aspire not to wear glasses?

Some of the most unrealistic dialogue that‚Äôs in every movie.. It‚Äôs so refreshing to see a genuine and realistic communication style. Let me think of a movie or two for examples. Manos - the way every person in the movie acts is as if it‚Äôs 100% real life and I love it. I get invested in the emotions, in the fear, in the thrill, the risk. Also the lighthouse. A movie of the opposite where I feel the portrayal is very poor is something like bloodshot or sonic the hedgehog. In sonic, the main guy actor is just a ‚Äúgood ol dude‚Äù but he‚Äôs an unrealistic ass licker. So many scenes are directed in a way you would say, ‚Äúnobody would be like this in real life..‚Äù just my IMO I guess. I don‚Äôt know where to draw the line in fantasy films and this. Like how do you portray a realistic communication style in a mad max or lord of the rings type film where you have to create it. For the most part I think LOTD is well done, but I find the idea fascinating of teaming with scientists or doing lots of research and time into making the actual dialogue more realistic.

Are you an obese old man who just happened to kidnap a person? Are you an armed police officer? Are you a psychopathic murderer?\n\nYou could be all of these, you could be none. But you all have one thing in common. \n\nThe hero will defeat you.\n\nHe will fly, he will soar, he will be beaten to pulp and still rise magnificently, he will be shot, punched, kicked. He is invincible. Such invincibility that even physics, in all its austerity, hath bowed its head. \n\nThe heroine has her power too. The hero may be nearly dead, may be in coma, may be on his deathbed, but should she call for her lover once, he shall come running to avenge her. It is the power of love. It traverses oceans and anesthesia. It is encompassing.\n\n2. **Courting.**\nIn most Indian movies, live is a very essential element. A fragile heroine is a must. One who‚Äôs IQ is low enough to struggle with basic addition, but who is somehow adept at the skill of making up. This heroine you see, is merely an accessory to our leading lad. \n\nNow how does he court this lady you may ask.\n\nHe does not. \n\nInstead he stalks her as she goes about her daily chores, singing songs and randomly appearing with friends in the most absurd places possible.\n\nAnd when he has utilized every drop of his creative courtship, a situation presents itself in which he must fight to save the lady or her interests. It is ultimately in this fight, that the lady swoons and becomes smitten with our lord.\n\n3. Is the story set in college life? Fear not. You won‚Äôt be seeing anyone actually studying. Forget about studying, teachers might not even exist. The college was only chosen cause it‚Äôs a nice location. Much greenery, few money. \nNo one will ever study but the hero will top the class and bag a brilliant job. The power of young love my folks.\n\n4. I‚Äôll update later I‚Äôm tired it‚Äôs 2 am.",

Using information only the target would know, but would still think it's strange to say (I'm looking at you, Geostorm!)\n5. Endless rounds in a small handgun. I get it, reloading isn't the sexiest thing to watch, but it adds to the realism. I've seen *a few* movies where the bullets get counted, and clips changed. Having said that, I don't know anyone who carries around 500+ fully-loaded magazines full of bullets during their daily walk.",

That is particularly strong when it comes to social and societal experiences - we are social beings at a fundamental level.  Check out Bandura‚Äôs work, read the fun Gladwell books, or recall all those lectures on ‚Äúpeer pressure‚Äù we received growing up.  This isn‚Äôt as simple as saying we either are or aren‚Äôt impacted by behaviors and trends around us - this is more like a spectrum, as *ALL* of us are impacted by what we take in and perceive.\n\nEven those of us who consider ourselves ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù or more on the introverted side of things - we might get it but in different ways or sources from those around us.\n\nI don‚Äôt care who you are, you (yes you, reader) fill that hole somehow, from somewhere, and take in values, interests, codified communication, humor, social relational engagement styles, etc.  We. All. Do.\n\nNow, what we suck at as a species is parsing through what is *real* vs what is fictional.\nIt doesn‚Äôt actually appear to really matter what the source is - we are impacted on a psychological level, at least to certain extents, by what we take in.\n\nTo the overall question - we see typified method of interacting with others in media all the time. We are impacted by what we see on Insta and TikTok (not Reddit, it‚Äôs special amarite?) in similar ways that we take in news media information, in the same way that we soak up how relationships ‚Äúshould‚Äù look from F.R.I.E.N.D.S. or The Office.\n\nHow often have we watched a popular show or read about / saw lives of others and felt shitty about our own experiences? Or lack thereof?\n\nHow often do we (consciously or otherwise) note methods of interacting with others *heavily* based on what we consume?\n\nHonestly, this is only seems to be a problem as much as it causes issues or impacts confidence. \nBut we truly do learn language/communication/interpersonal approaches from society and from circles we involve ourselves in.  Both good as well as problematic habits.\n\nTo hit close to home for several of us, I am starting to believe we on a societal level are getting less direct interaction with others, norming ourselves from ourselves, and instead are starting to accidentally fill in more and more blanks with media representations of how social relationships are depicted.  We might end up fine with fewer problems when *supplementing* with some media-based habits - but we‚Äôre finding that limited social engagement with primary sources of this needs-fulfillment coming from fictional (or non-direct (many would suggest social media to be just as ‚Äúfictional‚Äù as a show/movie)) sources can begin to cause problems.\n\nWe‚Äôre basing significant processes on less substantial stuff.  Said another way: We‚Äôre eating junk food and expecting to be healthy. Then feeling like crap about ourselves when we aren‚Äôt healthy.\n\nIn short: Since we suck at differentiating between real and fiction, surrounding self with fiction in combo with minimizing opportunities to engage in ‚Äúreal‚Äù leaves us acting weird or not able to get what we need psychologically.\n\nAnd that, redditors, is my Ted Talk on why anime accidentally makes people terrible.\n\nEdit: Words for clarity.",

Some common inaccuracies:\n\n* In movies guns are far less accurate than they really are. It's not nearly as hard to hit someone in reality compared to how it is depicted in most movie shooting scenes.\n* In many movie scenes involving guns, people are often depicted firing while standing out completely in the open. In reality, even the most inexperienced person using a gun would know to seek and fire from cover.\n* In fight scenes with guns and melee combat, bad guys with guns almost always run *towards* the protagonist... It looks cool when they get their gun kicked from their hands perhaps, but in reality they would actually use the gun for it's very purpose -- to inflict damage from a distance. This is one of my biggest pet-peeves in Hollywood movie fight scenes -- why are people with guns running to engage in melee range?!\n* When people are shot or stabbed in movies, especially the \"extras\", they usually die almost instantly. In reality, death is far slower and more painful. Most movie gun deaths would be from bleeding out rather than the \"insta-kill\" that is portrayed.\n* Anyone who has actually engaged in fight training or at least watched MMA fights knows that being \"knocked out\" does not mean you are out cold for 30+ minutes as often portrayed in movies. In reality it would be more like 30 seconds, during which time you are not necessarily completely still but more like in a dazed state. You *can* knock someone **completely out** so they are slumped on the ground entirely unconscious and unmoving, but that lasts at most a minute or two before the person starts slowly regaining consciousness, and it's not something you can replicate 100% of the time with every person.\n\n**Bonus:**\n\nNot specifically fighting, but in terms of action sequences: **explosion effects are almost entirely unrealistic.** First of all, most things you see in movies such as cars, helicopters, planes, etc. would not just spontaneously explode even if on fire. Vehicles, especially passenger vehicles, are specifically engineered for safety, and the fuel tanks are carefully designed so they would not explode in the event of even the most devastating crash. You could press the nozzle of a blowtorch directly into the gas tank port of your car and your car still wouldn't explode. The gas would ignite and you would almost certainly get burned, but your car wouldn't \"explode into the air sending shrapnel everywhere\". (please don't try this at home)\n\n* [Gas tanks, even when fired at with incendiary rounds, will not explode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIo_0qBR8nU).\n* [Most explosions you see in movies have added fireworks and special effects that look nothing like they would in reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqJiWbD08Yw)",

Some examples:\n\n1: When checking somebody in, they hand room keys out an say the room number out loud to anybody that can hear. We typically won't do this, as it is a security risk for our guests.\n\n2: Just taking somebody's word that they are who they say they are. When a person checks in, we get their ID to verify that they are who they say they are, and if the name and face don't match the person standing in front of us, we will deny them entry.\n\n3: Housekeeping does not just let people into rooms. They will only do so if they know 100% that you are the person checked into that room, and even then they normally won't as they could lose their jobs if that isn't the correct person.\n\n4: I'll see people head to the desk in shows and movies and say they have an issue, and just tell the person at the desk without giving their name or room number. Unless it's the same person that checked you in, we don't know who you are, and even if we were the same one, there's a good chance we don't remember you, simply because we see so many people everyday.\n\n5: Giving people's room numbers out. I will see police come in and ask for a person's room number, or a random person will do it, and the desk agent just tells them. In real life, unless we called the police, or they say someone called, or there is a warrant, we won't even tell a person's room number to them. This is double for random people. Unless the guest has said specifically that someone is coming in, we don't just give the room number out.\n\nI'm sure there are more, but this post is long enough as it is. Point is, my line of work is majorly skewed, and it ends up having real life effects while there, because everybody expects us to act like they do on tv and movies, when in reality we are a lot more strict.

BOB!‚Äù And everyone is like ‚Äúwtf?‚Äù And he repeats it again and asks ‚Äúis it a good name?‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôd be so annoyed if someone did it IRL though. Why be dramatic about it lol",

The only exception is if they have went out of their way to make it an entire character trait. \n\nAnother thing I hate with newer TV series is the lack of background noise in a ton of scenes, they'll be in a busy restaurant there will be kids and people moving plates about but the conversation sounds like their having it in the vacuum of space. Nothing takes me out of these things more than the weird sound decisions, like if the conversation is important and needs to be heard, don't have them somewhere busy or noisy, or do have it in a restaurant but make it early or late so no one else is there. Don't just have them in a busy place and mute the world because it sticks out like a sore thumb.",

            "text": "Space battles. Just‚Äîall of it.\n\nI know we still have a ways to go on the final frontier and space vehicles for combat applications are probably decades to a century away, but as someone with intuitive understanding of orbital mechanics, the old-school dogfighting in Star Wars, visible lasers/phasers in Star Trek, and certain cutscenes of Mass Effect just look‚Ä¶‚Äùwrong‚Äù to me. I mean, they‚Äôre still spectacular-looking and fun to watch, but spacecraft don‚Äôt need control surfaces, larger vessels seem to have a lot of armour and shields but no weapons, and drones are almost unheard of.\n\nMost modern air-to-air combat takes place at BVR (beyond visual range); any closer than that and neither the pilot nor the plane will be able to react fast enough‚Äîand that‚Äôs just between two aircraft travelling at Mach 1-2.5. A combat orbital rendezvous will, depending on where you are, how far away you are from it, and at what angle you are intercepting, occur at much, *much* greater speeds, with perhaps between a few seconds to a full minute of combat viability before both crafts go flying out of range. All weapons would *have* to be controlled by computer; there is no way a human operator would be able to lead a nigh-invisible target potentially hundreds of kilometres away and moving at the tens of kilometres per second.\n\nAlso, all weapons have theoretically unlimited range, but also a maximum *effective* range: lasers suffer from diffraction, which can be mitigated somewhat by using shorter wavelengths, a larger aperture/spot size, and having more than one turret, but not overcome as it is an inherent property of light; kinetic weapons are limited by their muzzle velocity‚Äîif your gun can fire shots at ten kilometres per second (by the way, a coilgun can do that, given sufficient power), an enemy craft a thousand kilometres away would have a hundred seconds to detect your shot and move out of the way. Particle beam weapons require a *lot* of energy to work, while plasma weapons would barely work at all; without a self-containing, self-propelling electromagnetic field, the plasma would quickly dissipate and disperse into a cloud of expanding, cooling gas. Nuclear weapons would be quite effective, but like lasers, would also diffract; however, they would also emit a huge burst of ionising radiation that would be rather problematic for anyone nearby. They would also require the UN to cancel the Partial Test Ban Treaty, which prohibits the use of nuclear weapons in space.\n\nWeapons produce a ton of heat‚Äîthe reason why military recruits spend a lot of their early training disassembling and reassembling their rifles is to drill the process into muscle memory so that they would be able to swap out an overheated barrel while under fire. In space, all that heat would have to be siphoned from weapons systems and vented by‚Ä¶deploying massive panels of heat radiation gear. There is no atmosphere in space for heat to convect away; black-body radiation is the rule of law in the cosmos, and the higher the temperature, the more effective the radiator is‚Äîyet, the higher the temperature, the more visible you are to infrared and passive sensors, and the weaker structural integrity will be, especially at very high temperatures. The panels themselves could be armoured at the cost of their effectiveness (lowered coefficient of emissivity), though the armour would also need to be heat resistant. And finally, you can‚Äôt just dump all that heat into the radiators all at once; depending on the coefficient of thermal expansion of whatever material it‚Äôs made of, it‚Äôd most likely shatter or warp out of shape, damaging the heat pipes that carry the coolant within.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs not even getting into the logistics of it all. Weapons aren‚Äôt the only things that produce heat; crew modules, power generators, and the odd doodad here and there will need radiators of their own. Humans have an overhead cost (food, water, oxygen, and entertainment), each crew member *must* serve a purpose (otherwise, they would be a literal waste of resources and a burden on the crew in the form of mass ratio) and are irreplaceable; for this reason, I hypothesise humans aboard combat spacecraft would have to have multiple roles and duties as a matter of redundancy. From this point of view, a single-occupant fighter craft just makes no sense aside from ‚Äúlooking cool‚Äù; the fighter has to carry just enough propellant to execute four Hohmann transfer burns, it can‚Äôt have any windows because they are structural weaknesses, its rocket engines would have to be powerful enough to manoeuvre out of the line of fire but not so much that it kills the pilot due to acceleration, and the weapons have to powerful enough to whittle away at an enemy craft‚Äôs armour, but still small and energy efficient enough to fit into the fighter‚Äôs tiny frame. The pilot will also have to be dressed in a bulky pressure suit (because life support systems are massive, expensive, energy-consuming, and quite fragile), be foolhardy enough to get into the craft, and accept the fact that if anything were to happen to them, they will most likely die in space. Kamikaze pilots aside, I hardly see this as a promising career choice. Perhaps, single-occupant space vehicles will have a place as for remote drone commanders who direct entire fleets of drones into battle.\n\nAnd finally, tactics is perhaps most egregious of all: to disable a spacecraft, just disable propulsion by targeting the propellant tanks and rocket engines; if it has no Œîv, you can just leave them in orbit to rot. Failing that, target the radiators for the crew modules, power generation systems, weapons, and so forth. Or, just slowly run them out of propellant by taking advantage of orbital mechanics; if you‚Äôre cunning enough, you can manoeuvre them into a suborbital trajectory from which they can‚Äôt escape. Even the best Whipple shields/deflectors/kinetic barriers cannot withstand constant bombardment and concentrated fire. Boarding a ship to take prisoners would be a challenge, though; assuming the crew modules are still intact, well, there‚Äôs no cover in a three-dimensional fight, depressurisation will kill you faster (and more painfully) than a bullet, and Newton‚Äôs Third Law will make firing a gun or throwing a punch difficult. I‚Äôd recommend tossing in a few flashbang grenades *before* going in with guns blazing.\n\nAnd‚Ä¶yeah, that about sums it up. >!I can‚Äôt believe I wrote seven whole paragraphs on the subject of unrealistic space battles.!< For a more realistic depiction of space combat, the game *Children of a Dead Earth* is a start (it has a subreddit: r/COADE).

In the episode *Fatal* of *Criminal Minds*, in brief dialogue and fortunately no flashbacks, when asked a question, the villain mentions that when he and his friend (both six years old) were on a camping trip with parents, it begun snowing, the two separated, the villain made it out alive, but his friend did not. People blamed him for it (as he pointed out anyway, though he did not say who or exactly how many), imagine being only six years old, having a friend of yours die, as if you are not feeling terrible enough, and people actually blame you for it. I have an idea, why not blame the parents, who in their right mind would blame a child especially that young? They think if they did not separate, his friend would still be alive. Perhaps it was merely out of sadness and anger, but still, no justification, and though not given exactly the reason, the entire ordeal gave the villain PTSD making him take antidepressants. His empathetic teacher visited him in the hospital and showed him a Greek mythology book, which unbeknownst, much later in life, turned him into a killer. What a childhood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can give you tons of other examples, which I probably will later, but I wanted to say this one separate, since I cannot think of many people who would actually do that. I have actually heard of six year olds actually being blamed for things, as serious as this, perhaps people even taking it much further.

If your 1st man dont have sharp eyes and see the bad guy with the AR first (which most of the time is the case), you' have a bad time.\n\nShooting: you dont do it without ear protection, especially indoors. Guns are loud as fuck when you shoot it, which takes us to supressors, the only difference they make is that instead of \"holy fuck that was loud\", you'll say \"that was loud\".\n\nShooting someone/getting shot: Life is not like in the movies, bad guys not alwaya drop dead with 1 or 2 shota, especially if you shooting small callibers like 9mm, you can and should expect that someone you hit 5 times with a handgun probably still represents a threat to you, the same goes to the hero that gets shot/survives a explosion a few feet in front of him, wakes up a few hours later ready to take down some bad guys. Shock waves exists and they can cause chaos in one's body, google Thermobaric Bomb for more. Getting shot may not hurt untill some time passes, sometimes you dont even feel it, but when the shock and the adrenaline rush passes, it'll hurt like hell.\n\nKnife/close quarters combat: if you follow the example from movies with acrobatic maneuvers and all those weird movements you'll get fucked before you even realise. The simplier and the faster your attack is, the best. There's no secret movements to fight a knife-welding opponent when he's close to you, all you can say is \"fuck it, I'll get stabbed anyway, might aswell try and take this fucker down\" or simply run if you can, most of the times you'll have no chance to run tho, a knife-armed opponent knows that he needa to get close to you for his weapon to be efficient, so he wont show his toy unless he is close enough and/or there's no way to run, that's why you should always keep your distance if someone gets confrontational with you, a knife can be as dangerous as a gun, or maybe even more. Always remember: your vest is made to stop bullets, not knifes.\n\nAccuracy: to be honest, there is none when it comes to self-defense guns when you shooting anything that is 7 meters or farther. Handguns aren't known to be precise, of course it can hit 1 or 2 shots, but a btoken clock gets the hours right at least once a day.\nLong guns are somewhat different, the projectile itself works on a different way, but you could say it is more precise, but in the end it doesnt matter since most of the time you dont know where your target is, and when you know, you have no time to take aim. Knifes are the most precise weapon a soldier can use, no need to tell you why.",

A close second in terribleness is how involved doctors are portrayed in this fictions. When you're in a hospital for just about anything, your doctor is going to be involved with about 1% (or less) of your total care. Nurses and aides/techs do the vast majority of patient care, blood draws, test results, and just about everything else that comes to mind. This isn't to say doctors aren't busy during their shift because they're definitely working hard behind the scenes, but it isn't during the hands-on care of a patient. As a patient in a hospital, if you're there a week, expect to see your doctor a total of 10 minutes or less during that time. The people you regularly interact with will be nurses, aides/techs, phlebotomists, therapists of some sort, janitorial, etc etc etc.......

In reality, the glue of a friend circle eventually thins & loses it's \"stick\" after betrayals and insults.
