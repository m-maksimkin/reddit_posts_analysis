If you call someone an idiot while factually proving them wrong, you're actually just heightening the chance they'll double down and refuse to concede they were wrong. If you respectfully present the facts to them and perhaps even do so with a tone of \"I get the feeling someone fed you bad information,\" (moving guilt/responsibility away from them, basically) it gives them an out that they'll happily jump on since they realize they'd look like an idiot for holding onto their belief.\n\nDespite this, we live in a cancel culture where we try to dogpile people and shout at them for harboring a certain stance, without ever explaining why. (or if done so, then done in the most disrespectful manner ever) It doesn't work, and just leads to more hostility between people. Like I've encountered discussions where, random example, it was considered sexist to acknowledge women have smaller brains, so suddenly half the room is refusing to speak to the other half about the topic and labeling them sexist/pressuring them to stop talking when....wtf just let the discussion continue. Science doesn't even support the idea this leads to a lower IQ, but when we freak out on this fact and don't let people finish their statement because we're trained to shun anyone we disagree with, then we're actually just escalating what could be easily defused if you let them finish their thought: you let the discussion unfold because the discussion will provide evidence in your favor, whilst shunning them is more likely to create an effect where certain members of the opposition may entertain the thought that maybe brain size *does* have importance that certain people don't want them to know about.\n\nBest example of social pressure misused in social media, imo, is Jontron. Couple years ago he took part in a debate and said some genuinely racist things. (basically implying black people were genetically less intelligent or prone to more crime) Thing is, the discussion itself was fairly calm and respectful and Jon was doing poorly against any counter-claims presented. I 100% feel if the internet just let things continue alongside that path and linked his twitter to more evidence to the contrary (respectfully), then yes, they could've flipped his opinions. The internet being the internet however, he was dogpiled for being a racist and shouted down with social pressure. Jon himself even asked for more civil discussion without \"witchhunting each other.\" \n\nThe bitter irony here is that I feel what won't be acknowledged is....say Jon goes on to do something racist someday. Society will point the finger and take no responsibility even though we had a clear opportunity to change this.\n\nI feel this genuinely effects a lot of things. Reddit LOVES hating on anti-vaxxers for example, and I'd argue reddit is partially responsible for how many of them there are. They log in, see all the propaganda against them, then double down on their beliefs whilst some others ask \"why does reddit want me to believe this so badly...?\" Talk respectfully about vaccinations and how they function and this wouldn't happen, but unfortunately the average human is faaaaaaaaaaaar too eager to be smug about their perceived superiority to do this. It's just a bunch of people trying to validate themselves by loudly proclaiming \"Ha! I certainly am smarter and superior to group X!\" and unfortunately the fallout is that animosity develops, misinformation rises (since a civil debate never comes to light and people instead scatter about to their own sources, some of which are terrible), and whilst one half adopts a bad stance, the other remains blissfully ignorant to how toxic and dangerous their approach is.",

Your blood alcohol content is what determines how drunk you are. Drinking 10 units of beer will get you just as drunk as 10 units of vodka, or  5 units of each. \n\n2) The idea that different types of alcohol cause you to behave differently. Nope. Again, it's just your blood alcohol content. It doesn't matter whether it's aged in an oak barrel, or distilled with juniper berries, or made from 100% blue agave. No, tequila doesn't \"make you crazy\". Stop using it as an excuse to cheat on your boyfriend. No, whisky doesn't \"make you angry\". Stop using it as an excuse to be violent.\n\n\n3) The idea that alcohol kills brain cells. The amount of alcohol needed to kill a brain cell would also kill the person drinking it. Excessive alcohol consumption over a prolonged period of time can damage dendrites in the brain, but the brain cells themselves will be fine.\n\n4) The idea that you can't mix antibiotics and alcohol*. The vast majority of antibiotics are fine to be mixed with alcohol. This is a misconception that dates back to the heydays of syphilis. At the time, antibiotics were commonly prescribed to treat syphilis. Doctors wanted the patients to avoid alcohol while the antibiotics were doing their thing, because alcohol increases promiscuity. They didn't want people to spread their syphilis. \n\n\\* That said, there are 2 or 3 specific antibiotics for which alcohol is contraindicated, as with those specific combinations, you have a higher chance of vomiting out the antibiotic. But that's a handful out of literally hundreds.",

A ten-second skim of the Wikipedia page makes that clear, but apparently no one bothers to do that before jumping to a conclusion.\n\nI‚Äôm willing to entertain the idea that someone might have bribed prison officials to make it easier for Epstein to kill himself (although even then, one of the major variables‚Äîthe guards not checking him‚Äîseems to have been due entirely to fatigue), but the idea that an assassin entered his cell and strangled him is a way shakier claim than the memes make it sound.\n\n(While we‚Äôre on the subject, acting like anyone who‚Äôs ever been photographed standing next to Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell must be a paedophile is also nonsense. I don‚Äôt even think being on the famous flight logs is the smoking gun people make it out to be, given that Epstein was known to host a lot of non-creepy social events and network with people for business reasons).",

            "text": "almost every \"covid prevention measure\" from masks, to social distancing, to over sanitizing.\n\nTLDR?: Conspiracy theories about government control aside: COV19 prevention practices are not based behind any science, and existing science and ongoing research is increasingly proving the point that the measures are useless a best, and doing more harm than good at worst\n\nHeres the facts about masks:\n\n\\-There are only two \"masks\" (that are technically respirators not actually masks) that prevent the spread of catching or spreading disease: a p100 or N95; this also only works if you have been fit tested for them, maintain a proper seal, and have no facial hair or major scarring/deformity. The p100 and N95 are also designed to be single use only and disposed of in a biohazard waste container when used in known contact with highly communicable and dangerous diseases; If worn to just protect from the common cold though or other similar less dangerous diseases they can be reused. These respirators also ONLY protect you from AIRBORNE diseases, they are not designed to protect against droplets, or non airborne diseases, they only filter out particulate matter AND YES THEY DO REDUCE OXYGEN INTAKE, so yes you NEED to be medically certified that you are healthy enough to wear on for extended periods of time.\n\nRegular surgical masks are only effective in two situations: acting as a physical barrier to prevent droplets from spreading as far (but if the disease is on the droplets those droplets still will be in the immediate area of an individual or things they touch, they do NOT keep the virus from spreading, they just limit how far in can travel from infected individuals),and to protect surgical patients from the surgeons droplets because they are literally being operated on with a huge open wound.\n\nsome side notes and food for thought: Surgeons wear the masks because surgical PT's have exposed insides, normal people walking around don't.\n\nIf you are asymptomatic you wont spread droplets unless you tend to spit when you talk (nasty ass) or cough/sneeze without covering your mouth\n\nIf you sneeze into your mask that literally could kill you: youre breathing back in the shit you just sneezed, you sneezed because your body is getting rid of a potential health risk.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nsocial distancing facts:\n\nNot really much to say here except that it simply doesn't actually do anything.\n\nstanding 6feet away from someone is not an actual safe distance to prevent the spread of any disease, an actual safer distance would be about half a football field length up to max of an entire football field length distance between individuals. \n\nAlso Social distancing measures are null and void in a lot of circumstances such as airplanes where you social distance in the airport to avoid being in close contact with people....only to sit in close proximity to up to 8 other people (provided you are in the middle seat with three in the seat in front and back of you and 2 on each side of your row). \n\nLastly social distancing in regards to inanimate objects is just baffling to the sane mind. Keeping shopping carts from touching each other isnt going to keep the shopping carts (or shoppers) any safer. Same with loading groceries on the belt or what not\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFacts about over sanitizing: \n\nthis one is the simplest of all: Antibiotic resistant bacteria/ Treatment resistant diseases.\n\nthe more we sanitize and clean shit that REALLY DOESNT need to be cleaned every 5 seconds, the more bacteria and viruses and other diseases are able to adapt to be able to spread under those over sanitized circumstances. This is why taking your full dose of antibiotics is important and not taking them for every single cold.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_",

Top selling cars are trucks and SUVs even though most people who have them don‚Äôt really need the features. Racing culture is glorified, you can buy cars that are designed to be fun to drive fast and so obviously people do that, burning up fuel, crashing them, killing people, wasting materials, causing noise pollution, etc. Rich people buy up hundreds of cars that they never even drive. Young people go into massive debt to buy cars because they are status symbols which prevents them from spending in other parts of the economy and can set them up for financial problems that last their entire lives. Obviously cars provide massive utility to almost everyone, I‚Äôm not at all saying they shouldn‚Äôt exist.

            "text": "\"Liberal vs Conservative.\"\n\nMost Conservatives are quite liberal, and up until fairly recently, the GOP was pretty liberal. What they weren't was *progressive*, a term that is coming back into vogue, especially around President Biden.\n\nLiberal just means that liberty is in the hands of the people. That our liberties are our own and the government just runs shit. That's not opposite to Conservative. Conservatives' liberties they enjoy include gun and property ownership, and religious freedom. (I don't mean the right to oppress non-Christians, that's a whole other can of worms. I just mean what I said, the freedom to choose a religion and partake in it.)\n\nProgressives want to change things, often for the sake of, or sometimes illusion of progress. Conservatives think change, for the sake of change or the illusion of progress, is a waste of government resources. They just want things left alone and let the people do what the people are going to do. An example of this is North Carolina's somewhat recent bathroom bill. A Republican governor made it illegal for trans people to use the correct bathroom. A Conservative would say, \"just use the bathroom you're comfortable with, don't bother anyone, wash your hands, and be on your way.\" The Progressive would say, \"we need more inclusive bathrooms.\" Both are good, agreeable points. The \"bathroom police\" people are just assholes getting in the way of reasonable discussion.\n\nOh, the opposite of Liberal isn't Conservative... it's Authoritarian. Where the Liberal believes liberty is in the hands of the people, the Authoritarian believes liberty is a privilege doled out by the government.\n\nWhen it comes to US politics, calling the Democrats the party on the left and the Republicans the party on the right is somewhat disingenuous. Democrats are generally progressive, but they're also generally authoritarian. Republicans are generally conservative, but also a bit liberal. The \"Tea Party\" and \"Qanon\" \"Republicans\" are just fascists. They shouldn't be mistaken for Republicans for the most part, but at the same time, most Republicans are willing to side with them because they don't want to lose ground, politically, to the Democrats. However, things have reached a tipping point as the most extreme far-right and alt-right groups have in fact attempted to overthrow the government, and are now supporting pedophiles in Congress (something the Qanon group was originally against).\n\nThe point is, politics isn't just one side vs another. And even on the 2D chart of liberal vs authoritarian and progressive vs conservative, where exactly you fall will vary from issue to issue. So if you say \"gun rights,\" to the average person around here (North Carolina), you're getting liberal conservatives. Guns for everyone who wants them, no changes to gun laws. But if you say \"gay rights,\" you start seeing a lot of the same people swaying to the authoritarian direction. They believe it's the state's right to regulate that (never mind the 2nd Amendement they cherish calls for a *well regulated* militia), as long as the Church has its fingers deep in the government. Go to the Pacific Northwest and you get the opposite. (Does anyone really support authoritarian beliefs? Only when it's someone else. Everyone is liberal unto themselves, they believe they should have all the liberties. It's when it comes to their neighbors that they begin to have reservations, or conditions (often skin tone).)",

It is just about one of the most medically egregious things that is still widespread for various reasons, but definitely in part due to people simply not understanding the phrase: \"If it ain't broke, don't fuckin' fix it.\".  \n\nHow can you tell if you're a Circumcised male?  Look down at your penis.  If your skin changes color from skin-color to red/pink/maybe purple near the tip, you've been circumcised.  If you're an American who's watched any porn at all, the odds are very likely that you've seen a circumcised penis at some point.   \n\nI could say many, many more things about how it's a blatant disregard and affront to human health, ethics, and life, but I don't have the heart to right now, unfortunately.\n\nYou, yes, you, reader, can help stop circumcision from being a phenomenon affecting future generations by donating to the Circumcision Resource Center (poor name choice, I know) since they are currently holding a lawsuit against the usage of medicare/medicaid (I can't remember which) to fund circumcision procedures since using public money to fund circumcision is medical fraud and violates federal law.  Or, feel free to contact another organization devoted to halting this obviously malevolent practice.  \n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go re-expand the remaining skin and mucosa that I have on my Penis so that my Glans can eventually revert back to a more moisturized state, so that I can fap without fear of chafing and maybe enjoy masturbation again one day.",

For hundreds of years, island was spelled without an s, and it was originally a compound of two Old English words, ieg (the g is pronounced like a y) and land, where ieg was a word that meant a body of water. So an iegland or igland or iland (all were possible spellings) was a bit of land in a body of water. Well, several hundred years later, there are a ton of words that are entering English from Latin and French, and people who were clever enough to know a bit of those languages assumed, wrongly, that iland was somehow related to the French word ile, which had historically been isle from Latin insula. Wanting to acknowledge this influence, people began sticking an s that didn't belong into iland to make it island, and after several centuries, this became the standard practice. This happened with other words on firmer etymological principles. For instance, when the word debt was borrowed from French, it was spelled det or dette, and the b was added in later to highlight its etymological debt to the Latin debitum that was the origin of the French word.\n\nSo there is absolutely no good reason to have an s in island. At no point in the words history was an s regularly pronounced by any speaker of English, and it should never have been added in.

They were stretched so thin at that point, that if Denmark joined the war they could easily have marched on Berlin within a week.\n\n - shotguns were not these insane high-power unstoppable murder machines. Actually, since paper shells were the standard at the time, shotguns were unreliable at best unless kept exceptionally dry. Germany went after shotguns, not because of how effective they were, but because Germany wanted to deflect blame from their own crimes (remember: Germany was the one who started the whole poison gas thing, as well as shotguns and bombing raids and everything they did to Belgium, so their image wasn't the best in the international scope).\n\n - The assassination of Franz Ferdinand, while a big deal in hindsight, was not seen as such by most of Europe- nor the world- at the time. At that time, political figures being killed was merely seen as a risk of the job, and everyone mostly ignored it past the initial shock. It was the Austrian military staff who wanted to use it as an excuse the invade Serbia, but they had wanted to invade Serbia and the Balkans anyway. This gave them an excuse, but one which no one took seriously until it was far too late.\n\n - Very little about the war was inevitable, and it certainly wasn't foreseeable by any but the most cynical-minded war hawks. Yes, something would have happened with the Balkans eventually, but it did not have to spiral into the disaster that it did. Think of this: The Balkans had gone to war in 1911, 1913, and (leaping forward a good bit) in 1991. Not one of those events led the world into such a devastating war path.\n\n I could go on, but I must end this comment somewhere, and here seems as good a place as any.",

Business must run ASAP, or else the competition will crush you to death. We're trapped in a system that protects corruption.

Hell when it came to voter fraud you could even find a single republican source. Which whether voter fraud happened or not, the fact you can‚Äôt get both sides of the story is kind of sad.\n\nBut most people have just accepted this because they usually tell the audience that their side is right, even though most people don‚Äôt lean towards the far left or far right. \n\nI‚Äôve noticed republicans are most mad about this because most media are far left nowadays, and we get censored a lot. Hell I‚Äôve had this account banned and it took a month to get it unbanned after a guy was saying some horrible shit about me, my family, and other things, but I throw one insult back and I got banned. I‚Äôve been temporarily banned for the same reason. When there were videos of people throwing away ballots we were told we can‚Äôt post them because it didn‚Äôt happen. And a bunch of other just censorship happens. \n\nThe worst censorship was this one app that was 100% free speech. It was similar to Twitter but they said you have free speech their, no matter what political side your on. Now because republicans don‚Äôt have a place to go they went their and it got labeled as a republican app, even though it wasn‚Äôt. So what did Google, Apple, and Amazon do. Well they went to the app creators and said ‚ÄúHey you have 48 hours to delete all the hate speech otherwise well take you off our play stores and Amazon will delete your servers that your paying them for.‚Äù Now they really meant republican speech, but the creators said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs impossible to do in 48 hours and you know that‚Äù google, apple, and Amazon didn‚Äôt care, and 48 hours later, they shut down the app and the servers, and completely crashed this small company who made this app, all because republicans could speak on their. Now people say ‚Äúno it‚Äôs because their was hate speech‚Äù even though their wasnt, they already removed stuff like slurs, and supremacy posting, and left it free speech other then those hateful things. \n\nAnyway I went on a rant, I didn‚Äôt mean to make it political but it very quickly became political. I have to look at so much shit and see how easy people are getting brainwashed to believe democrats are god and republicans are nazis.

Phrase meanings can and often do change over time, with each new meaning supplanting the ones that came before. That's fine, that's cool, that doesn't bother me. What bothers me about this phrase in particular though is that the people I see using it most often present themselves as practicing christians. This makes sense given the term's biblical origin. What doesn't make sense is why none of these people seem to recognize the original meaning of prodigal when the Parable of the Prodigal Son is meant to be an integral part of Jesus's teachings on redemption. \n\nIt speaks to a disinterest in the faith these people profess to practice when they never bother to learn the key terms for one of the more important lessons of their religion, and this irks me.

Most of the exercises magszines and influencers suggest to target lower abs actually rely on the illio-psoas (hip flexors) to act as the prime mover, withthe rectus abdominus acting as a synigizer muscle.

It's SO prevalent that the term for stupid and ignorant is now \"religious\". Why on EARTH do we actually accept people saying \"they did it for their religion\" when blowing people up for the promise of 72 virgins or hating LGBTQ people, or the poor, and why in the FUCK are televangelists allowed even to exist? When you want to \"convert\" people into your pseudo-religion why are you allowed to? There are SO MANY cults since we all appear to want to \"addict\" everyone into SOMETHING. \"Religion\" is about NOT BEING A HORRIBLE PERSON. That is LITERALLY all there is to it. Going on and on about \"The Book\" when you can barely read isn't a way to go through life, son.\n3. Worse, even ATHEISTS instead of being called \"the anti-ignorance league\" or something ACTUALLY USEFUL are so proud of themselves saying \"I don't believe there is a God!\" Well, good for you. THIS HELPS NO ONE and is just dishonest emotional reactionary-ness disguised as logic because someone in a CULT who claimed they were religious when they are just vomiting their ignorance in the name of Their Great Teacher \"treated you badly\" or \"said something crazy\". EVERYONE KNOWS there is no literal \"God\". They can't admit it due to fear of punishment and exclusion from #1. Instead of educating people you people get to be RIGHT. You should be SO PROUD. EDUCATE PEOPLE instead of blathering on about how you are \"against\" something so obviously untrue.\n4. *Harvesting people's ignorance like a crop should be illegal.* The earth is LITERALLY DYING to create and aggregate more wealth for people who are already rich beyond all reason by Divide and Rule and pitting all humanity against each other.",

I managed to get promoted to the office, where I got a new (though unofficial) title, a tiny raise (like, a one dollar raise), and the hope of learning more about the job. The lady who promoted me left before she could train me, and the remaining manager was more interested in preserving her own job and did a bare minimum to train me.\n\nManagement changed a handful of times in a short period. New manager couldn't stand me, because I didn't kiss his ass. So, even though I did everything they said they needed me to do, management took back my raise. When and if I was near overtime, they told me they would have to put those hours on the next check. They did that to a lot of people. \n\nI also found out the power of nepotism when I discovered that my managers' S.O. was on the payroll, getting paid 6 dollars more than me, per hour, and got 40 hours a week (though they were never in the office!!) for allegedly doing the same work (or less) than I was. Apparently he was allowed to *work from home*, where I was told I could not.\n\nMy hours were cut, my pay was cut, and I was all but completely black-balled, until one of the managers said they needed me to be a recruiter, and offered to pay me what was taken away, even though it was only for 2-3 days a week for a month. So I assembled a crew and ran a handful of successful job fairs, even if just to get the experience, as I'd never run such events before.\n\nI'm so glad to be free of that toxic environment, but I learned the importance of standing up for myself because of it. But I hear of too many horror stories of employers playing with people's money like that FAR too much.",

The last 20 years a lot of stuff has happened because of herd mentality. Because of the pressure some group is pushing. Governments seem to have forgotten that groups, herds, flocks, almost never have the right answer. Groups tend to come to wrong conclusions, based on too little evidence and research, while groups lack the availability to debate openly; to think for themselves, individually; and to listen to other arguments outside of the arguments of their group. Therefore, the solutions that come from this group-thinking are rarely the right solutions, if even solutions at all. Still though, many western governments are lead by herd mentality.

It took two days and multiple hours of testing to figure out what was wrong with me. At first they said I had anxiety, but when I took anxiety medication, it made my day-to-day functioning much worse and I got intense \"brain fog\" as I call it. \n\nAfter going through multiple medications and trying out different doses, I finally found myself taking Adderall XR (extended release). If I don't take my medication,  I am a mess and I shouldn't even try to leave my house. Adderall not only calms my ADHD, but it takes away whatever anxiety I do have. \n\nTo my point: people nowadays fake symptoms just to get their hands on Adderall and honestly,  I understand why. Our world is so full of high expectations that we want to meet. The issue is that we can't meet these expectations all the time due to not having enough energy, becoming tired, and needing to eat. So what is something that I could use that could help get me through my day? Coffee? Nope, doesn't keep me focused enough. Caffeine pills? Nope, still won't get me to the level I need to be. Now, Adderall.  Thats the ticket. All day energy plus extreme focus? I'll take it! We've just become so focused on wanting to please others and meet their expectations that we are willing to fake symptoms of ADHD to get our hands on it. Or we will find someone who sells it. \n\nSo, do I tell people that I have ADHD? No.. I mean I told you guys here on reddit, but in person? Absolutely not. I don't even say anything about taking Adderall because I will get a \"so, do you really have ADHD or what doctor did you see that was willing to prescribe you Adderall?\" Or someone will ask me to sell them some. \n\nPeople know that taking Adderall when not having ADHD is wrong, but it has become so normal to take it that it can actually shame those who actually have ADHD.

It‚Äôs become clear to me over the past few decades that the trend of deregulation makes life shittier for everyone except the super wealthy. This should be expected since the market and capitalism don‚Äôt give a fuck about your life. \n\nWhat happened to people caring about each other? Helping each other and acting as a community? I see millions of people saying that they belong to a religion, but not doing any of the things their religion says that they should do. The hypocrisy is enough to drive a person mad.

It was seen as going overtly against those religion's concepts of charity and helping the poor. In a specific Christian context, usury was often argued against because of how Jesus gave so willingly to the poor; if THE figure of your religion was so open, selfless, and charitable, then it flies in the face of his teachings to charge interest or profit off of someone needing a loan. \n\nWe have not only built a lot of modern society around interest and loans, BUT we also changed the definition of usury. The modern definition isn't interest but rather \"excessive interest in a moral sense\". Someone need to charge too much interest, and general society has to look at that and say it is morally wrong to charge that amount of interest before we can even apply the term to anything. \n\nWhen you rewrite the definition of a word so that you can overcomes millenniums of precedent and do the exact thing that your religion condemns, that feels like something that is so widespread it isn't considered wrong anymore.",

It blows my mind that it doesn't carry a stigma.  \n\nReal kids wear those things, though the uniforms I've seen in recent years blessedly have non skirt options/seem to be making an effort to not look like the trope/etc.  But yeah, I had a friend as a teen in a school with a pleated skirt uniform for girls, and she got no end of commentary walking home from school. :|  It's unusual enough in my area that she was really singled out, like as a 14 year old.  \n\nI remember telling her I was jealous because my mom wouldn't let me wear things like that, and her response was just that it wasn't fun when they make you, and she hated it.",

The manager \"so glad you applied, we are so desperate for housekeepers, we can't seem to keep any and most won't show up on the first day\". I explained that I had plenty of housekeeping experience and I needed a job desperately cause my last job(delivery driver) fired all their delivery drivers and switched to door dash. She seemed super excited to hire me since we were both so desperate and at the end of the hiring \"oh by the way, we have a 90 day probation period\" which I immediately knew was not a company I wanted to work for, so I decided to take the job while still job searching elsewhere. The other 2 housekeepers were telling me how everyone they have been hiring, have been getting fired after their first few days to few weeks. They were so overworked. And sure enough, I was 2 weeks in, and I got a really bad stomach bug, so bad I couldn't get out of bed and was puking in buckets every 20 minutes or so. I called in to explain the situation, I was literally puking while on the phone telling the boss I was so sorry. Next day I still wasn't feeling well but the puking stopped so I went into work, as soon as I walked in, my boss told me I was fired. I laughed and said \"that's alright, I start a new job in 2 days that actually understands that we are all only human and doesn't put their other employees through hell waiting to hire the perfect person, which doesn't exist.\" And walked out. That was the second job I've had that had that 90 day probation period, will never work for another company that has that rule.",

In other words they screw you on interest, put you at huge liability, then take zero liability themselves. Poor people with high risk of default get it the worst... they pay the most interest on the longest loans for the least amount of benefit. \n\nAnother big one is the credit agencies. You do not have a credit rating, you have a debt rating. If you are a multi-millionaire with zero debt, you cannot get a loan for anything. You need to borrow money to get a higher \"credit\" rating, and again... poor people get it the worst. You can have a great credit rating, with tens of thousands of dollars of debt you cannot afford to pay, and the credit agencies would love to extend your credit further at exorbitantly high interest ratings so you are perpetually in debt and cannot pay it.

            "text": "Kinda old school, but it's the concept of respect. When I was much younger, it was socially unacceptable to speak disrespectfully towards someone who is older than you. That's all fine and dandy, however, there was no rule against older people being disrespectful towards younger people. A prime example is my stepdad's parents. Whenever I was in 7th grade, my mom and stepdad both worked on tuesdays, so they would send my \"grandmother\" over to watch my little sister. Technically speaking, I was 12 and my brother was 13, so we would've been just fine. Everything was okay until my step grandma started blatantly disrespecting us in our own house. She would call us names and threaten us daily. My sister helped her. Despite being six years old, she would tell her grandmother we hit her. As a result, we would get hit. At first, I just dealt with it. After the second or third time, I began to fight back. With the help of my brother, we were able to stand up for ourselves. I had no filter, so I said a lot not very nice words to her and her husband whenever they made me mad. That crazy old b\\*tch even looked up a definition of a word I used to insult her, because she claimed I didn't know what it meant. Afterwards, the abuse became more psychical. They would corner me and start punching me. I would always kick her off of me, but there were sometimes when she would grab my legs. If it weren't for my brother who always jumped in to defend me, I probably could've gotten hurt. She would also play the victim and tell my stepdad that we pushed/punched/kicked her. This caused my stepdad to get up in our faces and threaten us, whilst lecturing us about respecting our elders. He thought because his dad is a vietnam veteran and his mother is a breast cancer survivor, means we automatically have to respect them. I told my mom many times about their insubordination, she never believed me until she saw the bruises on my arms. My mom fought with my stepdad over it. My mom quit her job so we no longer had to deal those crazy ass old people. Since then, I've gotten no christmas/birthday presents from them. They still tell my little sister I'm an ungrateful brat. Won't be surprised if they end up in a nursing home. lmao",

No!!! The govt is there for a reason and the people do not need to pamper the leaders by not expecting much from them.

Then generally continue to have a lovely conversation with the staff as to which of their newer products gives them the best orgasm. \nI'm open about this stuff, doesn't phase me in the slightest. \n\n I realised it was happening 5-6 years ago and like to wind the staff up while i have the upper hand. \nHad 2 visits totalling around ¬£600 for free in one shop because the assistant was rude to me when I mentioned it....then made a scene and made sure every one of the 50 odds women there had to hear me saying ...\n\n(Deep breath). \n\" Ehm excuse me but what the actual fuck!???\nI'm in here paying a hundred quid for a bit of string and you're telling me the chances are, some sweaty fat bastard has already had it on while he wanked himself off In your changing rooms!!\" \n\nKeep that up for 30 seconds and regardless of how much gear you've got in your hands, it's free.

Also this isn't a gender thing, why tf is a teacher looking there, baring in mind since (like previously said) no-one was wearing anything like a mini skirt, they'd have to look at least somewhat close to notice a difference, even though they make it sound like they noticed by a small glance?

            "text": "Letting domestic cats free roam outside. I'm NOT saying cats should be kept indoors all the time, there are ways to let cats have outdoor space. Keep reading. If anyone replies trying to accuse me of saying that I think cats should be locked up inside, I'm not going to reply.\n\nI know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this. This proves my point. Please hear me out.\n\nCats were domesticated as pest control. This is all well and good in the past, when there were a lot less people (and cats) and a lot more mice. Cats have always been independent, successful hunters, which makes them great companions on a farm, where your crops and animal food is at constant attack from mice.\n\nWe don't live in that world anymore. There are more humans, and not many of us have huge stacks of wheat, corn and animal food that needs protecting. But (in the UK at least) it's still normal to keep cats outside, free to do as they please.\n\nThe result - legally protected songbirds, amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals dying in their millions. In the UK, there are around 6 million outdoor cats. According to a survey by the Mammal Society, more than 100 million animals are killed by domestic cats every Spring. 55 million of which are songbirds. And that's just based on the numbers reported. In actuality, the number could be 3, 4 times higher. Probably more.\n\nTo give a scale of the problem, out of the 5 most commonly killed birds (songthrushes, blackbirds, starlings, house sparrows, and bluetits), 3 are in a steep national decline. Our frogs and newts are all in decline, because their natural defence of playing dead doesn't work for cats. (You can build as many wildlife ponds as you want, it doesn't mean squat if you or any of your neighbors has a cat). Cats can't tell a house mouse apart from a yellow necked mouse, a harvest mouse, or god-forbid, a water vole or a dormouse (critically endangered, almost extinct, in the UK). \n\nEven more mind-numbing, our only wild cat left- the Scottish Wildcat, is being bred into extinction because the only mates they can now find are domestic cats. Apart from captive populations, pure bred Wildcats are due to disappear from the wild pretty soon. \n\nHere we are, digging in our pockets to donate to save the tiger and the snow leopard, when our actions are causing the extinction of the only wild feline on our home soil.\n\nOne last kicker for the people in the back, who say it's 'natural' for cats to kill prey - no. It's not. \n\nIt's natural for a stoat, a fox, an owl, a weasel, a sparrow hawk, or any of our few remaining wild predators to kill prey animals. But for all intents and purposes, domestic cats are invasive animals that take and don't give back to nature. Every animal a cat kills (which inevitably gets thrown in the bin like rubbish), a wild predator misses out on a meal. A wild animal that doesn't have a human to put food out for them. A wild animal that relies on hunting to feed its young, goes hungry. Every spring, when a predator is struggling to feed their young, 55 million prey animals are being killed on mass by domestic cats and tossed in the trash. What a waste of life, eh?\n\nAnd we wonder why we dont see as many owls or sparrow hawks any more, and why urban foxes now resort to bin scavenging.\n\nSo much of our natural land is being built on, and gardens are some of the few remnants of green space we allow. And yet as we put out bird food, build wild life ponds, and plant wildflowers, we set loose apex predators that we created to have an insatiable blood lust, even when they are not hungry. Cats are like humans this way. \n\nThe sickest thing about this, is that wildlife charities in the UK (especially the RSPB) skirt around the issue, because a vast majority of their donators are cat owners, and they don't want to risk losing funding. Instead talk to any wildlife hospital or centre. Essex wildlife hospital alone has said more than 60% of animals brought in are cat victims. Most can't be saved, because cat saliva is rich in bacteria, and their teeth are like needles. Wounds fester almost immediately, and can't be stitched up.\n\nI am absolutely NOT saying cats should be indoor pets, but they should be contained and controlled whenever they are allowed outside. Cat proof fencing exists, catios can be built, and cats CAN be taught to wear harnesses. \n\nYes, people tend to get cats because they want a more independent, and less needy pet than a dog, which means they tend to be unwilling to put in the work to train a cat, or fit cat proof fencing. But if you want a cat, you should put in the effort to own one responsibly.\n\nAnd before anyone attacks me in the comments saying you 'Can't contain a cat' or 'Cats can't be trained', I'm going to address that straight away. Please don't waste your breathe, I won't reply.\n\nCats can be trained. Go on YouTube. I've trained a mouse to play basket ball. Its common practice now for bird owners to harness train their parrots. In comparison, cats are easy. My friend has taught her cat to talk on command and high five. Cats can be trained to use a human toilet for god's sake. Don't be lazy, stop making excuses, cats can be trained to wear a harness. \n\nOur wildlife was here first. Our pets are extensions of ourselves. What do you think it says about you as a person, if you're comfortable letting a pet kill wildlife? \n\nThink long and hard before replying.",
