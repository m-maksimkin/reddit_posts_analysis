The siccari believed a messiah would save them from Roman oppression and subsequently rule the world under ‚ú° law. The new testament is a satirical riddle filled retelling of Titus flavius' campaign to exterminate this group of rebels. Their motivation was to reduce cost associated with putting down these constant messianic rebellions and replace this radical religion with one that was based in Rome, was passive, respected Roman law and rendered unto Caesar what is Caesars. Titus flavius was the first to ask his men to not be afraid, to follow him at the sea of galilee and to become fishers of men. Titus flavius fulfilled Jesus prophecy about the son of man leading an army to destroy the temple and subsequently the wicked generation in their lifetime at the siege of Masada. If you compare all of the gospels written long after Jesus supposed death with flavius josephus war of the Jews the riddle can be solved. Roman law required those in the empire to worship Caesar as God. The hidden messiah of Christianity is the Roman emperor and his son. This operation satisfied the  requirements of Roman states to be passive, worship Caesar and pay their taxes. This theory is gone into in depth in the book Caesars messiah. You might want to actually read the book before attacking the theory. It's extremely compelling and makes the most sense from a historical context.",

Even recognizing the fact that only 50 miles above their head is void, forever. Only planets and stars. People don't perceive Earth rotating during sunsets, they see the sun moving even though it relatively isn't. I hate that ignorance, that's why scientists do what they do. They have a eureka moment of absolute emotional devastation as their perception of reality is destroyed and shoots far past their immediate surroundings (unlike the uneducated majority who have been fed lies like \"ignorance is bliss\" and other things.) The fact that nobody looks up at the night sky as thousands of stars with thousands of planets and truly perceive it as a HUGE and vast 3D environment.

A large part of it is just the huge adrenaline rush, but there's a lot more to it. There's not a ton of medical accounts on it that I can see after a cursory google, but I can attest that it is the truth and I'm sure there are plenty of others who will back me up.\n\nHere's the unsettling part\n\nSometimes in combat you don't just get an erection. Sometimes, only sometimes, you ejaculate.\n\nThe first time I was ever in a position where I might see combat, a tech told me and some other younger guys \"Just keep your head on straight, deep breaths. Also, you might jizz your pants.\" \n\nSo imagine being this one kid who was riding with me. Kid was a Mormon, joined the army as a show of defiance to his parents and left the church (they're supposed to be concientious objectors). Kid had never been touched and by his account had never even touched himself, yet now he's sitting here, maybe about to get shot at for the first time, and he's told it could be the first orgasm of his life.\n\nSo next time you watch a war movie, just remember that, historically and biologically speaking, 99% of the male soldiers you see have erections and of those probably like 5 - 10% just shot a huge load into their waistband.\n\nEnjoy the history channel now lol",

A freedom of information request  bought it to light after the 30 years had passed. You may still be able to find this online somewhere But I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs been covered up again. The USA government also own patents on cannabinoids as anti cancerous compounds and also as neuro-protective agents too. \n\nThe results of the research actually showed that cannabis/thc can potentially shrink tumours by up to 50% in that specific study in 1979. More research has been done since which backs this up but yet we are still decades away from a ‚Äúofficially recognised‚Äù cure/treatment none of which use natural cannabinoids at all which are proven  to be safe and effective but only natural cannabinoids work, the synthetic versions big pharma tried to recreate and patent do not work anywhere near as well if at all for some still unknown reason. The cancer industry is also worth nearly a trillion dollars altogether. All that could be wiped out potentially by a single plant anyone can grow in their backyard or basement etc. \n\nCall if a conspiracy theory if you want. It doesn‚Äôt change the facts.

Seized that medication and give them another treatment (better diet, teas and vitamins) naturally the patients got better amd stopped coming. Some new patients actually came looking for my dad because he cured most of the patients he was seeing.\n\nIn another instance, he requested a patient to get a different tests (for tropical diseases) and the Doctor who was in charge of the clinic told him to stop requesting for those tests cuz it makes the county look bad \"cuz you're diagnosing third world country diseases and it reflects bad on us\"\n\nThe drop that spilled the cup was that time in which the doctor approached and told him to \"stop changing their medication because then they get better an then they dont comeback\"(which i mean its the entire point of the healt system)\n\nHe remained there for a couple weeks as soon as he became citizen, he left that place and got us residency.",

While we have better graduation rates than we used to and many students go on to college and successful careers, we have a group that can't seem to make it and get taken advantage of by businesses and predatory individuals (criminals).\n\nI met a homeless recovering meth addict yesterday who has had his car towed by the apartment complex he is staying at.  He is not on the lease, neither is the relative he is staying with. He is clueless about what to do.  I advised him to contact a lawyer and gave him the name of the Tarrant County Bar Association.  They will give you names of attorneys you can consult very briefly at no cost.\n\nI don't think he is unusual in his inability to engage the system to get redress for harm done by businesses or powerful individuals.  I told my son that poor people get treated like shit.  (While that is especially true in Texas, it is probably also true in other parts of the U.S., to a lesser or greater degree depending on the community's culture.  Being in the Bible Belt doesn't seem to mitigate the mistreatment, as all the former slave holders were Christians in name if not in practice.)\n\n I, however, went to college and soon fell in with a charismatic friend who was an anti nuclear activist. We wound up engaging the legal system by being taken into custody for breaking the law. The upshot is that I learned how to stand up for not only my rights, but the rights of others.\n\nWhile it isn't always necessary to break the law to get justice, the public schools aren't teaching their students how to engage the government and the legal system to get justice, or in the case of the young man I mentioned, to recover his property.",

Some places ban preventive use. Some places' laws require that you humanely kill anything trapped quickly. The CDC advises against using them at all because of the disease-spreading danger.

We believe what we see and then we believe our interpretation of it, we don't even know we are making an interpretation most of the time. We think this is reality.\" \n\n Robert Anton Wilson\n\n>The idea does not necessarily imply that there is no objective truth; rather that our access to it is mediated through our senses, experience, conditioning, prior beliefs, and other non-objective factors. The implied individual world each person occupies is said to be their reality tunnel. The term can also apply to groups of people united by beliefs: we can speak of the fundamentalist Christian reality tunnel or the ontological naturalist reality tunnel.\n\n>A parallel can be seen in the psychological concept of confirmation bias‚Äîthe human tendency to notice and assign significance to observations that confirm existing beliefs, while filtering out or rationalizing away observations that do not fit with prior beliefs and expectations. This helps to explain why reality tunnels are usually transparent to their inhabitants. While it seems most people take their beliefs to correspond to the \"one true objective reality\", Robert Anton Wilson emphasizes that each person's reality tunnel is their own artistic creation, whether they realize it or not. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_tunnel",

Keep in mind this industry is quite close to a town and the public anyway they came up with this crazy idea to send a nuclear charge a certain depth underground to create and big bore hole in which they could pump waste into, toxic flammable corrosive waste .. this just seems crazy to me if there is still big amounts of waste down there and it some how ignites it will cause chaos, gas clouds, massive explosions, chemical fires.

In fact he is known to have taken more radiation poisoning then anyone else in history. Because of this radiation it messed up his chromosomes aswell as his cells and mine system \n\n\nHe was kept alive for 83 days by scientists and doctors \n\n\nDuring that time by day 20 almost all the skin on his body had fallen off leaving his entire body in constant pain. \n\nLater the skin around his eyes as well as his eyelids also came off so his eyes were always open even when asleep. His eyes would also something leak blood making it looks tho he was crying.\n\n\nHis intestines were so messed up that he started to have constant dihereaa which soon started to have large amounts of blood because his intestines were starting to decay from the inside. \n\n\nOn day 53 his heart stopped 3 times but scientists and doctors were able to restart it. He was basically only being kept alive by machines at this point and the doctors started questioning if it would be more humane to let the man die as he was in very obvious unimaginable indescribable levels of pain and suffering. Some doctors even said that it was torture forcing him to live like this\n\n\n\nDue to the radiation almost all the muscles in his body had been destroyed the only one that wasn't was his heart which was still being keep alive from the various machines.\n\n\n\nThe worst part of all of this is that ouchie was completely concious throughout all of it and while he couldn't talk due to tubes being in his throat to help him breathe as the radiation also destroyed his lungs he was in obvious pain everytime someone touched him or even while he was just laying on his bed. \n\n\nAnd while around the 2 month mark it's unknown of he even felt pain as he stopped reacting to being touched as well as stopped thriving in agony 24/7 his pupils still shrank when light was shown into them suggesting brain activity (hopefully he did stop feeling pain by then if not then that makes it even worse) \n\n\n\nHis body around day 80 was quite obviously to anyone at this point unsalvageable and mold was starting to develop on his skinless body. He was even described as \"a corpse with a beating heart\" so they decided that trying to save him wasn't worth it and pulled his plug when they did they studied his body and found out that his organs had all started to decay when he was still alive. \n\n\n\nAll of this and more happened to one man who should've been killed out of mercy for his sake. Hisashi ouchie has probably had the most painful torturous slowly agony death of all time.\"    \nEdit : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mxqjly/whats_a_piece_of_information_you_wish_you_never/gvsebwj?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3",

It's been this way since before the new century. The precincts get to keep the assets seized (unless the original owners wend their way through the court system _and win_). The police use this stuff to not only buy party stuff but off-the-record surveillance gear.\n\nI tend to say Law Enforcment kills about four people a day. Only since the Ferguson Unrest in 2014 did it become public attention that the police murder a lot of people. In fact, the FBI is required to track _all_ police involved killings and report them to the BJS thanks to a congressional order from the 1980s. They just don't. Small private organizations track police involved killings from coroner reports, news reports and obituaries, but many of them are not reported by the officer who killed them (or any of their colleagues). Even now that news agencies are tracking police-involved killing, not all of them are tracked and found, especially if a victim is homeless or doesn't have known surviving family. About 1200 a year are tracked ones reports are exchanged and cross-matched. We only can estimate how many are lost between 600 and 1200, meaning that four a day (1461 a year) is actually generous.\n\nOver half the homicides in the United States are not reported with a cause. This aren't TV murders where someone finds a body and a long investigation leads to a serial murderer (serial killers are super rare). Of _reported_ homicides, two neighbors have a dispute, one has a handgun and shoots the other guy in a drunken fit of rage. (Drinking and guns _notoriously_ don't mix much like drinking and driving, or operating any other dangerous machinery.) If law enforcement better tracked who died and why, we might actually be able to better eliminate circumstances in which people might shoot each other. But they don't, and we have to guess due to a tinier sample.\n\nIn fact, if we count _only_ homicides with a reported cause and motive, police-involved killings are really high ranking (domestic incidents and gang-related incidents are rather tiny numbering less than 200, typically). Again, the police can change this by actually completing reports.",

See, where she lives, abortions are illegal, and her situation was apparently, catalogued as an abortion. She was thrown to prison, 16 years, for \"involuntary manslaughter\" that was 2016, and even after many protest and media coverage, the state refuses to drop the charges, and the department store hasn't taken any responsibility about their acts\n\nEDIT: So in good news, she was freed in 2019, as noted by an user after me\n\nEDIT 2: BTW, as people ask, her name is Dafne Mcpherson, the store is a Mexican chain named Liverpool, located in San Juan del R√≠o, Quer√©taro. The reason I didn't knew she was (thankfully) freed is my fault, the story was lost in between lots of stories that happened from then to today.

Neither of which was palatable, so good Ol' Bobby Mac came up with a genius idea - let's round up all the morons!\n\nThey literally took mentally ill people, people of below average intelligence, unable to read/write and others who would have previously been classified as \"unfit to serve\" and selectively pushed them through the draft. There were about ~400,000 of these men who were sent to Vietnam as part of one of the branches.\n\nThis was also McNamara's pet experiment to see if he could make these men \"better\" with training. These men's papers were stamped as being part of the program, so the commanders on the ground knew that they were different than normal soldiers. So naturally, the \"idiots\" were used as cannon fodder. Usually the first ones in to dangerous unknown situations, by design intended to be the hardest hit so as to not waste the lives of the \"normal soldiers\".\n\nThese soldiers died at rates far higher than others for these reasons.

Dura mater is a layer of the meninges of the brain, and if you suffer traumatic brain injuries a dura mater graft is needed. Nowadays, a synthetic is available, in the 70s this was not the case. Instead the dura mater needed to be harvested from corpses who would willingly donate to Lyodura. However, to produce more dura mater, they began paying doctors to remove dura mater without consent, and because it was harvested illegally, this meant there was no record of the individuals it was collected from. Lyodura sterilised all dura mater together, and this lead to the perfect storm. All it took was one individual to die of Creuzfeldt Jakob disease and to have their dura mater harvested, before being collected and mass sterilised. Because Prions are quite indestructible, it is believed that nearly all Lyodura‚Äôs dura mater became contaminated with the disease. It is unknown how many individuals developed Creuzfeldt Jakob disease because of this, but the number was certainly high.",

            "text": "There was a medical manufacturing lab in the UK that kept having reports of headaches and weird visions. People would see something at the edge of their vision, but couldn't figure out what it was. It wasn't just one person either, and was causing some serious panic. When they entered a room, they felt a \"presence,\" like someone else was in the room with them, and something would appear at the corner of their eye, then disappear when they tried to look. \n\nTurns out, it was caused by a newly installed fan that was vibrating, causing a sound that was too low-frequency for humans to hear it. Hilariously, the guy who discovered it found it using a fencing sword. He had brought it to work and put it in a vice to polish it, but then the sword started vibrating. Me, I would have nope'd out of there, considering the room was haunted, and now a sword is moving, but he was apparently much braver. \n\nThe frequency is known as the \"fear\" or \"ghost\" frequency. It's around 19hz. [Here](https://youtu.be/h-zM3qAzBaw) is a YouTube video of 18.98hz. Mileage may vary, for some people it causes just mild discomfort, others it causes total panic, and still others it does nothing. For me, it caused my eyes to feel weird, and after a good minute or so, I noticed weirdness at the edge of my vision, and was definitely creeped out. I shut it off then, definitely an unnerving experience. \n\nIt's not entirely known why it triggers such a response. The optical illusions and eye discomfort are likely due to the frequency resonating with your eyeballs, causing them to vibrate. But the actual fear response is unknown. Some theories are that our bodies are able to detect low frequencies, such as that of earthquakes or predator roars, but we just can't hear it. A bit like how deaf people can still \"feel\" certain sounds. So we become alert and nervous around these \"infrasounds,\" since they usually indicated danger. This, combined with the optical illusions, leads to some pretty uncomfortable experiences. \n\nOh, and don't worry, \"vibrate your eyeballs\" sounds way worse than it is. It's like super tiny vibrations, and your eyeballs are nice and squishy. It's not harmful in the slightest. At least, not mentally. Certainly feels like you are doing some eldritch ritual though.\n\n(Edited due to me being a doorknob and mixing up Hz with kHz)",

            "text": "There's such a thing as parasitic castration. That's a parasite that makes the host unable to reproduce. That alone is unsettling, but what specifically makes me shiver with disgust is that it basically can turn its host into a zombie intent on the reproduction of the parasite. Not sure if all examples do this, but it is likely. The one that I know of is Sacculina carcini, a parasite from the family of barnacles that specifically targets crabs. \n\nThe process is basically that the female Sacculina larvae infects preferrably female crabs. It grows inside the crab, and basically takes over, forming an external egg sac where the crabs would keep their eggs too. The crab can also no longer molt. A male larva looks for the egg sac to fertilise the Sacculina eggs. Later on, the crab host will care for these eggs as if it was their own offspring. I am not sure if an infected female is also castrated by the parasite, it seems to be mentioned nowhere, though I read that upon removal the crabs can develop new ovarian tissue. \n\nSo what happens if a male crab is infected? Well, the parasite tries to switch the male to female. This includes flattening the  abdomen to resemble that of a female, and releasing female hormones. The male crabs have also been known to female mating dances. This works so well that apparently male crabs usually develop complete or partial ovaries instead of testes after removal of the parasite. \n \n\nLuckily, there does not seem to be a species of castrating parasite that affects any more complex organisms. The arguably most complex organism would be fish. There's also one that affects I believe avacia trees. Apart from that it is generally insects, arthropods, worms, and crustaceans.",

Overtime, something that disturbed me was my natural calmness with the needles when I took them everywhere, especially as a 10 year old boy who hated getting the flu shot every year.\n\nAlso around this time, I was part of a touring boys chorus, and when they saw me carrying this small bag with me everywhere they were confused (the bag held all my Insulin with Ice packs to keep it safe for long travel). One of them after about 3 weeks of looking asked me about it and I told him it was my insulin case holding a bunch of needles.\n\nHis face was very concerned because the boys ranged from 9-14 in the group and he was younger side. Hearing the word 'needle' was like hearing 'dentist.' As more kids learned about me, they always saw that case with a strange look. I'm not sure if it was because carrying a bag of sharp objects and mentally scaring them (to kids mostly) or if I was just weird. Talked with other teens who grew up type 1 and had similar looks.\n\nSummary: I think an unknown unsettling thing is how much we can easily disassociate things we usually see as dangerous and raise a kid to not think twice about it.

I've worked with small children my whole life and fortunately we have had huge strides in combating SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). SIDS is basically death of under 2 year olds from seemingly common sense things, like suffocating on a blanket, hanging by the neck from a blind cord or climbing out the apartment window. Most things can be prevented with cheap safety equipment and not putting toys or bottles in a cot without constant supervision. But there's always stuff that we can never protect against.\n\nA baby I once knew was in her bassinet next to her father while he worked from home. She fell asleep for what he expected to be an hour nap. An hour twenty passed and he checked her but she was cold. She had vomited which is normal for a baby, then breathed it in, drowning. In arm's reach of her father.\n\nThis one isn't SIDS, but it happened last year so it's fresh. This child was 2 when he went to swimming lessons at the public pool. The next morning he wasn't feeling well and his parents took him to the GP. The GP sent them to the hospital for tests. He drastically deteriorated while the doctors realised it was meningitis, and finally passed away. His parents are young and he was their first and only, so they have been beyond devestated. His name was Noah and he was the best kid I've ever met and I don't think I'll ever not cry thinking about him.",

Buildings beforehand were just composed out of systems found by experimenting around and noting when something collapsed. This fact thus means that at least one of the following is true: We have some oversights in structural engineering (not good bcs we're building huge skyscrapers and chances are you are in a building right now); Those buildings might collapse at any given time (a bit better but a lot of people are in cathedrals and mosques at daytime); 150 years or so of engineers all collectively were unable to explain something that should work within structural engineering (bad, compare point 1).",

State of the art chips are only a few orders of magnitude from reaching that limit, which by the way also holds true for quantum computing. Once that limit is reached or approached asymptotically, all further increases in global computing power will result in greater power consumption. Given that a large number of problems in machine learning require on the order of billions of times the currently available computational power to solve within a given rate of error, the implications are that a whole range of AI/automation related fields will begin to stagnate over the next 20-30 years. Unless fusion power miraculously becomes feasible and cost effective in an absurdly optimistic time frame there is just no physical way to make AI or even things like 100% safe self-driving vehicles a thing given limits on energy production capacity. We will never produce enough energy to run the computations necessary to get object classification scores up to near perfect accuracy, and that's the fundamental problem.",

This would likely lead to mass extinctions possibly the destruction of life on Earth. There is nothing we could do to stop this from happening, and because the bursts travel at the speed of light, by the time we knew about it, it would be too late. The chances of this happening are very low, as Gamma Ray Bursts only happen in the Milky Way about once every 5 million years, and it would have to come from relatively close by to have this kind of effect.

It killed tens of thousands and had impacted the lives of so many more by causing health problems and birth defects in those affected by the gas (Think of typical radiation poisoning health issues, it‚Äôs similar to that). \n\nIt‚Äôs as big of a disaster as Chernobyl if not worse yet it‚Äôs rarely mentioned or remembered. \n\n\nWorst part is it all could have been prevented by several safety systems in the plant that were all shut off or in disrepair including the isocyanide tank‚Äôs refrigeration system that would have prevented the thermal runaway event.

It was shut off to save $30/month in electricity costs! \n\nThe silver lining to all this is that it woke up the entire planet in terms of the importance of the level of safety necessary to build and operate industrial plants worldwide.

The symptoms start out very mild, not feeling well, headwche and fever..but gets progressively worse over a few days and once it gets worse your chance of survival starts to plummet as the bacteria is usually eating your brain and nervous system at this time.... So it starts as just a routine sickness so often people who died from it are miss diagnosed. Worst part of all now all the initial symptoms overlap with covid so if you get sick doctors who normally might miss it have been more reason to ignore the early symptoms. \n\nWhile it's low chance roughly 15-30 people die each year of the cases so far only 4 people have survived aka 97% mortality rate.\n\nIf the water is warm and stagnant DONT LET IT SHOOT UP YOUR NOSE!!!!",

I worked on a ride called Shockwave.  Every morning, we did a \"track walk\" where we walked around in the long grass under the ride looking for bolts that had broken off of the ride the day before.  These were foot long, one inch diameter bolts that would sheer off from the stress.  \n\nOn one hot summer day, I came back after my day off to see that we were only running one train when it should have been three because of the size of the crowd.  The line was ridiculously long as a result, like over three hours.  Turns out, the day before, just as the train crested the top of the lift, a large man's lap bar had broken off in his hand.  This was a stand up roller coaster where you straddled a bicycle seat thing.  There was one permanently mounted loop for your left hand to hold onto, but the right loop was hinged and had a bar that went across your belly.  Well that hinged part broke off.  He was without a lap bar 110 feet in the air.  He went through the entire ride, with several loops, without a lap bar.  At the end of the ride, he stepped out of the train onto a catwalk in the transfer track area, a place where the riders are still trapped in the train.  He walked up to the guy at the control panel and handed him the lap bar.  The next day when I got there, they were busy rewelding all of the lap bars.  That's why only one train was running.  He was a fit, 200lb man in his 20s.  Had he been really overweight, a kid, or someone elderly, he definitely would have gone out of the train.\n\nThere were many, many more horror stories, some involving deaths.\n\nTo this day, I have zero trust for amusement park rides.

That tragic event shows just how deadly an incompetent and corrupt regime can be. Just as an example, officials only reported good news and high production numbers such as with food. As a result the government believed there was a mass surplus a food so worked were moved away from the fields and into mines and steel production but guess what? There was actually a food shortage that only got even worse. The Chinese government also dedicated efforts to destroy certain species of animals such as Sparrows which only upset the ecological balance and led to reduced number of crops due to there being more insects eating crops which led to more Famine.

Mary Ellen was routinely beaten and\r  \nneglected. A religious missionary to the poor named Etta Wheeler learned of\r  \nthe child‚Äôs plight and determined to rescue her. Wheeler consulted the police,\r  \nbut they declined to investigate. Wheeler sought assistance from child-helping\r  \ncharities, but they lacked authority to intervene in the family. At that time,\r  \nof course, there was no such thing as CPS, and the juvenile court did not come\r  \ninto existence for another quarter century. Eventually, Wheelersought advice from\r  \nHenry Bergh, the influential founder of the American Society for the Prevention\r  \nof Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). Bergh asked his lawyer, Elbridge Gerry, to\r  \nfind a legal mechanism to rescue the child. Gerry drew up the necessary papers,\r  \nand a judge ordered Mary Ellen removed from her guardians.\r  \nFollowing the rescue of Mary Ellen, animal protection advocate Henry\r  \nBergh and attorney Elbridge Gerry lamented the fact that no government\r  \nagency or nongovernmental organization was responsible for child protection.

When the police and fire marshals got there, they found the cook, a seventy-year-old woman, chained to the stove by her ankle. She later said that she had set the fire as a suicide attempt because she feared being punished. She said that slaves taken to the uppermost room never came back. As reported in the New Orleans Bee of April 11, 1834, bystanders responding to the fire attempted to enter the slave quarters to ensure that everyone had been evacuated. Upon being refused the keys by the LaLauries, the bystanders broke down the doors to the slave quarters and found \"seven slaves, more or less horribly mutilated ...suspended by the neck, with their limbs apparently stretched and torn from one extremity to the other\", who claimed to have been imprisoned there for some months.

            "text": " In 1966, a botched circumcision left eight-month-old Reimer without a penis. Money persuaded the baby's parents that sex reassignment surgery would be in Reimer's best interest. At the age of 22 months, Reimer underwent an orchiectomy, in which his testicles were surgically removed. He was reassigned to be raised as female and his name changed from Bruce to Brenda. Money further recommended hormone treatment, to which the parents agreed. Money then recommended a surgical procedure to create an artificial vagina, which the parents refused. Money published a number of papers reporting the reassignment as successful.\n\nDuring subsequent appointments with Reimer and Reimer's twin brother Brian, Money forced the two to rehearse sexual acts, with David playing the bottom role as his brother \"[pressed] his crotch against\" David's buttocks. Money also forced the two children to strip for \"genital inspections\", occasionally taking photos. Money justified these criminal acts by claiming that \"childhood 'sexual rehearsal play'\" was important for a \"healthy adult gender identity\".\n\nFor several years, Money reported on Reimer's progress as the \"John/Joan case\", describing apparently successful female gender development and using this case to support the feasibility of sex reassignment and surgical reconstruction even in non-intersex cases. Notes by a former student at Money's laboratory state that, during the yearly follow-up visits, Reimer's parents routinely lied to staff about the success of the procedure. Reimer's twin brother, Brian, later developed schizophrenia. At 14 years old and in extreme psychological agony, Reimer's parents told him the truth. He chose to begin calling himself David, and he underwent surgical procedures to revert the female bodily modifications.\n\nDavid Reimer's case came to international attention in 1997 when he told his story to Milton Diamond, an academic sexologist, who persuaded Reimer to allow him to report the outcome in order to dissuade physicians from treating other infants similarly. Soon after, Reimer went public with his story, and John Colapinto published a widely disseminated and influential account in Rolling Stone magazine in December 1997. This was later expanded into The New York Times best-selling biography As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl (2000), in which Colapinto described how‚Äîcontrary to Money's reports‚Äîwhen living as Brenda, Reimer did not identify as a girl. He was ostracized and bullied by peers (who dubbed him \"cavewoman\"), and neither frilly dresses nor female hormones made him feel female.\n\nOn 1 July 2002, Brian was found dead from an overdose of antidepressants. On 4 May 2004, after suffering years of severe depression, financial instability, and marital troubles, David committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a sawed-off shotgun at the age of 38. Reimer's parents have stated that Money's methodology was responsible for the deaths of both of their sons.\n\nMoney argued that media response to the expos√© was due to right-wing media bias and \"the antifeminist movement.\" He said his detractors believed \"masculinity and femininity are built into the genes so women should get back to the mattress and the kitchen\". However, intersex activists also criticized Money, stating that the unreported failure had led to the surgical reassignment of thousands of infants as a matter of policy. Privately, Money was mortified by the case, colleagues said, and as a rule did not discuss it. Money's own views also developed and changed over the years.",

The kicker, is that the people with the power to make the changes we need, don't believe the science. The oceans are dying and we're knowingly killing them while we sit back and believe that the oceans are to big to fail. \n\nAs a fishing guide in the northern pacific, I have seen the writing on the wall. The sea weed and kelp are is horrifying decline. Area's that used to be covered in hectares of bull kelp, have little to none now. Ocean plants are one of the first indicators of raising acidity in our oceans. \n\nNext, the starfish are disappearing. They used to be stuck on every pier pilling, breakwater, and stone in the ocean. Now it's almost rare to see more than one or two. Again, these animals are very basic and they are some of the first to be affected. \n\nThe biggest worry however, are the tiny organisms that feed everything. The changing PH and temperature of the ocean is killing off the plankton and creating an environment where they are far less abundant. This is going to be devastating to the oceans, because they are the starting blocks of the food chain.\n\nPlankton feeds the smaller fish and animals that the rest of the ocean feed on. From the smallest surf birds, to the largest mammals on earth.  If we lose the plankton, we lose the life in the oceans. When the oceans die, the earth dies. \n\nNone of what I've typed here is my opinion. It's fact. Taken from many oceanography books and biological studies that I have read.

A lot of her young life is hearsay from her family. So supposedly, when her mom was giving birth to her a doctor wasn't immediately available and nurse told her mom to keep her legs closed to keep the baby in while they try to get a doctor. Her legs stayed closed for 2 hours and deprived her of oxygen. This likely led to her development problems where she learned to walk much later than when someone is supposed to. She's reported to have been mentally disabled to some level and is said to have the reading ability of a fourth grader at 15 years old. After going to the United Kingdom to present to the royal family she apparently was different when she came back. She experienced seizures and violent mood swings. To deal with this, her father Joseph Kennedy had a lobotomy performed on her at 23 years old which effectively turned her into a vegetable. Afterwards she could not walk, speak intelligibly, and experienced involuntary urination. Later she did learn to walk again but, with a limp. She went on to live to the age of 86 having spent 73% of her life in that state.\n\nIt should be mentioned that part of what influenced Joseph Kennedy's decision is his fear that Rosemary's behavior would embarrass his family and hurt both his and his children's political career. On top of that he had the lobotomy performed with his wife's knowledge. Her father never visited her at the institution she resided in after the lobotomy and her siblings went years without knowing her whereabouts or what happened to her. They didn't find out what happened to her until Joseph suffered a stroke that took away his ability to speak in 1961 \\*ironic\\*. The lobotomy did not become public knowledge until 1987 and it happened in 1941. That's more time than there is between 1987 and the present day. It's also believed that Rosemary is part of the reason why her sister Eunice founded the special Olympics.",

            "text": "One of the reasons there are laws and statutes on the books preventing your employer from forcing you to work in hazardous conditions is because in the late 1920's, young women in a town in New Jersey began dying from horrible, agonizing illnesses that appeared to make no sense.\n\nEarly symptoms included exhaustion, loose teeth, joint problems, wounds that wouldn't heal, and agonizing pain in the face. It inevitably escalated to the gradual dissolving of the bones in the jaw (one woman's jawbone fell out entirely), then wasting away as other bones rotted inside of them and finally a painful death. Doctors accused some of the women suffering of having contracted an STD. \n\nIt took YEARS of expensive legal work by the young women suffering from this mysterious illness to finally identify the source- during WWI they had all worked at the same factory that painted glow-in-the-dark dials for watches. To work more efficiently they were instructed by supervisors to point their paintbrushes by sucking on the tip of them. \n\nKnown to the company but unknown to the women, the radium that caused the paint to glow was dangerously radioactive. Due to the unique properties of radiation, it was especially deadly when ingested. Not only was the company aware of this, they had been covering up research on the dangerous properties of radiation and had even hired a fake doctor when women started getting sick to convince them they were suffering from syphilis. While dozens of women were dying agonizing deaths, their employers were not only actively covering up their complicity but continued to knowingly employ other women in the same dangerous conditions.\n\nWhen exposed, the company used legal loopholes to try to avoid paying for medical treatment for the dying women, including stalling the courts in the hopes the women would die before a verdict was reached. The case against the United States Radium Company was responsible for changing a lot of labor laws that protect workers from harm. \n\nAnd after that no workers were ever put in danger again-\n\nAha just kidding the exact same thing happened in two other states over the next decade, with companies that used radium actively lying to their (working class female) employees about the dangers of radiation despite full knowledge they were killing them. They didn't stop until public opinion turned against them and stringent legal statutes were put in place to protect workers.\n\nNever forget that plenty of companies would gladly kill you if it meant protecting their bottom line.",
