The high-pitched frequency and acoustic timbre of his scream, which also gets compared to that of [R2-D2](https://youtu.be/Gfgd0TOXhss)\n\n3. The casual, unconcerned, deadpan way in which the cameraman says, \"Shit, you alright?\" while continuing to film and offering no actual assistance.\n\n4. The incredulous and somewhat condescending way in which the cameraman subsequently says, \"What the fuck!?\" \n\n5. The slow-motion instant replay.\n\n6. The even-slower-motion instant replay of the slow-motion instant replay, which brings an even more humorous quality to the pitch and tone of the scream.\n\nI'm legitimately not delighting at the kid's injury. The sound of the actual faceplant is disturbing and distressing, and I truly feel bad for him. The rest of it, however, completely outweighs the sympathy and I laugh every time.",

Pushing past the sad part about the bird dying, the likelihood of this happening AND getting caught so perfectly on camera is staggeringly low.\n\nThen there's his initial reaction. He is fully dumbfounded that something has just struck him in the face and neck, right when he's about to have the time of his life on a brand new ferrari Roller coaster.\n\nBut THEN, he realised what's now wrapped around his neck like a scarf is a fucking fresh bird carcass and let's out the funniest shriek I could think to make. He let's go off the bird and it disappears behind him, presumably into someone else's face.\n\nHis buddy on the left sees his mate holding up his hand and thinks he's trying to give him the fucking dap like \"yeah bro I'm so stoked we're travelling at breakneck speeds right now, give me some skiiiin cuz!\" Even he looks confused before he realises the guy is covered in bird blood\n\nI'm literally trying not to burst out laughing or shake the bed while typing this as my wife is sleeping next to me right now.

A friend J comes over to see if anyone wants to go to Erie ( we live in Pittsburgh) so Ian, his sister, and her boyfriend all leave the house to go while kees and I stayed behind for the weekend. So the same night we were drinking and kees jumped over the side railing on to the steps( like a 3 ft extra drop) and broke a stair clean through ( the bottom was exposed it was directly over the basement stairs) luckily the carpet didn't rip and actually saved most of its shape. We decided not to fix it but wait til they came home and fell through the hole( the drop was only a few feet, but the carpet wouldn't let you fall through. Plus we were kids and didn't think things through) so we waited 2 days, laughing our asses off, just waiting. We get a call Saturday night, Js truck broke down on the way there, no one had a cell phone yet so the had to get to a farm house to make the call. I told them I didn't have the gas but we worked every angle we could to get them home( we need to see them trip) we ended up getting a tow truck to drive them back to Carnegie through Justins mom after we tracker her down. We rush home, and wait, and laugh. Now they come in the front door, we can't stand it, just killing us. Suddenly they are up stairs with us, at this point we remember the other flight of stairs ( it used to be a duplex before the old owners made it one house) we hid our disappointed faces. The boyfriend of the sister ask for a beer, we sadly tell him they are in the kitchen. He goes down our stairs, new level of excitement. He falls in, caught by carpet screaming what the fuck. We can't stop laughing, took us an hour to explain the story to them. To this day I think about it and laugh",

We’ll call the kid Buddy.  \n\nI was sitting on the bench keeping an eye on Buddy thinking about how much he looks like his dad. How our group of dudes from our unit came together to raise this boy after his\nMom passed. How intelligent and witty Buddy is growing up to—\n\n“Tio!”, Buddy yells from across the park. It’s a distressed  “Tio” so I move quickly to find him. Buddy is standing under the slide in some shade breathing deeply.  “What’s up dude?” I ask.  \n“ I have asthma” he says. \n\nMy eyes go wide.  His dad never told me the boy has asthma. All I have in my pack are grapes, a sandwich, and fancy water (lemon, cucumber, and mint water). “Buddy I don’t have an inhaler for you.” I pick him up and walk to the car. \n\n“You think we left yours at home?” I ask. \n\n“Oh shiiid” he says. I sit with him on my lap and go through some deep breathing exercises while I get ready to call emergency. Then I notice he’s breathing fine.\n\nMe:  “Hey man, when did you go to the doctor to get your inhaler?”\n\nBuddy: “We didn’t go to a doctor.” \n\nMe: “Well how do you know you have asthma?”\n\nBuddy looks in my eyes with full confidence and says “I have asthma because when I run, I breathe hard.” \n\nOk so the inner asshole in me wanted to laugh at this kid so hard. I had to push that down. I love this kid so much and I don’t want to damage his confidence.  So I take out my phone and we watch a little video about asthma and what it is.  We both learned something about asthma that day.  Apparently a kid Buddy knows has asthma and an inhaler and he thinks it’s just the coolest thing ever.  \nBuddy is 11 now and wants to be a WW2 historian.",

Which made the walkie-talkie question make more sense. I feel bad for laughing so hard I turned purple, and I apologized.  She said no worries. Everyone handles bad news differently.\n\nBut it still makes me chuckle every time I hear it in my head. I think now I just chuckle at the whole situation and how badly I handled the news.

The guy didn't know what his gf usually made and brought, so he made baked potatoes.\n\nNow I know this normally wouldn't evoke more than a sensible chuckle, but to me it was so hilarious thinking about this guy who was so clueless as to what a bake sale was, he basically just went \"You sell baked goods at a Bake Sale.  What can I bake and bring?  I know how to make baked potatoes.  Baked potatoes are baked, its literally in the name.  I'll bring those\", and he shows up with a bunch of old ladies selling sweets while he's dishing out potatoes with all the fixings.  He sold all his stock, so it was a success, but the realization must've hit like a truck when he showed up and everyone had cookies, brownies, pastries, and other confectioneries, and he just sets up a table for potatoes, sticking out like a sore thumb.\n\nMy gf likes to make fun of me for my horrible sense of humor, but it still makes me giggle whenever she brings it up.",

Whatever happened next & how long I was waiting is a little fuzzy, but all I remember is looking over to the car parked next to us & seeing my mom in the driver’s seat of that car distractedly looking at the important letter she had received. Yes, somehow she had gotten into the wrong car (and just her luck, of course it was unlocked) and hadn’t even realized that it wasn’t her vehicle and that her son wasn’t in the passenger’s seat next to her. I just remember looking out the window in utter shock and, being the momma’s boy that I was, screaming “MOM!!!!!!!!” in horror. Eventually (she was probably only in there for a minute or less) she looked to her side & our eyes locked and she ran out of the strange car & into ours.

I started dying laughing and couldn’t stop for ten minutes. I’m choking with my 3 month old daughter on my chest asleep trying not to laugh and wake her just typing this. I look so stupid but my response will never not be a laugh. I don’t want to offend anyone who has seizures because I take it very seriously and the pain and fear of loved ones is enough to make you feel guilty just for suffering from them.

Anything being taken too seriously just floors me.\n\nFor instance, I work at a shirt printing factory. At one meeting two of our head honchos were leading, they took a minute to stress how important quality control is, especially as to making sure the image on the shirt is actually the right one. Very seriously, in a hushed tone, the leader tells us about a very upset customer. Her son was awaiting his little league shirt. When the package arrived and he opened it he was horrified and shocked to have received some heavy metal shirt which he said was \"Too graphic to be described!\" \n\nI started giggling and Could. Not. Fucking. Stop. For real, I have a hard time controlling my laughter sometimes, it's kind of a nervous habit. I was literally in tears trying to stifle myself. Luckily no one paid me any mind, but I was so embarrassed and thought for sure I'd get in trouble. The dude sitting next to me happened to be someone I was trying to make friends with as well so I thought fuck, he's going to think I'm just plain dumb. The next day they actually had the two of working together. He walked up behind me and without preamble said, \"I thought it was pretty funny, too.\" Which sent me back into spastic laughter...",

It sucks to hear that she got HIV”, to which he replied “Bro I said she got HPV, not HIV. Not the same thing”. Without skipping a beat I proclaimed, “You didn’t ask for HPV, you asked for HIV!” in Amanda Bynes’ fake Eastern European immigrant child accent. He replied “YAGA!”, we both burst out laughing, then stopped and with serious faces we determined that we should never joke about this ever, after agreeing that it was however disgustingly funny.\n\nAnother one was MadTV’s “Gay Gangster Fight” skit from the mid-2000s, featuring Key and Peele before they were known as the iconic duo.

Last thing I need is my kid saying weird stuff in front of company and making us look like odd parents. Swear words get a time out under most circumstances. So when he said he loved his poop and waited for me to react, I didn’t. He talks about poopy stuff all the time and we’re pretty tired of it. Then he said in the same voice, “Ahhhhh, I just love my Butthole.” And I fucking lost it. So did his mom. And now every once in a while, when we aren’t laughing at his weird jokes, he’ll hit us with “Ahhhh… I just love my butthole” and it usually works. God damnit.",

One day when she was done using it she put it inside my older brothers hat that was sitting on the kitchen counter. I have no idea why she put it there but she did. Later on my brother was going to go out so he grabbed his hat and the Gameboy went flying out of the hat, and smashed onto the kitchen floor. The thing was totaled, I mean completely broken in half. My sister was devastated of course, but that’s not the funny part. \n\nMy brother of course felt awful about this even though it wasn’t his fault and wanted to replaced it with a new Gameboy, but he decided to have some fun with it. Christmas was coming up and he got her a new Gameboy but before he gave it to her, he took the old Gameboy, badly taped it together, backwards, put it in a plastic sandwich bag, covered it in melted peanut butter and cornflakes, wrapped it up nicely and gave it to her for Christmas. My sister was upset upon opening it but was soon after ecstatic to receive her new Gameboy, or maybe it was a DS Lite, I don’t remember. \n\nThis was like 15 years ago and to this day I still can’t get through telling this story without losing my shit, it was so damn funny.",

She hadn’t driven that vehicle in a couple of months but when she tried to go to the store she saw they were flat. That was her “grocery shopping car” and she only drove it to get groceries.\n\nThat car wasn’t on her policy. I ask if it belonged to someone else, nope. I asked if it was insured with another company, nope. I asked if maybe she removed it off her policy, nope. She then insisted that because she had one car covered all of her cars are covered. I had to explain to her that’s not how our insurance worked and I had never heard of that being a method of any other insurance company.\n\nThe funny part way she asked me “so all this time I’ve been driving this car and I haven’t had insurance on it?!” and I told her that I can’t know if it has insurance. All I could tell her is that it wasn’t insured with us. She *almost* took responsibility. I could practically hear the gears come to a screeching halt as she forced herself to not take responsibility and to turn around and blame me. She went from friendly, to confused, to shocked, to worried, briefly to understanding and wanting to work out a resolution, then snapped to anger.\n\nWhat made it dumb was besides the obliviousness of it she tried to tell me that I didn’t know how far insurance worked, that it’s always been that way for everyone, and I’m lying to her her in trouble and to force her to pay me more money. She somehow talked herself into thinking I was the sole owner and operator of one of the largest insurance companies in America while also demanding to talk to someone else.\n\nBefore anyone yells at me about her being old, she wasn’t *that* old I there was nothing in our conversation that come across as her possibly being sick. She was just an older lady who thought she knew more than someone so much younger and when faced with the possibility of that not being true she raged out.\n\nI tell that story once every few weeks and it always makes me chuckle.",

I always had the hardest time trying to read some of the stories that were submitted. I don't know why but many of them tried SO hard to sound \"literary\" that it would always set me off laughing.\n\nI think part of the problem was just how jarring it was to go from seeing pictures of dead deer, ducks, how-to articles, etc. and then turning the page and being thrown into a 2-3 page story that was flowery and almost religious in how it was written about a particular hunting trip. The stories were always well written but because of that abrupt transition it always made it seem like the writer was trying too hard or something and I'd start laughing.",

I paid for this ticket, can you bring them back?\" Then you hear the plane take off. \n\nAlong these lines is alot of swearing, or demand to speak to the manager, when one person says \"im entitled to get on that plane.\" We ask if they read the ToS, which 90% of the time, they don't, and we explain in the strictest and nicest way possible of once a plane dispatches, we cant bring it back, unless they have a physical emergency.\n\nSome people are reasonable and get on the next flight, some make excuses which are plain stupid because you know they are lying.
