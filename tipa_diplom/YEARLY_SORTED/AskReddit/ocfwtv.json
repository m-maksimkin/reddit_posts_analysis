At this swap meet there was a vendor selling seasoned peanuts in their shell. Up to this point all I had dealt with peanuts was deshelled store bought type stuff, most with spicy seasoning or just salted. Anyway, I know from cartoons and probably the Mr. Peanut ads that sometimes they come inside this shell casing thing but I didnt know exactly what that was, never even thought about how any nut grew or where they came from. So at this swap meet the vendor had a cement mixer where he had all these nuts and poured in seasoning to mix and when you ordered some he would stop the mixer and scoop some out. For som reason, I thought that you put in (deshelled) peanuts into this magical machine and it would slowly coat them with this shell thing. Couldn't figure out how they got it to make that waffle like pattern but by this point we watched enough modern marvels to know there is  machinery that does all sorts of crazy things.   \nSo wondering if I was correct,I asked my dad about it. Thing to note here is that I was a relentless litle dick as a kid and this happening maybe two hours after walking around in the hot ass sun probably asking for everything I saw my dad probably just wanted to shut me up. I asked if thats how peanuts got their shells. Either he didn’t understand exactly what I was asking or (for sure) he just wanted to shut me up, he said yes. I should have noticed because he just off handedly answered and rushed us off to the hot ass car since we were leaving.   \nFast forward through school years, the military, and a marriage... I saw a documentary on George Washington Carver and it showed a glimpse of peanuts being harvested. My mind was blown. This whole time my dad had been fucking with me and it was just one of those things that didn’t come up for some reason nor did I ever research on my own for me to discover earlier that my dad was way wrong.

Anyway, I'm just not comfortable with using the small forks. It's not how I was raised, and I'd have to adapt to such a massive lifestyle change, and... I can't do it right now. Can you please find it in your heart to forgive me? Wait, hold on, where are you going? Please don't do this to me, I want to make things right again. Make us right. Don't just walk away from me. Please, I beg you. I'll use the small forks for dessert. I will. Just give me one last chance. I swear I'm not the man I was before. You gotta believe me. Where are you going?

I didn’t learn until a few days ago that microwaving metal might start a fire. \n\nHow can I not know? I don’t own any (edited for clarity) metal cups, plates, bowls or serving dishes at home. I know not to leave cutlery in the microwave, but I didn’t know it’s because they’re made of metal. ALL this time, I thought not putting forks in a microwave is simply an indisputable fact of life without any need for an explanation. I’ve never questioned it. I just do. And I lived happily ever after alongside this ignorance. \n\nUNTIL I don’t anymore. \n\nDuring a volunteer shift I was asked to microwave several pet food bowls for our finicky eaters. One of the other volunteers quickly pointed out there are paper plates nearby and then left. I didn’t get it. Why would I need paper plates? \n\nI couldn’t figure it out, there’s nobody around to ask, and the dogs need their dinners, so I just chucked the bowls in the microwave. The METAL bowls. What are those crackling sounds? Huh, that’s strange, some sparks are flying. Yeesh maybe this microwave is old. \n\nJust as I started wondering if I should take the bowl out, another volunteer walked past, spotted my innocent attempt at arson and straight up divebombed into the kitchen yelling STOP STOP STOP!! TAKE IT OUT!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\n\nLuckily I stopped the microwave before armageddon happened. Unluckily, I now must explain myself. The sheer LOOK on this poor soul’s face when I honestly told him I didn’t know is still branded to the back of my mind. I swear I could almost hear his thoughts. Am I lying? Has an arsonIST (cheers, grammar nazis) successfully infiltrated their organization? Am I just that dumb? Is it possible to be so dumb? What ELSE do I not know about the world? Am I an alien studying human life?\n\nLong story short, the other volunteer gave an overly detailed explanation about why metals can’t go into microwaves, I apologized profusely, and now I don’t volunteer there anymore.",

In my defense, I grew up in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, and neither of those locations have armadillos. \n\n\n\nSo when I moved to Georgia, one of the guys in the office warned me \"Oh yeah, if you see a gray dodge ball in the road, it's probably an armadillo.

I had meant to say \"are extinct\" but I was super wrong regardless. Just to illustrate how wrong I was, he trapped an armadillo in his yard that weekend and brought it to work in his jeep just to prove he wasn't fucking with me (it was humanely released into a wooded area further from his wife's vegetable garden after it was used to mock me relentlessly).",

It was tough growing up in a ruthless environment. Also, the fact that life is unfair, that we’re all fundamentally lonely, and you have to be selfish, never show weakness…even to trustees, and understand that people are fickle and capricious and that you should have to hide a part bad parts of yourself to pick yourself up by the bootstraps.

I had a dog growing up who always lived outside in her “doghouse”, or in the garage during the winter. Even when she was elderly with arthritis and got cancer, she stayed out there🥺😢. As a child I remember looking at her through the sliding glass door as she wagged her tail excitedly, or walking out to the garage and she’d be sleeping by the door. It took me getting own dog to make the connection as to why it’s wrong on so many levels and plain cruel to do so. \nNow I think back to the memories I have of her being so exited to see us and staring at her ‘excitedness’ thru the glass and I feel AWFUL. \nNow, I think that anyone -no matter the breed or the purpose, that makes their dog live outside is cruel and should think twice about their reasons for having one. Dogs are smart social pack animals, mans bestest of friends, doggy children of humans. They should not be left outside alone even if there is more than 1 of them. Sorry to be THAT reply.

My drawings were never the colour they had to be, instead they were correct only for my eyes. My classmates kept telling me that my browm pencil is actually orange and I just ignored it.\n\nThen we went to a doctor about it.\n\nThats how I learned that seeing a green sunset or a red moon is not normal",

My mom called me from work and told me to put my little brothers comforter in the washing machine. In my confusion I asked her which one it was. She told me it was the colorful one with the designs on it. Well both the comforter (what I was thinking was only called a blanket) AND the mattress had colorful designs so I asked her “are you sure it’s going to fit?” Wondering how the hell she was gonna get this mattress into our  tiny little washing machine. My mom, still talking about the comforter, said ya don’t worry about it you can fold it up and it’ll all fit in there. At this point I’m looking at the mattress amazed that you can fold it in such a way that it’ll fit in the washer but if my mom says it’ll fit then I guess it’ll fit. So I tell her ok and then literally spend about an hour maneuvering the mattress from my brothers room from upstairs all the way down the stairs, through the living room, and into our small little laundry room by myself. I propped it up against the wall and realized I didn’t know how to fold it to get it in but at least I got it down there right? I’ll just wait for my mom to get home. Couple hours later I hear my dad yell for me to come to the laundry room and explain why my brothers mattress was taking up half the space in there. I explained it to him and he was equal parts impressed and disappointed in the stupid human he had created. I was so embarrassed, I begged him to help me take it back upstairs before my mom got home and found out and he refused. Said my mom would need to see what I had done. That’s also the first time I heard the phrase “common sense is not so common”.",

He had colored a tree, brown leaves and green trunk.  I told my mother that he was color blind.  My mother told me I couldn’t know that as I was too young.   Fast forward and my brother is in the army and applying for chopper pilot.  He failed due to being color blind.   I told you so, hahaha.  Part two.   A few years earlier I was in 11th grade and was taken to store to pick out a new suit.  I picked out what I thought was, to me, a funny but acceptable grayish brownish suit with a black tie.  My parents wondered if, in fact, I wanted that particular suit with that tie.  Ehhhh.  I liked it.  Wore it every Sunday to church.   Fast forward to college.  The college I went to insisted that freshmen learn table, group, restaurant etiquette and manners so every evening was dedicated to all freshmen lining up outside a grand dining room waiting to be seated in groups of eight around big tables so they could be served evening meal.  We males were required to wear suits.   I was standing in line waiting to be seated when I mentioned that another person was sort of dressed in a funny color combo suit.  I remember the jacket being brown which I mentioned to a friend.  He said it was not brown but an olive color.  I asked several people around and all agreed.  Then I asked about my suit jacket and where I saw greyish brownish everyone else saw olive.  That’s when I found I was also color blind to certain versions of olive and not able to see the green in them.  So between my brother and I, it was the colorblind leading the colorblind.",

I asked what \"divorce\" meant and my dad said it meant that Ted wouldn't be living with his family anymore. When I asked why this was happening, my dad said something to the effect of \"because he has different holes in his head from the rest of his family.\" I had just gotten over a bout with Chicken Pox and had had them really bad on my scalp, which made my scalp feel like it had dozens of little pits in it. I assumed that these were the \"holes\" my dad was talking about and this entire explanation weirdly made sense to me (I just assumed the holes-in-the-head thing was some sort of legal requirement for living with someone).\n\n\nFast forward five years and my parents sit ten-year-old little me down to tell me they're getting divorced.  After about 10 minutes of screaming and hyper-ventilating I asked my dad when the holes in his head changed and he had no clue what I was talking about (I think he assumed I was just babbling nonsense because I was so traumatized and I can't blame him, I was losing my shit).\n\n\nFast forward to just a few weeks ago, my dad is visiting and I happen to mention the original Ted Musgrave story.  Dad has no clue what I'm talking about, doesn't recall saying that at all.  I look up Ted Musgrave and he has NEVER been divorced.

I could talk about this all night and I'm aware most people aren't this interested in sewage. \n\nThanks for your considered responses and open mindedness. I've enjoyed this exchange 🙂",
