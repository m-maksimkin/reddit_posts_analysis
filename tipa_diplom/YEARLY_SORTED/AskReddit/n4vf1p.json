When my parents divorced and I moved out of state to live with my mom's side of the family, I knew I wasn't going to stay there.  I would make enough money to move back home and support myself, but in the mean time I might as well do whatever because I don't plan on being back.  So I figured, screw my reputation, Imma make my own rep and be a character then bounce.  So, I bought a $500 redneck rigged coupe that was rebuilt from two wrecked cars, it was dark red in the front and a weird green in the back.  Everywhere I went, I ALWAYS had a grinder full of weed, a lighter, a small bowl, and papers.  I basically strictly wore old tshirts and cargo shorts in the summer and cheap button ups and jeans in the winter.  And to top it all of (literally) I wore a fedora whenever I left the house, specifically because I knew it annoyed people.  My goal was to try to basically be like a real life reoccurring character that you'd see in a TV show or something, and I'd say mission complete.  After a couple years people would be like, \"There's that stoned sonuvabitch in his frankencar and dumbass fedora.\"  But hey, I smoked a looooot of people up so I was still fun at least.  After I moved back to my hometown I was regular old me again, but I'll always carry a bit of that stoned sonuvabitch with me.",

Clothes, hair, mannerisms, voice. \n\nGirls started hanging around me, including me in things that i had never \nbeen invited to before.    One of the girls who I really liked said \"hey, can I ask you a personal question?\"   Heart racing, \"yeah, anything!\"    She comes close to my ear and whispers, \"are you dating anyone?\"   I just about fell out of my chair, but managed to stammer out a no. \n\"Good\" she said with a sly smile and walked away. \n\nFew days later I run into Bruce, who is now acting very friendly toward me.   Not in a mocking way, but genuinely asking questions about games, etc.\n\nI invited him to my house to play computer games.    We played in the living room, and my mom was making snacks and stuff.   She kept looking weirdly at him, and me but said nothing.\n\nAs Bruce was leaving, he gave me a long hug and said he had a great time.   I was like \"uh, okay man. Talk to you tomorrow.\"   \n\nMom and Dad call me into the kitchen for a talk:  \"Kyle, we just want you to know that it's okay if you want to talk to us about anything that's going on in your life.   You can tell us anything.  We'll support you.\"    \n\nOkay, nice, but kinda awkward?  \n\nNext day the girl was like \"so, you and Bruce had a good time?\"   \nMe: \"sure, played some games.\"   \nHer: \"and?\" (with that same sly smile)\nMe: \"and he lost the game.\"\nHer: \"I hate it when that happens.

Huge shirts and jeans, spent an hour every day starching up my jeans (which probably should've been spent doing any amount of homework at all...), I wore them cuffed with Nike Cortez's on. That ended sophomore year. Came back junior year with super skinny jeans and neon colored shirts.

            "text": "Had a 3 year period between 19 and 22 where I was fully committed to new age bullshit. Like everything, crystal energy powers, energy healing any health issue, reiki, metaphysics, all that stuff. \n\nTo the point my mom was into it too and she met some \"energy healer\" family from was originally from the Ukraine and then lived in Florida in a giant rural mansion property. They befriended us, and invited us to live on that property for a few months studying energy healing and metaphysics. \n\nSo we went, left our lives in California to pursue this goal. It went alright initially, other than the constant 1000 dollar \"classes\" on metaphysics that were just us and one of the other family members being the teacher. You'd think that would've been the breaking point, but no I was a firm believer. \n\nMy actual breaking point occured when I was 23-24. I have poor eyesight, can't see shit past 8 inches from my face. I was wearing CRT contacts up until this point (hard lenses you wear at night, take off in the morning, and your eye holds the shape for 24 hours so you can see without glasses or soft contacts). They told me they could fix my eyesight, but it would require me to stop wearing my lenses. I was wearing these lenses since I was 12 and they also prevent my prescription from getting worse, just freezes it whenever you first start wearing them. So this was a big deal to just stop them. \n\nWell guess what dumb move I made...stopped wearing them and was then told I couldn't get glasses either. So now I'm stuck basically blind for 12 MONTHS hoping my eyes will get magically fixed by a dude waving his hand across the table from me for 10 mins once a week. As if that's an alternative to lasik. Unfortunately this meant I could no longer drive myself, or be independent or even get a job. I developed a bad habit of just watching YouTube videos 12 hours a day with my face 8 inches from the screen. This eventually led my double vision because a muscle in my right eye got a bit weak from this. \n\nWhen 12 months went by and not only was my eyesight not better, but I was still technically growing a bit so my prescription actually got worse by a good amount. Went from -4.5 to my current -6.75, plus having double vision that require thick prism lenses too. This broke me, burned me, and completely destroyed my world view of the previous 4 years. Overnight I was done. \n\nThis fucked me up a lot mentally, because I was so deep into that movement that I no longer use any scientific understandings of the world like I did growing up. It caused a lot of existential anxiety, and ultimately led to getting triple diagnosed with a panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and HF-ASD (this one was hinted at from tests done as a child). I had sever 12 hour long panic attacks that changed my brain chemistry permanently, and now I have to live in a new normal that's objectively worse internally than how I used to be. \n\nI've healed a lot since then, moved back to my home state of California, and have relearned my scientific understanding of the universe since then. I'm 29 now, and I still feel traumatized from that experience. Even after therapy, and meds. It only helps to a certain degree, but my fundamental reality got fucked and never properly fixed. Plus you want to talk about trust issues? How about both your parents and everyone you knew telling you one thing is true, for YEARS, only to discover in my own it's all bullshit. I used to be too gullible, and now I'm overcorrecting and very skeptical of everyone and everything. \n\nSadly my parents only learned not to give money to people like that but still totally believe in energy work nonsense. It causes a lot of conflict when I interact with them, and that pains me. Because they are such good people otherwise. \n\nI still get furious at myself and the people who convinced me to believe in that bullshit. It became the most pivotal moment of my life, and has caused me permanent health problems as a result. Don't let anyone convince you of anything without getting some other opinions and research first. Don't trust your mind.\n\nEdit - I appreciate all the interest you guys have in my story. I never knew it was anything too special or unique. My parents have downplayed it the entire time to the point I didn't think what I felt was valid. Even when I told the story to friends they didn't have the same reaction you guys have. \n\nIdk about writing a book though lol, but you definitely have made it clear I can present the full version of this story somewhere and that there could be some interest in it. I can gladly answer any questions you have. Maybe I'll do an AMA on one of the subs for that.\n\nEdit 2 - there are many details and parts of this story I've left out for the sake of being concise. I can answer questions, and elaborate on anything you would like to know more about. Details about the energy healer family, what I specifically believed in and \"practiced\", and the years of aftermath that have left their scars one to this day. I'm glad people can use my story as an example of what not to do in life when faced with similar choices and beliefs.",

I had this whole \"dumb blonde\" thing when I was in middle school that I embodied after them. Thought I was the funniest, ditsy,  fun loving Karen the world had ever seen. Obviously, I was very offended by my parents telling me this was a phase that I would one day regret. Once I hit high school I realized how stupid I was being and how right my parents were. I couldn't help but think how annoyed everyone must have been with me. I sunk into a pretty deep depression from how embarrassed I was by my former self (and a million other factors). I kept sinking lower until I wound myself up in the hospital as a late teen. Consumed with regret and hatred towards the shell of a person I created for myself that I was stuck to live in. This was also said to be a phase that I would snap out of once I grew up. \n\nNowadays, I'm in my mid twenties, married, and have a kid. I am happy to report that I am slowly making progress towards being content with my past, though I still struggle with my mental health quite a bit. \n\nMy family and friends still like to make fun of the fact that I was \"quite the character\" in my teens (unaware to this still being a sore spot for me). But while they were right in how that was a phase I would indeed regret, they were unfortunately wrong about my \"teenage angst\" being something I would snap out of.    Oh well though, live and learn. I'm looking forward to the day when I can look back fondly, and laugh at it all. I know I'll get there someday. \n\nSide note: Boy o boy, is it ever easy to ramble about things I would never normally ramble about if I weren't anonymous lol.

The teacher in charge was pretty supportive but very critical about certain things. I began to get discouraged. \n\nI stopped really enjoying it around that time. Only because it wasn't fun anymore. Classmates criticized my work, teachers would request me to make videos or slideshows for them, and it *had* to be their own way. I also started getting really into the environment and our impact around that time. \n\nBy junior year my focus shifted from making videos to our impact on the planet, especially our coastline and the erosion of our marshlands. My whole summer was spent down in Cameron, LA and on Holly Beach cleaning up, learning about the bayous and marshes. How our impact was desecrating our coast. The spring of my senior year I got to go to Dulac with the environmental club. Spending my spring break there really made me want to go into ecology.

Then one day, my parents, my then-girlfriend-now-wife, and I were getting ready to go out for dinner, but I ran out of hairspray.  I still slicked back my hair, but it ended up drying and becoming a bit poofy, and I was so embarrassed.  Turned out, my girlfriend loved it a lot more than the slicker look, because she didn't like so much hair product put in hair (which I did do), and I looked my age a lot better than my other style, said I look like I'm close to mid-thirties with the original look.  I was 23 at the time.  Don't get me wrong, she wasn't insulting me, just speaking her mind, she said she wasn't going to make me change it.  But I decided to give the dry look a try but instead of combing it back, I put it in a more traditional combover style and ended up loving it.  Nowadays, I have the sides cut shorter than the top, but still combed over. \n\n\n For the 3 people who want to know how I did the slicker look, here's a quick tutorial:\n\n1. Wet hair\n2. Comb hair back.  You can do a part if desired.\n3. Spray hairspray ALL OVER HAIR LIBERALLY while hair is wet.  I prefer Rave's pump hairspray.  The aerosol variant works too but I like the pump spray because I don't have to worry about getting my surroundings sticky as much.\n4.  Allow hair to dry, while remaining in desired style.  Once dry, it is basically impenetrable.\n\nDo you see why I stopped now?",

And even K-pop was shifting from its second generation to its third generation, which featured more hip-hop groups.\n\nI was floored but unable to change the trajectory of my academic and vocational direction at that point.

Stretched my ears with random objects I found around the house and/or tapers my friends stole from Spencer‚Äôs (still have these and actually still like the way they look since they‚Äôre a modest size, which is good because they‚Äôll never go back to normal from improper care). Used sewing needles to pierce my various places on my ears, septum, smiley, belly button, etc. \n\nI once used a disposable twin blade razor to add layers to my hair and spent hours every day on straightening and teasing my hair to look like a mushroom, essentially. \n\nThe look was never complete without neon eye shadow and obnoxious cat eye/black raccoon-esque eyeliner. I‚Äôd cut, rip, and draw on all my clothes - which consisted of Tripp skinny jeans and band t-shirts from hot topic, chunky plastic little kid jewelry, fingerless gloves, and Converse or Vans shoes.\n\nMy music taste, the posters on my walls, the way I talked and typed, my artistic expression like poetry and drawing - everything in my life was engrossed in this cringeworthy subculture for about 3 years.

            "text": "I had so many phases as a teenager. One of my favorites was my naturalist phase. \n\nAt one point I decided I was going to be a naturalist because I loved animals and nature. I collected all the dead animal artifacts my local Tennessee woods could offer, and opened up a nature museum in my parent‚Äôs unused shed. I studied, labeled, and mounted each of the artifacts and created themed exhibits (woodlands, ocean, geology, etc). People from my church and neighborhood would pay $20 a year to receive a monthly newsletter and see monthly exhibits. Non members were charged $1. I bought some taxidermy and artifacts, and friends and family donated some specimens as well. My humble museum even boasted international members (my aunt and grandparents in Japan). \n\nI started when I was 8 and ended the museum when I was 14 once I started working at an actual lab. I had quite a sizeable collection that I believe my parents threw away as soon as I left for college. Taxidermy and mounted skeletons of foxes, weasels, birds, rodents, and other creatures. Some bought, some donated, and some I had done by myself (my cat provided plenty of practice moles and rats). Other notable specimens included an entire dried Stingray, horseshoe crabs, , a mummified rabbit I found in the woods, deer pelts, various antlers, organs, snakes, and amphibians preserved in jars. \n\nI also had some live animals I kept for short periods of time as a zoo of sorts. Wild mice I caught, and a variety of insects, frogs, pond creatures, and snakes I caught, kept alive, studied for a few months before releasing them. I even had a sick raccoon, possum, and red tailed hawk at one point. I‚Äôm fairly certain that raccoon was rabied. I caught all three of them trying to kill my chickens and decided they were fair game to keep and nurse to health. I eventually released them in some woods far away once they were healthy. There were also gemstone, plant,  and rock collections. Also hundreds of posters I created where I drew different natural processes and explanations of different natural phenomenon and animal facts. It was a proper little nature museum. \n\nMy parents bought me all the books I could want on animals, nature, and naturalist how to‚Äôs. I loved reading about all kinds of animals, rocks, and plants. I would spend hours watching and identifying birds and other wildlife in the woods. I remember sitting completely still for hours patiently waiting underneath the feeder for a hummingbird to land on my hand. \n\nI still love nature and wildlife and would love to be a naturalist. I went on to get a degree in Biology and Chemistry and worked in labs for 7 years. Unfortunately I realized that the jobs I wanted were few and far between, and the pay was barely a living wage. I now volunteer with a wyoming wildlife conservation group and spend as much time outside as possible while going back to school for a real job. It remains one of my fondest childhood memories.",

Imagine an overly introvert, shy girl being pointed at with rumors like she is a whore etc \nSo I decided to talk to my mom( who was really conservative at the time and didn‚Äôt approve this kind of boy stuff) and I told her that I cannot live like this and that I want to leave school and begin home study. I can only imagine the cringe she felt. Gladly she made me realize that this is life, and I have to get up every time it plays tricks. Damn, so young and innocent years, this lesson is like the basic intro level of life in my head now.\n\nPS. Karma did her job; the boy started liking me for years with no fruit, and now we are friends and I‚Äôm his biggest (for fun) bully and still laugh about that time.",

A lot of times, shows and books that really move me will spark new interests for me that usually fade away after a while. This was the first time I ever experienced such phenomenon.\n\nEver since I watched that show, I wanted to be on AGT. It was my dream to someday go on that stage and perform for people. Well, I sooner or later \"realized\" That why should I wait, I should go on AGT now. So now I go around telling everyone that my new plan is that this November, I'm going to drive a state away, audition for this show, get on it, and win. Oh boy. \n\nAnd what was this so-called \"act\" that I wanted to preform? Well, I wanted to do roller-blading routines with my best friend. (Who, looking back, I was honestly quite manipulative to. She never really wanted to do such with me anyway.)\n\nBut, no. It gets worse. The insane nine year old that I was did not only plan this, but I actually got on the family computer and submitted online forms to register for my \"audition.\" I did this all without my parents knowing. I planned to tell them ON THE DAY OF THE AUDITION and I for some reason expected that they'd be on board. \n\nOf course, they eventually found out, and they were pissed. Which, if I found that my identity had been stolen by a manipulative egoistic nine year old, I would've been pissed off too. So, I got in massive (deserved) trouble, which killed my interest in the whole thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am SO glad that I never got away wit that... \\*shivers\\*",

The style immediately became super high maintenance - I went from only having to blow-dry it into shape to having to use a straightener and various sprays and that hair wax for guys. Then I though I'd just grow it out a bit into a \"pixie bob\" thing. It looked awful. My hair was damaged from the heat, it is thin and fragile so it just looked like fried, thin fuzzy old lady hair at the ends, plus it would still frizz in the humidity which is pretty intense where I live in the summer. People said some hurtful comments. One young woman about my age called it a \"herpee\" like a toupee but girl, that comment really crushed me because my hair falls out a lot from my severe anxiety disorder, so I thought that was very cruel. It's not within my control. I also got some homophobic slurs from older men. I don't blame that on the hair though. Getting my hair cut short made me realize what a problem homophobia is in my town.\n\nI got tired of all the work on this stupid haircut with no payoff, plus the ridicule and cruel comments. So I gave up and have switched back to my natural hair. My natural hair unfortunately looks. Um. Awful. It naturally curls to look like those guys from the early 1800s like...just think of those guys and you get the idea. :( It is taking for. EVER. To grow this hair out now because the curls are a lot healthier now that I'm on the right regimen. But this in turn has caused the curls to spring more and make them appear shorter. So they don't seem to be growing much even though they are. I haven't been able to tuck the curly \"fringe\" ringlets behind my ear for a year. If I straightened them they would be *just* almost tuck-able. I could at least blend them into my longer hair at my temples and pin them in place if I went back to straightening but I am not going back to that as it takes a long time to repair heat damaged curls. I also think straightening caused more hair loss, so it's not worth going back.\n\nI will stick to hats for now and am thinking about trying a wig as well. I'd probably wear the wig with a hat.",

This was before kpop stan twitter was around so it wasn‚Äôt as toxic but it was still stan twitter so it still had a lot of toxicity. The thing is I didn‚Äôt really fit in with most of the people on there and I was too oblivious at the time to realize that and look elsewhere. That wasn‚Äôt the worst of it though, ohhh no. My obsession with the celebrity at the head of it drove me to do things I regret. I threw away most of my free time obsessing over them and stalking their twitter (it didn‚Äôt help that they were very active.) I worked almost full time in high school at a job that drove me to severe depression just so I could get VIP at their concerts! Why!?! Why did I do something that would affect my mental health for the rest of my life just for that 1-2 hours of ‚Äúhappiness?‚Äù\n\nAt one point I got an xbox and sorta diverted from that but the obsession didn‚Äôt fully go away. Finally after 5 years it came to a head. I met them at a concert with a meet and greet ticket. After that I felt like I peaked. I did it. My biggest dream come true. Now, what comes next? Well I sorta idled around for awhile, smoking weed to help me work through my problems. \n\nNow a good friend of mine had been bringing me to this annual anime convention for 3 years. I enjoyed going because they had a rave and video game related stuff there, but anime never really clicked with me because of how closed minded I was up until this point. That obsessive energy I used to put into a celebrity had sorta built up over the course of 6 months and it all got thrown into anime. For once I felt happy. This happiness lasted for awhile until 2020 and covid struck. Now I‚Äôm back to being depressed at a similar level that I was in high school but it‚Äôs not all the same. I know I‚Äôm a different man now and being more open minded has helped me a lot. I actually talk to people online now instead of being alone tweeting out my feelings to deaf ears.",

I like being more open, and I am super social.\n\nOh, yea, I also started to live life based on fun and not being better than everyone else. Like I'm willing to try anything at least once so long as it isn't drugs or illegal",

However, I felt so disconnected from womanhood and my female peers-- that I just convinced myself I wasn't a woman at all.\n\nI thought and thought to myself about how \"women like girly things and they always yell at each other. I dont do that. I'm not like them, so I'm not a girl\". I hated the female stereotype and I hated the way I was treated growing up because of my sex, so I lived life as a trans boy between the ages of 12 to 17. \n\nI was about to go on hormone therapy when I turned 18, but shortly before I was scheduled to start taking hormones-- I had an epiphany. It was something I knew about myself deep down, but never feel thought deeply about until I was about to make that big change to myself.\n\nI understood that it was okay to be a woman who was more \"masculine\" / gender non-conforming. I could enjoy having short hair and dressing masculinely without actually identifying as a man. \n\nAnd ever since I learned that about myself, I've been much happier. I began viewing my fellow women as incredible people, rather than \"they are all secretly catty and love makeup and have no personality whatsoever\". Working with women helped me get over this. Listening to the women in my life helped me get over this.\n\nMy former coworker Patty grew up wanting to be a truck driver, and my friend Liz was going to school to be a mechanic. My neighbor Helen (before she passed) was an amazing artist who sold her paintings every year. I was surrounded by talented and inspirational women, but I never looked beyond the surface and the stereotypes.\n\nI regret that phase of my life because I disconnected myself from my family because I was told I should. I was told by my trans peers (online friends) that they didn't really love me-- which couldn't have been further from the truth. I am very loved by my family, and I'm still trying to get them back after I pushed them away.\n\nEver since I accepted myself, I began taking more pride in all that I do. I was more outgoing and I worked harder because I finally found my truth. I wasn't who I thought I was all those years. I wasn't transgender, but I was just a woman. A woman who isnt a stereotype. A woman with talents, dreams, and a life of my own.\n\n\nI mean no hate by this at all, but I wanted to provide my own experiences. What I went through may not be your experience, and that is okay. Be your you, and be happy. Whoever you wish to be in your life, be your absolute best!",

I urged my dad to build me a pc( a gt 710 pc which I absolutely despite now cuz it can't run shit), bought minecraft ( was playing cracked mc before that), got a stupid microphone and a fancy arm like mic stand . I remember spending a horrendous amount of time looking for a free video editing software. Found one called hitfilm express and spent too much time learning it . Then learnt photoshop for thumbnails and researched about minecraft commands, mods, datapacks,etc .Downloaded audacity and learned to use it aswell for ghost voices lol. I spent 2 months writing a script for my minecraft role play ( with npc mod) , finding suitable maps for the setting of the roleplay,setting up the minecraft mods, recording the video,editing it, making audio for the ghost and what not. All that effort turned into a cringy pile of crap which got only 50 views and most of them were my friends who were kind enough to give me a bunch of shit for making them watch so much pure cringe .\n\nNow that I was familiar with the process I made 8 more videos like this hoping they would hit the algorithm someday, None of them did. Fast forward 1 year I was more mature  but still a child . I realised minecraft roleplays wont work and made this video called \" Dantdm sings rap god\" . It was a trend at that time to pick random words from a youtuber's video and turn them into a song like Day by Dave does. Not even kidding 12 year old me made half of the rap god song using Dan's voice and it sounded perfectly fine. The sad part is that it took me 2 months to make half of it and the hitfilm video file went corrupt T\\_T. That was that for me. 2months of work all went in vain. I quit the yt thing. I dont know why I didnt back up that thing . Maybe I assumed nothing had gone wrong in hitfilm so far and became careless.\n\nLooking back at it , I still think I would have hit the algorithm hard if I managed to publish the rap god video because it was actually decent and no one had done a \" Famous celebrity sings rap god\" video at that time.",

Most of them stopped talking to me when I came out. Two weeks ago I told one of my frat brothers I was going to be in his town for work for a while...he told me he was gonna be out of town. I gave him two different dates I could be there; he told me that miraculously he was also going to be out of town on all those dates as well. Most of them won't even deign to give me a Facebook like.\n\nFuck 'em. Life is short. Take love, support, and brotherhood wherever you can find it. Don't turn away a meaningful relationship that is offered in earnest because of preconceived notions about what sorts of relationships you \"ought\" to have.",

Basically I became obsessed with all sorts of military things like the Air Force and the Navy, mainly all the vehicles they used, as I did have a lot of army toys including a bucket of toy soldiers. This mainly was because of their presence in Toy Story. Plus, a local air force base did a presentation at my elementary school all about the different vehicles they flew and different things they did. In addition, I also really enjoyed hearing war stories from grandparents. I even chose soldier as my chosen occupation for my first career day fair (basically all the kids would choose what they want to when they grow up and they would do a little science fair style project about it). \n\nHowever, despite my fascination with the military, I had absolutely no idea what the military did. If you asked four year old me what the military did, I‚Äôd probably say, ‚ÄúThey fly planes, drive tanks, and sail cool boats!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt realize that the military actually fought in wars and killed people. I think this mainly stemmed from the fact that both the presentation and my grand parents left out that aspect, which makes sense. Only now do I realize after rehearing the stories at an older age that my grandparents left out the horrors of war, including killing other people. It wasn‚Äôt until I understood what death is that I decided I wouldn‚Äôt actively plan on going into the military. Apparently it even have my parents nightmares, as they were worried I‚Äôd enlist and possibly never come back. I was only like, four but they were seriously worried I was going down that path. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I respect those who have served, and I am thankful for their actions, but between some of the more complicated immoral issues of the US military, the mental repercussions of warfare and the fact that I‚Äôd most likely have to take human life, I don‚Äôt think I could ever serve.",

My website died with my dad refusing to renew the domain in about 2006-7 lol. Bye bye obsession. \n\nI was also fairly heavily into PETA and vegetarianism as a teenager (as it's my culture) but I took the animal activism to Greta Thunberg levels, writing letters to ministers, chaining myself to trees and crying. I'm still a vegetarian, still love animals and hate cutting trees, but I'm mature about it now and don't berate other people for their life choices and don't participate in activism anymore (it takes too much out of me and frankly I don't care that much anymore).",

We wanted to be edgy, working class, urban, Brits. The fact that we could barely play any instruments apparently wasn‚Äôt a huge deterrent.

We had heard stories of artists who had at one time ‚Äúsquatted in flats,‚Äù which is like living in abandoned apartment buildings, so this was our plan! Fly to England and live like starving artists, and smoke a lot of cigarettes. Somehow, we were sure we‚Äôd be discovered just like the singer from Bow wow wow.

While they mainly just rolled their eyes, but we must‚Äôve been so obsessive and consumed by our dream that my family was at least a little concerned, because my mother later told me that my grandparents changed their living trust to make sure I wasn‚Äôt going to receive any money, should they pass way, that I could then take off with the funds and move to England and carry out my crazy plan. I guess I blew it big time because even though , thank goodness, my grandmother hung on until my late 30s, the trust never got changed back.

I'd also record every interview with Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny that I could and memorise their answers.  \nI truly thought that David Duchovny (the actor) was Mulder and that he could fall in love with me and we'd investigate paranormal things together. \nI used to etch the X-Files logo into anything I could, including a huge physics desk (the type with a Bunsen burner already installed) - I'd gotten away with the smaller ones but one day (rather than paying attention to the lesson) I etched a huge X-Files logo onto the desk - my physics teacher knew it was me (I was the only X-Files fanatic in school and made sure people knew it) and made me sand it off (it was a good one too).\nMy obsession with David Duchovny came to an end when, age 13, I had (what I'd class as) a visitation dream from him where he very kindly told me that the age gap between us was too big therefore we could never be together.  After this, it kind of gave me permission to have other interests and have boyfriends my own age. \nI did try rewatching an episode of the X-Files about a year ago (I'm now in my late 30s) and honestly thought it was awful!  I mean, the storyline was terrible and it's so dated - but Duchovny's still well fit!",

One song was so catchy that I deleted all metal related posts on my social media and decided to be basic again (what's the inoffensive version of the word?). I never really liked metal, I just went in for the image, yet I didn't even do much fashion-wise except change all my wardrobe to black. Guess what, I ended up even more dorky and regret not spending my high school days as a preppy girl. You can still be a metalhead at 25, but a preppy girl not so much.

All my new friends there are metalheads and they are elitist assholes about it. For some reason something clicked in my head and I intuitively doubled down on the whole hip hop thing - I ordered a couple of baggy pants, long tees and oversized hoodies and a pair of white Nike Air Force One '07. Had to stop short of a New Era cap since those things just don't work with my face. I'm just not a hat kinda guy. It wasn't even all that conscient of a decision. In my head it was just about me liking a certain kind of music and liking the aesthetic. When I unpacked my new clothes my mom (who payed for all of it) hesitantly asked \"so that's what you want to wear from now on?\" and I was like \"yeah, new year, new me!\".\n\nEnded up being the only kid at school who dressed like that and that phase ended shortly before I went to college. My stubbornness and tone-deafness in combination with my clique of metalheads at some point resulted in me ending up at a 3-day metal festival completely decked out in ridiculously oversized hip hop attire because I wanted to go and aside from me having literally no normal clothes that fit anymore, I didn't want to \"wear a costume\".\n\nGood times.",

I missed 1/3 of all the maths work we‚Äôre being assessed on, literally just finished that assessment. I can tell I didn‚Äôt do well. Smoking weed that much for that long while you‚Äôre in education totally fucks up everything you need to excel.

Eventually i became friends with them and quit the martial arts class.\nNice guy, very fierce, got 2 of his fingers cut and seperated by another dude in a knive fight. Dunno what he is upto now.",

In hindsight, I wasn‚Äôt. \n\nSo my pupils are absolutely huge there‚Äôs barely any colour.

Started when my best friend moved away in 6th grade, and as a way to keep in touch we'd work remotely on adapting an old cheesy superhero comic we drew in a notebook years prior (pretty standard crappy superhero trope stuff as imagined by borderline-ADHD 3rd graders). He did a lot of the editing but for the most part I was doing the writing.\n\nUnfortunately, this fun hobby between freinds ended up getting wrapped up in my need to prove to my parents, teachers, and peers that I was a clever genius kid who was gonna do great things and be famous and rich and popular one day (much longer story that probly needs professional help to unpack). So I ended up becoming 'that guy who's supposedly writing a novel but never finishes it' through much of highs school and to some extent college (though at least by then I was more well rounded and kept the novel mostly to myself and my closer friend circle). I did finish about a third of one version of the book thanks to a creative writing class in high school, bless the souls of my classmates and teacher for humoring my weekly readings of some truly cringeworthy crap.\n\nTo clarify, my downfall was that for all those years I really didn't have a full story to tell, just the barebones concept of one that I kept wrapping up in whatever Marvel/DC/anime tropes and scifi concepts happened to be popular at the time. I was also so busy constantly trying to write, that I didn't take much time to consume much new media to broaden my horizons and try to learn from actual skilled writers. Not to mention that I kept wanting to adapt my idea to a graphic novel format instead, but refused to improve my drawing skills enough to do so, lest I sully my 'magnum opus' with my first shitty attempts. So I kept waffling back and forth between formats, never satisfied and never realizing the format wasn't actually the problem.\n\nAnyways, finally gave up the ghost like two years back when I wrote enough decent chapters and worked up the courage to post weekly on a certain reddit writing forum, ended up not being able to keep up with my schedule because I realized very quickly that all the fluff I had mixed in already had me writing myself into a corner. Dropped it for a year, eventually deleted everything, and never spoke of it again. Since then I've put out a few good short stories that I'm proud of, and have recently been dabbling in pulling some usable ideas from the wreckage of my life's work, but writing has definitely taken a far backseat as far as my hobbies and interests go.\n\nMoral of the story: write because you have an interesting story to tell and genuinely enjoy writing, not because you think you gotta prove something (this applies to any artistic endeavor as well).",

I would literally howl and would walk on all fours at times and pretend I was a wolf. I had a wolf name that I tried to get my parents to call me. Fortunately I had some sense and didn‚Äôt really pull this shit in public, just at home (except maybe the howling). I still love wolves, I‚Äôve just realized that I‚Äôm indeed a human. \n\nI also went through a phase where I thought I was a ‚Äúcowboy‚Äù not a cowgirl (I am female) so anytime anyone would call me a cowgirl I would say NO! CowBOY! (Just to provide some context I did ride horses and we had cows on our farm- horse culture is weird). I was very boyish growing up so I‚Äôm sure my parents were surprised when I grew up into a straight, fairly feminine woman. Luckily my parents were very tolerant of my extreme tomboyishness and never pushed me toward typical ‚Äúgirl‚Äù stuff, they just let it sort itself out. Looking back that‚Äôs something I really appreciate. \n\nFast forward to a few years later when I discovered the band Green Day. I became obsessed with them, especially the lead singer Billie Joe. I plastered an entire wall of my room with pictures of him that I had printed off the internet. My mom would just come up and shake her head and go ‚Äúwhy do you like him so much? He wears too much eyeliner.‚Äù And I would be like mom you don‚Äôt understand he‚Äôs my SOULMATE we just haven‚Äôt met yet.\n\nAfter that came my skater wannabe phase which was pretty unremarkable, followed by my scene phase. Ugh. I never achieved full scene queen status as I was not allowed to dye my hair wild colors or buy some of the clothing required for the whole ensemble, and I am thankful now that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to ruin my hair or get snakebite piercings and such. I did make my hair as scene as possible with the deep side part and tons of teasing and hairspray. And the music. Lord. It was fun though, going to all the little local emo band concerts with my scene friends and I have a lot of good memories from that time. I listen to some of the music for nostalgia sometimes even though I can‚Äôt really stand that whiny shit lol. Nowadays I am kind of a grown up scene kid who loves metalcore and deathcore but who dresses and acts like a normal person. \n\nOne of the things I think my mom really saved me from was my toxic ass ex who I started dating when I was like 17 and continued to date for two and a half years. Everyone hated him and my family especially fought it so hard. I thought it was meant to be even though deep down I knew it wasn‚Äôt. I think they could see that. Anyway I ended up getting pregnant and my mom threatened to disown me if I had the baby because she didn‚Äôt want me to be tied to this guy for life. I know it sounds fucked up and a lot of people think I‚Äôm a horrible person because of it but I didn‚Äôt have the baby and it was hands down the best decision I ever made in my life (other than marrying my current husband which wouldn‚Äôt have happened if things didn‚Äôt unfold like they did). Me and the guy broke up, he stalked me and threatened to kill me for like 6 months (hello true colors) and then finally I moved on to live a very happy life.

            "text": "Not a phase per se, but right after graduating high school I started dating this girl that of course I fell head over heels for. I totally became a cringe romantic overnight. I thought being in a relationship was the most important thing about me, and that it would be worth going to any length to preserve it. This led to me really overcompensating for any problems that cropped up, and basically brainwashing myself into a state of absolute love and commitment that really didn't belong in my relationship and wasn't healthy. I was totally blind to the fact that I was immature, and that I could be missing out on finding someone who would actually treat me right. \n\nWhile I don't necessarily regret how I acted, (things worked out well considering how many risks I took with my education, family life, and social life) I regret doing it on full display for everyone to see what an idiot I was, and I regret being so embarrassingly in love with someone who turned out to really not be deserving of it. Even her own friends tried to warn me about her but I brushed it off. \"They don't know her like I do, she's my best friend, etc\" Turns out they knew her better and she turned out to be a cheater, a liar, and just not the person I though she was.\n\nAfter we broke up, I was absolutely heartbroken, and barely held it together. And the worst part is, I had been so overconfident that I was too embarrassed to ask for help or talk to anyone about it. I dropped 20 lbs, nearly failed some classes, and was all around in a really bad way. \n\nI didn't learn my lesson from that either, it took about 2 years of seeing her casually (even during some of her subsequent relationships) for me to realize that she was just toxic and finally block her across platforms and phase her out. \n\nThere was a noticeable and direct correlation between how much I talked to her and my health and wellbeing. I ended up having a really great final 3 semesters at college, and I have totally bloomed into a more mature and well rounded person. \n\nFrom time to time I catch myself \"missing\" her, but things were actually never as good as I thought they were back then, and that person that I fell in love with never truly existed in the way that I saw her. \n\nI think it was an important realization to come to, and it certainly opened my eyes to the nature of rose colored glasses. I'm just thankful I realized in time to make some good memories at college, and work on my personal goals.\n\nSo yeah after dating a few other girls, I can see how cringe that phase of my life must have been for the people around me. I'm now 1 semester from graduating engineering school, and I start an internship with my dream job next week! I'm excited to see the world and do something that matters, and maybe I'll meet someone on the way!",

A guy who kept flirting with me on snapchat. Would result in him sending a pic at 3am and I thought \"Nope. Either a dick pic or thirst trap.\" Never responded, never talked to him again.\n\n2. A girl who was friendly but had a crush on me that wasn't very hidden. At her parties she'd give these awkward weird flirt vibes and joked about hooking up. She'd cockblock this other girl who I was having a back and forth flirt with, and went sorta of hail mary by suggesting a 3way. Made things very weird \n\n3. Another girl who I liked and went out with for a few weeks. She didn't technically cheat. But the words technically and cheat shouldn't be that close together. She didn't want me to come to one of her plays cause she knew this other guy was gonna be there who she had been talking too recently. She hung out with him all night and lied for a while about it. Ended things a bit rudely and spread a few rumors about me to the department now.

After my mini set I would chill with my new found stage partner, have a few drinks  and pretty much inevitably hookup with him(artists chemistry!)\n\nIn an argument one night (I'd  eaten the last kitkat) my sister spat out \"you can't fucking sing you silly bitch, those lads just play BANDS with you because it's a  sure fucking thing you'll drop your knickers\"\n\nLivid, I recorded myself singing 'make yourself' by incubus on my 2 deck cassette player.
