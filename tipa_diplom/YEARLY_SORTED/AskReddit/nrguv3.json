In today's internet age, it's all too easy to forget to take a break, get out in the open and appreciate the sights and sounds of the world around us.  \nEvery country in the world has sights that deserve to be seen. The planet is unbelievably massive, and there is so much variety of landscapes it's impossible to see it all in a hundred lifetimes. All too often, these stunning views are reduced to desktop wallpapers, in turn reducing the experience of actually *being* in the world.  \nThere is a beneficial effect, too. The exercise you get from visiting new places is good for body and soul, the fresh air allows you to breathe more clearly (allergies excluded, with apologies), and the time to yourself allows you to slow down and *think* more clearly.  \n(NB: I understand getting out and about isn't always easy in the current situation, but the general advice still stands.

You can't aquire a free industry recognized certification, but you can find all of the relevant study material and just pay for the exam.\n\nThere are millions of hours of free instructor lead videos on YouTube, Udemy, and other education based video distribution sites that are objectively better led than many college courses I've sat through.\n\nThe right $200-$500 certification could lead to doubling your income, getting you out of that crap job you hate, or off the construction site, whatever, and into a forward facing career in IT, Healthcare, advertising, whatever you ACTUALLY want to do, not just whatever job you fell into out of high school.\n\nI've taken and passed around a dozen IT certs over the years, increasingly based solely on online video courses. Mostly free, some heavily discounted down to ~$10. For $200-$750 exams, netting me certifications that led to me literally tripling my income from a decade ago. And my income a decade ago wasn't total shit. \n\nNot a brag, just don't understand why more people artificially create barriers in their minds. \"I don't have the money or time for all that training.\", \"Have you seen tuition costs!?!\", \"Those jobs are for smarter people who's parents put them through college.\". \nFuck college. Fuck barriers to people that weren't born in the right zip code not just holding them back, but convincing them to hold themselves back. I've come FROM that mindset. I know how easy it is to let society trick you into thinking that the fancy, BMW driving, weekends at the beach house, vacations abroad life was never meant for people like me. Fuck that, and fuck anyone that tells you differently.\n\nIt takes work. A ton more for some than others, but it doesn't have to ALSO cost a fortune. Not to completely shit on college, there are programs like Western Governors University that are pretty awesome. With the right work ethic, time dedication, and a good study plan, people are knocking out undergrads in two six month terms (around $8K) and Masters in one! That's nothing to Masters in a year and a half for under $13K! Bonus, depending on the degree, you're also walking out with a laundry list of industry relevant certifications! Win-win.",

These points will be deducted depending on which textbook you download where most textbooks cost around 10 points each meaning you can download 10 books per account.\n\nTo receive points, you can upload a scanned pdf of a textbook and if someone downloaded your file, you receive 5 points. This means that everytime someone downloads your files twice, you get to download another book.\n\nCurrently they have over 2.5 million+ files so there is a huge chance that whatever textbook yiu are looking for is in their website.\n\nwww.twirpx.com",

There are other online quilt planners however many of them are pay per use.  In addition, an app I use frequently is by Robert Kauffman Fabrics called 'Quilting Calculator' figures out how much binding, batting, fabric you need for almost any project.  Calculates block configurations and ensures you don't screw it up BEFORE you cut your pieces.    It's free, but honestly from a quilting perspective they should have charged for it it's just that useful.",

I used the state-specific site for Florida ([https://www.fltreasurehunt.gov/](https://www.fltreasurehunt.gov/)) and found that money!

For free audiobooks, I would sign up for New York public library online (they have massive book catalogue). If you‚Äôre non-residents, they give you a card but will last for 30 days. Then download the app Libby, add your library card and you can borrow audiobooks and e-books for free! It‚Äôs a library so there are some books you have to wait for. \n\nI register a few other libraries in the US and have 3-4 cards. So I can browse when one library don‚Äôt have the book I wanted and borrow from the library that I have less people holding. If the cards expiry, I would sign up for a new one. I know it sounds like a hassle but I love reading and I can‚Äôt afford to buy a lot of books. So I‚Äôll just borrow from libraries. I would listen to the audiobook with 2x speed and read the e-book at the same time to focus on the content (i read non-fiction). So if you hear statements for example, ‚ÄúBill Gates read a book a day‚Äù. It‚Äôs possible. Hope this tips help you!",

Really wish I'd had this earlier in college, I'm terrible at taking notes, and it gets everything REALLY spot on! Very good AI, quite impressive.\n\n[Kayak](https://www.kayak.com/) is how I'm able to visit my family on the east coast of the USA this Fall. Paid less per plane ticket than any other site or service offered, and in my research it consistently beats all other prices.\n\n[Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/) is a daily use site, although entirely through the app for me. I recommend the NY Times \"The Daily\", the NPR show \"Wait Wait\", the long-form storytelling of \"Serial\", the deep-dive insanely long history lessons of \"Hardcore History\", and the Lovecraftian yet fun radio of \"Welcome to Night Vale\".\n\nFor those of you on a PC, I highly recommend adding the extension [SwiftRead](https://swiftread.com/) to your life. With this, you can read ANYTHING at significantly quicker speeds without losing comprehension. Again, this is something I wish I had found much earlier.",
