It was raw fish, raw opihi and the worst, raw eel. I had to hold my breath and not breath while eating a mouth full of raw sea weed just to feel I fit in with my company. But later, eventually, I began to love sushi and bought it in different styles from the vendors or home made myself. I could eat sushi every day. I craved it sometimes. I even turned into a sushi chef, making my own combinations with we really fun. I could use whatever ingrediences I wanted to create it such as flying fish eggs, Salmon cuts and salmon eggs, avacado, ophihi, sea weed, sauces, other marine eggs, pretty much anything that you could think up. I think a lot of foods just take time for a child to accept and develope a desire for. It‚Äôs an aquiered taste.\r  \n\r  \nMy mother would experiment with foods.

The birds react to the dark by gorging themselves on grain, usually millet seed, until they double their bulk. The birds are then thrown into a container of Armagnac, which both drowns and marinates the birds.[13] [14]\n\nThe bird is roasted for eight minutes and then plucked. The consumer then places the bird feet first into their mouth while holding onto the bird's head. The ortolan is then eaten whole, with or without the head, and the consumer spits out the larger bones. The traditional way French gourmands eat ortolans is to cover their heads and face with a large napkin or towel while consuming the bird. The purpose of the towel is debated. Some claim it is to retain the maximum aroma with the flavour as they consume the entire bird at once, others have stated \"Tradition dictates that this is to shield ‚Äì from God‚Äôs eyes ‚Äì the shame of such a decadent and disgraceful act\"",

The draining was done by hand so you had to press your palm against the chicken and flip it almost vertically so the stock drains back into the vat.  First round draining was ok because the chicken was cold so the stock came out slightly above warm, second round and third round was just fire. Reason we did it by hand was because the chicken was already cut into presentable form and using a sieve or spider would result in breaking/imprinting the skin or disturbing the presentation.

At a power breakfast at the '21' Club this morning with Craig McDermott, Alex Baxter and Charles Kennedy, I stole **a urinal cake** from the men's room when the attendant wasn't looking. **At home I covered it with a cheap chocolate syrup, froze it, then placed it in an empty Godiva box, tying a silk bow around it,** and now, in Luke, when I excuse myself to the rest room, I make my way instead to the kitchen, after I've stopped at the coatcheck to retrieve the package, and I ask our waiter to present this to the table \"in the box\" and to tell the lady seated there that Mr. Bateman called up earlier to order this especially for her. I even tell him, while opening the box, to put a flower on it, whatever, hand him a fifty. \n\nHe brings it over once a suitable amount of time has elapsed, after our plates have been removed, and I'm impressed by what a big deal he makes over it; he's even placed a silver dome over the box and Evelyn coos with delight when he lifts it off, saying \"Voi-ra,\" and she makes a move for the spoon he's laid next to her water glass (that I make sure is empty) and, turning to me, Evelyn says, \"Patrick, that's so sweet,\"\nand I nod to the waiter, smiling, and wave him away when he tries to place a spoon on my side of the table.\n\n\"Aren't you having any?\" Evelyn asks, concerned. She hovers over the chocolate-dipped urinal cake anxiously, poised. \"I adore Godiva.\" \n\n\"I'm not hungry,\" I say. \"Dinner was‚Ä¶ filling.\"\n\nShe leans down, smelling the brown oval, and, catching a scent of something (probably disinfectant), asks me, now dismayed, \"Are you‚Ä¶\nsure?\"\n\n\"No, darling,\" I say. \"I want you to eat it. There's not a lot there.\" She takes the first bite, chewing dutifully, immediately and obviously\ndisgusted, then swallows. She shudders, then makes a grimace but tries to\nsmile as she takes another tentative bite.\n\n\"How is it?\" I ask, then, urging, \"Eat it. It's not poisoned or anything.\"\n\nHer face, twisted with displeasure, manages to blanch again as if she were gagging.\n\n\"What?\" I ask, grinning. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"It's so‚Ä¶\" Her face is now one long agonized grimace mask and, shuddering, she coughs. \"‚Ä¶minty.\" But she tries to smile appreciatively, which becomes an impossibility. She reaches for my glass of water and gulps it down, desperate to rid her mouth of the taste. Then, noticing how\nworried I look, she tries to smile, this time apologetically. \"It's just\" ‚Äì she shudders again ‚Äì **\"it's just‚Ä¶ so minty.\"**\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Nl6bLgS1To",

I used to cook in bars, and on busy nights, bartenders and servers were always popping in for a second to talk shit on annoying customers and drink with us. It sounds like it would be annoying, but it was always weirdly kind of a morale boost, like no matter how shitty the customers are, we're the ones who run the place. If there was any love, it was between coworkers, not for the customers or their food. There was always plenty of hatred though, and we definitely felt that hatred while we made their food. Don't worry, I don't mean we did weird shit to the food - that is way rarer than people think - just that the charcuterie board at the table with the old rich dude and his 20 year old date was definitely not made with love, and neither was the thing you ordered, because back there we don't really know/care who gets the food once the servers take it away, so we just assume it's probably going to an asshole.",

BIG MISTAKE!!!!!!!!!! She smiled from ear to ear and said OK I'll make a special one just for you! Once she left my table she started speaking in Spanish and laughing(I then realized I was going to be in BIG TROUBLE) She brought the Burrito to me and said if it's too hot I'll take it back and tame it down a little, I smiled and said it looks delicious and she laughed and said something in Spanish again and watched as I took the first bite it tasted delicious for about 3 seconds then it felt like I had a thousand needles poking every square inch of the inside of my mouth and a mouth full of flooring wax stripper all at the same time my pores opened wide open immediately and the sweat started pouring she laughed again and said something in spanish, then she said I can take it back to the back and tame it down some if you want I tried to play it cool and ate the entire thing, I went to the semi and immediately turned off the heater and rolled the windows down and drove away, after about a day the sweating finally stopped and I thought I was home free at that point until I had to go to the bathroom It felt like I was crapping out rusty barbed wire and the same flooring wax stripper!",

So named after the Raines Law implemented during Prohibition in the United States, it's any not-intended-for-actual-eating sandwich that was used to exploit the loophole in that law.\n\nThe law put a lot of restrictions on the selling of alcohol, but allowed for hotel restaurants to serve alcohol along with a meal. One thing it didn't specify was that the customer had to eat the meal served. So along with making tiny \"hotel rooms\" using flimsy partitions, many saloons served customers alcohol along with a sandwich, and then took back and reused the same sandwich over and over again to serve alcohol to other customers. Such sandwiches would be reused for days before being replaced, and even may literally be made of rubber.\n\nIf that's not the epitome of hatred manifested as \"food\", I don't know what is.",

No one ate it except for one of the wierd teachers, it smelled like death, so the teachers started to make a joke about it.\n\nThey said you can have a sandwich bagged lunch or if you're brave enough, like Doug, you can have the Taco Loaf. \n\nDoug was a little off and I heard years later he got fired for using a homophobic slur to address the seniors. \n\nTLDR: Taco meat and Elbow macaroni with pasta sauce was a sick joke made out of hate.",

The birds are then thrown into a container of Armagnac, which both drowns and marinates the birds...... The traditional way French gourmands eat ortolans is to cover their heads and face with a large napkin or towel while consuming the bird. The purpose of the towel is debated. Some claim it is to retain the maximum aroma with the flavour as they consume the entire bird at once, others have stated \"Tradition dictates that this is to shield ‚Äì from God‚Äôs eyes ‚Äì the shame of such a decadent and disgraceful act\" and others have suggested the towel simply hides the consumers spitting out bones",

I shouldn‚Äôt say it didn‚Äôt catch on entirely because a few very choice ‚Äúguests‚Äù realized that if they were seated before 2AM we were not allowed even to hint that they should move along at any point. So many fun examples, but the best was a guys who would come in with his socially challenged friends at 1:45AM every few weeks and ask to sit at the ‚Äúspecial table‚Äù in it‚Äôs own little alcove in the basement room. In trying to make a point to his friends he would order the rack of lamb (as a second course) which had a 45 minute fire time. So one server, one bartender, and one manager until 4AM on the regular, and a pissed off cook until 2:30. It was torturous, and made so many servers ultimately quit and/or resent the owners so heartily they would end up trying to get away with whatever they could, on some occasions including theft.",

It is usually served with onions, capers, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and other seasonings, often presented to the diner separately, to be added for taste. It is often served with a raw egg yolk on top of the dish.*\n\n**The Tatars and raw meat**\n\n*A popular caricature of Mongol warriors‚Äîcalled Tatars or Tartars‚Äîhas them tenderizing meat under their saddles, then eating it raw. This story was popularized by Jean de Joinville in the 13th century. But Joinville never encountered Mongols himself and used this as a way of showing that they were uncivilized.*",

Directions as follows:\n\nIt's execution is best describe by Joanne Pritchett, who's great-great-grandmother was a cook on a St. Mary's plantation: \"Honey, every time I know I'm gonna make these here biscuits, I get myself good and mad. Normally I think about my sister-in-law, Darlene, who ran off with my husband right after Granny Pritchett's funeral. That was years ago but it still galls me into making some of the tenderist biscuits around.\n\n4 cups flour\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 1/2 teaspoon lard or solid vegetable shortening\n1 3/4 to 2 cups water\n\n\"It's very simple. I just sift the flour and salt together in a bowl. Some people, nowadays, like to use Crisco or something like that. But I believe in lard. It gives it that certain taste.\n\n\"So then, I cuts the lard into the flour with the tips of my fingers, working it real quick. During this step I make believe I'm putting out Darlene's eyes.\n\n\"Then, little by little, I pour in the cold water, until I get a good stiff dough. Put it on a real solid table with flour. Now if your table is week, honey the legs'll fall right off. I've seen it happen!\n\n\"Depending on my mood, I use an ax or a big ole mallet. I make a ball out of the dough to look like Darlene's head and, baby, I let her have it. Use the flat side of the ax or mallet, and beat the hell out of the dough till it blisters good. Takes about half an hour, but honey, it makes 'em tender as butter.\n\n\"Form the dough into balls, the size of little eggs, and flatten them on the board. Put a few pokes in the center with a fork, then bake in a hot 425¬∞ oven for about 20 to 25 minutes. Serve hot and put some liniment on your arm, or it'll be acting up the next day.\"",

After persuading Philomela to come with him to pay her sister a visit, he locked her in a secluded, guarded hut, and raped her repeatedly.  \nAfraid she might tell someone, he cut out her tongue. Philomela found a way to alert her sister by weaving a story-telling tapestry. Procne rescued her sister and, after seeing her, she decided on the best way to get revenge (and prevent the line of abusers from continuing).  \nShe killed her son, Itys, and served him to her husband at a special feast just for him.

            "text": "TLDR: I make delicious peach cobblers out of spite and pettiness. \n\n\nSo when we were getting married, my fianc√© and I were talking to the caterers in the morning about the menu.  White gloved servicemen were to pass around different appetizers that we selected together during cocktail hour. Then for the reception, there was a salad course, and for main course guests got to chose either prime rib or flounder filet.  The caterers also told us to pick a dessert. My fianc√© and I chose peach cobbler (wedding was in GA... so peaches sounded good). \n\nWell my fianc√© went to work, and while he was gone the caterers called me and said usually they don‚Äôt do desserts at weddings because there‚Äôs usually a wedding cake. They hadn‚Äôt meant for us to pick one. They could still do it, but said it was unusual. I told them no prob,  just nix the peach cobbler then. Everything else was the same as what me and my fianc√© decided together that morning. \n\nLater that evening my fianc√© and I went over to his dad‚Äôs house. His father has always been a little mean to me. He always tells everyone how much he loves me and thinks I‚Äôm the best DIL , but then sometimes makes snide comments about how ‚Äúwomen always have to have their way.‚Äù whenever I make a decision.  Even though I don‚Äôt ever bully my husband into doing only what I want... \n\nWell my fianc√© was telling his father about all the food we had decided on for the wedding. When he got to the end he said excitedly ‚Äúand peach cobbler for dessert!‚Äù  I had forgotten to tell them that that had been cancelled while he was at work. So I said ‚ÄúOh sorry, actually that‚Äôs not happening. We‚Äôre just doing wedding cake instead.‚Äù \n\nHis father started pointing and laughing and made a huge deal that ‚Äúwomen are always right, kiddo! You don‚Äôt even get peach cobbler at your wedding if she doesn‚Äôt want it! Happy wife happy life!‚Äù \n\n... it was the one decision made without his input, and I thought it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. My fianc√© didn‚Äôt even care. He‚Äôs not a huge fan of cobbler, and also understood that there would be wedding cake (which he chose the flavor of).\n\nThe teasing by FIL increasingly felt a little mean spirited because he continued to bring up this peach cobbler, saying every time ‚Äúyou know women always get to make the decisions kiddo. Remember how you don‚Äôt even get peach cobbler.‚Äù\n\nHe even *brought one to the reception* and gave it to my husband while telling everyone the story of how I ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt let him have peach cobbler so he brought it for him.‚Äù  Damn, I would‚Äôve let my fianc√© have one from the caterers , he just didn‚Äôt really even want one! \n\n\n\n\n\nWell,  I am a wonderful baker and cook. It‚Äôs one of my passions. I spent so much time *perfecting* the recipe for the best damn peach cobbler anyone has ever had. And now I make that and bring it to my father-in-law‚Äôs house *every single time* he invites us over.  Since he wanted a damn peach cobbler so bad, I will never let a BBQ go without one.   (Also my husband really does sort of like peach cobbler. He doesn‚Äôt care that they‚Äôre made out of pettiness).",

There my companions and I continually ate a lot of fatty food, the couple always made something fried or frozen, the breakfast was too abundant for our Italian stomach and at least 2 times a week they had a barbecue. They cooked some very good German food, but for overseas food... oh god.  Since we were Italians, the couple thought it was nice to cook some pizza. Pity that what they served us could not be defined as pizza: it was a white \"pizza\" (without tomato sauce) with fennel (or something like that, you couldn't understand it from the look or taste) cheese that didn't look like mozzarella, was crushed making it almost as thick as a sheet of paper and finally it was frozen and heated in the oven. The couple had taken it perhaps to make us feel a bit at home, so they hadn't done it with hatred. Rather, the guy from the German frozen pizza company had done it with hate",

She has operated the restaurant since 1980; before that time, it was owned by her great-uncle, Thornton Prince III. Although impossible to verify, Jeffries says the development of hot chicken was an accident. Her great-uncle Thornton was purportedly a womanizer, and after a particularly late night out his girlfriend at the time cooked him a fried chicken breakfast with extra pepper as revenge. Instead, Thornton decided he liked it so much that, by the mid-1930s, he and his brothers had created their own recipe and opened the BBQ Chicken Shack caf√©.",

They were merciful enough to give you a good helping of fries if you got the cheese, though. But no veggies.

Although impossible to verify, Jeffries says the development of hot chicken was an accident. Her great-uncle Thornton was purportedly a womanizer, and after a particularly late night out his girlfriend at the time cooked him a fried chicken breakfast with extra pepper as revenge. Instead, Thornton decided he liked it so much that, by the mid-1930s, he and his brothers had created their own recipe and opened the BBQ Chicken Shack caf√© (from Wikipedia)",

It's a disciplinary foodstuff, designed to technically satisfy the requirement that prisoners be fed, but make it as unpleasant a process as they can legally get away with. \n\n\nFrom [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutraloaf): \n\n> Nutraloaf is a food served in prisons in the United States and formerly Canada to inmates who have misbehaved, for example by assaulting prison guards or fellow prisoners. It is similar to meatloaf in texture, but has a wider variety of ingredients. Prison loaf is usually bland, perhaps even unpleasant, but prison wardens argue that nutraloaf provides enough nutrition to keep prisoners healthy without requiring utensils to be issued.\n\n> The standards of the American Correctional Association, which accredits prisons, discourage the use of food as a disciplinary measure, but adherence to the organization's food standards is voluntary. Denying inmates food as punishment has been found to be unconstitutional by the courts, but because the loaf is generally nutritionally complete, it is sometimes justified as a \"dietary adjustment\" rather than a denial of proper meals.\n\n>  The Vermont Supreme Court held that the nutraloaf and water diet constitutes punishment as it was designed to be unappetizing and as such compelled its conclusion.",
