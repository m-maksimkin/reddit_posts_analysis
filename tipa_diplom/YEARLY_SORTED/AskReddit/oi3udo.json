Sorting comments by controversial there are at least 2 others that mention using the correct pronouns for people. In my head I'd pictured the more narrow-minded people of the sub to be a loud minority, and while the karma shows that they are outnumbered by open-minded people, it's still a wake up call. If this is the response the sub has to trans rights, I'm not sure if I want to stay on it. Thank you to the people that did upvote this, you're the diamonds in the rough.",

I have an uncle who changed his name and it has nothing to do with gender - he just didn't like the name he was given at birth and changed it to another name in adulthood. And the whole family still says shit like \"aw, well you'll always be *Bob* to me. I can call you that because we grew up together. I just have such a hard time remembering.\" despite the fact he changed it well over a decade ago and expresses clearly to everyone how much he hates being called his birth name.\n\nBasic decency is referring to people in the way that is right *for them*.\n\nAnd it's okay to fuck up sometimes... But do it gracefully and don't leave the other person responsible for absolving you of your discomfort. Just apologize/correct and move on: \"Where is he going.... Oops, she.

Not knowing someone is RIGHT behind you and therefore swinging the door open like a damn maniac, or forcefully closing it right away, is a lack of spatial awareness and shit behavior. Taking just a second to check if someone is directly behind you, or on the other side of the door, is basic human decency. Giving people enough space in a checkout lane in case they suddenly have to back out is also basic human decency. And ffs, if you do realize you forgot something and decide to back up, LOOK before you do so. I always give people at least 8 feet. Even pre-covid. I get some remarks like \"move forward already\", but I can't tell you how many times the person in front of me has suddenly backed out and STILL damn near ran into me had I not put my arm out to stop them. If I was a spike I would have impaled several people by now, and that's WITH giving them ample space. People do not look and they do not, at any given time, know how many people are within 20 feet of them and where those people are directional-wise. I always do. Always. I've actually seriously considered teaching spatial awareness classes, as i do not know anyone who has spatial awareness to the degree I do. I can confidently say I am an expert in it. And no, I have no military background. My skill comes from anxiety, sadly.\n\nNot only is spatial awareness basic human decency, it may very well save your life one day. Learn it.",

I stepped in (I'm 5\"08 so not very imposing, but I tried to make myself as big as possible) and told him to fuck off, which lead to a discussion in which he tried to insult my intelligence, height and the fact that I dared to bother him. I didn't let it faze me and he got the message and left after a while. \n\n\n\nThe group the girl was in (4 people) was super grateful and told me how kind they thought I was and I was just stunned, cause this shouldn't be considered kindness, it should be completely normal. I hung out with their group a bit and got them some water while I also calmed down a bit. Later a guy standing a few feet beside us asked if we knew this guy and while he was disapproving of his behaviour after we told him that we didn't know the creep it was odd to me that he didn't step in at all, even though he was closer to them that me before the escalation and would probably have been met with a bit more respect \n\n\n\nIf you see something, say something.",

Why wouldn't he take care of our kid??\n\nEdit: a lot of butthurt comments/PMs.  It sounds like they don't understand the question/response I gave or maybe they are one of the dads that aren't there for their kids. The question was what is considered a kindness but actually human decency.  Some people consider a dad being there for their kids as a kindness, that those dads are doing something more than they needed - as if their only part was contributing half the DNA and anything else is extra and absolutely unnecessary.  Really, it's them doing their part, which I consider a human decency. My husband and I are equals. We both have done the diapers, taking our kid to doc appointments, etc. Goodness, prepandemic days, we did most of our grocery shopping all together as a family. Even then, I'd get comments of what a good father my husband is for even coming to the store. As some replies stated, one of the reasons strangers are so wowed by this because they themselves have not had great fathers/husbands doing their part, which is unfortunate. Even worse, we'd get older men commenting saying they feel bad that my husband was \"dragged\" along. A dad being there for their child is not going above and beyond and deserving of some sort of Nobel Peace prize or something. A dad simply taking care of their child is the bare minimum. I'm sorry for those of you that don't/didn't have that. I recognize there are a lot of relationships that don't work out, sometimes because of the lack of effort from one side.  To the moms and dads that are out there trying their absolute best: keep up the great work. If you have a spouse that seems to be less than there for your kid, please communicate with each other with your needs. Both moms and dads need a break sometimes to do shopping on their own.",

I saw a person stuck in the middle of the alleyway sitting in their mobile scooter and someone else bending over working on the wheel. I walked over asking if they needed help. \n\nWhat was I gonna do? Well I thought I could push at least. They asked for a scissors to see if removing the debris would get it to move. I had a pocket knife. We figured it wasn't the wheel had to be the the battery. At that point someone pulled into the alleyway and another guy walked up. He asked what happened, I told him we guess it's the battery. He started messing with the cables. Then the mobile scooter mans family pull up with a wheelchair. We couldn't help with the scooter but the man who pulled up originally started to place the scooter into two pieces making it easier to place in a car.. We  did that for them.. They thanked us profusely. I got my knife back and the volunteers all shaked hands I even thank them for stopping because I was basically useless. One thing I got from that experience is you may not always be the one that really helps but your assistance is always appreciated and needed. Plus. I like to think the other people stopped because they saw strangers helping one person out. \n\nTip, always ask if they need help. that way you don't come off like a weirdo and the time of covid. I've been told no before and that is okay. I know what is like to be independent. The ones who really need it will say yes and appreciate more.",

She did that while being extremely busy and having a lot going on and she keeps coming back so I just accepted that and hope it gets better cuz I wanna give her a chance.

It was a huge operation and employed about 150 men. Anyway we were working for the 2nd largest coal company in America, great pay, excellent benefits, great retirement. In the winter months it was brutal trying to keep everything running, water pumps, holding tanks, etc. We were working on a pump that was froze up and he slipped and hit his ribcage hard on the pump. He took a couple days off, but it just kept getting worse,  black and green, swelling sore, turns out he had liver cancer, like end stage cancer. They tried aggressively to treat him and he was sick. He was on short term leave and was getting like 75% of his salary, in order to get that you had to work a certain amount time or go on long term which was just a fucking joke. He came back to try to work for a while to go back on short term and it was pitiful to see him like that, he had just built a beautiful home for his family and a kid in college, so I knew what he was doing. We all pulled together so he could be as comfortable as possible while at work, well upper management found out and gave him the opportunity to resign or be terminated. He died a short time later and his insurance policy took care of everything. It shows what a big company really thinks of its employees, I understand that the company is in business to make money, but this man's life revolved around that company. Myself I changed jobs to a smaller more family oriented company and have never been happier, I guess as long as you don't get sick, you're worth keeping but if you do, try to have your shit together, life insurance and so forth.

This is the core meaning behind history's greatest moral precepts, from the golden rule to the categorical imperative.

However it can be difficult to uphold when we have been subjected to the indignity of its violation. But our own suffering is not to be used as a reason to not extend the principle of basic human decency to others--it is in fact a reason to uphold it. The failure to grasp this logic is key to understanding the status of basic human decency in today's (or any) society. The simple truth is that suffering is an inevitable part of life.

Only a few people have gone through and cleared out their voicemail box so that they can receive more voicemails. It took me 1 1/2 hours to do it because there were 280+ voicemails in the system going back 2 years. Two other people in my office still haven't done it and still won't receive and therefore won't reply to voicemails.\n\nI've been doing very well in my new job and I would say at least 40% of the praise I get is just because if someone e-mails me and I don't know the answer, I will explain \"I'm sorry I don't know the answer off hand and it will take a bit of time to get the information together so I'll have to get back to you with the right answer on that\". Apparently other people just leave the e-mail unread until they've had time to figure things out then they reply. A lot of the complaints co workers get is just based on a lack of communication.\n\nSo yeah... if you want to look good at work, just reply to people. Don't even need to give them an answer or a time frame, just assurances that you're looking into it. And don't automate the replies either, people know when they're talking to a robot.",

Blocking someone when they are trying to merge holds up traffic and more importantly, is super distracting for the person trying to change lanes. Accidents happen when people are distracted. \n\nLame changes are already the most dangerous part of driving. Don‚Äôt put yourself and other people in danger so you can save 0.00002 seconds of time. \n\nBy the same token, you should avoid passing other drivers unless there‚Äôs a legitimate reason. Stuff like being stuck behind a large vehicle or someone going 20mph under the speed limit are good reasons to go ahead and pass. But I have people pass me all the time when I‚Äôm going 10mph above the speed limit. Again, lane changes are the most dangerous part of driving. Don‚Äôt put both of us in danger to save exactly 0 minutes of your time. It‚Äôs not worth it!\n\nHowever, you also need to be aware of who has the right-of-way. It‚Äôs really important that you don‚Äôt give up your right-of-way to be ‚Äúnice‚Äù. It seems nice but it‚Äôs dangerous. Right-of-way laws were established to provide consistency to driving scenarios that would otherwise be totally random.

Politeness can definitely be done out of kindness, but perhaps it's not mean to be understood as kindness in most scenarios unless done excessively which would make it more obvious. Kindness from being overly polite seems like something a shy person would attempt. I think being polite normally won't cause confusion about whether it's done out of kindness or not, unless the situation pertains to culture shock or if it's done excessively.\n\nPoliteness comes from the heart for respecting the importance of politeness. Similar to the idea of having the heart to care for your belongings, dedicating the time and energy to do your work, etc..\n\nSame goes for having the heart to do your job in the service industry properly which would be the sense of professionalism. But when one's job is literally to be kind, it makes it a lot harder to tell if the person is genuinely kind or not (like this person could be an ass after clocking out). So I think it's more common to perceive people in customer service to be kind more than casual politeness and basic decency.",

Youvsee someone behind you, you hold the door instead of close it in their face. Someone comes up at the same time, you offer them to go ahead instead of huff and puff and be a jerk.

It's one thing for the guy who I offered my seat to to say \"thank you\" but for passengers to react the way they did really rubbed me the wrong way. It was not worthy of the scene it created.\n\nWhat annoyed me even further, is that I posted about it on Facebook later that day when I got home and a bunch of my Facebook friends did the same fucking thing despite me explaining that what I did should be normal, barely even worth commenting on. Yet they too were praising me as if I'd done something unexpected and wonderful instead of something totally boring and normal.\n\nThe whole experience was just another blemish on my hope for humanity.
