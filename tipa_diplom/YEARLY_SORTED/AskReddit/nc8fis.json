To me that gives me the idea that they are being a bit over the top and most likely rude to others because of the bad day they are having. If the post had read something along the lines of \"taking their phones out and recording a tragic accident\" my response would obviously be a completely different one.",

She came out and took a ton of pictures. I’m not sure if she filmed, and I never heard about her posting but I don’t know that I would have. \n\nMy mom has literally over a million dollars in medical bills. She had to sue the guy who caused the accident to get anything more than a few thousand dollars from his insurance. The pictures that woman took have been entered into evidence. 5 years later and the case isn’t over yet, but there’s no way those pictures aren’t going to help.

If someone is seriously hurt and needs evidence for the police then I want to be able to help.\n\nTwice I’ve been able to show the police that showed up for domestic fights that it was the woman that was the aggressor. One of them, she had grabbed her bf’s phone and chucked it god knows where, so he had no evidence that he had been trying to deescalate the situation. She was slapping and kicking him and all he was doing was trying to cover his face. Cops show up and she’s crying how he’s abusing her, hitting her, etc. I come out and I’m like “That’s not at all what happened.” With my video. They uncuff him and let him go. Glad the cops were there because she looked like she would have turned on me if they hadn’t been. She was PISSED.\n\nHope he ended up leaving her for good.\n\nEdit: I got in the habit of filming fights after I had been walking my pup late at night. Man and woman were fighting beside their car with their infant inside. Out of nowhere, the man grabs the woman’s head and SLAMS it against the car window, she’s dazed and trying to get off the ground and he jumps in the car and peels out with their baby. It happened so quick I had no time to react and no video to give her if she wanted to press charges/have evidence for custody fights. I think about her often, actually. I hope her and the baby are ok.\n\nEdit 2: lol before anyone asks why I live somewhere with so many fights.. I live in Brooklyn. A really safe part too. But stick a few million people together and there’s gonna be plenty of conflict.",

When they pass by campus, the college students walking or hanging out will all start videoing the bus filled with kids. She said it's like being famous without being famous. The bus starts getting close to campus & all the college students start holding their phones up. Evidently it's just something random they post on social media. Snap chat, tiktok.. Whatever, but one of the teachers showed her a post of a college student who posted a video of them in the school bus & it was titled something like \"I remember riding in one of these\"...

We were the family that cried wolf for most of this year, literally getting no response from property management or police when my 5 year old found a dimebag of crack in front of their unit door, but shit started closing in on them when I got two HD cameras for the back and front yard, and made a habit out of recording every time I leave the building. \n\nThe star of this story has been the girlfriend, who soured the neighborly relationship when she once came down the street at midnight yelling that I'm a bad neighbor because I didn't bring her garbage can in two days after pickup, which I admit I was reticent to do at the start of COVID given the only job either of them holds aside from \"crackwhore\" is the dumpster diving her boyfriend does for a living, stealing from Salvation Army donation bins and the like.\n \nShe is a master at gaslighting, so recently my property managers received a call from her about me coming outside and saying \"what's that?\" before starting an altercation between the two of us after months of everyone being told not to contact each other. However, because I know she is a fucking liar, I am always recording, and before I say \"what's that?\" she is clearly on tape making a shitty comment about my kids, hence the altercation. \n\nUntil I showed them definitive proof that she was the one starting shit, they had thought I was the asshole provoking the drug dealers to get a rise so I could push them out. The reality, as they're all forced now to confront, is that she's exactly what I've described her to be: a literal crackwhore who has harassed and assaulted us for a year, threatened on tape to bash my head in with a shovel, call child services on my kids, tried to poison my dog, and... *kisses fingers* beat the shit out of her boyfriend right on the front lawn in full view of my dope ass camera, resulting in an assault charge and two subsequent arrests for returning to the property. \n\nAll of her bad days were once our burden, and because I started filming them, she'll never be allowed back and they're going to be evicted as soon as possible.

The entitled customer, although annoying and usually straight up rude, I can handle, but pulling out the phone pisses off the customer (which I can understand), and than the asshat stands by watching like a hungry dog *hoping* it gets worse.

I stood up to get out of the way, and found there was this fucker (looked like a college student, accompanied by some girl of the same age) standing there not 10 feet away with a videocamera and a smile, filming this with great intensity, like it was the most exciting shit he'd ever seen.\n\nI stood up to face him. \"WTF is wrong with you?\"\n\n<The camera turned to me now, his smile got even bigger.

Out of 50 or more people on the street that day only 1 person called 999. More than 20 people lined the road to film and gawk instead of help. I was a little sick of humanity that day.",

One evening last year he had one of those and I had to perform CPR. I obviously simultaneously called an ambulance and they came shortly after, leaving the lights on because they had to park in the middle of the street.\n\nNow after a seizure, my fiancé is very disoriented. He doesn't know where he is, who he is, who anyone else is, it sometimes differs, but it's always bad. On this particular day, he remembered me and took to me for help in his confusion. He couldn't fell his legs, he didn't know what was happening, he didn't realize he only hat his underpants on (we had gone to sleep about an hour before and it was a very hot day). He was bleeding from his mouth because he had bitten a tiny bit of his tongue off and his chest was red from me hitting it during CPR. He looked awful. \n\nWhen the paramedics and I helped him outside to bring him to the ambulance, he wasn't able to put any clothes on due to his disorientation and would shrug any blanket off because it was too hot.\n\nThe neighbour, alerted by the siren and lights of the ambulance, was standing outside his house, beer in hand, filming us. I helped put my fiancé into the ambulance and went to grab a bag of stuff for the hospital. My fiancé cried out for me like a lost child since I was the only person he recognised. It was heartbreaking. And my asshole of a neighbour filmed it all while laughing his drunken ass off. I went over, yelled at him in very explicit language and demanded he delete the video. He just laughed at me. \n\nWell, joke was on him. I called the cops and they took the phone. He got to pay a fine for filming a person without permission (illegal in Germany) and has now orders to stay away from us. \n\nI still wonder what he thought while doing this.

I always wanted to just slap the stupid fucking look on her face when she found pleasure in someone else’s misfortune. She always has to know everyone’s business, offers this world nothing",

We all had the same amount of leg room, and I would never jam my knees in someone's chair like that. \n\nRather than bringing the conflict about directly with that woman, I called a flight attendant and asked to be moved. She said not to worry about it, just to remain in my seat.\n\nSo, internally annoyed, having to sit awkwardly to avoid feeling the woman's knees behind me, I prepared for a long uncomfortable flight. The woman behind me had said something to the flight attendant that was rude. She started yelling. So, I started recording. (The woman behind me could not see my camera.) Fighting about wearing a mask.\n\nIt felt like it was taking forever to taxi to the runway, and the entire plane was emptied except for that woman. Once we were off the plane, cops went in and escorted that woman off.

            "text": "I’d personally like to know myself\n\nSo, through uni I’ve been working as a bus operator for my city’s transit. Since I was a newer op, I usually got later pick at signup and got stuck with the middle/high school keys (shifts) in the suburbs of the city. For just under a month, I decided to keep consistent and choose the same sign up, a high school route in some upper middle class suburbs in the north of the city. Most of the kids liked me because I wasn’t far from their age, but there were always bad apples.\n\nOne day, the two “bad apples” decided it would be funny to pull a joke on me. A joke in the likes of throwing juice at me while the other recorded. In response to him throwing juice at me, I threw him out of the bus. I call that a 1 for 1. Other kid took the massage and put his phone away and sat down while I was driving away from his now ill-fated friend. Seemed badass in my head at the time but once I had finished my post trip check and changed my pants, I decided to go see my union rep and get an assault form. He did his thing, police showed, they did their thing, footage was downloaded from the bus, nothing new, I’ve had my fair share of that.\n\nNext day on the same key, I pulled up to a rather pissed off mom, who funny enough, was also filming, and trying to start an uproar with me about how she had to drive her son to school that day. Decided to say nothing to provoke her, and just left as usual, picked up the other stops, yadada. Apparently, my rep was having a good day yesterday, because I arrived at the school with the Resource Officer and one of the Assistant Principals waiting at the shelter. He put up his hood and snuck up to the rear door, so I didn’t unlock it and just told kids to get out of the front. Kid must not have been the sharpest either, because he asked me why the rear door wouldn’t open when the green light was off.\n\nDidn’t see the video pop up in the news, so I was glad there, but it made me paranoid for a bit, so I dropped that key and just went back to driving whatever was closest to me on the signup shelf. Glad I didn’t lose my job over people like that.",

As I got closer, there was another customer still following close and the guy in the truck still following but from a distance.

I continued to follow him down the street from a distance and decided to try and go around building and catch up with him on the other side. One thing I didn't think of was the possibility of an accomplice. as I'm coming up to the other side of the building someone drive up to me and starts yelling at me asking who I am and why I'm being a good Samaritan since the goods \"are insured!\" anyways and if I don't stop recording her she was going to shoot me.

One day, a dad came in after class and refused to leave. The mom and baby were already outside and he started asking us about cleanliness and wellness at the gym. Normal - we got those questions all the time. This continued for a few minutes and the other teacher and I quickly realized something was not right. The mom tried to get him to come out, again, and mentioned to me that he had been out drinking while she and the baby were in the class (on a Sunday morning, btw). \n\nThe dad started going off about “Have you ever heard of the deadly influenza? Polio?” Over and over again. He started accusing us of endangering his infant, who had missed the prior week’s class due to a cold. He told us it was our fault, kept yelling about influenza, and raising his voice. At that point, a dad and his two kids had come in for the next class and the first dad started telling him not to trust us. Dad #2 was clearly uncomfortable and took his kids back to the car. We started asking the first dad to go ahead and meet up with his family at the car because our next class was coming and non-class members are not allowed to merely hang out and watch (honestly that’s creepy). \n\nAt this point, he was getting louder and more aggressive with his speech, while kids and parents were coming in for the next class. It was actually scaring all of the 4/5 year olds, a lot. At this point, we told him he is now trespassing and we could call the authorities if he continues to linger and harass. He left, yelling. We saw his wife try to get him into the car and heard him yelling at her and pushing her away. We were scared for his family. I called the police when I saw him coming back after he got away from his wife. After the call, he seemed to be yelling at me the most, since the other teacher had started to try beginning the class to distract the kids. I, a 4’11” female, got him to argue with me outside, successfully coaxing him into further argument so that he would follow me out of the building and away from the children (who are now crying). \n\nThis is the point where he pulls out his flip phone (lol) and starts recording me, yelling about how he will use this video to show the authorities how I endanger children and berate people. I said “Go ahead, sir, let them see how calm I am and how toxic you are being.” \n\nHis wife finally got him in the car and they left just moments before the police arrived. \n\nBy time we got in the next morning, there was a message on the machine from the wife, canceling her membership. The next day, my boss came in and yelled at me. “You are NEVER EVER supposed to leave the floor during a class! You are always supposed to be ‘on!’” Yeah, ok lady, let’s just endanger all of the kids because you think I need to be ‘on’ like a party princess 24/7. I quit not long after.",

A 1min and 10min response time will be the difference between if the person choking is brain dead or not it only take 4 - 5 min to go brain dead from strangulation. \n\n\n\nThis actually reminded me of when I was a recreational attendent. \n\nMy job was to watch the facility and people mainly kids aswel as maintain the facility. \n\nThe facility had a skate park a arena for ice skating and rec facility with two gymnasiums and a stage. Be all means it wasn't a small place so several coworkers would watch other areas like the skatepark. \n\nAnyways, one day I'm in the rec building and I look outside and see a circle of kids and teens. My first thought was\n\n \"oh shit there's a fight going on\" \n\nSo I run out there to stop it, when I got there I realized one of the teens came down from a jump on his bmx hard and it slipped out from under him leaving him to land elbow first into the pavement breaking it in several places. \n\nI knew this because of the way he was laying and his arm was bleeding through his clothes and the pavement is to slick to scape against so I knew there was a break and it punctured the skin. \n\nDo you know what is friends were doing? \n\nNothing, they just filmed him laying there. \nNot a single person went to go get help, call and ambulance check if he's ok or even try to make him feel comfortable until I got there and immediately started pointing and giving people tasks to assist me in first aid. I should also mention this was in a remote community so I was expecting at least a 20min to 30min response time from the nearest ambulance. \n\nAll I could really do was stop the bleeding, splint the injury and make him calm and comfortable. So I layed down beside him and we watched family guy untill the ambulance arrived. \n\nAfter it was all said and done I asked one of the teens \"why didn't you get help?\" and the few there pretty much all come to the same conclusion. They assumed someone was already on the way. \n\nI guess it's lucky I was looking out the window and watching a area my coworker was supposed to because who knows how long he would've been there for before help arrived.",

I don’t record people on my phone but sometimes use small tiles in my shirt-pockets designed to be placed beneath a table to capture audio surreptitiously.

I never share, exploit or plagiarize the contents of these recordings but try to determine what kind of feeling it evokes, how it evokes it, and then find an analogous, fictional correlate. I do this by thinking of more increasingly extreme correlates, each isolating one factor of the one before until the content of the original recording is invisible.\n\nSince I take people’s privacy seriously, I’ll use a fabricated recording and a fictional rendering as an example:\n\nRecording: “What are you doing? Playing!? I live here; we lived here; this is my yard! This isn’t a jungle gym. This was my wife’s garden” he breaks into tears.\n\nIdea for fiction: A close friend and follower of a prominent activist and proponent of non-violence leaves loaded weapons around a community erected statue of his friend.\n\nAs you can see, there are enough leaps between analogies that they aren’t really related from recording to idea at all, but I find it useful.",

I saw a video once of a woman shopping at Target and the guy was being a creep to her so she left the store. Then a few weeks or months she saw him again at Target and recognized him so she started recording discreetly then when she asked the guy if he was the one creeping on women, he recognized her and ran away. \n\nOr I also saw a girl that filmed a guy following her from the subway train and then she turned away and told him to f off and stop following her. The guy had probably a mental disability though so I'm not gonna judge on that one.   \n\n\nBut most people don't record on videos for things like that. They provoke people until they explode and then accuse them of being nasty.",

My lungs had essentially exploded and were filling with blood, so I couldn't breathe and was letting out a continuous, painful moan that comes with a collapsed lung. I remember not being able to inhale despite how much I desperately tried. At that moment, I accepted that I was probably going to die, and everything started going grey. My boyfriend who was riding behind me came up and said my eyes were huge, which is a characteristic sign of a person on the verge of death. Then I suddenly was able to take a breath, and thankfully another motorist had stopped to help. As I became more aware of my surroundings, I realized \\*multiple\\* motorists had stopped on this thin, winding road, many of them coming to crowd around me to try and be a hero or to just...**watch**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome asshole was recording me narrating his version of events for views on whatever shitty social media site he was on. Some other lady claimed she was a nurse and that we should remove my helmet, which is absolutely the last thing you should do in this situation (it was actually kind of funny later because 3 other people there at the time simultaneously yelled \"NO!\"). Another motorist, I assume out of frustration from being caught in a mild traffic jam, sped past in his minivan with his tire coming inches from my head. Another random guy came up to my traumatized boyfriend and told him \"God saved your girlfriend today, son\" which is admittingly the most benign and well-meaning of these encounters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the time I was just thinking of surviving and trying to comfort my bf, but later on, I realized how animalistic these people were. Its a tough thing for me to see now, people's lives slipping away while people jam their phones in their faces.

I try to edge by but there isn't enough room.  Roll down my window and she starts \"do you know how fast you were going around the corner there are kids here why are you speeding\" and I simply reply \"the speed limit is 50kmph, I was going about 30 around the corner\" - she gets louder about how no I wasn't going 30 and the speed limit is 30 (Speed limit is 50, I was right, checked after this incident anyway) and I was going 50 yatta yatta.  I get annoyed when she is refusing to move and say \"just move your car you cunt!\" and her jaw drops and she moves her car and I go home at the end of the street.   \n\nWhile I am getting out of my car, I notice her parking on the street and walking onto my property while filming me.  She then says \"WHAT DID YOU CALL ME BACK THERE WHY DOTN YOU TELL THE CAMERA WHAT YOU CALLED ME BACK THERE\"  And I simply said \"You mean when I called you a dumb cunt for blocking traffic, lying about my speed, being incorrect about the speed limit and causing issues for no reason\" turned around, and went inside my house.\n\nNever heard anything again, or have ever seen her again.  I thought it was hilarious, she thought she had some 'gotcha' on me, and I couldn't have cared less about that cunt.",

For some reason they drove her back to the dorm parking lot and shoved her out of the car. She didn’t tell anyone, stopped going to class got dropped by her sorority and started drinking heavily. She had a psychotic break and eventually got out in rehab where she opened up about the incident to a select few people but had a very hard time talking about it. \n\nShe was obviously still in a lot of pain. She relapsed and got hammered at a college football tailgate party. The cops arrested her for public and underage intox. She told me later that when she’d gotten so wasted she didn’t even know where she was or what was going on when the cops initially detained her. She said she immediately went back to being held down by that group of men that repeatedly raped her for days. She started sobbing and screaming, “Don’t fucking touch me! Get the fuck off me! No! Stop!” At some point she realizes what’s happening and the fear terror morphs to rage. She starts screaming stuff like, “Where were you? Where the fuck were you when they raped me?” Some evil, miserable mom tailgating with her college age kids filmed the whole thing and posted it everywhere. \n\nWhen I was presented the video, I hadn’t heard the full story. I declined to view it out of respect, thinking it was just her being arrested but when I overheard the audio I just started crying and laid into every single girl gawking at it, demanding they shut it off. It was truly harrowing. The comments were disgusting. I tracked down the lady that posted the video and desperately tried reasoning with her but she thought it was hilarious and that this girl was a slutty, sinful, brat getting what she deserved. This appalled me so I went to bat for her in the public comments and I got eaten alive. The general consensus of a community like that being she was either crying rape to get off the hook or essentially that she should be shamed for choosing to get so irresponsibly drunk and choosing to have a flashback in public. This still makes my stomach churn. She was basically a kid that had experienced horrific trauma. She needed help not a record and ridicule. She wasn’t hurting anyone she was literally crying for help after being terribly abused and failed by the system. \n\nThat being said... you should always assume you’re on camera. Maybe if someone filmed the man abducting my friend he would have been caught before getting the chance to torture her for days. You shouldn’t be upset about being held accountable for your actions, good day or not. There’s no excuse for being racist or throwing a temper tantrum and there’s no excuse for being a sick and posting videos of people in distress that aren’t hurting anyone. Our cameras should be used to help protect ourselves and each other and not to bully people.",

A woman at a table right behind me had one of the worst seizures I've ever seen. People didn't have cell phones with cameras at that time but people did still gawk exactly the same as they do now and as a kid I did exactly the same. About 10 seconds in some super hero guy comes flying across the tables and catches her right before her head hit the floor. He looked up at everyone and yelled at the top of his lungs in full panic something along the lines of \"what the Fuck is wrong with you people, somebody help her!\" I knew he wasn't directing it at me, but for some reason I couldn't help but feel at fault because I was more curious as to what was happening rather than caring for the person it was happen to. It's really stuck with me over the years to the point now where when I'm witnessing something that could be considered 'recordable' the only words going through my head are \"you have to try and help them\". Most of the time that means not gawking and trying to help if I can, and sometimes the way I can help is not pulling it my phone and trying to record possibly one the worst days another person might ever have.",

So obviously i went to my friend's house to get stoned AF. After doing this i begin my journey to trying to make my way to the train station. I find a bus stop that im 50% sure that it'll get me there. While I wait this drunk dude walks by and is on the phone. I kid you nit this mf had some suicide hotline shit going on and was saying shit like \"no don't do it\" and all that stuff. And he just runs off. My imagination starts going off and i get worried that this young girl that used to be like a younger sister to me is killing herself and this fucker was her dad. After bout 5 min i forget all about it and these two tiny people start walking in my direction and i cant tell if its two drunk teenage girls stumbling on their feet after a party or a energized kid holding hands with her mom (its nighttime and im still high). As they come closer i realize its two teenage girls and one of them is screaming on her phone, sounds pissed. Then the drunk dude runs out of the alley the girls came from. He comes to our bus stop. \nSo the girl and the dude start arguing real loud so i decide to start recording. Shes yelling shit like \" don't fucking touch me you sick fuck\" and hes like \"come on give me a hug.\". So from feeling bad for this guy i go to hating his fucking guts. When the bus is arriving he's like\" just give me a hug and I'll admit what i did, its your choice\". She hugs him and then she and her friend get in the bus. Im still recording at this point and when they get off at the same stop as i do. The guy is fucking calling her. She starts arguing with him. Were downtown now so there's way more people around and chick just yelles out from the top of her lungs \"DON'T YOU FUCKING CALL MY MOTHER!!!!\".\n\nI mever found out what the guy did, but i assume some sort sexual assault could be very likely. Si the reason i record people having a bad day is cuz i wanna make sure that im not hallucinating and i can go back and check ut out when sober.",

On our last day we had to leave the hostel at 10am but our flight home wasn’t until like 6pm. So we had the day to kill but many of us were hung over so we opted to just chill by the bank of the river. It was a lovely summer day and we sat in the sun on the grass drinking Bellinis from little plastic flutes.  One of our friends was so badly hungover she went about 15 metres away, to the shade of a tree, and took a nap. We were keeping an eye to be sure she was okay the whole time. Eventually we decided it would be funny to lay the plastic champagne flutes and some cigarette packets  around her and take some pictures posing with her(fully knowing she would find it funny, we knew her humour and she’d have done it to us). After, when two of us who took the pics were walking back the group a random woman approached us and started taking pictures. She got really in our face and when we asked her what she was doing she made comments saying she just thought we were a great couple and obviously she had a right to photograph us. We were weird out and questioned it again when she pointed out if we could take pictures of strangers so could she. It turns out she thought we were just random people taking advantage/pictures of a sleeping girl. We explained the situation and even had to wake our friend up to clarify before she was happy. Looking back on it now... I’m really glad people like that woman exist in the world. People who stand up for others.",

My entire life is oriented around attracting as little attention as possible.\n\nI am terrified to go out in public alone because if I have an episode and someone records me, it could go viral and then my family would know what I now look like and where I am. \n\nIf your life is genuinely under threat or your in traffic having a camera and recording isn’t an issue, It is good to have evidence to turn over to the police or lawyers in the event of a civil suit. \n\nI am disgusted by and scared of people who think it’s funny or entertaining to record people who are struggling. Whether it be mental health issues, drugs, anger, “epic fails”, or the like, recordings of those those things that get posted on social media never interest me.

You have no idea if exposing someones appearance and location could get them killed or put them in life threatening danger. Even if someone is being a cunty karenesque person, do you really want your video to be the reason for the headline “Former viral video subject murdered by Ex due to media exposure”?",

He wasn't asked to leave but his girlfriend's vape had been confiscated for weed (it was still illegal at the time) but the dude was clearly, at the time, on uppers or maybe steroids (he was JACKED and couldn't calm himself down at all.) I finally a couple of times said \"I'd love to work with you and figure this out but you are *screaming* dude, I can't even hear what you're saying\" and he sort of quieted down for a second but then immediately his voice went up again back into shrieking.   \n\n\nWe finally said he'd have to leave and he sprinted away toward the bathrooms so we, on like hour 10 or 11 of our fucking shifts and exhausted, walked after him and then he suddenly burst out of the bathroom with his phone out shrieking again. He shoved it in my face and I sort of couldn't help but kinda smile and said \"you've mostly got yourself screaming on video, you're blowing out your speakers.\" But he just kept shrieking that he 'had me on video' and we ended up having to call the cops because he was simply too huge a dude for any of us to physically remove from the premises. As soon as he heard us make the call he literally sprinted out of the building and honestly we were just relieved he was gone so we could focus on other issues.",

The police explained they would be arresting her and asked if there was somebody who could come and pick up her toddler.  There were several people standing around recording her in this horrible moment and it struck me just how ugly some humans can be. It doesn’t matter if this woman actually knowingly attempted to steal or not, in my opinion. This was obviously a very bad moment in this woman’s life and it must’ve been made worse by those around her just gawking and recoding her in what may have been the lowest moment of her life while she tried to find someone to care for her child while she was arrested. People love train wrecks and destruction for some reason I just don’t understand. Why would anyone record a moment like this?  To share with others or just waxy again on their own?

I live in another county, so the kids near me did not have the day off. I went for a walk and observed three neighbor teens being called racist foul names by a 4th teen. I started a video and told him to stop. He called them more ugly names. I asked the neighbor's kids if he belonged there. They said no. He lived in another neighborhood and drove but was a sophomore and didn't have a parking permit. (The kids park in our area and walk a couple of blocks to the school). I told him to stop and leave. He started saying he had a 1st amendment right to insult my neighbors. I told him no, that isn't how it worked. (You can't disrupt other kids learning or make school hostile for them, and here, the bus stop is under school rules). I told him I would call the cops or he could leave. He left.\n\n  \nThe kids then told me that he constantly did this, and the principal said it was his 1st amendment right to express his political opinions. I told the kids that I'm a mandated reporter and had to take this up with the school. I uploaded it to youtube but the setting where you have to have a direct link to see it. Then I e-mailed the Superintendent, Head of Secondary Education, Head of Transportation, the principal, and the Assistant Principal. I told them that I was notifying them of a failure to protect kids or report abuse. \n\n  \nThe Dad of one of the kids came to see me that evening. The bully was suspended immediately. The Head of Secondary Education had contacted both families about the previous complaints not being investigated. I got a request from the Head of Secondary Education to bring a copy of the video on a flash drive, and I did. I also gave a copy to both families and deleted it from YouTube. About a week later, the Dad told me the bully was transferred to an alternative campus; the district was afraid he might become more violent. At winter break, I saw in local news that the principal had resigned to take care of some family business.",

It was super busy on a Saturday night and a group of four young men came in  (they appeared to be between the ages of 16 and 18) and they wanted to buy cigarillos. My coworker asked them for their ID's (we check ID at the door for anyone who looks under 30). They ignored her as though they couldn't hear her and kept requesting cigarillos and walking around. My coworker came up to me and told me what was going on. \n\nSo, I walked over to them and requested their ID's; they ignored me as though they didn't hear me and kept requesting cigarillos. So, at this point I'm pretty sure that they're underage (ignore and deflect is common among minors trying to buy tobacco products). I was trying to deescalate so I informed them that It's the law that I ask and told them that I could hold the product for them if they needed to run home and get their ID's and come back. Bare in mind, you have to be 18+ to even enter the store, and they looked like teens. \n\nAnother few minutes of them acting like they couldn't hear the request for ID and requesting cigarillos, and I tell them \"Y'all really need to show some ID or leave the premises. People under the age of 18 cannot be in here.\" They tell me flat out they're not going to show ID. So, this shit has been going on a solid 15 minutes and the store is busy. I tell them I'll call the police to escort them out if they cannot prove that they're of age. They then start yelling and cursing. \n\nI call the non-emergency number for the sheriff's office and tell them of the situation (usually people leave a dispatcher pick up the phone and you don't actually have to get them to come).  One of the guys takes out their phone and starts recording me; I try to face slightly away from their camera because I'm starting to get freaked out at this point. \n\nThey're yelling and cursing as they're filming then one of them tells me that he'll show me his ID. At this point I'm going WTF....all this shit and you had your ID the whole time?! He flashes his ID for a millisecond then puts it away. I tell him to show it to me again. He shows it to me, keeping his thumb over the birthday. I ask him to move his thumb. THIS MOTHERFUCKER IS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. I inform him that he's 17. He says that I'm lying and he's actually 18 (he's still filming, so this is for the camera). I tell him that the police are on their way and he can show his ID to the police if he's that confident in his math skills. \n\nThey yell and curse some more then leave. Then these guys called the store about 10 times throughout the rest of the night cursing and calling me a \"bitch\" and a \"c\\*nt.\" I just disconnected the store phone because it was getting out of hand. \n\nNext day, my coworker texts me a link that her cousin sent her....these guys posted the video on their Twitter and Facebook with a caption saying that I was \"racist,\" along with the name of the store I worked at. There were like 500 views and about 70 comments of people calling me a \"stupid bitch,\" \"ugly c\\*nt,\" and saying they would go down to \\[name of store where I worked\\] and f\\*ck me up. THE GUY WAS SEVENTEEN AND HE DIDN'T THINK TO MENTION THAT ON TWITTER. \n\nLuckily, HR lady at my work got all the video taken down, and nothing ever came of it. A customer came in the day after this happened and said a similar thing had happened the night prior at a vape shop a few miles away from where I worked (probably the same guys). Anyways, I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with intrusive thoughts of being secretly recorded so I quit the job a week after because my paranoia got so bad. \n\nSo, in this situation, I guess people do this shit because they're 17 years old and want tobacco products. And to f\\*ck up the life of people with OCD.",

I am on the other side of the street, I see no reason for this, and walk over and take out my phone. The cop was asking him why he didn't have ID, (you don't have to have ID to walk down the damn street), and I had my phone out recording because it looked a whole lot like racial profiling to me.\n\nAnyway, this car whips across two lanes and parka illegally and so young white guy, early 20s at most has his phone out and it screaming about \"we got a Karen!\" I was confused, looking for the Karen in question, and then it hit me, I am a middle age white woman, he means me. He is going on about why did I call the cops on this Black man, and then he stuck the phone in my face. I calmly say, \"I am filming this as an observer because I think it is a case of racial profiling.\" He is continuing on his Karen crusade, and by this point the cop is even telling him, \"no one called us...\" This idiot won't shut up though, he constructed this whole story line about me calling the cops on this guy for walking while Black. Now the Starbucks barista is out there, (that's where I was when I saw this, Starbucks), and she had ran my coffee out to me. Now she is on camera saying, \"she was just inside ordering a drink.\" \n\nIt literally took 10 mins for the idiot to grasp that he didn't catch a Karen in the wild. I am laughing at him, the Black guy is annoyed because this ruined his lunch break, the cop is flustered, and the barista, who knows me, thinks this is insane, and his friend in the car is telling him to hurry up and get back in because the cop has now noticed that they are parked the wrong direction, half out in the street. He started running their plate. \n\nMorons.",

Some of them will resist being taken outside, and a very select few will continue fighting while everyone is outside.\n\nSo once we have removed a very drunk and angry person and he won't let it go. He keeps mouthing off to the guys at the door who don't really react. Finally he starts a shoving match. I and another guy come back outside and subdue the guy while someone else calls the sheriff. Cameras are out. Guy realizes that his night is about to get exponentially worse and stops fighting. I tell him to stay facedown on the pavement and I'll get up, but if he so much as twitches I'll be back on him. I get up and one of the other guys watches him. I tell all the people filming to please back up and give us some room. Pretty much everyone gives us enough room to be safe. Sheriff arrives, applies bracelets, and our former guest to the drunk tank. As soon as the guy is in the back of the car, people lost interest.\n\nI was certainly annoyed that there were a bunch of people recording the fight, but only because they were really close to the action and I didn't know if any them were dude's friends who might jump in. Once they backed up my only annoyance was that I don't particularly like having my picture taken, but since I was acting reasonably I was actually a little relieved that there would be an objective record. When dude sobered up he thankfully decided not to come back to the bar and I didn't see him again.",

I didn't really mean to pull too close to them, but they moved into the turn lane late and then stopped about two cars lengths away from the stop bar (no car in front of them) so I wasn't prepared to stop that far back and my car has issues idling sometimes so I'm often forced to take my foot a little off the break and inch forward a tiny bit. (This often means if I didn't leave enough room I can accidentally get an uncomfortable sort of close) \n\nI then watched them whip out their phone and attempt to photograph me. Yeah, I had been a bit of an arse in that moment, but I can't imagine what would convince you taking out a phone while driving and trying to take pictures on a very crowded road during rush hour is a good idea, ever. Photographic evidence that someone was kind of an arse right before you get your arrogant booty hit? Dunno what that proves at the end of the day.\n\nI think people just want to make everything public or show some proof of goings on. Scratches some weird itch they have, maybe? Media has kind of driven in that if you have video evidence it's also helpful to win a trial or argument after the fact, but it's mostly just helpful for more media and the online popularity contest, not for individual people and it can even get people hurt or killed.",

In highschool a kid crashed his car into a part of the newly installed fences that had been built around the roads on campus. I was eating lunch with some friends right next to where he had crashed, so I rushed over to see if the kid in the car was alright, which luckily, he was. He had gotten out of his car, the front completely busted, and was standing with his hands on his head just looking at it, with a pretty blank look on his face. There weren't a ton of people around at first, but I could already see a massive hoard of students rushing over after hearing the sound of the crash. I walked up to the kid and just asked him if he was alright and if he was injured, in which he replied with a monotone \"I'm alright man.\" I could see he wasn't bleeding or struggling to stand up so I thought it would be fine to leave him and let the school faculty handle it. I turned around to leave and was greeted by a giant crowd of students, I'd say 80% with their phones out, just recording the whole thing, not even approaching the guy to see if he was okay for themselves. I didn't say anything, I think I was a bit shaken as well, but man, it just broke my heart for a few days afterwards. I don't want to make myself out to be some kinda pariah or something, but I was definitely disappointed with the students I saw defaulting to that. Even if he wasn't injured, why would you ever want to record someone going through something like that?",

They used these tactics of recording people with cameras in their faces and shouting off at them. They were not interested in discourse, conversation or understanding the situation, they were there for what they wanted to get. The event was absolutely nothing with what they imagined and ultimately convinced themselves to be. But if you keep acting like that, you're going to get a reaction.\n\nLet's just say that after they had raised their hell, two or three of them were seen around the area after the whole thing. Unfortunately all three had an accident where their phones were damaged and I believe they were found in an alley way after suffering an extreme beating. Thankfully nobody was fully permanently injured but they did learn that they can't just go around acting like that and that nothing will happen because of it because their own belief system or protection of their mobile phone somehow immunises them.\n\nI do wonder if they still engage in the same tactics that they did previously? It's amazing when shit has consequences! I mean I can probably guarantee that one of them does not anymore. That is unless his hand actually got better.\n\nNot that I was involved or know what happened. But I would also say that I don't have any sympathy at all either!",

At the time I just liked recording me and my friends having fun because, you know, having memories to look back on visually is nice. But if they didnt want me to record them or share the pics and videos on the internet then I would respect their wishes on the matter. \n\nBut for some reason though as soon as she noticed me reaching for my camera she started yelling at me telling me not to record a video of her or she would sue me and then demanded I delete everything with her in it, even if it was blurry. So I didn't record her and felt a bit awkward during the event, and felt even worse thinking about it afterwords because it made me feel like she didn't trust me. It also seemed like an overreaction on her part but at the same time I understand that she may have been burnt by other friends in the past who didn't respect her, so I try to remind myself that she may have thought that was the best way to put her point across. But because of that negative interaction I never went to another event with her, not that she seemed interested anyways. \n\nFrom a viewers perspective, it certainly is aggravating having someone else record you without your consent, especially if it's something that you can't control. I also hate it when I see people taking bragging selfies in front of the bombing memorial we have in our city. There are some people who literally only go and take pictures there for social media popularity and it makes me sick to my stomach. It makes me wonder if they actually care about what happened to the people who died there or not.\n\nOn the other hand though, if shit is going down that shouldn't be going down, such as a police officer abusing power, then I would definitely be okay with me or someone else recording as evidence. But that's if action isn't more required, because seeing someone record before actually doing anything is just shitty.",

Told her to be more compassionate towards people and not treat them like shit and don't she dare threaten any server with the review bullshit. I apologized to guests sitting on nearby tables for the commotion and left later one of the servers told me all this while her friend was recording me and the other guests later told them to leave as they all could see how she behaved, the next day she complained to the owner and mentioned her friend had a video of me yelling at them, I discussed what happened I offered to quit but I was very clear that I won't apologize for the incident, you can meet really great people in the hospitality business but some people are just shit, pure miserable shit. \n\nI have no idea if that video was ever posted online but I give no fucks.

I had a weird poncho blanket in my bag and worried that as no help was near he would freeze and struggle after his adrenaline wore off.

I literally couldn’t fathom the level of immaturity and toxicity of such an act toward innocent people leading their daily lives as fallible humans, let alone what consequence they thought would come from it other than some idiots squabbling on the internet. \n\nSomething in me got bitter and pathetic after having been filmed by someone else for internet points where the filming person flat out admitted he intended to lie about the footage and present it as something it wasn’t for internet points, laughing as he saw that I finally noticed him filming - he was very similar to the main-character/narcissist mentality of anything to get ahead online that we’re seeing in the comments of this post. I felt so broken and degraded when he exploited a neurological condition where I shake to create some fake story to make himself popular to a niche group on the internet and me a target of harassment. Even when it was discovered he lied, I got apologies from a few people but it didn’t change the aftermath emotionally and mentally and even in some ways professionally after and not everyone exposed to his video ultimately would hear from others that it was staged and then given false contextual description.\n\nWhen an opportunity arose to do the same when I got furloughed over the pandemic walking home barely fed and stressed out of my mind, I snapped when I saw someone try to take a video of me for not wanting a loose dog in an area where leashes were required actively jumping on me while walking. Because I already shake, when I get scared, I look more ridiculous than usual which is hard to manage and she saw this as a video worthy moment for her friends. I went full Karen and did the same to them by pulling out my phone and filming them for filming me trying to get away from their jumping dog, screaming at both them and the dog. Super cringe, I know.\n\nOnce I realized that, for me, feeling victimized was the new trigger for the behavior particularly after the first instance of being exploited by the jerk who lied about me online demonstrating to me that the internet has real power and consequences to harm others who are uncritical (ie take it at face value) of the information they receive prior to attacking the individual captured in the video, it helped put to bed the behavior of allowing myself the knee jerk reaction to do so when someone else pulled their’s out. The internet doesn’t care who’s right or what the facts are, it cares about who’s most palatable to condemn to feel better about themselves or further their status online - the internet is a status seeking place not justice seeking place and of late a good many of us tend to conflate the two. If you aren’t filming for evidence of wrongdoing AND doing so in a respectful, calm manner, you are caving to that weak part of you that wants your status or control back in your life through the sympathy or righteousness of a crowd you think will support you since they are now real and at your fingertips.\n\nWhat I learned is that people who feel victimized (regardless of whether they are in reality or not) and self absorbed (like the main character of life attitude) are the two major gateways to this behavior of weaponizing your phone not as opposed to needing to pull it out for police evidence rather to create social police evidence. I allowed myself to feel enough of a victim that I wanted to see them hurt the way I was when I decided to lose my shit and be an asshole Karen. Being right in that instance wasn’t what made me cringe, it was the way I handled it that made being right, wrong. It can be said about a good chunk of these filming instances. How and when the internet (ie crowd of internet users) sympathize(s) is ultimately what is being sought out and it is ultimately few’s friend.",
