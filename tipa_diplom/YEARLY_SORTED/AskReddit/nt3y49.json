So I recognize people need to just get thier rocks off every once in a while. But too many people, not all but alot, undermine the dangers of the excessive/addictive behavior and the damage it can cause. Dependance on porn can skew a man's perspective and value on a woman.

Just as one basic example, doctors get paid extra for circumcising, and they also are the ones who recommend the procedure. This is a forced procedure that the doctor is incentivized to conduct.\n\nAnd now imagine being a circumcised male and having a male child, and the doctor, news, and people around are telling you it's healthy and that removing all those nerves and the frenulum and the rigid band isn't bad, and it's fine to do without consent because bABy nO fEEl knIfE beCausE BaBY.

As a forewarning, the following information is very unsettling and will explain why Carter never “kept his promise” of revealing classified UFO information to the public.\n\nAccording to the story that was corroborated by more than one witness, U.S. presidents are only given a cursory overview of the subject. Apparently, the CIA runs the program, only provide information to the President on a need to know basis, and do not consider presidential curiosity as sufficient need to know. This was implemented after Kennedy, and all presidents after him have been given only summary briefings (some presidents for unknown reasons were given more than others).\n\nOkay on to your question. President Carter is a deeply religious man who had also witnessed a UFO with 6 other people. Everyone thought that he would be the one to finally release UFO info to the public but as the story goes, he was repeatedly stonewalled. Eventually, the CIA had “the talk” with him, and afterward it was reported that he sunk his head in his hands and not only began to deeply sob, but was visibly disturbed for some weeks afterward.\n\nWhat was he told and shown?\n\nHe was told that the major religions including Christianity were programs created by extraterrestrials to prevent us from destroying ourselves while they ran their experiments on us – and that they made us. At this moment it became clear to Carter that such information could cause tremendous economic and social upheaval",

They want the west era of control over and a new world order much like what is already in China and if you know anything about Communism is that is scam for the party leaders and members to gain power and advantage in society. This America's number threat, all the riots from the past summer and Covid are all engineered and paid for by China to make China the world's number one and its working! it was predicted that the CCP economy will equal or over take the USA's 2030 now it is to happen by 2025! This is alarming because of philosophy and policy of the CCP. This must not happen and more has to be done to inform people especially the ones 25 years older. If the belt and Road Program is successful then USA will take a back step so that China does not crush us. The already have a navy larger than that of the USA, why? War ships is are not for peace but instead for war and control. This must be to take over Taiwan and get a channel into the pacific where they can continue their represion into other countries. The Chinese fighter jets are invading Taiwan airspace every day since that start of the new year. Investing is happening in higher number into China and not the USA. Something serious is going on and mainstream/social media  are democratically owned who are owned by the CCP just like some Republicans. Why did hate Trump so much? Because Trump really challenged them and the plays invested  know their investment in China would be shaken and that why we have an election like never before. But this is America which has armed citizens according to law the constitution and we must restore order in an lawful and justified way. Too much of the world is already too reliant on China and this shows that they are almost or already to match the USA. THe only thing left is war to prove the point.",

Being good citizens and obeying laws and social norms is complicity with genocide on the same level as Germans during the holocaust, because not only do millions of people starve each year while ppl in the west throw food out of grocery stores, all the \"development\" that y'all take for granted is literally destroying our planet and natural habitat.\n\nAlso, western psychiatry which works so hard to convince people there is something wrong with their individual brains when no we're just traumatized by how shitty the world is and/or how we have been treated for generations based on where they are born and/or the color of our skin, and also generally how much capitalism thrives on isolating people and destroying communities, and crushing creativity out of young people's souls through \"education\". \n\nSo yeah the education system in many different places too.\n\nSome perspectives on what to do about it: https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/anarkata\n\nSub.media/c/trouble",

Male calves are almost all killed for veal or less shortly after birth. Lots of female calves aren't needed either, since to keep up the large milk output they need cows to be pregnant many times in their life, and they don't want to exponentially grow their herd size.\n\nSame story for male chicks, usually macerated by a blender if they're lucky, hundreds thrown in an airtight trash bag whilst still alive if they're not. Chickens like humans have roughly 50% gender distribution so every female chicken you see on a shelf or tiny cage has had a dead male counterpart. This applies to even the nicest of farms with very few exceptions, remember chicken run? The small farm run by just two people with lots of free space? Even they didn't have many males did they, males would cause the eggs to be fertilised after all, don't want that much.\n\nBees are frequently crushed, by accident or deliberately, the bee movie is unironically played down tbh, and the importance of the bee industry is played up, we did fine without beekeeping for millions of years, commercial honey bees are an invasive species in many places, killing more.\n\nNot really deadly for humans mind you (although despite popular belief higher milk consumptions correlates with higher all cause morality and lower bone density)",

The birthing act is not the reproductive act. These things should not need to be explained.\n\nAbortion it’s a wall that separates us in this country; a wall built with the bodies of sixty million dead babies.  This death toll is more staggering than anything the world has ever seen. What makes it more tragic is that the these babies are killed at the behest of their own parents, with the help of so-called doctors, facilitated by the government. In response to the silent screams of these silent sacrifices from our culture mostly is a giant yawn or even applause in some corners.\n\nBut groups throughout all of history have tried to remove personhood rights from other people so it's nothing new under the sun. Yes, throughout history, there’ve been groups of people pointing at other groups of people saying, *‘Those people aren’t people.*  These groups have always said the same thing for thousands of years.  Maybe it’s time we finally do away with that kind of thinking.  … This is the most outmoded and old-fashioned way of thinking there is.\n\nWhat I’m talking about here is not an opinion.  I’m talking about what is true and fact.  The truth is that abortion is the murder (unjustified killing) of an innocent human life; it just is.  It will never be anything less than an outrage or travesty. It’s one of the greatest injustices the world has ever seen.",

It's a danger that's invisible and nonintuitive right up till the moment the tires lose traction.  Few people ever do practice driving at the limits of their car's performance, and have no experience with different skid scenarios. \n\nIf the front tires lose traction first in a panic stop or evasive maneuver, the car will [*understeer*](https://img.youtube.com/vi/EwmDdMzzDjY/0.jpg) or snowplow straight ahead instead of responding to steering inputs.  This is relatively easy to sense, and correct from.  However, if the rear tires lose traction first, the car will *oversteer,* meaning the rear end yaws sideways or spins.  If it hits a curb or rut while sideways at speed, the car will roll like a bowling ball.  Hitting a pole [or tree while sideways](https://www.google.com/search?q=car+sideways+into+tree&tbm=isch) makes one of the worst crash outcomes.  Without practice and development of muscle memory, oversteer is difficult to sense in time, and nearly impossible to correct for or recover from very early in the spinout process.  Successfully correcting oversteer requires instant, reflexive correction, including recorrecting the other way to prevent or mitigate fishtailing.\n\nCalifornia even made it the law to install new tires in the rear.  In practice, tire stores just put them where the customer asks because they're burned out on explaining in vain to literally everyone. ^^Ed:links",

            "text": "Copy pasta warning.\n\n\nRabies. It's exceptionally common, but people just don't run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.\n\nLet me paint you a picture.\n\nYou go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the \"rage\" stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.\n\nExcept you're asleep, and he's a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don't even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.\n\nRabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won't even tell you if you've got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you've ever been vaccinated.)\n\nYou wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.\n\nThe bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.\n\nIt may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?\n\nAt this point, you're already dead. There is no cure.\n\n(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).\n\nThere's no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.\n\nAbsorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you're symptomatic, it's over. You're dead.\n\nSo what does that look like?\n\nYour headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You're fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your \"pons\" is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.\n\nNext you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn't occur to you that you don't know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.\n\nAs your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it's a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they'll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.\n\nYou're twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what's going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It's around this time the hydrophobia starts.\n\nYou're horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can't drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You're thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that's futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.\n\nYou begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you're having trouble remembering things, especially family.\n\nYou're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you \"drink something\" and crying. And it's only been about a week since that little headache that you've completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.\n\nEventually, you slip into the \"dumb rabies\" phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You're all but unaware of what's around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it's all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven't really slept for about 72 hours.\n\nThen you die. Always, you die.\n\nAnd there's not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.\n\nThen there's the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.\n\nSo yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me. And it's fucking EVERYWHERE. (Source: Spent a lot of time working with rabies. Would still get my vaccinations if I could afford them.)",

AND I feel it could be treated better with that Hydro-whatever it is than by their various 'vaccines'.  The vaccines just make money while the Hydro-stuff TREATS it and probably would save more people.  For me, the argument is NOT about the existence of the Covid-19 but about how to deal with it in the best and safest way.  Fauci is still a fraud and he owns stock in these Vaccines so he cares more about cases and money for each case than about people.

Many common diseases in the 20th century are more deadly than people realize. Measles for example hospitalizes one in every 4 people who get it. Meaning if nobody got vaccinated and just ran around our healthcare systems would almost instantly get overwhelmed. There used to be only 30-100 cases before the anti-vax movement gained traction, 2014 saw over 600 cases. The MMR vaccine is over 90 percent effective, so if you get vaccinated you’re saving about 3 people from getting hospitalized because on average you spread measles to about 12 people. We have a preventative cure that requires little time or commitment, and it’s imperative that people realize the implications of not getting vaccinated.",

If you insist on tanning for the summer or whatever PLEASE WEAR SUNSCREEN. Regular tanning will ruin your skin even over the short term.\n\nIts very easy to suffer from heat exhaustion or dehydration from prolonged sun exposure, people often dont even realize its happening, and it kills. It happens faster than you think. Many high schools have stories of kids dying from heat exhaustion from sports practice and what not. One minute you and your buddies are playing catch in the sun with your shirts off at the park, and 15 minutes later your friend is panting on the ground having hallucinations with wide, wild eyes. \n\nForget about skin cancer. Cosmetically speaking, it turns your skin into leather and ages you very quickly even if you don't get sun burns, avoid skin cancer from lifelong tanning ect. I have too many friends in their late 20s with the skin quality of a 50year old. No disrespect, just saying.  I think everyone agrees that we like our skin to stay nice and healthy and youthful looking. The Sun is the antithesis of that.  The easiest way to preserve your skin to avoid excessive exposure to the sun. STAY OUT OF THE FUCKING SUN Y'ALL",

Many people don’t realize the respect that you need for the ocean, to some the waves look enticing and fun, exhilarating to say the least. Which they are, but it only takes an ounce of misjudgment to put you in harms way. I’ve seen parents let their kids play in waves only experienced surfers can handle. I grew up in Southern California, spent most of my time at The Wedge. It’s menacing and it tests the best of us. Respect the ocean, or perish. I’ve been bobbing in those waters for a while, an 8 foot wave may not sound big to most, but I promise you, if an 8 footer landed on your head, you’d be regretting ever leaving your front door. Let alone 15-20-25 feet. If you don’t know what you’re doing, you’re a deadman with ease. Respect the beach! And you’ll have your life.",

Yeah, so, that's only a thing in salt water. Someone who inhales fresh water like that will probably just die, but very few people realize this difference. \n\nIt has to do with osmosis. When you inhale water, the cells in your lungs try to equalize the salt levels in the water inside and outside your cells. The water in your cells is typically pretty full of electrolytes, so it's relatively salty. If you inhale salt water, there's a pretty decent chance that the water in your cells will be around the same saltiness as the water you just inhaled, so the amount of water that gets moved into or out of your cells is fairly limited, meaning there isn't really any instant damage. But if the water you inhale is fresh, then suddenly there's extremely low salt-content water outside the cell and fairly high salt-content water inside the cell, so water rushes into the cell to dilute the high salt-content water in an attempt to make it the same amount of salty as the water outside the cell. This is bad, because it means the cell will burst. Your lungs are damaged severely from pretty much the moment you inhale fresh water, and it doesn't really matter if you get the water back out again because your lungs are fucked up and you won't be able to breathe anyway. \n\nAnd this isn't an attempt to scare people off of swimming in lakes or anything. But you should realize that there are dangers involved in activities on fresh water that just aren't present when you're on salt water. And that almost every single film and TV show in existence will depict a drowning as if it were in salt water, regardless of what type of water they're actually in.",

Without getting into it too much, it releases hormones that regulate many things. You wouldn't expect this tiny little organ to be so important, but holy crap it is. \n\nI found out I had thyroid issues when I was 15 after I was constantly tired, had irregular periods (I've gone two months without a period before), my weight was out of wack, my mental health was constantly declining, and I had issues with breathing among other symptoms. \n\nApparently if I hadn't started taking thyroid medication when I did, I would've gone into a coma within 2 weeks. \n\nIt didn't help that I had a dad who constantly made fun of my weight and appearance even after finding out I had thyroid issues and learning how hard it was for me to loose weight. Turns out, his two sisters had Hypothyroidism and his brother had Hyperthyroidism. \n\nIt took quite a few years to finally find hormonal balance and I'm 20 now, but I'm doing a lot better than I was before, physically and mentally.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for telling me your stories and experiences, it's made me smile seeing that you guys are recovering/recovered. \nI'm not good with words and there's probably a lot I'm not expressing, but The test they do to check your thyroid/lymph nodes is painless and easy. There's a lot that can happen due to these glands, so have your doctor check if they don't do it automatically. \nYou can never ask too many questions when it comes to your health :) \nI wish everyone here the best 🧡💙🧡💙\nhttps://www.thyroid.org/",

And not just in the sense of sterilization, but also improper stretching, lubing, and proper maintenance of your body and toys/ insertables.\n\nI work in an adult stores, I do my own research into the products we sell, and let me tell you, the horror stories of newbies just picking up a 8 inch dildo after seeing a porno and going \"Hey, if they can do it, so can I\" are too many to count. I have seen/heard/brought close friends of mine to the hospital and ER just to help them get their body patched up from improper use. I have seen the result of improper use of non-lubricating substances on peoples bodies. And I had a friend who died from a terrible rectum infection. \n\nLook, I know some if you are going to do these things anyways, and I have already made my point, but if you want to protect yourself, here are 5 things to ensure you all are safe from bad sexual practices:\n\n1) SOAP AND WATER: clean yourself and your toys before and after. Regular, unscented soap and warm water will be enough. There is also toy cleaner on the market which works just as well. \n\n2) START SMALL, LOTS OF LUBE: those professionals on the XXX tapes? They are \"Professionals\" for a reason! They work their way up to those sizes. So start small, and use more lube then you think you need.\n\n3) MORE LUBE: I aint kidding, the more the merrier. Also, I always recommend Water and Silicone based lubes. The following is NOT LUBE: Bengay, butter, tobasco/hotsauce, alcohol, plain water, spit, semen, juice, bleach, clean solutions, blood, and anything else that is not Water/Silicone based lube!\n\n4) IS IT USED, OR DO YOU NOT KNOW WHO HAD IT? DONT USE IT: STDs are still out there, and can be easily carried over on toys that infected individuals play with, even with soap and water. If you know the previous owner is clean, still proceed with caution. Also, ask for permission before you play with other peoples toys.\n\n5) PAIN IS NOT PLEASURE: Look, as much as the BDSM community will glare at me for this, if it hurts, pull out immediately. Pain is your body's way of saying \"STOP!\", so ignoring it is both stupid and life threatening. Only follow pain once you are certain that its the expected kind of pain, like spanking, soreness, and electro play. Actually, double check that last one, that may be a fault in your vibrator....",

Many times visitors see locals enjoying different activities and or have read/heard of hidden gems but don’t take into account the actual hazards which are unseen. The amount of tourists who die while on vacation here is sobering. Not all of these deaths make it to the news either (our “industry “ is tourism; go figure). Just because people are enjoying a spot or activity does not necessarily make it safe for everyone. I’ve personally heard too often after rescuing people from the surf that they didn’t think it was that dangerous because they knew how to swim, and that it looked safe enough. Valley and ridge hikes, another killer. Know before you go. Respect da locals by asking. Better to go home from your vacation with sunburn because you didn’t apply enough sunscreen, than go home or send a loved one home in a body bag because you didn’t ask a local about the hazards of a spot or activity no matter what you THINK you know/ heard /saw on social media.

And yeah, while it’s true that every creature in our habitat has venom or teeth, that’s not going to be what kills you here. \n\nThe two biggest killers of tourists in Australia are the ocean and the weather. \n\nIf you live in a climate where 27C (80F) is a heatwave, you have *no* concept of how to endure temperatures of 45C+ (113F). Or shit, even mid-30s. Dehydration and heatstroke are extremely dangerous, and if they don’t get you then there’s always skin cancer. The sun is stronger than you think here, and you’re going to need  to reapply that 50+ SPF every 4 hours. \n\nThen there’s the ocean. In South Australia, where I live, the ocean comes right off Antarctica. If you’re not a strong swimmer and you get out of your depth, you’re going to be in trouble. Most of our beaches don’t have lifeguards, and it’s not uncommon for there to be rips. If you’re right down the south coast where the surf is (prime tourist hotspot) there are also waves and rocks to contend with. We have a lot of people come here from places where they don’t have easy access to the beach, or they do but they’re used to something a little more gentle. There are multiple drowning deaths every year here because people just don’t understand the ocean and nobody’s ever told them they need to be careful. \n\ntl;dr: maybe think twice about coming here in summer.",

They can cause your liver to shut down very quickly and cause heart attacks. \n\nThese little fuckers have selenium in them, healthy in small quantities but on average just 28 grams of Brazil nuts contain 988% of the Reference Daily Intake. One nut contains 96 to 400 mc of selenium, 5000 mc has very a good chance of killing you. \n\nI ate 500 grams of these while studying, being too lazy to go to the store. A couple of minutes after I finished the bag I started having trouble breathing, I got up, became extremely hot in a flash and got a cramp in my chest. I’m young and relatively healthy but my body was in fight or flight mode, I think because of the adrenaline my mind just cleared up. Because I’ve never really had any allergies I googled “Brazil nut poisonous”, found the information and called the poison hotline. I explained my symptoms and told him about the selenium toxicity, he had no idea it was even a thing. He’s panicking (lol) so I calmed him down and hung up, called the ambulance while opening all the doors in my apartment building and laid down on my bed. By the time I got to the hospital I was breathing better and they got me on a drip, I explained to them how many I ate and what I read online.\n\nWell, they diagnosed me with a nut allergy and sent me on my way.",

I mean the life long kind where you cant seem to bridge the gap and nothing you do seems to change it.  The kind that feels like its destroying who you are. Soul Cancer.\n\n[People can die of a broken heart.](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiomyopathy/what-is-cardiomyopathy-in-adults/is-broken-heart-syndrome-real)\n\nI feel like theres not enough good mental health support in general and help for people who are alone and lonely. This ranges from teens all the way up to the elderly who become shut ins. Socializing with other human beings is a basic human need that most all of us have unless you finally get to the point you give up and become a complete misanthrope and you are unable to even make connections anymore.\n\nThink about prison, how do they punish the worst offenders there? Solitary confinement. More people fear loneliness than they do death. Its a very serious epidemic all over the world right now and theres just honestly not much if anything being done about it. I feel like there should be classes in school to teach kids to socialize in a healthy way and make friends. As well as a mandatory place in every town, city, village etc to where people can find their people. Society with all this technology that \"pretends\" to connect us does nothing but put us further apart and its a damn shame the amount of people everyday who commit suicide or turn to drugs or a life of crime simply because they get to a point they dont know how else to cope.\n\nI really hope one day something will be done about this so nobody ever has to feel a lone or be alone again.  Because its such a needless thing that could be avoided. I realize there are  many MANY other problems in the world but this is a very real one too thats just never even been attempted to be dealt with in a realistic manner. And to me thats a damn shame.\n\nAnyway just some thoughts. Just passing through. Not really feeling up to discussing this but i wanted to mention it. I hope everybody has a good night/day and if you are struggling with loneliness i hope you are able to find ways to cope and find some peace even if just for a little while.",

Basically what can happen  is that someone in one part falls down and the people are so densely packed that the pressure around the now gap in the crowd causes the people around the opening to fall down, eventually the bodies accumulate and people are crushed or suffocate. This can also happen just by being pressed against a solid object such as a wall or barricade. What really makes them deadly however is that often crowds can be so large that people can be dying in one area while other members are completely unaware. This makes it so that the only people who have the ability to stop the crush end up being the people who dont even know it's happening because they're too far away.

In 2014, among children 1 to 4 years old who died from an unintentional injury, one-third died from drowning. Among children ages 1 to 4, most drownings occur in home swimming pools. **Drowning is responsible for more deaths among children 1-4 than any other cause except congenital anomalies (birth defects).** Among those 1-14, fatal drowning remains the second-leading cause of unintentional injury-related death behind motor vehicle crashes.\"\n\nNow consider that only a small number (Google suggests <5%) of homes have a pool. So most of those drownings are coming from a minority of households.\n\nAs a parent you're inclined to worry about more sensational dangers like kidnapping by a stranger. But, if you have a pool, and a young child, the pool poses orders of magnitude more danger to your child than a stranger kidnapping them. In fact, it poses more danger to your child than everything else in their life.\n\nA family member of mine had their 5-year old drown in their in-ground pool.

Many older people take serious falls but it only takes something like a couple teaspoons of water for a little one to dry drown. Instead of breathing in the water a small amount makes their vocal chords spasm and close. I read about this years ago where babies will accidentally breath in just a miniscule amount, often times mom not even realizing it and afterwards baby takes a nap and doesn't wake up. I know this is somewhat rare but just reading that one story has made me hyper aware and I'd rather keep bath time short. It gives me a bit of anxiety. She plays with the faucet so I've bought two covers because my eldest hit her head on a faucet but this baby takes them off quicker than I can put them on, she messes with her bath temperature so I have to keep correcting the temp, and of course worst of all I worry she will fall (she likes to try to walk around) and stand up. \n\nIf anyone has any safety tips like a good faucet cover, how to keep a baby from wanting to frolic through the tub please let me know.\n\nAnd if your little one goes under even for a second (even if they seem fine) in the pool or bathing keep an eye on them.\n\nSymptoms of dry drowning\n\ndifficulty breathing or speaking.\n\nirritability or unusual behavior.\n\ncoughing.\n\nchest pain.\n\nlow energy or sleepiness after a water incident.",

In the end, we don't hear much about it, and the electrical grid is not equipped to handle these events. If/when such an event occurs, it's essentially a SHTF scenario (NOT GOOD to a catastrophic and society shattering degree).\n\nThe reason EMPs didn't curb everything in the past is because society - at that time - wasn't built entirely around electricity. Now, everything - almost all cars, almost everything we use \\[refrigerators, manufacturing equipment, pacemakers, hospitals, energy facilities (including solar and wind), the Internet (that's a biggie as far as vain panic settling in), etc.\\] - is predicated on electricity.\n\nThe last *major* event (not \"major\" like the 1989 event) happened in 1859 (over 160 years ago). If that happened today, which we're due for, it would take 4-10 years to recover. Currently, the ability to manufacture transformers (where power isn't cut off) is an extremely specialized endeavor, which takes over a year - let alone the need to build way more than one.

I just had my 45th surgery, including five in the last year (age 52), my sister has had well over 70. Thyroid cancer is often caused by radiation exposure and we have had countless scans of all types. When I  was 36 my primary doc retired and when I found a new one he did a full physical that included checking my thyroid by running his fingers over my thyroid gland. This is how I found out I had Stage 4 thyroid cancer that had entered a lymph node. No doctor had ever done that before, and it was only dumb luck that my doc retiring led me to the new guy. My sister was found to have it last year the same way, but caught earlier. We both had total thyroidectomy and radiation and survived, but it was closest to killing me of all the cancers I've had (multiple intestinal and GI, lung, stomach, etc). PLEASE ask your doctor to do this test- it is noninvasive, simple and quick.Many docs simply don't include it as part of a routine physical. Finding it early is the key since it kills you by spreading through the lymph system and then cancer just shows up everywhere- bone, organ, skin etc. I have radiation scans every few years to make sure the cancerous thyroid cells don't pop up elsewhere.",

I have worked in Aauatics for over 10 years, have held onto a CPO (certified pool and spa operator) license for 7 years and have worked on everything from athletic training pools to apartment complex pools.\n\nThey are disgusting to say the least, but the amount of chemicals that go into them make it safe to swim in is insane, and the chemicals we put into them are extremely dangerous on their own. \n\nFor example acid is added to all pools, like burn your skin to the bone acid, to balance out the PH. We have to wear full protection gear to add it to the feeder. We dilute it before adding it to feeder but even the diluted stuff will burn through your skin. The feeder adds small amount of it to the pool every 10 minutes or so, but it just takes a malfunction to dump the whole thing in, cooking everyone alive.\n\nThen the chlorine is also super hard to maintain, if it is to high, you will leave with chemically burned skin, if it is to low, you can get sick from the million of germs that it is supposed to kill. Most people who test pools don't really know what is to high or to low, especially at places where the pool isn't the money maker like hotels. Also for outside pools we add an additional acid to the pool to help protect the chlorine because chlorine burns up more in the sun.\n\nThen there are the filters and pumps. Some filters have such fine media that when dry will cut up your lungs if inhaled. The pumps also have super strong suction, look up Virginia Graeme baker pool law, it is about a law that was passed because drains at the bottom are super dangerous and a child got eviscerated by one.\n\nAnd finally the water itself. To fill an average pool you need about 30-50 thousand gallons of water. That is a lot of water and extremely expensive. They recommend draining a pool about a foot every month and adding fresh water. No one does this because it is expensive because of the water an sewage cost. So a lot of pools have water that has been sitting there for 6 months to a year or more, just constantly getting more chemicals added and never getting changed.\n\nFinal note, I personally still go in some pools, especially if it is a place I have seen people maintain the pool or the pool is the main focus. I'm not trying to say never go in a pool again, It is a lot like vaccines, the right people work with the dangerous stuff and balance them so we all can enjoy the benefits of them.\n\nSide note, hot tubs are gross, I never go in them, 2 people in a hot tub is equivalent to 250 people in a regular pool.",

People speed, text and drive, and drive drunk or high as if they aren’t actively risking their lives and the lives of others. Maybe my example is bad, maybe everyone knows how dangerous it is, but I doubt many actually think about it.",

Hugging a lemur that you do not have a strong bond with (I mean trust, not “love” as they rarely trust anyone outside of their troop) is practically asking for it. Ringtail lemurs are extremely defensive wild animals that are defensive thanks to the somewhat harsh environment they come from (not the rainforest, Madagascar isn’t one big rainforest smh). They are not “mean”, they just know what stranger danger means.\n\nRingtail lemurs have been known to scalp humans who unknowingly step into their territory in the wild. The scalping reportedly happened in about 15 seconds. Guests tapping on the glass of their enclosure while I’m inside could agitate them and put me in harms way. It annoys the shit out of me. If I didn’t have a death wish (lol /s) it would make me pretty nervous. \n\nPrimates in general. They’re intelligent, armed with very long, sharp teeth (not all but many), and a grip strength so strong that it can peel the flesh off our puny human bodies like cheese sticks? Yeah, sure.

Woke up with a fever, took some tylenol, went back to bed. My spouse woke me up because my breathing 'sounded weird' and forced me to go to Emergency, where I  was admitted for sepsis and pneumonia. None of the doctors could believe I'd run a 5k that day because I was in such dire shape. Apparently I had the infection so long it weakened my system, and running the race was just enough stress to break me.

            "text": "**Punches.**\n\n**Nose punches?** Your nose is an incredibly complicated structure full of hundreds of little cavities and tiny bone pieces. Inside the nose there is a vertical lamina of bone that divides the left part from the right, and it goes from above your mouth's roof all the way up to the very base of the cranium. (The cranium confines directly with the nose, sometimes they perform brain surgery through it.) Where the cranium meets the nose cavity it's made up of a tiny ridiculous layer of bone, the upper limit of the main nasal cavity, that is as thin as a few paper sheets and full of tiny tiny holes to let some braincells dangle down in the nasal cavity to feel smells. You punch someone in the nose with the wrong angle and the vertical lamina will shatter and be pushed backwards and upwards, going right through that little bone on your cranium and stabbing your brain. Brain damage from that is often ridiculous, but the nose's main purpose is literally to get dirty as fuck to clean the air you're breathing, while your brain has to be always absolutely sterile. You'll develop brain infection (called meningitis) and die within days.\n\nAlso that area is crazily vascularized, full of blood vessels. It will bleed so much you could literally drown in your own blood. Medical procedures literally say that before you can intubate a patient with a broken nose or a skull base bleeding you have to be sure you can do it in a few seconds, or when you open their airways to do it they'll have a shit ton of blood going into their lungs. If you survive drowning from it, blood in your lungs will *certainty* lead to lung infection, often very severe. \n\nThese punches are so dangerous that they are banned in all combat sports like box or martial arts.\n\nAlso **chin punches**, if you punch horizontally you'll break your opponent's jaw, but not if you punch upwards. The jaw is built to withstand a lot of force in that direction and teeth are super hard. That way all the force will go to making your cranium quickly move upwards. You brain is not attached to it, it's floating in brain fluid inside it, and it will not follow its movement if not with a significant delay. Your brain will hit the inside of your skull really fucking hard, and brain bleeding is nothing to joke about.\n\n**Head punches** will easily kill you, but even if it's not hard enough to do that, if you fall backwards and bang your head just right you're gone in a second. It really takes much less than most people realize.\n\n**Chest punches** can break ribs, and ribs bend toward the inside when they break, meaning they can puncture lungs and big blood vessels. A punctured lung will collapse on itself in a matter of minutes, requiring intensive medical care and possibly surgery, other than being at an incrediblly high risk of developing infections and blood clots. The last ribs down can stab your kidneys, liver or spleen, and all those three organs are basically sponges full of blood that will bleed like freaking crazy. Having one of those three punctured, especially the spleen, can easily make you die of internal bleeding. \n\nFront punches on the chest will compress your heart, and the heart really does not like that kind of stress. Heart bruising often leads to heart failure. \n\n**Throat punches** will bend and break the cartilage structure on your trachea. Bleeding in your upper airways could very easily end up in your lungs, and lungs really don't like having blood in them, instant lung infection that will require days, probably weeks in the hospital. Blood is quite and very sticky, so it's very hard to cough up if the bleeding is too far down. \n\n**Gut punches** can make various organ bruise. Those organs are almost always in motion, if they swell up you will not be able to properly eat and process food and could end up with serious complications like intestinal blocks. \n\n**Punches on the center of your back** can damage your spine, and **on the side** they can break ribs and hit your kidneys. Kidneys are floating in fat tissue up there, they can move and shift and do all sort of shit. They *will* get bruised and it's not funny. Loosing a kidney is really not that hard.\n\nAlso fun fact, big bones (especially the long bones in your limbs) have *huge* arteries attached to them. The homerus has the brachial artery and the femur has the femural artery. The femural is gigantic and the brachial is smaller but very close to the heart, so very pressurized. Breaking one of those bones is quite likely to end up injuring one of those arteries. Look out for bruising or swelling sensation if you break your arm/leg. \n\nKilling or seriously injuring someone solely by punching them is far more easy than most people realize. Once you killed another person you're a murder and there's no going back. \n\nDo not ingage in fights, especially if you're physically bigger than your opponent and if you don't know what you're doing and how to avoid serious injuries, or be prepared to have your life thrown down a shit hole.\n\nSource: I'm in nurse school and my anatomy teacher loved to tell us how easy it is to kill people (spoiler: very, very easy)",

Speed 2 gets a bit sketch. Speed 3 and 4 though? If you weren't paying attention and had your arm in to scrape and forgot the speed was still set to 3, your arm would be gone instantly. The possibility scared the shit out of me so I was always careful to turn it back to 1, always.",

Most people know about the normal hazards, but arc flash is no joke and doesn't get mentioned much. If you ever switch a breaker at home, look away, close your eyes, and hold your breath. If something goes wrong inside the switch, there could be an arc that creates your own little temporary sun and vaporizer the breaker. Turning away increases survivability, and holding you breath prevents the vaporized copper from entering your lungs. Also, anywhere with equipment, assume the electricity is MUCH more powerful and just don't touch it. Leave that to the electricians. \n\nOn the topic of electricity, many large appliances like computer screens or microwaves have capacitors that can hold charge long after unplugged. If you take these apart, unplug and leave unplugged for multiple days to allow them to discharge. Even then be careful around the electronics. \n\nFinally, the part of the microwave that produces the waves (the magnetron), often contains Berylium, which will ruin your lungs if breathed in.

But because of how their teeth are designed,  puncture wounds seal any bacteria deposited in the wound in there. You can not clean it it out. It’s trapped down there to fester. If you get a bite that leaves puncture wounds the only way you can properly clean it by yourself is if you slice it open with a knife or something. Obviously not all that good of an idea. \n\nIf the bacteria gets a hold it can be almost impossible to kill it off. We are talking hospital stay with some serious badass antibiotics and too often it’s still not enough and then you move on to surgery to flush out the joints and if that still doesn’t help and turn it around it’s amputation time. If their front fangs puncture deep down in the tissue it will look like nothing and it won’t really bleed at all and that’s when you are in deep shit. You need to get to an ER or something immediately, do not collect 200 do not pass go, straight to an er. You need antibiotics and you need it *before* you know that it’s infected. People who get limbs amputated and die from cat bites does so because they wait and let it take hold. If you aren’t up to date you need a tetanus shot as well as an immediate dose of antibiotics with a prescription for the next day. And that’s in good cases. If they think it looks bad they’ll likely clean it out immediately at the ER to be safe. It’s really really dangerous and serious and time sensitive. \n\nThe worst bite I have gotten looked the least serious. I have been bitten many times before, the danger of catching and taming strays, but those haven’t been puncture wound and have been open and bleed a lot. Aka they clean themselves out by bleeding and can be washed out. This was just two little dots. And that’s when I knew I was in deep trouble and needed to go to ER. Got my tetanus shot and antibiotics to last until the pharmacy opened and a prescription and was fine! Woo! Might not have actually needed the antibiotics since the swelling and redness started to go down while waiting at the ER but I kind of like my hand so I want to keep it you know. You could be lucky and not get infected by any nasty bacteria, but if you wait and see it could be too late. You really can’t afford to wait.",

Not true. \n\nHerbivores are actually often more deadly than carnivores. Sure, if you approach a tiger, said tiger may try to kill you, perceiving you as a threat/snack, however no predator has humans as their primary prey. We're far more dangerous to them, given that we often come in groups and have weapons, but we're also not worth the risk. We're not very meaty compared to a gazelle or a bull, and the trouble of chasing us down (we're the ultimate persistence hunters; not the fastest, but most animals, especially sprinters like the cheetah, tire far more quickly, so we just follow them until they tire out then kill them), fighting us, and killing us just isn't worth it. Unless you're perceived as a threat to the predictor or its young, most will just avoid you. Conserving energy is crucial to anything that hunts for food. \n\nLarge herbivores have no such issues (we're not counting things like disease spreading, o we're mostly talking about bigger ones). Plants are everywhere, otherwise they wouldn't be here. There's not as much need to conserve energy when you can just eat nonmoving plants. As such, there's no need to weigh the risk/reward ratio of attacking a human. Sure, they usually avoid us too, but they're also often quicker to attack when threatened directly. For them, it isn't about the food, but about removing any potential threats in their territory. A bull is far more likely to gore you on his horns than a lion is to pounce on you.",

Most people probably have no idea that this is true.\n\nCulturally, the minimal and debatable health benefits (wine has antioxidants!) seem to be repeated disproportionately far more frequently than the many, many drawbacks.\n\nIt *is* a poison.

But a perhaps surprising statistic is that the .22 is the deadliest caliber in the world.\n\nFor those not well versed in firearms, the .22 is one of the smallest calibers there is, and is fired out of often very small handguns -- think, like, the James Bond up-the-sleeve tiny spy gun (the Walther P22 in that example).  These guns often have very little recoil which makes them feel less powerful/serious than the person firing it might realize, and so are much more deadly than a lot of owners might assume.\n\nMy dad worked in law enforcement and he has seen a heartbreaking number of cases where a couple old friends got in a stupid fight or someone wanted to show off how cool they were at a party and ended up waving around a .22 pistol that they underestimated the deadliness of.  Guns don't have to be big or flashy or loud to be deadly.  A hole just a couple mm wide in your body will kill you just the same as a larger hole or explosive shrapnell or ugly hollow-point entry or anything else.\n\nTake your firearms seriously, folks.\n\nEdit to add that the .22 is also a very common caliber so that probably plays into the statistic as well but it's the only caliber my dad said he's seen so many cases of being responsible for an unintended death because of specifically being underestimated.  Unlike other common calibers like .38 or .45 or 9mm which he said people tend to treat more seriously/carefully/intentionally.",

The pain is insane because exposing it to the air hurts like hell but so is closing your eye lids. You just cannot be comfortable. There is very little the doctors can do for you.

            "text": "Rabies \n\nEdit:credit to u/bryan66wilson\n\nYou asked...\n\nRabies. It's exceptionally common, but people just don't run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.\n\nLet me paint you a picture.\n\nYou go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the \"rage\" stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.\n\nExcept you're asleep, and he's a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don't even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.\n\nRabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won't even tell you if you've got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you've ever been vaccinated.)\n\nYou wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.\n\nThe bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.\n\nIt may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?\n\nAt this point, you're already dead. There is no cure.\n\n(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).\n\nThere's no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.\n\nAbsorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you're symptomatic, it's over. You're dead.\n\nSo what does that look like?\n\nYour headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You're fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your \"pons\" is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.\n\nNext you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn't occur to you that you don't know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.\n\nAs your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it's a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they'll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.\n\nYou're twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what's going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It's around this time the hydrophobia starts.\n\nYou're horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can't drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You're thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that's futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.\n\nYou begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you're having trouble remembering things, especially family.\n\nYou're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you \"drink something\" and crying. And it's only been about a week since that little headache that you've completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.\n\nEventually, you slip into the \"dumb rabies\" phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You're all but unaware of what's around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it's all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven't really slept for about 72 hours.\n\nThen you die. Always, you die.\n\nAnd there's not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.\n\nThen there's the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.\n\nSo yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me. And it's fucking EVERYWHERE. (Source: Spent a lot of time working with rabies. Would still get my vaccinations if I could afford them.)\n\nEditing to add continuation from OP of this copypasta (u/ZeriMasterpeace):\n\nEach time this gets reposted, there is a TON of misinformation that follows by people who simply don't know, or have heard \"information\" from others who were ill informed:\n\nOnly x number of people have died in the U.S. in the past x years.  Rabies is really rare.\n\nYes, deaths from rabies are rare in the United States, in the neighborhood of 2-3 per year.  This does not mean rabies is rare.  The reason that mortality is so rare in the U.S. is due to a very aggressive treatment protocol of all bite cases in the United States:  If you are bitten, and you cannot identify the animal that bit you, or the animal were to die shortly after biting you, you will get post exposure treatment.  That is the protocol.\n\nPost exposure is very effective (almost 100%) if done before you become symptomatic.  It involves a series of immunoglobulin shots - many of which are at the site of the bite - as well as the vaccine given over the span of a month.  (Fun fact - if you're vaccinated for rabies, you may be able to be an immunoglobulin donor!)\n\nIt's not nearly as bad as was rumored when I was a kid.  Something about getting shots in the stomach.  Nothing like that.\n\nIn countries without good treatment protocols rabies is rampant.  India alone sees 20,000 deaths from rabies PER YEAR.\n\nThe \"why did nobody die of rabies in the past if it's so dangerous?\" argument.\n\nThere were entire epidemics of rabies in the past, so much so that suicide or murder of those suspected to have rabies were common.\n\nIn North America, the first case of human death by rabies wasn't reported until 1768.  This is because Rabies does not appear to be native to North America, and it spread very slowly.  So slowly, in fact, that until the mid 1990's, it was assumed that Canada and Northern New York didn't have rabies at all.  This changed when I was personally one of the first to send in a positive rabies specimen - a raccoon - which helped spawn a cooperative U.S. / Canada rabies bait drop some time between 1995 and 1997 (my memory's shot).\n\nUnfortunately, it was too late.  Rabies had already crossed into Canada.\n\nThere are still however some countries (notably, Australia, where everything ELSE is trying to kill you) that still does not have Rabies.\n\nLots of people have survived rabies using the Milwaukee Protocol.\n\nFalse.  ONE woman did, and she is still recovering to this day (some 16+ years later).  There's also the possibility that she only survived due to either a genetic immunity, or possibly even was inadvertently \"vaccinated\" some other way.  All other treatments ultimately failed, even the others that were reported as successes eventually succumbed to the virus. Almost all of the attributed \"survivors\" actually received post-exposure treatment before becoming symptomatic and many of THEM died anyway.\n\nBats don't have rabies all that often.  This is just a scare tactic.\n\nFalse.  To date, 6% of bats that have been \"captured\" or come into contact with humans were rabid..  This number is a lot higher when you consider that it equates to one in seventeen bats.  If the bat is allowing you to catch/touch it, the odds that there's a problem are simply too high to ignore.\n\nYou have to get the treatment within 72 hours, or it won't work anyway.\n\nFalse.  The rabies virus travels via nervous system, and can take several years to reach the brain depending on the path it takes.  If you've been exposed, it's NEVER too late to get the treatment, and just because you didn't die in a week does not mean you're safe.   A case of a guy incubating the virus for 8 years.\n\nAt least I live in Australia!\n\nNo.\n\nPlease, please, PLEASE stop posting bad information every time this comes up.  Rabies is not something to be shrugged off.  And sadly, this kind of misinformation killed a 6 year old just this Sunday. Stop it.\n\nEdit: Original Post by u/ZeriMasterpeace, they deserve the upvotes/awards. Michael Scott also has a Race For The Cure if you’d like to donate to a good cause.",

However, most of the air ends up coming back towards the dam itself in a recirculating current not away from it.\n\nThis makes it more deadly as you can’t swim in air, so you end up sinking faster than if it was just water. All while constantly being tumbled around in the boil zone with no shallow section to stand on. The worst part is they look exactly like a safe current as well meaning you can’t tell the difference above the surface.\n\nAlmost all people stuck in one drown, and most of the \ntime they can’t send rescue in due to the danger. So they have to wait till the body gets spit out eventually.... \n\nthere is an old video of 3 firefighters rescuing another drowned firefighter, and as the boat approached the boil it capsized. There was only one survivor. \n\nAnother scenario was a couple kayaking. They both went over a 1 foot drop and the kayaks could not escape the boil aand turned over. Both drowned. \n\n#Conclusion\n\nNever swim under, go over a small dam for fun or in a kayak unless you check them out ahead of time. \n\nIt’s impossible to tell the difference between a safe and dangerous one unless tested (throw an object in it).

Within two days he was severely ill and weak. His blood sugar count was down to 66 and his face and eyeballs were yellow. He was rushed to the emergency at Pali-Momi, where he was diagnosed to be suffering from massive organ failure. He died shortly before midnight.\n\nNo one would have made the connection between his job and his death, had it not been for a doctor who specifically asked if he had been in a warehouse or exposed to dried rat/mouse droppings at anytime.\n\nThey said there is a virus (much like the Hanta Virus) that lives in dried rat and mouse droppings.\n\nOnce dried, these droppings are like dust and can easily be breathed in or ingested if a person does not wear protective gear or fails to wash face and hands thoroughly.\n\nAn autopsy was performed on the clerk to verify the doctor's suspicions...\n\nThis is why it is extremely important to ALWAYS carefully rinse off the tops of canned sodas or foods and to wipe off pasta packaging, cereal boxes and so on.\n\nAlmost everything you buy in a supermarket was stored in a warehouse at one time or another and stores themselves often have rodents.\n\nMost of us remember to wash vegetables and fruits but never think of boxes and cans.\n\nThe ugly truth is, even the most modern, upper-class, super store has rats and mice. And their warehouse most assuredly does!\n\nWhenever you buy any canned soft drink, please make sure that you wash the top with running water and soap or if that is not available, drink with a straw.\n\nThe investigation of soda cans by the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta discovered that the tops of soda cans can be encrusted with dried rat's urine, which is so toxic it can be lethal.\n\nCanned drinks and other foodstuffs are stored in warehouses and containers that are usually infested with rodents and then they get transported to retail outlets without being properly cleaned.",

He ended up on an antibiotic IV and several types of antibiotics before one worked and he ran a high fever for several days. You can lose nerve function, digits, limbs, vision, and of course your life. Sepsis is incredibly dangerous and is the main reason why people died young before antibiotics. There are many ways to get it, but all ultimately it's from untreated infection that has gotten into your blood stream. Death can come quickly and every minute counts when someone has sepsis. If someone you know has an infection you know is getting worse, make them go to the ER. Forgotten tampons are also responsible for many cases, and women who have just given birth are at high risk. Clean all cuts with soap and water, Neosporin is a good preventative, but you're definitely not guaranteed to get infected without it.

I brushed this off as just random soreness, though. Then, it started swelling, and my father takes me to urgent care. They tell me I've got an infection, and put me on antibiotics. The next day, the swelling gets worse. We decide to give the antibiotics another day, though. We wait, and the swelling is absolutely terrible. Half my chin was basically 2.5x bigger than normal, and I can't speak or swallow without pain. \n\nI go to my dentist as an emergency patient. My dentist puts me on more antibiotics and I'm told to come back the next day. We return, and the swelling had gone down slightly, but was still really bad. At this point, my dentist sends me to an oral surgery place, and the doctors there become very worried about me, and consider sending me to the emergency room. This was because they said the swelling had spread to my neck. \nThey instead choose to call in their own surgeon, and he basically explains to me that he can pull my tooth and drain the infection through that. He said I would have to get it done that day because with how it was spreading, it would very likely close off my airway in the next couple of days and suffocate me. I of course got the surgery done, and I'm supposed to be getting a tooth implant 3 months from now. Brush your teeth, people.\n\nTLDR: Cavity caused infection, and swelled up so much it almost closed off my airway.",

You’ll be fine, but now you’re coworker who took their grandmother dinner twice a week is at her funeral because she wouldn’t be fine if she caught pneumonia.\n\nIf you’re sick or hurt let your body rest, if it’s any kind of severe go to a doctor.

Most livestock are tall enough that if you are unlucky enough to hit one, they roll over the bonnet of the car and through the windscreen when you hit them.

It’s basically the weight of a small car and rather than hitting the engine block and crumple zones that are designed to protect you on an accident, it hits the glass windscreen instead. \n\nBe careful on single track country roads.

Most of us did cross it without injury but another girl go stuck in the middle and thus I was stuck behind her. \n\nThe other went to see what was further while the fog was coming up. There was a frozen river crossing our path so we were absolutely stuck. We called the emergency (we nearly had no signal). They send an helicopter but we were really difficult to find because this wasn't fog, we were in a cloud that would become a storm. \n\nWhen they finally found us they said that we had half an hour left to be found. Otherwise, it would have been impossible due to the cloud. And if we tried to sleep there, we would have been killed by the cold. \n\nSo follow the guide's parth. Always. He knows way better than you do",

It may not sound like much but given that the average background radiation dose per year in my area is about 4 mSv it doesn’t take long to double your exposure without realising. The most dangerous thing about it though is that it’s almost completely undetectable without a Geiger counter. The radiation breaks down the pigments that were in the paint (after about 10 years) so it no longer glows but it is still just as radioactive (radium’s half life is about 1600 years).

As the years went by I didn't particularly notice any difference other than when they would grow once in a while, and then eventually it stopped which I thought was great.\n\nI wasn't able to get dental coverage due to being jobless and the pain came back but more severe. I hadn't visited a dentistry in years until last December (when I was 28) as I was finally able to afford it, and I went with a new one which had panoramic x-rays (which my old one didn't). Apparently the third molar nerve was dead and the mandible second molar nerves were half toast, and the reason was as the wisdom tooth grew in on an angle it pushed against the molar and it decayed underneath the gum causing an abscess. The reason the pain was so bad is because the abscess grew to the point of it bursting, which caused a pretty severe infection.\n\nHe extracted the wisdom teeth and performed a root canal right after that so it was one heck of a day, but even after having it removed, taking antibiotics, strong painkillers, the pain worsened until I got sepsis two days later. I'm fine now but at the time I wished I just got them removed before I was laid off, and plan to keep on top of cleanings and checkups.\n\nNot everyone needs their wisdom teeth out, but if at any moment you suspect you should get them pulled (especially if you have the money) I would go with your gut, as it'll save money and pain in the long run.",

(Iron is measured on a scale of 1-10 and a healthy person is usually a 6)  she sat in the hospital and got pumped full of iron for a day and the dr said if she doesn't get help to lower her stress and her iron doesn't improve then he's going to have to get her tested for leukemia because it looks like its headed that way.\nSomething like that if I remember correctly. \nLuckily, my aunt was getting a divorce and moved in and the va gave her a full time nurse as well and her body healed and went back to normal. \nStress will break your body down and make it destroy itself with out you even knowing..",

This can cause undue pressure on the heart, resulting in palpitations, rhythm problems and sometimes death.  Unfortunately I got Pericarditis from hand foot and mouth after being exposed to the virus at work (a hospital emergency department) and was so severe I required ICU admission and complete bed rest for just under 5 weeks.

I’ve been stepped on, kicked, bitten by, and fallen off plenty of horses. I’ve heard tons of horror stories about horse-related injuries.\n\nThe story that sticks with me the most is of a trainer that was killed by her own horse in a freak-ish accident. After taking her horse out to pasture, she unclipped the lead rope from the bridle to turn him loose. In that brief second her horse turned to take off into the pasture, he managed to kick her in the head after bucking. It dented her skull and killed her instantly.\nI think the worst thing about it is the kick from the horse, in all likelihood, probably wasn’t meant to be nefarious. Horses tend to get excited when being turned out for what they know is unsupervised play time and all you can eat grass, and they often get the “zoomies” which they express by galloping around, kicking, or bucking. The likelihood that her horse probably didn’t mean to kick her just makes me so sad.",

Their swim speed is also deadly as fuck, going 40 km/h so it’s no wonder seals get eaten trying to escape polar bears and for the record, the fastest human swimming speed was 7.6 km/h.

Not minutes or hours, but that dam will keep rolling a 30ft few hundred pound trunk of a tree for daaaaaays before it gets out.  Itll man handle that thing like a lion with a mouse.",

Surgical complications can range from minimal to profoundly morbid or downright mortal. Do not mistake me, surgery is an enormously beneficial service, but it's also more deadly than most people realize.\n\nAn example is bariatric surgery, particularly gastric bypass. Again, don't get me wrong, a lot of people have benefited from it. The field is supported by a vast number of published articles that overstate the benefits and understate the risks however. First and foremost, morbid obesity is a major risk factor for any operation requiring general anesthesia. The complications of rearranging the intestinal tract are bizarre and and often specific to the nuances of an individual's surgical outcome. These patients receive an inordinate number of CT scans (radiation is good, right?) whenever they need emergent evaluation, which is often. These patients often have comorbid psychiatric conditions (often undiagnosed) and become dependent on medications for nausea and/or pain. They develop bowel obstructions, ulcers, strictures requiring intervention or re-operation.\n\nSo, I would argue that surgery, particularly bariatric surgery, is more dangerous and deadly than most folks realize.",

There’s a huge trend right now on TikTok with kids buying machines off Amazon and tattooing themselves and each other. \n\nThere’s a reason I had to be apprenticed under a “master” tattooer for three years, take several medical courses, and get several medical safety certifications before I could even APPLY for my body modification license. Hepatitis, staph infections, fatal sepsis. It all happens. Right when I first started a local scratcher (the name for unlicensed tattoo enthusiasts buying machines online and tattooing in their house with no sanitation- just like these TikTok kids) gave someone a shitty hand tattoo. It was infected so badly the hand DEGLOVED. That is, the infection detached the skin from his entire hand and one day it all slipped off like a fine silk glove. He is disfigured and disabled forever over a shitty tattoo of a spider. I’ll never forget the photos all the artists were showing us apprentices. I wish I had them saved so I could show them to anyone doing this. \n\nPathogens are everywhere, constantly. They’re all over your skin right now- you can literally give someone a staph infection by touching their upper arm then touching the tattoo you’re doing on their stomach, because different areas of the skin have different bacteria and now you’ve injected that bacteria under the skin 1,000 times a minute with a needle.. Even if you think you’re disinfecting, you’re not. It’s little bits of knowledge that count, like the fact that you can’t disinfect safely with isopropyl alcohol because it evaporates too quickly to kill pathogens. There’s a fine mist of blood and fluids getting shot into the air by the intense action of tattooing someone. Now it’s on your clothes, your face, your hair, your tattoo chair, your floor, all the cords and wires, likely your entire setup because it’s uncovered because you don’t KNOW to cover it all in disposable film, your ink bottles, your paper towels. Hepatitis B survives outside the body for 7 days. Now you have a “client” come the next day and you wipe down their fresh tattoo with one of those contaminated paper towels. Now they have hepatitis B. \n\nCome on kids, there’s a reason tattoo artists have 5 or so different certificates on the wall when you walk into their studio. You can kill someone, more likely you will maim them. It takes a real lucky streak NOT to infect a tattoo when you don’t have any training.",

            "text": "Stress. Stress fucking kills you, and relatively quickly. Knew a guy who was an ex-semi pro tennis player, ran annual marathons. Was 44 and in better shape than most 20 year olds; poster of great physical health...well seemingly. Dropped dead in line at his favorite coffee shop one morning. Heart attack and he died before he hit the floor. He was a salesman, and under constant stress from really vile bosses; on top of that he was pissing money out because of a nasty divorce while trying to put one of his two girls through college. Never had a real outlet. Just smiled and acted confident/happy all the time. \n\nThen me. I used to think intense physical activity was a suitable outlet for stress. It’s not. It builds and festers in your mind like an infected wound of the mind and spirit. I was a champion nak muay and did bare knuckle a few times in Thailand and Laos. Constantly training and eating perfectly. Poor timing with having children I wasn’t ready for and covid closing down all of the gyms and venues in Thailand and I lost everything on a couple of bad financial mistakes while taking care of my family and paying hospital bills for my injuries. Add into the mix living in a country that does everything in its power to\nDrain a foreigner of their money through corrupt bureaucratic processes and it become almost impossible to float.\n\nLiving in a state of constant severe anxiety caused my adrenal glands to shut down and ruined my thyroid gland as well. I blew up like a blimp in a year despite diet control and exercise - fattest I’ve ever been. Then I all my injuries came back three-fold. I got hooked on opium and spent two years basically in a opium induced coma, barely able to get out of bed and be a father/husband. Using intravenous drugs was my escape from the insurmountable pressure of having my life do a massive 180 from total success and happiness/fulfillment to losing almost everything in less than a couple years. Had to sell jewelry including our wedding rings - some of my late mother’s handed down pieces  just to cover rent and diapers.\n\nThe stress/anxiety ruined my sleep cycle. I wake up feeling like I have a fever and gasping for air because I hold my breath during my stress dreams. I never get deep restorative sleep. Always tired. The stress got so bad at times I lost the ability to get an erection despite being young and “healthy”. Regular vomiting, and the worst migraines imaginable. \n\nMy panic attacks have gotten so bad that sometimes I will pee in empty water jugs because I’m too scared to leave my room and it’s just impossible to walk down the hallway and confront even my family just to go to\nThe bathroom. \n\nI’m searching for real methods for dealing with trauma and stress and not just trying to put bandaids on massive wounds. Learning to properly vent and not stuff crap deep inside and pretend I’m invulnerable. \n\nGetting rid of chronic stress is a lifestyle\nChoice and not just something you can “cure” with a magic pill or a hobby, etc.\n\nGet help. Don’t let stress eat you up. It will ruin you hard and fast. Letting it come out in the form of completely unhinged mental breakdowns is not okay, either. If you find yourself coping with strange behavior or extremely unstable episodes time to reflect and start digging out those cancerous mind tumors.",

            "text": "Alpha Galactose IGE - Alpha gal for short. It's an immune response that comes from the Lone Star Tick and causes intense itching at the site of any bite, even when the tick has not attached. It literally inoculates a person against a carb (alpha galactose) found in all mammals except humans and old world monkeys.  When something from any other mammal is ingested, there will be a reaction - anything from a headache to anaphylaxis. People usually discover they have this when they get hives repeatedly for no apparent reason and go to a doctor who is informed about it's symptoms. The reaction can occur 3-6 hours after exposure to the mammalian substance. What makes it dangerous is that when someone doesn't know what's causing it and they eat a large steak they can die from the anaphylaxis (or when someone  is unable to respond and is in the care of someone who is not informed). Even eating jello or marshmallow can cause hives, and putting a cream or ointment with glycerin in it on an abrasion can cause the area to turn red, swell and itch like mad. So, not the most dangerous thing in the world, but dangerous because of the lack of common knowledge of it's existence and what things contain mammalian substances.",

Addiction is when that drug basically controls your life as far as relationship, finances, job performance, health and even death. Any addiction can cause that whether addicted to drug, alcohol, power, gambling, sex or whatever. Drug abuse is a mental illnesses and just taking medication away from the severely disabled is not going to fix the problem since 80% of those who get addicted start before 25 years old and most people who are being prescribed are over 50 years old which have the smallest rate of abuse. 85% of opiate abuser and addicts never got a opiate prescription from a doctor before in there life..

People don't really have any idea how dangerous steam can be, especially pressurized steam. There are lots of physics and science that go into why steam is very dangerous that I'm not going to get into, but a very basic and simple explanation is that heat is always attracted to things cooler, so if you take steam and expose it to your skin, your skin is obliviously cooler than steam and when steam contacts your skin and returns to liquid your skin will absorb 912 BTUs per pound of water/steam. When your skin reaches between 140 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit, there will be nerve and tissue damage. \n\nWhen you add pressure into the equation, from a pressure cooker, insta pot or even if you have a low pressure boiler heater in your home then things get really bad. Even at low pressures like 10 to 15 PSIG steam will be around the 250 degrees Fahrenheit mark. That is also one of the reasons why you never ever put water into or on hot oil, oil has a higher boiling temperature and water will flash immediately into steam and expand rapidly into a gas, pretty much causing an explosion of hot oil. So always be careful when dealing with steam, it can be very dangerous.",

My aunt and I were across the table but we watched him for a long moment before it clicked in my head. I ran around the table and pulled his chair out before giving him the Heimlich. I remembered to press just under the rib cage and not the actual ribcage, and out popped an inch of his tacito. As soon as it came out I let him go and moved back to sit down like nothing happened.

It’s a drug, it is very addictive just like alcohol and addiction is a very real thing that can happen to anyone. And even if you can’t overdose on it, weed addiction will destroy your mental health, I’ve seen it first hand. With excessive use, you almost won’t be able to do anything without it. It’s just like how smokers often find themselves unable to do anything without smoking, you can’t eat without smoking, can’t go out and socialize without smoking, and in severe cases you can’t even control your emotions without smoking\n\nI hate to be that guy, but just live your life sober. If you can have fun while being sober for the love of god don’t get yourself hooked on stuff because you will severely lower your life span for substances that you could have easily lived without. You’ll love a much better life without weed or alcohol",

Despite authorities warning against it, signs and other warnings saying DO NOT GO IN. \n\nNo matter how calm that water looks, never EVER go into rivers. Water just past your knee is enough to drown you. \n\nThose currents are FAST and they are STRONG. You will not win! A friend of mine’s uncle tried to cross the river, and drowned in the process. Rivers are not jokes people. Way too many people jump in and never resurface. Especially young children, who’s parents knowing they’re by the water don’t teach them simple water safety. \n\nIt can take up a month to find your body, so we sure as hell won’t be able to find you while your still alive in the water.
