            "text": "I used to work as a bathroom attendant for a very expensive bathroom. My bathroom had a $500 cover charge plus additional wiping and washing fees, of course. A demanding job to say the least, but it was a very good work experience and I was lucky enough to see and hear some of the best poopers in the world.\n\nIt's remarkable what a true professional is able to squeeze out with hardly any effort. These men were like world-class clowns shaping their various balloons into all sorts of fantastic creatures and eerily detailed caricatures, only their medium, of course, was high quality fecus. Some would take hours painstakingly crafted their sculptures with merely their dexterous sphincter and agile legwork.\n\nThe smells they could waft into my waiting nose made me feel like a hungry patron at a Michelin 3-star restaurant as the chef plays with wild and exotic flavors in combinations never seen before. It was truly unbelievable to try and sniff through the layers of stink that had so carefully been woven together. I'd close my eyes and try to solve the poopiful puzzle laid before my olfactory, but alas, my senses were never keen enough to hang with the likes of these experts. Even with veteran attendants explaining to me in painstaking detail the perfumist’s craftsmanship of each stench composition, I never quite developed the nose for it. Not to say I didn’t appreciate it. Those stanks were among the stinkiest I ever stunked in.\n\nFarting seems so crude a word for what men of their stature and prestige were able to perform. Imagine the horns section of an orchestra comprised of the greatest and most talented hornsmen of the last millennia playing a symphony so sweet and so moving that the audience weeps for they have not heard anything likes of this before and are already sad as they realize this moment is finite and their deflowered ears will never hear of such divine exquisiteness again. The ballad of the anus danced in my head with each customer and they all played their own haunting and unique melodies.\n\nTheir wiping techniques were unparalleled, as was the extraordinarily high-quality toilet paper we provided. For most, all it took was one tight wad of plush paper and graceful flick of the wrist to remove any excess fecus that may have still clung to their rectums. As much of a thrill it was for me to watch such consummate professionals work their wiping magic, more often than not, they let our state-of-the-art bidets do what they were engineered for. I was never allowed to use them, that may be needless to say, but imagine it must have felt like a dedicated team of maids and washmen set upon to clean every single nook and crevasse. No stray particle would be left unloosed, and I want to believe none ever did.\n\nMy job of course was to not listen, smell, and appreciate what marvelous poopers I stood before, but to attend to their needs post-defecation. I was always careful not to make eye contact because someone as lowly as I should not be so bold as to presume I may look upon the face of those so brilliant. As soon as the stall door swung open on its golden hinges, I was there with soap and perfumes ready, pre-scrubbing and scenting as they made their way to the washing basin. The water - I trained for months before I could draw it - had to be the perfect temperature lest we lose our prestigious customer base.\n\nI would wash their hands completely, scrubbing their nails and massaging each finger and joint. Then I would proceed to massage their shoulders and work my way down their back to their glorious buttocks. Sometimes they'd greet my deep tissue glute kneading with a friendly fart, a thank you, if you will. Then my work would be complete, and I'd offer a variety of the finest mints and mouth washes so that they may continue their day at top form.\r  \nThey would never tip, not a single one, but the job experience alone made it all worthwhile.",

Real live girls posing as human statues with squid tentacles draped over their boobs/pussy. Elephant processionals and hot pink diamond encrusted machetes. $1,000 magnum bottles of Rose Ace that I poured like kool aid. A veritable procession of every kind of rare and sought after car imaginable. I’ve seen a Baht Mitzvah (sp?) where a massive ballroom was fitted to look like willy wonkas chocolate factory, complete with flowing chocolate fountains, ful size real trees (that had been chopped down and shipped to the venue) and a stage for Flo Rida to perform on. The kids all got on stage with flo rida and all started jumping up and down simultaneously and one of the massive trees by the stage tipped over and SMASHED into a chocolate fountain… i watched it all happen from the back of the room, while dressed as a like, a gay NYC cab driver? Idk that’s what the client wanted me to wear so that’s what I wore 🤷‍♂️ \n\nBut what really sticks with me was the sheer lack of any hope. After some shifts i would just break down and cry and say over and over to myself “its *never* going to get any better.” To see that kind of money, and to be sort of mentally abused by that kind of money… it’s hard, I wont lie. One time a very rich CEO made all the staff dance for him. That was embarrassing. One time some guy picked up like 100 napkins and started throwing them in the air… my boss told me to follow him around and pick up the napkins.\n\nThe thing is, these rich people are *so* insanely rich that theyve become entirely detached from reality. They didn’t treat me like shit because they were mean people… they treated me like shit because it never occurred to them that I was a real, live, human. Rather, they seemed to think of me as a sort of machine made of meat.\n\nI fell into a horribly dark depression after that job and im just sort of coming out of it right now. My goal is to have as much money as those people. My goal used to be to be kind and compassionate towards others. My entire life I never gave a shit about money, I just wanted to create art and inspire other people. but that job changed me. I have *never* EVER witnessed power like money. Listen to me very carefully… there is NO force of nature on Earth that can rival the sheer force and power of money. Whatever youre doing, drop it and start thinking about money. I guarantee you that money is more important than anything you’re interested in. What do you want in life, love? Money can buy that. Health? Money can buy that. The power to enslave people? Money can buy that. Violence? Sex? Euphoria? Purpose? Money Money Money Money Money. \n\nMy new goal is to have so much money that I can be above the law. I want to be untouchable and i want to inflict misery and depression on poor people. Just for once, i wanna know what its like to have the shoe on the other foot. What would my life be like if I had their money? I could do whatever drugs I feel like. I could punch people in the face who I don’t like. Hell, i could even do drugs WHILE punching people in the face. A famous rockstar literally did just that at my work. Zero consequences whatsoever… the employee he punched sued him and they settled out if court. The settlement money is only important to the guy that got punched. To the rockstar, the settlement money was a nice way of saying “stop bothering me or else I’ll punch you again.” In other words, money is of zero consequence to these people.\n\nWhen I worked that job, I basically got about 3-4 hours of sleep for a week at a time, and my waking hours were spent getting belittled by rich people. I can tell you from experience that that kind of schedule can absolutely break you. I was a different person before that job and im a different person after. \n\nI just hope and pray that I can find a way to get enough money to make poor people suffer as much as I suffered.",

I got a lot of odd jobs at that place. From dessert maker, back room cleaning, manager office cleaning) - we had one guy who I remember well solely for this event, one day while our Scottish chef was busy trying to restock the chips and keep on top of soups, and I had one eye on the front for people waiting at the till. I ended up watching this guy. He went to the breakfast section grabbed I'd say 6 rashers of bacon, got a bowl of soup and dunked the bacon in the soup. (Much to the annoyance of our chef who when told by me said \"he did fucking what to my soup? What?! Doesn't it have enough flavour for the fucker?! He's having the beef, pepperoni soup and he still wants more salt or something?!\" We had used the left over pizza from the previous days as flavourings for the soups, dough not included, cheese was though) and this customer went down the self service doing this at least 6 more times to this soup.\nThe chef was so pissed off, he went upfront to do the till and told the guy he would be billed for each of his 7 purchases in 1. Guy was completely chilled, asked for his usual dessert as well which had the chef fumming because he didn't have time to make a hobnob crumble, Greek yoghurt and strawberry sauce jam pudding. Bill came to 27 for this guy and he just chuckled handed over his American express.\n - that was the day I began learning how to do desserts.\n\nOther one was a bit more tame sadly.\nI worked at a little chef for a while as a barrista. We has this regular who judging from conversations was a manager. He'd take members of staff to us, despite being next to a town centre with actual good places to eat. They'd sometimes be chit chatting, sometimes he'd be telling them off for reports he had. It was always different. - he had unusual taste in foods. I don't know if he had been trying 1 of every option on our menu. Or if he did this so regular he was bored of the normal. He'd do prawn cocktail with baked beans and hasbrowns, and have a second plate later of a dessert type level of thing.\nEach time we confirmed with him if it was a split bill or who would pay and were they okay with the cost. Which his plates alone would reach 25-35 quid and in a little chef that's impressive, it's not a luxury place. With one to two staff with him meant he'd regular reach 50 pound a day with us. \nAgain American express. He'd always pay for the whole thing even when his staff interjected.",

Firstly, I knew a tenant who would put the lint from the dryer into the laundry room sink and run the water on it as if to flush it down the drain. Guess who had to clean that up every single time he did it? \n\nSecondly, when people throw out garbage, but more specifically empty boxes in our basement, there are two types of tenants. There are those who cut them up and fold them to either be tied and put out to the alleyway by me or just put in a bag. I love those people. Then there are those who will just toss the entire box basically how it was right after they opened it next to the garbage cans in our basement and leave them there. While yea it is my job to just take those and throw them away, its really fucking annoying to be cutting up these HUGE boxes, (Like I'm taking sofa sized boxes) and throwing them away when they're still filled with styrofoam and a bunch of extra shit that came with the package which gets on the floor and means I then need to clean the floor. A little effort to throw that stuff out beforehand would go a long way. \n\nThirdly, when people get packages delivered to my building they are always surprised when I give it to them. Like they'll be walking in the front door, and I'll say \"Hey X, there's a box there for you, let me go and get it\" and they'll be genuinely surprised as if they weren't expecting anything. Now this wouldn't be odd if it happened every now and then because I get it, surprise packages come in. But it happens SO often that I think they order so much stuff online that they don't even keep track of what's coming in, because I know for me when I order stuff, I'm basically tracking that shit daily until it gets here.

Just take a trip to the Sahara with a model and shit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's like playing GTA with the motherlode cheat on. \n\nThis is in a foreign country with a big wealth gap. \n\n  \nIn the US where I live I have a pretty normal, low-key life and hang out with people with normal incomes, so it's always a big shock to return home and see how differently some people in my social circle live to most of the world.\n\n It makes you question the basis for capitalism, not people making incomes but the fact that fortunes can just be inherited over again and invested into valuable assets and no one is ever going to run out of money. Not really fair imo.",

I’m not saying all of them are cause they’re definitely not, but gah damn man I hated doing security work for these type of people. A lot think they can do and say whatever they want with absolutely no consequences. It’s funny cause the property I did security at required me to tell them “no” and damn did they hate that. I had a very intoxicated woman who was some type of Hispanic/Latino call me the N word non stop while I escorted her drunk self back to her room, mind you I’m a Hispanic male myself. Few of them are very racist, especially once they start drinking they think because I’m not black even though I’m still a minority that I won’t care about them saying the n word or referring to others as the n word. It came to a point where I dropped the hospitality act and had to tell the people to “shut your fucking mouth”. There are definitely those who are awesome individuals though, they ask for a section in the lounge to be saved for them, so me being security I go ahead and set it up for them and they tip me $100-$200. I’ve seen a lot of prostitution among the super rich as well though, so they’re definitely a part of the problem in the sense of human trafficking not to mention the amount of drugs circulating also. A lot of the super rich blew my mind on how some weren’t business owners, lawyers or doctors ended up being in some sort of illegal work. We had a whole sting operation where I worked that brought down an asshole that pushed A LOT of drugs and A LOT prostitution. I’ve seen the owner who is a billionaire turn a blind eye to certain things to an extent because the super rich people coming to his property spent A LOT of money soooo basically keep the big whale coming. I’ve also seen a very wealthy Venezuelan family have their daughter marrying a very wealthy Russian families son (both were owners of oil or something) and damn was that wedding GORGEOUS. Very respectable families on both sides. And they took care of us providing the security services for them and everyone. A lot of them seem to be into all kinds of fetishes and what not also. Like I’m talking about a dude who had 4 other women (sex workers) urinate on him then vice versa. The room was a mess lol\n\nEdit: super rich celebrities were cool I guess too, I had the opportunity to meet Nipsey Hussle a few weeks before he was murdered. Drake is definitely an interesting individual, I did security work for him when he was doing his “Scorpion tour” and him and his crew had an after party till about 7am (I clicked into work that day at 2pm the day prior) lol",

She has a house in Hawaii and wanted to fly to a city on the mainland, but she doesn't like first class from Hawaii because she had a bad experience one time.\n\nSo, no problem she can use her NetJets private jet. But she doesn't want to pay for it. So....\n\nShe arranges to make another large donation to her alma mater (she already donated between 10-20 million and has her name on an entire school.  \"The so-and-so School of Whatever\") and so she calls the president of the university, makes the arrangements, and suggests that they gave an event for this donation. Just so happens, a decent number of other wealthy alumns live in Hawaii, so why don't they all fly over for the event on a larger private jet, and oh by the way the university should cover the cost of the charter.\n\nI write this in present tense (sort of) because the arrangements are currently being made.\n\nTL;DR- lady makes huge donation to university out of spite, to avoid flying first class or on her own private jet.\n\nTL;DR 2 - future generations of college students will be studying using facilities paid for out of spite, all because some first class flight attendant a decade ago spilled some peanuts or something.\n\nEDIT2: Lots of discussion about her motivation for all this. I'll clarify...from what I can tell it has nothing to do with generosity or a desire just for a free flight. Here's a clarification from farther down the thread...\n\nMy impression, based on her telling me this story is this...\n\nShe won't fly American Airlines out of Hawaii, even though she flies first class for free, because she \"had a bad experience\" once a long time ago. (Keep in mind she'll fly American other places, just not out of Hawaii).\n\nSo, her alternative is to use one of her NetJets planes. But why should she pay for a charter, when it's really the fault of American Airlines?!\n\nSo, let's see what can she do... hmm... Oh, I know. Let's get someone else to pay for the charter. How about...her alma mater, with which she has an excellent relationship already. So she has her office call the president of this university and say she'd like to make another donation. Some arrangements are made, some other people get involved, a whole lot of running around is done by her people, the university's people, the offices of these other wealthy alums, etc. Hell, even my employees will eventually spend some time on this, selling some of her positions to get the cash.\n\nUltimately, she doesn't have to fly American, she doesn't have to spend her money (this is a matter of principle, not!!! economics), she gets a \"free\" flight out of Hawaii on a larger jet than she otherwise likely would have, with no more effort than spending a few minutes on a phone that someone handed her.\n\nWhat's the downside? Granted, she's spending a lot more money to do this, but it is (as I've said) literally of no concern.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind, obviously, she told me this in a very different tone that I'm relaying it here. lol",

Anyways that project was intense it took like just a month setting rails. Because it was essentially train tracks BUT they had to be cast forge as continuous no breaks. ANd the whole like 50ft building couldn't have more than 1/16th of inch in variance end to end or you would shatter the glass panels. So we dig tracks  with mounts for height brackets. Pour concrete this takes like a week. BUT then we spent like a week laser laser laser just ever so slightly adjusting each bracket to perfection. Weld it in place double check everything finish the welds. Then place on train tracks do the cast welding specialty guy came for that. Then grind laser grind laser over and over again. Then fill tracks with concrete up to bottom of train tracks clean and finish final double checks. \n\nBut that guy always had a project 5yrs with that company and there was always a crew at his place doing something. Changing one area adding another. Sometimes it was wierd stuff like that pool house we went and built a floor over the pool so they could have a wedding reception out there then took it down later. \n\nBut alot of ridiculous stuff was rich guy money poor guy taste. Like one place we worked on guy ordered barnwood flooring of pure walnut. Couple hundred a sq ft was like why isn't this smooth. Anyways so ground it down a ton so it was smooth like glass.

They have their ID'S ready, account numbers written on laminated paper for me, correctly spelled payee cashier check notes. Wires that never get sent back. Those 75% participate in every charity in my now booming area. A client of ours took me into his freaking helicopter and I can only service basic needs at the bank. Another knew I loved golfing and took me to a private celebrity golf tournament where all the buy ins were donated to an MS Foundation.  It is a legitimate joy working with individual/corporate millionaires who are from the community you work in. Most just want their dream home on the lake/ocean/hillside and for their grandkids to never struggle. \n\nEven before this job, when I was a bartender at a seaside tourist bar, I had a patron who would tip me $100 minimum. Like 1 beer he would just hand me a $100 bill. He lived in this vacation town community and just wanted the bartenders company. He was too drunk to drive one night so I drove him home in his car and called the other bartender to come pick me up.

She came there to make clay pieces. We admired each other’s work and began chatting. She dressed very simply worked very hard. She was kind to everyone. Her pieces were beautiful beyond words. One time I asked if she would show me how she made bowls. She met me one morning and spent a couple of hours showing me a lot of really important aspects to the whole process of making a functional bowl. She told me she was having a Christmas party and gave me an invitation that had been photocopied on a plain sheet of white paper — a small map but no decoration. I put it away but decided I’d go because she was so nice.\n   On the day of the party, I dressed and went over the map. I knew a couple of streets and it looked like a straight run out Sunset Blvd. What I didn’t understand was that it went so far down Sunset that I was driving in a very hilly area and the houses started getting bigger, and bigger, and BIGGER and further apart and the addresses were almost impossible to notice. Luckily, the map was really accurate and even though the engine of my car was struggling, I finally made it. I was so nervous about driving up such a steep incline and the possibility of being arrested (African-American) I had to sit in my car and compose myself and dry off. My heart was beating like a herd of stampeding buffalo. When I buzzed to enter, she ran up to me and hugged me and told me she was so glad I came. Even though the house was the most beautiful home I had ever been inside, it was not full of unnecessary crap. She and her husband treasured art and books.

He told me \"the closet behind the stage.\" I didn't know there were closets behind the stage. I found out that night that there were two closets behind the stage. I went to the wrong one first, with nothing but my flashlight to light the way. There were some chairs there, but they were like ottomans and I needed chivari, but I noticed that there was more to that closet. Like little steps and then it kind of turned, so I thought maybe the chairs were in there. I went up and into this tiny room and there was a fucking, I-shit-you-not altar.\n\nNot like a \"yay let's take communion for fun\" altar, no judgement if that's your thing. It was this small table with a marble basin, some unlit candles, a knife, and a skull. Next to it on a shelf was an old looking book. Did not look like any bible I've seen, more like a really thick journal.\n\nImmediately, I got out of there and text my sister about where I was, what I'd seen, told her I would message her every few hours with an inside joke of ours so she knows it was me. I was convinced I was about to get sacrificed. I got the chair and brought it out, went back to cooking, kept a knife in my apron. Nothing happened that particular night with that, but I did accidentally walk in on their meeting after it started about a month later where they were chanting and then immediately paused to stare at me until I left. Then my boss, the company owner, followed me to the kitchen. I was so sure I was about to have my throat slit. He asked me to tell him what I'd seen, I said nothing. Asked what I heard, I said \"you were singing? Is this a glee club?\" Just fully playing the village idiot. He left me alone, but after that I was taken off that shift.",

Besides some lovely accessories, they don't really have anything particularly spectacular. Just a well decorated modern home, nice alcohol, business casual and a nice attitude. Most of our (probably) *verrrry* wealthy clients are like this.\n\nMeanwhile we also clean for some rather reckless clients. They are wealthy but don't have fuck-you-money. Their houses are usually messier and they are usually not that pleasant to us either. Nice cars, designer bags and glasses. Houses look great from outside but inside looks like the A-bomb was dropped. Once had a client open a package that was delivered, I think it was a watch but it was in a big box so it was hard to tell what it was. She said \"it's a present for my hubby, probably your monthly salary, right?\" She didn't even say it with malice, she just said it casually. Like, had she of said something else in the same tone it would have seemed pleasant. It's like they don't acknowledge that you're human. The worst bit is, whatever it was, was probably worth more than my monthly salary.\n\nBut she doesn't get 50% off DC shoes so she can suck on those apples.",

But just ‘wealthy’, not ‘superyacht wealthy’.  He is the eldest son of the family, so he comes to Canada for his university degree and the expectation is he’ll work a few years in banking before returning home to manage the family’s businesses. \n\nThat all goes according to plan, except after his business degree, he’s working the same meh entry-level banking job that I am. Which is a pretty solid job for 22-year olds, but about 16 levels below what his privileged family would expect someone of their social rank to get, since Canada doesn’t quite work like that (again, he wasn’t super-rich, or else it would work like that here too of course!)\n\nSo after a year or two, his family decides he should just come home. But he was never really the ‘wealthy-heir’ type and quite enjoys Canada and the low-pressure career he has embarked on (he was good at his job), and has even met a lovely (non-Muslim!) woman.  So he wants to stay, and secretly applies for permanent residency.\n\nA few months go by, and time is running out for his application. He finds out his family has been applying pressure to hold it up. After a fight with them, he gives in and agrees to come home. As far as he’s concerned, he is leaving Canada forever. So what does he do…applies for as much credit as he can and runs it to the max! And he gets a decent amount, since he has been in Canada for years, has regular income, etc. He maxes everything out, mostly buying clothes and renting fancy cars but also donates a bunch to our team’s social fund and a friend’s charity drive, as well as spending over $1,000 helping our coworker buy their schoolbooks for the year. \n\nHe puts in his resignation, we have a goodbye party, it’s all a bit somber and sad. The day before he flies out, he has another argument with his parents. Apparently his younger brother is also turning away from the family, and this has given the parents a softer approach…they agree to let him stay! He gets a visa extension, his family calls the local embassy and his permanent residency magically gets pushed up and approved.  It’s honestly a really moving situation, to see a conservative religious family really take a step back and evaluate things, and to allow their eldest son to go against their plans and pursue his own happiness. Our company allows him to rescind his resignation, we have another party to welcome him back, and he proposes to his girlfriend (married now for 8 years).\n\nSo everything is amazing, except the joker now has credit card debt that’s twice his annual salary! Apparently he was too ashamed of it to even tell his parents what he did, so it was all on him. So for the next 3 years, he had the most amazing suits and ties, lots of fancy customized stuff…and was eating ramen or canned tuna every meal.  To his credit though, he worked hard, lived frugally and paid it all off. Now he has a senior banking job, a happy marriage (as far as I know), and a strong relationship with his family.",

They're a bit out of touch with the realities of the world. I used to think that they were a bit naive too, because I saw a lot of other people taking advantage of them / outright robbing them.\n\nOver time, I realized while that's not untrue, it's more complicated. They did fail to notice a lot of... uncollegiate activity on the part of the people they hired -- but not all of it. What they did notice, they wrote off as the cost of finding people they could trust with projects that were *actually* important to them, and work with for years. So yeah, you could overbill them for a few thousand bucks once or twice, but if you worked hard and produced results instead, you could bootstrap your whole business to the next level with just them as a client.\n\nEventually, I realized they valued trust a lot more than they valued money -- they made their money with fairly long-term, high-risk, high-reward ventures running in parallel (e.g. research). So it all makes a little more sense now.\n\nI know plenty of rich useless people too, but... not very well. A lot of wealth is simply inherited in Asia, cashflow is a really difficult thing here.

The dogs slept on a huge, fantastically expensive leather sofa on the back deck, that had been replaced with a newer smaller version inside the house. \n\nThey were always renovating, and would ask me to dispose of the old furnishings. I asked if I could use some of them for myself, and was always told 'Oh yes, take what you want, and dump the rest'.  They only wanted the stuff gone, and I had their blessings to sell off and keep the proceeds. For someone earning less than AU$50K a year, this was a Godsend, and my tatty old house benefited from their cast-off rugs and furnishings so much. I was grateful and they were happy, and they had 100% faith and trust in me, which was mindblowing, especially when I was asked to take over processing the staff wages for the company. Unreal. Thanks Geoff and Helen :)",

The Ford mansion, Lloyd Carr, the one recent guy for Michigan football that I'm forgetting that also worked for Little ceasers. Edit: the name I was forgetting was Dave Brandon \n\nAnyway I got to see Dave Brandon's mansion- it was gated, deep in the woods, and absolutely HUGE. The driver (a 33 year UPS veteran) told me these guys with these huge mansions like this, they don't live there by themselves. Sometimes don't live there at all. They move their entire extended families in there. Parents, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. And they all live off the rich guys dime, ordering whatever they want whenever they feel like it. I think we delivered 30 or 40 packages there that one day. \n\n2nd story from the same day and with the same driver, we delivered to a smaller (but still huge) house with an extremely long and wooded driveway. The driver was cursing about how much he hated these people because they always parked this huge-ass boat in the only possible turn around point in the driveway. So he goes in backwards- and FLOORS IT. Maybe 40 mph BACKWARDS, about 250 yards of bends, straights, and he drove it absolutely perfectly, never driving off or missing the driveway. We get to the house and he needed a signature. He handed me the package and said he'll get the signature and just hand them the package and we'll go. Well, we get to the door, and this maybe late 40s or early 50s man, kind of a rick moranis/George costanza type of build. Short, extremely thick glasses, balding, but very skinny build. He's standing in the front door with a lab looking dog on a leash. The driver says, good evening we just need a signature and we'll be on our way. \n\nThe guy says... No. I can't I have to take my dog out first. This fucking guy was fully prepared to make us stand there and wait for his dog to do whatever business before just signing his name and letting us drop the package by his door. The Driver said, no we just need your signature, and we'll be on our way and you can walk your dog. The guy said fine and took the 2 seconds it takes to sign your name and we dropped off his package and left. \n\nThat left an impression on me. That guy valued our time so little it was worth less than his dog's shit. Like he was in his own world, and we weren't delivering 300 stops just before christmas",

I was confused as to why there were even pool floats out anyway, because nobody was ever there, but I figured fuck it; $500 for 10 minutes. I show up to the house and the woman's adult children were staying at the house with about 10+ kids between them all, and they were having a massive pool party/cookout. I awkwardly walked up and said to one of the parents, \"Sorry, it must have been a mistake, but I was told to come put pool floats away, but you're obviously here so I'll leave.\" Presumably the woman's adult son said, \"Oh, no, we're getting ready to leave. You can take them.\" Then he instructed the kids to push them towards me. I literally grabbed one inner tube float and 4 pool noodles, brought them 10 feet into the pool house, and put them away. I, confusedly, said they were all set and went to leave. The son thanked me and handed me a folded mass of $20 bills. It was $400. I was expecting $500 from my boss for payment, but I figured $400 cash was still overpayment, so I didn't mention it. The next day at work, my boss gave me $1,000. I told him the son had already paid me $400, which was fine.

His gloves were taped everywhere and his goggles had a crack.\n\nThe kids looked all Japanese but talked with him in perfect English with almost no accent at all. At one stage, they were talking about lunch time. One kid started showing his lunch money which was around 200$. Then all the kids started showing their lunch money to see who got the most. They did it without having any idea of how much money that is. Eventually they got the instructor and even myself to show them our money.

Most of them are alright and respectful to the locals but this particular kid, let’s call him J, made our life a nightmare for an entire week. \n\nA few of things J did: he pushed a kid into the water from the shore then blamed another camper, there are these ropes that we use to hoist up the sails, I think they’re called ‘halyard’ in English but not sure, J walked around and pulled one end of it up to the top of the mast on almost every boat, so we had to capsize the them on shore to get those ropes back down, it was a pain in the ass. \n\nOn the last day of the camp J approached us crying and informed us that he has the worst stomach ache of his entire life.\nMy boss escorted him to the clubhouse to call his parents and stuff and seemingly that was the end of the story. \n\nHaha, nope. \n\nJ was screaming in agony and demanded to call an ambulance. We did, the ambulance came, the doctors inspected him and he still wouldn’t stop screaming. A doctor wanted to administer him some sort of medicine through a syringe, and he suddenly stopped whining and laughed into the face of the doc and with the smuggest smile I’ve ever seen he said “I was faking it and y’all fell for it” and wouldn’t stop chuckling. Although the ambulance is free, when you call it as  a prank or just for no fucking reason you have to pay a lot.\n\nIn another camp we had an entitled bastard who threatened the other kids and the staff with a knife he brought with himself.\n\nAnd these are just the tip of the iceberg, I loved that job but it was a wild ride for sure.",

It took us a few days and when we were done we showed the owner our work, she walked out and said “You know, it just looks too perfect.” and had us tear it all down and rebuild to make it look shittier.\n\nAnother was some work we did for the owner of one of the largest asphalt companies in the Midwest. Dude lived right on the lake in a wealthy town. From his patio in his backyard to the shoreline was a hill that was sloped pretty decently down towards the shore at a 45 degree angle or more I’d say. One of the bigger jobs we did for him was having a raised flat section added in the middle of that slope going down to the shore. Kind of like a single large ‘step’ in the hill. \n\nThe entire reason he had us come in to add that was because he was tired of drunk people falling all the way down his yard when he had parties… Gladly paid the thousands of dollars it cost to get a full crew and equipment out there.",

Whenever i had to deliver to rhe Sango residential district i new i would have to drive far away just to not get tipped and get lost on streets and cul de sacs that looked like they were designed by Dr Seuss. The wierdest tipper was in the Sango district. I delivered to a road i hadnt been to yet, at the far north of the district. I drive through the floods of 2 story barby houses and then pull up to rhis giant, rectangular 4 story mansion. It had a road of its own theough the front yard with a fountain. I pull up and knock on the door. A very shredded 30-something year old black man opens the door in an embroidered silk robe. He had the, like, Gone With the Wind southern plantation owner accent. I dont know how to describe the accent, almost along the lines of DiCaprio in Django. He tipped me a 1$ bill and scientology pamplet.\n\n\nThat was almost 4 years ago and still havent experienced anything rhat confused me even a fraction as much as Old-Money, Scrooge McDuckian Terry Crews living in the middle of the upper-middle subrubs.",

They had a set of dog handlers that drove the dogs where they needed to be. The parents dogs were typically flown into the city from wherever they were staying, so they would helicopter the dogs off the yacht and then fly them back home for us to see them, then fly them back out. The handlers never really knew much about their history because their job was literally just to walk and drive the dogs places, so we would have to call different members of the staff to piece it together. The dogs had their own private chef that traveled with them, including on the yacht, and we had to send cooking instructions for their weight loss plan and for the one dogs allergy diet trial. They also had their own trainers that worked with them daily so they'd be perfect dogs for the family. It was weird because the dogs had more staff than our clinic..\n\nThe sons dog was a bit sadder - he stayed in the city all the time and had the whole set of staff as well, but his owner interacted with him a lot less because he was never actually in the city.. this was like a $10,000+ show line rare breed that he imported from France and it was 100% just a status symbol for him. We did find out that he has his own house. We asked about his living conditions because he has some seasonal allergies and the handler said \"well, he lives out in the dog house\" and we thought for a minute that he meant outside, but no, he meant this dog has its own *house* on the complex that he lived in, alone, and the staff would just go there to care for him.\n\nI don't know why they didn't just get their own vet to travel out to the yacht or come to the dogs house but apparently they'd been coming to our practice for decades. We did get a nice basket of really expensive baked goods each year from them.",

Mainly bridges, roads, eroding cliff sides, large development projects and state infrastructure. And because these scanners are fairly expensive ($80,000 to $200,000) we find ourselves also doing Feng Shui surveys.  \nSo we'll visit mansions that are on the market and 3d scan them for these wealthy Chinese clients. We don't actually do any analysis on the scans, we merely provide the final 3d product to their 'guru'. \n\nThe last place we went to was being bought by an overseas client. We spent a day there scanning, and maybe half a day in the office processing afterwards. As a surveying firm, we care about accuracy. Everything we do generally has a total error spread under 10mm. We were told to orientate the final deliverable to magnetic north, so we did our geodetic conversions and produced a very accurate, georeferenced 3D model of the building in full color. When we delivered it to the client they asked if we had orientated it to north and we reaffirmed that it is aligned exactly to magnetic north. Then they said \"Is that the google north? We just want the google north\" and so, after a small conversation we hand rotated the model to roughly line up with an overlay of a google maps screenshot.... And we got $20k for that job. So god knows how much the guru was getting paid for his tick of approval.\n\nOn a side note, that $30million mansion was a complete shitfest of a design. A big 'U' shape with an indoor pool and garage taking up the two sides, and a two story house at the base of the U that consisted of about 14 bedrooms. The empty space in the middle of the U was filled mainly by a useless fountain. The land parcel was about the size of a small town, so I guess there's still some value there.\n\nAlso, the client decided not to buy the mansion.",

We had to argue with them that we had to drive up to the house from the gate because we had tools and materials for the job they wanted us to do then but they didn’t want us to drive because there was a roaming Pomeranian and they were afraid we were going to run over. When we pulled up to the house, we walked past the helicopter into the guys room through a back entrance that was overlooking all of Malibu as all of the house was. It was a Middle Eastern dude, had pilot shit all over his room. Pictures and certs. It was like a 9-year-old’s dream but he was clearly in his 20s. Dope bunkbed at all. There was an 18 car garage.

A woman who's husband had owned television and print news and weather outlets hired us to build a reproduction iron fence around a late 1800s graveyard that they uncovered on a piece of property she bought. She fixed the entire place up and restored even the headstones that needed it. Most of the universites and colleges in my state have a school or building named after her as she donates large sums of her wealth. She was also the one if the sweetest most down to earth people I've ever met... They may be quirky but many of the super rich are good people from my experience.",

The outside front of the home had columns too, in line with that theme, so it looked a bit like a frat house.

We initially met because we were doing the roofing for the mansion he built for himself and his then girlfriend in a rather wealthy neighbourhood. After the building was finished, a few months later she decided that the pool wasn't big enough. So he bought the neighbours house to his left, hired an architect and a construction company, tore down the house that was standing there and build her a huge pool area to her liking. A few months after everything was finished they broke up. A few weeks later he had a new girlfriend. She didn't like the pool area. So he bought the neighbours house to the right, hired an architect and a company, tore the house down and build her a pool area to her liking while refurbishing the one he already had so he could meet his buddies there, having a drink and a BBQ while watching football games. Guess what? He broke up with this girlfriend even before the new pool area was done. Around comes girlfriend #3, they stay together, everything is fine, they even marry and she gets pregnant with his first child. Turns out she is an overprotective mum that doesn't want any hazards for their kids in their home. So he had to tear down the pools and turn them into a garden/playground. This happened all over the course of three years and cost more than I'm going to make in my lifetime.\n\nThe other one was an older gentleman, maybe late 60s/early 70s. He lived in a bogstandard row house in a working class neighbourhood and hired us to repair some roof tiles after a hailstorm in the area. Nothing, really nothing, screamed 'money' about him. He rather looked like a retired high school janitor. After we were done and ready to leave he gave us a €5 tip and asked whether I could come the next day to inspect some of his other buildings and give him a price for the repairs. Since it involved a lot of driving he picked me up at my office in a 20 year old VW Golf. The kind of car you'd buy your kid as their first car, because they're rather inexpensive but kind of reliable. He drove me from one building to the next. Malls, office buildings, supermarkets, apartment buildings and stuff. Turns out back in the day he was a rather successfull engineer holding several patents that are still making him big money from big corps. He was bored in his retirement so he started buying/building and renting out real estate. As a hobby. His kids all went to university without him paying a single dime for them. They had to work while studying and are now well off on their own. He told me he doesn't need any luxury or cares much about *having* money. But he enjoys *making* it. And donates what he doesn't spend every year. Needless to say, he is to this day one of our best customers. By now he isn't even asking for an offer, he just orders. And he still drives this old VW Golf and still wears the same worn out clothes. I even doubt he actually owns a suit since he is wearing the same shabby clothes to his topping out ceremonies, even when there are 'VIP'-guests present.",

They dial a number and we pick them up at the VIP elevator up to where the club has a gigantic wall window overseeing the top floor of the shopping centre lined with stores like Patek Philippe, VCA, Panerai, Breguet etc. There's also a lot of entry level brands like Prada, which has their own private club within their huge store as well. \n\nOther than the occasionally held private art shows or meetings most members visit when they tire of shopping for our afternoon tea, which they can spend their monthly membership credits on. I see mostly rich wife gatherings, but time to time a few bring their young boyfriends, sometimes to private rooms. \n\nOnce I overheard a conversation discussing the purchase of castles, and then of oil fields. Then, as I head back to the kitchen to bring them their 40 dollar coffee and cake add-on set purchased using Amex Black Cards I left wondering how they had just made multiple Cartier purchases as if picking up a few groceries, yet still seemed visibly upset that the coffee was non-refillable. \n\nAs a service job I didn't hate working there even though it could get busy and hectic just as any other place during weekends and holidays. Other than sometimes having a nice view of the scantily clad princess' butt cheeks who often visited alone I quite enjoyed the eye-opening experience. I learned that no amount of money could buy class or character. There are nice decent rich people, and there are stingy mean rich people.

            "text": "Oh man I have some stories. I used to work as a florist for a super high end flower shop in a very large North Texas city that only dealt with the richest of the rich. I was the mobile field guy and our shop had contracts with some of the ultra wealthy to send someone by every other day to their houses to freshen up or change out fresh flowers in their foyers, ballrooms, bathrooms, etc. To give you an idea of the level of wealth we did with, a certain owner of a certain North Texas NFL football team was on my weekly rotation, as well as a certain NBA team owner and “shark” was a common stop too. It was kind of cool, you were almost always just a fly on the wall in the lives of the rich and famous. Because I had to go to each house every 2-3 days it was easy to eavesdrop and chat and enjoy basically what amounted to a real life TLC reality show. \n\nFirst thing I learned, is that there is a **HUGE** difference between old money folks like the football team owner and new money folks like the basketball team owner. Old money people are super fucking weird.  They don’t talk to “the help” much and let their property managers or whomever deal with us, but they are so used to having staff around they don’t give a shit and you see and hear a lot. Everything is super stuffy and pompous. Everyone is so insanely obsessed with their social standing, who knows who and who has the nicest this or that. If one person on the block buys a new boat everyone else has to buy a slightly nicer boat, or if someone’s wife in the neighborhood gets a new Porsche everybody’s wife is getting a new Porsche. I shit you not, one time I was hired to do flowers for a BBQ at a rich guys house, he had some neighborhood friends over. I overheard some of the men arguing about what brand of luxury car one of the guys was going to get his wife because the others said once he did they would have to get one for their wives as well. Most of them are all unhappy in their marriages and fucking each other in every manner. Husbands hooking up with other wives, wives hooking up with other husbands, husbands hooking up with other husbands, bored wives or kids home from school hooking up with staff members or people that came through to work in or on the house. Staff members fucking each other. Just eveybody fucking everybody. It's super entertaining watching them all fight for social status and trying to act better than each other when in most cases they've all probably snorted cocaine off each other's asses and fucked within the last month. The more pious and holy a man in those circles acts the more certain it is he's fucking teenage girls, and the happier a woman claims to be in her marriage the more dirty damp and deep she's getting from every young pool guy and landscaper she fancies. A lot of the time rich parents will “strongly suggest” by giving or withholding financial help in return for compliance from their sons and daughters to marry each other to either keep wealth within tight circles or uphold some bloodline or stupid shit like that. So they will get married to whoever their parents want and then hook up with everybody else in the neighborhood. They also abuse prescription drugs like nobody’s business, they pop Xanax like candy and cocaine use is rampant. There is nothing like spending an hour trying to get some flowers done while some rich guys housewife hopped up on cocaine to try and get some relief from the boredom rants about her life for an hour. Basically if you watch Schitts Creek, the majority of old money people are like real life versions of the Rose family but with abundant access to cocaine, xanax and viagra. \n\nNew money people are typically the opposite from old money people. Most are super down to earth and treat you well, and live pretty normal lives, just with a lot more money. Some are super snobby and douchey but most are really laid back and chill. Like they have this attitude of fuck it, I made it, I never have to worry about anything again. They tend not to air their dirty laundry in front of the staff, and some but not all will chat with you. The new money folks tend to be a lot more frugal though, which is understandable. But I liked working with them quite a bit more. A lot of new money folks were focused much more on just enjoying being home and not working as much, so a lot of them had really cool hobbies and it’s interesting to see how normal people who get rich spend their money. One guy had an entire barn full of classic motorcycles. Another had the biggest LEGO collection I’ve ever seen anywhere, including the Internet. One had a massive home theater with a gigantic projector screen and every single video game console and probably every game ever made.  Most were really eager to talk about and share their hobbies, which was nice. New money people are always either happily married or divorced and in some stage of partying. The happily married folks were usually pretty calm but  the single and single folks had some wild events and scandalous drama that could compete.\n\nAnother complicating factor is that there is a very real and often physical degree of separation from most of the ultra wealthy and the rest of the world. In the city where I worked, the ultra wealthy lived in huge gated communities compromised of walled, gated complexs with multiple houses and guest houses on each property where the HOA required yearly proof that you had a bank account with at least $500k in it. These neighborhoods often have tall, sturdy brick walls surrounding them with a few hundred feet of gardens around the interior just so you have as little chance of seeing or hearing the peasants outside as possible. They have their own grocery stores, their own clothing and department stores, restaurants, bars, car dealerships, hairdressers, jeweler, schools, daycares, dentists, you name it. All with the same formula to cater only to the rich for every need and desire of day to day life without ever having to interact with the general public. They can go months or years without ever having to speak with or even be in the same room with someone from outside the upper class. For this reason a lot of them are very extremely disconnected with the real world and sometimes it’s comical, sometimes it was scary. Like, I would often get $100 tips not because they wanted to be nice, but they genuinely thought that $100 was just the standard tip for things.",

One time they wanted me to deliver and hang one painting at their ranch 4 hrs out of town (in Texas, so four hours drive and you’re still not half way thru the state). I get to a small town, and meet the family assistant at the only mansion in the small town. She says I have to follow her to the ranch because it’s “not available on GPS.”  We drive about 20 minutes out into nowhere, and then all of a sudden, a 16 ft tall, razor wire coated fence pops up, and goes further than I can see. Looks like a prison fence. We pull up to a gate, and drive into the compound about a mile on a dirt road, go over a small hill, the road becomes paved and ends at a cul de sac with four two-story, five bedroom McMansions, all with pools, and a lodge with what looks like an old diner made from train cars attached to it. There are also a lot of 18 wheelers being unloaded with trees and shrubs, and lots of bulldozers all over the place. There was also a runway and a heli-pad. I hang the painting, and ask the assistant what is going on here. Apparently the family wanted an African hunting lodge. They were scraping away Texas over 10’s of thousands of acres, planting African plants, and soon to import African wildlife. They were making a mini Africa in the middle of Texas! Like, they could easily fly themselves and their friends to Africa to hunt, but seeing all the poverty over there is probably kind of depressing, so why not just move Africa over here, and while you’re at it, have a diner so their chef can prepare the fresh kills.

So many of the details of that job are seared into my brain, now.\n\nWe were required to wear all white - white slacks, white polos, white shoes, white gloves, white belts. New gloves every week - *new*, not just clean. We had to change into the shoes when we arrived and we could not wear them outside. There were usually six of us and we each had a specific task (my job was vacuuming).\n\nEverything had to be vacuumed twice - once when we arrived and again after all of the dusting and linens had been taken care of. He demanded a very specific vacuum pattern on the second pass so that no lines were visible in any of the carpets afterwards. Vacuums were not to be emptied indoors, which meant changing shoes constantly. After a couple visits we ended up just stationing an extra person outside to do nothing but pass us equipment, empty trash and vacuum cannisters, etc.\n\nAll linens in the house were white and were changed twice per week. A separate company handled laundering them. They were all ironed/pressed prior to delivery and we were responsible for steaming any wrinkles out of them before we put them on the beds.\n\nAnd just in case you were going to say \"well, if he isn't there - just cut corners!\" - if he wasn't present, he had two observers who were. I think they were personal assistants. They always had digital cameras with them and would document every single room upon completion. \n\nThey were friendly, as was the client. And it paid well - in 1999 I was making $14/hr base plus and additional $26/hr for that specific job. And every single one of us got Christmas and birthday gifts from him.

The billionaire’s wife was a big conservationist and deep south Texas apparently mimics Africa pretty well.  \n\nI also went to ANOTHER ranch and got to check out the hunting “cabin” that had been used by the Bushes, among other famous people.  The “cabin” was very ornately decorated, with flatscreens EVERYWHERE, and the main room alone was probably twice the size of my house.  There were also smaller, regular house-sized cabins for the Secret Service and/or various hangers-on to stay.  There was also an attached, fully stocked kitchen that was manned 24/7 when guests were there.  Roughing it, indeed.\n\nFinally, on yet ANOTHER hunting ranch (this one had once been co-owned by Bob McNair, the late owner of the Houston Texans) I was asked about painting a 30 to 40 foot steel tower.\n\n“What is this thing for?  Is this y’all’s radio tower for out in the field?”  \n\nThe guy I asked looked at me strangely.  “Naw, this is our skeet tower.”\n\n“Do WHAT?”\n\n“Yeah, you see that big platform there?  We put a big automated skeet launcher on it and raise it up, then you go to the other side of that berm with your shotgun and we vary the height and number of clays shot over.”\n\nFinally, I think it has since closed, but the tiny town of Falfurrias, TX, used to have a Walmart.  They had a Walmart purely because one of the Waltons used to hunt near there and wanted to have a Walmart to shop in when he was there once a year.",

In the subsequent years he would get pulled out of retirement to come in and groom companies for going IPO, taking on a very active role in day to day operations for a few years and then exiting after they went IPO. He never took a salary, only a percentage ownership. When I worked with him he was on his 4th pre-IPO company. I don’t know that he qualified as “super rich” but his house had a full sized basketball court, with viewing stands, in the basement. He flew to Italy to pick out the stone for his wine cellar at the quarry. Flew the daughter and her friends to Paris to get a custom prom dress. Owned a Maybach and Ferrari, etc. \n\nThe most striking thing to me was actually how pragmatic (sort of) he was. He was rich and loved gadgets, so on a whim he decided he didn’t want to pay anyone to shovel the snow around his house (Chicago suburbs) so he tore up the sidewalk, patio, etc and heating coils installed. They were strong enough to melt like 8 inches of snow in a few hours. The first time he ran the system it worked like a dream, but then he saw that it cost more in electricity than he would pay for the entire season of shoveling — so he never used it again. It just wasn’t a good use of money.\n\nSame goes with the aforementioned Ferrari and Maybach, he found the maintenance costs to be far too high to keep the cars stored so he got rid of them. And settled for an S Class instead.\n\nHe didn’t have a personal private jet, but would rent them from time to time. Generally he said flying first class was pleasant enough when it was just him, though he’d never turn down the private jet when the company offered one. \n\nThe one thing he really splurged on was wine, one night I was there and we were going over a business plan I was working on and he poured me a glass of wine. It was too dark a red for my typically tastes, but I drank it. It was something like a 1992 Chateau Lafite — he was celebrating, because he had just sold 3 cases of it to a Chinese businessman for $120,000 and had a whole pallet left.\n\nWe’ve grown out of touch over the years as I ended up not starting the business he was helping me with, but he was a genuinely good person who had his fiscal eccentricities of course.",

You do some work, you explain how it works and generally you don't see them again.\n\nIt's the small millionaires that were the problem. They didn't have crews, they often lived on their boats, and they were not competent at anything past what ever they do that makes them rich, generally. They had the money for all the cool toys and gadgets for their boats. They could pay to have them all hooked up, but they lacked some understanding of sear-worthiness, the effects of the sea on the things inside the boats, and generally a total lack of technical knowledge we have all come to expect from boomers.

His dad was also some mega billionaire from investments and would work on projects with him. Needless to say, the job that I worked and generated him about $10k per month wasn't needed.\n\nAnyway, he sells his nice penthouse to build a mansion from scratch. Super nice house on the intracoastal along with a ramp for his 3 jetskis and boat. He lived there for about a year and a half before deciding he wanted a bigger house. Bear in mind he waited 2 years for this $2.5 million 6 bedroom home to be built just for him. \n\nBefore he sells the house, he decides his Ferrari is too much of a pain in the ass to maintain so he sells it and buys a brand new BMW M6 instead. Gets rid of his Ford Raptor to swap it for a F150 Shelby (this was when the Shelby had just released in the US and was highly coveted. He paid an extra $20k to get it early from a dealership 6 states away). He made that swap just because he felt like it.\n\nHis dad was initially going to trade his Rolls Royce for a Bentley but decided to just buy the Bentley instead and have both. My boss would also buy Marijuana by the pound and have it delivered to him. He did this quite frequently.\n\nMy boss' dad had a little better grip of money and wasn't as extravagant with his purchases as my boss was. His home was actually quite humble.

Our rates were $75 per hour and there were 6 of us there for weeks.  The owner was a contractor that worked with engineers to stand up high rise office buildings.  EVERYONE on the entire job for his house worked for big commercial contractors and EVERYTHING was custom.  There are more expensive and nicer houses out there... but what he built you'd probably think was worth 4 or 5 million back in 2004... but I think the final price tag was over 10.  All the trim was custom created, railings were sanded and 'artistically' welded.  The entire 1000 sq foot master bath was lined with Italian marble and lots of tiles were thrown away because he didn't like the natural pattern.  If you could ever tell there was a break in the trim where two pieces were joined he would insist that it get ripped out and new pieces milled in the garage, re-stained, and re-clear coated.  There was a gorgeous hood fan for the custom gas range with a price tag of over $10,000 which he decided was not good enough and needed to be replaced with an even bigger $20K+ copper one.    \n\n\nMy favorite... the garage had its own car wash (the kind where you park and the car wash moves around the car).  So every day, even in the middle of winter when all the roads were nasty and ice would build up on the car, his F-150 would be absolutely spotless.  And he also wore ostrich skin cowboy boots.

About half way through his set, the floor managers wrangled us up and asked us to wait in the kitchen, which was kind of annoying. \n\nTowards the end of the night, a very stressed, but excited, event manager was running around asking waiters and barmen to stay for another few hours. Turns out that the party was supposed to finish at 2am, but they paid the DJ something like £500 up front for two more hours, and hired us (albeit a skeleton team at that point, on double pay) to staff it.

Basically the story is, that this guy got uber-rich by selling his own fashion brand to investors ( like in the 9 digits rich) He had this huge boat that needs 3-5 crew just to be sailed (not talking about other  staff) custom built in the Netherlands, because his family where fishermen (Or long shore men or something ) and he had always wanted his own boat. He sails it for 3 or so weeks in summer with some old friends and probably a few other weeks throughout the year and that’s it. According to my friend the guy loves every minute of it, but since he has business to attend to doesn’t have more time. So you’d think, ok he sank a lot of money into an expensive toy that he enjoys but barely uses. But here is the kicker: since it’s not a showing-off thing, he rents the boat out which pays for the upkeep and the crew and he apparently already had multiple offers to sell the boat for significantly more than he paid for it, and there is a billionaire that basically made him a standing offer to buy the boat anytime he wants to sell it in the future for close to double what the guy paid for it.",

She won many small prize payouts and one day I found a ticket that paid her $3 million.  \n\nShe put the ticket in an envelope and called her driver up from the garage to deliver it to her personal accountant.  After he left the room I must have looked odd to her because she asked what was wrong.  I explained holding that ticket briefly was the most money I had ever held in my life.  She picked up the phone and called her secretary to come in with the petty cash box.  She reaches in and hands me a stack of $100s wrapped in a small bundle worth $50k.  She told me to take my wife and kids on a nice holiday or a cruise and that I deserve it.\n\nI used that money to pay off the remaining balance of the mortgage on my house.",

A pretty disgusting amount of it. The stark contrast I see between nonfamily employees and family \"employees,\" makes me want to walk out one day and never come back. They hire people on the basis of, \"we dont judge your drug addled past, we sell products and hire people like you because we care,\" but really its, \"no one else will hire you and we will pay you whatever we want and then pay ourselves a ridiculous amount to make up for it, but we will spread it around the different LLC's so that it looks like we're not paid that well to the IRS, and we'll use the companies money to purchase and fund all of our living expenses and toys so it's not categorized as income but gets seen as expenditures when we file our companies taxes.\"\n\nSo its generally the floor minimum for nonfamily employees, but if you get to be a favorite of someone, they'll pay you the living wage and expect you to be grateful every day for it. And don't expect us to honor your job description, we expect you to go above and beyond for several years before we grant you any compensation. You can deal with the crappy wage given to you during that time.\n\nFamily, however, they get to make triple digits almost as soon as they get out of highschool, or college if they're capable. But here, just so we can say you started from the bottom to garner respect, we'll set y out at 15 dollars an hour for the first month you work, its still 6 dollars more than nonfamily but youll get to say youve started from the bottom. And well pay for your car, rent, utilities, phone, bills, hoa fees, food, dog boarding, vacations, gas, and everything else you need because we need to spend all the company money on ourselves so we pay less corporate tax.

He didn’t have to and I always tried to decline his offers since I didn’t see him as a paycheck, but a person. On my last day working there, he told me to meet him at his car, and he gave me a large sum of money just because. I tried to decline profusely, but he wouldn’t accept it. He said he hoped one day it would be paid forward, in the hopes he helps accelerate my career or remove me from debt if I had any to get a fresh start.

I didn’t work for the parents directly, I work for a company that works with the health insurance to provide our services but it always baffled me how much the parents seemed to see me as a glorified babysitter. I provide therapy for one child and somehow was always taking care of all the kids, mom would step out constantly during session (it wasn’t required that she was there) to run errands because she would take advantage of her kids being occupied. they also had 2 live in nannies because mom said she can’t do it by herself (which I understand, kids can be a handful) But it’s always baffling to me to think about single parents who have to take care of their kids by themselves and she has two live in nannies and her husband. \n\nThe children have teachers coming and going, this is just an example and isn’t accurate times: art teacher at 1:00, piano lessons at 4:00, karate at 5:00 swimming at 6:30. I know it’s important to keep kids active and a scheduled day is good for them but sometimes I feel as if these activities aren’t just completely for them but also to show off their kids talents and range of knowledge in different things. \n\none time one of the teachers had said “oh you have a pool” and the youngest daughter (she’s like 6?) said “well duh of course” and I was just like… and then I forgot who but someone made a comment about their house and the same child said “we also have a lake house but it’s not that big”",

The lady had pics of herself with celebrities everywhere-the two I remember the most, though were Brad Pitt, when he had long hair, and her and Bono. \n\nShe also had a very messy room for such a well put together lady, which surprised me, and I dreaded going in there to clean it. Luckily, she was not there when I cleaned up, so I didn't really have to deal with her all that often. \n\nMy duties included laundry, general housekeeping around the castle (usually with a partner), prepping rooms for friends, family and guests of the lady, prepping food (one of her grandkids was celiac so we took extra care), and pretty much anything in between. \n\nOh, and she had an in home movie theatre with James Bond memorabilia on the walls, which, as a huge James Bond fan, was very cool. Never watched any movies there, unfortunately-I get the idea the theatre was mostly for her grandkids. \n\nI only really talked once with the lady of the castle, during Easter-she wanted a few people to decorate and hide eggs for her grandchildren, and I was lucky enough to have caught her attention and to be considered for this, I guess. \n\nThere was definitely a feeling of 'you are the servants and I am the master' going on, though, and I've never really encountered anything like this since. One such occasion was when were instructed to dress up to serve afternoon tea to Richard Branson's top shareholders (who were all complete arseholes, by the way). Not all of us could afford the clothing required, so I ended up having to borrow some. \n\nThen there was the massive party that ran into the wee hours of the morning where many people got absolutely drunk and harassed a bunch of the staff, myself included, and...yeah. Rich people seem to have such a sense of entitlenent, and this was an absolutely shining example-one of the girls I worked with quit after this due to the repeated harassment that night, and...I'm guessing it was more than just harassment, sadly.  \n\nI'm pretty sure the castle was also haunted-I was cleaning the set of rooms the grandkids usually stayed in, and while walking down the hall back to the kitche  afterwards, I had the kdea that something was running at me-I glanced over my shoukder to look behind me and didnt see shit, but the hair on the back of my neck stood up and that feeling intensified. I ran like hell out of that section, and ran into the maintenance guy, who took one look at ne and asked \"You felt it too, huh? Don't worry about it.\"\n\nDefinitely one of the strangest, yet interesting places I worked at.",

He used to host \"bible study\" at his office but it was actually just him and a bunch of his rich buddies drinking beers and doing lord knows what else in his office after after AFTER dark.  \n\nThey treated pretty much everyone like they worked for them as well.  My wife went to drop some gatorade off at their house for an upcoming soccer game for their kids and they expected her to take it in, take it out of the plastic and cardboard, find a cooler, fill it with ice, and put the gatorades that would fit in the cooler and put the rest in the fridge.  She sat it on the counter and left instead.\n\nThey also had loopholes for EVERYTHING.  Dude had a super fancy European luxury sedan that he managed to keep dealer plates on because he co-owned a car lot where they would buy this car with dealership money and not re-list it until he was ready to sell it.  So it was technically the car lot's car, but he drove it as his own.  They also had a handyman that did work on some properties he owned and he would pay him over invoice from his business accounts to do work on his personal properties.  Everything was a workaround to cost them as little from their personal accounts as possible.  Meanwhile his 5 employees each made like $50k with no benefits and only  a handful of PTO days a year.\n\nWhen they did spend though, they SPENT.  He wanted to build a house in one of our cities \"social status\" neighborhoods.  Where the professional athletes and other famous people live.  His lighting budget; not his electrical budget for the whole thing and not any labor costs, just fixtures and bulbs; was $150,000 in cash.  They had marble flown in from some remote corner of the world and when the wife found out it didn't come from the specific exact pinpoint destination she thought it was she had them fly out more.  They paid for it all in cash.  They bought the daughter a brand new F150 with cash the day she got her license and she totalled it on day 2.  They bought her a brand new Range Rover with cash to replace it.  \"Less blind spots and better safety features.\"\n\nSpeaking of his daughter, she freakin HATED them.  They were definitely trying to buy her love.  She just wanted to be normal and being THAT rich made her an outcast.  The biggest intra-family fight I ever saw was from their family and it was over Donald Trump.  He came to our town and they're as close to a megadonor family as you can be without being a billionaire so they got to get close enough to him for a handshake and a \"God bless you and God bless America\" from him.  Well, in a surprise to no-one, he took a shine to their 16 year old daughter.  He wasn't \"indecent proposal\" levels of inappropriate but he touched her hair and face and told all of them that she was \"beautiful, so beautiful.  God bless YOU *touches face*.\"  Like slightly-too-touchy-grandpa, not \"grab-em-by-the-p.\"\n\nWell, the daughter HATED it, and the parents LOVED it.  When they were telling us about it she got so embarrassed and angry.  She literally said \"you would've sold me to him if he offered!\"  They just said \"he loved you so much!\" and \"he's the PRESIDENT, you should show some respect!\"  She literally punched her mom and spit on her dad and got in her range rover and drove away and disappeared for days.  It was nuts.  When she got back they sent her to some place tropical on their jet-share to make up for it.  They disowned her after she voted for Biden.  We don't talk much since January.",

Well I grew up on a rez and rich has always been a non quantifiable term. \n\nAt the time rich to me was not having to check your bank account before you went grocery shopping. I was getting into the industry to do inspections on the equipment for these companies. \n\nSo anyways we meet at some casino, and I always played slots..never craps.\n\nThis guy was teaching me how it worked. It is important to note that he wasn't using chips either, they were ceramic rectangles and not round....I didnt think anything of it.\n\nDidn't look.at them either as I was paying attention to what he said. So he says you think you got it now? I said I guess, and he pushes them all in front of me while the pit boss is watching and he nods at me and him.\n\nSo rich dude said its your show...win the house. Then walks away with my dad. \n\nI start betting on the pass line and winning.  Stacking these little rectangles up until I loose a hand.  Went like 8 times where I won. I toss the dealer a rectangle like a baller.....she looks at me and says Thank  you so much.\n\nI didn't think anything of it, and go find him and my dad, and say I played till I lost...he laughed and said you lost it all? I said no way, and handed him the chips back...he said na you keep them.\n\nI was not having that, and said they are yours, he smiled and said ok but you keep this one. Put one in my hand...think it was purple and white, but cant remember. \n\nWe go to leave and I go cash it out. She hands me a form to put my deets on like social security number and name kinda shit...I said what is this she said that anything over 1200 has to be reported as income...I said how much is this then....she pulls a band out and says 10k sir......I shit a purple ferret. I was in a high limit room come to find out betting 20 to 30k a roll and handed him back over 150k.\n\nI got the money and went back to the door where he was and was all hush hush whisper saying you gave me enough to buy a goddamn car! \n\nHe laughed and said so? You earned it kiddo.....I never took his money again but watched him go to the same casino later and drop 500k on a single hand of black jack, to lose it and he didn't bat an eye. \n\nHe had a son that was his world, but grew up in the life and got hooked on heroin to OD in Gary Indiana one day....I met him once and he wasn't a dick, but that life of excess just fucks people I guess. He and I talk still, matter of fact I bought him dinner recently to pay him back as when I was on the road during my early days I was penny to penny and he got my lunch as it was that or gas in my tank to keep warm when I slept in it...sacrifice to make a LLC people.\n\nHe gladly took me up on my offer and said that he was proud to see me making it from where I was 2 years ago...I used the money he gave me to start my LLC and fund the account to open under its name. It is all still there as well in case he needs it back. \n\nShowed him too because I never did feel right about getting it, and said I can give it back. He recently stepped down from that company to make it employee owned as well. \n\nNow he just drives around the usa seeing where he ends up.

            "text": "I’m a Realtor in Seattle, was helping a student of UW that was from Japan find a condo for in the area. Nice kid, good English (believe he was in the Medical Field). One of the times I met with him, I accidentally handed him the wrong folder which contents were for a very wealthy Facebook executive which had about 4-5 different houses all atleast $3mm. He opens the folder and says he wants to check one of the properties out (in my experience, he’s wasting our time as he said he was only looking for about $800k). He’s a nice kid and it’s not far away, so I agree and we go check it out. The minute we step in to the backyard that’s overlooking Lake Washington, he says “how much do we need to offer to get this in contract today?”. I am in shock as I assumed his dad was just buying him a condo to live in while over here for college. I ask him how he would finance it, and he says “give me a minute”. Comes back 5 minutes later and shows me an email from his father with a screen shot of his bank account - this was an entire list of bank accounts (maybe 15-20) with the account number crossed out. The lowest amount of money he had in 1 of his accounts was $9MM. \n\nNeedless to say, we bought the house and a few weeks later he calls me and says he needs some help, can you come over? Which is an odd request, but this kid just brought in about 20% of my yearly profit, so I have to go. \n\nI walk in the house and he has a couple of his neighbors in the house. The kid greets me and says “we have all come to an agreement of terms for the sale of my neighbors homes” - all the neighbors smile and said “all we need you to do is write up the contracts and we’ll give you a 1% commission for each house”, just for writing up the contract. Of course, I agreed and brought out my laptop and started gathering info that they had previously agreed upon. The neighbor on the left of the house he previously bought had agreed to sell his home for $3.6MM, and the neighbor on the right had agreed on $4.9MM (he had just completely remodeled his entire home). I write up the contracts and we send it over to escrow and go about our business, I later asked him why he was buying them and he said the remodeled house was for his parents to visit and the other house on the left is for Family to come visit. They had just spent $11MM in 1 month just for a place to stay a week or two a year. I still help him buy 2-3 properties a year where they just buy in cash and don’t do anything with it, and just let it sit. Obviously frustrating with the housing crisis but I know where my breads buttered.",

With my boss' crazy demands needing to be met, I had to alleviate this woman's irrational concern the only way that made sense - lie to her and tell her that the network I was installing used equipment specifically designed to not use the same kind of wireless signal the other cheaper ones do, so her kids wouldn't be impacted at all. She bought it, and the install completed and my boss was happy.\n\nFor anyone who hasn't worked in IT, trust me when I say that trying to explain to her that wifi doesn't harm childhood development was not worth the headache; people like that never believe the logic of worker bees like us.

He made $500m in the late 90s dot-com bubble by selling a way overvalued consulting / ISP business at the top of the market. He started this new company after a few years of retirement on an island because he wanted to, in his words, \"prove to the haters that it wasn't luck and I know what I'm doing.\" It wasn't until after I got in there that I found out he hired an old high school friend with no experience to be the CFO, and everyone else in management were just sycophantic yes-men. It didn't matter what someone's official capacity was in the company, they just did whatever he said. The woman who was \"head of HR\" would be asked to baby sit his kid in the middle of the day, the recruiting manager would take his car to get detailed, etc. \n\nWorking as the director of IT, I was asked to spec out and order a gaming laptop for his kid, and one time he flew me down to Atlanta and back in the same day to install a new wireless router at his friend's place. I used to update and troubleshoot Quickbooks on his home computer, so I could see a lot about his financial situation; his personal burn rate was crazy! Tons going out, not much coming in. \n\nMy other task was to register domain names. He owned one name which was actually highly coveted, and he had been offered $1m for it, but he turned it down thinking the price would only go up. He'd email me weird made up words he thought would be worth something and had me keep a spreadsheet of them, how much he paid, when they'd expire, etc. Words like \"prescotix\" or \"dyntagic.\" There were about 40-something of them and he was just sitting on them waiting for someone to make an offer.\n\nBut by far the strangest thing I ever had to do came when the market crashed in 2008. He went from having a net worth of $350m to about $30m. He was freaked out. At that point he owned three $1m+ sports cars and a house on St. Barts.  The house hit the market first. Then he was selling his cars. One of the potential buyers of the cars, who I later learned was Ralph Lauren, wanted to know if the interior could be changed to a different color. The guy asked me to take pictures of the inside of his car and photoshop it to make several copies featuring different colors that he could send to the potential buyer.\n\nThe one thing I still have from that job is one of the \"First 50\" Chumby devices.

My dad used to contract and paint houses for the rich and famous in LA in the eighties and my favorite story of his is having to cut a car half mount it to a wall and match the paint from the car to this room 3 separate times because “it didn’t quite look right in the evening light”. The owner of the house was….Prince.\n\nAnother crazy one he had was having to dig up an actual lake for some guy in the desert and organize the transport of tanker trucks filled with water, because he wanted to be able to jet ski there. \n\nOne I personally have is a good friend who married into a wealthy family of pharmacy chain owners in South America and decided to have their wedding in the states. Flew in basically everyone including a famous band from their country and the grooms favorite DJ from Europe for a set at the end of the night. Super down to earth nice people though. \n\nI also went to college in LA and had 2 separate friends whose parents straight up bought them condos or houses close to school so that they wouldn’t have to commute far, eventhough they normally lived 45-50 mins away in traffic. And another one who was literally only going to an insanely expensive school to get a degree that had nothing to do with what she wanted to do to satisfy her dad to then get him to finance her pursuing her other dream. Contract and all lol. \n\nI have a few more stories cause LA is well LA but overall I’d say it was always a mix, chill down to earth people with insane amounts of money that never wore anything flashy. And the crazy spoiled out of touch obnoxious assholes. 🤷🏻‍♀️",

He had to find something else to start collecting, so he decided to start a collection of antique engines.\n\nYou know those giant, old timey engines that usually have one giant wheel and don't do much other than just sit there? It's those. And they can quickly start getting into the hundreds of thousands of dollars price range.\n\nI found this out because the father of a buddy of mine is also into these engines, and I guess he's kinda well known in the giant old timey engine community. So one day Jay Leno was able to get the man's phone number and called him up to talk antique engines. And like most people who receive a random phone call from somebody claiming to be Jay Leno, he thought it was some kind of bullshit prank. So he told Mr Leno to fuck off and hung up on him.

Essentially, she was a \"society lady\"; she spent her time on charity committees and day-drinking. (It took me a while to realize that wasn't iced tea in her glass in the mornings.) I was in charge of generating and tracking invitations to events, since she wasn't all that computer literate. I only really did any work when she was watching me, though, and as soon as she left for lunches or meetings I'd just goof off online (via dial-up, lol; even though I was broke I had high-speed internet before she did). \n\nHer husband had made a lot of money as a producer and was mostly retired, though he still kept an office -- I think mainly so he wouldn't have to be at home all day. I heard her tell a friend on the phone once that she & her husband would probably kill each other if they had to be cooped up together all day, which is hilarious given that their house was the size of a museum. The entryway had one of those double-spiral-staircase thingies. Every surface that \\*could\\* be marble \\*was\\* marble. The basement had a screening room as big as one of the smaller theaters in the Drafthouse. Outside there was a tennis court (which I'm pretty sure was never used), a gazebo, and who knows what else. \n\nFor her husband's birthday, she wanted to surprise him with a new Jaguar; I had to call a bunch of dealerships to find out what they had in stock that day. (They already owned two Bentleys, so a Jag would have been kind of slumming it for them, but whatever.) \n\nOnce, I watched her husband pay their staff (a husband & wife who did their cooking & cleaning) by opening up, literally, a box full of money. It felt like a scene from Goodfellas as directed by Nancy Meyers. \n\nThey were friends with a lot of other rich people who were more famous. I was assigned to drop off a package at Aaron Spelling's house. Didn't get to go inside, but even just being able to see past the iron gate was pretty stunning. \n\nVirtually nothing about their lives and lifestyle was appealing. They were doing all the performative rich-person things and, as far as I could tell, enjoying none of them. When Christmas came, they hired someone to come decorate their tree (\"I can't imagine decorating my own tree,\" were her exact words).

Oh boy, do I have some stories but here’s a preview.\n\n1) At a clients house when their teenager comes in the kitchen and talks to us (a really well raised kid honestly..respectful, polite, etc). They ask how our trip to Yosemite was and we chat a while before I mention: “Your mom said you guys just got back from a vacation in Italy. That must have been awesome! I’d love to see Italy some day..”\nThis kid no shit looks at me confused and says: “ Vacation? I mean we were only there for five days but….Um…yeah..I guess it’s like a vacation..” The oldest daughter went to some expensive art school out of state for over $100,000, graduated, and moved back in to make $5 bead bracelets. (Which I’m not knocking.. I just think it’s weird to pay over $100k to learn how to make a bracelet and her parents LOVED to mention this all the time) Parents bought her a brand new Mercedes and she totaled it three days later into a few brick mailboxes while texting a driving then got a brand new BMW the next week paid in cash. Basically all their money came from the husband who dabbled in the stock market and had several articles done on him regarding him as a stock market genius …he pisses in the kitchen sink because he doesn’t want to walk down the hall to the bathroom and has underwear that looks like he wipes it in mud. When we told his wife, who kept complaining about the sink smell, that he was pissing in the sink she thought it was funny and said “yeah he don’t like walking down the hall. he’s a character ain’t he!!?”\n\n2) At another clients house. Had built a good relationship with this couple who worked for BMI records. Totally cool people and we had been cleaning for them for a few months. They bought a new house and wanted us to clean it so we did a 8 hour deep clean in this new construction home. We’re headed out the door when the couple shows up with two moving trucks + movers and the husband wants us to stay longer to clean up what the movers track in. They never told us this before an 8hr deep clean day in 95+ degree weather. We say we can’t and this dude flips his shit on the movers instead of us. Tells them this is all their fault for not bringing “booties” or something to cover their feet. He walks into the house screaming “LOOKS LIKE OUR NEW HOME IS GOING TO BE COVERED IN DIRT RIGHT AFTER WE PAID TO CLEAN IT!! THATS MY F***ING LIFE!! THAT. IS. MY. LIFE!!” He started walking around inside so I couldn’t hear fully from outside but when he was saying the word “booties” specifically his voice would crack and was pitched at all different levels like a mad man. Almost like saying the word pissed him off but he just had to keep saying it to feed his anger lol. Complained for about 30 mins about paying for movers who “aren’t smart enough” to know he paid someone to clean his house first….?.. Their kids where like children of the corn. The daughter ran to the bathroom my fiancé was cleaning and just stood there before running and telling her mom she can’t go to the BR because “that girl is in the way” She argues with her mom and says she don’t want to talk to my fiancé to get her to leave the BR. Mom gets mad and demands the daughter go pee. Daughter comes to the BR door and my fiancé says “honey I’ll leave so you can use the bathroom.” Kid doesn’t speak and just stands there pissing on herself in defiance. It then made sense why all their clothes and the washer smelled straight up like pee 24/7. Then we noticed her school sends her home with freezer bags of piss underwear because she does it all the time. Nothing wrong with her just spoiled and bratty. \n\n2) At another client’s house cleaning before thanksgiving. Their family was in town and while they spent they day out we cleaned up. An electrician was there installing a dimmer switch and then left about 10mins after the family left. We’re upstairs almost finished up for the day when the family comes in. We hear “GREAT!!” in a very angry sarcastic tone before we hear repeated smacks against the wall and the family gasping or saying “oh my god, Peter!” (Husband) then the wife starts crying and we’re upstairs like wtf just happened. I’m nosey as fk so I go down there and Peter had seen the light switch wasn’t finished so he smashed it into the wall and was now laying on the couch holding his head saying “all I wanted was a dimmer switch” while the wife was crying and saying “This is how we live..” to his mother and father visiting. broke my heart for her but we awkwardly wished a happy thanksgiving and left. Later on found out that the electrician had to leave because his family lived in Gatlinburg while the fires were tearing through the mountains and he couldn’t get a hold of them so he dropped everything and drove straight there. \nFound this out when Peter told me “I called that POS electrician and he told me (starts to make a mocking imitation voice of the southern worker) my mommy and daddy is scared of them there fires and I hav ta go make sure they is smart enough to know that fire hot! Must escape fire!”\nNever went back to them after that comment.\n\n3) Cleaned for one of the biggest writers of the music in Disney channel movies/shows and hands down is the worst human I’ve ever met for MANY reasons. They owned five houses around downtown that they rented out for Airbnb and their personal home was one of them. We’re cleaning his house one day after guests leave and I find a bag of women’s underwear sort of hidden underneath a closet gap that I only found by sticking the vacuum hose under it and it sucked up a part of the bag. \nI honestly didn’t think anything of it. Figured I found his wife’s diet laundry and left it in the hamper. Few months later we are cleaning his studio in the back when I find the bag again on a pull out mattress opened and showing all different sizes and types used panties. Red flag goes off that this dude is a panty sniffer but whatevs, some people are into weird shit. If he wants to sniff his wife’s underwear than that’s their deal, ya know? Two weeks go by and we come to clean again and run into the guests who are busy looking for something before they leave. The boyfriend is now waiting to leave while the gf is looking in all the drawers and the laundry room.I tell them whatever they left we will mail back to them and the bf laughs then says “Oh she can’t find some of her underwear and a bathing suit so if you guys find it just throw it away” sort of just shrugging it off. Then he asked if we came in while they were here and I said no we only clean before/after and he just goes “hmmm.”\nThen it all made sense. We had another guest ask us the same thing, if we had come in while they were here. The Disney writer was coming in while the guests were out downtown and taking the women’s used underwear….",

I'm talking about a whole room, stadium seating with custom premium full grain leather theater chairs that cost more each than a used honda, 5 figure projector in the back beaming to a 250\" screen, sound insulated wall panels, etc. The average person's home value in a single room type home theater. The thing that got me was the $10K old school pop corn machine. It just blew my mind that anyone could see a $10K popcorn machine and have so much money they could justify $10K for it. We sold a bunch of them. it wasn't a one time thing. it wasn't anything crazy, just really fine materials and hand made craftsmanship. every lever and button was super nice billet aluminum or stainless. \n\nWe had this one big mansion out in the boonies. I was apprenticing under a OG, learning how to chase wires through walls and shit like that. The thing i always remember is to get to the big theater room, we had to walk past the kids' bedrooms. they had a young teen daughter, and judging by them being in the boonies on a huge property with a 5 minute long drive just on the driveway, the jesus stuff everywhere, and the $$$ i assume she didn't get out much. i was late teens, worked out, and had full sleeves so in her sheltered jesus world i was everything she was not allowed to do. She was not subtle about it.\n\n\nSo what does she do to impress me? To catch my eye?\n\nShe knows when we're coming, so she leaves her door open and makes sure i hear her favorite chorus from her Linkin Park CD. Every.Single.Time i walked into that theater room it was her just beyond the slightly cracked door and \"craaaaaawling in my skinnnnnnn\". It was obvious. the OG started laughing about it every time. I know for a fact she's a grown woman now and will lay awake at night cringing about that week she was 13-14 trying to impress a guy almost twice her age with her linkin park CD. She probably realizes how stupid and dangerous that was as well. \n\nEvery time i hear linkin park i think about that rich little princess, trapped in her castle, crawling in her skin. I hope she enjoyed that baller ass home theater. Dad put over $100K in late 90s money into that thing. she probably cracked a window and made the whole zip code hear her teen angst anthem.",

I once did a job that was just basically a rich people social event inside a hanger at my state’s airport. The event was hosted by a company that sells private planes to the people who could afford them, and this was just basically a “hey thanks for giving us business” event for all their past, present, and future clients. There were multiple things at that party that just absolutely blew my lower middle class mind. \n\n1. Each guest flew in on their private planes, landed directly on the tarmac 100 feet in front of the hanger where the party was happening, and they left the same way. \n\n2. There were a few private planes inside the hanger that were mostly just for show but had price tags on them. One guy had a few too many drinks and decided his private plane wasn’t enough, so he wrote a check and bought another right then and there. \n\n3. There were also super cars there for the same reason as the planes, one guy wanted to start up the McLaren and give it a few revs but accidentally put it in drive and scratched the hell outta the passenger side door on a table, said fuck it I guess this is mine now, wrote a check, had it delivered to his house in Monaco.  \n\n4. Much to my boss’s dismay, I found myself chatting up a guy who worked in Miami. Total Rico suave type, think Miami vice big business guy. Forgot what he does, but he makes a lot, and he wanted me to work for him. I politely declined as I had been going to school here and couldn’t just up and move to Miami. At first he thought it was a money thing, so he wrote me a check for $5000 to get moved and set. Again I politely declined and mentioned this time that I had school, so he told me to keep the check and use it for school. Gave me his business card and told me that if I was ever looking for a new job to hit him up, he’ll get me set up with a low 6 figure salary on the spot. \n\n5.

Many of their higher ups were members and would bring guests to dine.\n\nHad one guest request her chicken medium-rare (I can only assume to impress the person that brought them). Another asked for her steak “Pittsburg” and complained that it was undercooked (a Pittsburg steak is basically burnt on the outside and raw on the inside). Said it was supposed to be medium-well…\n\nOne of our members liked to drink white wine mixed with Dr. Pepper. It wasn’t the cheap white wine either\n\nOverall, it was very interesting to see the mix of people born into money vs the ones that made their way into money.

It sure felt like he thought I was more of a slave than a partner.\n\nI dated this super rich guy for 3 months this summer (worst idea ever)- and boy did I learn some bizarre shit about how they live.\n\nLike, apparently, after he’d get wasted and do too much coke at horse races (who goes to horse races?!?!), he’d have a nurse come over the next day and give him a saline IV for his hangovers instead of just drinking Gatorade and taking Tylenol like a normal person. I know that the service cost several hundred dollars, but he didn’t tell me how much exactly.\n\nHe was in his late 20s and his mom still bought all his clothes for him.\n\nI don’t think he’d ever lived without a maid cleaning up after him-He dropped a glass in his room and broke it and didn’t clean it up for two months because he legit didn’t know how to clean anything.\n\nHe didn’t do his laundry for 6 months (he had *that many* clothes), and then I had to help him pile like 10 garbage bags full of clothes into the back of his car and take them to the laundromat, show him how to operate the washers, etc, and then force him to put them away so they didn’t just sit in a pile taking up *literally* half his room (The pile was bigger than his bed)\n\nHe was so sensitive to any sort of discomfort that he would act like he was going to have a panic attack if he was required to have a direct conversation about any sort of conflict, even minor issues like calling the internet company about an outage. \n\nSometimes I had to order for him at restaurants if it was something more exotic than steaks and hamburgers. He’d just make this pleading, panicked face at me - He was so used to having things done for him he didn’t even know how to ask for help, And he never thanked anyone. It was expected.\n\nHe literally didn’t know basic shit about life like how to apply for an apartment. I had to help him and he didn’t realize you had to ask questions like “is the water included in rent?” He didn’t even know what was a realistic amount of money to pay for rent.\n\nHe ended up drunkenly sexually assaulting me and then ghosting me, and when I ran into him two months later and was like “what the fuck dude?!?” He said he’s “not required to acknowledge someone who’s spoken to him in an angry tone.” and his texts to me sounded more like a PR release than the way you’d speak to someone you dated - I’m 99% sure he paid somebody with legal background to help him write them. He told me he had done that before in another incident when he got in trouble for something in high school. (He didn’t tell me what it was he got in trouble for.) I wish I could hire a PR agent every time I did something stupid while I was drunk.\n\nI didn’t even want to out him or report him to the cops or anything, I just wanted him to apologize and acknowledge that maybe he needed to stop being so fucked up on Addies and booze all the time because that’s how this kind of shit happens. He said I was being unreasonable and it’s not his fault because he “didn’t experience it that way”.\n\nHe called it a “mental health boundary” to ghost me after he assaulted me because he “couldn’t handle the stress” of being held accountable for his actions. I think I might’ve actually been the first person who ever told him to his face that he did some thing wrong. His attitude was just “well, it happened, I don’t know what you expect me to do now.”Generally that was how he acted whenever he upset someone or made a mistake.\n\nHe thought that his family was “middle class” because they didn’t own multiple yachts like his neighbors, and would argue with normal people about that being unfair. Like, his family had a big ass house out in the county and multiple vacation properties, but he *needed* us to know how hard it was for his dad to not be Jeff Bezos.\n\nWe had a really embarrassing (for him) conversation where I had to make him look up the median income for the United States, at which point he realized his family was in like the top 3% of incomes in the country.\n\nHe moved into this warehouse I live at (that’s how we met) pretending to be broke (He kept a second 2 bedroom apartment in a really nice neighborhood that was like $2000/mo) because he knew people wouldn’t like him if they knew he had a rich family and he “wanted the life experience”. He was basically LARPing as a poor person so he could feel like he understood how real life works.\n\nI didn’t know until two months into dating him how well off his family actually was (he hid it), and he would go on rants about how it’s actually way harder to be a rich kid because your parents will be upset if you date poor people. He wanted to hide me from all his rich friends and his family because he thought they were disinherit him for dating me. \n\nHe had one of those expensive $500/hr psychs that would tell him what he wanted to hear and prescribe him anything he asked for - he was frequently strung out on Adderall. I mean like, he was being prescribed three times what anybody who actually needs it as prescribed, his psych was clearly just pay for play. It would have been way cheaper to just do meth.\n\nHe also armchair diagnosed himself and all his rich friends with autism so he could claim that all their sociopathic behavior was because they had mental illness, and therefore nobody could be upset at them for acting the way they did. Generally speaking, for him and his rich guy friends, mental health was an excuse to act how they wanted. For everyone else, any sort of mental health issues meant that we were insane and not to be taken seriously, no matter what we said.\n\nHe insisted that his life was the worst because he didn’t have to do anything to survive, and he could just drift through life, “his existence was meaningless”, and therefore “he had it way harder than everybody else”. He’d often cry about it to all of us (Mind you, this was during the pandemic when most of us had just been fired and people in my building were being evicted for missing rent)\n\nLike, this guy had really convinced himself he was a victim of society and it was our responsibility to let him act however he wanted because it was so hard for him.\n\nWhat a piece of work.

Together they were valued at $7 million (probably much more today). I was allowed to bring my video camera and film everything as long as I didn't touch anything. I (being a teenage boy) was in heaven and couldn't help myself. When else was I going to have the chance of touching the leather seats of a Lamborghini Diablo? Despite his amazing collection of cars his every day car was a 10 or 15 year old Ford Explorer.\n\nThis guy at one point owned Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (the car from the movie) and it was on display at a restaurant his son ran.

His wife had some health problems so every single door on the property had those handicap buttons where you touch the button and the doors open automatically.\n\nBeing that it was an elite private golf course, membership was exclusive (maybe 200 members).

They sold their home in Ross and where building a new one on top of a hill in San Anselmo overlooking a valley and hills so they purchased a temp house that was likely priced in the low millions to stay in until building was done. We were having dinner together in the temp house and he made a joke about it “being a dump”. They all thought it was hilarious. Oh and this was around the time AirBnB started cracking down on hosts declining guests on race. In his mind this was a direct connection to “well poor people steal more so they should be allowed to discriminate.” Yeah….it didn’t last long between us.\n\nI worked for a billionaire who has adult kids. One of his sons and I have a mutual friend. To this day, the billionaire who I’m still in touch with has no idea that his son (and I through our mutual friend) know about his secret children in another country.\n\nSame guy’s daughter is getting married the same day as I this year…coincidence. Difference is my budget is $15,000 and hers is up to $800,000 and counting. She decided 12 weeks before the wedding that she “doesn’t want a wedding but a house instead”. I’m sure he’ll  just get her the house too.\n\nSame girl has her LA beachfront home, car and all bills paid for 100% AND an allowance about $10,000 month. She charges her fiancé rent. Poor bastard has no idea whats going on, nor what he’s in for. \n\nShe’s driven away from gas stations with the hose still in the car at least twice. These are the things that happen when “the help” runs life for you.\n\nThe best part about families like this is the wives allowances. His wife’s is about $30,000 a month. Several times she has purchased a single item of clothing over that price. Then she bills her husband for the extra cost. Yes… she literally sends an invoice to the family accountant. His reactions after finding out are priceless. \n\nBoth sons were asked to have their wives sign a prenup less than 1 week before the weddings. That didn’t go over well….\n\nOh! One of the most common things rich people like to tell the lower class: “Just work for yourself! Start your own buisiness!” Yeah, people are parenting your children and living with YOU because they can afford to start a business, let alone pay rent in the area…\n\n“I didn’t see a live black person until I was 23.” - I don’t know why they share these things with me.\n\nHave you ever been in a home where every room has a theme? One was jungle, one was tech/futuristic, one was Roman marble and gold etc. \n\nI’ve been paid hundreds to sit and do nothing for hours. I’ve also been told “a small business” can’t afford xyz pay & benefits by people who own multiple multi million dollar estates. \n\nTre Cool is a fun & courteous guy who grows very yummy tomato’s in his yard. We met at a restaurant I worked at and had a friendly night out with live music and drinks. He was engaged soon after and texted me asking me to get him on the books at the restaurant to bring his lady the same night. I did so, and asked my boss to send them dessert on me as a congratulations because I wasn’t working that day. Next day, I found out they didn’t send the dessert. I asked why. I was told it was “inappropriate”. Apparently hanging out with pop stars makes women in monogamous relationships pants fall off.

I remember vividly how he would get stacks of 100's for an allowance each month, and he would just dump them into the nightstand drawer.  It was easily over $500K at any given time.  Anyone of his friends were allowed to go in and take what they needed.  But no one took advantage.  I also remember how his dad would have his butler call him up to invite him to dinner.  He hated this the most.  He would throw the phone and scream \"Why can't my father call me directly!\".   He wanted my family to adopt him, he adored my mother (but he'd probably miss that allowance)   He would  wear Black Sabbath t-shirts and sweats to Sotheby's auctions just to piss off his parents.  They were so pretentious.  I enjoyed seeing how the other half lived, but it was so strange to see the lack of love and interaction within the family.  He was always unhappy and ended up on drugs, which broke us up 3 years later.",

            "text": "I don't exactly cater to them but my great uncle and aunt are fucking loaded. They have two IDENTICAL houses in different parts of Toronto, which is already a stupidly expensive area to buy a closet in, and not only did they buy the houses, they were *custom built*. When we told them we were looking for a house to rent at the beginning of Covid they were just like here take this house, and let us live in the second house for free. The house especially stood out because it had been built right next to a bunch of normal sized houses. It was by no means a mansion, they had a limited space after all, but it was much taller then the others around is and wider too. Inside all the furniture was white which made my mother super paranoid and she immediately covered them so we wouldn't ruin it. The kitchen table had a glass top and the floors where made of very dark wood which always showed even the slightest amount of dirt on them and we were constantly sweeping. \n\nIt was also filled with the strangest decor. A huge neon framed image of Marilyn Monroe in the same room as bleach white couches and glass tables with futuristic metal candle holders. Metal table decorations that looked like maces and one like a dick. There were so many windows too. The dining room had windows all along two of the walls that went from floor to ceiling. My room had three floor to ceiling windows as well with no curtains overlooking a street so the first thing we did was slap curtains on that. I also had a square walk in closet so that was an interesting experience, my clothes didn't even take up half the closet. I ended up moving to a new school and when my classmates found out where I was living they all got super excited and kept asking what was inside. They had all watched it while getting built and then watch it be empty for *two fucking years* before we came along. One of my great uncles kids asked us how we were enjoying the \"party house\" while we lived there. \n\nThere was multiple sets of furniture stored away too. When we arrived I was showed to an area filled with different bed cover sets and told I could pick whichever one I liked. There was never a piece of furniture we couldn't find. None of the rooms had lamps in them so after a small expedition we found enough lamps to light the whole house with just lamps. There were so many miscellaneous items in that storage space to decorate with. I will never forget the wall of just decorative pillows.  \n\nThey also have a third house in Lebanon that has so many floors they need an elevator to go around the house. It has multiple living rooms and multiple formal sitting rooms. There are two kitchens on different floors and more balconies then I can count. One of the dining rooms that was only ever used once in our entire stay with them at the Lebanon house had these pillars surrounding the table that were really thick with flat, reflective, glass on the table facing ends that where filled with china and glass sculptures. They also had a spiraling staircase that was used to traverse the three main floors and get up to the attic. It was this stone marble-y thing that was very slippery if you had socks on and there was absolutely no railing. It was just a drop off. I feared falling to my doom every time I used those stairs. \n\nWhen we went to Lebanon we also got to meet some of our cousins (I didn't bother asking how in the world we are related at some point you just accept that maybe everyone in the middle east is your relative). They also had a multiple story house, and happened to have three young children. One was four, one fourteen, and one sixteen. They had two nannies, and the kids had these little remote things that could call the nannies for them, like a bell but digital. A lot of the nights the adults where out and the kids would all be left together with the nannies at the cousins house. The fourteen year old had a wall that was just a bookcase, and he admitted to me he hadn't read over 3/4 of them. He had so many books I was dying to own and didn't even know the plot of them. He had a play room that wasn't like, just a play room, it was *his* playroom, and it had a huge tv that he played Fifa on. All three boys went to private school obviously and were surprised my siblings and I attended public school. The fourteen year old was planning on going to a football summer camp that cost more then our trip there. The family hosted a dinner party once, where they took us out to dinner, and then had a second dinner at their home. They had this huge tray of sushi except I'm not sure they knew exactly what sushi was because it seems they knew the gist and guessed from there. It was wrapped in seaweed but the inside was like no other sushi I've had before. It was disgusting but maybe it's a rich person thing. Most of it was thrown away. Seeing all the excess in Lebanon made me really sad honestly. All if it was so pointless. \n\nAnyways, that kinda got off topic but yeah, it always amazes me how they live and how money is never a barrier for anything for them. Oh yeah and they have Picasso paintings in the house they live in. I can't believe I forgot that. My brother commented on the nice painting they had hanging on the wall in the front hall and my great Aunt just casually goes, oh yes it's Picasso.",

They’ll drop $25K on a trip or something without hesitation, but then they’ll feel personally offended when an employee asks for a $2K raise. \n3. They don’t know how to do basic technological things because they’re so used to paying other people to do it for them. (This doesn’t apply to all rich people, but soooo many are like this). \n4. They’re surprisingly frugal in some ways. For example, I saw a CEO try to haggle with a mechanic who told them how much it would cost to repair their car engine. I remember cringing because I had gotten similar repairs done a few months prior and actually had to use my entire stimulus check on the repairs, but this super rich person was trying to haggle a $1000 repair down to a few hundred dollars. \n5. They typically barely work. Most rich people, especially rich business owners and executives, have hand-picked a self-sufficient team so they can do the bare minimum and rake in the money.\n\n\nETA: I re-read this and realized I didn’t tell many specific stories.

She smacked my hand and announced as if I was stupid “No, I want to suck on the bone”. She proceeded to do so for another 10 mins or so before I could clear the groups plates and suggest desserts. \n\n\n2. I was a nanny for a about a year for an ex of an actor, let’s call her Lisa. I watched her 2 kids (boy 9 and girl 7) as well as the 2 kids of her boyfriend (girl 14 and girl 5). \n\nI’m going to explain the house because it’s revenant to the story…. \n\nThe house was a more than decent size with a detached building next to the pool what held storage, a gym and a live in space for their old nanny (I didn’t need this accommodation so it was left unused). \n\nThe main house had the master with attached bath, 2 kids rooms with shared bathroom on one side of home…. \n\nthen a Living room with back covered patio with small space on one side that was accessed from a separate inside door in living room, a large kitchen with breakfast table, separate unused formal dinning room in center space of home…. \n\nThen on other side was a laundry room, 3rd bathroom and a large garage for kids to play.\n\n There was also a very very large upstairs that I was only permitted to go up to once with a big space next to stairs used as a closet for used once pricy clothing, and behind a closed door (never saw behind) was a much larger space used for Lisa’s office (this was above the whole center of the home). \n\nNow guess where she accommodated her 2 “step kids” in this spacious home? \n\nThey both slept in the very small separated back patio (with wall not sealed from rain) that could only fit the 2 twin beds (barely any room between them) and one dresser.

            "text": "The amount of people who think they know billionaires astounds me. There are roughly 500 US billionaires. Research states that people will make roughly 400 meaningful friendships in their life, given that the average person makes it to the big 1B mark in there 50s they have roughly 200 friendships left in their billionaire days... This means that there can only be 10000 people who are/were friends with billionaires in the us. Take out those who have either died, or are billionaires themselves and youre left with a few thousand folks in the entire US who can claim they are/were friends with a billionaire. If you peruse Reddit however you are constantly seeing swarms of people claiming to know or be buddies with a billionaire. Lol\n\nIts laughable because its more likely that you played in the NFL. (to date over 25,000 people have played in the NFL...) The reality is that everyone has a rich friend and while you may think he/she is a Billionaire, I can almost guarantee you they are not. Perspective is everything. Relative to where you are at in your life you know people above you and people below you. Giving the perception of being a billionaire does not take much. You can easily convince someone you are a billionaire with simply having a few million in the bank. Most folks in america live off credit. With 10M dollars you can make it look and feel like 100M+ by using margins, credit cards, loans, and collateral. Dont be fooled by your friend who bought a brand new Lambo and claims they did in cash. People lie a lot... They fly you on a private jet and they conveniently call it \"their jet\" when they own 1/16th of a time share on it or are just chartering it for a day. Then they fly this jet to a vacation home and call it theirs but they have a mortgage on it for 12M$ or are just renting it out for the weekend. They'll show off their fancy watches they bought with their credit card and ignore that part, theyl tip huge amounts to make a show of having extra but its usally just a few thousand... \n\nI digress, my point is simply that giving the appearance of a billionaire is not very difficult to do temporarily. Especially if you are showing off to someone not in the 1% it doesnt take much to make people think you are rich. But the reality of the situation is that they almost always have massive debt/loans. Theres really not much more to buy after having 100M, so maybe youve met someone worth a few hundred million at best, but like I said, there are 500 Billionaires in the US, so when I meet people who loosely use the term when describing their rich friend I ask for the persons name because I call BS. 10/10 times the name will not show up on the forbes list of Billionaires. now I know that list is incomplete but its telling to continuously show people that their rich friends are nothing more than rich.... Not billionaires.",

I was working as a freelance virtual assistant back then when she messaged me with a proposal. She was looking for a personal assistant, and the pay she was offering was insane, 30,000 pesos (around $600/month) and all I had to do was stop her from spending her money. For a bit of a context, her family was like a \"mafia\" but in a good way? idk, but this might sound weird. Their family would buy illegal drugs and firearms and dispose them to \"clean\" the society. On the other hand, their family had certain people who were assigned to hunt down r\\*pists and get rid of them. Just the r\\*pists. Those were the only things she shared with me because knowing too much won't be good, she said. In short, they are rich as fuck. The money she had was given to her by her grandfather to help her start in life. She was just in her 2nd yr of college at the time. and the money? 3 million pesos. Knowing how irresponsible and immature she was at 18, she hired me to help her.  Idk how she did it it, but this is how my work went. Every time she would attempt to withdraw money from her account, I would get notified, and I had to call her, ask the reason for the money and convince her not to spend it unless it's for medical reasons. That's it. That's all I had to do for $600 a month. It just stopped when she graduated from college. We had been good friends, but she said she can't be friends with me because she wanted me to live a peaceful, long life.\n\nThat experience made me realize that rich people really can get what they want with money.",
