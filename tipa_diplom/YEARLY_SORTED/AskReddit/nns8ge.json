External factors are at play too . Like being emotionally hurt by rejection due to lack of knowledge regarding how to behave , and this on multiple occasion . Lack of self awareness about what is good or bad behaviour and choose ( often the wrong , creepy one ) , constructs into this kind of fucked up situations in which individuals just speak their minds regardless of consequences . \n   How i know this ? Self analysis . Because i am trying to heal some emotional wounds of my own . Don't take it as a defense for these people , only trying to explain that this creepy behaviors aren't adressed or talked about in a loving / understanding manner , but more with fear and/or hate . \n   Conclusion ?

At first it was a bit more lax, but then she took a very unexpected turn. After talking only for about 2 days, she expressed to me how she has “visions” of herself dying, like if she’s on the road she has a vision of getting into a car crash or something of the sort. She said she would see her own body, dead behind her in the mirror when she was in the bathroom. None of it struck me as true personally, which I felt more reassured about after getting to know her more, but I told her she needed to see help as this isn’t really something a completely mentally sound person should be experiencing. She somewhat brushed it off as if it wasn’t sort of response she was expecting. Not sure what she was hoping for, since we barely knew each other.",

I did my own thing and worked on developing good relationships with some of the associates. Some annoyed the shit out of me and I only spoke with them just to make sure I didn’t come off as having favorites. Well there was an associate who was an older short female who was put in the fitting rooms cause she wasn’t fast enough to handle the customers on the floor. \n\nOne day I’m walking around the store and I see her putting some clothes left in the fitting room on the floor. I walk by and say hi and she struck up a conversation about how she appreciates me being so nice to her. I could care less about her but I decided not to be rude and spoke back. After a few sentences the conversation died and we fell into a weird awkward silence. After about 3 seconds of silence she says the most out of left field thing she could’ve said...”My husband died a few years ago.” ...well needless to say I was shocked to hear that. So I said the usual “oh I’m so sorry to hear that.” She then says “yea...he killed himself.” At this point, I’m cringing and getting annoyed at the same time. I legitimately did not have the social skills to deal with this. So I say “Oh my god that’s horrible.” She then hits me with “Yea...I found him.” At this point I’m just trying to check every filing cabinet in my head trying to see if I could muster up a somewhat reasonable response. I reply with “Wow that must’ve been horrible. Is today the anniversary or something?” She just nonchalantly replied “No.” At that point I didn’t know how else to respond. I have a code with my friend where if we text each other watermelon emojis, the receiver has to call the sender and act like something is wrong to get us out of whatever situation we’re in. After she told me she found him, I sent my friend those emojis. After the final silence he called and I stepped away. I practically ran back to my office and didn’t leave until after she clocked out. \n\nI never thought I could get hit so hard with such cringey awkwardness at one time. In my opinion, I think she was trying to get me to evoke sympathy and comfort from me since she knew a lot of people got fed up with her performance at work. All she really did was add another person to that list. I’m so glad I don’t work there anymore...",

I joked that I had a couple of times and when she asked if I was serious I told her I was joking. \n\nI asked her the same question and got a different reply than I expected. She told me she didn’t want to talk about it and then after an awkward few minutes of silence she told me a story about how she was driving on the highway and there was a car accident up ahead of her. She said wasn’t paying attention and ran into the accident scene in front of her. \n\nApparently the accident was caused by a drunk driver and someone was ejected from the car. Also apparently she ran over the person ejected who may or may not have been dead already. The problem is that there was no way to prove it after the fact because the person was very clearly not alive. \n\nShe was arrested at some point and eventually charged with “driving resulting in death”. She explained in detail about how hard it was dealing with the trial and the stigma of the entire ordeal and how it was portrayed in the news — and how hard it was for her family. \n\nI dropped her off at work shortly after that and told her it was fun and maybe I’d see her around. After a day or two of minimal response from me she told me “maybe I shouldn’t tell people that story on the first date”.  She was sweet and I was younger and less mature so I wish I was more straight up with her but she was right — it definitely wasn’t first date material.",

(Our lease is almost up so we'll be able to move soon, thankfully) \n\nHusband and I are SUPER introverted and we have an (almost) 8 year old little girl. \n\nThe other households are not our type of people. We're not prudes by any means, we're cool hanging out with people we gel with but the other households are all older and (to be honest) toxic as fuck. \n\nThe first time I met my Neighbour two doors down from us, she was wasted. I'm talking staggering and slurring her words wasted. \n\nI was playing with my kid in my fenced off garden and she just invites herself into my yard, opens the gate, tries to stagger towards my kid, I call my kid to me immediately telling her to back off.\n\nSide note - IDGAF if I offend adults when it comes to the safety of my child, I am that type of momma. I will throw down for my kids safety. \n\nShe recognizes what she has done, paints a weird fuckin smile on her face and tries to introduce herself. I send my kid inside quickly and ask her what she thinks she is doing just opening my gate? That's rude. \n\nShe watches my kid run inside and says \"I'm a mom too\" \n\nSo I go, \"okay, please get out of my yard, I didn't invite you in\" \n\nShe then starts repeating \"I'm not a bad person,\" over and over again and I firmly tell her to leave. \n\nMy husband recognizes that something is up, he steps outside and this drunk bitch starts ambling towards him repeating that she's not a bad person over and  Over again to him. \n\nHe's softer than I am and goes \"nobody said you were but you need to leave,\" \n\nShe then goes, \"my children were taken from me, I'm not a bad person, please don't hide your little girl from me I won't hurt her\" and my hackles went up. \n\nI shouted at her to get the fuck out of my garden and to not ever come back - the Neighbour that is immediately next door to us Heard the commotion and realized that she was missing a party guest and comes up to the fence, seeing what's going on she starts apologizing to me blaming the drinks for this woman's bizarre behavior and managed to get the woman out of my yard by tempting her with more drinks.\n\nThat is how creepy Tanya got her name. They tried once after that to get husband and I to join them for a braai (barbecue to anyone who isn't South African) by knocking on my back door and greeting me with that creepy fuckin smile of hers but my face does this thing where it mirrors what I'm thinking, but so does my mouth. \n\nI told her that we are not going to be friends and to please never come near us ever again. That she made me incredibly uncomfortable and that was it. I shut the door. \n\nImmediate Neighbour tried to talk to me about it saying \"oh she's a sweet person\" but I shut that shit right down and told her straight, she can be as sweet as sugar, but we are adults, I'm not obligated to give this woman any of my time. \n\nI still have no clue how creepy Tanya lost custody of her kids - and it may not seem like a big deal to some but Guys, this is South Africa, you have no idea how bad things have to be for the government to step in and take your kids. \n\nI was severely abused (part of the reason why my hackles went up around this woman)  and they didn't take me so I cannot help the ominous feeling I get when I think what the fuck this woman must have done to lose her kids. \n\nThen on top of that, to drunkenly approach my kid?! My gut feeling is usually right, it was a survival mechanism growing up so I usually listen to it. \n\nCreepy Tanya can stay the fuck in her corner. She has not tried to approach us again. I think she learned.\n\nEdit: fixed a spelling mistake",

            "text": "Hooo fucking boy. I've got a story that has stayed with me for over 20 years and still gives me a fright every now and then.\n\nThis was in the year 2000 in India. I was sitting with a bunch of friends at about 2300 on a saturday night- they were drinking beer, when one of them decided that they wanted to smoke pot. I hadn't yet had a drink, so it was only logical that i drive.\n\nSo one of the dudes i didn't know that well daid he'd come with me, and we took off. Buying weed in India is a risky affair, and it gets sold only in the shittiest of places. This particular day, we struck out at the regular dealer, so we decided to go some other place. No luck there either.\n\nThat's when the guy with me says he knows a place to get some- cool. Turns out his place was a fucking cemetery in one of the shadier parts of town. Fuck. But big deal- let's go.\n\nSo we ride halfway across the city to this fucking cemetery. I am not liking the look of this shit hy this point, but there is hardly anything i can do now, is there? So we tip the fucking security guard to let us in and we he tells us to go the the far end of this giant fucking cemetery. Double fuck. I don't know how many of you have been in Indian Cemeteries, but they're spooky fucking places. Overgrown with giant fucking trees and inhabited by junkies after dark.\n\nSo we ride past what appears to be all the junkies in the city, only to find out that the dealer is sold out. Motherfucker. Motherfucker. As we're standing contemplating our fucking luck, we see another couple of dudes off to one , huddling over a bike. They're young, seemed chill- so this crazy fucker eith me decides to ask them if they know a place. Like i said, they were chill dudes. Tell us that they came to the cemetery for coke, but have weed back at their place. By this time, it was 0130, and the frustration had set in. Against my better judgement, i listened to my companion who wanted to go to these guys' place snd buy the weed off of them. \n\nSo- another 20 minute ride later,  we reach what is a bad, bad part of town. Not somewhere you want to be seen after dark. You're a target for thugs, cops and any lowlife. We follow these guys and go into street and gully after tiny lane and come up to a ratty, half demolished apartment building where the guys stopped and got off. Triple fuck. Motherfucker- every one of my nerves are beghing me to get out of there. They tell us to follow them to their apartment and we go.\n\nWe get to an apartment that is a fucking crackhouse. No lights, no fans, no air conditioning. The place is reeking of human sweat and piss and failed dreams, though i can't see a single human in the living room. They tell us to follow them into another room, which we do- and, fuck! About 15 individuals are in that pitch black room, surrounding a couple of open bottles with candles in them, shooting up heroin. Godddamnit- why me? I don't even smoke weed, for fuck's sake!\n\nMy night takes a turn for the worse when my companion decides to 'chill out for a few minutes' with these dudes, at their invitation. This is the middle of a crakchouse and i cannot argue with this shit. I could've killed my fucking companion at this point. I swear to the fucking lord, i can still taste the bile rising in my throat when he told me that. Motherfucker.\n\nSo i am sitting in a chair in the fucking dark, surrounded by junkies shooting up heroin. It turns out these guys don't know each other. The house is just an open invitation for anyone with some heroin to come shoot up. In about 15 minutes, everyone there is high as a motherfucker, when someone new walks in.

I ignored them and asked him what was the point of that.\n \"Well, I just want to let you know that it felt nice and I recommend you trying it.\"\nAfter that \" quick conversation\" my mom suddenly called me home to do my homework (which I think was a good thing). I did ask him again when we knew each other for longer, he said that it was meant to be a joke and didn't think I would take it seriously but I think the joke went way too far.",

She also implied sexual assault, but she didn’t elaborate and I didn’t ask. Her father was in the house when she was abducted and didn’t know. That got him into depression, which as a result wasn’t really there for her during the recovery. She was in her late thirties. She also told me that when she hooks up with guys, and they touch her throat, she feels choked and screams. It was a first date, and at that point I decided that she is more than I can handle. After rejecting her, she accused me of punishing her because of her trauma. This was followed by many angry texts into the night. I felt bad for her obviously, but I’m really happy I dodged her.",

            "text": "I wrote a comment already but remembered I have a way better contender. \nIdk if counts cause I actually did a quickie marriage to the guy and in hindsight what he said to me... I should have taken him seriously.\n\nMet up with an old classmate I had a crush on. We hit it off instantly. We married 3 weeks in. At 2 weeks in we had been doing the deep talks. He admitted to murdering a man on an Indian Reservation in another state away. (My defense, I thought the guy was blowing smoke up my ass to look like a bad ass cause I had mentioned that I tend to fall for bad boy guys. Hard slap to the forehead on that one).\nHe told me a few details I would remember later on when I realized he wasn't lying. He claimed that the particular reservation he was on basically was the mob. He was \"ordered\" to kill this guy. Talked about how he took him to a dry creek because it was about to pour down raining the following week. \n\nSo we marry quick. I'm not even going to give excuses on why I was so dumb, other than I was lonely. 4 month anniversary he put his hands on me the first time. I kicked him out. I'll take mental abuse all day, but physical abuse is where I draw the line. He came back one week later and strangled me. I died. I have the brain damage to prove it. He beat me on my back until I came back coughing up phlegm. \n\nAfter he took off, freaking out at what he did, I got my kids and myself packed to leave our house and I spot his wallet next to the bed. I decide I'm gonna take a look because I knew he kept his social security card in it and I didn't know if I would need it for the impending divorce. I took it out and his ID and another ID fell out. On the second ID it was a man with blond hair and the ID was from that state. I panicked and put it back. This rush came over me and I stopped packing and just took what I could. \n\nCouple of months later, I couldn't get the ID off my mind. The chills I had that day came back. That's when I realized I never once checked the name of the man. (That's actually in my top 5 ultimate regrets). I began googling reservations and that state. I came across 2 separate counties that seem to match the details of the story. I called both county sheriff offices. The first one put me in touch with the second county I found because they happened to have a missing man of my description. I worked with their detective for a couple of weeks and it actually seemed like it was a hit. They couldn't give me too much info about the case, but the story and details I was telling them were matching up. \n\nUnfortunately, I never did find out the results. You see, my ex was still looking for me, so my kids' grandmother had offered me a place to stay in her home in the state that this reservation was at. I ended up changing my number and so those officers couldn't get a hold of me. Here's where the chills come back and I'm feeling them again as I type this; it took 2 weeks for me to realize that I moved to the exact County that I had talked to months prior. The town that was miles away from my kids' grandmother's house had an reservation just on the other side of that town. \n\nThere was one time when I was chit chatting/flirting with a sheriff deputy and I brought up the story of before I moved there, how I talked to their detective about that case. I did it with hopes of that deputy going back and talking to the detective and maybe he would want to talk to me again, but I never did hear anything back. Never talked to that deputy again.",

Started working security at a place where you’d be there 12 hours then another guard would come relieve you and start their shift. I was new and the relief was as well. Never spoke to him in my life before and within 2 minutes of him showing up he was telling me how he gives his wife hell in bed and she has a helluva pussy. I mean sex talk is one thing but to tell that to a stranger and to do it so quick and so graphic was very odd to me.\n\n2. Met a friends mom, who was a druggie but so was he, and literally the first thing she ever said to me was “Want to see my pussy?” I was like 15 and kinda nervously said no thanks. She started laughing and said “I’m showing you anyways” then proceeded to show me a cat tattoo on her arm. I laughed but was super awkward. Like it’s not a horrible joke but again the first words to ever speak to someone being a pussy joke seemed odd to say to a young teen. \n\n3. Started working at a warehouse and within 2 hours of meeting this dude who liked my pantera hate asked me if I wanted to step out and smoke in the car. We couldn’t smoke on the ground but was allowed to if we stayed in a vehicle. I said yes and we went out to smoke when he pulls out a prescription of Xanax, pops 2 in his mouth, chews it up and asked me if I wanted a few. I knew it was half bars and I’d taken them before so no way I’m working on them. I say no and we go back to work. In another hour he’s leaning on the pallet jack and stumbling around. Boss finds out and tells him he has the choice to take a drug test and get fired or just quit right now. He quit, not many bosses would help his future out by giving a choice not to be fired.

She confided in me that she watched her boyfriend (might have been fiance?) pull a gun and shoot himself in the head in front of her.\n\nShe also told me how she and her best friend of years, someone I knew for a very short time, and her had been urban exploring on a smoke stack catwalk in an abandoned paper mill and she watched her friend miss a step and fall to her death.\n\nShe wasn't making these things up either, the next day I mentioned to our mutual friend that she had opened up to me about this stuff and he confirmed it was sadly true about the boyfriend committing suicide. The accidental death I had known about through [the news](https://www.nj.com/hunterdon/2016/09/woman_20_who_died_in_landfill_fall_had_traveled_th.html), I didn't know she was the person with her though. Poor girl witnessed the loss of two very important people to her and at the time she was only 19-20 when she told me this. I hope talking to a near stranger helped though, even if all I did was listen.",

I forgot her name and still feel horrible years after as I would've loved to let her that I know and that if she wanted to go to the cops, I'd be there to tell 'em what he confessed.

He (machine gun guy)quickly reacted and opened fire, only for them to find out he had gunned down a little girl who was around 9 or 10 years old who had pushed open the door to her family’s house.

Super fucked up, I know. \n\nHe also told me insanely brutal and gory stories about other fire fights and hand to hand combat situations. I didn’t believe this dude was lying for a second, the way he looked, his eyes and the way he talked about how he became so accustomed to killing on regular basis that he felt like he was going through withdrawals (from killing!!?) when his tour was over.  \nHe eventually went to a lot of counseling and started his own family and has become a (seemingly) normal-ish dude, to everyone else at least. \nI’ll never forget those stories and how they still send a shiver down my spine whenever I think about it.",

You do not need to come if you feel uncomfortable”.\n\nI did feel uncomfortable but I felt bad about not going.

On her very first shift she came out and told everyone that the toilet was clogged and someone had to go fix it, because she had anxiety. We were like, wtf, and she kind of laughed and put her hand on her head and said something like, \"this is so embarrassing, but I'm bulimic and I had kind of a big lunch and I didn't realize the plumbing was so bad here. I don't know anything about plumbing, or where the tools are and it's pretty embarrassing so I think you should do it\". What.   \nPardon me. Did you just... Oh. okay then. Change the subject.  \n\n\nOn her next shift, she began giving orders to other servers, to the bartender and the support staff to do things. She had to be reminded her own log-in code three times, but felt the need to comment on how cocktails should be made. And worse, she was wrong about half of her suggestions, so everyone was third-party embarrassed... correcting her about anything meant you would have to prolong the discussion, so people just bit their cheeks.  She reorganized parts of the restaurant nobody asked her to, and then complained about having to put it back when the manager asked her why she was disorganizing the restaurant on the clock?. She was straight up cunty with people on the phone, low-tippers and even the owner. She was pretty, and seemed normal enough, until you spend time with her. She kind of looked like Ariana Grande when she was a Disney tv starlet, but short and a little thic. Nice big smile and soft voice, but utterly insane. Imagine, on your second day at work telling the woman who's been there 20 years that she's not doing something correctly; balls of steel.\n\nI asked if she wanted to stay for a drink after work, at which point she accepted and then walked out on the bill, which I covered. She told me she had to run, because she'd signed up for a Sugar Baby's account and was meeting with a potential client and hoped this would work out, because she was behind on rent and she only wanted to fuck ballers. We were not on those kind of friendly terms, we had probably talked about where she'd worked previously and her hometown and then Bam. More things nobody asked to know.\n\nSmile and nod, but I'm just like what. the. fuck.\n\nOn our next, and final shift together I show up to see she is eating two entire plates of food. Like, entrees. She may as well have dislocated her jaw like a trap door, thrown her head back and dumped the plates. This was pretty awkward because a week ago she'd announced to everyone during the meet'n'greets she was a raging bulimic and an escort, and here she is eating roughly my 36hr caloric intake in a single sitting.... and I'm not cleaning up her mess again. So I just straight up asked her, not necessarily in my indoor voice why she was eating so much if she'd just told everyone she was going to throw it up.\n\nShe laughs and says, \"Oh, well I decided to go back to being a chubby,\" and I was like, alright cool but... can't you just not binge-eat and not throw up and love your body and be healthy? These extremes are a little disturbing. She laughed some more.  \n\"No no, it's not about body image or anything, it's just that I've got some new clients and a business model around seeing how fat I can get\".   \nShe then went on into glorious detail about how lucrative it can be for a camgirl - my old manager was a camgirl and made 6 figures in a year as an entirely average-looking girl, and I don't judge, so I was like, alright that's fine. But then she described, in all too graphic detail how many pounds she was projecting to gain per day and how folks were already sending her hundreds of dollars in tips for her to consume as much food as possible.   \n\n\nI later looked into this industry later on and realized she was right on the money (no pun intended) and there's millions of dollars floating around out there for girls who get chubby in realtime.\n\nI only spoke with her briefly and left. She got fired a couple hours later for doing coke in the bathroom and giving a BJ to one of our regulars who'd just gotten married the day before... which I found out the next day.  \n\nHope you're having your best fat girl summer, Sara, and you should probably stick to what you know.",

They apparently only had a 50 mile radius for a spell to be effective, while he, as the superior warlock, had a longer reach and could still cast spells on them.

            "text": "Wow do I have one of these in my life... So, in high school my best friend (who was a few years older than me) moved out of his parent’s home and got his own apartment. I of course helped with the move in and that is where I met Noelle (not her real name but it’s what she insisted everyone call her so let’s do it). Noelle was the pinnacle of a meth head, if they had meth head awards she would be hosting to steal all of the trophies to hock them for more meth. Noelle was one of his 2 roommates for close to two years. During the move in, the first time I had ever even heard of this person, she decided to tell me her entire life story, or at least what she could remember of it at any given point in time. Below is an incomplete and mostly in order list of every bit of information I was given/weird shit she did within 3 hours of us being made aware of each other: (tw:mentions of horrible shit and r*pe) (will definitely be long, but I’ve been told before that hearing this crazy shit is worth it)\n\n-she explained to me *how* her meth addiction started, yes right off the bat she was admitting to the meth.\n\n-the explanation that became drastically more terrifying as the 3 hours went on and more of the story came out? Her half brother had been r*ping her for years and when she finally got the courage to tell someone, he had told all of her friends a week prior that she was paying him to have sex with her, so not only did the entire town turn against her, she got kicked out of home because her parents believed him. \n\n-informed me that she could do any art commission I needed at a deeply discounted price. Her portfolio? 5 canvases of a generic naked alien lady and 3 pieces of dry wall that were badly cut from what I assumed was once a nursery wall depicting animal hybrids (one was a frog hawk...)\n\n-when I had turned to ask my friend to hand me a screwdriver so I could finish setting up their entertainment center by the time I looked back at her she had a banjo. The banjo was not in the room. I didn’t even see a guitar case in the apartment. She didn’t move from her spot. The banjo just appeared in her hands and she was strumming it and singing folk songs. I still have absolutely no fucking clue where the banjo came from. \n\n-I watched her head butt my best friend and their other roommate a dozen times each. And it was not a “love boop” like cats do or anything, she was full on swinging her head back and slamming it into their chests because... it was fun? I have no clue but my best friend basically had a permanent bruise across his chest for the entire time she lived with them. \n\n-at one point she collected her two cats, held one under each arm, stood on the back of the couch, and began *grooming* them with her own tongue. This was accompanied by the occasion “meow” from her that was so convincing I didn’t realize she was the one making the noises for a solid 5 minutes. \n\n-once we were done setting up the living room her boyfriend appeared. And I quite literally mean appeared, I never heard the front door open or saw anyone new come into the apartment. I was stocking the fridge and when I looked up meth jesus was just standing in the living room asking me what species of apple was in the bowl (Macintosh -_-)\n\n-speaking of meth jesus, he *also* introduced himself to me with the information that he was a meth head. Meth jesus and Noelle then launched into a tirade of explaining to me how to tell the difference between regular and psychedelic mushrooms that r naturally growing\n\n-after we had finished everything up we decided to watch a movie. My best friend, the third roommate, and myself all wanted to watch Hairspray at my recommendation because the third roommate had told me he had never seen it when we were setting everything up. At meth Jesus’s insistence we decided to watch Cars 2. Why? Because it was so funny that they had planes and buses... when I pointed out that I was pretty sure they had planes and buses in the first one, but never as a foreground character, I was yelled at for 6 minutes straight (I watched the clock) about how ignorant and annoying I was being... that is when I decided to just agree with whatever meth heads r saying so I don’t get an organ stolen. \n\n-about 20 minutes into Cars 2 meth jesus and Noelle bailed and went to her room, where they proceeded to have very loud and honestly painful sounding sex for the next 2 and a half hours\n\n-we immediately switched the move to hairspray and turned it up as loud as possible. \n\n-after the marathon or possible boxing match was done in noelle’s room she emerged completely naked and dripping in sweat. She and I immediately made direct eye contact, she said “oh ur still here”, then walked right into the kitchen to grab some mango juice and head back to her room. Another 20 minutes later and meth jesus *also* emerged butt ass naked and dripping sweat to which the exact same exchange happened. \n\nIt was at that moment that I realized I could only take so much meth head shenanigans and left. There was quite a bit more that happened but this is already humongous so I’ll leave it there.",

And they are both taking turns just going to TOWN doggy style on this kinda overweight chick. \n\n\nLike....what the fuck dude? Why on earth is that something okay to show ANYONE? Let alone two people you JUST met three days ago. \n\nHe went on to keep working at the location I was posted at for another 6 months before finally getting fired for getting caught snorting cocaine in the ladies bathroom.",

Anyways, I showed up to pick up my date and she dragged me inside and showed me her (completely trashed) house where everyone was smoking inside and there was a little baby that belonged to her younger sister. There was a giant furnace sitting in the middle of a pile of hoard, burning away while the baby played along side of it. An elderly woman sat in a rocking chair (their mom, but aged from the smoke). Her younger sister, who looked high school age, then came at me and showed me a blackened rectangle of cardboard (from the end of a notebook??) and shoved it in my face. She told me it was her “art”. It was burned around the edges in an amorphous kind of way, and the burns were not particularly clean or skilled. She told me she invented it when her sister (my date 🤢) threw her bag of chips into the furnace. She was so mad, she had thrown my date’s (🤢) poetry book into the furnace as well. My date had scrambled to pull it out and the whole book was destroyed, except the cover. The younger sister had continued to burn it ever since. I would consider this whole event to be the answer to op’s question. She could’ve just come outside and let me drive her to chili’s and I wouldn’t have learned how crazy her home life was...maybe ever as it would’ve been very unlikely there would be a second date under any circumstance.\n\nEdit: also my date’s bed was missing a leg, and I also later learned she was pregnant.

Anyways we had a good time reminiscing and ended up going to Andy’s house to hang out.\n\nI end up going outside for a cigarette and Beth comes and joins, we’re pretty lit at this point talking about random stuff. It takes an insane turn and she tells me about her baby 1-2 y/o(?) and how she’s so annoying. I don’t have any kids so can’t relate. She starts telling me how she gets so mad and slaps and hits the shit out of her. And how a few weeks ago she pushed or threw her at a wall. She then ended up telling me she feels like a bad mother and and regrets it and hoping for me to console her. I was kinda speechless and struggling to process it. I don’t think I really said anything other than variations of holy shit. I texting Andy to come outside and save me from this conversation and he came out and we helped her to bed.\n\nI left that night without fully explaining to Andy what Beth had said but said it was some fucked up shit. Beth called me the next day cus Andy told her I was really weirded out and left early. I didn’t see the call and she left a voicemail nervously and awkwardly explaining she doesn’t remember that night and that she’s sorry for whatever she said or did. It was very awkward. I actually never responded as I didn’t even see it until a few days later. Still not too sure how to handle the situation as that’s a pretty serious thing if it’s ongoing.\n\nThat was a long one but yeah that’s the most fucked up thing someone has said to me after just getting to know them.",

I was doing a long-term substituting position where I'd be in the same classroom for several months. This situation is most commonly done when a teacher is going on maternity leave, but in my situation the kid's teacher was having severe health problems that kept getting worse and worse so he couldn't come back and therefore the date of me leaving kept getting pushed back. Anyways, I'd a certified teacher but when you do a long-term substituting position in my district you don't have to be certified in the subject you're doing. You get lesson plans from another teacher who is certified in that subject. So, it's my first day. I've gotten my lesson plans from another teacher who teaches the same subject I'm substituting for in the same grade. We go over the planning calendar and basically come to the understanding that my students will be doing the exact same thing hers are doing on the same day. I'm basically going to be a clone. Absolutely no problem.\n\nOkay. Context provided. Now we'll get to the story. During my planning period I head to the teacher's lounge to make a copy of the stuff I'll need for the next day before I leave. The teacher's lounge is configured to where it's a medium size room and the copier is squished in the small hallway that leads to the staff restrooms. I try to get to the copier and she is basically blocking my way so I have no choice but to ask her if she's okay before saying \"Excuse me\" because she is just standing there practically catatonic and CRYING.\n\nShe says her husband has been arrested for... I shit you not.... MURDER. She proceeds to then tell me all about her husband's addiction issues and just uses me as her therapist. I'm 22 fresh out of college mind you this lady is in her late thirties. It was incredibly awkward and she basically put me in a position where it would be super awkward and probably rude if I just left. I had shit to do and rather than excusing herself to her classroom to take a moment, she basically positioned herself so that the next person to walk into the room would find her and see her sobbing uncontrollably.\n\nTo make matters worse, she'd call her husband from jail everyday from the teacher's lounge where we are all eating lunch (mid you, it's NOT a big room) and proceed to chat with him on the phone, at times loudly arguing with him about their relationship. They got a divorce, when you bet she illicit-ed as much pity and sympathy from me and other teachers as possible.\n\nThis was my FIRST day and she confides her husband got arrested for capital crimes.

So we put an invite out over the internet and had some people from the school that we didn't know come over for a meet-and-greet kind of thing. Along with the people we invited, this one kid (who already had a reputation for being *that* weird kid) tagged along with one of the guests. Not cool, but whatever. \n\nAnyways, to make a long story short, while the rest of us were sober, he was the only one to get drunk, and so he was constantly spilling his beans and oversharing all kinds of trauma and whatnot. The big one happened after we decided to do some kings cup. Someone pulled the \"never have I ever\" card and asked the group \"never have I ever had sex.\" Everyone drinks, except weird kid. I guess he felt pressured, so he drunkenly slurs \"does sex with toes count?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I had sex with someone's toes once.\"\n\n\"....like, they put their toes in you, or...?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah. But usually I would just suck on their toes.\"\n\n\"Oh\"\n\n\"It was my sister's toes\"\n\n\"Oh...\"\n\n\"My mom made us do it.\"\n\n\n\"...uh huh...\"\n\n\nHe then starts breaking down telling us about the sexual abuse his parents put he and his sister through, before getting up from the table, walking into our bathroom, and puking all over the place. He didn't even open the toilet seat. He just spewed it all over the seat, the floors, the walls. And it was mucousy too. It looked like he hurled his whole stomach lining all over our bathroom.\n\nWe got him a bucket, called a cab, and sent everyone home after that.\n\n**BONUS:** Another time, we were talking with someone over drinks when they start telling us about how they have sores all over their body because, when they were younger, their mom used to feed them her period blood to cure their illnesses. \n\n**BONUS BONUS:** Another time, I was sharing a cab home from the bar with a stranger when they started drunkenly spilling their guts about how his girlfriend had a miscarriage and he was so sad he wasn't a father.

Like all of the remaining staff were either from somewhere in Southern America or from the Balkan, like myself. This guy though, he was an American, but that wasn't the only strange thing about him. He never worked in a restaurant before, and he just walked in one day, asking for a job. The owner asked him if he had any prior experience, and he declined, and explained that he worked in the film industry, but that he just quit and that he's sick of that industry altogether. However, he added that he did spend around six months in Italy, so he clearly had that going for him, having that it was an Italian restaurant we were in. So, he got the job. He was completely clueless, but it did not phase him. He was sort of good looking, and obviously spoke much better English than anyone else in the restaurant (including the owner, who was actually Italian). So, here comes the answer to the original question. After maybe a couple of weeks, he comes in one morning and, as the mornings were slow, I was just polishing the glasses or something stupid like that, making the time pass, and he leaned on the bar and said, out of the blue, \"ooops, I made a mess this morning again.\"\n\nI asked him what do you mean, and he said, \"I shit the bed.\" I was like \"okay, retard, dumb joke, go away...\" but then he was like, \"what, as if you never do it\". I was like gtf out of my face dumbass, don't wanna listen to this shit, and he was like \"haaa, got ya, you totally believed that, I was only joking\". At that point I actually started to wonder if he actually did shit his bed, but I discarded it as he did not strike me as completely psychotic or even remotely unhygienic.\n\nAnyway, that's probably the weirdest thing I have ever heard from someone I've known for a very short time.",

He said he drove home and waited for her to call, and she did, the next day. They all got divorced, and his ex accused him of cutting the lines, but had no proof.\nAfter dude sobered up, he realized he barely knew me, and was terrified that I was going to tell someone what he'd done.

I didn't say anything but this suv was packed.  \n\n\nThings I saw inside  \nHula hoop   \nKitty litter  \nDried up towels   \nA lot of Candy  \nA lot of mints  \nRicky Martin CDs  \nMakeup  \nClothes  \nMultiple flip phones  \nNews papers  \nDisposable Floor mats on the car interior  \n1 foot tall box of condoms   \nStack of loose paper with phone numbers with times and dates (Which she left behind) everywhere in the whole car  \n\n\nI helped move this stuff over to her new car. She hid the condoms pretending like I never saw it. Long story short this whole ordeal took 6 hours. We had a older female worker who spoke to her and she basically said she was a Madam aka a Female pimp. When she left I had to take her trade into the garage. I looked at the random sheets of paper with phone numbers it was shocking the amount of sheets Inside. Crazy",

We had to go up and talk about a time we overcame adversity- most people were like “yeah a coworker didn’t like me but I turned it around” or “my mom was a single mom and I put myself through college” run of the mill stuff. Well, one of the ladies stands up and tells us how she moved here from Ethiopia on a lottery visa with her husband. They had absolutely no money so her, her husband, and their small child lived in a one bedroom apartment with another family from Ethiopia. She worked two jobs and her husband stayed at home with their son. Something to do with her visa allowed her to work, but because he was here as a spouse to hers, he couldn’t for a certain amount of time? I’m not entirely sure. Anyway. One day her son loses consciousness and is rushed to the hospital, her son unfortunately didn’t make it and passed away. She comes to find out that her husband had been horribly abusing their son, to the point that her son lost his life because it was so bad. She goes on to admit she blames herself because the situation they were in was because of her- she won the lottery visa that got her family here, she worked all the time which left her husband with their child which stressed him out, she saw the bruises on her child but felt she had no choice in alternative child care because they had no money, it also would’ve been rude to the family that they were staying with to cause a scene and accuse her husband of abuse/ill parenting when tensions were already high with 6+ individuals in a one bedroom apartment. It was... intense. She was crying, I was crying, most of the room was crying. We were completely stunned she shared this story with us, let alone went into detail over just how gruesome it all was and the incredibly abusive relationship SHE was in. None of us knew how to react and eventually an administrator came and like whisked her away, hopefully to get her help but none of us really knew her to like follow up- so I’m not sure what happened from there.",

That got eventually dropped to 4 free beers a day which in turn got dropped down to no free beers a day but we would get staff beer for a dollar. \n\nWell back when we were still getting our 4 free beers, I got to work the staff beer booth. It was a blast. It was basically like sitting at the keg at a party and pouring the beer for everyone. My cup stayed full the whole time, everyone had a blast, and as a sort of bartender, a few people hung out by the booth and would just drunkenly ramble on at me. \n\nSo one night, I'm working the booth, and a guy I sort of knew came up. He was more like a friend of a friend but he was a nice guy. It was a hippie festival so everyone was pretty laid back for the most part. So anyways, he got his first beer and just hung out up there the whole night. He had also been drinking whiskey all night so by his third beer, and these were 22 ounce cups, he was pretty hammered. \n\nSo we're talking. I'm drunk, he's drunk, there's music in the air, and out of nowhere, he just unloads on me about his genital warts. He's like drunk sobbing and going on and on about \"some bitch got me burned\" and \"my life's over\", stuff like that. I tried to console him as best I could but I didn't know what to say.

After the party he added me on Facebook and messaged me asking if I wanted to go drinking with him where he told me he met her and they really hit it off and he has really strong feelings for her. We meet a third time and BANG they are getting married. This was within the space of no more than 2-3 months. \n\nSo I congratulate him and he starts telling me how his family doesn't approve, especially his brother who he was going to ask to be his best man (where I immediately think, he isn't going to ask me to be his best man, is he?) but he doesn't want to because of the situation. He then starts talking about how we are such good friends and he trusts me and asks me to be his best man. This is literally the 3rd time we have met and tbh I wouldn't have considered him to be much more than an acquaintance at this stage.\n\nSo anyways I thank him and say I'm honored that he considered me but I can't commit because I might be away for work when the wedding was on, which was true. We continued meeting and I met his wife to be, they did seem like a great fit and I did end up considering him a good friend. I ended up moving to a different country after being head hunted for a job so had to decline his offer but I absolutely would have accepted it. \n\nSo yeah, definitely a dude who jumps head first into things. \n\nThis was 7 maybe 8 years ago but a look on his Facebook page they are still happily married so I'm really happy for him!

I think the colourful and unique interior, sequined signage and huge pot of free sweets on the counter reeled anyone and everyone in.\n\nOne day, whilst working with my manager, a mum and dad came in with their 3 young kids. I noticed as they entered that one of the kids was a little girl but was bald, clearly from chemo and my heart broke a little. My manager and I, who were stood behind the counter, greeted them all as they came in and looked around the shop, the kids oo-ing and aah-ing at all the colourful decorations but being very careful and polite rather than running amok. After they had all had a good look around the kids returned to the front desk with a huge pile of clothes. I asked whether it was somebody's birthday with there being such huge pile of clothes? 2 of the kids chirped up and said they were both about to have their birthdays in a week or 2. At the time of this occurance it was the summer holidays, and my birthday was coming up soon too, so I replied \"I'm a summer baby too!\", to which the bald little girl replied \"I'm the problem baby\".\n\nI let out an incredibly loud \"HA\" because I'm so used to my friends and myself saying stuff like that in a twisted dark humour kind of way (because if you don't laugh you'll cry amirite) that for a moment I forgot that this was a little girl, probably 8 year old tops, who was clearly just repeating something that she had overheard someone else say. The worst thing was that the family literally didn't react, they acted as if nothing had just happened, no \"oh sorry that's just her sense of humour\" or shock at her saying something so dark or anything of the sort, literally just acted as if her words and my laugh had never happened, which was even more unsettling. In an attempt to get past what had happened I shakily and hurriedly started packing all the clothes they'd bought into bags and asked the parents if it was okay with them for the kids to take a couple free sweets each from the tub, to which they happily agreed and then left with their new purchases.\n\nAfter they left I turned to my manager and apologised for laughing as I knew it was not an appropriate response and explained the same way I have explained above.

I should date a young military man, they're mature and strong\" before leaving for the day. \n\nI never spoke to this woman before that day, hell even knew she existed (she works opposite end of the building with online shopping). I was throughly weirded out by her and couldn't relate to her very well due to being happy with my relationship with my husband, no kids, and fine with where I am in life. She didn't even seem interested in conversation, just wanting someone to talk to, I suppose. Regardless, I try to avoid her whenever I see her.",

I was finishing my paperwork and charting for the night when a new CNA I had yet to meet walked in(I was one of a few trainers as our facility is the biggest in the county). \n\nShe was obviously not very shy and was blabbering about all kinds of personal information to me(One of the only 4 straight males in the entire facility), one of my trainees, and my hall partner. None of us asked her to. \n\nSo this girl is going on and on about her boyfriend and how often they have sex, her itchy crotch, and how her vagina stinks. I'm a fairly good humored person so I make the joke \"Make sure to always wipe front to back, not back to front 🙄\" in an exaggerated manner, and she immediately replied \"Yeah, yeah, I know. It's a bad habit and I really need to stop doing that.\" \n\nWe all just stare at her in disgust. Mind you a CNA's job in a nursing home is to help ambulate the residents, help them dress, and any other task they need assistance doing. MEANING that a big part of the job is assisting dependant residents and incontinent residents change their briefs(adult diapers.) Wiping the ass of a resident is a daily norm and if done incorrectly, particularly with females) you can give them awful UTIs and must worst.\n\nYou're taught how to do all of this correctly in CNA classes before getting scheduled out on the floor for hall training and if you don't know how to wipe your own ass correctly, you certainly don't need to be doing it for others.

I was essentially drowning in second-hand embarrassment.\n\nFinally, he finishes his call and proceeds to just stand there staring out the window for what felt like an eternity.

Pretty much my entire family decided to stay there, so we went down to the bar at the place to grab a drink and hang out. We get down there at like 8pm and there is a middle aged woman that is absolutely fucking blasted, who happened to be the only patron at the bar at the time. For whatever reason, she must have picked me out as the weak one of the group because she instantly started talking to me, and I could not for the life of me get her to stop. Shit started getting really crazy when she casually mentioned that her daughter had been raped recently, and that the police were doing nothing. She then explained to me that she knew exactly who it was that did it, so she planned to get her brothers together and they were driving over there to murder him, and were staying at the hotel for the night. She went into insane detail about what their plans were and when/where they planned on doing it. I was clearly incredibly perturbed but she couldn't tell because she was so drunk. Eventually my pops stepped in and took over the conversation when I called him over, and I ended up calling the police on them and giving them the details. I never heard anything back about what happened, but I do know that officers dropped by the hotel that night as I heard the sirens.",

He asked and I told him about my kiddo (toddler at the time). I asked him if he had any kids, which appeared to be the conversational opening he was looking for. He launched into a rant about how I should enjoy my son “while he’s too young to have an attitude”. He continued his tirade at speed about how his two adult kids wouldn’t talk to him anymore, despite him being a great dad. I couldn’t  get a word in edgewise. \n\nWithout prompting he offered up an example, that as a “veteran military man” he set simple rules and expected them to be obeyed. Like not giving his children their breakfast or anything to eat in the morning, if they weren’t fully dressed for the day and ready to go by 6am. He finally took a breath and in that moment I tried to come up with a polite response, and said that it must be hard on his wife for them to be estranged from the kids. He quickly responded that he wasn’t married, and that he was there with his girlfriend.

He said it was rough but during the two years after the death of his son they had two more children. He said that around the two year mark something changed and suddenly his wife became convinced he had killed their son. So she perused charges and he went to court. He swore the only evidence they had was a broken rib. Which he says must have happened while he was on the phone with 911 and giving him CPR. Anyway he was convinced of negligent homicide. \n\nSo she’s like i want to believe him but I reminded her that something felt way off.

He grabbed a whip he made out of his closet and starting flinging it around, almost hitting me multiple times, and thought it was funny that I flinched. He said he wouldn't ever hurt me, and then proceeded to tell me that his life dream was to move to South Carolina where he can buy a small ranch of his own, and to then own a slave and join the KKK. I was in complete shock, he even said the n word with the hard r multiple times. Later in the day he also told me about how he wanted to shoot up the school when he was in middle school, but got in trouble for it before he could do it. I left as soon as I could because clearly this guy was beyond fucked up in the head and not someone I wanted to associate with. About a week later he texted me some poem about how in love with me he was. Super creepy. A few years later he got sent to jail for threatening to kill some guy over something petty.

Every day the class would break for 15 minutes at the half way point, and me and a friend would use the break to go out for a quick cigarette. \n\nOne day after said cigarette, we come back and the professor asks the 15 person class to write a quick short short story about anything that comes to mind.\n\nSome stories were funny, others were thoughtful, some anicdotes. Nothing super surprising, except for the girl sitting directly beside me. She decided to use this opportunity to confess (for the first time to anyone she added later) about the time that her uncle molested her while she was little... \n\nThis was awkward enough on its own. What really took it to the next level was the fact that the short story opened up with the line, \"I remember the smell of cigarettes on his breath...\" \n\nYea... That was fucking fun.",

He was an infant and was, in fact, very cute. My daughter was probably 3 or 4 and waiting nicely with us. I thank the woman and turn to my kids to continue their mild entertainment. I think the interaction is over but I was so very wrong. Suddenly she sits at our table and lays in about how HER son was a sweet little boy once but the devil got in his heart. That’s how he got in trouble with the law. She goes on and on, talking about how she needs to bail him out of jail but the banks won’t give her loans and is just waiting for her guardian angel to help them out. Talking about all of their ailments but she knows one kind soul could just change her life. \n\nI’ve never screamed with my eyes before that day, alas my husband was deaf to my visual cry for help and just happily waved from across the room. Of course you’d think that would be the last of it? You thought wrong. Maybe a month later she comes to our table and tries to pick up my son. One of us just grabbed him before she could reach him. She goes on about how her sons in prison and my husband is just as passive as I am but we stopped our meal there and left. We don’t eat inside anymore, and post pandemic probably never will. \n\nMental problems, inability to gather social cues, loneliness, I’m not sure what on the long list of possibilities she’s got goin on but I won’t enter a portillos again because of it.

Fortunately, the bastard died in 2009 and his site and most of its offshoots went defunct even before that. IDK if Russian law enforcement got to any of his colleagues, but I want to believe they did. He also had some American associates apparently and hopefully they got what was coming to them as well. Anyway.\n\nSome things came to light even before he died, i.e. that he preyed on girls from poor and destitute families, ran some kind of a commune where they would be naked 24x7 and engaged in some pseudo-spiritual bullshit... but it all seemed to stop \"just short\" of actual full-on sexual abuse. Laws back then were lax enough that he could photograph and film these girls doing non-sexual things naked, like hiking, dancing, boating, etc. and sell and publish this material above board without being arrested and prosecuted for it, even though most of them were minors.\n\nSo this girl I met, she drunkenly told me and a few others that (to nobody's surprise) things went farther than that. The girls were encouraged to \"experiment\" with their own bodies and each other, and of course it was all filmed and photographed and distributed through more covert channels. There were a few boys involved too, though adults apparently only encouraged the abuse but didn't participate, not that it made things any better. The most fucked-up thing was how chill and OK she seemed to be with it. Drunk or not, you don't expect anyone to talk about things like this in the same manner they'd tell you how they went to buy groceries yesterday. Several people asked her if she ever went to the law enforcement in Russia or in the States, and she said that the thought never crossed her mind and she didn't know why she would. It was fucking surreal.\n\nI never saw her after that, but yeah, I think this qualifies as the most fucked-up thing a stranger ever told me. And of course, I have no idea whether she was lying in part or just made up the whole damn thing, but there you have it.",

The business provided mental & behavioral health services for children, including a residential facility where particularly high-needs kids resided (most of them came from high trauma situations where they experienced abuse, drug addiction, and severe mental health). \nGiven the sensitive nature of our clients' needs, and the difficult job of working with such a sensitive population, we had very high burnout & turnover, so we were constantly recruiting.\nI came across an applicant that had prior experience in a residential facility a few towns over and called to screen the applicant. She seemed reasonable and qualified, even open to the hour-long commute, so I invited her for an in-person interview with me and a House Manager.\n\nThe interview was a shitshow from the start. She was late, and dressed inappropriately (a lowcut top & short skirt more fitting for clubbing than working with kids in a professional environment).\n\nWe greet her and start with a preliminary softball question: \"So tell us a little about yourself & why you want to work with this population [children with severe mental & behavioral health]?\"\n\nWithout taking a breath, she launches into: \"Well I've experienced everything these kids have and worse; I was a failed abortion who was raped and abused, and ran away to live with my boyfriend who tried to pimp me out, but then I started taking supplements and began my online ministry and cured myself, so I have a lot to teach these kids about getting over their problems and coming to Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior\" (one big run-on sentence without pause)\n\nThe manager and I just sat back in our chairs with our mouths open as she started to go into further details without any prompting. Dumbstruck, I let her ramble on for another minute before I cut her off and said \"Wow, you know that's truly awful what you went through, and I'm sorry you had to go through that. That being said, Im concerned about your openness in sharing such highly personal & sensitive details of your life with 2 strangers\"\nShe cuts me off, explaining \"Well I believe that sharing my experiences with the children will teach them that they don't have it so bad and if I can get over it, so can they\"\nI clarified: \"So you believe it's appropriate to discuss your personal traumas in detail with our clients?\"\nHer: \"Yes absolutely! That's how I can tell them how I was saved by Jesus and that His love is the only therapy we need!\"\n\nShe seemed so proud of her answer.\n\nMe: \"I thought so. Well, thank you for your time but we will not be progressing any further in the interview. Thank you for coming in\".\n\nShe looked confused but still gleefully proud.\nI stood up with her, leading her out the door and down the hall as this wrap-up occured and told her \"Ill walk you out\".\nOnce she was safely to the exit she asked \"so when do I start??\"\n\nI looked her dead in the face and said \"Never. I don't mean to be harsh ma'am, but you are clearly not appropriate to work in this kind of care setting with trained mental health professionals. I hope the cyber ministry works out for you because you will never have a career in this field. Please leave now\".\n\nI've had a lot of crazy interviews, but that one was the weirdest and the shortest.",

Guess he got real comfortable talking to me cuz he started asking further questions, like if it was okay that nudes were in the film, and if we do anything about explicit imagery. I was mildly amused because we see fine art nudes(and not so artful ones) all the time come through but I assured him that the images are between whoever develops them and him alone. \n\nWell, that seemed like enough for him to continue on to a story about what exactly was on his film, and the things the photos led to... apparently his mother got a divorce recently,  and requested of him to take photos of her nude to boost her self esteem and make her feel wanted. Apparently that really did it for the both of them, and after all the awkward set up he reveals he ended up having sex with his mother.\n\nAt this point I really should have just hung up because I was getting a bit uncomfortable, customers needed assistance, and I had already been chatting a fairly lengthy bit of time with this man. Alas, I'm much too awkward, and I really took pride in my customer service skills, so he continued... and described the next morning, where he bed his mother again, and then did it in the tub. I had enough and squeaked out between his ramblings something along the lines of\n\n \"Ok well, I have other customers waiting but if you're looking to get film developed there's really no issue with what's on the roll. Thanks for calling, bye\"\n\nFor a few weeks I was afraid to see the man come in, especially because customers ask for the associate they were talking to all the time. He never showed up... I assume he just needed to tell someone about his perverted little sexcapade and I was the unfortunate sap to sit through it all.",

It was…not my favorite night train ride.",

Asked if i be interested in bicycling n that he had 3 bikes 1 of which i could use. One day after a ride a teenage girl who lives in my neighborhood was at the convenience store which is across from this guys house and strolled over towards us. For context im 37 and said girl has thrown herself at me in front of my young children and i know her parents especially her mother whom ive been intimate with in high school as well as an affair when said teenage girl was 4 yrs old. Her comment to me and this guy was a smart ass sexual innuendo more or less pointed at me although the guy had no clue. I smiled then waved but know better than to reply verbally. Once gone he made a comment that we should have invited her in for a drink. Taken a back while immediately wanting to fish a little n see if hes just a typical guy just making a cringe worthy off comment on a good looking young woman (i mean she is 16 for context but looks 25 in more ways than one n he had no idea how young she actually was) or a flat out pedo i reply nah she’s too old for me. He laughs kinda looks me over as if feeling the situation out then says yeah younger would be better but itd be better if she wasn’t a she. I tell him i “experimented” in college but young girls have always been my thing. At this point inside im kinda panicked and feel like im on “What Would You Do” but no one is showing up or coming in with the whoa there buddy moment……. Apparently this guy was real comfortable with me bc he asks if i want something stiff to drink and gets us drinks which by the way may have been the best scotch ive ever had. He then tells me he has to be careful bc he has a “history” but luckily no convictions even though hes been on the radar several times. I ask him how young he prefers his young boys to which he smiles and says the younger the better the little ones don’t even think anything of whats happening they love it like its a game. Welp as a father of a 4 and 6 yr old at the time i had heard enough and lets just say things got very painful and awkward for one of us. Very very painful and awkward. One of us was then warned that if any child in the area so much as filed a report or a whisper of a weird acting fellow was to emerge the other would assume the other as the guilty party and the experience which had just occurred would seem like a picnic compared to what would come. A week later one of the parties involved posted fliers throughout not only his neighborhood but the other 3 in close vicinity of the occurrence with an address and description of a predator of young children………….. 6 weeks later there was a house for sale",

I was waiting outside the classroom because the door was locked (the college I went to had a lot of tech in each of the rooms, so this was a common thing).

This was literally the second time I had ever seen him in my life because it was only the second day for this class. The first time we met it only consisted of that nod people give acknowledging the other person's existence because you happened to make eye contact with them.\n\nWell... This guy starts talking and because I wanted to be polite, I pause my video and participate in the small talk. Without warning, this guy starts complaining about how his boyfriend was awful in bed, how he wasn't as clean as he promise and now he (my classmate) had genital warts and a rash that was very itchy and very painful that wouldn't go away.\n\nI uncomfortably told him that sounded sucky and tried to go back to my video but no luck because at that point in my life I had no idea how to go about telling someone to stop, politely or otherwise. He then spent the next 15 minutes going into excruciating detail about his BDSM, puppy play sex life with heavy details about restraints, toys, and collars. \n\nI honestly don't care about sexual orientation or what people do in the bedroom but to go into lewd detail about what you like to do behind closed doors with a complete stranger? Yeah, too much, buddy.

Then he just started telling me an insanely intense battle story that resulted in many deaths on both sides and him barely surviving after receiving multiple bullet wounds.\n\nYou could tell it was a hard story to tell, but when he finished he literally let out a sigh of relief and said “I’ve never told anyone that story, you know it really feels good to let it out.  You know you are really easy to talk to.”\n\nI do think I’m generally pretty easy to talk to....but not anything special.

So he used to behead people he suspected of being involved with the North Vietnamese, and leave their heads in the center of the village, dumping their bodies in the jungle. He had a good laugh at the end of his story, and started telling me he would pay for my trip to Canada if the US got into another war like Vietnam. He thought I was a good kid, and wanted to spare me the horrors of war and all that.\n\nHe then began talking about the old Windows 95 kaleidoscope screensaver, and how it reminded him of how he used to trip balls on acid back in the 70s. Adding that his wife was always riding him about staring at the screensaver for hours on end. A reasonable gripe I guess.\n\nHe capped it all off with a rant about how drug dealers were ruining the community. He claimed he would hang out by the river, kill them, and hide their bodies in the desert. \n\nI don’t know if the dude was filling my head up with shit or not, he was out there.

            "text": "Acid Man on Public Transit \n\nMinneapolis, MN\nIt was the night of July 4th, 2013. \n\nThen 18 year old, petite, high-fem female.\nImportant details for later:\nI made a good female friend that night who said that I looked like I could've been 15 if it wasn't for my curves. I had fair skin, bleached blonde mid-length curly hair, light grey eyes, & a very sweet & innocent look.\n\nI had just moved to the city from the Rez for college. A friend back home encouraged me to go enjoy the fireworks & see if I make any new friends (despite struggling with agoraphobia, social fear, & panic). Very much not fun was had. \n\nIt was a lame fireworks performance with big crowds, constant cigarettes, & groups of drunk or rude people all surrounded by cars & exhaust. The cover band sucked. Leaving was a certain hell already because the exits were dead packed with almost no movement. It took maybe 5 minutes to get up maybe 7 stairs. (Trying not to exaggerate but I really think that's correct.) \n\nEnded up getting terribly lost once getting away from the bridge & even though I had a phone, I didn't have a service provider. I was relying on public wifi (which was not as available as it is now). Maybe 10 or 15 minutes after either midnight or 1AM, I finally find the right bus. \n\nMy first time sitting in the back of the bus. I'm alone in front of a relaxed & joking white guy with wild, frizzy, curly, dark hair. I remember that he was sitting alone & had a backpack but that's all I remember. He was making friendly, humorous talk with me as I was sitting down. I mentioned being lost but didn't get specific, guess that's all he needed. He offered me acid right away & that weirded me out so I immediately & clearly said \"no\" a few times & ignored him. \n\nI was finally able to call my friend (using the transit wifi) & tell her that I was on the bus. Once I hang up I hear & feel that man lean into my hair & right ear (I was already leaning on the window). He very clearly but softly said : \"you look just like a girl that I gang raped with a few bikers.\" \n\nI was horrified & was already panicking before he finished that first sentence. He continued detailing his experience but I missed everything valuable for the police to investigate. Might've heard him say it was a year earlier & was maybe in a different state? \n\nWith what must've been a face of pale terror, I locked eyes with a very petite Chinese girl directly across the isle from me. (I didn't realize) she was paying attention to my situation. She VERY quickly rang the exit bell & pushed past the man to tightly grab my arm & force me to stand & run off with her. I was already crying before we got past the bus rear exit doors. \n\nSweet girl but I remember that she kind of aggressively asked if I was OK & safe. She mentioned that she thought the man & I were friends because we were laughing when she first got on the bus but she knew something was wrong when I loudly said \"no\" to him. On a later date, she told me that my face made her react without really thinking. She is so strong & smart. (Love you, Yang! I hope your life is beautiful in all the ways.) \n\nSo I slept on her couch that night & she took me to valley fair with her friends the next day (to \"make sure I didn't get traumatized\"?). \n\nI ended up making a great friend that horrible night.\n\n(Sorry for any mistakes or poor grammar)\n\nTLDR: July 4th, very late. Got on the bus & a guy told me that he gang raped a girl that looked like me",

My job doesn't usually involve taking calls from the general public, but they do come up occasionally--especially if the person working the main switchboard is new, or just confused about how to handle the call.\n\nOne day I'm about 2 seconds from going to lunch and I get one of these calls. Arg. 99% of the time I just redirect them to the correct department, so it's OK to let it go to voice mail. But I figure it's better to deal with it now than put it off.\n\nThe caller tells me that he needs to get a message to someone (someone who receives services from the agency I work for), but he needs my help. He doesn't actually know the guy's name, he only knows him by the nickname T-bone.\n\nThis isn't actually very unusual. I ask him to tell me as much information as he can so I can pass on the message. He tells me that he's friends with T-bone's baby momma and T-bone needs to know that the baby momma was murdered.\n\nI say, \"Oh no, I'm so sorry.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he says, \"She just answered her front door and they attacked her.\"\n\nSo horrible.\n\n\"They injected her injected her in her neck.\"\n\nA less common method of assault, but plausible.\n\n\"It was a CIA agent.\"\n\nUm... \n\n\"He is a doctor. Not a real doctor, but they call him a doctor. He was sent by the FBI.\"\n\nI mean, the CIA can be real sketchy.\n\n\"He had actually gone to the baby momma's house looking for me, but he killed her instead.\"\n\nAt this point I'm wondering if this is just a very garbled version of this guy telling me there's a warrant for his arrest. Maybe some of the details have gotten mixed up.\n\nThen he continued.\n\nThis doctor is working out of a garage on the nearest military base. He uses the garage to store equipment to control a satellite. The satellite gives him the ability to control the caller's body and make him do things he doesn't want to do. He has to get the message to T-bone quickly before the satellite turns back on and starts controlling him again. \n\nA-ha. This is the moment where it all comes together for me. I know now what I'm dealing with. \n\nI took a message and passed the message on to someone who could hopefully get him the help he needed.

(This was the late 90s) He told us how he was deployed in Desert Storm and advancing through Kuwait, they found a farmhouse where the civilians asked for help.  Their 13 year old daughter had been violently raped and was covered in blood.  The medic described the sexual nature of her injuries and I prefer to not get into those details—yes it’s as bad as you’re thinking.\n\nThen as they continued to advance only a few miles they found several Iraqi soldiers who promptly surrendered because they had no vehicle to escape in.  They had blood all over their fatigues and hands...the blood was not theirs as they were completely unharmed....and they were unarmed.\n\nBeing certain they were the perpetrators of the act, he shot all three of them where they stood.  And put AKs on their bodies to tell their superiors they were armed.\n\nAfter the guy walked off we stared at each-other.\n\n“Did we just have a war crime confessed to us?”\n\n“Yes.  Yes we did.”",

We talked a lot about video games and tv shows, we were bored and awkward people. Keep in mind he was probably about 5 or 6 years older than her. So he told me that he began molesting and sexually abusing his sister when she was about 2 or 3. As he explained it, it started as play during her baths and progressed to sexual abuse. Their parents often left him to watch her for hours at a time from when he was about 8 on. It got so bad that he would chase her around the house when she was about 8 and he would abuse her while their parents were home. She eventually told them. Those literal pieces of shit just told him to leave her alone and continued to leave them alone in the house together when they went out. Again, as he explained it, he continued to abuse her and around the time she hit puberty he began raping her and she'd beg her parents for help only to be ignored. By 13 she was abusing hard drugs and by 15 she had run away and would prostitute herself and steal from her childhood home to finance her drug habit. He said he felt really bad for ruining her life but it was time for her to own her mistakes. I was so shocked I could barely breathe. My blood still runs cold when I think about it. As far as I'm concerned that piece of shit is a fucking real live psychopath, torture and death would be too good for him AND his piece of shit parents. I never spoke to him again after that and to this day I carry that shit with me. How tf would a sane human not?",

The hotel was made up of about 40 rooms and each of them included cheap coffee, a rust stained coffee pot, a squeaky bed, and a complimentary cockroach. Normally, I worked 3 days a week (Thursday-Saturday) and almost always on the 3pm-11pm shift. Occasionally I worked more, sometimes less, and every now and then I worked the 11pm-7am shift, too. \n I do not exaggerate when I say that in those 8 years of working at the hotel I became a kind of priest, listening to the endless confessions of crackheads, prostitutes, drug dealers, adulterers, and whatever manifestation of the human shadow that came my way. The front desk office was the confessional and the stale pastries and burnt coffee our sacraments.\n There were more instances than I can count where, no joke, some fumbling bumbling John Doe would come stumbling in, flop down on the flattened couch, and after a long sigh and a fevered fit of itching, would tell me the strangest, darkest, saddest, weirdest and often times most unbelievable stories/details about their life. One homeless fella in his 50’s (who told me he was willfully homeless and had been so his whole adult life and enjoyed it) strongly encouraged me to “try everything once”. I pressed him on this issue and said “everything? Like....*everything*?” He nodded and explained that he had done it all - from drugs to crimes to things I’d rather not have heard. I specifically asked him if he meant that I should truly try everything, like, even murder... to which he casually shrugged and said, “yup.”\n  But, of all the nights spent at that hotel, the strangest thing I remember being told was one evening when a man came in the front lobby, wearing a red winter jacket and no pants (he had on checkered boxers, I remember that) and told me that he had a fetish with faces and would I be willing to go to his room with him and let him “remove my face”. As you can imagine, I was reluctant. He pushed the question again and when I asked him why he wanted my face he calmly explained that it was because he liked my face and very much wanted to “add it to his collection.”\n    I refused his request and told him that it’d be best if he returned to his room. He nodded and then leaned over the counter, close enough to my face for me to shift in my seat, and said “you might not be cool with it but JESUS is. Jesus is cool with it.” And then he turned and walked out and I never saw him again.",

            "text": "OK, American English teacher in East Asian country. About a year ago an older gentleman joined one of my classes. Retired, wealthy and bored. He comes to a few classes and we have very innocuous conversations. One day, no one else shows up to the class and he asks can we just do a \"free talk\" session. Since no one else was there I said sure. We talk mostly about his business life and his philosophy on the subject. I asked him why he retired and its a story I will never forget.\n\nSo he was completely focused on his business and barely saw his wife and two kids who were being raised in the US while he was in the China. His son when he was a teenager started getting into trouble. So he decided to bring him back to Shanghai where he was located. Bought him an apartment and enough money to survive and basically left him to his own devices. Obviously, a 16 year old with a bunch of money and his own apartment, you can guess the trouble he got into. A few months into this arrangement and his son ends up knocking up an escort. He tells his father who is none too pleased about this. The girl starts asking for a money. Well the father has connections to organized crime in China and has them pay her a visit. Telling her that we will give a you an ungodly amount of money to abort the pregnancy. Kind of a \"You don't have a choice\" situation if you know what I mean. So the girl has the abortion and the son is sent back to the US.\n\nSon apparently becomes depressed and gets very into drugs. At one point he takes a hulking amount of pills in a suicide attempt. The father rushes back to the US to see his son in the hospital. He was in a coma for a few weeks. When the son came to and they were talk the father asked why he had done this. The son looked him straight in the eye and said \"You killed my son so I wanted to kill yours.\"\n\nI was stunned. Just absolutely floored that he was telling me any of this. I really didn't even know what to say. He told me that this was when he decided he needed to retire.\n\nI went home after the class and immediately poured myself several glasses of Scotch to calm my nerves. I wasn't ready for that story in an English class. I can only guess that he never told this story to anyone else and it was a bit of a catharsis for him. Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read my story.",

In a creative writing class I was taking, a student announced that he sang and had a group or something. I think later in the period our class and a few other classes went out to a courtyard to listen to him and his friend play. They were very good. When we came back to our classroom a girl I had become acquainted with stated to the class that she had her own music, too. We kind of thought she was trying to one-up the guy but were still interested. Now here's the thing, she was in another class of mine where we sat next to each other and she mentioned that she wrote her own music and showed me some songs. She would also occasionally tell me that she loved the Disney Channel (she was a Junior at the time so I found it odd that she still watched it but didn't think too much of it). I remembered telling her they were great. In the CW class that day, she happened to have a CD of her most recent song and asked our teacher to play it. A friend of mine in the class whispered (but loudly enough for others near her to hear) that the song wasn't this girl's. It was an instrumental of a song by a group called R5 (I think the singer in that band was on Austin and Ally on Disney Channel). I'm pretty sure the girl heard her but she was just smiling proudly and looking at our teacher. Some people giggled. It finally clicked in my head that she was probably a fan of the group and tried to pass on their music as hers. It was cringy as hell but my friend and some of the others just dropped it.",

            "text": "My sibling is a chronic over-sharer and has lost multiple jobs (yet somehow is able to stay married) because of it.  His newest “persona” is Dad Joke Guy (at barely 30yo) and will apparently harass co-workers all day with his lame “dad” jokes.  Yes, he’s gotten demoted and fired for this.  Yes, he still does it.  And yes, he *tells* us he does this. \n\nOther hits include:\n\nHis massive gun collection. \n\nHow he had to get testosterone shots to knock up his wife. \n\nHis parenting style (which can really only be described here as: How to train your dog- I mean baby- I mean raise.  i.e. say lots of cringey things like “Who’s a good boy?!? And good boy son!  Sit.  Sit!  SIT. I SAID SIT!  And, it’s time to go potty! Show daddy who can go potty!  This kid is only 3 and way smarter than my brother.)\n\nHow his great master (fool-proof) plan is to buy 100 acres in Midwest state (where he’s never been), open up a gun range/custom gun shop (of which he has no professional experience but what LE wouldn’t want to hire a hobbiest armorer?!?), while his wife “rescues” animals (ie adopts), and they all live the high life with no money or health insurance because neither of them has any real work ethic (wife) or brains (brother) to pull off making such a big undertaking financially successful (did I mention they are massively financially illiterate?  But god forbid I tell SIL she’s wrong about something financial- and I’m a accountant. Brother is a whole other story when you try and have any sort of convo about this “plan”). \n\nHow one time in grade school X happened to him because of Y and that then Z happened and now he can’t do A anymore but that’s ok because he doesn’t like doing B but sometimes he likes A and that last week his son said XYZ and that means C but only when son is doing CDE and his wife doesn’t really like that but he does so now they just sometimes do FGH and that’s why he is going to go to city K.  (And don’t you DARE interrupt for ANY reason while he’s telling you all this or he’ll rip your head of and either pout or get really red in the face and just stop talking period).  Yes. He does this at work.  Yes, he’s been demoted and fire for this.  Yes. He still does it. And yes, he tells us stories about how he has these convos at work. \n\nHe also gets really weird ideas in his head about things, and once he does, no amount of logic or reason or proof will sway him in any way to change his mind.  He is a chronic “mansplainer” and really only can have “conversations” where he’s lecturing you- usually about a subject that he really has no real knowledge about.  Thankfully these are usually harmless (like his parenting choices, or how to buy a home- something I’ve done twice but he has never done, how divorce *really* works, what X law *really* means, how higher education- bachelors/masters/PhD- are scams and they’d never pay to send their child to get a “worthless” education.  Me, my dad, and mom all have at least a BA- they are a whole other story. Or how they set the price of tea in China, or what X movie *really* is about even though his “interpretation” doesn’t make any sense) and not conspiracy shit - thankfully his wife does have some intelligence.  But sometimes I fear that their combined ignorance is going to reduce my VERY smart nephews IQ a few points (also because they don’t believe in higher education.  That they didn’t go to university so trade school is good enough. This is why my mom, grandpa, and I are all already saving for his future education, because nothing will sway them that one size does not fit all). \n\nMy family is exhausting.",

He feels this is the right time to tell me he likes to eat doo doo. I say, \"Not my thing. But, to each his own, I guess.\" I attempt to steer the conversation to less gross places. Completely ignoring me, he then informs me that he also enjoys eating his dog's doo doo. Again, I say, \"I'm not into that at all.\" Still doesn't get the hint. Just continues and goes on this diatribe about how great it feels to cover himself in shit and lay in a shitty bed and roll around in it. With me intermittently repeating myself, \"Very much not into that.\" Nope, not my thing at all.\" \"That's a bit much for me.\" What other sorts of things do you like to get into?\" \"Do you have any toys?\" \"Do you like vibrating toys?\" He just kept right on going. Nothing I said mattered. So, I finally blocked him. Lo and behold, a couple months later, he sends me a message. He's changed his username. Albeit, not very creatively. I ask him what exactly happened last time we spoke. He asks, \"What do you mean?\" I reminded him of what happened and he seemed completely unaware that I had even blocked him or what for. So, I explained it. He then went directly into the same obsessive diatribe from the previously conversation. I block him again. From time to time he still sends me messages. He's gotten better at making creative usernames. But, he still doesn't change up his pics. So, everytime he sends me a message, it only takes me a couple of minutes to figure out it's him and he gets blocked. I've thought about reporting him for harassment. But, A) He's not harming me in any way. He's just irritating and obsessive. B) Unless he gets aggressive with me and starts threatening me, I doubt there's anything the admins will do anyway.

We were a nexus point for people without much to do or no place to stay, and also when you meet hundreds of people per shift, you are 100% going to encounter people just not in the right state of mind that day.\n\nWe were supposed to be open, friendly, and appear inviting/welcoming. And for years, people would just spill their guts at a 'hello'. Probably meant that they really, really needed to get something off their chest but still, it can be really uncomfortable. \n\nSo many stories. Their whole family died a couple days ago in a wreck/accident/fire. A family member or child just committed suicide and they didn't know what to do or were going to kill themselves too. People who broke down crying because they don't know how they're going to pay their bills. Or crying because they had bills with us and couldn't take the items they chose home that day. (Since I was full time and had been doing it for years, I could usually lower the price or just wipe the slate clean if certain criteria were met.)\n\nAlso people who broke down because they just found out they were dying. Or a loved one/friend was dying. Illnesses and the bills they would cause were one of the most frequent we encountered. Blind rage was also frequent. Screaming at the top of their lungs, losing their shit and throwing the chair they were just sitting on, etc. Thank god I left before COVID and the mask mandates.\n\nAnd it's never not uncomfortable when someone casually drops the fact that they were raped the other day. Or on a regular basis. Mostly women, prolly 10-20% were men. Or regular beatings. Witnessing a beating or death.\n\nInsane amounts of drugs. Powders, pipes, needles, little things of tinfoil, lighters, elastic bands, straws, long and narrow strips of paper, cotton balls - sometimes with black splotches, sometimes red. Just everywhere, get spilled because they weren't careful lifting everything they checked-out or were out in plain sight as they opened their purse or old packs reused.\n\nWe were basically library staff and now randomly made into a social worker. And it went on for years and years. Turnover got really high, especially in part time. Some women refused to work the desk anymore which either ended up with them quitting or me and the one other male staff member spending most of the day out front while our own work piled up.\n\nWe were eventually allowed to tell people who would brag to us about their sexual exploits or conquests that we would refuse service if they didn't stop. This sometimes led to rage. A lot of BDSM people loved having a captive audience before we got to that point. People also loved to tell you how big something was that they could fit inside their rectum. Men and women. Personal achivements were usuall women, could fit someone's appendage or something of a certain size in select orifaces. Mostly men liked to brag about a certain feature of a relationship. The hottest, the biggest of certain body parts, BBW, race fetish, etc.\n\nThe kid's would often drop bombshells without realizing they did so. Then we'd have people from Youth Services come up and comfort them while we called the police. One coworker quit on the spot as soon as a family member came to pick up the kid. She tossed her lanyard on our boss's desk and said she couldn't deal with that and left. Couldn't blame her though it left me alone to close.\n\nYou'd get real bad burnout. You'd just kind of stop feeling anything. You still stick a smile on your face to do your job but goddamn. There were times where weeks were kind of a blur. For me, I'd go to work, and remember the first little bit and then kind of snap back to being aware of being 'in the moment' at closing time, exhausted and sad.\n\nI know sometimes a victim of something horrible just can't help it and they just spill everything that's happened to them. But sometimes I would really resent being told all these awful things. Because it was the 4th time that week and I was feeling exhausted and numb again.\n\nAbout a year or so before I left, our desk drawers were stocked with color coded cards about the size of a business card that we could give someone if they started talking about a difficulty they were having. Homelessness waw blue, abuse was green, illness was pink, sexual assault/crimes/rape/abuse was yellow, not being able to afford anything to eat was red, and I don't remember what orange and purple were. We could give them that card that would have phone numbers appropriate for the situation. A free health screening, a low cost or free counciling session, survivor hotlines that could put someone in touch with what they needed most, CODA, etc. Apparently we were far from the only place juet overwhelmed with people just unloading themselves because those cards went to us and all our branches, fire stations, the Annex, the Courthouse, the BMV, etc.",

He mostly smelled like BO, but occasionally smelled like Chlorine. He also NEVER spoke a word at all, either shaking his head yes/no or giving you the thumbs up/down. \n\nWe had a Science class together my Sophomore year. Our teacher randomly paired us up for a huge end of the year project. I asked him if this was gonna be a situation where I did all the work, or if he'd actually contribute, assuming he'd talk back through either a thumb up/down. Instead, he went \"I don't think it's fair to give you everything. I'll do whatever half you don't want\".\n\nSuprised, we worked in silence together for a few minutes. He then started to pour out his life story:\n\"Ya know, I've been having a feud with my parents for a few years now. After I tried killing myself in middle school, I got really into heavy metal and started taking guitar lessons to help my mental health. I thought I could become a Rockstar by the 8th grade, so I figured I'd look the part and grow out my hair. My mom and Dad told me that they wouldn't tolerate me having long hair, since it's feminine, so they threatened to take away my stuff. At first, I thought they were bluffing, but then I came home and found they dismantled my bed for firewood. Then, my mom stopped buying me deodorant and toothpaste. After that, my Dad put a lock on the washing machine so I couldn't use it until I cut my hair. Now, they won't even let me eat, so I have to rummage through the school's garbage if I'm hungry. But, it's whatever, I wash my clothes and take showers in our pool, the floor is good for my back anyway, and I learned quickly how to steal their toothpaste. Plus, now I'm better than ever at guitar, so people occasionally give me money on the street. I'm saving up to finally move out and start a metal band called \"Crazy Cuts\". \n\nI just kinda sat there in disbelief, and slowly went back to work on our science project. The following year, I found out his Grandfather died and left all of his wealth to the guy, so he ditched town. I haven't heard from him since, and he has no social media for me to catch up, so I have no clue how he's doing now.",

Sleeping next to the pig, caring for it, hand feeding, etc. He loved this pig and wanted it to get better. \n\nMe and the bartender are full into this story, we are shooting some local eye-blinding moonshine at this point and getting into it. \n\nThis old hippy is just staring off into the distance and starts tearing up. Says... As it got better, it you know got more and more aggressive. It was a breeding pig and was use to rutting all the time and just kept getting worse and worse. So, he tried jacking it off to see if he could release some tension and that just didn't work.\n\nMe and the poor bartender are just staring horrified and this dude with his thousand yard stare at the wall starts full on balling and says through sobs. \"I loved that pig, so I just let him fuck me\". \n\nThere are no words for the emotion or facial expression that me and that bartender had. This dude just starts sobbing uncontrollably saying over and over that he let this pig fuck him. Between sobs he finishes the story. They found out he took the pig and sent security in to take the pig away from him and because he had it outside the lab for so long and umm... other stuff. They fucking euthanized the pig and fired the guy (obviously). \n\nI didn't know what to do. So I just put some money on the counter, flashed the bartender a terrified look and walked away. Leaving that poor dude, just head down sobbing on the bar top. \n\nAnd you know. As much as that story is really fucked, he had been carrying that shit around for 40 years. I hope telling it brought that dude some kind of peace.\n\nfin",

Two stories that I can mostly recall:\n\nThe first was quite literally out of nowhere. There was a young well-built gentleman who was stone-cold sober sat at the bar and had only had about half a beer before he described in graphic detail how he and his best friend had gotten into a terrible car accident three months ago. He had to watch his friend die while he was suffering from a broken collarbone, arm, and femur. He was the only customer as we had just opened. There weren’t any tears though just, talking. It was a harrowing moment, to say the least, and I can only wish I did well enough to just listen and be present. Still to this day I truly hope the best for him. \n\nThe second was not entirely the very first time I met this person, but this was the time when we first exchanged anything more than the usual bartender pleasantries. It was Mother’s Day and he was asking about what I did this year and I told him I was taking my mother out for lunch the next day I had off. He then dropped a tidbit that this was going to be the third year he would be spending time with his mother for Mother’s Day. Now, this guy was maybe 5-6 years older than me, very well off, he was in charge of installing masts on yachts. I enquire further as to why he might not have been seeing his mother, I wondered if she lived far away. “No, I just wasn't allowed to see her, we didn't start seeing one another until I was older and even now I'm not sure I can trust her.” my mind immediately changed gears for the realm of possibilities a sentence like that can conjure. \n\nI certainly didn't expect to hear that when He was 7-9 years old and was with his mother in Mexico to visit family. That he was kidnapped by the cartel for 2 days, escaped barefoot, hid in a ditch while his abductors searched for him. Made his way to a bodega, who by grand providence happened to be family friends with HIS family in Mexico. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the exact circumstance as to how or when he was taken, or even how it was recognized as his mother's fault. At the time when he was telling me this story, it began with not just mother's day but why he would never return to Mexico. He was raised by his family in California while his mother was taken care of by another part of her family elsewhere. It was a very chilling story and I never saw this fellow again since they were in the process of moving.\n\n--\n\nNow all of this to say, I'm intent on not expressing too many details, mostly due to my memory being pretty shit but also out of personal sympathy I have for my patrons, I’d prefer not to betray their trust. This is the information I feel is within the range of that trust.",

I asked the woman if she felt bad about knowing where the girl was, knowing the family have wanted answers for years. She said she was “loyal to her man” and wouldn’t talk about it to cops. All the facts leads to this woman’s statement being the truth. I told the sheriffs office after, but they can’t get a valid warrant to survey the property. I know the poor girl is buried there, it just makes me sick that she likely won’t be found because the owners are so adamant about no police on their property.

We had just finished the Jameson tour in Dublin, and were hanging out in a park trying to figure out what to do next when this guy walks up to us and introduces himself. This dude was in a disheveled suit and had a strong Russian accent. It was kinda hard to understand him, but from what I did decipher, he worked in the morgue/coffin business and would help the russian mob get rid of bodies. He also had strong ties to Putin and had a bunch of dirt for helping Putin disappear some bodies which helped set him up nicely abroad. After all this he pulls out a half bottle of cheap vodka and offered some. \n\nWe were young, dumb, and traveling abroad for the first time so none of us really thought anything of it. Looking back, all I can think is what a weird and strange interaction that was. \n\nPS - I was the only one to take him up on his offer lol.",

Then, as soon as the customer/s turned their back and were *almost* out of earshot, he'd flip his hands under and over, flip the customer the double-bird, blow a raspberry.

He never tried to pull the ego alpha male stuff with me though, so I actually liked him well enough. I went out and got a drink with him one night and out of nowhere he confided in me that when he was 15 he had some inappropriate sexual contact with some very young girls during a sleepover birthday party his sister was having. I want to say the girls were in the 10-12 age range. He actually ended up turning himself into the police for it, and since he was minor and I’m assuming no penetration of any sort occurred (he made it seem like it was specifically inappropriate touching), I don’t think he was arrested. \n\nI think he told me because it’s something that still weighs heavily on him and must have felt like he could trust me not to tell anyone. Which is weird because we know many of the same people.

But he only forced her the 1st time, when she did it after that it was her choice, and at least he waited for her to be older before actually doing something with her, since 16 (or 15 i don't remember) is the sexual majority in France it was ok.\nAt the end of the night she insisted to help us clean the room we did that in (and broke my lamp...) before wanting to go home by car, even though she couldn't walk straight.

The bloke I was interviewing started telling me about how he murdered his ex wife, cut open her belly and tried to find his wedding ring in her intestines as she has swallowed it during an argument (I later found out from his parole release documents that she was also schizophrenic). It was literally the only thing he really said to me the whole interview. Between him finishing the story and the other three coming back into the room, about 2-3 mins elapsed where we just looked at one another. It was a trip.",

He walks in one day with the folder, I've spoken to this man twice, and won't leave until I take it (and some starbucks gift cards which I just left for someone else). I read the files, of course. He was being taken to court for domestic abuse, and it was so bad that if he wanted to see his daughters it had to be in a room with a supervisor equipped to handle a situation gone awry. His ex wife had a restraining order on him. Thankfully he left me alone when I flat out told him I was uncomfortable talking to him.\n\nAnother time, at a different retail job, I was talking to this woman who has worked there forever but who I hadn't really worked with before. It's mother's day, and she asks what I'm doing for my mother. I don't talk to her for various reasons, so I'm honest with this coworker and say as much. She goes on to tell me that she adopted some young girls whose birth mother let her boyfriend molest her daughters as infants, for drugs or something. And that she forced these girls to see their birth mother regularly, even when they didn't want to. No mention of whether these girls had abuse counseling.

One evening, I've been assigned the local free City bus that done a circuit from the local ferry port, around the town then back again, was usually a very easy if very boring shift.\nIt was getting towards the end of the night (around 11pm ish) and I was on my last circuit when I picked up a teenage girl who was about 16 or 17 ish. Big empty coach but she chooses to sit directly behind me, ok no big deal, maybe she's just awkward about sitting elsewhere. I get to one of the stops and I'm a bit early so I need to wait a few mins. This girl then immediately blurts out the sentence 'Do I look like I could give a good blowjob?'\nI'm stunned into silence but eventually managed to stutter a response somewhere along the lines of 'I've no idea'\nShe then starts telling me about how her boyfriend said she doesn't give good blowjobs so she needed to practice more but also wanted another guys opinion. I had a girlfriend at the time and was also very aware of how young she was so I did my best to try steer the conversation away from oral sex by asking things like what's she had been up to that day etc but she immediately steered it back to giving head. All the time in sat watching my clock praying for the time where I can get moving again. Eventually the conversation stops and we enter an awkward silence for about 2 minutes, then she simply got up and walked off the coach into the night, never said a word, just left.\nSuper fucking awkward.",

I was so excited to start working at a bakery and learning from her.\n\nSecond day of training, it was always just us alone, a political commercial came on the radio and she blurts out “I can’t believe they ever let a Black man be President that’s disgusting. I’m ashamed.” This was in 2019. I didn’t even have any idea what to say, it was blatantly racist like she thought I would agree with her because I’m a white girl?\n\nI really needed the money so I had to stay and I wanted the experience.\n\nWeeks later she told me how she was raped on a date with a guy when she was 18 but it was “no biggie” (she acted like it was her fault).\n\nShe told me her Aunt had a seizure in her living room and started vomiting so she performed CPR on her while she was vomiting into her mouth until the paramedics came but she was DOA. She died in her arms.\n\nShe told me her and her husband hadn’t had sex in years.\n\nShe told me she didn’t think her mother was her biological mother, she thinks her aunt was and that her mother wanted a baby SO BADLY she convinced her sister to give her up because she had been trying to conceive for years. She said it was such a well kept secret in the family that people were afraid of being killed for letting the secret out and now all of them have passed away so she couldn’t do a DNA test but looks just like her aunt. She showed me photos.\n\nShe told me that after she beat breast cancer her chemo treatments and everything had given her lumps in her anus that made it hard for her to poop....and many other details of her bodily functions.\n\nThere’s more I’m sure I’m forgetting about here but you can imagine I felt pretty effing bad for the lady even though she was an intense racist.

Apparently he had walked in on his mother fucking the family dog and his father filming. I was obviously horrified but let him tell me how scarred he was by the experience and told him I was there if he ever needed to talk about it. However a few weeks after the camp ended we met back up with some of our friends from the camp for a dance (funded by the people who made the camp). He seemed kind of down and our friends asked him what was wrong and to my HORROR he starts telling them about his mom fucking his dog. Everyone just looked kind of awkward and left us alone for the rest of the night. I come to find out later from a mutual guy friend that he tells this story to everyone he meets regardless of how long he’s known them. I distanced myself soon after but let him know that if he needed anything I’d be there for him. His parents also picked him up from both the camp and the dance.",

Then he started a monologue on how he drinks cow's blood that he gets from a neighboring butcher every time there is a slaughter as (according to him) drinking animal blood helps humans stay grounded. After that, he started talking about some of his customers paying him with sexual favors and how his best customers are ”horny milfs” (won't get into the details). By that point, as a female (19yo at the time) I was already completely uncomfortable, constantly texting a friend, and on the verge of jumping out of the car. Unfortunately, I stayed long enough for him to start a rant on how he can't stand gay people. While I remained quiet for 95% of the time prior to this as I did not feel like arguing with him, this is something that always triggers me and I couldn't keep my mouth shut. When he said our country should start killing gays using gas chambers I knew it was time to go, so I asked him to pull off on the breakdown lane, got out of the car, and called friends to pick me up.

All going like the normal induction and appointment making when she just lets out that she wants to quit because her sister just died from a smoking related cancer, she's now looking after her teenage niece, who she didn't want because she doesn't like children and managed to get to her age without them, feels like a terrible person for all of that whilst grieving and was having suicidal thoughts. I got her to contact the out of hours services in the city and we saw her every week whilst she went through quitting. Her doctor wouldn't hook her up with psychological help, or give her an appointment for assessing if she needed antidepressants. We found a way we could do an emergency referral so she could be seen by mental health services bypassing her doctor. But that kept me up at night.

He's a very charismatic guy, so naturally, he strikes up a conversation with her. They have small talk for a little bit, and eventually his date gets brought up very briefly, before she drops one hell of a bomb on him. \n\nShe then just dives into this intense story about her SIGNIFICANTLY older on again off again boyfriend. She talks about how she first met him when she was 12 and he was somewhere in his mid 30s, and she had feelings for him since then. So eventually they started dating when she turned 17. She goes on for a little bit about how she is definitly a very jealous partner, which leads to a few years later when the two of them had this huge blow out and broke up for some time. Eventually she and a friend of her's were at a Walmart and saw him with his new GF, so of course she pretended like she didn't see him but started stalking the two of them throughout the store. \n\nEventually the new GF went out to the car for something so she and her friend follow the new GF out side. The driver woman told her friend something along the lines of, \"I'm going to fuck her up.\" So she just runs up behind the new GF and tackles her to the ground and starts beating the shit out of her, banging her head off the cement and all. A few moments later the friend grabs her and drags her off of the new GF and basically pins her to the ground and yells for the other woman to run away, which she gladly does. \n\nThe driver continues on by telling my friend, and I quote, \"If my friend didn't get me off her I was going to kill that bitch, ya know? Like what would you have done in my shoes?\" My friend is just sitting in the back of this car trying to stay as calm as he could, nodding along and agreeing with her as to not upset this almost murderer. She then continues by saying, \"About a week after that he and I got back together again and on the first time we saw each other after I saw him at Walmart I said to him, 'You're my old man, and I'm your old lady, ain't nothin gunna ever change that, got it?'\" \n\nAgain my friend is nodding along and doing his classic \"Mhmm yeah totally\" agreeing line which to an untrained ear actually sounds like he's agreeing with you. She then finishes the story with one final, \"God I really wanted to kill that bitch, if I ever see her again, I still might, I don't know.\"\n\nSo about a minuet after she pulled up to his house and he as politely as he possibly could thanked her for the ride, and got the hell out of her car. He didn't know tips and ratings were anonymous at the time, so needless to say, he gave her a 5 star rating and a very generous tip, so he didn't have her trying to kill him next.",

He made some bad life and financial decisions which have caused his family a great deal of trouble.\n\nIt quickly escalated into him repeatedly looking over the front at me, at times  sobbing and it started freaking me out since we were on the freeway and this man clearly wasn’t focusing on the driving. He attempted to take out his phone to show me his daughter’s picture and I had to remind him sternly to focus on the road and that I’d look at the pictures when we stop.\n\nI calmed him down, appreciated him for figuring things out and trying to correct them and the conversation died down.\n\nI didn’t mind being the one he vented out too; but it always is freaky when people go 0-100 in opening up to their biggest fears/regrets.",

So she ended up getting a dog, to help her getting over that, and eventually really started to bond with this poor animal… And she went a bit too far. She taught the dog how to lick her… Butterfly, if I may. Allegedly it was to compensate the lack of a lover.

            "text": "So, I don't' know if this is entirely on point. Thirty years ago I was working in the Seychelles as a consular officer. You can imagine. I was young, in my twenties, and it was pretty sleepy. Old rich guy loses his passport. Sailor gets sick.  Child of U.S. citizens born.. One  day this guy comes in, I read him as just a boat bum: ruffled hair, deep tan, oft-mended sailors' shorts. And so he was: a boat bum, sailing around the world on a pittance in a rough little sail boat. I invite him into my office (this was pre-9/11, security was more relaxed) offer him coffee (this is the Seychelles..) and ask what I can do for him. He warms up by telling me he'd left LA a year and a half ago, sailing slowly across the Pacific.. \"So what can I do for you, sir?\" I ask, and he replies: \"I needed to introduce myself to you. Somebody is trying to kill me and if it happens you will immediately know who did it. Because I will tell you right now..\"\n\nIt turns out that he was in Tahiti at some anchorage and there was an American couple there too, and as sailors do, they got chummy. It was a couple, an older guy and a younger, \"cute\" wife/girlfriend.. He soon learned she was the girlfriend. So they fraternized there, he sailed on, they got to another island in Polynesia, ran into each other again, and one night he brought over a special bottle of scotch and between the wine of the couple and my interlocutor's scotch they get pretty hammered, start talking about life, how they got into sailing.. etc.. At some point the husband goes below deck and the girlfriend starts telling him how they *really* got to achieve their dream of sailing to Bora Bora.\n\nThe older man/husband had been a businessman in San Francisco. He'd bought their boat with a boat partner. \"Way more boat than he could afford, but with a boat partner, you get twice the boat, right?\" They were friends, in the same circles, in SF. So once they get the boat the older guy convinces his boat partner that he intends to sail to Alaska, so they trick it out for blue water cruising, spend almost a year doing this.. Then one day it's all ready, it's the guy's turn to take the boat for a week out into the Pacific, and he dumps his wife, picks up his girlfriend, loads a ton of provisions up, and sets sail for the Galapagos Islands (!)  So basically, he's just stolen his boat partner's half of his sailboat.\n\nAt this point the older dude comes back on deck (he was below decks, remember), he's pissed that his girlfriend has let the cat out of the bag. It's not immediately clear how pissed, but as the night rolls on, the guy in my office in Seychelles realizes that the older dude is trying to steer him into thinking the girlfriend was joking.. then figure out how long he was going to be at that anchorage, then where he was going next. He starts getting this weird vibe. \"Like this guy was going to kill me.\"\n\nAt first they tried to turn it into a joke. The boat partner in SF was rich. He wouldn't miss the money.. He'd collect insurance. They'd never find the boat, as the boat partner would peg him in the Pacific Northwest because he'd never discussed a circumnavigation. Then it got pretty dark. Pretty scary.. And my interlocutor begins to realize this is not a good situation. He knows too much and he's in the middle of nowhere with these people who have robbed a half-million dollar boat and could easily make him disappear.\n\nLong story short. He rows back to his own boat. Sleeps uneasily. In the morning the formerly friendly vibe has gotten really ugly with the other couple. Not just ugly. But scary. The girlfriend looks super scared when they talk again. Invites continue, but they're really weird, he's just being pumped for information, like they're trying to get him drunk, like they want to know if they can convince him to sail with them someplace isolated. A wind came up in the afternoon when they were ashore. My man just sails right out of the anchorage. And for the next six months as he sails from Polynesia, then south and west, he finds out they're chasing him through the islands. They chase him for a year, all the way through Indonesia and the Indian Ocean to Diego Garcia.\n\nSo in Seychelles he visits me with a simple message. He gave me an envelope with the name of the couple (as he knew their name, and he thought it was right, but he wasn't sure). And he told me they'd been catching up with him.  He'd heard through the grapevine they'd asked for him at Diego Garcia. (A US navy base which tolerates sailors going through.) He didn't trust \"the authorities\" but he was willing to take a chance on me. If I didn't get a postcard from Cape Town within sixty days I was to assume he was murdered, contact his family, and report the name of the boat and his pursuers to the authorities.\n\nAbout two months later I got his postcard from South Africa. So I knew he survived. At least until Capetown.",

I refused to hug him and told him I'm not a big hugger. I saw him again at the restaurant my husband goes to and he tried to hug someones \\~10yr old daughter and she also avoided him. I felt bad for the girl because her dad was calling him \"Uncle\" to her. I ran into him again without my husband and he didn't even say hi, he just stared at me and said \"give me a hug\".

            "text": "I used to teach guitar a little just to earn some extra cash. I never advertised and it was mostly other parents from my kids’ school and friends of the family who had seen my then 9 year-old daughter (who was/is a bit of a prodigy and more talented than I ever was) playing in school assemblies or whatever and found out she’d learned from her dad. \n\nI was randomly contacted one day by the mother of a thirteen y/o girl who had said that her daughter was going through a rough period and the only thing she seemed interested in was music, they’d bought her a guitar and she wasn’t really getting anywhere with the books and early-era YouTube lessons, so could I please come have a chat and see if she’d like to learn from me. \n\nWhen I got there I was greeted by a very emo-looking girl hiding behind her hair and struggling to make eye contact with anyone, and also with clear signs of self-harm on her forearms. I mentioned her Metallica t-shirt, and started showing her (on acoustic) the beginnings of enter sandman and nothing else matters, and she almost couldn’t contain her excitement — she was like a different person and for the next 40 or so minutes, with her mum watching from the kitchen I actually got her doing a passible version — at least something she could work on — of both intros. \n\nHer mum was delighted, and followed me out to my car, gave me some cash that I hadn’t even asked for and was raving about how I was just what her daughter needed. Great...\n\n...except without even pausing for breath she went into way too much detail about how her daughter had been being abused by the mother’s ex-boyfriend for the last 5 years without her knowing and that her and her daughter were having a tough time because the daughter (13 y/o, mind you) had been convinced that her and her stepfather were actually a couple. She’d ended up despising her mother (the one telling me the story) and blaming her for ‘splitting them up’ when she finally managed to get the guy convicted for what he was doing to the daughter. \n\nI was completely shell-shocked and felt like I shouldn’t have been privy to all that detail, ever. \n\nThe sad thing was, I was torn between thinking that I could help this poor girl develop something that could offer her an outlet and catharsis, and “I don’t want any part of that particular mess”. I went and spoke to my wife and my older sister and they both convinced me I should give her lessons, just maybe I should suggest doing it in a group with a few other students and I should definitely tell the mother not to divulge anything about their personal lives to me again beyond what was relevant to her guitar journey.\n\nI didn’t know how to bring it up with the mother, so I called her back and asked if I could meet up for a chat and we agreed to meet at a coffee shop that’s actually in the local library. \n\nThis is where it gets weird. She (the mother) turned up looking quite glammed-up. I didn’t think anything of it though until I started picking up funny little body language things, but I was doubting and telling myself to not be paranoid — that was until a guy who works there and I know fairly well said to me “it looks like you’re on a date” when I went to the counter. She was fully leaning in, flicking her hair and touching my hands across the table at any opportunity. I kept dropping the words “my wife” and “our kids” and such into the conversation and figured she’d got the message by the end of the meeting, but I didn’t feel we’d addressed the actual issue about boundaries because I had been trying to solidify another, different boundary for the whole conversation. \n\nThen it got even weirder. After a few completely factual/non-personal texts back and forth it was agreed that I’d teach her daughter a few days later. I had the bright idea that I’d take my own daughter along because a) she could help with guitar and b) it should nip anything inappropriate (in either sense) in the bud from the get-go — no one is going to discuss that stuff in front of a 9/10 y/o girl and it would give me a shield if the mother was doing what I thought she might have been doing in the meeting.\n\nHowever, when I got there, the daughter herself was dressed like she was a twenty-something going to a nightclub and there was a weird tension between both mother and daughter that was making me and my little girl uncomfortable (I could tell). We did about 15 minutes and I wasn’t getting anywhere teaching the girl anything, so I made excuses and left. It felt like mother and daughter were trying to get my attention and it got oddly competitive at some points. It was all wrong. \n\nThe next day I text the mother saying that I didn’t think I could actually do anything to help, and suggested a music school that has premises in the nearest town to her. \n\nI received about 30 texts back from the mother that ranged from first telling me that I was the only person her daughter had warmed to in a year and that she had been so excited to learn from me, to — by the end — flat out calling me unprofessional and unreliable. I blocked her number eventually as it was like she was stream-of-consciousness texting AT me and I couldn’t keep up!\n\nShe also apparently posted all over social media that I had “made both her and her daughter uncomfortable” and implying that I was the one being “off” — I didn’t directly see these posts as I am not connected with her on any platform, but was being sent screenshots by people who do know me. They were pretty accusatory in tone without directly saying anything. \n\nI dread to think what could have happened. I actually have never taught any guitar to anyone other than my own children, ever again to this day. I also went and reported the whole thing to the police.",

All in all the conversation lasted 40ish mins, my coworker and me just standing there agreeing to him as he'd talk for 5 whole minutes rambling on and on about the history of the land or fishing or his thoughts about FEMA (who we were subcontracted for). We'd get a word in every so often but then he'd take up the entire convo again. His friend eventually went BACK INSIDE after 10 mins into the conversation. Eventually, we asked him if we could go on his property and he was like sure and we finally slipped away (40 mins no cap). Later on were taking a break from work, eating on the side of the road and he drives by and waves. I say to my coworker \"thank god he just drove by\".\n\nAbout 10 mins later he drives by again, and PARKS NEXT TO US. We then talk small talk for ab 5 mins but then it starts getting proper weird.

Turns out, in WWII there *was* a holocaust, but he was only killing the 'bad' Jews. We didn't have a war because of the aggressive expansion, or the genocide. We had a war because Germany and Japan didn't want to be part of the Word Bank, which angered the 'evil' Jews, who in turn spun the wheels of the world's war machine to crush their opposition. \n\nIt was all downhill from there. The moon is a projection on the interior of our Truman-show style dome, which encases our flat earth for 'safety reasons.'\n\nYes. Flat. Apparently, \"the equations work both ways,\" and I'm supposed to assume that every photo or video of a spherical Earth is fake because I haven't been in space and seen the curve myself.\n\nThe classic no-vaxx vegan shit was the worst, though. His wife had to take their kids to a no-contact shelter to get them vaccinated, after which he tried to take her to court for *kidnapping and child endangerment.* I'm told the judge literally laughed at him.\n\nHe tried to tell us that because you are what you eat, we were all dead, because we ate dead things. Fucking bonkers.\n\nHe wasn't just vegan, either, he was *raw* vegan, which is a lot worse. He stated that he had unlocked his ancestral memories while shrooming, and he had re-lived the first instance of cooking in human history, which he called \"The Fall.\" I tried to make him understand that cooking allowed us to net more calories from our food, as opposed to burning them all on chewing; without this, we wouldn't have language, math, architecture, you know, science.\n\nFWIW I'm down with the ancestral memory thing, DNA can store 215 million GB a gram.

Due to COVID and stimulus payments, most fast food places in my town no longer stay open so late because they no longer have the personnel to man them. So...I ended up in a lonely diner. \n\nThere were only two workers manning this diner, but that wasn’t a problem, because there was only one other customer there and he was busy chatting up the only waitress while he sat at the counter with a cup of coffee between his hands. \n\nAfter the waitress took my order, he tried to continue talking to her, but she told him she’d have to begin filling my order. He then turned to me and stated that Arizona had just completed their recount of the 2020 presidential votes and that they found that there indeed were problems with the votes - so many that Trump actually HAD won Arizona, which meant that he had actually won the presidential bid. He went on to say that after seeing the results of the Arizona recount, Wisconsin was going to do a recount of their own. Regardless, he said, Trump actually won the election and by June, July at the latest, he wound again be president and would be back in the Whitehouse. \n\nThis was terribly disturbing to me (I am by NO MEANS a Trump fan), mainly because I was wondering how I had missed such alarming news. \n\nHe then went on to say “And when Trump’s back in office, the first thing he gonna do is go after all the Satanists!” Wait...uh...WHAT?!?!\n\nHe saw the puzzled look on my face, so he continued, “oh yeah — most people don’t know it, but the Satanists have a base hidden on the moon. And they use it to control satellites around the Earth that shoot lasers and blah, blah, blah.” (At this point my ears had shut down and I let him ramble on and on about Satanists, pedos, and how Trump was gonna save us from them all).\n\nThe thing is, this guy looked and seemed so perfectly normal up till then. \n\nAs I was leaving the diner, I passed another guy coming into the diner that was surely letting his *freak flag* fly (multi-colored Mohawk hairdo, nail polish (different color for each finger), and a generally creepy vibe about him). The whole experience reminded me of a rap song from the 80s: “The Freaks Come Out at Night”.",

I guess I’m the definition of this question, lol. I’ll tell you everything and not care. It’s not a closeness thing. It’s more a self defense thing, I guess. Maybe. Not really.  I don’t know.

You know, normal human stuff. \n\nYes, I kept having to tell him to stop talking about self harming, but I thought we could have had a nice casual relationship. \n\nUntil I guess he couldn’t wait any longer and he did it, in front of me. Well, webcam. It’s like he thought if I saw it, I would be amazed or something. No! I was pissed. And I turned off the webcam. Then left. \n\nI probably shouldn’t have left. But, I needed time to think of what to do next. My decision was to stop talking to him. I didn’t want to. But, I had a feeling he would have kept doing it. It’s one to do it on your own time. Fine.

We started talking and had a really easy-going conversation. At some point, she starts telling me about how she got kidnapped and was almost (literally) shipped in a container to a different country. Apparently she met some girl who became her friend for more than a year, and when they were close enough, that girl faked a meeting and conspired to her kidnapping. It turns out that the whole thing was part of a human trafficking operation led by some serious crime organization, and that girl was told to gain her trust, get close to her and eventually aid in the kidnapping. Long story short, she got kidnapped for a couple of days but, somehow, her dad had past acquaintances related to another past crime organization and word got out to the current boss of the trafficking operation. It seems like her dad knew somebody important enough in that world that they arranged her freedom, quite literally before she was about to be moved to another city and be shipped in a container.\n\nShe told me more stories, but I think that one is enough. I never saw her again after that day and, if I may add, we found out we had so many things in common (obviously not the kidnapping) that we got to that level of trust even in a first time conversation.

About 8 or 9 years ago I was chilling with two friends of mine, sharing a joint while we walked aimlessly around the fields behind my friend's property. We weren't chatting about anything in particular when suddenly one of my friends stopped in his tracks, slowly looks up at my other friend and I and says, \"guy's there is something that I did that was really wrong and I need to tell someone\" ..now we were all in our late teens at this point in time so I'm thinking maybe he swiped some money from his mom's purse for some drugs or something...I was way off. The other friend and I assured our buddy that he could confide in us (that was a mistake). He then proceeded to say \"I fucked my cat\". The other friend and I looked at each other with shock and confusion. The first thing that came out of my mouth was \"Well.. is she okay now?!\". He then stated that his cat was a bit shook up but there were no apparent health concerns. Then, almost immediately, our shock turned to awkward laughter because it was so out of the blue and the look on my friend's face (the cat fucker) was ironically serious and hilarious. We weren't sure if he was joking or not at first so we were kinda messing around with him in disbelief..minutes later he confirmed that the story is true. The other friend and I stopped hanging out with him on a regular basis and then stopped hanging with him completely. \n\n  Out of all of the confessions that I have heard in my life, the cat fucker takes the cake for most disturbing/off-the-wall. Turns out the guy was diagnosed with severe schizophrenia sometime after that incident.  I knew him since grade school and he had never been a violent or \"cat fucker\" type person, just a little odd. Unfortunately I witnessed his oddness slowly turn into insanity when our friend group started messing around with psychedelics and hard drugs. I wish I would have seen the signs as a teen and encouraged him to stay away from substances but I was so wrapped up in my own addiction that I didn't add it all up till years later. I ran into him a few months ago and \"cat fucker\" was the first thing that popped into my head when I saw him. Wish he never told us. I can't imagine what compelled him to defile his cat and I'm still horrified for the poor cat victim.",

Female middle aged customer married a guy after having lost her husband to a heart attack a year or so prior. He seemed like a great man, real estate developer in Florida, lots of money and treated her like a queen. Then they get married and move down to Florida where he essentially became a monster overnight. He beat, raped, and tortured her daily, belittled her and made her feel as if she was lower than pond scum. Yet she was the one who \"deserved it\" according to him for not being a model wife or some bullshit like that. After she was able to sneak away and use her cell phone to call her mother she finally snuck out with help from her help who drove 500 miles to aid in escaping. Divorce happened soon after, which she didnt talk about.\n\nAll I did was walk out around the counter to the sales floor and hugged her, where she collapsed in my arms sobbing. It's been 10 years since I heard that story and I still well up with tears whenever I think about it. I hope shes doing ok now.",

I was shocked and asled her what the fuck is wrong with her. She just said that me bringing up my cousin reminded her of those moments. I asked why it even happened and she said: \" She was about eleven at the time and was much stronger than me. So one day she came up and kissed me. I was schoked and didn't know what to do. When she came back for another go I stepped away and told her no. She told me yes and that if she told anyone she would tell her parents that she was trying to inappropriately touch her and what not.\" Of course being seven or eight she was too frightened to do anything and the forced kissing went on for several weeks until one point where her cousin locked the both of them in a room and ordered her to take her clothes off. My ex stated at that point she had enough and that she ran out the room and the two haven't spoken or seen each other since.

Eventually I got her phone number and we texted via WhatsApp. We knew us for like a week and then she started telling me about her \"plans\" of getting a child and if it's a girl, she'd abort it. But if it's a guy, she'd make him play osu for his entire life until he's 16 and then she'd have sex with him. Or in her words \"pressing on circles, that will be his entire life. And when he's 16, he'll press my circles\". I really thought about calling the police on her but she's only 15 (just like me) so I'm pretty sure that she's gonna have other plans in the future. Also, I wouldn't want to have to explain that to the police and also, I showed it to a female classmate a few days later and she laughed her ass off saying that was some funny joke (and, as you might already be able to tell, they are pretty similar, but not too similar).",
