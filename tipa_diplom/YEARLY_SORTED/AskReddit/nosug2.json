If they're all working together they're going to be hard to quell, not unlike the Earth Spirits they represent. \n\nThere are a number of enormous Buddhas and Guanyin in Asia, but Idk how much a \"hostile\" Buddha is going to rage out. Would this curse override the innate nature of the depicted person/creature? If so, most of Asia is FUCKED.\n\nThere's a handful of huge \"Our Lady of\" someplace/things depicting the Catholic virgin. She was reportedly in life born without sin and the only perfect vessel for the Christian savior, but I imagine if this curse overrides that perfection most of the cities in South America are in trouble as well. \n\nManhattan's just hosed anyway, but especially if Lady Liberty wakes up. The airport is, like, *right there*, plus Wall Street, Grand Central terminal. She could go through most of the 5 Boroughs like knocking down Lego towers.

Russia's also got an absolutely massive statue of a woman, and there are plenty of large Buddhas out there. Also, at least the ones shaped like humans would move in predictable ways. What the heck would the more abstract statues do? Would pedestals and other more decorative elements come to life, too? If so, then the statues might not actually be all that dangerous as long as you stayed out of their reach. I can't imagine having a single, blocky foot makes for good mobility. Also, do bas reliefs count? Or only if they're part of a free standing statue? If reliefs count, we may end up with a significant fraction of official buildings being unusable, given how much decorative work there is on many of them. In fact, being cut off from various libraries, hospitals, and university and government buildings might prove to be deadlier, even if we regained access fairly quickly. Rock and metal are things we can deal with, given time. The social disruption might actually be worse.\n\nUnless they remain animated when broken. Then we're fucked.",

We can break those weapons (and the statues themselves) with a hammer or something that can break them without making the debris fly everywhere. \n\nSmall statues (eg mouse statues): They can build up and pile on something or someone and multiply to attack us, we would have to wack a mole them or execute a bunch at the same time. \n\nBird statues: If they can somehow fly, they would be very dangerous. They would be essentially flying bullets, so we would have to be careful,  wear protective gear and trap them or take them down some way without causing debris. Even if they can’t fly, they could still sneak around and peck us with a metal/copper/whatever else statues are made out of beck and slap us with those wings. So, we also have to remember to aim for the head, wings and beck (Though aiming for the head would probably make the beck useless). \n\nWe also have to learn how they came alive, how to stop them and keep in mind the statues that have a glass or other components that can also be harmful.  One more thing, don't beat yourself for being anxious, not ready for this, even if you are prepared, being in the situation is not the same as thinking about it.

If they just slug each other around with offensive and defensive properties commensurate with their size and composition, *The Motherland Calls* probably wins.  She's one of the largest statues in the world to begin with, but she's also solid concrete war memorial with a steel sword.\n\nIf size is the only relevant trait, the *Statue of Unity* wins because it's so damn huge.  Its core is also reinforced concrete, which presumably you'd have to break to kill it.\n\nMount Rushmore might also qualify.  If a proportional body for the four heads tore itself up from the ground, you'd be looking at a 480 foot granite titan.  That's not quite as big as *SoU*, but roughly twice the size of *TMC*.  If the heads inherit their personalities from the corresponding presidents, you'd end up with a *lot* of bickering, and depending on whether Lincoln and Washington step in, either Jefferson or Roosevelt will end up the primary pilot of their shared body.  Jefferson running the show shouldn't be too bad.  Roosevelt on the other hand...  Well, America would be fine, at least.  Can't say the same for anywhere else in the world.\n\nNow, if the statues become *real*, as in gain the powers of whatever they're depicted to represent, while you have Godzilla and Gundam statues in Japan, Brazil's *Christ the Redeemer* wins by default because it would be literal God.

She was an unauthorized replica of a statue known as Nirvana, also in Washington, D.C.  Nirvana was created as the memorial statue for Marian Hooper Adams, who purportedly was unable to conceive, which contributed to her depression and suicide. Marian's spirit is said to possess Black Aggie, causing it to come to life with firey glowing eyes and strangle people or stab them with her shears. Legend has it that Marian's spirit was angered by her sacred memorial being copied and used at someone else's grave, so she is forever seeking revenge. Marian's spirit also mskes pregnant women miscarry because she does not want any other woman to bear children since she could not.\n\nSo, yeah, a statue possessed by a pissed off spirit is going to be pretty damn hard to kill.",

So small that you most likely do not notice them. And it large groups, they become more dangerous. And are able to use the element on suprise against its enemies. So explosives might not be that effective, and the speed of the small statues would be largely increased because of the weight.\n\nThe Statue of Unity is able to tank alot of damage and kill alot of enemies. But he will not survive the longest time. He would be beaten by small statues in groups in survival record time. The statue would immediately be focused on by nations, and later destroyed. He would be more of a distraction then actually a large threat. In my opinion.  \n\n\nSmall statues can be maybe destroyed using the explosives. But they can hide and without us humans knowing where they can be. We wouldn't be able to destroy alot of them without wasting explosive equiqment. And they can easily kill their enemy. They're fast making them faster too dodge any incoming lethal weaponary. And can dig fast in sand or dirt. Using that to an advantage. The element of suprise, and speed is used with the small statue.

I knew that in this morning’s meeting, the bombing would be central topic. I needed a position.\r  \n\r  \nWhat I came up with is on topic for the question, and I still believe it true.\r  \n\r  \nTerrorism is a tactic employed by a weaker force against a stronger: In recognition that the stronger force cannot be defeated by direct force of arms, the terrorist demands that we destroy ourselves. That we react to their actions by changing who we fundamentally are, sort of like how a cattle prod cannot destroy a 1500 pound steer, but can make him want to get on the truck to the slaughter house of his own volition.\r  \n\r  \nI think the events of the past 15 years, combined with the present political climate, illustrates the point. The Republican party -and I was a long supporter - is very different than it was in the 2000 election and before. I think they have drawn to themselves those who are reacting to the cattle-prod and racing to get on the truck to the meat-packer. There is even a lead steer, with big hooves, who is leading the way up the ramp.",

No more words were necessary.\n\nThey knew their places.\n\nJesus swung into the driver's seat. It was the only real place for him, and there wasn't another option, when it came right down to it. Buddha didn't fit behind the wheel, and they'd both seen Satan at work on that flask inside his jacket through the day. No, Jesus would handle it.\n\nTheir wheels spun on the gravel. The others were circling, now. It was time. The final battle, the final fight to see who would win the game once and for all. Jesus and Satan teaming up was a given. The other candidates had complained - it wasn't fair - but complaining got them nowhere.\n\nThey all tried to pretend like they weren't going to do the exact same thing as soon as the opportunity presented itself. They looked between each other edgily, sizing the competition up. Picking teams.\n\nBuddha, on the other hand, was a surprise. What incentive did he have for working together with the terrible twosome? His smooth, expressionless face gave no hint of an answer as he clambered all the way up behind the gun mounted in the truck bed. His bare feet were steady on the metal floor, perfectly centered even as his girth swung disconcertingly.\n\n\"Here they come!\" Satan roared. He had elected himself shot-caller, of course, even though they hadn't set teams. Neither of the other two were surprised by that, either. He'd always needed to have the last word on things.\n\nThe first contenders were approaching. Muhammed was out front, leaning out the side door of a torn-up station wagon. He clutched a rocket launcher in his hands. They could see Shiva behind the wheel, grinning like a madcap as he spun the wheel. The overburdened little car nearabouts rode up on two wheels as they whipped into a donut.\n\n\"Shoot! Shoot! Now, goddammit! Why aren't you shooting yet?!\" Satan screamed. Jesus gritted his teeth, choosing to ignore the fact that his father's name was being taken in vain alongside him. Buddha was just watching, sizing up the shot. And then his meaty finger gripped the trigger.\n\nThe roar of the gun was deafening. Satan clapped his hands over his ears, roaring with laughter as the gleaming, glowing rounds arced out towards the station wagon. Shiva was swearing - they could see that much, even though his words were lost to distance and the racket. But they were spinning too fast. The ground between them erupted into shredded sand and mud.\n\nMuhammed wasn't waiting anymore. A plume of fire shot from the rocket launcher.\n\nEverything happened all at once, after that.\n\n\"Satan!\" Jesus cried. He, too, was turning now, but there was only so much he could be expected to do. He was supposed to be positioning them to attack. Defending them was-\n\n\"I got it, I got it! Don't get your robes in a bunch.\" Satan hissed. Defending them was his job. He lurched dangerously in his seat, barely holding on. But he pulled his hand up into an almost-level position, mimicking a gun.\n\n\"Bang.\"\n\nRed circles appeared endlessly around their truck. Something was coming up from underground.\n\n\"Damn it, Satan. Do you have to-\"\n\n\"Don't complain, big guy. Left. Left. Go-\"\n\nThe truck whipped into a left-hand turn, narrowly avoiding the black pillars shooting up around them. Jesus shook his head.\n\n\"I've got it. Stop backseat driving.\"\n\nThe other teams were coalescing, now. One after another, the deities were lining up for the big fight. They all knew. Whoever won this, would win the world. And none of them wanted to lose.\n\nHe could almost see them, if he squinted. Four sets of hooves, barely visible under the cloudline where they floated. Watching. Waiting. The final fight, for whoever crushed the competition here.\n\nHe winced. The little station wagon had just been slammed by a hummer. He could see Ra through the front window, glowing faintly from the shit-eating grin on his face. Oddly noodle-like tentacles were swarming out of the vehicle, attaching themselves to the station wagon. Which seemed to be vanishing into the mass of pasta.\n\n\"Drive! Drive!\" Satan screamed in his ear. The roar of the chaingun from the truck bed was almost a constant companion, now.\n\nJesus grinned, flexing his hands on the wheel.\n\nAnd then he drove.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7d6cjy/wp_jesus_take_the_wheel_satan_get_behind_me/?usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D",

And for those who don't know anything about Jesus, well he's literally God. He's the Son of God, but he's God's Human Form. He's both \"beings\" at once. Don't get my started on angels...Google \"what angels really look like\" and see how scary they are and then remember, these are the good guys. There are statues of Satan, sure, but he's not God's counter part. He's just a fallen arch angel. He's just a mere spec of dust compared to God. So nothing would be a threat.\n\n\nThen you have all the anime figures. Like Dragon Ball Z characters. Some of them could probably blow up the world. But all the powerful good guys would stop them. And the Bulmas are super genius and could just figure out how to make themselves big. And then you have characters like Rick from Rick and Morty. He'd easily figure it out in a few minutes.",

Or perhaps all statues come alive at once but start going hostile like some kind of virus.\n\nIt could have various play styles and genres, such as:\n\n* The players starting area is one of the first (or somewhat early) area to experience the conversion. You would need to survive and save as many as you can. Maybe try to figure out what is going on and how to stop or reverse it.\n* The player is an investigator or military person or something \"official\" and goes to various places or just to the one to investigate/fight back/etc.\n* The player starts after most of the world is ravaged and you have to survive, scavenge, and defend yourself.\n* The hostile statues are contained in an area and somehow the player ends up in that area (e.g. crash landing) and has to survive. This could potentially allow for larger numbers of players, though I am not sure if/how one could make it into an MMO.\n* The player could choose whether to be a statue or a human/native. PVP building defenses and offenses and destroying/sabotaging the other side.\n\nOther ideas? Also consider what constitutes a statue (anamatronics?, action figures?), such that it can come alive. Perhaps the definition could change over time to keep things going, like waves.",
