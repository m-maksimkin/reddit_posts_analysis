I told my SIL you won‚Äôt be worried about infertility if you are dead from covid. I know it‚Äôs harsh to say but really she almost died and she still tries to say covid isn‚Äôt a big deal and now does not want to get vaccinated do you an unproven claim. It‚Äôs so reckless and annoying. I see people dying day in and day out. They are refusing to get vaccinated and insist on going around family members and elderly. It kills me because if one family member didn‚Äôt take to the vaccine and my brother and SIL get reinfected with covid they could kill my grandmother or grandparents all because they are worried about a made up side effects. I also told that same SIL I guess all the women getting their tubes tied should just get a covid vaccine since it causes infertility... I am so done with them all. The worst is I do not want to be around them at family get togethers and haven‚Äôt been except when my mom lied to me saying they weren‚Äôt coming and then proceed to have them show up. I just don‚Äôt go at this point. I don‚Äôt want to endanger the lives of my patients by knowingly going around unvaccinated people.

Just like in others areas of life, there are varying attitudes amongst physicians, and I have many peers who agree with me.\n\nThe data in the effectiveness of cloth masks preventing the transmission of a partially airborne highly infectious respiratory virus in the community is weak at best. And even if they did work. It is curious why some are so desperate to believe they don‚Äôt work both ways (they only prevent the virus from getting out not getting in, which from a biophysics standpoint is highly dubious), so asymptomatic bystanders must be mandated by law to conform to the neuroses of those afraid of a virus with a survival rate well over 99% for all comers that mainly kills the morbidly obese and those near the end of their life who would die from a variety of infectious causes should they contract them. We should be able to discuss what the value of liberty is in this society and make individual risk assessments about what is appropriate. If you are scared you might die from coronavirus, the solution is not to make everyone on an airplane wear a marginally effective (at best) symbol that you can see to calm your nerves, the solution is to not get on an airplane because that is something you are personally uncomfortable with. It‚Äôs an incredibly selfish and dishonest way of thinking. The retort is that X amount have died, don‚Äôt you care about people dying? The uncomfortable truth is that people die from all sorts of things, that is the nature of life and when we leave our house and engage in normal life there will always be risks. If this virus had a 25% death rate we‚Äôd be having a different conversation. But it doesn‚Äôt. No one wants to think about this rationally, and let‚Äôs be honest, there are plenty who love the masks because they are a visual symbol to identify what you believe and they love the fact that they can force other people to wear them in public because they know they hate it. This kind of thinking all goes together. Only the government can determine how you should act, what you should wear, where you can go, and how you should be able to protect yourself and your family, etc.\n\nIt is disingenuous to boil this down to ‚Äúif you question the efficacy of masks or the constitutionality of mandates regardless of efficacy then you must be a rather stupid person and we should shame and make fun of you.‚Äù It is much deeper than that, and what arguments like that really are are ad hominems that try to shut down debates and bully everyone into agreement. There are plenty of my physician colleagues who agree with me, and up until last year when masks became politicized because of mandates based on weak/no data, it was well understood in the scientific community that only fit tested n95 masks conveyed any meaningful level of protection and that surgical masks offered little benefit outside of a healthcare environment, and certainly not homemade cloth masks. What changed? Politics. Was there a study that suddenly showed people can safely engage in normal activities with masks on? No, but there was a randomized trial from Denmark, the Danmask study, that at the very least cast doubt on the efficacy of mask mandates, but it is verboten to discuss it yet we routinely cite far weaker studies on a daily basis.\n\nThe fact that Dr. Fauci is wearing his cute masks with cartoons on it after receiving the vaccine speaks volumes. Yes, you can still get the virus after receiving the vaccine, but the vaccine reduces the odds by orders of magnitudes and significantly lessens its severity of you contract it. So your already extremely low odds of death from the virus are now even more extremely remote. There is no level other than zero that will satisfy Dr. Fauci and the fear mongers because they know there is a decent chance this pandemic will be endemic and the virus will not go away. Does that justify permanent suspension of liberty for the rest of our lives with the government telling you where you can go and what you have to do and wear on public? We lived with smallpox, a far more deadly virus, for a very long time and it was one of the few infectious diseases we were able to eradicate completely with vaccines. Yet we did not shut our societies down and isolate everyone during the process. People died from smallpox. Lots of them. That is the nature of life.\n\nThe whole thing is pathetic. And it‚Äôs especially sad when highly educated doctors tell people they need a vaccine after recently recovering from covid (they don‚Äôt) and that we need to keep wearing masks despite having immunity (we don‚Äôt‚Äô). It‚Äôs obvious there is something else going on. \n\nIf you want to wear a mask in the community, nobody is stopping you. By voluntarily wearing a mask, you are basically saying that you disagree that this virus has any significant aersolized component (it does) as the aerosol cannot be contained by non n95 masks. So if it‚Äôs droplet only, then just stay a few feet away from people without masks on if you are going to be around them for more than a few minutes. Problem solved. Or just get the vaccine and live your life normally without ever worrying about masks or distancing again. Once you get the vaccine, the pandemic is essentially over for you. Period. So stop.",

Got to the Wednesday that we had to close our pub, did the shutdown whilst feeling like death and completed my walk home to climb into bed.\n\nAfter this I got really quite ill and my colleague informed me that he had been diagnosed with Covid, so I had my home test done and sent it off. This is about the only memory I have of this timeframe other than that I tried to call to get myself hospitalised whilst I was waiting for the test results because my breathing was absolutely destroyed. Was refused an ambulance for not being sick enough and spent another 2 weeks unable to leave my bed for anything other than the toilet that would then wipe me out for the next few hours.\n\nI ended up needing to buy a new blanket and pillows because I had fever-sweat so hard that both were completely soaked wet. Ended up losing about 11kgs in the two weeks from where I just couldn't eat anything and was only drinking water.\n\nShortly after this, father couldn't believe that the NHS is so overwhelmed that I couldn't be taken to hospital because there were too many people worse than me.

During thanksgiving when they got covid, they quarantined downstairs but still had 2 of their kids visit who then also got covid. My grandmother then got covid but was thankfully fine. Then while my grandmother and that uncle a couple months later were at the funeral for her brother who had died of covid, my grandpa (84) got covid and had to go to the hospital and was sobbing with fear, and the only person who could take care of him was my mom. Thankfully, my grandpa was released from the hospital a few hours later and is ok, and my mom never got covid. But my ignorant aunt and uncle spread covid around, and I was gonna lose my shit if they ended up killing my grandparents over it. \n\nI talked to them last week. My uncle has had his first vaccination dose, and my aunt and her daughter had their vaccine appointments set. So I guess they now believe in it and are willing to get vaccinated (they were never anti-vaxxers to begin with). \n\nThe thing is, my aunt and uncle are usually good, normal people.

I ask where is was he says band practice...trumpet no less. Kid tests positive. We turn the data over to health dept for co tracing.\n\nCase#2 lady shows up feeling bad, going on about COVID being BS. She tests positive. Tell her family needs to be tested. She said it will ba a while husband has to pick them up from school. 5 kids going to three schools in 2 separate counties. Every one tests positive. Kids are mad saying that they hadn't been feeling well for days, but mom kept sending them to school. Again, we reported all this to the various health departments for contact tracing. Mother was sobbing by the end of it all with the realization of what she had done.\n\nI have dozens of stories like this over the last year. The big issue is that we do 2 levels of testing. Rapid and PCR. If a rapid is positive, they have COVID, however if it is negative, they may still have it as the issue with the rapid tests are that they have elevated cases of false negatives, so in these cases, we back that up with a lab test.\n\nWe have a hard time convincing people thay the negative that they have isnt a negative until the PCR results come back...usually 24-48 hrs later. They here negative and are like \"Wooooo, party time\"\n\nWe have had people getting rapid tests, using that result to go visit grammy, then getting a positive result later. Next thing you know, Grammy is in the ICU and we are getting yelled at by the rest of the family.\n\nI'm blown away by the selfishness I've encountered from the older crowd (Boomers) and the younger crowd...those under 25. That's a generalization, of course, but this is where I'm seeing the most bad behavior with covid.",

Also had some mild nausea without abdominal pain or vomiting. \n\nPatient B, in room #5, is a 51 yo female, medical history of intermittent asthma - so she uses a puffer infrequently, comes in with shortness of breath, has some possible fevers at home. In triage it was noted that this patient's Oxygen sats were in the 88 range and her heart rate wasn't elevated. Interestingly, when asked if she thought she had covid she said \"I can't have it, I tested negative two weeks ago when my son tested positive. He's been sick at home.\"\n\nYou guessed it. Both people covid +. \n\nPatient A went home. He's doing great. Was extremely remorseful and before he'd even left the ED he called his work to let them know he was positive and to get everyone there tested because he figured he had gotten the illness at work (IIRC he worked in a small family-owned warehouse as a foreman). He also called his parents and they were getting him setup to sleep in the garage until his quarantine was up. I respected this guy.\n\nPatient B got admitted to the hospital because her O2 sats weren't great. When I went back to tell her she was covid + she called me a liar and told me I must have made a mistake. She threatened to sign out AMA (against medical advice) but when she got up to leave she got so short of breath the nurse used that to convince her to stay.\n\nPeople are strange sometimes.

I had a two week streak where every day one or two of my patients would die. We'd go up to 3 oor 4 patient assignments (the norm is 2:1 or 1:1 if on certain equipment). \n\nMost all of the patients understood the severity of what they had. A handful didn't believe they had COVID, even though removing hi flow O2 or their BIPAP would put their sats down into the 60s or 70s. Many had comorbidities that put them at risk (COPD/asthma, obesity/sleep apnea, smoking).\n\nI think people would refuse to be intubated because they knew what the outcome would be. Fight, hope, pray, fingers crossed, whatever you want to call it... delaying the inevitable. Our ICU attending would actually have them sign consent for intubation (if they were cognizant enough to do so). Almost all of them died. Very few made it out alive but still so sick and debilitated (some with trachs).\n\nOne guy in particular sticks out. This was right after Christmas.  21 years old hx DM1, obesity, sleep apnea, didn't like to take his insulin. Admitted with COVID. Didn't believe he had it. Should have been tubed days before but refused, then he ended up being intubated emergently. Took about 5 of us to prone him (lay him on his stomach) because his O2 sats were in the 60s. Couldn't get a pulse (noticed no waveform on the art line). Had to flip him back over to do CPR for about an hour or so before we called it. Had a kid and a fiancee. \n\nHonestly, it was more of the families that denied their loved one had COVID. Upset (understandably) about not being able to visit. Zoom calls just don't cut it. \n\nI say this all as my parents (mom/SD and dad/SM) are all covid deniers, even when I tell them what it's like. \"Well those people had other things wrong with them though, they were older\" they tell me.

The facial swelling alone from being prone is enough to give a person nightmares. Watching someone go into multi system organ failure, needing dialysis, unable to put them back onto their back, being maxed out on ventilator settings and that still not being enough to the point of barotrauma and collapsing a lung and needing a chest tube to reinflate it. Families saying \"do everything\" even though they had coded once or twice. Hearing families on Zoom crying, praying, singing as the patient is intubated, sedated, and paralyzed so the ventilator can do the work. Tearing up under all the PPE because yeah, we are still human. We work so hard and sometimes it doesn't fucking matter. But we go back, day after day. I wish people who don't believe could see what I have seen.

The nurses were occupied elsewhere (we were understaffed an way above our normal patient count) but had asked the doctor to come see her and explain. I explained countless times that the doctor would come soon but that I couldn't tell her when exactly since it was late and we had lots of patients, but she didn't want to listen and told her family I was the doctor. Since I was a soldier with something like a week of hospital experience and that I didn't even know her name, I couldn't answer them and instead insisted that she keep her mask on, I thoroughly explained why but she always put it away \"to breathe or talk more easily\".\n\nOf course I told the nurses but with 40 patients to take care of I had to leave her room for something like 5 minutes and when I came back she was unconscious and not breathing properly, so we had to intubate her here, without proper staff or equipment, because the ICU was simply full. I don't know if she survived, when I left my shift, they where still waiting for an ambulance or helo to transfer her to a proper ICU.

Cyanosis of the mouth and nail beds of fingers. Lungs sounds were very diminished and wheezing in all fields. Pale and sweaty. I was very surprised that they were alert and oriented.

I attempted to convince the person let me treat them. Over the course of ten minutes we waited on scene. It felt like forever. The patient spouse plead with them. Frankly, I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I wanted to help this person. Give them oxygen, potentially intubate them. Solumederol maybe Epi and Mag to open up their lungs. But the person kept saying no.

I called our doctor for advice. Legally my hands. As the patient was still of capacity to make decisions we had respect their wishes. And then it happened. The patient went unresponsive.

In the back of our rig, we acquired IV access and intubated the patient. Medications were administered and within ten minutes we were at the hospital. We got them there. A few hours later we stop back at the hospital with another patient. A nurse pulls me a side to update me. Our patient had died shortly after we dropped them off.

We had a young patient (<35 years old) that wasn‚Äôt admitted for COVID, but we were all pretty certain that they had it previously and their lungs were significantly damaged resulting in their admission. \n\nThis patient was on high flow nasal cannula for a while, but progressed to 100% BiPaP (a mask you wear which forces air into your lungs, basically the closest thing you can get to a ventilator without having a breathing tube). This patient would routinely desaturate to less then 30% with their mask off. I am not exaggerating here. Normal pulse ox sats are 92-100%. Incredibly sick patients in respiratory distress coming into the ED can be in the 50-60% range. Again, LESS than 30%, perfect waveform and everything. Unbelievable.\n\nRegardless, the conversation of intubation (breathing tube) was brought up multiple times to the patient and family. The family refused every time, claiming that putting the patient on the ventilator was just the hospital trying to make money off of them. During one of the final conversations with the family, it got so heated that our hospital security had to come and escort the family out after the team pleaded for them to try the ventilator as it was basically the only chance they had in saving the patient. Family didn‚Äôt budge. \n\nA day later the patient coded (heart stopped) and the patient had to be emergently intubated. They were able to bring him back, but less then 24 hours later they coded again and passed away.\n\nI didn‚Äôt directly work with this patient, but it was incredibly frustrating to hear about. Us nurses often joke about the ‚Äúbig nursing bucks‚Äù that we make. Granted, I feel fairly compensated most of the time, but no one in their right mind in the hospital is in it solely for the financial incentive. I have met some absolutely brilliant people working in the ICU who likely could have made 10x their salary working in another field. People dedicate their lives working to hopefully be able to save someone else‚Äôs. The idea that healthcare workers are out here to make money related to the horrific situations of others is absolutely ludicrous.",

The number of people who have rolled their eyes at me when I gown up, or when I have other responders wait outside while I do a quick preliminary to decide if I suspect COVID-19 or not is higher than I can count. The worst though are the people I work with who give me the same reaction. My partner and I saw a lot more COVID-19 patients than most of the crews in our area (we joked that dispatch deemed us expendable, haha) and I've had coworkers say they've never seen a case be that serious. Lucky them. I'll never forget the look on the guy's face when we had to tell him that we couldn't keep him alive for the 10-minute drive home so he could die in his own bed with his own family, leaving him alone in the hospital instead. \n\nMost dramatic one was the drunk person who said they had COVID-19, then tried to deny it. Obviously, I played better safe than sorry (they were REALLY drunk and a few other reasons I wasn't going to trust them) and gowned up. They got pissed enough to rip my respirator off my face and then spit in my face. (Had to get a new respirator after, since they managed to thoroughly break it.)

And this is actually the opposite situation.\n\nSo as you probably know, the vaccines are tested in  clinical trials before they are released. So once the vaccine is approved, or at least emergency approved, we bring all the patients back in for the study and get them vaccinated (the process is different from study to study).\n\nSo when Moderna was released, we brought all the Moderna patients back in, we unblind them, and everyone who got placebo can now have their vaccine. So each patient I see, I ask them (cuz I‚Äôm curious) if they think they got the vaccine.\n\nAs you can probably guess, most people are right. Around 80% can guess if they did or didn‚Äôt have it. The 20% that are wrong are the people who successfully got a vaccine but didn‚Äôt have any symptoms, yes uncommon but it does happen (I‚Äôd ballpark it at 33% of my patients that were vaccinated didn‚Äôt get any symptoms).\n\nWell one day I had a lady who was a known hypochondriac. She was 100% sure she got vaccine. Muscle soreness the next day on both injections, fever, night sweats, nausea, you name it... she had all the symptoms reported TWICE (for both injections).‚Äî no joke... this lady got a placebo.... it absolutely blew her mind.\n\nNeedless to say, she is the butt of every joke at work now.",

My mom wouldn't give much details about how it happened but the patient basically attacked the nurse who was helping her and 2 other nurses and my mother stepped in to help and all 4 of them caught covid from the incident.

I am in hospital administration for a very large health system. I don't do anything even remotely heroic like the doctors and nurses, but being where I am at gives me a huge overview of many cases.  I have seen and heard a lot this past year. I am in a very conservative state and most people around me lean heavily to the right. \n\nOK.. So.. The beginning was interesting because so many were saying that it won't affect our state. It was just a flu. It was man made. But then we started making changes in policies. Temp checks, mandatory masks, construction... We got shit done.\n\nThen we get slammed. It was bad, but it could have been worse. The worst thing with the patients and families were the visitor restrictions. None allowed. People would not believe they had it.. Or the family wouldn't believe it. People died and the family would not believe it. Even a case where it seemed less important that grandpa died... They just didn't want it covid related on the death certificate.  \n\nPeople demanded to see the bodies but couldn't.  Trying to sue the people risking their lives to save their mask hating asses.  During a trip I made to one of our drive through testing centers they told a story of a woman that had a high fever, knew she had covid and 6 members of her family came along for the ride so they could see her get tested. Stupid.\n\nI could literally make this as long as I want. But I will say this.. For my part I didn't handle it well. Almost had a nervous breakdown. No idea how the Drs and nurses stay sane.  But I avoided getting it.. Till December. If I would have made it just 17 more days, I would have gotten my first shot. But nope. Wife got it.. I got it from her. It was bad. I think we both almost ended up in our own ER. But we fought it at home. And she still has issues. \n\nFor me, I had the long lasting brain fog. It was depressing because I was just not myself sometimes. Even had hallucinations. But then, after waiting the required 90 days I got my first Pfizer shot and after I recovered from the shot itself, my brain issues were gone. I am about 100% better now. \n\nAnd that is the footnotes version of my story.",

My grandpa was a farmer and my uncle was the only son of my mother and 4 other aunts so he *promised* to keep the farm going. \n\nGrandpa died. His body wasn‚Äôt even cold in the ground and my uncle auctioned off every piece of farm equipment left in the sheds and the barns. The place looks like a ghost town and the only person left is my grandma. \n\nMy grandparents were born in the 1920s. My grandma is 93. They have seen many things in society change, but they have always taught us to love. They believed in civil rights. My uncle does not. He could barely pronounce his own name during the civil rights movement, yet he knows how to spit out a racial slur. My grandma has in-home care to help her shower and get dressed in the morning, and she has two nurses that rotate each week. One of them is black. Both of these nurses are wonderful to her and she enjoys their company. They call her on the phone outside of work to chat with her. My uncle has said awful things about the black nurse only because of her skin color. I‚Äôve never heard him say a thing about the white nurse.\n\nMy uncle does not ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in education. I‚Äôm in college, and he‚Äôs started sharing a good amount of posts on Facebook that say things like ‚Äújust because you‚Äôre getting an education doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre smart‚Äù and other things like that. My other cousins are significantly older than I am. I‚Äôm the only one in college right now. I‚Äôm his least favorite niece and I‚Äôm proud.\n\n**The COVID part:** As I stated earlier, my grandmother is 93. Right before Christmas, she came down with COVID and was hospitalized. She also had pneumonia and we were uncertain if we‚Äôd ever see her again. We were all very, very worried. My uncle expressed his feelings differently. He threw a fit in the ER lobby demanding to see my grandma. He threw around the term ‚ÄúChina-virus,‚Äù and yelled at the staff that this was all a hoax. My aunt shoved him outside before security got there. My uncle caught COVID likely from not wearing a mask in that ER lobby. For a few weeks, he was like, ‚Äúwow, that sucked.‚Äù Now, he‚Äôs back to believing it was a hoax and he thinks the vaccine is a microchip.\n\nMy grandma thankfully made a full recovery and has since been vaccinated! I get my second dose in a few weeks and then I‚Äôll be able to see her in person. I can‚Äôt wait.",

Normally patients that are oriented can sign themselves out, even if they are actively having a heart attack etc.  However, the concern was letting someone leave who knowingly has a communicable disease who is not going to isolate, wear a mask, etc and expose the public to it.  They said it would be illegal to hold him and we had to let them go.  \n\nWith all the mistakes that were made (and many of them made multiple times, such as re-opening things and relaxing mask use) I have full confidence that with the next pandemic the officials and a percentage of the public will do everything wrong again.\n\nEdit: I will add that far more patients had what I termed ‚ÄúCovid regret‚Äù.  That is, they admitted they didn‚Äôt believe the news, the doctors, etc and were careless and now regretted it.  One caught it at a party their family had.

Government is trying to make you scared\" Yet 2 months later when the ICU filled up cause the surge came late, the excuse then became, \"I don't see any bodies so it can't be bad.\"\n\nShits absolutely fucked.

They believed it was all a hoax and that even in the unlikely event that there was something going around, it was just being played up and blown out for corporate gains/the libs and pharmacy companies were just trying to get money and control, but god would protect them in the end so they still attended church and when the church had to shut down due to state mandates they all went to their preacher's house and worshiped there. Both her parents, her 6 siblings that lived with them, her other 8 siblings that had visited for Thanksgiving, their spouses, 5 of her nieces and nephews, and herself all got covid because someone who was positive attended a church service with them and most of the congregation caught covid as well. Her family didn't believe it was a thing and when 2 of the nephews weren't feeling well no one thought anything of it. She went to work, kept having to be reminded to keep her mask on even when the store was closed, she spent the majority of the day with myself and the store manager on a project in very close quarters, then her mom and a few siblings had to be rushed from work to the ER due to them not being able to breathe. We all found out a few days later that she and everyone I had listed from her family had gotten tested and tested positive and she had come to work anyway because she felt fine and believed that it was all a hoax. When she eventually came back to work about a month later she was still suffering from long term effects and explained that at first they had all fought being quarantined and thought they weren't allowed to visit the hospitalized family members due to the hospital putting on a show to keep up the covid lie. Then her dad and in total 14 other family members had to be put in the ICU and have tubes put in because they were so bad. The ones who weren't in the hospital either had no symptoms at all to mild symptoms; she ended up having mild symptoms. Her dad apparently kept fighting and screaming that he didn't have covid and it was just some mutated flu so the hospitals could get money, the government could instate martial law, and that he was a child of god who was protected, then he ended up going brain dead due to lack of oxygen and eventually the family decided to pull him off of life support. But when it was all said and done, my coworker lost 8 family members, was asked to resign for knowingly coming to work with covid and not telling anyone, and has had difficulty finding work because the health effects afterwards have her needing to sit down every 20 or so steps. As for my boss and I, my boss tested positive the same day as her daughter who got it from work, so it went through their family and she lost her brother who was housing her daughter and granddaughter right before the positive test, and I and my husband ended up testing negative but ironically/extremely luckily ended up with just a regular flu a few days after I was exposed.",

I‚Äôm a Family Physician working at an ED, we still receive COVID patients, but now we refer all of them to the other hospital in my city which has a temporary COVID unit. \n\nA 73 YO female comes in, and it was my turn at the COVID ward, so the paramedics tell me the patient is O2 dependent (15L/min) and I tell them to get her to the room she‚Äôs gonna be in, my beautiful staff (ER nurses) were already dressed up and waiting for her and I was going to make a few questions to her son in order to make my notes and proceed with the medical part. As soon as I start interrogating her son, the first thing he tells me is that she doesn‚Äôt have COVID. He took her to another hospital the day before and had her tested with an antigen swab test which came back negative, and she also had her first Pfizer dose (somehow she got the first dose), but then I don‚Äôt know why the same son took her to another hospital and had her tested again on the same day, she also had a CT scan and some blood work done. \n\nLater that day apparently she kept worsening and that‚Äôs why they took her to my hospital, but not until the next day (yesterday). But he kept saying that she had some respiratory disease but COVID, his argument was that whenever we see a patient with respiratory distress we just assume is COVID and we don‚Äôt go further, which he also said is unethical and unprofessional. Finally he showed me the results and there was a CORADS 4 and positive IgM antibodies, but negative antigen swab test, which he said he just did some research and might be because she just had her first dose. So I told him that I needed to get dressed up to get in with his mom and I needed all of the results they had, and that I was gonna leave him in order to make a full check-up on his mom in order to proceed with her attention, but he kept saying that he wouldn‚Äôt allow me to transfer his mom to the other hospital. \n\nThe 73 YO was in pretty bad shape, she already had kidney failure and needed dialysis ASAP. I really don‚Äôt know how she made it to yesterday, because she was in no shape to answer none of my questions and he never really told me how long she had been feeling sick. She might even die, just because he didn‚Äôt want to accept his mom might have COVID.",
