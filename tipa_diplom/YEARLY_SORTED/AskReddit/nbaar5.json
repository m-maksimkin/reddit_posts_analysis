She's staring at the groom, and she looks like she's about to cry. Anyways, as the groom is saying his vows, he calls the bride to be by the name of his ex, who turns out is the woman who just walked in!! Needless to say, the whole wedding went downhill from there, and the bride locked herself in the bathroom and eventually sneaked out of the reception. Last I heard they got divorced after trying to force the groom to relocate to London to make their marriage work, and he got back with his ex!\n\nI really hope Ross and Rachel are doing okay.",

I was soo wasted that I had lost my room keys, I told the lady at the desk I needed new keys, and she said I was too drunk and that I needed to leave after I had just paid like $1500 for a huge suite hours earlier, that completely set me off, as I just wanted to go to sleep and sober up at that point, but she said if I didn‚Äôt leave, that she was going to call the police, I told her that if she did, that I was going to piss on her desk, after I argued with her for a few more minutes, she said she was calling the police, and went to the back to use the phone, so as a man of my word, in the awe of the people at the wedding who could see me, I started pissing all over her desk, computer, paperwork, everything, mind you the Scranton police station is about three blocks away, if that, so the police were there in a minute, by the time I had pulled my pants up and got finished cursing her out, the cops came in through the front door, I then ran into the middle of the wedding, dipping and ducking behind people yelling don‚Äôt shoot at the top of my lungs, and everyone started panicking and running in every which direction which really pissed the officers off, they ended up finally catching up to me, and slamming my face onto the floor, even after I had laid on the floor surrendering, and bruised my face really bad. They charged me with Public Intoxication, which was later dismissed, because I told them I would sue them for police brutality if they pressed charges, which I still did anyway, and won, but after that, I received a Civil Suit from the people who‚Äôs wedding it was, for the cost of their wedding night because I completely ruined it in their words, and from the Raddison for all the money that they had reimbursed the couple already for what happened, the police department ended up paying for it, because I was brutally assaulted by them, and only ran because the cop had drawn his weapon, no reason to shoot me over a citation Lol üòÇ Wasn‚Äôt funny then, but it is now, if you‚Äôre reading this and that was your wedding, I am sorry but I feared for my life, and I knew the cop wouldn‚Äôt shoot into the wedding with all of those witnesses and cameras rolling, my apologies. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§≠",

I guess the downvotes are justifed. \n\nSo I used to work at a really rough hotel bar in Rotherham, UK (For those who don't know, rotherham is rough as fuck as it is).  We used to do a fair few weddings and they were really cheap, even our 'deluxe' package so it attracted a certain type of person.\n\nThe first example is sort of more sad than anything. The groom seemed like quite a nice chap, his bride seemed to be a bit on the rough side. I noticed that the room wasn't really filling up prior to the ceremony itself then realised it was only one side that wasn't filling up. Turns out the grooms family didnt approve of the bride and barely any of them turned up. A few friends maybe. But neither of his parents, grandparents or other family members. In the evening at his speech he thanked those who 'bothered to turn up' which was sad. The day itself was alright and it turned out to be a decent wedding by our rock-bottom standards. I cant imagine how shit it'd be your own parents not turning up. \n\nSecond one is more juicy. The bride and groom were both older people on their 2nd or 3rd marriage each and thus both had adult kids. Everything was going well at the bar, everyone seemed really happy and I was getting loads of tips (I had to refuse a guy who tried to tip me ¬£60 cos he was so drunk). \nAnyway I was serving the grooms son when the brides daughter came over too. I've no idea what the hell happened but all of a sudden she said she wanted to fight him. Fuck knows. Anyway in a gentlemanly fashion he said yes, and filled her in on the street outside. I dont know what she was expecting, she was tiny and he wasnt so it was fairly quick. \n\nAbout an hour later she's got some of her male friends to come along and crash her own mothers big day because of the guy beating her up. So they all burst in looking for him, then the bride (her mum remember) confronts her friends and asks what they're doing here. They explain that her daughter had been beaten up. What does the bride do? She obviously grabs a bottle and glasses one of her daughters mates. Standard night in Rotherham. They all left after this and police showed up later but I didnt get to speak to them and, as far as I'm aware, nothing came of it. \n\nCheers for the not-so-patience. I hope you didn't all overhype my initial post and found this atleast a tad entertaining.\n\n\nTldr; guys family didnt show up to his own wedding. Brides daughter offers grooms son a fight, son beats her up. Brides daughter calls friends to beat him up. Bride glasses her own daughters friend.",

Anyway, the wedding started off really well, everyone was drinking and dancing and having a good time. The ex-fianc√© even gave a toast to the bride and groom, wishing them well and it was really sweet. \n\nShortly after, a bunch of the ushers stood up and locked the doors to the reception hall and the band started playing this really creepy song. The bride‚Äôs father started giving his toast and you could just tell from his vibes that something was off. Then suddenly out of nowhere, one of the bride‚Äôs cousins (or sibling, idk she had a huge family) came up behind the ex-fianc√©‚Äôs PREGNANT wife and just started stabbing her in the stomach. Everyone freaked out and then the bride‚Äôs whole family just ATTACKED. They killed the ex-fianc√© by shooting him with arrows as he mourned his dead wife and unborn child, like it was literally SO BRUTAL. And they basically killed everybody in that whole reception hall. \n\nThe ex-fianc√©‚Äôs mom was there too and she was just pleading with the father of the bride, like ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt kill him, he‚Äôs my first-born son‚Äù and was sobbing, it was gut-wrenching. She even tried to take one of the bride‚Äôs cousins hostage to save her son‚Äôs life, but it didn‚Äôt work, they killed him anyway and then they literally SLIT HER THROAT while she was in shock staring at her son‚Äôs corpse. Then they killed his dog, beheaded them both and sewed the dog‚Äôs head on the ex-fianc√©‚Äôs body and like partied with it. It was seriously fucked up. The bride‚Äôs family did take the groom hostage for a couple of years until they could use him to end the siege of Riverrun and capture the Riverlands for the Lannisters, and ultimately the ex-fianc√©‚Äôs sister got revenge on the bride‚Äôs father and forced him to eat his own sons before slitting HIS throat, but last I heard the couple themselves were doing pretty well now and are off living peacefully with children of their own.",

I‚Äôm not a gin person, so I didn‚Äôt touch it. Here‚Äôs where the real problems start.\n\nOnce they opened the dance floor, the open bar also opened. In the next hour, I drank 5 margaritas. Yeah, I don‚Äôt have self control when it comes to my favorite vices. Still, had kinda felt frat house party vibes, the DJ was flirting with me, and I wanted to let loose. I was dancing with one of NBC‚Äôs reporters when I felt my stomach churn, and excused myself. Once I got (hopefully) out of everyone‚Äôs view, I bolted to the bathroom, only to miss the toilet and practically paint one of the walls with pizza and cheesecake, proceeded to slip, and soak half my dress in my mess. Then, slipped out of the wedding, and unfortunately, drove myself home.\n\nI‚Äôd never embarrassed myself so much in my life.

They went on on and about how this will be a super spreader event and how they couldn't believe they where the only ones with masks on, they where doing all this in a very rude and disrespectful way. For some context this was in a small town in Texas and the whole groom's family lives in the same town together and spends time at each others homes weekly, so if one of them had covid all of them already would of anyways. Some people had canceled because they didn't feel safe traveling and that was fine, everyone was very accepting of that. I finally told them that this was my sister's wedding and not theirs, I said they are perfectly welcome to leave if they do not feel safe but they needed to knock it off. They listened for the most part and it was a great wedding, I definitely got myself taken out of some wills that day though.",

He was with his fiance who was bewildered wondering why I was picking a fight. He walked away with a smirk, by this time people, including my girlfriend was holding me back from hitting him, and in my fit of anger, I pushed everyone away and threw a bottle at him as he was walking away which bounced into the reception hall. And by then, everyone was looking at the commotion and scene i caused. \n\nI managed to catch up with him but he was already in the wedding hall, I merely shouted at him and telling his fiance to take a close look at that sleazebag. He was just ignoring me. Of course music stopped and everyone got quite scared as I looked like a man possessed. \n\nI walked away and some of the relatives of the bride/groom talked to me and told me not to do that to someone's reception and sympathised with me when they heard my side of the story and advised me to calm down.

The guys, including the groom had beers in town and then headed up and arrived about 30 minutes before the ceremony was scheduled to begin.  other family and friends started filtering in and the scheduled time came and went with no bride or bridal party...we asked my friend if everything was ok and he said he had spent the last few nights on the couch as he and his bride to be were fighting \"quite a bit\"  about 15 minutes after the ceremony was scheduled to start the bridal party arrived looking quite disheveled and upset.  Turns out, the limo driver who was driving the bridal party drove right past the amphitheater and then had to turn around and drive down.  the brakes on the limo failed on the way down and he had to slam the limo into a guardrail to stop the car.  the bridal party had to walk the half mile down hill to the amphitheater.  Because its a popular wedding venue and another wedding was scheduled to go on in 10 minutes, the wedding ceremony had to be rushed and then we had to GTFO to let the next one start.  marriage lasted 6 months.  \n\nside note: at the reception, there were cameras on each table for guests to take pictures of themselves enjoying the festivities.  needless to say, our table's camera spent the reception in the bathroom taking lots of dick pics...bride was not amused",

I was in charge of two things for the wedding plan ordeal: the music and the food. Ex‚Äôs family was loaded so I got to go big for the food. I went to several catering company tastings before deciding. The company I went with seemed legit. The food was good, I was a chef for a long time, so I was very picky. Our guest list was medium-ish, but I spent close to 10 grand on the food and music. Now, on to the story.\n\nAfter the ceremony there were the obligatory pictures, grab a drink at a bar before going to the reception where you expect to begin the meal. We were out for a cocktail for maybe an hour, and the venue was very close by. That was all fine and good, I didnt think any shenanigans that may be happening. We get to the venue, more pictures and stuff, then we get to the building and went to sit down at the head table, or whatever its called, and get ready to eat. The food was gone. There was no food left. The catering director served the food immediately after the guests arrived. It was buffet style, and it was all gone. So, my wedding party that is half in the bag and stoned at this point (wedding party was all stoners) and really needed to get some food in them.\n\nThe caterer had a little makeshift kitchen at the outdoor venue and it was surrounded with basic cubicle type walls. It was actually a pretty impressive setup. I stormed into the kitchen and went straight to the director and got right in their face. I sternly asked several questions, as to why there is no fucking food left. Director says they thought we wanted the food ready for the guests. I kinda blacked out from rage for a couple of seconds. They didnt have time to go back to base and bring some more food so they just put out a bunch of dive bar food for people to snack on. I was pretty adamant at this point that the bride better get an actual meal. They scrapped something together with the few scraps of food that was left, it was like a tiny cucumber tea party sandwich. \n\nWe ordered pizza",

            "text": "The bride was a friend, who I shouldn't have been friends with. This was **many** years ago. \n\nShe was someone I had crushed on hard for more than I should have. But I was her friend, who she would call up and talk to anytime she had guy troubles. When I was still crushing on her, she would always say how she wished she could find a guy like me. The classic \"I wish there were more guys like you, but not you\" type of mindset. So you can believe how hard it was to be her friend. Looking back now, we wouldn't have been friends. -- My only excuse is I wasn't as mature and still foolishly thought, \"someday.\" It didn't help that she would sometimes give me hope, too (long story).\n\nI was invited to her wedding. I really did not want to go. If you ever had feelings for someone, you know watching them marry someone else is not on your bucket list. But I did not want to be an asshole and not show my 'friend' support on her special day. She had made a big deal about how important it was for me to be there too.  She even included me as part of the wedding party as the coordinator and requested I work with her wedding planner too.\n\nSo there I was with the bride, some of her bridesmaids, and the wedding staff, setting up the last-minute details hours before the wedding. She was to be married that evening. Paying close attention to detail, as her wedding planner seemed more involved with her next wedding, and not the current one, everyone was starting to look between the bride for details and me. The groom had been \"OK\" with how she wanted to do things, so he had never once offered up an opinion on the wedding (as far as I knew). The bride had complimented how fun it was to work with me and how it was so nice to have someone who understood her (including her needs and wants).\n\nI was so involved in what I was doing that before I knew it, everyone else had left, and it was just the bride and me alone.\n\nI recall turning around to ask her something, but before I could get a word out, she had kissed me. More than that, she was now in my lap and basically tossing herself at me. Telling me everything I had always wanted to hear, including, 'I love you.' She went on about how I was the only man who ever listened, whoever truly cared for her as she wanted to be cared for.  She had tried to undress me more than a few times, but I kept telling her how she was due to be married. She told me she wanted to call the wedding off and be with me instead. Still kissing me while undressing herself. I told her if she meant what she said, she needed to break it off with the groom first. I also told her she needed to think about this.  -- I was my \"nice guy\" self (the real kind. Yes, we do exist.).\n\nI wanted her. I had always wanted her. And here she was tossing herself at me, trying to seduce me, and telling me how sorry she was she had waited this long to realize I was the right man all along. She even told me how she imagined if this was our wedding and how wonderful it has been that we had planned this wedding together.  Nearly stopping short of asking me to marry her. Suggesting the wedding continue as planned, only I should be the groom, but conceding how awkward that would be with the groom's family there.\n\nI convinced her we could not sleep together, here and now. And that if she really felt this way, she needed to break things off with the groom. She continued to try to take me, then and there, a few times, and I would be lying if I said I didn't want it. I did. Her standing there only in her thong, she was more beautiful than I had imagined, and the smell and taste of her intoxicating. Add in all the words she was saying, and my heart was melting. But I digress. She finally put on her clothes, told me she loved me, said she would break it off with the groom, and for me to wait there.\n\nI did as she instructed and waited. A few of the guests started showing up, and the full wedding staff was there. But I was still waiting. What was I to do? Tell people I \"knew\" she was breaking it up with the groom? It wasn't my place to say anything. Soon after, the groom was there, and oh, look at the time. The wedding should have started five minutes ago.  I had assumed that she had not broken it off (officially) and was going to leave him standing there when I suddenly hear the music, \"here comes the bride.\"  And what do I see? Her and ready to walk down to see her soon-to-be husband. She had decided to go through with it without telling me.\n\nI could not stay there and watch. So I made my way to the exit, and what I had not realized was she had seen me make the way to the exit and called out to me mid-aisle. Her groom looked mad as hell. Ran up to me, and we fought (well, technically, I was only defending myself). When they finally broke us apart, there was only one question for the bride. \"Why did you call out to Linux-Is-Best?\"\n\nShe claimed that she felt emotional and confused seeing her \"best\" friend leave her wedding. That's when she asked me, why was I leaving? Realizing that she had no intentions to break it off with him and realizing I had once more been given false hope, and with everyone looking at me as if I was the 'fuck up.' I made the excuse that I was closing the door. I was not going to make an ass of myself and profess my feelings, she already knew them, and if she was not going to come clean on what had happened only a little while before, I was not going to make an even bigger scene.   \n\nOddly, everyone accepted our answers. Even the groom who had apologized, admitting that he had secretly felt threatened by me (and the closeness the bride has shown toward me). He continued about how naturally he assumed something was up when she called out and admitted he knew how emotional she could be (going on about that was why he loved her).\n\nSince some of the guests had left and part of the place was now trashed. It was decided the wedding would be rescheduled. But I did not lie. I had closed a door-- on our friendship.",

Families were great friends. Well, as we both got older, we realized the attraction to each other. We dated for about 2 years. Her mom divorced her dad and won full custody over her so they moved. This was the end of our relationship. I was crushed over it, but life moves on. \n\nShe engaged a man from her new hometown and invited me to her wedding. I debated going because I didn't know if I could watch someone I loved get married to someone else, and I felt it would make her fianc√© uncomfortable. I even told her this, and she insisted it was all okay and convinced me to come. \n\nThe wedding seemed picture perfect. Both families were having a great time. It was not a traditional wedding, more so party all day, get married, party more. But they didn't get married...\n\nWhen it came time for vows, I noticed the groom acting strange. He was glancing around and sweating profusely. It wasn't that hot, and I get nerves can really affect that, but something about it wasn't natural. He paused in the middle of the vow for a brief moment before locking eyes with me and yelling \"Why the f* is he here\". This startled everyone, and myself because now everyone was looking at me. \n\nMy ex began panicking, (she doesn't like confrontation or stressful situations) and she began pleading with him to just apologize and move on. I offered to leave, as it was obvious I was causing an issue, to which her family demanded that I was not to leave. This enraged the groom and his parents. The groom's father grabbed me by the collar and began pulling me away. \n\nI told him \"Let me go, I'm leaving\". He did not. This sparked a huge fight between people in my ex's family trying to help me. My ex was in tears and stormed off the stage. The groom finally worked his way through the crowd to me and punched me in the nose. So I had blood all over my grandpa's suit, which was maintained and handed down to me from my father. This p* me off so I punched him in his nose. \n\nPolice showed up, placed me and the groom in handcuffs to question us. Several witnesses declared my actions as self defense. I did not press assault charges as I had already ruined the wedding. Surprisingly enough, the police didn't take him or I into custody, I think because neither of us had anything to drink, or maybe they saw the disaster that had unfolded and decided not to make matters worse. To this day I still don't know. \n\nI left, the bloodied groom stormed off with his dad and called off the wedding. He accused my ex of cheating on him with me, despite having no proof. She was heartbroken. I knew I shouldn't have gone to the wedding, but I may have saved her from a bad marriage? She has now been married to a guy for about 4 years and going strongly. \n\nAfter the wedding I called her and apologized, she said she forgives me, but didn't want to talk to me ever again. \n\nUnderstandable. \n\ntl;dr\nI ruined my ex's wedding she invited me to by starting a fight unintentionally.",

The this is very much business related, and not fraud, or anything illegal (I can't talk about the [this], just know it's not that important other than as a catalyst.) \n\nLeaving the rehearsal dinner, I am livid. This is a destination wedding with more than a 5 hour drive. I leave peacefully, and the whole walk back to my hotel I am thinking, \"Fuck these people\", and was ready to drive two hours to a friends place near by. I had already planned to visit this friend after the wedding since I was close, so arriving early wasn't going to be too much trouble. \n\nWell I think on the walk and decide it's probably better I stay. I didn't pay for the room, and there was no way I could justify driving drunk like that for 2 hours in a place that I wasn't really comfortable with. Those would've been terrible decisions. \n\nSo I wake up, and my brother immediately asks what I did and why the mother of the groom asked him to talk to me, and of course I explained that I didn't really know, I just said the wrong thing to the wrong person. I told him exactly how everything went and what was said, and he basically just told me to be cautious and not upset anyone; \"ok\". \n\nThis is the day of the wedding. We had planned to visit a local attraction, and I had to explain to my mother what was going on while we were there. She now feels bad for me, and say's \"ok, just watch what you say\"; \"ok\"... \n\nWell the day goes on and everyone is having a great time (including me), and I'm thinking about getting kicked out of the rehearsal dinner all day, of course.  It's time for the wedding. I want to stress that at this point, I was pretty confused. All I know is that I upset Tori, the groom was upset about me upsetting her. Whatever, I get dressed, grab a beer, and keep moving. \n\nWe get picked up from our hotel on this cute little tram, and what do ya know, Tori and her fianc√© are sitting right behind me. Now at this point, I am determined to have a good time and not let this bother me, so I am all smiles and just generally having a good time. \"Kill them with your happiness\". Just a little moment where there is this tension (in hindsight, I don't think she remembered the previous night but knew something had happened because obviously I got kicked out of the rehearsal dinner). \n\n... and so the wedding continues. Very, very cute wedding, the Bride did such a fantastic job. Great little ceremony in a chapel, followed by a moving cocktail hour through carnival rides and popcorn stands and on to the reception. \n\nHere's where things start to finally make sense. While drinking at the reception, Tori comes up to me, and we start talking. It was a really friendly convo and I jested that she got me kicked out of the rehearsal dinner. She immediately goes \"what?\", and is surprised. I'm like \"yeah, you said something to groom and he got really upset and kicked me out of the rehearsal dinner\". I remember this part like it was yesterday; she says \"he did not?!\" and then after apologizing a bit, immediately goes off to find him. \n\n[\"Oh, shit\"](https://digginginthedirt.de/photos/upload/2018/05/26/20180526174235-2d21de5d.gif). -me \n\nSo now here I am... thinking that once again I have said the wrong thing to the wrong person. She's now ran off trying to find the groom to give him shit for giving me shit. Great! What have I gotten myself into?? Will I really have to leave the wedding too? \n\nWell nothing comes of that, thank god, and the night continues. Tori continues to get wasted. Eventually we get to the end of the night and I am lingering helping people. Everyone is making their way onto a tram so we can find a bar for the afterparty. The after party is always exciting, and I'm looking forward to this! \n\nWe're all on the tram now, or are we?? Quickly looking around, I noticed the bride but the groom is nowhere to be found. Tori's fianc√© is on the tram, but Tori is nowhere either. Security comes up to the tram and we're asking them, \"hey have you seen the groom\". As luck would have it, security is coming to tell us where he is. They explain that he's over by one of the small cottages on the property, taking care of another guest who is sick. \n\nI think the color goes out of my face as I think to myself, \"OMG, he's with Tori, I know exactly what's going on, this is all my fault\". No one else knew as the security only knew the groom, not the guest. I've never been one to not try to fix something after I've broken it, and since I've caused this drama, I decide that I need to go help. At the very least, the groom needed to get on the tram. \n\n\"Show me\" I say to security, and I tell everyone else to hang tight, as I'll be right back with the groom. \n\nWell I get to the steps of this cottage, and as I thought, there is the groom and Tori. She's really drunk and has been getting sick. Funny moment, Tori see's me and goes \"just what I need right now\". Once again, this is my fault, So I say to the groom, \"look, I know you may not want to see me right now, but this is your wedding day, and the bride is sitting on the tram without you. I don't care if you come back with me or not, but you need to call someone and tell them exactly what you are doing.\" He agrees and say's \"ok\", and I start walking back to the tram.  \n\nI get back to the Tram, and Tori's fianc√© looks at me, we lock eyes, have a moment of \"it's Tori?\" and he literally runs off to take care of her (so sweet, he looked really concerned). \n\nAfter a few moments, the groom appears and gets on the Tram! SUCCESS! I think. We are all off to the after party, and tensions are light. Another one of my family members is going to wait with Tori and her fianc√© to get them back. Everyone is celebratory and headed back to town; let's drink! \n\nSo we get to town, and the bar was meh, so it's decided just to go back to the hotel. Well wait a second, we get back and the groom is nowhere to be found, again. I'm sitting with the bridesmaids and the bride, and I say to the bride \"I'm so sorry, this was all my fault\", and I'm enthusiastically apologizing for ruining her wedding. She doesn't seem that upset with me and just wants the groom to come back. She say's things like \"he doesn't want to be with me on our wedding night\" (that's a paraphrase, I don't remember the exact wording). Basically she's very upset and feels like he just keeps disappearing. \n\nHe wasn't far, the groom was wondering around town, and after a conversation with another brother of mine on the bench out front, the groom comes in, apologizes to the bride, and they head up to bed. Me and my brother are happy, \"who wants to keep drinking!?\" \n\nSo once again, I have ruined this wedding. The groom and bride are in a tift, presumably over something I said to a coworker, and even though the bride tells me \"look, it's really not your fault, don't worry about it\", I just feel awful.  \n\nMy brother and I start walking, knocking on doors, seeing who's still up. It's past two now, and we were the last one's awake, and so we start talking. Since he was the one who talked to the groom out on the front bench, I asked him what was up, and he tells me: \n\nGroom basically said to him on the bench \"Never invite the girl you're in love with to your wedding\". \n\nIf a million little light bulbs just went off in your head, you know exactly how I felt. I start telling him the story I just told you guys and we start to compare notes, and let me just tell you I had such a moment of \"thank god this wasn't me\". \n\nNow Tori and the groom did indeed go through something very difficult at work together. I don't know exactly when their relationship started but it grew stronger through the work difficulties. So when I brought this up at their wedding, it wasn't the work situation that the groom was upset over, but indeed it was his love of the person I upset. \n\nTori and the Groom are now happily married and have a child together. Get togethers are a little awkward, but it's whatever. His mom was really upset for a while; it was not an inexpensive wedding, and a lot of people travelled. The bride kept my wedding gift; she's a good person, I don't mind too much, but c'mon people, rules are rules! In the future if you divorce before 6 months, you have to send the gifts back!  \n\nTL;DR: Groom invited a co-worker to the wedding. I upset the co-worker, and the groom, get kicked out of rehearsal dinner and have ruined the wedding. Turns out that the Groom was in love with the co-worker, and not the bride. Opps.",

If you know  anything about Solstice, you‚Äôll know that it draws hundreds of thousands of people to a tiny corner of the city. Another fun fact about the Solstice festival is that it is kicked off by a parade. Something important to know about this parade is that it is lead by a huge group of naked cyclists. Like, people are body-painted in all different designs and ride their bikes naked through the parade route before it officially starts. \n\nSo the naked bike parade concludes in the big park called Gas Works Park, which happens to have a lovely view of the downtown Seattle skyline, with the Space Needle and all. It‚Äôs a very popular place for taking photos, so someone in the wedding party of the photographer had the brilliant idea to take the wedding party photos there, which would have been fine any other weekend. They failed to check the calendar or do some basic research. \n\nNow, there‚Äôs hundreds of totally naked, painted people hanging out in this park. The sun‚Äôs out, this is the biggest weekend celebration of the year. People are high, drunk, just having fun and hanging out naked in the park... When this wedding party comes walking through the park to take their photos. They stuck around for maybe half an hour, but all their wedding photos kept getting photo-bombed by rando nudes. When they left, they were PISSED. Like, stomping off, so mad, and they couldn‚Äôt get out of the park fast enough. It was comical how fast they got out of there, practically running through a park full of naked folks.\n\nI felt a little bad for them, but if they knew anything about the city, they should have done maybe 5 minutes of research if they wanted to avoid a crowd that weekend. \n\nHere‚Äôs a link to a page with photos of the bike parade, to give an idea of what I‚Äôm talking about.

The business was struggling and we had this renaissance themed wedding on a Friday night.  We had ordered giant turkey legs and renaissance fair style food.  All special ordered for this event.  \n\nThe night before the wedding, the landlord and his friends were drunk and pissed because my father was late on the rent for the building.  They ‚Äúbroke‚Äù in, stole and/or ate a lot of, if not most of the food, stole the catering truck keys, and had a whole new alarm put on the place.  I had been rushed over there after school by my mother who was hysterical.  This little skinny guy who worked for us named Jimbo was climbing up the rafters trying to cut the alarm system as my father with a bunch of random neighbors and whoever were scattering to get packed up for this wedding.  We were already hours late setting up for.  Jimbo had to Hotwire the truck and we were on our way.\n\nWe got there and were angrily greeted by 100 or so guests who were fully dressed and armed as if they were heading out to the Battle of Helm‚Äôs Deep.  They are all pissed....PISSED.  Not like fun English pissed where they‚Äôre drink and merry...fucking mad.\n\nSo we‚Äôre dripping cold or frozen giant turkey legs into totally room temperature oil and putting it on their plates.  Cracking Miller Light cans into what was supposed to be horns full of mead.  If I wasn‚Äôt clear, everyone at this wedding had a weapon.  Crossbows, swords, daggers, ball and chains.  It was legit, top level cosplay actors with the real shit.  \n\nSo by the end of it, there was this room that had dozens of candelabras going with lit candles.  Not sure what the room was for but it might have been a picture staging area or cocktail hour spot.  I see my dad is in there talking to a woman, apologizing and it‚Äôs dark except for the candles.  This woman is dressed like that witch in Kevin‚Äôs Costner‚Äôs Robin Hood.  The discussion turned heated when I came in and she started slapping the lit candles at my father, one by one down the line.  All while screaming like a banshee.  \n\nWe ran to the 1980s Diesel Post Office van that we were using for a delivery truck and had to hotshot it again to get going.

Sometimes big things like a partial tent collapse.  It's the staff's job to make sure the guests never find out.  Sometimes its easier while sometimes it's impossible.  But we do what we can.\n\nI've had guests go missing.  They wonder off into the woods for a smoke break or to just get away with someone they just met to never be seen again... until they get found hours later after the event is over.  Often times its the new couple going off to have some alone time and not realizing that their allotted 15 minutes is now causing toasts to be pushed back an hour.\n\nI've had not enough food for the guests due to a variety of reasons such as accidents in transit.  Finding out that the clients ordered protein meals (meat) and half their guests are vegetarians.  Hundreds of extra people attending an event.  Ferrel animals getting to unattended food.  People complaining that what we have to offer they can't eat \"Miss, we're in a barn in the woods... we brought what we brought.\"\n\nI've had events where the client thought a good time to bring up an issue with a bill would be at the event.  If you order food for 200 people and find out at your wedding that half of your guests are fasting so you ordered way too much food we can't cut your bill in half.\n\nI've seen fights of all kinds.  Mostly between guests but I've seen staff (not mine) involved in them before.  We always feed the security at every wedding and I hate when I sit down for my own dinner and talk with them and hear that other caterers often times don't feed them.\n\nToo many drunk people to count that get way to flirty with staff.  I'm protective of my staff.  Especially since a lot of them are younger and inexperienced with how to deal with drunk peoples.  But if you're at a wedding don't hit on the staff.  There are plenty of people at a weddings to hook up with.\n\nFires starting in bathrooms from people throwing away still lit cigarettes/cigars.\n\nLost rings.  Photographer took the rings into the woods to get a scenic shot of them on a pillow.  It fell off when she wasn't looking.  The entire wedding party spent an hour looking for it.  They came back the next day with metal detectors.  As far as I know it wasn't found.\n\nDrugs of all kind.  Cops being called for different reasons.  Drunk staff (again, not mine!).  Medical emergencies of different kinds.\n\n99% of the time catering is a great job.  It's like working in a restaurant but instead of getting assholes at your tables, you get people who are there to have fun and in the best moods they'll ever be in.\n\nAnd it *always* gets asked.  *\"Have you ever seen someone object to a wedding?\"*  And the answer is that really only happens in the movies.  First off people don't really put that in their ceremony anymore because it's a bit outdated.  Second people object by not showing up.  I've had weddings where people didn't come because they didn't like the marriage.  But objecting at the ceremony just doesn't happen.  All of the other caterers that I have professional relationships with have never seen this either.",

It was almost the height of the pandemic and we were worried what would happen if he got sick, so we acted quickly to get him officially on my insurance.

Groom didn‚Äôt show. \n\nBride is nowhere to be found. Felicia is upstairs crying with her bridesmaids (my cousins). The caterers are informed the Wedding is off so they take us to the reception area. The bride enters to Survivor by Destiny‚Äôs Child. & is flooded with love and support. At this point I‚Äôm faded. She paid for an open bar so I woke up at my cousins house by a lady in a wedding dress banging on the bathroom door. I didn‚Äôt dream it all. \nOver the next week the story starts to circulate.\nMy boys called the groom on the day of the wedding to chastise him for not showing up. The groom (Jason) is confused as to why strangers are calling him about him not showing up to some wedding. Jason says he‚Äôs tired of prank calls, his break is done, he‚Äôs going back to work. They get tired of him playing dumb so the go to his job. \nJason recognizes them as his gf friends and talks to them explaining if he had known he was getting married he obviously wouldn‚Äôt have gone to work. \nFelicia says she told him the wrong date !?!\n\nBut no!?!? He actually never knew. Every time they were together she would warn people not to mention the wedding because Jason was upset that his late mother wasn‚Äôt able to attend so the wedding is a touchy subject. Felicia- who has all of Jason‚Äôs info would take out credit cards under his name, max then out. & when Jason gets a call informing him of transactions he‚Äôs despite them cause why would he be spending money on a wedding if he‚Äôs not getting married. \n\nSo the whole time Felicia knew this was a scam but she asked my cousin, her best friend for money & she emptied her tuition fund to pay for a wedding Felicia knew was fake. \n\nPs. Jason‚Äôs mother is alive & well.\nThe only people at the wedding was my family & a few church friends. Her family didn‚Äôt show (cause they knew better. His family-cause duhh.\nOhhhh & Jason & Felicia are still together.",

One of the bride's maids came up to me and whispered in my ear \"Do you want to do something crazy?\" So I said ok, and she led me to the bathroom that was built into the barn where all the horses were kept, not too far from where everyone else was at.  We started having sex, but unfortunately everyone could hear us, which got the attention of her dad.(She was like mid 30s btw, I was only 21)  Her dad came up to the bathroom door and proceeded to try and break it down, while threatening to hurt me in the process.  He was also screaming to his daughter that she has 4 kids out there she was setting a bad example for, which just got the attention of the otherwise obvious kids.  Because of how the bathroom was built, the bathroom floor was a foot higher than the bottom of the door, so it was nearly impossible to bust inward.  He eventually tired of breaking down the door and when they got him a safe distance away, we came out to nearly everyone at the wedding gathered around the barn bathroom door including her 4 crying children.  Her dad was still trying to attack me and had to be restrained by a couple of the guys there.  My cousin was quite pissed and him and his new wife actually came to my house the next day to have a talk with me.  They got divorced not even 6 months later.  Honestly never liked that cousin much anyway.",

One of those guests was a business rival of the Grooms - I‚Äôm talking generational rivalry, here - and while they were on friendly enough terms, they didn‚Äôt really like each other. \n\nFast forward to the reception, being held at a marina. The Bride and Groom plan on leaving for their honeymoon on their boat afterwards. The Guest mentioned above, knowing this, thought it would be funny to put a half dozen chickens borrowed from a farmer on the boat thinking about how the Groom would have no idea what to do about it. The night goes on, and after many libations, people filter home - and the Guest takes a cab home.\n\nThe Bride and Groom discover this chickens and realize who placed them there; both of them, down to clown and probably fairly drunk, begin to wrangle up the chickens, walk them out to the parking lot, and place them inside the Guest‚Äôs brand-new pickup truck that was less than a week old. \n\nThe next morning, the Guest returns to the marina hungover as sin at 4:00pm in the evening - on a scorching hot 30¬∞c summer day - only to find a half dozen (unfortunately) cooked chickens inside of his truck that spent the entire night shitting everywhere and pecking apart all of the leather upholstery. \n\nThe truck was ruined, and the Bride and Groom were happily enjoying their honeymoon at sea.",

Lots of swearing, alcohol, kids running around (unexpected in a relatively high end resort) etc.  it went from rowdy to wild as the day progressed and the members got progressively more drunk.

Apparently someone had stolen all (or at least most) of the gifts from the table inside their area. The bride is running around crying and screaming asking where her husband went. Turns out he had passed out on the concrete by the pool. \n\nHotel security reviewed the footage and it turns out (pretty obviously) that it was a few of their own wedding party that had stolen the gifts and put them in their car in the parking lot.

My SO just wanted to go to the court house and have a big honeymoon then save the remainder of the money for our new life together. Her father however insisted on walking her done the isle. \n\nThe day of the wedding I got a call from my mom saying that the venue was booked for the wrong day and, that their was an elderly trash pickup going on. While we were freaking out she called backed and said a city council woman was there and the venue was in her district. She moved some stuff around so we could pull of the wedding but we had to share the outside with a photo shoot later that evening. \n\nWe got to the venue and my dad told us that the BBQ was messed up so he had to order food. Then I saw who was helping my parents sent up. The one family friend I explicitly said to no invite because she is crazy. I went outside to clear my head. My Grandpa walked up to me and said he had a run in with the elderly group as they were leaving. They were pissed they had to leave and told him to \"Fuck off\" and \" Thanks for fucking up my morning\". \n\nI then got a call from a close friend who was coming saying that his roommate (who was not invited) ditched him and was coming to our wedding without him. He was only an hour plane ride away so I got him a ticket. I then had to call the friends she was staying with to make sure she didn't show up or she would be asked to leave. The reason I didn't want her to come is because me and my SO had a falling out with her a couple of months ago because she is batshit crazy.\n\nThe first guest to arrive was my very conservative grandmother who was toting around a large garbage bag. My father came up to me later and informed me that all 6 of her firearms were in the bag because she saw a sign saying \"take your valuables with you\" in the parking lot.\n\nDuring the ceremony  the minister slipped in religious jargon after we explicitly told him not to. We are not religious even in the slightest. We plan to renew our vowels at a later date to at least rectify this part.\n\nAfter the ceremony, that family friend I didn't want to invite approached us and asked us if we were swingers. This 40 year old blob of a hillbilly human had the gaul to pick us up on our wedding day. Right after she said that, her husband approached us and said \"Hey thanks for the dinner and the show. There's a girl with her pussy out in the garden.\" That's right folks! The photo shoot was a completely nude shoot. \n\nAt the end of it all I really can't believe all this shit happened in a couple of hours.\n\nTLDR: Wedding date was wrong, old people cussed out my grandpa, my grandma brought her guns, Jesus came to the party, my mom's friends were DTF, and their was a nude photo shoot.

Total accident my friend is 6'4 and a clumsy giant so he apologizes profusely but she is pissed. Doesn't make a scene right there but walks away and straight to her husband who looks over towards my friend after she points him out and this guy looks PISSED. I'm standing there next to him watching this unfold thinking that something bad is going to happen at this wedding and there's going to be a fight. By some miracle, the bride's brother walks by and we pull him over to us and ask him if we can extend our good wishes to the bride and groom. He walks us over to their table and we start talking to the bride, groom, and their families. We definitely got lucky and when we had the chance we got out of there so the wedding day wouldn't be ruined in case the guy tried to uphold his wife's honor. No idea which side of the family they were there for but I'd like to think they're still cursing our friend to this day.",

This bridesmaid insisted she make all 300 wedding invites by hand (because she was an avid scrap-booker). The bride agreed because she thought she‚Äôd save money. She didn‚Äôt. Everything this bridesmaid purchased was way over budget and difficult to source. She couldn‚Äôt make all the invites by hand on time as they were far too detailed. She guilt tripped all the bridesmaids into making the invites with her, which took days and shifts of volunteers. She was horribly rude. She tried to take over every event planned for the bride even though her sister and I outranked her in the bridal party and had it handled. She made myself and the other bridesmaids want fo quit several times. \nThe bride ( I love her but) was extremely unorganised, late to everything due to her total lack of time management, and insisted on handing out tons of jobs in the week leading up to the wedding that should have been done well in advance to that. It felt hard to breathe from the stress of it. Even her 200 person seating chart wasn‚Äôt done until 2am the night before the wedding. \nHer friend from the church told her she changed her mind about how much she would charge for the dresses she was making all of us. I think she tripled the cost. Very last minute in terms of wedding planning. So she gave that girl the boot. Then she was having our dresses made by the Groom‚Äôs aunt. None of them fit right and we were having last minute fittings up until the day before the wedding. The aunt turned up the morning of the wedding with the brides altered dress and it did not fit. The bride was crying. And it was not the finished look they had agreed on. It ended up being a pretty boring gown. And we were all trying to offer a solution while watching the start time of the wedding come and go on the clock. We were an hour late to her wedding. The guests were not amused. You could feel the tension. The service was one where the pastor‚Äôs goal was to convert any non-Christians, and waffled on and on. Boring Bible bashing. \nThe bride tried to save on photography by having her own aunt do the photos because she loved her aunt‚Äôs amateur wildlife photography. Turns out photographing people was much harder for than she cared to admit, and my friend still regrets her photos even 16 years later. She cried when she got them back. They were awful, and the aunt had forgotten to take pictures of key family members too. I gave my speech to the bride at the reception and had everyone in laughing when I finished by saying ‚ÄúLaura, I‚Äôm jealous that you will be having sex tonight and I won‚Äôt.‚Äù I knew the couple had waited until their wedding night to consummate, and that my audience would be conservative Christian so they would be extraordinarily shocked and love it. \nI could see my mother in the large crowd of tables stand up, and take off to the bathroom. My young sister informed me that mum was so embarrassed by me. I found mum in the loo and she said ‚ÄúI am so embarrassed to call you my daughter right now. I can‚Äôt believe you would say that in front of 200 guests. You know better.‚Äù I laughed it off. \nThe wedding reception ended early when a guest had a seizure on the dance floor and had to be taken away by ambulance. He was a known epileptic in the brides‚Äôs church, and he knew the consequences of being around flashing disco lights but he selfishly did it any way. The bride was so upset as dancing is one of her favourite things in the world, and what she and the groom were looking forward to most. \nWhen it came to my own wedding a few months later we had a bit of a drive to an old country church. I was on time because I learned a lot from her wedding. But suddenly the car carrying the bridesmaids pulled over and so we followed. When one of the bridesmaids came up to my car and told me she was told by my maid of honour (Laura) to stop the cars so we could be a little late, so all the guests had time to take a seat, I was more than annoyed. I had already factored that into my time. No way she was going to make me late to my wedding like she was to hers‚Ä¶.",

The most eventful wedding I've ever attended. \n\n\nMy aunty got too drunk, fell down some stairs and broke her ankle. And I mean really smashed her ankle, blood everywhere and screaming in pain. Spent the best part of a year with external pins and a halo. She wasn't wearing any shoes when this happened.\n\nOne of my brothers friends and his wife also got too drunk in charge of a two year old (family friendly reception). Not only did they leave him roaming an extremely large venue but they got fed up with him and locked him in the car in a car seat on his own for hours. I went outside to the car park to find my dad, saw the kid, rang the police. The couple screamed at me for ruining their night.\n\nMy dad _also_ got too drunk, as said previously I went out to find him, when the police removed the couple and child from the situation I continued to search for him. Found him fast asleep cuddling a bush, 10/10 the most hilarious thing I've seen. \n\nMy sister (~33 years old at the time) _also_ got too drunk, I remember dancing with her then she disappeared, went in her room in the cabin to wake her up the next morning to find 2 men either side of her (guests and both active British Army soldiers who were on leave for the wedding).\n\nAmazing.",

No vows speeches first dances etc. It was great for me because I'm anxious AF and it was easy for me to just sit on the stage and take pictures with everyone, and most of all I didn't have to say ANYTHING lol.\n\nBut before the wedding one of my cracked out cousins receives her invite and sees a blessing in Arabic on it. Proceeds to text me saying my husband will beat and abuse me because he's Muslim. Ok, I unvite her. Then she's mad I uninvite her. Her and her mother (my aunt) don't show up.\n\nWhile we were taking pictures pre reception we get a call from the imam saying we can't get married. I wrote agnostic on my wedding form instead of catholic. My FIL saw this, thought it was fine, gave it to the imam to keep for one week and only right before the wedding did he go over the form. So I basically had to convert on the spot to get married or call off the whole thing.\n\nI was soooo pissed. I told everyone I wasn't converting and to send the guests home. My husbands whole family started crying so I relented and did a psuedo conversion to get on with the wedding.\n\nI invited my narcissistic mother who I'd previously been no contact with. My family insisted I invite her. She shows up to this traditional Muslim wedding in a bight strapless blue dress like she's at the met gala. She gets mad that she's not involved in things during the wedding (ie, family walking in and being introduced, family being on the stage during marriage/signing, it was only my dad and brother). She really struggled with not having attention on her so she went around introducing herself to EVERYONE as the mother of the bride so they knew.\n\nFortunately all these things were low key and not obvious to anyone but me and close family.\n\nWe had a huge variety of people at the wedding, Bosnian Finnish Columbian polish Hungarian. They all got trashed in the parking lot because it was a dry wedding. Even though my husbands side is conservative they ended up loosening up and dancing with everyone else. Even though it seemed like they were polar opposites everyone got along really well.\n\nOther funny cultural things: I'm in the bridal suite with my husband, best friend, and brother. My MIL comes in and meets my brother for the first time. He extends his hand to says it's nice to meet you. Muslim women aren't supposed to shake hands and it gets so awkward bc she's just ignoring his hand but he keeps it out and we just all start laughing. And I swear to God, leading up to my wedding, EVERY single phone call I had with my dad he asked \"no shaking the ladies hands right?\" I would of assumed he told my brother this by now!\n\nMy grandmother wanted a picture with my FIL. Men also aren't supposed to touch women who aren't their wife or related to. But my grandma doesn't know this and she plants a big ol smooch on his cheek for the picture. Hilarious.",

I had never met the bride to be, because he moves fast and I live far away. Eric picks us (me, my husband and our kid) up at the train station a few days before the wedding, and tells me that his fianc√©e is a little on her guards with new people, and that it will pass very quickly, and that after that, she is very lovely. She (let's call her the Bride) knew me a little, because I was the one she asked many questions about pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding through Facebook when she had no one to ask, and me being her future husband's best friend, well, I of course accepted to support her when she needed it. Their first kid was born by that point, was about a year old.   \nHaving never met the Bride in person, when I arrived, I said \"Hi, I'm Mary :)\". She went \"Well, I know\" with a mocking laugh. And then she just left.   \nThat same day, we went to the beach, with two cars because we were many, and I went to Eric's car with the kids, and she was in her own friends car because you know, they came all the way for the wedding too and we all wanted to spend time with our own friends upon arrival. And I came from another country 3k km away, hadn't seen him in a very long time.   \nI sensed immediately once we parked that there was a big problem. And it only escalated from there. I was never out of line. My friend and I never had that kind of history.   \nI had to avoid him, avoid looking in his direction, avoid talking to him, but there was only so much I could do to still make it look normal. The Bride proper yelled at him on the way from the beach, because we were talking, each pushing our own babies in their strollers.   \nAfter a few days of that, everybody seeing that she was publicly bullying me, came the wedding. I will pass on all the anecdotes and stuff she said until the wedding, because otherwise we'd be here for a long long time. I always kept my tongue, always pretended everything was fine because it was her fucking wedding, and I was a guest, and I can behave. I was also just shocked by her behaviour and couldn't just react. I took it all, no problem. We had discussions with our common friends with Eric (Eric's and I'd common friends, he was never there, not allowed to spend time with us), we were all absolutely shocked.   \nComes the wedding, she is being an absolute bitch the whole day. I was making myself as little as I possibly could. Eric's family came to see me and told me that they saw what was happening, and they felt for me, and they are on my side, they support me. But everybody is scared shitless of her. Still nice to hear that they see, and I'm not inventing it. She is being horrible.  \nWell, she left her own wedding, drunk, had just got her driving licence the day before, and was taking the baby with her. Eric had to fight (verbally) to not let her go drunk with their baby (before midnight), and offered to drive them. He never came back to his wedding, no one danced a single second. The whole thing was a shitshow, and it was because of my presence.   \nShe's batshit crazy, so she'd have found another way to ruin it, she is sick, but the fact remains that my presence was her biggest issue that day/week.  \nAnd for someone who is so sickly jealous, she was hitting on Eric and I's common friends, one in particular. During the wedding.   \nI have not seen her after that, Eric was forbidden from driving us back to the train station and sent his father. I called him and told him I refused that, so he still brought us back. We had a chat in the car. Few weeks after, she made him block me everywhere, and she's reading his emails, so when I sent emails for his kid's or his BD, I never got an answer. Got one a few years ago, that was a one liner. I did not even bother responding.   \nSure got the group email a week after the wedding that thanked everyone for their presence during this magical day. It was a very small wedding as well, so I'm suffering from second hand embarrassment for that line. Everybody saw it was a shit show from start to end.",

            "text": "I have a ***George Soros wedding story***  for after my main story...\n\nWas a caterer at a really expensive wedding overlooking Rockefeller center in during the holiday season.  Two prominent New York Jewish families being bonded.\n\nBride and groom got way too drunk and started physically fighting in front of everyone on the dance floor while screaming in each other's faces. Like the bride trying to throw punches and the groom shoving her.\n\nThe groom's mother was also pretty blasted and came back into the kitchen to blame us (the kitchen staff) for \"ruining her baby's big day\" because apparently one of the hors d'oeuvres came out a few minutes too late and this was to blame for them getting too drunk and starting a public fist fight.\n\nI actually had permission to dip early from that shift and was getting into the elevator right as the groom was screaming obscenities and had to held up/back by multiple members of the wedding party.  I had to try really hard not to laugh  earlier when his mother screamed in my face how we should feel ashamed and how she \"wasn't going to pay a penny\" (as though hiring a team of 15 back-end chefs, 5 up-front-party chefs, 2 catering managers, and a team of wait-staff was something you can totally pay for after the fact....after everyone already ate).\n\nI don't know what happened after I left but I was pleased to leave when I did.\n\nNow for the Liberal boogeyman story....\n\nI did some of the prep for **George Soros' latest wedding** and while it wasn't ruined there were a few mishaps that were hilarious.  He imported a foreign team of chefs from the top michelin-starred restaurant in Europe.  They proceeded to get fucking hammered every night in NYC and could barely function the next day (or were at least nursing hangovers and half asleep for the first few hours they were there every morning, they were back to normal by the second half the day).   This went on for weeks.  Free vacation from Mr. Soros as far as they were concerned. I was a lowly kitchen-hand and this bigshot chef was nice to me though so I thought he was rad.  A lot of chefs are raging assholes and this guy patiently taught me how to break down alaskan king crab when i admitted I had no experience with such a task.*Stealth edit: you would be surprised how many chefs function while drunk on the job as a regular modus operandi. We had a few chefs who got sent home and were well into the 6-figure mark a few times while i was there.  Like, work all day, drink all night, not go home, and come back to the kitchen at 6:30am and pass out in their offices.  The europeans didn't do this, they at least went home to their hotels before strolling in the next day. Alcoholism and other forms of drug abuse are real issues in that industry.*\n\nSoros wanted all the herbs to be fresh so he actually had us buy an entire room full of potted herbs and edible plants that I had to rotate and water for weeks leading up the wedding. None of that made it to the wedding despite the plants being in good condition.  We gave them away to staff after the wedding.\n\nThe funniest bit was that one of the main dishes were imported lobster tail (that i personally had to help prep for hours on end) and the staff FORGOT to cook it, so at the last minute the chef (the imported big-shot who was hungover) decided that it was going to be served raw and he was just going to play it off like it was his intention all along.\n\nSoros apparently complimented him on how he had never heard of that before but that it was great and this guy was a culinary genius or some shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe weddings of the super rich are incredible wasteful.  There was a team well north of 100 people for just one of the nights of the Soros bash, and that was just from our company, and that's NOT including all the people who actually prepped the food BEFORE the day of the wedding (people like me who spent literally 8 hours just breaking up alaskan king crab with a cleaver while standing in a freezer).\n\n*edit 2: to all of those who are saying \"yeah right there is no way they forgot to cook the lobster tail....\" you probably don't understand just how much food was needed to be prepped. They had to dedicate an entire walk-in plus other facilities to just the prep for this one wedding. That's usually enough space to hold many weddings/functions worth of food.  Imagine a large bedroom just filled literally to the ceiling with meat and veggies (it actually wasn't just one walk-in, it was different sections of multiple walk-ins, but the space added up to be at least one full walk-in).*\n\n*Even with a team of dozens of cooks it can be hard to get everything out in time, even for a regular large wedding, never mind a billionaire's wedding. We're not talking about \"oh i forgot to heat up a platter of X,Y,Z with the sternos,\" we're talking about 100+ plates of something.  Even setting that up to be cooked is going to take some time, nevermind plating it and getting it ready AT THE SAME TIME as the other stuff it's supposed to come out with. Think of how many people fail at their regular thanksgiving dinner trying to get everything ready at the same time.  Now imagine that you are managing a team of 100+ people and there is a fairly strict time window for each course and dozens of things to prepare.  Even for a veteran head chef this is not a walk in the park.*  \n\n\nEdit 3:  To be clear, I don't think the executive chef did a bad job or was overly flippant with his responsibilities. Managing a wedding that large is an insane task and he honestly did a great job. He was calm, polite, and even though he was commanding a totally foreign staff of far less skilled people than himself he managed to impress his billionaire client.  I don't blame him  and his staff for living it up a little during their time in NYC.  I hope they had a good time and hit a big lick.",

This is a long read, so enjoy it (oh and its true...love to you N.)\n\nWas not best man but was partnered with groom's unpredictable sister (she was on prescribed medication once, heard voices and jumped off the roof of their home. Fortunately, a neighbor was watching her the whole time, thinking WTF? and when she jumped, it was only one story so she broke her feet-terrible but kept her from parents keeping her on meds). \n\nSo I was tasked to take B/W photos of wedding (even though a photographer was hired for the main body of work).\n\nSo, first, the church of the mass had double booked the priest, so the minister to perform was substituted with another, unfamiliar one. The alarm was going off as the substitute didn't have the alarm code. The flowers were late (people were being seated in the church as runner was laid and arrangements put out-and they were wrong arrangements. Alarm still going off as most were seated. After alarm off, wedding mass presumed.\n\nAfterwards, everyone leaves to head to the reception. About 25 miles away. As one to help, I give some folks directions and wait for the wedding party to finish up. They now need to get on the rental bus, and head to the reception, first for photographer, then that evening's event.\n\nI'm following the rental bus/limo, not even 2 miles from the church, and a moving truck, coming the other way, gets too close and shears of the limo-bus driver's mirror! The driver of the moving truck (Uhaul or Pennske-been too long to recall) switches places with her husband/boyfriend. The police arrive and I take a shot (should post it but I would need permission) of the wedding couple arguing with the cop. (you see, the limo-bus cannot operate without that mirror). As the bus-limo driver is rigging up something to fix the mirror, to get the bus going, as all are late now, the groom's bestman, his brother, is drunk and cursing, mooning and flipping off the couple that were driving the moving truck. The woman was upset, but she was telling the cop her BF was the driver (um, no, he wasn't. Isn't that why she is upset, officer?)\n\nWe finally get underway, losing atleast what seemed like an hour, when all of a sudden, the bus-limo gets pulled over by the same cop that was at the accident. Apparently, the woman was so upset at the bestman's colorful metaphors (but not sorry for lying to the officer that she was driving-I was following behind the bus and saw the whole thing), that the cop wanted everyone's name on the bus incase there was any insurance issues! (ahem fraud and that the officer was to do this BEFORE we left, so covering his ass).\n\nDelayed and frustrated and pissed off, the bride is trying to calm the groom down (he is almost yelling at the cop). Oh, its getting dark now, and I had no flash ready (film) to take any more nor wanting to piss the cop off. I walk over as the bus driver gets all back in the bus (we are just off the ramp to the interstate), and I talk to the cop, who is curt with me, and he asks me the wedding party name. I provide it and he stopped writing on his pad. He steps out of the patrol car, heads over to the bus-limo driver's window and tells him to go on and leave. As I run back to my vehicle, behind the bus, the groom looks at me and says, \"What did you say?\"\n\nI reply, \"I told them your last name. Guess your family has some pull!\" He then smiles, and smacks his head like... duh! Ever see The Godfather?  Seems the father of the groom, and mother, are \"known\" in the county and school district. Too well. Hint (Italian family). So the cop gets out and tells the bus-limo driver to proceed. (we found out a week later, that the cop told the tale to his pals at the precinct; the wedding party found no humor in it, and irony- the bride would have that cop's child in her class! Oh...just you wait...).\n\nSo then, party arrives late to the reception. The photographer is upset as he has lost three hours of light, but proceeds to round B/G up and get it done. I'm shadowing the sister because she's been known to ruin events (and wants center of attention). Turns out, her angry boyfriend shows up (this guy once pulled a knife out on her brother, the groom, in their own house!) and they have it out, but take it to the parking lot (good girl). I go looking for her as \"we have to dance together\" and the boyfriend and her finish fighting and he whips his little dick out (wish I had camera!) and pees on someone's car...classy.\n\nAfter returning to the reception, there is a commotion and its not good. Everyone was worried the groom's sister was going to ruin the wedding, when it turned out, the bride's brother had some \"mental issue\" and trashed at the bathroom, demolishing a stall! I guess I wasn't a good candid photographer as I was lit on champagne and hor doeuvres, and not really wanting to stick a lens as a paparazzi into some mentally unstable drunk (turns out, he had been on medication, but made bad decision to mix several drinks with it... he's not at all that unstable..it was uncalculated mistake- Do NOT take Medication and Alcohol together! Don't people know you and others can die from it!).\n\nSo it ended without further drama. The entire groom's family is one big arrested development. As of today, years later, the groom, a \"pathological\" liar would be proud of,  left his young son alone for several hours, while at some horror convention and lied about it (getting bj by some horror chick was just the part of the lie he denied), and lost his job...for months...never telling the wife. Then (I recall all this because I put the guy up for 3 months and he took advantage of my kindness) I realized for years, this groom, lied to me, to the spouse, to everyone...that is all he does! Eventually, they divorced and the wife was a saint for putting up with his shit for so long. Who knows where he ended up (Surprise: Florida!). And the bride? She's doing well, raised her family well without that POS, and moved on.\n\nMaybe it wasn't a complete ruin, but it sure was something I won't forget.",

I don't remember that many details, it's just that the way in which it was ruined was something I couldn't forget. You'll see why. It was all ruined the night of the wedding party, after everything had died down; people had gone home or were sleeping. Everyone...except two.\n\nSo this young couple in their twenties had just gotten married and the wedding party had gotten somewhat rowdy, as everyone had gotten quite drunk. Even the groom's little sister, who was only seventeen, had been allowed to drink. It hadn't gotten too off-the-rails during the party itself, though; people were largely just enjoying themselves. Eventually the party died down. Some people went home, but others were so drunk they had to sleep in guest rooms at location, the groom's sister included.\n\nAnyway, the bride had gone to sleep in the master bedroom by herself, grumpy and disappointed that her new husband hadn't joined her. Then, sometime later, she was awoken by the sounds of a man and a woman moaning together. So she got up to find the source.\n\nAnd she caught the groom having sex with his seventeen year old little sister in the living room. They were full siblings. He wasn't taking advantage of her or anything; it was entirely consensual, they were both into it. But they were both heavily influenced by alcohol and probably wouldn't have done it if they were sober.\n\nSo yeah...that wedding was ruined.",

Best man and his date end up taking care of bride and grooms child and staying in their honeymoon suite for the night. \n\nSource: I was the best man.\n\nEdit: I'll explain the \"slams head into sidewalk\" part. The groom was on his back on the ground, and the bride was on top of him. He's basically giving her a bear hug, while she's screaming and flailing. So as I come around the corner, all I see is a man holding a screaming woman, rolling around on the ground. I'm completely startled by what I'm seeing. Also, mind you it's dark out there. So when I threw her off of him, I was straddling his chest, and I put my palm on his forehead and pushed it to the sidewalk, maybe 3 inches. Just a quick reset button. I literally immediately said \"I'm sorry I hit you, are you ok man?\" He replied \"It's ok, I'm ok.\" All while still holding him.  Y'all are acting like I picked him up and dumped him straight on his head from 4 ft in the air lol. I was not trying to hurt him, or her for that matter, I was simply trying to end their physical confrontation. Hence why I stayed on top of him, tried to stop the kicks and pushed her away when she came back for more, and told her to leave, which is when we stormed off with the brides maid, that was the deescalation period. I wasn't holding him down so she could kick him. Now take my word for it or not, this guy would never hit her which is why I was so startled in the first place. Come to find out the groom was bear hugging her like that to prevent her from hitting him in the face any more, and they were on the ground because they were both hammered and tripped while she was hitting him. After I let him up he was basically realizing all the crazy bullshit that happened and was completely besides himself hence the punching of trees and the like. I couldn't control him any more which is why I asked for the officer, who was trying to help me get him into the hotel room up until the groom started yelling \"take me to jail! Take me to jail!\" In the middle of the lobby. You just can't reason with drunk people once they get going  So yes the story says \"slammed\" head into sidewalk which is true, but y'all's imaginations are going wild.",

The wongs wanted something  a bit more  simple and rustic and at better value but uncle Dave insisted (so i heard). Everything was as top shelf as it could be, the venue, the meals, the number of guests. I thought it was all a bit much but if uncle Dave is paying for it, I suppose it's okay. Then dave gets up for his father of bride speech and starts thinking it's comedy hour for racist jokes. One after another, it was honestly impressive how many there were, I remember looking over at my auntie (who I am biologically related to) and she had her head buried in her hands. Honestly, I was the same. I don't remember many jokes because i was trying to focus on anything else, pretending to inspect the chandelier, the cornaces, the cieling rose, fucking anything. I just remember at one point Dave saying, \n\n\"and the most important thing to remember in marriage, is 2 wongs dont make a w(h)ite...\"\n\n I looked over at the wong family and they were NOT impressed.\n\nThe room was on edge after that. Quan (the groom) stands up for his speech. And this is something I will never forget. He gets up and says, \n\n\"thank you to dave for the lovely planning of such a beautiful wedding, and more importantly, thank you to my father for paying for it all.\"\n\nYou could hear every one shuffle in their seats and cough in discomfort. Then he says,\n\n\"Thank you to my groomsmen, especailly my best man Michael, who fucked my wife last night...Thank you everyone for coming, but I think this wedding is over. Feel free to enjoy the drinks package and have a great night.\"\n\nI met up with my parents, and we all got out of there as soon as possible, it honestly nearly turned into a war between 2 families.

We wanted to postpone our Wedding until he was better or i  a nursing home, where he couls be cared for porperly. But everyone told us to go through with it since everything was already paid for and people had booked plane Tickets and so on. Even the doctors told us not to change the Wedding date since grandpa could die any day but also live for another 5 years. I bet by this far you guessed when he actually died- yup, it was our Wedding day. He was i  Hospital by then (had been for about a week) and he died close to them Moment we said 'I do'. My husbands father got the call from the Hospital when we left the church. Nobody told us about it, but they told everybody else. So many of our guests were sitting around crying and saying 'it's nothing' when we asked them about it. Our Wedding was very strange and tbh, I am still not over it (it was 4 years ago). We got condolences the morning after our Wedding and congratulations at his funeral. It was bizarre. And to top it off, my MiL LOVES being the victim. So it was of course her being the one to pity bc she couldn't enjoy her sons Wedding.\n\nYou know what makes it even more bizarre? A year later we had our first child and a week beforw we wanted to baptize her, my grandfather had a heart attack. This time we did reschedule. He died a day before the baptism would have happened.

Long Story short, she got a really really bad sunburn and got drunk (from like 3 glasses of wine) to a point where the ambulance was called. The groom also had to leave to throw up. They normally just didn't drink and underestimated the effect Alcohol would have on them.

I was a bridesmaid in a wedding that took place during an unusual snow storm in the DFW metro. Most of the ~150 guests flaked for good reason  because the roads were undriveable, so only about 20 people showed up. Picture the empty pews and reception hall. While the bride was getting ready, someone stepped on the train of her dress and it ripped clean off. The cake arrived, and fell over. Despite the total lack of guests, somehow the bar ran out of alcohol between the ceremony and reception. Anyway, come to find out the bride was already married to someone else. So that's all void anyway I guess? Seems about fitting.\n\n***EDIT with more shitshow info:***\nHow I found out about her being married - I found this out later when I saw her for my own bachelorette party and she told me she was getting a divorce, but not from Lawrence! (real name, sorry pal) Come to find out she hadn't ever bothered to get divorced from a prior ex, just kinda informally separated and never followed through with the papers. \n\nIf I'm telling more stories from this wedding.. I actually have a physical scar from this event. While there was chaos after her dress ripped, the best way I could be helpful in the flurry of people was to corral all of the bridesmaids' kids, since I was the only one there without kids. This included a 6 month old baby. After the bride got her dress stitched/mended/safety pinned together, she and all the other bridesmaids went across the street to the chapel, and I stayed behind and got all the little kids suited up in jackets and mittens and we began to walk across the street in a chain of one lady and 6 kids. But what I didn't know was that in the time between arriving to the venue and the ceremony starting was that the sun had set, and all the slushy ice had frozen into a shiny slippery sheet. So there was me, in a floor-length bridesmaid dress and high heels, six children holding hands in a chain link formation, and holding a very small baby in my arms as we all try and slowly carefully walk across the icy dark street to the venue. I slipped on the ice, and tripped and floundered to NOT DROP THE BABY, and in the process skinned the front of my ankle. I recovered quickly and just kept going. We arrived into the chapel, I unsuited the kids and lined up with the bride. I didn't notice the blood trickling down the front of my foot and pooling in my high heel until about halfway through the ceremony. Still have that scar 6 years later. The most lasting thing from that day.",

The Bride is a distant cousin of mine - she's a lovely human being, but always seemed a bit sad. I was about 8 or 9 I think. My great grandmother (the family Matriarch), Mom, and I go to see cousin marry the love of her life. Its a lovely ceremony. I remember thinking how beautiful cousin looked when she smiled. It was so rare to see her genuinely happy. Her Groom was a gentle, kind man she met while working at the local bank. He was a construction worker, and while he was built like a birck chicken house, he was a giant teddy bear. \n\n\nTime comes for the speeches. Maid of Honor and Best Man do theirs - all just beautiful and happy, celebrating the happy couple. Then, the Father Of The Bride, does his. \n\n\nThis motherfucker is stone drunk. He starts blithering on about how no one was good enough for his daughter (annoying, but not the worst bit). Then, his drunken speech turns completely around. This asshole looks at my sweet, finally happy cousin and says \"I wish you had died at birth. You were a burden. You ruined my marriage to your mother. You were never good for anything accept a piece of ass.\"\n\n\nYou could have heard a pin drop. The Bride is horrified, wailing as she ran out of the reception hall. Her mother is staring at the FOB in absolute horror. The FOB then confessed to us all that he started molesting my cousin when she was 5, raped her for the first time at 10. Said he started taking his frustration out on her since his wife became \"a cold fish\" after her birth. \n\n\nThe Groom shot up from the table and was on him before anyone had time to react. He is beating the absolute shit out of the FOB. My Mom grabs me and starts to go after the Bride, while my frail, 95+ year old great grandmother calmly gets up and makes a beeline for the FOB and Groom. The Groom is sitting on his Father In Law, busting his face. Great Grandmother gets up there, watches while everyone is trying to get the Groom off the FOB. My Mom stopped dragging me off to see what Great Grandmother would do.\n\n\nShe catches the Grooms eye and said \"Hold him, James\" (not the Grooms real name). Groom stops beating him, all the Groomsmen stop trying to pull him off, everyone is just kind of watching. \n\n\nMy Great Grandmother looks down at the semi conscious FOB, spits in his eye, and stomped the heel of her shoe right on his nose. If it wasn't broken from the Groom, it was broken then. \n\n\nThen she came over to Mom and I and said lets go check on cousin. Bride was distraught, convinced Groom would stop loving her BC of her father. The police came to break up the fight, FOB went to hospital, Groom got arrested; though the charges were dropped when the judge heard the circumstances. (I'm not sure how all that went down, I was a kid so I got the bare minimum on information) Groom immediately went home and told Bride nothing could make him stop loving her. He even got her into therapy. \n\n\nWhile FOB never saw legal repercussions, his wife did leave him, he was disgraced, and he left town to die as a drunk out of state. \n\n\nGroom didn't change how he looked at Bride. They are still married, have had two kids, and are incredibly happy.",

As I processed in and took my place by the pastor, I turned and looked at the crowd and realized I was standing in front of my brides family. \n\nApparently her 97 year old grandmother was seated early and didn't know where to go, and sat on the wrong side.

Grooms mom tests positive, so groom freaks out and tries to postpone the wedding last minute.  Brides mom is an even more controlling bitch than the bride, so the mom stepped in and insisted the wedding goes on.  Who cares if the entire wedding is just brides family? Get over yourself, groom! This is about the bride!  \n\nBoth sides of the family get into huge fights, grooms family says if he actually goes through with it he‚Äôs crazy and his parents and all 3 of his siblings (including sisters who were bridesmaids) decide they aren‚Äôt coming any more.  Bride and groom fight leading up to the wedding since she and her mom still demanded the wedding goes on.

He‚Äôs doing the in-your-face thing and chest bumping.  Next thing I know, the groom whacks him.  Not a smarten-up slap but a closed-fist, fully-cocked punch to the face.  The guy goes over the head table and webs out the glass behind it.  Not flight, but a hard enough hit to get him onto, and rolling over, the head table and smacking his head on the glass.  The room just erupts with most of them fleeing and maybe 15 or so jumping in.  \n\nI looked at my partner and said,‚ÄùGood time for a cig break.‚Äù\n\nAs we make our way along the wall from our station to the hall way door, a guy from the party gets in front of me, puts his hand on my chest, and asks where I think I‚Äôm going.

Everything went forward and at the reception, the bride‚Äôs father just stood in the corner drinking screwdrivers all night. Lots of people talked to him and he looked emotionless.  Basically, he showed no emotion, but you could see he was just depressed. \n\nIn the end, after her sweet husband couldn‚Äôt hold a job for more than five minutes (he never could) and he got picked up for dealing drugs for the umpteenth time, he went to jail for a long stretch. She divorced him and he threatened to kill her when he got out. He did it on a prison phone, she made a complaint, he got more time.  She met a guy fresh out of the service, he went to college, and eventually became an optometrist. Nice guy. I‚Äôm still friends with the family and he‚Äôs my optometrist. They‚Äôve got 5 kids and everyone seems super happy, even the bride‚Äôs father who doesn‚Äôt have to worry about his daughter being married to a drug dealing jailbird anymore. \n\nThis happened about 20 years ago.  According to the department of corrections website, he was released in 2017. I can‚Äôt find anything about him. It doesn‚Äôt look like he has any kind of internet presence. \n\nAnyway, that was a fun wedding. Could have cut the tension with a knife.\n\nEdit: Typo repair",

Nothing inherently ‚Äúbad‚Äù happened at the wedding, but the vibes were WAY off. All the guests from her side were extremely cheerful and excited for her, but her husbands side of the family...creepy. Just creepy. Stone cold expressions. Very unwilling to speak with anyone but their side of the family and disapproving looks towards anyone dancing and having a good time. They just sat there, didn‚Äôt drink, and then eventually left the outdoor reception early because they could smell weed in the distance. And of course they made a huge fit over it.\n\nBut...I tried to ignore it. Until my friend (the bride) started giving our other friends and I glances with expressions that clearly were meaning ‚Äúhelp me‚Äù and ‚Äúoh god, what am I doing here‚Äù - even during the ceremony. I tried multiple times to get her to tell me what was up, but she just kept saying ‚Äúnothing, I‚Äôm just sad‚Äù and other excuses along those lines.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to about 1.5 days later and I see that she had taken down her marriage status on social media, removed all pictures with her husband in them, and deleted all pictures from the wedding and posts about getting married. Clearly something was wrong since they should‚Äôve been on their honeymoon, so I called her and she just tells me that she‚Äôs divorcing him and starting over. That she hated her wedding and she realized she didn‚Äôt love him. Would not give me an explanation. Her husband seemed equally distraught and confused because he was even calling me for answers as to why she was leaving him. \n\nThat day was the last day I had a conversation with her. By the next day, she had announced her plans to start her life over and move to a new state and find new people and a new career. And she did. She never returned our calls again and eventually deleted all of us from social media. I reached out to her mom and her mom says she‚Äôs doing great, and I‚Äôve looked her name up from time to time as well. She really did start her life over completely. New friends and all. We‚Äôre basically dead to her now. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what the hell happened. She had been dating her husband for almost 5 years before they got married and they both were amazing people. I know his family was super religious, but neither of them were, and she frequently hung out with his parents despite their clashing religious beliefs. She had even told me numerous times that it has no effect on their relationship and she loved the family. That wedding was the turning point, and all of us felt the discomfort there, but I will never know what really happened.",

She just sat there and cried for hours.\n\n\nEDIT: Since so many people have responded, I'll share a bonus story from a friend of mine who also used to work in hotels.

Ceremony itself goes off without any issue. Reception become a big beer and booze soaked party. It then starts to run late so the catering manager tells the father of the bride that they've exceeded their time and they need to start shutting down. This leads to an argument involving several members of the wedding party \"Blah blah blah! Do you know how much I paid?! blah blah!\" They eventually comply but it stirs the inner white trash. \n\nThe party then spills out to the hotel bar where people keep drinking. Members of the wedding party are still stewing about the reception getting shut down and tempers are short. Finally something triggers the groom and he takes a swing at someone. He swings back. Groomsmen start swinging. Now it's a full on donnybrook. \n\nHotel staff manages to get them out of the bar and the fight spills out the front entrance of the hotel. Police show up and start trying to break things up. The groom at some point takes a swing at a cop and proceeds to get the shit beat out of him. The bride, who at this point was just standing on the sidelines screaming and talking shit (\"Kick his ass, baby!\") finally decides \"Well, I guess we're doing this.\" and walks up to a female cop and takes a swing at her. She chose the wrong female cop because this woman was apparently way more yoked than she appeared and takes the bride to the ground, brides faces hits a planter on the way down and busts her nose. She's now bleeding all over her wedding dress. \n\nBy this point the police wagon shows up. Several people are handcuffed and loaded up, including the bride and groom.

The ceremony was beautiful, but we all had sweat trickling down our backs, our fronts, down our legs and glistening on our arms, but in a gross and non-sexy way. Then we went into a nearby building (like a small clubhouse, big enough to technically put a roof over all the guests‚Äô heads, but definitely not big enough to host a reception in) because the sky was becoming angry.\n\nAs for the reception itself, that was to be held in one of those giant tents with fake windows on the side, pitched next to the spot where the ceremony had taken place. \n\nAs we watched from the safety of our solid-walled building, a storm descended onto the grounds, and proceeded to completely bully that reception tent into pathetic, whimpering submission. It was buffeted from all sides by a volley of blows, making it resemble a sobbing, unwilling dancer whose feet are pinned to the floor, so they can only frantically sway their upper body in a graceless, tortured dance. Meanwhile, the caterers, who deserve *all* of the medals, were bravely rushing back and forth between this frenzied, dying tent and their vehicles, salvaging the food and electronics within.\n\nAfter an eternity, the caterers burst through the door.

Once the storm was finished reminding this tent of the power of God, they managed to set everything back up in the tent, get the food back out and heated perfectly, and basically, when you walked back in, you never would‚Äôve thought a storm had happened if not for the wet grass outside.

Obviously said alarm went off mid wedding, reverberating around the church. The mother of the bride shot her sister daggers. Naturally the aunt had no idea how to turn it off in her panic. So the best man had to pick it up, walk the whole way down this long aisle with this phone ringing away.",

Safe to say the wedding finished very quickly afterwards.  Multiple ambulances and police arrived at the hotel and questioned us.  I even had a police officer come to my house to ask me questions the next week.  At least us workers managed to get out before finish.\n\nTL;DR I was working at a wedding, the bride's brother that was off his head on drugs started kicking the shit out of people, including the bride and his own mum, got arrested and ruined probably not only the night, but the whole family dynamic forever.",

She had 8 bridesmaids, only 5 made it to the wedding because they came down with severe food poisoning the night before. \n\nSo the wedding itself took place on this rooftop garden but the reception took place in this hotel in The Rocks that should‚Äôve been a 30 minute car ride away but somehow nobody remembered it was the middle of the city on a Saturday so was closer to 50-60 minutes. \n\nSo the reception took place in the ballroom on the 3rd floor & the stairs were actually incredibly steep so you had to be super careful coming up and down them. Most women took the approach of taking off their heels if they had to use the stairs.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that my other Aunt (the bride‚Äôs older sister) is a plus-sized women & gets drunk very quickly. Like black out drunk. So the party‚Äôs wrapping up around 2am, the happy couple having already left around 11pm. Two of the bridesmaids & the only sober groomsmen decide to help my aunt down the stairs because she‚Äôs so drunk she‚Äôs barely standing & can‚Äôt even keep her eyes open. I didn‚Äôt it happen but was later told that about halfway down the first set of stairs my Aunt just passed out. Out like a light. Everyone goes tumbling. The first bridesmaid somehow stays on the landing, unconscious after hitting her head but the other two keep going. The groomsman breaks his wrist somewhere along the way & the second bridesmaid knocks out her front teeth, blood everywhere.\n\nBecause it‚Äôs the middle of Sydney at 2am it takes the ambulances 35 minutes to get there through the crowds. Despite the fact that we were all adamant about not contacting the happy couple, someone obviously didn‚Äôt see why they shouldn‚Äôt call them & they showed up about 10 minutes after the ambulance. \n\nThere‚Äôs a lot of screaming, mostly from my Aunt, her new husband finding the whole thing hilarious which turns her rage onto him. Then they have to deal with the manager of the hotel. & honestly, I never spoke to him personally but I really hated that guy. All he kept saying was ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt sue. You signed papers.‚Äù Apparently the stairs were a safety risk, who know? They weren‚Äôt even trying to blame him, my aunt was in full agreement that the whole accident was her sister‚Äôs fault but the manager just kept reminding everyone that the hotel was not to blame. I was starting to think maybe it was their fault how much he was going on about it. \n\nThe last of the guests finally left while the sun was rising.

One day this grooms party comes through my bar. They‚Äôre on the bucks party thing before the wedding the next day. They‚Äôre pretty drunk at 4pm. I figured they started early and would finish early given they have a sunrise ceremony (worst idea in the world, FYI). \n\nAbout an hour later they‚Äôve left and gone to another bar on the island. Then the brides party comes through. Equally shit faced. \n\nI finished work at 9pm then came back 3 hours later to work in the night club. I get in at midnight. Start pouring drinks. It‚Äôs busy as fuck with like 250 people in the club. Around 1am the groom and bride parties roll in absolutely destroyed. They look disgustingly drunk. I‚Äôve no idea why security let them in because I wasn‚Äôt serving them. \n\nThey left about 45 minutes later. \n\nSo, roughly, they‚Äôd arrive back at their hotel rooms around 2am with the expectation that the bride and her party need to be up at 4am for hair and makeup to be done in time for a 715am ceremony. They all decide ‚Äúwe‚Äôll just stay up all night and keep drinking until the wedding!‚Äù At this stage they had to have been drinking for 15-18 hours.\n\nAnyway, ceremony time rolls around. She can‚Äôt walk down the aisle, which is on the beach, in her heels so she tosses them off. Groom and all their friends are drunk as fuck and can barely stand. They try to say their ~~vowels~~ vows but the celebrant can‚Äôt understand them so she isn‚Äôt leagally allowed to marry them because they‚Äôre too drunk to consent to marriage. \n\nWhole wedding is canned. \n\nA simple wedding, like the one they had, for the wedding party and 20 guests cost $35,000. So they wasted all that money to be told ‚Äúsorry, you‚Äôre drunk. I cannot legally marry you‚Äù\n\nEdit. \nBeing that quite a few people have said ‚Äúthis sounds like a fun way to spend your wedding. So what if you didn‚Äôt get legally married. Just have the reception and sort it out later‚Äù\n\nThey did have the reception. From what I was told, the bride passed out about an hour in. The groom threw up everywhere.

All in the same venue. \n\nThey had booked and paid for 250 evening guests. But 30 guests turned up, at most. My heart broke for this couple. A massive beautiful converted barn, loads of food and drinks, great music - but no guests.\n\nAt about 10pm (the venue was licensed until 11pm) the buffet food had barely been touched (the few who were there ate - but it hardly made a dent as it was planned for soooo many more people), I asked the mother of the bride if she wanted me to cover and refrigerate the untouched food so the new couple could take it home and her response of \"Oh no, there are still alot of people coming\" was the most awkward I've ever felt in my life. \n\nNo more guests showed. \n\nThere was a flash of car headlights in the distance about 10:30pm and the bride BEAMED when she thought it was late comers arriving.\n\nBut no, it was just taxi's arriving to pick up the few who were there.\n\nIt's the only event I have ever done where we didn't have to kick people out of the venue.

Her parents invited all their 'friends' to the evening function but in reality, it was just associates they wanted to flex on - resulting in no one giving a shit about an invite to a wedding where they didn't know the bride or groom. It was basically just a networking event for the brides parents.\n\nEdit, for those asking: I believe the guests did rsvp..

Spent all day with the couple from 9am through till 2am the next morning when we left. I could see how genuinely in love they were. It was only a day but I got to know them quite well and really liked them both. \n\nThe next morning, I get a call from the photographer and his voice was shaky. He explained that the groom had been murdered that night after the reception party. Three guys had broken into their bungalow to steal wedding gifts. The groom got out of bed to stop them and they executed him in front of the bride. I was in shock for about two weeks. This story was in South Africa if that helps explain how or why this happened. The next weekend, the photographer and I went to the bride's house to present her with the photos. We'd worked together to get the job massively accelerated so she had the photos of her husband. We did it at our own expense and didn't charge her a penny for the day or all the prints and album. Sort of the least we could do. Because my photos didn't matter as much, I'd been able to simply capture those natural moments between them, rather than staged wedding photos. So they had the normal album pics but also about 150 snaps of just them being a couple. She was in tears from the moment we arrived till we left a few hours later. \n\nShe was a shadow of the women I'd met only a week earlier. That shit still haunts me.\n\nEdit: I didn't expect this story to get the attention it has. I'm sorry for any upset this has caused anyone reading this but I believe it's an important reality check. I loved south Africa in a lot of ways, but it's a very troubled place with insane murder and rape rates. My story is by no means unique or even particularly shocking by south African standards.

I've got friends who were diagnosed with PTSD stemming from their time there too.

For context, her family was terrible on both sides (abusive father, neglectful alcoholic mother, and step parents who didn't care about her much) and she basically ran to my father to get away from it all when she was 15. Bigger problem was, my dad was 26, also abusive, and just a real fuckin shitshow of a person. On my father's side of things, he hated his mother and blamed everything wrong in his life on her (as he did to most women in his family, later doing it to my stepmom). So the wedding was doomed to be terrible. \n\nIt started when my stepmom was walking down the aisle. She'd reconnected with her father in the last year and had recently been in a fight with her stepfather, so it was just her dad walking Her. There was a branch in the way (outdoor wedding) but he pulled it out if the way for her. As she thanks him, he lets go and flings it back into her face and literally collapses laughing. She awkwardly chuckles, no doubt knowing he is going to get mad at her if she shows she's upset, and the day continues but she's visibly upset. \n\nAfter the toasts, some people didn't drink the champagne that had been set out. The one thing she had asked of her mom was that she not drink -- she was even given sparkling juice rather than champagne. So while stepmom is changing into her reception dress, her mom goes table to table pounding down all of the alcohol she can get her hands on. A cousin of mine who doesn't know what's happening starts chanting \"Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!\" and stepmom walks back to her mom downing the last one and denying everything. Cousin slips out the tent once he realizes what's going on and leaves the two alone to argue. Stepmom comes out crying a few minutes later, goes back to her car, and doesn't come back for a good 20 minutes. \n\nWhile all of that is happening, grandma pulls up and starts cursing out my dad for a ton of shit, including marrying a kid (stepmom was 25 at this point) who she hates, not letting her invite a friend to the wedding, and him owing her a bunch of money. Dad tells her to fuck off and she leaves. \n\nThen my dad got mad at my stepmom for being gone so long, accused her of either \"being a baby\" for crying or of lying and cheating on him. So she sat down on the fringes and tried to not cry and also remain visible to my dad for the next several hours. \n\nThey may have been dating for 10 years, but the marriage only lasted 6 months.",

After a while of having fun, we hear some rumbling. Not uncommon, we‚Äôre less than a mile from an Air Force base. Then it happened. A group of about 5-10 people literally fell THROUGH the dividing wall.

Early on because of distance and later in life because of choice. \nOne of my cousins was getting married and my Dad said we all had to go, so we got in the car and drove several hours for my Cousin to marry a man named, as far as I know, \"Spanky\". That is even how the priest said his name. \nPrior to the wedding Spanky must have been pre-gaming as he was so drunk that his groomsmen had to prop him up during the ceremony. They get married despite this and then the reception came after and the real party began. \nWe are in small town Kansas and they're having an open bar. Word gets around town that this is happening and people start showing up that have nothing to do with the wedding to get free drinks. Which they get because there's no organization and the event is just in disarray anyway. My brothers and I are younger at this time so we're just people watching. How much my extended families have fucked up their lives from drinking and seeing it first hand probably has a lot to do with my brothers and I hardly drink. \nMy cousin is at the reception opening up the gifts and being annoying about it. Spanky is belligerent. Around this time they become aware that people are showing up and drinking for free. Spanky decides that he is the man here and he needs to kick these people out himself. \nHe walks over with several of his friends and the offending group is situated around the bar. Jeans, flannel shirts, cowboy boots and matching hats. Typical rural Kansas attire. \nThe kerfuffle gets loud fast as both sides are peacocking trying to get the other to swing first. At this time my cousin decides that this is ruining her day and she runs over to stop it. Spanky is winding up by this time and she gets in the middle as he releases the first and only punch straight into his newly wed wife's face. She goes down hard. The scene erupts into madness with family all over running over to stop this and check on her. During this the police show up and the reception is broken up and everyone leaves. \nThe marriage lasted three months.",

They split up pretty much right after the wedding but remained married. Last I heard they still talked and lived in this weird limbo space being married but not being together.",

We have a huge family and hardly anyone showed from our side as the drive was so long. I think the bride thought her family would come around and it would be this uniting event but they didn‚Äôt. They have a table of people from her church. Her pastor and others. I even overheard one of them commenting that almost no one was at the wedding and the pastor hushed her and said that‚Äôs why we are here in case they didn‚Äôt show so it doesn‚Äôt look so bad. \n\nThe wedding theme was Camo with the bride wearing a bright hunting orange ribbon tied around her waist and her dress completely head to toe real tree Camo. All the bridesmaids are also in full Camo dresses. It just looked bizarre. The place they rented is where they got married and held the reception. It was full of dozens of dead animal taxidermy. I mean probably 70+ dead animals staring everyone down and in the backdrop of their reception. The person marrying them looked like he was just trying to get it over and get the hell out. \n\nMy Uncle was in charge of food. He was doing a pig roast. Somehow he fucked it all up. Wasnt even close to ready. Two hours after dinner was supposed to be served they just serve it anyway. It‚Äôs raw. There is hardly anything else to eat. I mean like a pasta salad, some corn and some bread and butter. No appetizers. We are all starving. \n\nThe groom gets pissed after dinner about the fact that dinner was all fucked up. He paid for a whole pig and rented a smoker and the uncle said he knew what he was doing. He punches the wall hard in a hallway off of the reception area. Everyone can hear him yelling and most guests were within eye sight to see him punch the wall. I have no idea if he broke anything but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. His knuckles were bloody and he was wincing from time to time the rest of the night grabbing at his hand. \n\nAfter ‚Äúdinner‚Äù the idea was to go shooting. That‚Äôs right. The wedding was held at a shooting range (thus the dead animals staring us down). Great idea with super pissed off bleeding groom.

My now husband and I are an hour from heading out to the place where we get Checkers, and then the place where we were going to watch fireworks with my parents, and my sister who was going to marry us on the side of the street while wearing an inflatable dinosaur costume. Husband hates suits, and I promised him when we started dating that if we got married, he was allowed to wear jeans and a t-shirt, and all I wanted was a ring-pop. (Yes we're adults. It sounds god damn ridiculous I know but it's my wedding and outside of just signing the papers at the courthouse, this is all I wanted to do. Yes, it was god damn hilarious.)\n\nWe had just gotten back from my husband's parents house, I believe, where we had spent the day. I feel bad for not inviting his family to our \"celebration\" but it's mostly a tradition I have with my parents to view fireworks on the 4th of July, because it's ALSO their wedding anniversary, and I feel very strongly about it, and keeping it as an important day in my life.\n\nHusband's parents are blowing up his phone before we're even at my parent's house.\n\nTo preface this, at his parent's house, I was talking to his aunt about how that I did not want to take my husband's name, since I don't like it and there is already a relative of his with my exact name, and their last name who is his cousin. But instead of just keeping my last name, or hyphenating both, we were going to combine them! Into \"Lukiss\"  which I thought was very clever and unique, and pretty cool!\n\nI had the conversation in front of my husband's grandfather as well. I was saying things along the lines of \"I don't feel like it's a dishonor to the family or anything to take the name, we both agreed I don't have to\" and stuff like that. Well guess what guys? It was apparently fudging dishonor on the family not to want to take his last name!! And apparently my husband had never mentioned any of this to them, so when my husband's grandfather told his parents of my conversation, they were really upset! Apparently it was sprung on them out of nowhere, and I had no idea they didn't know, or would take it so badly. \n\nWe get to my parent's house and my husband ends up having a long phone conversation with his parents admitting to sort of hiding things from them (like smoking cigarettes, which he did hide from me at first but it's ok now), among other things. He wanted to justify us combining our names as \"two trees growing together and merging\" or something along those lines. I don't remember his analogy, it was very poetic and sweet.\n\nAfter that, the day went as we expected, but I was in a bit of a sour mood because of his parents/family freaking out over a name. I mean, of course obviously names have significance, we were going to change both of ours! And if not, I didn't want his name; as with my dad only having daughters, and I don't know how many people have my last name still in the family, I wanted to keep mine and pass it on. I just didn't take into account that this would cause a huge upset.\n\nAnyways, we ended up not changing our names, despite signing the certificate on the day, along with doing other important things, with our new names. Long story short with a lot of confusion as newlyweds and no one at Social Security or the Courthouse being of much help AT ALL, found out that it's $400/person with a court date to change your last name/identity (basically), but it's FREE to take your husband's last name. (This is in Florida)\n\nBig fudging whoop now, I kept my last name and he kept his but we're married. Changing our last name is still a maybe, like maybe when we have kids, but I don't know anymore.",

Do we call the cops?\" and  his buddy says \"Nothing\". They pulled down the wooden shutter and closed the bar. Sat on the floor and just listended to a Jerry Springer style fight happening.

We did all the pre wedding stuff, getting things setup and finally, all sat down. I was sitting at the end of the pew closest towards the middle. Second row, left side. \n\nThe wedding was going through its stuff. They were up there talking and I was spacing off. The alter had like 4 stairs up to the landing they were on, and on the right side behind the groomsmen there was the choir section, it had a wooden railing that enclosed it. Right before the I do's one of the groomsmen fell straight back. Didn't try and catch himself. His hands were still crossed in front of him. He fell back and hit his head on the railing. It was a sick noise. It was prolly the only thing I actually saw that day where I wasn't zoned out. \n\nHe apparently had a brain aneurysm. They said he was likely dead before he ever hit the railing. The rail broke his neck. obviously, the wedding stopped for a couple hours. They decided to finish after that. Crazy part was there were halos around this guy in every picture from that day. I am not religious or anything, but that shit was freaky.",

We had set fake flooring down which became incredibly slippery, causing multiple staff to fall over at some point. Everything was soaked: the table linens, the flowers, the chair cushions, the seat markers, and the catering staff. The DJ couldn't set his equipment up so he just sat around on his phone.\n\nWhile trying to get things better rearranged, the groom decided he could help us by constantly coming over to complain about how long we were taking.

The dinner service was rushed because everyone was hungry, and there were no speeches  because of the rain. Some people tried to dance, but the floor was wet and the music was coming from someone's phone so they would've had better luck at a frat party. \n\nThe wedding ended early and the bride and groom retired to their rented house looking like they wanted to forget the day even happened.",

One male sustained a serious leg injury.  \n>  \n>The wedding was stopped at that point. Well-dressed people could be seen leaving the River Drive venue past midnight, some in BMWs and a Lamborghini. Many, though, said they didn't hear anything at all.  \n>  \n>Compressed air cylinders and CO2 tanks are typically used at weddings used throughout the night by the DJ as CO2 blast guns and other effects.  \n>  \n>DJ and entertainment companies use CO2 canisters typically for handheld guns and cannons or jets that are attached to a surface or a lighting truss, Andrew DeLessio of Twilite Entertainment said.

I called up the groom who was enjoying the morning of his wedding and let him know. He just started laughing hysterically and was pretty calm about it. He trusted I'd figure something out, so I set off.\n\nThere's about 3 hours leading up to the wedding time. I decide to call Men's Warehouse.

And we purchased the suits, didn't rent them. **Luckily** this particular MW had on-site alterations, but they still were out at least a week.

We were a pretty tight group back then and all of our sig others had become friends, too.  One guy had moved away but came back to be in the party.  That guy got really drunk and apparently insulted everyone in the wedding party including the bride to the point that she ran out of the reception crying. \n\nI knew none of this until we were driving back to the shitty little rural hotel.  We were traveling in a couple of vehicles and that guy was not in our van and that's when I heard about everything.  Even my GF at the time was part of the insult onslaught.  I was furious.  I was carrying a bottle of water when we walked into the hotel and I felt someone punch it out of my hand from behind.  I turn, and it's him.  I lose it and I grab him by the jacket, drive him backward, and pick him up slam him against the wall.  Totally not like me and everyone is shocked. We all storm off.  Instead of us staying up late and partying, everyone just wants the day to be over.  \n\nA few minutes later there's a knock on my hotel door.  It's him.  He's crying.  He apologizes and explains that his wife has been cheating on him.  I was furious when I opened the door and now I'm confused as hell.  He walked off, I closed the door, and after a few moments--with GF's blessing--I tracked him down and we ended up staying up all night talking.  He's devastated. Of all my friends' wives/GFs--his wife was my favorite.  I'm devastated for him. I stood up in their wedding just the summer before.  \n\nThe next morning at breakfast, my friend is public enemy #1. It's not my place to blab his story.  I've told my GF but she's still angry about him.  Others are wondering if tempers will flare today and all I could say is \"we talked, he apologized and I understand what happened last night.\"  It's all very awkward because I can't condone how he acted at the reception but I also genuinely hurt for my friend.  I couldn't look at my friend's wife at all.",

The day before the wedding we spent the entire day drinking at the indoor pool. It was a great time. 3am rolls around and the guys are hungry and I volunteered as the least drunk to drive. So 5 of us pile in a small rental car and go to an all night cafe. We were all still in our bathing suits and floppy floppy‚Äôs. Everyone is drunk and we all chowed down. We leave the cafe around 4 and I start driving us home when we got lit up by flashing lights. Apparently I went the wrong way on a 20‚Äô section of the road when leaving the parking lot. The cop smells alcohol and asks me if I‚Äôve been drinking and I say ‚Äú I had a couple‚Äù and he asks me to get out. I tell him I‚Äôd rather just do the breathalyzer since I didn‚Äôt feel like keeping us out any later and he says he doesn‚Äôt have one. So I get out of the car in flip flops and a wet swimsuit and it‚Äôs in the 50‚Äôs (I was not prepared for the colder weather). I asked again for the breathalyzer and was denied. Windows down on the car and my friends had their heads down waiting for me to get arrested for a DUI. I proceed to fail the test twice in a row according to the cop (cold and in flips flops threw off my balance) and finally another cop pulls up with a breathalyzer about 30 minutes after getting out of the car. I blew a 0.0 and the cop taps on it and makes me blow again. 0.0 again. I had nursed two beers the entire day so I knew I wasn‚Äôt drunk. I won‚Äôt drive drunk or anywhere close to it but my friends were drunk and thought I was the one dumb enough to drive us. He finally lets me go after lecturing me about my driving and I get in the car.

Very short aisle.\n\nMy stepmom had some ideas about the song she wanted to play as she was coming down the aisle and couldn't decide so she wound up putting together a playlist.  Like a fifteen minute playlist, to walk down an aisle that takes about five seconds to walk down at a normal walking speed.  She walked as slowly as possible and was at the altar before the first song was over.\n\nThen we all just stood there awkwardly waiting for the music to end.  I was not comfortable in my wedding outfit, it was miserably hot in there, I could feel drops of sweat rolling down my back, and nobody thought to just.  Turn the playlist off and save it for the reception.  The entire rest of the ceremony was shorter than her playlist.  It was painful.\n\nAlso, my sister and I hated our stepmom so much that when it came time to throw the birdseed (no rice because that's dangerous for wildlife!), we both grabbed as many prepared bags of seed as we were allowed and began just ABSOLUTELY BEANING her with seeds ü§£ I vividly remember her squinting awkwardly and spitting out birdseed that had gotten caught in her lips.

Nothing nice, just a cliche \"country\" weddng with Mason Jars for cups type shit.  I have to say, I dislike this cousin and her husband very much.  They rented the apartment next door to me and my wife and our newborn, throwing parties every weekend, riding dirtbikes and 4 wheelers around the house at all hours, just no regard for anyone else.  My cousin especially, who was 2 faced and conniving and would turn our requests to keep it down into an attack on her where she would become the victim.  Well the night before the big day, the groom and his sophisticated buddies got piss drunk out at my firepit out back, and proceeded to break/burn most of our outdoor furniture with a bunch of laughs.  They woke up to get ready for the big day and immediately started drinking again.  The wedding kicked off early afternoon and although the groom was visibly drunk he got through the ceremony ok.  He wasn't around for much more after that though as he passed out in the grass less than 2 hours after the wedding started.  Someone put a blanket on him as my side of the family walked around him and laughed.  I'll never forget his new father in law (a police chief) looking down at him in disgust.

The wedding was between my Italian cousin and his Polish wife. Maybe the hall was a good price. Anyhow‚Ä¶ they hired a live band to play music for the night. There was a small sign taped to the stage that said ‚ÄúRequests possible. Ask between songs‚Äù. Fair enough. However, for the first 3 hours the band exclusively played what I believe were polka dances. It‚Äôs worth noting my cousin‚Äôs wife‚Äôs family were Polish but most of them had been living in southern Ontario for their entire lives and didn‚Äôt even speak the language. Nor had my cousin requested ‚Äútraditional‚Äù music, he wanted just regular danceable reception stuff. After hours of that, some of the guests started requesting other songs, just to switch things up for fun. The lead singer in the band got up to the mic, unleashed a tirade of some of the most foul language and insults I‚Äôve ever heard upon the collected guests, told everyone to eff off and die, threw the mic into the crowd and then stormed out. The rest of the band followed him out. Needless to say, that pretty much ended the night. \n\nThen there was a wedding I attended with my parents (friends of the family‚Äôs son getting married). It was in a super fancy stock exchange building and was uber formal. During dinner, my mother accidentally knocked the candle on the table over and lit the tablecloth on fire.

Now, earlier that day, my wife's cousin had seen my brother (engaged) making out with and groping my sister-in-law (dating someone else at the time, she is my brother's ex of 5 years from college). My wife also knew that my brother had been sexting with her sister while he was dating his now-fiance. So my wife and my brother step outside and he starts yelling at her because he had been \"forced\" to walk with her sister down the aisle during the rehearsal because she was the maid of honor and he was the best man. Too late to change, but clearly not my \"best\" man. At any rate, I ended up going outside and joining the shouting match. She basically said \"Listen, if I wanted to make your life difficult, we wouldn't have you walk down the aisle with my sister, we would show your fiance the sexts, but we're not interested in that. We literally just want to get married.\" My brother took that to mean \"Oh so you want to blackmail me.\" No. Not what she said. It finally ended with me saying \"I think you should go.\" He did so. He was my best man the next day, the whole wedding went smoothly and was honestly the best day of my life. 8 months later, my sister in law tells my brother's fiance about the sexts and making out. My brother tries to lie to his fiance's face. My SIL provides material proof of everything. My brother, in bad faith, lies and backtracks as much as be can. He then left their house, called my SIL and cried about how his fiance was going to leave him and he wasn't going to have help with his rent, car payment, etc. But the truth finally came out. 3 months after that, my brother tells me he wants me to be a groomsman (they were still together) but I told him I had concerns about doing that because of what had happened, but that I loved him and would show up either way. Just the groomsman thing that I didn't feel good about. Proceeds to berate me on the phone, saying that he'll make sure nobody in the family talks to me again. Spoiler...they did. But other than at my grandmother's funeral last summer, we haven't talked since. The ordeal got my uninvited from my younger brother's wedding because he didn't know what to do, and obviously got me uninvited from the wedding my older brother with whom I had the spat had. Not sad about the latter because my older brother isn't a particularly desirable person to be around, but was disappointed because my younger brother is a decent guy and his wife, unlike my older brother's wife, is actually also super nice.

They were a Nigerian woman and Norwegian man, and both quite superstitious. The DJ (that they opted to arrange themselves) turned up late, so they weren't set up for the walk down the aisle. The bride just stood there for an awkwardly long time, staring at the husband down the aisle, steadfastly refusing to start walking until he had the track ready. It was like 5 minutes before one of the bridesmaids helpfully started singing in an overly joyous tone to try to make her own acapella version of the bridal march song. It just made it way more awkward. I tried to make things better during the reception (because the cultural differences were stark), and it was almost getting back on track in time for the first dance. The DJ (who'd been given the song to play on a thumb drive) played a slightly different version of the song with different timing, so their highly choreographed dance didn't quite work, they were sort of scurrying about trying to get in place and at one stage he was meant to lift her but couldn't.\n\nThe only other interesting one was when the bride came back a few weeks later to say she'd found her was having a long term romantic text-based affair with and old school teacher.

We already had our first dance, had eaten and were getting our dance on before we did cake and such.    I found all of this out after the wedding because the people who knew what was going on were keeping me away from it as best they could.  Anyway, my sister was outside crying, trying to be by herself to get it together to come back in and dance.  After my \"father\" decided to tell her she hurt his feelings because she was ignoring him at the wedding and his family was here and she was embarrassing him, he told my brother he wasn't welcome in his home, and told my other sister that she needed to go take care of our youngest sister because she was outside crying.   My \"father\" and sisters have always had beef, he thinks family owes him everything and he doesn't realize he's toxic and we don't want him around after he and my mom got divorced.   He's convinced she turned us against him... so drama, should have known, right?   I thought he would act like an adult and be cordial on my wedding day....I was wrong.   After he told off my sister, my brother and spoke to my other sister, he came up to me and said goodbye and said he spoke to my sister and she's crying.   He left his tux on the floor of the changing area for one of my groomsmen to take back for him and went outisde- I thought he'd left.   About 10 minutes later, I saw my brother in laws - both my sisters were married - head for the door followed by most of the male guests at the wedding.   I was not allowed to go outisde, so the story goes - Dad was leaning against his truck smoking a cigarette and my brother in laws were at the entrance to the venue smoking.  Dad chirps about my sistsr being a bitch knowing it will set bro in law off so they head down to the truck and they ask him to leave.   He doesn't,  words are spat back and forth and dad throws a punch, misses and all hell breaks loose.  My two bro in laws \"jump him\" and some of mom's side of the fam get kicks in when he's down.   The cops are called by the venue staff and he's escorted off the property.    My bro in laws and sisters leave.  My brother leaves followed by my dad's side of the family: grandma, uncles and aunts, cousins and family friends.   Half of the guests are gone, my husband is so pissed,  but we continue with the show.   I paid for the wedding with the help of my mother in law and we did a lot of stuff DIY but still paid over $10k, so I didn't want to call it short for the guests that were still there.    I regret it because I never asked him for anything and the one day I needed him to be my dad, he let his ego and narcissism get in the way.   My sisters and bro in law apologized but dad doesn't think he did anything wrong and still thinks I owe him everything because we are \"family\".",

Never thought I‚Äôd get emotional from that sort of thing but the emotions are so high from everyone that it‚Äôs hard not to. Also saw my hard-ass, kind of a dick uncle (Father of the bride) trying to hold back sobs, which was a moment of vulnerability that was nice to see :‚Äô)\n\nEdit: Confused ceremony with reception üòÖ",

Giacomo trying to be funny or cool, decided to joke around and eat a slice of cheesecake inside of a roast beef and cheese sandwich in one bite. Giacomo chokes on the sandwich. And goes and steps away for 3 minutes or so to get some air. When he comes back he tries to say something to someone at the table, where he then collapses backwards after we assume he didn‚Äôt get enough oxygen. This is the last time Giacomo was fully conscious. From here he went to the hospital where he was pronounced brain dead and later died. Giacomo had a serious problem with cocaine and other drugs before he became clean as an adult so that could have attributed to his death.",

Two days before the wedding, the puppy randomly died without explanation. I thought wow, that's some bad luck. The wedding day was probably 90 degrees F and it was an outdoor wedding. It was miserable. The bride was not overweight but she was still in a very tight wedding dress and I guess it was really hot in there. During the ceremony, I was kind of not paying much attention, until someone in the audience screamed \"catch her.\" I snap back in it just in time to catch the bride who had just passed out. I think everyone else is in shock and more or less just watching. I sit her down and grab some water from the random woman in the front row. Time literally stood still because no one even moved until I said \"anyone want to help?\" or something in a panicked tone. She comes back and they finish the wedding. After the wedding, she still wanted to do a bunch of outdoor pictures. She got light headed three more times that afternoon during pictures. After the second time, I ran and got a chair for her to pass out in. One of the grandfathers needed an ambulance during the reception because of the heat. The ambulance got stuck in the field and me and another guy had to use our SUVs to try and pull it out so they could get to the hospital. What a mess. But, on the lighter side, they're still happily married and have a kid on the way. \n\nIn my own wedding, the DJ did the generation dance thing. It came down to two sets of grandparents. Both of which the grandmothers suffer from dementia unfortunately and it was late and they were having some sundowners. Both sets were so keen on beating the other that they had danced way past the years married and the grandmothers ended up yelling at each other and my brother had to separate them.",

My friend had went to college or something with the bride, but had said that she hated the groom because he cheated on the bride but she is forcing marriage out of co-dependence issues. Nice.\n\nFlew into Dallas, rented a car, and stayed in super sketchy motel in Waco. Ga-ross. The morning of we \ndrove out to farm lands and when I saw the crops I thought, where are we? We pulled up to this trailer / small hall and when I got out I saw there was maybe a small lake nearby.\n\nWhen we walked in the bride and groom were getting dressed in front of each other with the grooms men and brides maids. I was like uh? Did we walk in by mistake? The bride goes hey! Come on in. People were running around in street clothes, boxers, and the such.\n\nShe hugged her friend but the groom nor his friends never said hi. So we walk outside and there was a small setup under a metal patio. My guess was it was a mobile hall made to do weddings. There was a few people there so we congregated. \n\nSomeone walked out and said OK everyone, the wedding is about again please walk down yard to the water down there. As we were walking, I saw a little awning with some flowers but as I got closer to the water I realize there were cows in it and they were starting to exit to the property across the fence. The water was brown, and the bank was muddy. We were literally in somebody‚Äôs farm property.\n\nWe and the rest of the guests walked up and saw metal brown chairs (the kind you see in high school assemblies) just randomly placed next to the awning. We all started to sit down but then shot right back up because the seats were super hot from the Texas heat. I could hear a few girls starting to get pissed because of the short dresses. Some just decided to stand. Asses burnt. \n\nThe ceremony begins. The bride and the gang starts to come down. Kind of random themes and music. Then the groom comes down with his friends and they are all wearing storm trooper masks. Mind you, I‚Äôm down for a Star Wars wedding but nothing else with Star Wars themed so it seemed a little out of place. Some people looked back and giggled but most people thought, OK? \n\nSo when the groom came up the ceremony began and while the pastor was talking, they laughed the entire time. When it came time to pull the rings out, the bride and groom were laughing so much that I think they almost dropped the rings or some thing. The vows were a joke. I don‚Äôt remember in detail but the grooms went something like ‚Äúyeah I think you‚Äôre cool...haha, I‚Äôd like to marry you...haha\". By then, people in the audience stopped laughing and started to whisper to each other asking what is going on?\n\nSo once they did the smoochy face someone from the family announced OK everyone, time to walk back to the patio and grab yourself some food. So we all walked back and there was some Qdoba with some Budweiser being served.\n\nThe first dance came up and the bride began to dancing with her father which was the most awkward dance I‚Äôve ever seen. There was no emotion between the two. They didn‚Äôt look at each other, didn‚Äôt say anything, just seems like they were like OK let‚Äôs just get this done. And then while they were dancing, someone else came up and started dancing to near the end of the song\n\nI said to my ex friend what the hell is going on? She said I have no idea. This is a mess. I could see the faces of the other guests and they were so lost. Everything else about the reception was awkward as balls. The speeches from the grooms friends were about him the entire time, didn‚Äôt mention much about the bride but said something like good luck you too. Love and shit.\n\nAnyways after all the things were said and done, the groom and his friends never came to thank us for coming or introduce themselves in anyway. Not that I care personally, but if someone traveled half the country to your wedding, it would be at least courteous to acknowledge them and thank them for coming.\n\nSo it was time to go and that was that. The trip wasn‚Äôt an entire bus because I got to see my cousin who I had never met. She‚Äôs awesome. But I‚Äôll never forget how shitty this wedding was.\n\nTLDR - Shitty planned wedding in Waco Texas. In the middle of farmland and some mobile trailer hall. No consistency. Bride and groom getting dressed in front of each other and friends and guests. Burnt Asses from metal chairs next to a poop brown lake with a muddy bank with tons of cows swimming. Star wars masks on groom and his friends. Qdoba food and awkward reception. Groom was a cheater and bride co-dependent.",

They don't even like being around each other, but they both wanted to get married to whoever would take them, so there they were. \n\nHere's a list of what went wrong:\n\n* Wedding was outdoors in October, in an open field with no electricity, water, or bathrooms.\n* Two tiny RV's were brought in to serve as bathrooms/changing rooms for 150+ guests for seven hours. \n* Bride's grandmother (A rather rotund woman) got stuck in the door to one of the RV's. Groomsmen had to pry her out.\n* Mother of the groom (My mom) was instructed to make four cakes for the wedding so that the couple could save money. All are delivered and then left out on a table in the sun for several hours, sticking them to inside of their boxes and making a mess. \n* First look photos were a disaster, as the groom's reaction wasn't enough for the bride and she was visibly angry about it.\n* The ceremony starts and the bride doesn't want to go through with it, suddenly. Bridesmaids have to convince her that it's just nerves, she nearly pukes on her way to the aisle. \n* When it's time for the bride to come down the aisle, groom pulls out a guitar and begins singing a break up song to her as she walks down. Lyrics are not subtle. \n* After the ceremony, bride refuses to walk back up the aisle next to the groom, he is instead told to follow behind her and carry her train and veil. She still seems angry.\n* Bride and groom split off at the reception and refuse to look at each other, eat together or even acknowledge that this is their wedding. They have to be forced back together when it's time to cut the cake or take photos. At one point, the groom is found a mile away in a neighboring field.\n* The catering team hadn't expected to be without power, so all the food is cold. \n* First dance goes poorly as the bride and groom are basically just holding on to each other and swaying slightly in place. Their song of choice was \"Flightless Bird, American Mouth,\" from Twilight. \n* Majority of guests file out after this, including me and my husband. Judging by the photos, it looks like everyone but the wedding party left and then they obviously staged a lot of \"drunken party\" style pics to make it look like they had a good time after everyone left. They didn't.",

Our extended family is generally pretty tight knit, and normally all the relatives get invited to family members‚Äô weddings, but this cousin couldn‚Äôt stand the idea of a big weddings so she kept the wedding really small. Against her parent‚Äôs wishes she got her small wedding and ended up inviting only the relatives she was really close to (hence ‚Äúit was supposed to be‚Äù).\n\nOne of the guests was an aunt of ours, we‚Äôll call her Aunt Susan. When I was growing up Aunt Susan was really nice to cousin Betty. She really treated Cousin Betty well, and in exchange Cousin Betty absolutely adored her. The two were really close, and even when recounting this wedding story, Cousin Betty still remembered younger Aunt Susan fondly. I don‚Äôt know all the details of her life story, but at some point Aunt Susan married rich, quit her job, had kids, and when she realized she was trapped in a life she didn‚Äôt want she turned to alcohol.\n\nBy the time Cousin Betty was getting married, Aunt Susan had been a severe alcoholic for years. At one point she stole her husband‚Äôs sports car, crashed it in a DUI incident, and served time for her repeated offenses, and still turned back to the bottle when she got out. Cousin Betty was kind of nervous about inviting Aunt Susan, but she also really loved her. Aunt Susan‚Äôs parents and sister were also really big parts of Cousin Betty‚Äôs childhood and she invited all 4 members of their family to be there for the big day.\n\nAunt Susan had promised to lay off the alcohol for the wedding, but the morning of the ceremony she did the  exact opposite and got absolutely wasted. She made a huge scene in the lobby of the hotel that the wedding party was staying at and the staff had to kick her out. Under the stress of wedding day Cousin Betty decided it was best Aunt Susan didn‚Äôt attend the ceremony. Aunt Susan didn‚Äôt take that well. She started arguing with Cousin Betty and it escalated. Eventually it got to the point that everyone decided it was better for Aunt Susan to go home, not even to just stay in her room at the hotel, but fly home immediately. \n\nAs the ceremony was supposed to start Aunt Susan was driven to the airport by Aunt Susan‚Äôs sister. On the way Aunt Susan got really belligerent. At the airport she was drunk to the point that they refused to let her on the plane, and her sister had to call the wedding party for help. At this point the ceremony had been interrupted with news about what was going on. After a bit of discussion Aunt Susan‚Äôs sister ultimately took it upon herself to drive Aunt Susan all the way home (a multi-day road trip) to save the rest of the wedding.\n\nThe rest of the ceremony went smoothly, but with the party down two guests (of a very small party to start with), and with the morning‚Äôs events hanging over the rest of the ceremony, Cousin Betty never recalls her wedding with fondness.",

While the 20 something person brawl was spilling out across the reception, the bride grabbed the DJ's mic and started yelling incoherently.  The speakers were more than loud enough to be heard over the fight, but I guess between being pretty drunk and being so upset, the bride literally couldn't form words properly.  My girlfriend and I followed the example of other guests and left before we got swept up into brawl.",

It's essentially just a free meal for the couples that allows them to see how the staff handle a busy event and allows the Executive Chef/FoH management to meet the couples etc. \n\nI was working in the bar that evening, not in the restaurant but I get a call from the restaurant manager to come down. When I get down there the manager points out one particularly drunk groom-to-be and tells me his fianc√©e is waiting at the front door and to get him out. The guy had been abusing the free cocktails all night (stuff like his fianc√©e wasn't drinking so he'd still order two and drink hers). \n\nI go over and try talking to the guy. He starts getting aggressive with me and in general is just making a scene at this point. Eventually manage to get him to leave without having to physically strong-arm him. Bring him up to his very visibly pissed off fianc√©e who drags him out the door and gives him an earful all the way down the car park. \n\nThat was the only wedding I wasn't scheduled to work that year. \n\n2) Wedding goes off without a hitch, reception goes off without a hitch, and everything seems grand. I'm working in the residents bar (as an explanation - in Ireland the bars at the reception usually close at about 1.30. Most hotels have a residents bar for people staying in the hotel, ours would stay up until 4.00) and realise the bride and groom are there. Normally at that stage the couple, and the vast majority of guests, have disappeared but not this couple. Getting on to about 03.30 in the morning and the bride and groom are desperately trying to convince the last few guests not to go to bed. They can barely stand at this stage but they really don't want the party to end (ignoring the fact that the \"party\" was them slumped in hotel lobby arm chairs listening to generic hotel lobby music). They sat there just the two of them until about 4am. \n\n3) Same as above, wedding and reception goes off without a hitch. Bride and her family are pretty much the only ones to make it to the residents bar. They're all locked at this stage but are enjoying themselves. At around 3am the groom shows up to bring the bride to bed. They proceed to have a whisper fight that everyone can hear all the way across the lobby and into the lift. The breakfast told me that the next morning she looked like death warmed up and he was clearly still pissed off about the whole thing. \n\nWith the experience of working countless weddings, my advice for all brides and grooms on their big day is: \n\nEveryone will want to buy you a drink, your best course of action is to have a bad memory and keep forgetting where you set down your drink.",

Second set we announced the dance for the bride and groom, then for the parents. Someone came up and told us that one of the parental couples didn't believe in dancing! Could have used that information earlier....and why hire a band? With all the food gone, guests had no reason to stay, and everyone left. Had some trouble convincing the host that they still had to pay us for the entire amount even though it ended early. Went back to our room and ate snacks from the vending machine.",

Like, don‚Äôt go there if you don‚Äôt know somebody there Texas. I rent a truck and drive 2 hours from Dallas. I get to the wedding and it‚Äôs in a ‚Äúcommunity center‚Äù. Well this community center is  basically a shack attached to a gas station. Behind this gas station is a big metal scrap pile with a big dog on a chain guarding it. \n\nSo I get there and I find out that the brides family doesn‚Äôt want the wedding to happen. Why? Because her in laws are creepy Christians, think creepy cult-like, and they don‚Äôt think the family treats her well. They think her in laws are using her for money and brainwashed her. \n\nOk so whatever the wedding happens. During the ceremony the bride‚Äôs uncle says ‚Äúfuck this‚Äù loudly and walks away from the wedding. Ok that was uncalled for but let me tell you I totally agree with him. \n\nSo the very second that the priest guy dismissed the wedding party and completes the wedding the groomsmen walk the bridesmaids back down the aisle. When they get there they wait for the groom to get there with him. When he does all the men take off after said uncle and all 5 of them just fight him. The groom sucker punches him in the back of the head and the other 4 dogpile him. \n\nMind you this is a tiny, frail old man who got sucker punched. \n\nSo the brides family is like ‚Äúfuck that shit‚Äù and then the whole two sets of families start literally fighting while the bride is sitting in her truck sobbing. \n\nI go talk to the bride. I offer to buy her a plane ticket to leave with me. I offer to drive her around and get away for a bit. THEN HER HUSBAND COMES IVER TO ME AND TELLS ME THAT HIS WIFE AND I DONT HAVE PERMISSION TO TALK TO HER. \n\nSo I get in it with him. I told him I was recording the whole thing and that I have proof that he and his boys sucker punched an old man and that if he lays a damned finger on me or her that I will put him face down on the ground in order to keep my friend safe. \n\nTHEN MY FRIEND YELLS AT ME FOR DEFENDING HER!!  she starts saying really creepy stuff like how he‚Äôs her husband and she MUST obey him or she is disobeying god. \n\n\nSave to say I got the fuck outta dodge and I cannot abide anything to do with Texas after that.

The mom legit had a mental breakdown and began trying to force the guest to go out in the storm, instead of move into one of the amazing ballrooms, as it was going to pass any minute.

Everything was spinning, i think I threw up, I couldn‚Äôt walk, and I couldn‚Äôt organize my thoughts enough to speak (I was six). So the reception turned from a nice dinner to my poor family panicking about this collapsing six year old, and I had to be rushed out for extreme dehydration and some kind of heat related illness.

My wife shoots me a text saying they are running late so I sneak out to go smoke and see the limo kind of hiding in the back. Weird. I guess the bride and her mom decided to smoke a blunt before the ceremony and now she‚Äôs having a panic attack. \n\nFast forward to watching bride cry the entire time, no big deal pretty normal routine. They then leave the venue to go do pictures while everyone moves next door where we had drinks and appetizers. I end up meeting the brothers of the best man and start talking with them, cool people and they invite me to their table since the third sibling couldn‚Äôt make it. No big deal right?\n\nNow the bridal party is back, very late again, but whatever it‚Äôs free alcohol and I‚Äôm social. At this point I‚Äôve become friends with almost the entire party that was under 35, so I was table hopping and making jokes and ended up back at best mans family‚Äôs table. The bride and I had one interaction all night and I‚Äôm not a main character by any means in this story but she does her little entrance dance and immediately stops as she passes us to tell me I‚Äôm at the wrong table. I‚Äôm like 6 jack and coke deep and just laugh and say this seat is empty and I was asked to sit here. She was annoyed as she wanted me sitting with people my age but they were very boring. Food immediately comes out when they sit down which is cool since I was hungry. \n\nOnce we finished eating the bride and groom were nowhere to be found for 3 hours. Now I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre thinking they went to ‚Äúseal the deal‚Äù but no. Mom and Bride smoked another blunt and bride was sitting in the bridal suite in the dark with a priest? (brides aunt), groom, and mom reciting prayers to wish the anxiety away. I hear this from my wife and go, ‚ÄúDamn, I‚Äôd be pissed if I was ‚Äúgrooms parents‚Äù for paying for this.‚Äù My wife looks at me horrified as I was standing right next to his dad. Whoops but at least I reaffirmed his feelings as he did not look happy. \n\n3 hours later, most of the people are gone, my wife goes to grab her stuff to leave and the groom won‚Äôt let anyone into the suite because she‚Äôs still having a panic attack. My wife tells them give her her stuff so she can leave and that‚Äôs when they realize everyone is leaving. They immediately come out do the cake thing, the garder dance, and leave with about 20% of the party there to see it. The rest of the party moved a few miles down the road to a bar where we all talked about how weird it was going to a wedding but not seeing the bride and groom. \n\nTLDR: Bride and mom couldn‚Äôt stop smoking blunts even though it was giving bride panic attacks. Bride and groom miss their entire wedding party due to these panic attacks and sat in a dark room as brides aunt recites prayers over her to remove the anxiety for the entire duration of the party.",

We had suspected groom had issues with alcohol before but had not seen anything like this, guy got plastered (expected). But then started getting really beligerent. Was warned multiple times he was going to get thrown out of the strippers if he kept up his attitude. Eventually we all got kicked out of strippers and bouncers advised us to get him out or they would throw him out and it wouldnt be pretty.. We started getting him out of the place but he would have none of it. He starts throwing punches with us now, screaming at the top of his lungs. It was like someone flipped a switch and now he is on insane mode. Rest of the groomsmen are trying to break it up. People try to calm him for another fifteen minutes but he's not having it. The Best man , who also had a crazy temper , could fight like Jean Claude Van Damme and was half in the bag from drinks the two of them end up in a full brawl in the parking lot.  We had to pay extra for some reason for the limo to come get us early, we think things are settled down so we pile into the limo. Fight starts up again, and we all get kicked out of the limo and left on the side of the road in the middle of no where.  Groomsman is now going full on bezerk, like alcoholic rage, trying to fight everyone, throwing anything he can get his hands on. The rest of us are trying to keep the best man and groom from killing each other. Ive never seen anything like it, its honestly like he turned into an animal. Was completely insane, almost foaming at the mouth.  Eventually he got knocked out.  Wedding day comes and he's up there by himself with no wedding party and wearing aviators because he has two black eyes. None of us have really talked to him since, even his best man.",

She was told told get ready on her own by the bride I guess it was so bad and made her cty at like 8am. So soon comes time for people to arrive.

Immediately she would respond with well this is the worst day of my life.. and then begins to shit talk his wife and how she isn't good enough anf how this was suppose to be here special day and that it's ruined... mind you she's yelling this at me and my best friend very loud and crying in the middle of all the seats.. so everyone on the bride and grooms side hears her.. she didn't stop at all either the whole night too. Ill never forget seeing her yelling this is my special day and telling everyone in the seats looming at her to fuck off. It was like some shit out of a movie. Made the bride cry about 3 times, thankfully people didn't tell her everything till very late so she wasn't completely pissed off during some of it... the worst part of the entire night was I waited for about 45 mins In a massive line for food for it to be ruined.

Was cool and had alot of options, But I waited all that time to get a stacked plate just for that bitch ti walk up and talk the salt shaker near by and dump the while thing on my food.

Towards the end of the reception I went to the bathroom with my sister, which was towards the back of the big ballroom. When we came out we felt the venue had pretty much been deserted. We panicked thinking we took too long and everyone left without us but then realized there was a commotion at the front. \n\nSo apparently the bride and her younger sister had a lot of mutual friends from college etc, including the bride's ex. She didn't want him to be invited to the wedding but the sister went ahead and invited him anyway. The bride noticed him in the crowd and thought that he had showed up uninvited, intending to cause trouble and asked the groom's brother to ask him to leave. When the guy did what she asked the younger sister got super mad and started yelling at him to back off. The groom's brother not having any clue why he was being told off, snapped and a heated argument ensued. Other older cousins from my family showed up to back up the younger sister, assuming the groom's brother was being an asshole. The sis was tiny little girl and at one point she was _standing on a chair_ yelling at the groom's brother.\n\nThe groom saw all the commotion from the tiny stage in the front and got mad at his brother being caught up in the middle for no reason. He got up angrily from the stage where there was a whole army of photographers shooting everything and took off his traditional headgear and stomped on it in rage (which is an absolute sign of disrespect culturally). By that time some family elders had shown up trying to get everyone to calm down as well. So the groom storms off the stage towards this now growing mass of people in the center of the venue, and the bride tries to stop him. She got up from her seat and tried to call out to her husband repeatedly to not leave her side, took a few steps forward, and just fainted on the spot. It was utter chaos for a while until everything settled down and a lot of people left huffed.\n\nNeedless to say the younger sister didn't show up to the big wedding blowout the next day and their mom still tried to save face by going around telling people that she had fallen sick or something. The funniest thing was that during most of the commotion, my dad sat in the back talking to the one guy he really knew there (wedding was in my mom's side of the family) and when the whole thing was getting heated up in the center he just assumed that all the arm flinging and aggressive movement was just people dancing excitedly and continued to chat away since he's not much of a dancer himself. He even pointed an uncle out to me saying, 'Oh, look! I never knew your Uncle X could dance like that!' üòÖ",

Reception was going fantastic until the best mans father had a heart attack and passed away on the ambulance ride to the hospital. Groom pounding drinks with the rest of us while the bride is trying to get everyone to keep dancing and having fun.  I don't blame either of them, but the reception cleared out in about 30 minutes after. I stayed an extra hour to try and keep it going, but by then only family and wedding party were left. \n\nSecond one: Trashy couple that the wife works with got married in BFE in a large church. Brides side only had 10 people on it, 8 friends, Mother of the bride, and some other family member. Groom side is completely packed (Not sure why they didn't just combine, but whatever). Bride walks down the isle to Linkin Parks' \"In the End\", My wife and I look at each other like WTFFFFF. Ceremony was about 8 minutes long so I enjoyed that. \n\nDrove to the reception, fairly normal before the wedding party arrived. Everything was going pretty well, DJ was two elderly men who didn't understand transitions so every new song was a cut and a loud start-up. But besides that ok... Until the Ex-boyfriends family showed up. These people are the Kings of the trailer trash is the best way to describe them.\n\nSome Backstory; The bride was dating a physically abusive guy for years until she finally got the will to break it off and cut him out (Yay!). Well he killed himself not too long after and the guys family blames her 100%. \n\nMoving on! They decided to crash the wedding and shit hits the fan quick. These people show up in \"cowboy\" apparel, Cowboy boots, jeans, cowboy hats, Bolo ties, now this is a large city / casino in Iowa so a bit odd. Well the old man of the group tells the ring-bearer that he's gonna kill him while making a handgun gesture to the kids head.  Oh, and all the men of this trash fest were open carrying handguns / revolvers. Once we heard this we bounced because I don't want to die. Well on our way out we saw 5 squad cars passing us on the little bridge to get to the casino. \n\nFinal note that we found out later. The new groom has multiple Swastika / White power tattoos.

She does that half crouch thing that makes you lean in like it‚Äôs time for secrets. Boy fucking HOWDY was it ever. She proceeded to inform us that the groom had just, in the last hour or two, come to the bride and confessed he had been cheating on her for months. Like, having an affair. Not a one and done thing. He had a GIRLFRIEND outside of the engagement. I repeat - this mother fucker waited until t minus one god damn second, after hair and makeup, while in his fucking tux, to have a moral revelation and tell his wife to be he had been hittin shit on the side, for months. However, he has promised to stop, and it‚Äôs all over. \n\nThe bride forgave him, and decided to proceed. \n\nWe weren‚Äôt there to judge anyone, and if the party‚Äôs still on, we are committed to performing. Once our, shall we say, ‚Äúinformant‚Äù took their leave of us, we had to have a laugh/collective ‚ÄúWTF‚Äù moment. We could not for the life of us figure out why the FUCK she told us.

I‚Äôm sure the person telling us was doing it with the best of intentions. \n\nCut to the reception - it‚Äôs AWKWARD. Holy shit. We basically had a dance floor divided in two groups. It was like that Christmas in the trenches you read about in history books - we had two sides that were NOT about to give in, but, hey. Let‚Äôs socialize a little. But there was just this‚Ä¶ vibe. It was dark. People who weren‚Äôt in the know (or maybe didn‚Äôt care?) sure danced their butts off. Every now and then the respective wedding parties would have a little fun, but would always retreat, cautiously, to find solace (the open bar or ladies‚Äô room). \n\nThe night, for us, ended without much of a fanfare. Honestly the best part was the notoriously difficult venue didn‚Äôt give us too much of a hard time. \n\nTo the bride, wherever you are: You seemed like a very lovely person.

My group of friends would drink at either the one bar we went to, or gather at different people's houses every weekend to drink and chill. We were pretty close knit. A few weeks before one of the girls wedding, and old acquaintance started coming back around, but she was bad off on the drinking. It was honestly so sad to see, we all offered help. She constantly refused, saying she was fine. The night before the wedding we had a chill girls night, a few drinks but not alot. Well this acquaintance shows up invited,  filthy, and hammered. We were trying to get her to shower, but she would go turn on the water, and then sneak into the kitchen to steal beer. She was caught,  and told that the beer belonged to other people and she needed to ask if she could have some, but only after a shower (she seriously stunk). She then pretends to take a shower, by running the shower, but dipping her head into the sink just to look wet. The bride to be walked in on this, and made the decision that she could not come to the wedding. The bride and groom's families did not drink. It was an alcohol free wedding. The drunk girl gets upset and leaves.  We all stay there,  doing all the girly things,  really enjoying the celebration. The next day no one hears from the drunk girl so we think everything is ok.  We get to the venue, this beautiful house out in the country.  Everyone is prepping, getting ready, all in all it was a wonderful day. Until 5 mins before the ceremony (so bride and groom are locked away) a car pulls up,  drunk girl gets out,  stumbling, and the car drives away (this is before uber) she stumbles her way down the long driveway. We try to run interference, but she's not having it,  starting to get loud, causing a small scene. We give up,  tell her to sit in the back and please be quiet. It worked at first,  but right as the bride is going to say her vows, old drunk girl cracks a beer, she knew it was an alcohol free event,  so she brought beers in her purse. Everyone stops and looks back her, she laughs, holds up the beer like a cheers and chugs it. The bride is mortified, the family is visibly upset,  but they push on.  The ceremony finished and then we hear another crack. At this point the bride's sister is furious,  she confronts the girl,  telling her she knew she was not invited,  and knew we weren't drinking, telling her she had to leave now.  Ole girl starts crying,  mumbling about just wanting to be there for the bride, etc. The sisters is informs her that she embarrassed the bride and herself, and now it's time to go. The girl is insisting that she can't leave because she doesn't have a ride. Sister calls the girls family to come get her, that she's causing a scene. This really upsets the drunk girl, she throws her beercan, and then gets another one out of her purse. At this point we are kind of herding her away from the crowd and back to the gate where her sister is going to pick her up.  She's so drunk that she falls. She was wearing a tiny jean skirt and when she fell she showed she wasn't wearing underwear to the entire party. She did this 2 more times. Finally the family/party was moved inside and we stayed with the girl to make sure she didn't try to sneak back in. After 30 mins the sister shows up,  takes the girl,  and we headed inside.  Jesus christ was it tense in there. Everyone was upset,  no one really felt like celebrating after watching that scene. I felt so terrible for the Bride, her day was ruined, but also the girl. She clearly needed help, but just kept on refusing. I made the decision to cut ties with her at this point, as did quiet a few others.  She would occasionally show up at the bar, but no one would even attempt to talk. A few weeks later I heard she was in treatment. Unfortunately I no longer speak to any of those people anymore so I'm not sure if it worked out for her or not.",

I sent in my RSVP that I was going and bought a gift for the couple from the registry to be delivered the day of, to the brides house. I was not close with the bride but we had worked together at a mutual job for a few years. Her fiance was one of my 4 roommates in a big house, and although we were not close either, I guess by proximity I just found myself in this situation where under any other circumstances I don't think there would have been as much of a social obligation to go. I was closer with the other roommates and they all wanted to go together and have a grand time. ANYWAY. My sister who was already engaged decided to have a destination bachelorette party with just my immediate family, so it would be weird to not go. The flight was only 2 hours away.  As timing would have it, the bridezilla's bridal party falls on the same day as the return flight of my sisters bachelorette party. All was going well, the trip with my family went smooth,  and we had an unforgettable time that I wouldn't trade for anything because it was the last big trip with my grandmother before she died. If all went according to plan I would have boarded the return flight, landed, and had plenty of time to get to my house, shower, get ready and get to the bridal party. We get on the plane on time early in the morning, but it doesn't move. We hear multiple flight attendants call for anyone with medical experience to come to the front of the plane, but I didn't notice anyone able to help. A lot of time passes and we have not moved an inch on the tarmac. It turned out a passenger on the plane had a heart attack and needed medical assistance. I don't know the outcome of his situation but what I do know is I spent 4 hours sitting in my plane seat watching the time tick by, thinking in my head, ok I will only have an hour to get ready but that's ok because I can shower quick and just curl my hair...more time passes, ok I will have to just get dressed and go, no time for hair or shower....Ok I will have to go straight from the airport in what I have on....Ok I've missed it completely and hope they received the gift before the party so they see I had good intentions. Well by the time I get to my house EIGHT hours after originally planned I was met by the bridezilla waiting at my bedroom door. While still dragging my luggage up the stairs she let me have it \"HOW COULD YOU LET MY MOTHER PAY FOR A MEAL YOU DIDN'T PLAN ON EATING?!?! SHE IS SO ANGRY, YOU RUINED THE WHOLE DAY, DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT COMING TO THE WEDDING!!!!\" she stormed off and I couldn't say a word. I will never forget how all of my roommates treated me as if i were a criminal out to ruin the wedding, when all that happened was a man on my plane had a medical emergency and this was outside of my control. They wouldn't hear me out, or speak to me for days, and mind you at the time I considered one of the roommates to be my closest friend. I said nothing, planned on not going to the wedding. I eventually was able to explain to my roommate - the future husband, what had happened, and I did receive a thank you for the gift, but he still said \\[Bride\\] is too upset with you, I would stay away from her. She eventually called me after weeks of everyone shunning me and said she had time to think and see's how it was not intentional for me to miss her shower.  Somehow I ended up going to the wedding in the end, and all was fine, but after my roommate who got married moved out, I basically never talked to either of them again, and started distancing my \"closest friend\" because now I could see their true colors. I knew this group of people was a little self absorbed, and talked badly about each other from time to time, but I decided that if I didn't give them a reason to talk about me I could live with it, because they had other redeeming qualities. At that point though, I was done overlooking the red flags, I made sure to add more money in the gift than I normally would have to cover for the meal I never got to eat at the bridal party. It just taught me a valuable few lessons, for one thing, don't rely on travel times, and also if you aren't that close with someone, you can politely decline their wedding invitation especially if your gut tells you to. Lastly if you are feeling unwell before a flight, don't get on the plane, tell someone in the airport what is going on.",

We spent a lot of time there, and created many fond memories. \n\nWhen we decided we would like to marry, we chose that park as our venue. We made all of the plans for the caterers, decorations, invitations, etc. One thing that we hadn't worked out was the wedding photographer. \n\nSo the evening before the wedding, my fiancee and I took her smart car up to the park to meet with the photographer, in order to show her how we wanted certain shots lined up. \n\nBut we didn't make it. As we slowly pulled through a 4 way intersection, a car side swiped us coming from the left. It was a 35 mph zone, and they were doing at least 60. It didn't help that there was actually a 5th road that came in from our left that we had never seen. \n\nI was in the passenger seat and came to with blood in my eyes, a foul smell in my nose, and a pain in my left leg. My fiancee was screaming something horrible as I was just trying to piece together what had happened. I began attempting to assess my own personal damage when I realized that around where my leg hurt it was oddly limp. All I could say was \"Baby, I think my leg is broken\". \n\nThe next thing I remember there is an old man standing over me, wiping the blood off of my forehead and out of my eyes. Turns out I had split my head open and it was gushing blood. Had to have several staples put in for that, but I couldn't even feel it at the time. \n\nSoon after that I was pulled out of the car onto a stetcher and loaded into an ambulance where I'm pumped full of pain killers and my leg is stabilized. I arrive at the hospital where they put the staples in and put me under. \n\nI wake up hours later in the middle of the night and just start bawling my eyes out. A nurse gets angry with me because they can't release me until I'm able to calm down and give them some info. I try to explain to her that I'm crying because I'm worried about my wife and that I ruined our wedding by getting my leg broken. She doesn't care and commands me to sober up. After about 10 min I'm done and she gets me to sign off on some papers. \n\nLater in I'm in a hospital room with a catheter hooked up and an IV in my arm. My wife meets me there and she is shambles. I tell her I still want to get married. She makes a few calls. \n\nThe next day her step-mom has turned the nearby physical therapy room into a wedding venue. It has all of the decorations and food we had wanted, just in a much smaller space. Everyone comes and has a great time. We eat barbecue, we socialize, we all laugh at our weird life. The pastor who officiates our wedding gives a massively innapropriate speech that includes \"Now y'all gotta do what the other one asks of yall. You can't use 'I gotta headache' as an excuse. If they say they're in the mood then the others gotta act accordingly\"\n\nMy wife and I make our promises before kissing to seal the deal. Soon after I'm wheeled back to my room and promptyl pass out for the rest of the day.\n\nNothing ever came of the police case filed with the people that hit us. We weren't on the scene when accounts were taken so they went with the narrative of the people that hit us, which was that we hit them. \n\nI didn't get a cast but a titanium rod, since my leg had been shattered into about 5 different pieces. I was laid up for 6 months after that, and couldn't use my left leg very well until 6 months after that. \n\nI still have flashbacks, my breath still catches during intense situations while driving, like being cut off. My wife still has nightmares, and I can still hear her terrifying screams of agony amd horror. \n\nBut we are together and we are whole again, and if I had to go through it all again just to be with the love of my life, I'd do it happily.",

She got distracted and dropped it, then stepped on it. I took a step forward, unaware, and the entire back of the dress ripped out. My aunt hurriedly sewed it up and we proceeded. \n\nThe next thing to happen was after the ceremony. The photographer took us into the woods and about a million little bugs started swarming me. I ended up with bites all over my face and arms and a whole bunch of black marks on my dress from tiny little bug carcasses. And my earache was getting worse. \n\nAt the reception the chaos continued. My groom‚Äôs cousin got way too drunk. He was hitting on a friend‚Äôs 13 year old daughter. We managed to stop the fistfight. During speeches he drunkenly called his girlfriend and talked to her throughout. Then he joined us on the dance floor during the first dance and twirled around. After that he tried to get into his car and go to Tim Hortons. That caused my father to get upset and a yelling fight broke out between the two families in the parking lot. \n\nI‚Äôve now been mixing Tylenol and champagne for several hours and am not only kinda high, but also nauseous and still in pain. \n\nNow it was time to cut the cake. My mother came to tell me the photographer wanted us to cut the cake right away so they could get pictures. I told her to just have the caterers serve it as my groom was busy arguing with his cousin and much of the wedding party was still in the parking lot. She got angry with me for not doing what I was ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äù and stopped speaking to me for the rest of the night and also the next day. \n\nBy midnight my pain had gotten so intense that I couldn‚Äôt function anymore, so my groom and I left the wedding and went to the hospital emergency.

He said no, and was demoted to usher, which he was fine with.\n\nNext, I went for one session of dress shopping with the bride and her mother, where her mother basically told her it was sinful to stand up before God in a strapless dress. I'm a Christian myself, but I struggled with not saying \"Pretty sure God's seen boobs before.\" Bride was upset both at that, at the lack of options in her size, and at her own weight (don't blame her there - the David's Bridal had mirrors *everywhere*, so it's a tough place if you don't like how you look).\n\nThe bride also picked out ugly floor-length bridesmaid dresses that looked like mother-of-the-bride dresses. She also seemed to not want to pick a color, so in addition to the purple dresses, there were orange and green accessories. One of my best friends was a bridesmaid, and she wasn't happy about wearing all this stuff.\n\nNext, the rehearsal. I was playing piano for this shindig, so I managed to escape most of the drama, but my place in the church balcony allowed an excellent view of the proceedings.\n\nThe bride's father (a pastor) was officiating, so he was taking everyone through the ceremony, but he kept getting distracted because the bride's nephew, who was supposed to be a ring bearer, wandered aimlessly throughout the sanctuary causing a lot of noise. No effort was made to restrain or remove the child (the bride's mother occasionally sat him down next to her, but allowed him to continue to roam freely as he desired), so the explanation of the ceremony was interrupted every two minutes by the bride's father saying, \"Nathan, stop that. Nathan, don't do that.\" This made the whole situation take waaaaay longer than necessary (and we couldn't eat dinner until it was over, so people started to get cranky). The bride also was upset that there were more bridesmaids than groomsmen, and made a snarky comment to my husband about his refusal to get fitted for the suit.\n\nFinally, the wedding. The bride's brother (a groomsman and Nathan's father) arrived nearly an hour late to the ceremony. Nathan, it transpired, refused to be put into a suit, so he was not going to be the ring bearer. (Don't know why they expected a 2-year-old to be able to focus for that long anyway, especially after his behavior at the rehearsal). But, finally, the ceremony started, and everything went smoothly from there.\n\nThey're still married, though I sometimes think (uncharitably) that the bride just wanted any dude so she wouldn't be lonely, since the groom is probably the most awkward and spacey human I've ever met and having a conversation with him is like pulling teeth.",

To this day, my wife's family has resentment towards Germans (no offense to the German readers, but that's how they are).\n\nMy best man, wouldn't you know it, is half German: His (late) grandfather was an American GI who, during the post war occupation, met and married a German woman, who was my best man's grandmother. He is close with all his German relatives and is proud of his German heritage (minus, you know, the whole Nazi thing...)\n\nDuring the speeches, my wife's 90 year old grandmother was severely ill, but she insisted on giving her speech before being taken to the hospital (where she recovered. She lived nine more years actually, dying at 99!). She spoke about how when she got married in The Netherlands, they had nothing \"Because everything had been taken from us by the Germans.\"\n\nMy drunk, half asleep best man, just heard the word \"Germans\" and he yelled out \"YAY GERMANY!!\"\n\nMy wife didn't know how drunk he was and she yelled \"\\[best man\\] shut the fuck up!\" Unfortunately for her, not many people had heard my best man yell out about Germany, but they heard my wife yell at him, so I think a lot of people assumed she was being a bridezilla (which she was not, at any point during the wedding).\n\nMy best man later ate my and my wife's cake when we were making our rounds.\n\nThe rest of the wedding went fine though, and the next morning he called me and asked if he did anything embarrassing because he couldn't remember. He was mortified when I told him.\n\nHowever, it was really of no consequence. No feelings were hurt, my wife's grandmother never heard him yelling, and everybody stayed friends. Now we all laugh about it. Right before my best man's wedding (in which I was a groomsman), I told my wife she should, at some point, yell \"YAY NETHERLANDS!\" at the wedding.

As is customary in India, my parents paid for the whole thing. I wasn't comfortable with them having anything to do with our honeymoon, so I paid for that. Everything else - renting the place, catering, invites for hundreds of guests, multi-day ceremonies, hotel all paid for by my parents from their savings. \n\nWe fly to India with some of her family - not cheap! Our close friends from the US and Canada also flew over at their own expense.\n\nWith a couple of weeks to go, Modi went on TV and announced a nationwide lockdown - effective in 4 hours. lolwut\n\nThat meant no public events. Cops were fining or arresting people simply for stepping out. Heck, even if we could somehow have had the wedding ceremony, the catering, flowers and others wouldn't have made it there. \n\nSome of our friends had plans to fly back to the US right after the wedding. They couldn't get out, since flights had been canceled. Their tickets weren't refunded either.\n\nMy family could not indefinitely pay for hotel stays for our Indian guests from other cities, and they couldn't leave and drive back. Some of them couldn't continue to stay at the hotels and they 'snuck' into my parents' house (snuck in because of the lockdown) and stayed there for many days. We took to sleeping on mattresses on the floor so that our guests could sleep in comfort. \n\nBack then, the loss of money was heartbreaking. Thankfully my family is well-off, but it was still an enormous expense. We felt especially bad for friends and family who had flown across the world for this. Some were stepping outside N. America for the first time and couldn't even see some of India despite all the cost and time spent. \n\nLooking back, it's a happy memory because it's made for some very memorable stories. We did have an incredibly modest (and fun) ceremony in my parents' living room, with flowers from their garden, homecooked food and lots of banter. Growing up in India, you learn to take such jolts in your stride and see the humour in it. My wife's family were extremely gracious despite their experience.\n\nWe'll be having a \"proper\" wedding in the future, but it will have to wait for a few years since weddings cost TONS more in America than they do in India, and my parents won't be spending a penny on that one. :) \n\nOn another note - given the sacrifices that Indians made last year - especially since it was so personal for my family - we are incredibly, incredibly angry at how callously restrictions were lifted earlier this year. With all the death and mayhem going on because of the Modi administration's arrogance and hubris ... we feel like all our trials and sacrifices have been for nothing.",

Said salon was a 45 minute drive, with no traffic, from the hotel where we were getting dressed, which was itself a good half hour from the church. On such a tight schedule the only food we were allowed before the wedding was bagels and coffee. No fruit, no protein of any kind. \n\nDid I mention one of the other bridesmaids was diabetic? The poor girl held on through the ceremony but on the way to the reception site (another roughly 30 minute drive) we had to stop at a gas station for her to get a snack and some juice, and she ended up throwing up in the restroom. By this point everyone else is lightheaded from hunger, not to mention from wearing heavy satin ballgowns in 90 degree heat and high humidity. \n\nWhen we get to the reception everyone else is already there, appetizers are already being served, but the wedding party is ushered away because we have to take pictures immediately. It was close to an hour before someone finally sent a couple of caterers with trays of mini quiches and stuffed mushrooms out to us, at which point we all swarmed them, ignoring my sister's whining about how we weren't done with pictures yet, which eventually progressed to a full blown tantrum. Ten years on, she still occasionally brings up how we all messed up her day by not wanting to pass out from hunger and the one bridesmaid threw everything off schedule by, y'know, almost going into diabetic shock.",

I've told this story on Reddit before, this is a copy paste job.\n\nI work as an events rigger, which means I do the overhead installation on gigs.  On a wedding this is usually installing supporting structure for floral, chandeliers, ceiling drapes etc.  For a surly old bastard who started on rock and roll gigs, I've developed a decent eye for wedding decor.\n\nSo usually before I can bring anything down from overhead, I've got to wait for guests to leave, and usually everything on the ground to clear.  Often the dance floor has to be pulled up before I can drive a scissor lift in.\n\nSo this particular gig is a big money show, it's a 5 star hotel with a huge amount of set, and floral and glass on the floor, huge multi tiered set for the bridal table and they've had a custom white print done across the dance floor with the bride and groom's names in gold.  I've got chandeliers and floral in the roof to bring down.\n\nSo I get to work and there's wedding guests still mingling, but there's no music, ugly lights on and the only two people on the dance floor are uniformed police taping off the area.  They're preserving the crimescene til the detectives get here, so no chance of loading any of my gear out from above.  All I hear is that there's been a stabbing.\n\nI'm looking at the custom dance floor with the couple's names on it.  There's blood on the white tiles.  The blue and white tape seems so intrusive.  No one will forget this day, and for all the wrong reasons.  The couple's names are preserved in forensic photos now.\n\nWho the fuck goes to a family event tooled up, and why does anyone think it's the place to stab a cousin.\n\nI went home and still got paid.

            "text": "Way late to the party but gotta add this wonderful example of redneck glory from June 1998.\n\nBride was one one of those Keeping Up With The Joneses types, saw herself as a real life Princess that deserves everything handed to her on silver platter. She's drop dead gorgeous and knows it. If you didn't know her family history, you'd think she was born into old money. But she grew up in a trailer park, parents are 2nd cousins but due to rampant infidelity her real father might be her dad's brother, or maybe even her dad's estranged father who is 1st cousins with groom's mother. She has 7 siblings, and all but one of their paternity is in question as well. Groom's family is much the same but he only has 5 siblings, all brothers, but the groom is smart as a whip and very business savvy so he escaped the poverty via education and hard work in finance and took the bride along for the ride despite her never working a day in her life. \n\nThe wedding was a $50k affair, the bride's ring was a $20k stunner, and she was already upset because the groom, who was paying for the entire wedding, was being cheap. The rather large guest list included their \"new life\" social circle, groom's college social circle, groom's business associates and clients, and both bride & groom parents which was the end of family members on the guest list. Some 300 guests and only 4 of them family members, and the wedding was an hour drive from the town where they both grew up.\n\nA whole 10 minutes into the ceremony, a huge police task force raids the wedding to serve a little over a dozen outstanding arrest warrants of family members but the big bust was a big bust because the bride & groom intentionally left their extended families off the guest list but the local and state police had anticipated that extended family being invited and in attendance. Really embarrassing but ultimately a fairly short interruption all things considered. Wedding proceeds and if not for the wise decision to exclude siblings and extended family the wedding would have been an unmitigated multi-front disaster. Good thing a large group of trailer trash rednecks, many of whom are career criminals with zero respect for the law aren't at all offended by the exclusion and will totally honor bride & groom's wishes for them to not be there on Princess's special big day...\n\nAn hour into the open bar reception the party had slowly grown in size by nearly 100 people who very much seemed out of place. Dressed in everything from tacky thrift store suits & dresses to camo pants & cut off sleeveless camo shirts to biker leathers and everything in between, the new arrivals that trickled in were quite loud and obnoxious. This was the crowd the police had been expecting at the wedding, and it was now very obvious to the invited guests why the police had shown up. I suspect the police were first called the moment the Best Man's unconscious body hit the floor and another groomsman was thrown onto the chocolate fountain, but it took a solid 10 minutes before the first cop showed up and another 5 before that original task force made an appearance. By then the reception had turned into a Hollywood-style bar brawl, mostly the bride and groom's family fighting -- each other. By the time the police task force had shown up most of the invited guests had bailed as that kind of thing was just not in their wheelhouse.\n\nThe cops had a hell of a time ending the chaos but they did get 9 of their targets, one of whom was wanted for murder though he *was* later found innocent. All in all some 25 people were arrested, about 10 of them women, and there has $15k in damages to the building including broken windows and a small fire.\n\nSource: Was the +1 of a bridesmaid. She ended up with a split lip and had one of the punch bowls dumped on her and the bride. Last I heard, the bride & groom were still happily married at their 20th anniversary a few years ago. They have a single child, a well adjusted daughter born a couple years after the wedding.",

Outdoor lake house wedding, ceremony was cool for the most part except the groom forgot to bring suits for the 2 boys who were both ring bearers. The lake house was an hour and a half away from where everyone lived so everything was delayed.  The reception though...holy hell. The catering was shit and DJ was a dude with an aux cord and a speaker. We are all still having a good time trying to stay positive for our friends sake. Then bride & groom get up to cut the cake. People are standing around taking pictures, and someone from the grooms family yells \"shove it in her face\". I watched the groom look at his wife then down at the cake in his hand, and he proceeds to smear the cake in the brides face/hair. Instantly the bride snaps. She starts screaming/berating him in front of everyone, starts bawling, and runs off into the lake house. The bridesmaids go to help her clean up, but everyone else is left awkwardly standing in silence. After a few min of letting the bride cool down the groom goes to check on her. More berating ensues and the bride says shes not coming back out. So for almost TWO HOURS everyone attending the wedding just stood around. People start leaving thinking bride isn't coming back. Eventually the DJ says he is going to leave too, but asks if the couple want to do their \"first dance\". The bridesmaids eventually convince the bride to come back out, and with less than half the amount of guests left, the couple dances...quite angrily lol. The couple went to bed after that while we drank all the alcohol and talked about WTF just happened.",

I am a wedding planner so I love weddings and have have had mine planned since I was about 10 and I'm Greek so what can I say, lol, I wanted a wedding. I am also super close with my family while he has some strained relationships and was ultimately raised by his grandparents, but we worked through the guest list and were both really excited. His grandfather hadn't been out much, his life consisted of sitting on the couch watching fox news for 12 hours, only getting up to pee, not even to get his own food. He was in poor health from years of smoking and several heart attacks but he was very eager to attend. They showed up, he was all smiles, looking dapper af, with more life in him than we had all seen in years. Everyone was commenting how he hadn't smiled so much in forever and that this was so special for him and his wife. Well, after the ceremony we rolled him in his wheelchair up to the reception and bounced off for cocktail hour and to line up for introductions. While we were waiting to be announced his cousin came running in saying there was something wrong with his grandfather. We rush in and we have a group of around 8 guests taking turns doing CPR waiting for medics. Turns out he had a heart attack and just keeled over.  We were close to a hospital so it didn't take long but it felt like an eternity. All the guests were ushered back into the cocktail room so our certified guests could keep doing CPR. When the medics showed up and didn't defibrillate him (you know when the machine advises \"no shock\"), we knew he was dead already. So his grandmother and a couple other members of his family left to go to the hospital and I asked my husband what he wanted. He said, \"well he is already gone, there is nothing we can do at this point. Let's party for Pap.\" So that's what we did. We got together and made a speech, my dad took over as MC to keep things positive while also acknowledging what just happened, and the whole group just partied for Pap. It turned into such a beautiful celebration full of love and human connection. That day was full of every human emotion possible and everyone who was there shared something special that day. People still tell me it was one of the best weddings they ever attended. Looking back on it now neither one of us looks back on it with sadness.

A sudden blizzard popped up and completely shut down the airport and the roads to where the hotel and the Church were. The priest, Catholic, refused to be picked up and brought to the hotel where maybe thirty or forty of us were staying because Catholics get married in a church. So the other groomsmen and I drove out about an hour early, half an hour away that took us over an hour, shoveled out the pathway to the church front door. Nobody that was flying in on the day of and nobody that was driving from the local area was able to make it.

The only people dressed for a wedding were the other groomsmen and me, to bridesmaid plus the bride and groom. Everyone else was literally in jeans and boots. We made the best of their reception, the DJ showed up and a few of us that made it had a great time. The next day we had to get special permission from the state police to get on the highway to get back to the airport.

She threatened to call the cops on him because according to her he was being violent even though she started everything. I must have said something she didn't like at some point because before she would let him come back to the hotel they were staying at she made him tell me, while on the phone with her, to \"quote\" - stay out of their relationship. \n\nAfter that night I pretty much stopped talking to my dad.

I realize at this point I am seriously overdressed. \n\nThe wedding is set to begin. Do we head into the visitors centre? No. We are lead down a dirt road into a gully in the middle of the forest. Apparently they had sent a memo to not wear heels. I did not get the memo. \n\nIt was July or early August in Ontario, so it was approximately 35 degrees with the humidex so I'm sweating my ass off in this fancy dress, and my hair decides it's had enough and goes rogue into a giant sweaty pouffball. The ceremony begins and I'm literally leaning up against a tree. The officiant is completely drowned out by the sound of not-so-distant dirtbikes. \n\nAfter the ceremony we all head back to the visitors centre for dinner. There is one bathroom, complete with composting toilet, so we're all jockeying to get in to pee and fix ourselves up. It's very quickly destroyed. \n\nWe go up to the bar to get some pre-dinner drinks. We were told it was a twoonie bar, so none of us brought much money, I only brought $20. It was not a twoonie bar and drinks were minimum $5. Boo.\n\nDinner starts, and the MC directs us to the envelopes at each table. Says everyone needs to donate some money for the bride and groom, and the tables that give the most get to eat first. My sad table of misfits looks at each other and we all realize we have no money. I've already spent a quarter of mine on one drink. We all give in some change, maybe a fiver. One enterprising misfit throws in a handful of m&ms. Our table is therefore last to eat. By this point I'm several drinks in and haven't eaten anything. It's not looking too good for me. I get...sloppy. \n\nFinally after the worst ever dinner and the world's longest speeches, it's time to dance! I'm pretty drunk at this point and make a pretty decent √†ss out of myself on the dancefloor in front of the very conservative family. At 10 o'clock the music cuts off and the party's over. Time for bed. Oh did I mention we were all staying over at the visitors centre? They had a bunch of rooms with bunk beds. Yeah. \n\nAnyways, it's still pretty early for a bunch of early-20s misfits, so we and our friends all go to one of the rooms where we are just chilling, talking, and passing around a bottle of tequila someone smuggled in. Nothing crazy, and we are trying to be quiet and respectful. Around 11pm, the mother of the bride STORMS into the room we're in, yanks the bottle of tequila out of my friend's hand, and starts screaming at all of us that the wedding is over and it's time to go to bed. We're a little like wtf, and it's still not super late, so we decide that maybe we should just go outside to keep hanging out because surely outside we won't be bothering anyone. We don't even have any alcohol at this point (and I did not need more anyways). So we head outside, at which point the mother of the bride calls security on us. The groom comes out and tell us that the bride and her mother are piiiiiissed, and that it's time for bed. The security guard is sympathetic but gently lectures us a bit and then brings us all back in. So we all begrudgingly head back to our rooms for the night. We crawl into our bunkbeds and fall asleep.\n\nThe next morning at like 8 am we are awoken to the groom angrily knocking and sticking his head into the room and telling us to get up because it's time for us to help clean up and then GTFO. There is a breakfast buffet, so my SIL grabs a muffin, at which point the bride yells at her that the food is only for the wedding party and that we'd better start cleaning up right now. We did a couple of chores, then were basically told to leave immediately or else they would have to pay extra for us being there or something.¬† I dunno. At that point we could not leave fast enough.¬† Us and our other friends met up at a truck stop to grab some breakfast for the 3 hour drive home, and we were all just like...what the f√πck was that!?!? \n\nThe best part is now almost 12 years later the groom has never spoken to any of us again. We think its because the bride and her mom were so appalled at our \"after-hours\" drinking and fun-having (revelry, at a wedding of all places!). So basically, we ruined their wedding. \n\nThat wedding will live in infamy amongst our friend group and as the worst wedding any of us have ever been to.",

The venue was a large floor built over a ravine with a roof built around the perimeter of it, and nothing over the middle of it. Looked beautiful with some stringed lights. \n\nThe day of the groom was late by 45 min because he had to pick up his best man from the airport (the best man was too cheap to rent a car on his own). It was hot and humid so were were getting everyone water while they waited. The dining equipment came late as well so I had to employ family members to set it up in the interim...same the catering. When the groom finally arrived, they held the ceremony.\n\nWhen that was over, everyone made it over to the venue where everything was finally set up. We did pictures (my father in law drove three hours to help us out) and people started eating....then it started raining. Since there was no tent, people huddled under the perimeter roof until it stopped. We did the dancing and then...the groom left to take his best man to the airport, leaving my sister. I ended up breaking a toe slipping on the wet dance floor. We stayed with her for two hours eating and dancing until we finally took her back to mom‚Äôs house because everyone else had left. We reamed him out when he arrived at nearly 12am. After that, they left for a hotel. \n\nObviously, the biggest reason why this was ruined is because neither the groom or bride really planned ahead.",

I was 20-21 at the time, and looking forward to the event but my older brother was in a really bad place at the time, he had lost his girlfriend and his job from drinking too much and things had only spiralled downward from there. I didn‚Äôt see him often and when I did he would be drunk alone at our dads where he was staying, or always looking like he had just sobered up from a bender. \n\nIt was a tough time, but I went to the wedding with my little brother (who was 16-17 then), in the hopes of having some fun but also looking forward to seeing our older cousin (i.e the grooms son), who‚Äôs less than two years younger than my at the time alcoholic brother (O.b for short from now). They‚Äôve always been close, and I was hoping that I could get him to come with me and my little brother to pay a visit to my o.b and see if that would help him. \n\nSo what me and my lil bro did was bring this up with our cousin after the wedding itself, when we had gathered at the place where there would be dinner and all that. He agreed, but we had to ask our uncle if it was okay that we left to do this just for a little while. \n\nNow, I know now that it was a big mistake from us to ask this from our uncle, it was his big day and it could have waited. But both me and my little brother were young, and we were so desperate to come up with something that could help big bro, especially since we felt like things had gotten so bad that we could end up losing him if we didn‚Äôt do anything. \n\nSo we asked, and the result was that our uncle yelled at us and told us in so many words how rude and wrong it was of us to ask him this on the day of his wedding. Both me and my brother had expected that this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem since we were so caught up in the situation, so his reaction was very upsetting to us since we at the time felt like he was ignoring the needs of his oldest nephew. We both promptly left the party and felt very bad about the whole thing, there were complex emotions going around to say the least. \n\nThe good part is that big bro went into rehab not that long after, there was a family component there that helped me realise that I had made the wrong decision and I apologised to my uncle, and my big bro cleaned up his act and everything points to that he hasn‚Äôt had a problem with alcohol in like 8 years or so. \n\nI have very little contact with my uncle (and my aunt too, his sister) unfortunately, but that‚Äôs another story.",

Before the dance, the staff cleared most of the marbles that had recoiled, but not all; Some guests during the dance tripped, which sort of had a dominos effect despite the venue being big (idk why people stick so close together). I think like 2 people were injured badly and went home. After that disaster, they stopped the dance, and brought wine to drink before finally ending the \"beautiful\" wedding.

Immediately after they got engaged, the bride‚Äôs sister got engaged. The rumor is that she demanded it from her then boyfriend. The bride‚Äôs father ‚Äúasks‚Äù (demands or he‚Äôll cut funding) that they have a double wedding so he doesn‚Äôt have to pay for two weddings, and so extended family doesn‚Äôt have to travel all that way twice. I don‚Äôt even know where to start.\n\nBride- M\nGroom- T\nBride‚Äôs sister- B\n\nWe walked in, and the church was split in two. If you were there for M and T, you were on the right, if you were there for B you went to the left. Only the bride‚Äôs family was on B‚Äôs side, while the right side was almost completely full. This would later cause issues. Then the bridesmaids came out. Two separate color schemes. B had this awful teal and pink (think cotton candy) theme, while M and T had pretty oranges and fall colors. B wanted a friend to officiate instead of the pastor that M and T wanted. While the friend was officiating the ceremony off of his phone, it dinged. He stopped talking, chuckled, and answered the text. He pronounced M and T first, and we cheered without realizing that they were going to do each couples vows and such and then they would kiss at the same time. B stared daggers into the crowd while we all awkwardly sat through her stuff. \n\nOne of our other family friends is a professional photographer. Like, teaches at multiple colleges professional. B insisted that an aspiring photographer friend take the photos instead. Our friend was desperately trying to give this girl tips so all the photos wouldn‚Äôt be trash, but B was pissed that he would ‚Äúcome in here like he knows anything.‚Äù He quietly asked the orange party to stay behind so he could take some good pictures of them.\n\nThe reception was set up similarly. We were only allowed to sit at tables with orange decorations if we were there for M and T, teal and pink for B. Now this is really where sh** hit the fan. B wanted a ‚Äúclassy‚Äù wedding. T had a friend that was part of a jazz quartet. What‚Äôs classier than that? A white trash DJ with a green mohawk. They would switch off each hour. So everyone that was there for M and T would dance for an hour, then sit down when the DJ came back out. All the food was set up buffet style, so we all went through. M and T wanted a simple taco bar. What‚Äôs classier than that? Lil smokies in BBQ sauce and Mac and cheese. Then B got pissed because M and T‚Äôs guests had eaten their food. That was all on the same table. With no labels. \n\nThe bride‚Äôs father was then caught moving gifts from M and T‚Äôs gift table (that was overflowing) over to B‚Äôs table. When confronted, he said they wouldn‚Äôt miss the presents and B was upset she didn‚Äôt have as much. My parents went off on him about how all these people were here to support M and T, these gifts were thoughtfully picked out for them, it was his own fault his little brat didn‚Äôt have anything, and that from that point on someone would be stationed at the tables to make sure it didn‚Äôt happen again. \n\nWe also have this family tradition where someone will make some homemade warzonka (Polish Whiskey), then you can buy a shot to dance with the bride. The money goes to the couple for a honeymoon fund. The father pulled our cousin (who made the whiskey) aside and let her know that half would be going to B. She said okay, and made eye contact when she put all the money in the basket on M and T‚Äôs table. \n\nEveryone left early because the reception started at 3, and B refused to cut the cake until 7. No one wanted to sit through more of her whining and tantrum throwing. It was literally just one thing after the other, and we were all just about ready to throw her into a lake. \n\nM and T are still happily married and have a beautiful baby girl.

Not anaphylactic, but swollen lips and face, everything. She was quite the mess. Luckily my cousin's mother and bunch of the family are nurses and take care of her. They call an ambulance, but she doesn't get an EpiPen, since they'd have to take her to the hospital. So they hop her up on a ton of Benedryll for a while. Meanwhile, the party is going on and on, everyone is having a great time. Somewhat towards the end of the party, she and my cousin actually come out for their \"first dance\". I didn't notice how bad she was, but I think she left after that. The rest of the party and reception goes off without a hitch (minus 1 or 2 vomitting family).

Two hours of Jimmy Buffett on the radio and off roading in a rental sedan later, we arrive at a picnic site in the middle of cow pastures with a small pavillon and at least 200 people milling about. \n\nIt stinks of manure. There's barely any shade. It's already 85F at 11am. There's *one* portable toilet. We figure, screw it, we'll stay for the ceremony and appetizers then dipset.\n\nWe wait about an hour for the couple to arrive. Everyone is ushered to the cheap foldable chairs in the sun, and the ceremony begins. There's a lengthy sermon. Then there's \"original\" poetry readings by family. Then there's \"original\" religious singing performances. Then there's a 45min \"foot cleansing ceremony\" by the couple, including taking off and re-applying knot-tied sneakers and socks all while the couple takes moments to make out. (Fine, if you want to do the \"Jesus cleaning feet thing\" but wear flipflops and restrain your urges, ffs.) The ceremony *finally* ends, two-ish hours later, and the couple goes off to take photos. \n\nEveryone is dying of heat and thirst by this point. We line up at the pavilion where we're expecting refreshments at the very least. \n\nPopsicles. Not even real fruit frozen on a stick, but those shitty sugar-water filled plastic tubes. That's it. No water, no food, no booze, barely any shade, and it's easily over 95F. \n\nThree hours later, the DJ announces the reception. There's 10-12 picnic tables and 250+ people here. People start claiming seating space in the shade. \n\nThen the DJ says we're doing a \"welcome\" for the couple. Everyone back out into the sun. The wedding party does the normal \"dance into the floor\" lineup, but then the couple does this sex fueled dance entry, and it lasts well over 10 min. The DJ then says that other couples should come out and join them. No takers, but he tries for another 10min or so. \n\nWe left during this. \n\nWe found out later that other family members brought their own snacks, water, and booze, because they guessed correctly that she'd pull this kind of shit. She was marrying an uber-religious Nigerian guy, and they do weddings differently than what we're used to. (I have nothing against other cultures; it just would have been nice to know.)\n\nOther things we found out later:\n\n-The professional catering company only brought food for 50 people. That's what they were told to bring. They did not bring any beverages of any kind except for their staff. Because so much time had passed, the food was deemed unsafe at the holding temperature, and they left without serving anything. \n\n-The rest of the food was provided by the groom's church. All of it was some type of meat/ fish stew that had been sitting in unheated crock pots (or rice that was in flimsy aluminum chafing dishes) since who knows when. At the latest, 9am that morning, since they showed up at 10am. Even if there would have been enough for the guests, I'm sure it would not have been safe to eat. \n\n-People were openly \"relieving themselves\" behind cars because the line for the single toilet was so long.\n\n-Five people were \"treated\" for heat stroke, after some church members left and brought back *water*. Just water. \"God heals all.\"\n\n-The bride's family and friends all left after finding out the food situation. They had been optimistically waiting for 8+hours for some relief and finally just left. I'm convinced they would have been very ill if they stayed.\n\n-The \"festivities\" went well after sunset. Some guests had trouble leaving after dark because the trail of a road wasn't marked and most people drove sedans in. Several tow trucks were called. \n\n-The remaining \"guests\" had to clean up everything because the property rental people strictly enforced taking out every single bit of trash before they left. I still don't know if this included excrement. I imagine they have this rule because it's surrounded by cow pasture and the owner's don't want their cattle eating trash.",

Dinner was hours late and the snacks we wanted served at the cocktail hour were also not ready. But we had a ton of alcohol on tap so people stood around drinking with empty stomachs. \n\nThe venue was new to the wedding business. The venue mentioned I could pay a couple of their cousins to help out the caterer in the kitchen, but it turned out that the helpers were children between the ages of 6-10 so they were no help. The chef finally comes out to cook the shrimp we chose for the cocktail hour and he was cooking it in the tiniest pan one batch at a time, it was like a 6 inch pan. For 100 people. He finally started serving the salads around 9 or 930 like an hour before our venue closed. Turns out the salads were pretty hearty and he had prepared them in advance but for some reason he never served them even though people were starving.\n\nWe skipped the father daughter and the mother son dance and had our first dance on the grass while everyone ate. We then only had 30min-1hr of dancing before we had to leave. We later found out the wedding planner left during all of this because ‚Äúshe was hungry‚Äù so she left us all starving. I didn‚Äôt take charge because I was thinking she was on top of it. I even turned down my father In Laws offer to order pizza because I was thinking the wedding planner probably had it handled. Otherwise I would have accepted help and took charge. We made the best of it and danced our asses off for the small amount of time we had. No one ever got the actual main course but they did deliver it to us the next day and we served it during the brunch. \n\nThe wedding planner didn‚Äôt help me with writing up the seating chart and I wasn‚Äôt able to help write it out in the way she wanted because I was busy with family stuff. So I asked my sister in law to print it out for me and she decided she didn‚Äôt like the seating chart and just never printed it. So we had no seating chart and people were confused about where to sit.\n\nI think the wedding planner was mad at me for not helping her more with the setup.  I thought she was doing all of it and I was overwhelmed because my dad who I hadn‚Äôt seen in 15 yrs showed up in advance and my mom and sister who are estranged from him also were there so I was trying to spend time with everyone.\n\nI am still pretty devastated about it like 4 yrs later.

Gorgeous setting. \n\nWell, a handful of us arrive on Wedding day to set up and find out that the previous wedding from the previous day had not cleaned up. At all. Not even a little bit. They were contractually obligated to do so, but did not.\n\nDecorations, chairs, tables, basically everything you'd expect to find at a wedding ceremony and reception except the food, all still there. \n\nMom of the bride was frantically calling the park service but they weren't answering due to weekend ours I guess? So we basically grabbed trash bags and started filling them with all the shit. Wedding in in two hours and all we'd needed to do was put up our decorations and it wouldn't have taken long with the number of people we had - but now we had to take down someone else's wedding AND clean everything.\n\nHalf an hour later and about 75% of the way done cleaning their shit up, a Tahoe shows up with the father of the bride and some groomsmen, they're asking us what the fuck we're doing, mother of our bride gave him one look and said \"We have a wedding here in an hour and a half\". The guy didn't say anything else and his crew just started gathering up as much as they could and cramming it into the Tahoe, then cleaned whatever was left. They offered to help us set up for the next wedding but we just wanted them to leave.\n\nSo, we get all set up and the wedding is saved. Then the food truck shows up. Then a minute later, the Park Ranger who had FINALLY gotten the voicemails shows up, and tells us we can't have the Food Truck. The Park Ranger on duty when the venue was rented approved the Food Truck, but THIS Park Ranger said NO. \n\nSo, no food for the fucking reception.\n\nWe tried hard to keep all of this information from the Bride but somehow she figured it out and was freaking out. The Groom looked like he'd aged about 100 years through all of this bullshit.\n\nUltimately we sent the food truck to the camp/cabin site we were all staying at (a couple miles down the road) and reassured the bride that it would actually be better to have the reception there, that way everyone can drink as much as they want and can just retreat to their cabins when they've had enough rather than trying to clean up or drive back to the camp ground. \n\nIn the end it worked out, but holy shit, people suck.",

My ex-gf and I showed up to the ceremony late because she took forever to get ready. Turns out that was a blessing because the ceremony was in an old rickety barn that was made up to look rustic cute for weddings. Gaps in the walls, no insulation, etc. It was freezing and windy in there! Thankfully we were only in there for the last 10 min or so of the ceremony before moving into the reception hall.\n\nThe reception hall was not much better. It was a tin sided equipment building set up to now be a reception hall. No insulation or heat in the building. It was as warm as the barn, but had no wind. It was cold AF! The people who own the venue didn't bother to bring in heaters or anything to warm it up until after people were complaining about the cold. Nobody knew to expect this so all of these poor women were in nice dresses and heels freezing their butts off. The guys all gave up their coats and dealt with the cold. The venue owners only had 2 big propane blower style heaters which were not big enough to warm the space so everyone just huddled around the heaters the whole time.\n\nThe groom was a really good college friend, but I had never met his fiance. I didn't feel bad as apparently none of our friends had either. We found this out while we were all catching up. The bride had no friends only family there. We all tried to talk to the bride, but she was a bit shy and did not care to chat with any of the groom's friends for more than 5 min so we eventually gave up trying. The food catered in was like a wedding buffet from Old Country Buffet that got cold quick. Think terrible pasta, fried chicken, etc. The bar was only open bar for like 1 hour or a X dollar limit which none of us knew about so we were surprised to suddenly have to pay for drinks at dinner and going forward. The room was split in half all night with groom's side near one heater and bride's side across the room around the other heater. It was great catching up with friend's, but over all it was the worst wedding I have ever been to. \n\nThe bride and groom are still married and have a kid, but as far as I know none of our friends have seen or talked to him since the wedding.

Unfortunately missed some of the details in the middle, but as table center pieces were being put out right before ceremony, there was some commotion coming from the locker room.  The bride marched in to find her soon to be husband doing some last minute bachelor things with one of the bridesmaids.  As you can imagine, the drama quickly swelled into the wedding being called off.  Lots of radio edited language, the mother of the bride throwing shit, etc.  Best part was seeing the father of the bride (who I believe was paying for most of it) thought it was all pretty funny. I think he already knew his future son in law was a scum bag. He and many of the guests still hung around and enjoyed the reception meal and drinks as it wasn't getting refunded at this point.  Honestly, for us, it was one of the best weddings to work.  No wedding planner breathing down our back, no crucial time lines, cake cutting, toasts, etc.  Out of several hundred weddings I managed, this one will never be forgotten.",

I guess it‚Äôs less expensive to reserve the club for a Friday evening and then ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù over the weekend?\n\nThe place where the ceremony took place is a well-established Baptist settlement in New Mexico. A famous Baptist preacher was to marry the couple, however she was suffering from pneumonia and waited nearly two hours for the wedding party to arrive at the church before she had to leave and go to a local hospital. The entire wedding party including the bride and groom were *over two hours late* for their own ceremony because they had stayed up partying the whole night before. That‚Äôs right. On a Thursday. üôÑ\n\nSince the wedding party was two hours late for the ceremony, most of the guests left before the ‚ÄúI do‚Äùs were ever said. The parents of the bride had guaranteed and paid for 300 guests for a sit down dinner at a local country club. Around 80-100? total guests were at the reception. The cake was delivered from the bakery with a HUGE crack in the top of it and no way to fix it. A stray dog ran onto the dance floor. The cherry on top was that a local bartender had gone missing and then her dismembered remains found scattered around the outskirts of town and the local gang enforcement squad of the city police showed up *AT THE RECEPTION* to arrest one of the servers for their knowledge/involvement of the murder of the local bartender. \n\nDo not get married on Friday the 13th, kids.

Hotel reservations, chapel booked, nail and hair appts, reception dinner reservation, flowers, cake, etc. We handled our clothes, travel and paid for hotel for ourselves. His family refused to attend because it was Memorial Day weekend and they had plans for a family BBQ instead. So our entire guest list was 6., 2 of which were my stepsibs, who were 5 and 3 at the time.\n\nDuring the wedding planning, my stepsib's mother (my stepdad's ex wife) screamed on the phone and said that she would charge him with kidnapping if he took the kids out of state for the wedding unless he paid her an extra $1500 in support.\n\nWe get to Vegas and the hotel refuses to let us check in because we are both under 25. I have to call my mom to come down from her room to switch the room reservation to her name and give her cash to repay her. \n\nWhen we go to the county clerk to get our license, she initially refused to issue it because my ex's legal birth name is technically a nickname (think \"Nick Sid\" on his BC instead of \"Nicholas Sidney\" - not his real name but you get the idea.) Finally, we got that, but it makes me 5 minutes late for my hair and nail appt. Get to the salon, they claim there's no appt and it's a 2 hour wait for service. I step outside to call my mom for help since she made the appt and my purse got stolen with all my ID and travel money in it. My dad went dumpster diving IN HIS USMC dress uniform and didn't find it.\n\nWhile doing my own hair and makeup, I cut my hand open on my \"borrowed\" piece of jewelry for the ceremony (still have the scar on my palm). Got to the chapel and they had lost the info on my prepaid wedding, so I didn't get the upgrades we had paid for (like roses in my bouquet). The photographer that was part of the package was drunk as a skunk and only spoke German - so all my wedding photos are me in tears while I'm being screamed commands in German how to be posed. Of 3 rolls of film, I only got one photo of the whole thing that came out halfway decent.\n\nMy mom told everyone the wrong time for the ceremony, so what few guests we had showed up 45 minutes late - including my parents who were standing up with us and our witnesses. The chapel was threatening to cancel our ceremony and make us rebook as my famly came running up late. My uncle showed up in wrinkled chinos and shirt with dirty old tennies on and refused to take his sunglasses off the whole time, even for photos. My stepsibs fought through the whole ceremony, including kicking each other and screaming in the chapel.\n\nThe vows, which I had specifically told the chaplain were NOT to include the words \"love, honor and obey\" for BOTH of us... were still give to us as \"love, honor and obey.\" I got dirty looks from the chaplain when I said, \"love, honor and cherish\" but w/e.\n\nMy reception dinner - restaurant lost the reservation (are we seeing a trend here?) and apologized by hyping my stepsibs up with free soda until they were vibrating. The wedding cake that was supposed to arrive after dinner... didn't. The restaurant kitchen swore they didn't receive the delivery. Calls to the baker were met with, \"I delivered it to the kitchen myself, what do you want from me?\"\n\nWe went back to my parents' hotel room to chat, and get a call that my cake has been located. The baker had delivered it to the hotel's ROOM SERVICE kitchen instead of the restaurant kitchen. They sent my cake up, but refused us any silver or plates unless we wanted to pay $10 a head for their use. My cake, which was supposed to be a small 2-tier round wedding cake, was a half-sheet cake that looked exactly like a grocery store bakery birthday cake. I cut my wedding cake with the handle of a plastic fork - which my mom had luckily packed disposable tableware in case the hotel refused to provide any.\n\nMy ex shoved cake in my face and up my nose despite our agreement not to do any cake shoving during the \"first bite\". In the process, he pulled one of my earrings out of my ear and nearly tore my earlobe. I ended locked in the bathroom with my mom and aunt while they iced my ear and helped me get frosting out of my ears, nose and eyelashes.  Meanwhile, my ex was thisclose to getting his ass beat in the other room by my stepdad and uncle while my stepsibs were jumping on the bed and trying to shove cake down their gullets before anyone stopped them.\n\nIn all this, we forgot to ice the bottle of champagne that my mom had bought, so my toast was with warm champagne. My uncle threw a fit because I wasn't 21 yet and I told him after the day we'd had, if I wanted a sip of champagne on my wedding day, that was my business. He sulked for the rest of the night. \n\nMy hotel room for the wedding night was across the hall from my parents, so after the \"reception\", we retreated over there to change and relax. The AC was broken. In the on position. So it's May in Las Vegas and it's 62 degrees in our hotel room. They can't send anyone up because there's no maintenance staff available to look at it. We end up putting on pajamas and huddling under the blanket to stay warm while we watch Star Trek. \n\nMeanwhile, we can hear my aunt dying laughing in the hall over our DND sign on the door, because we had clearly \"started the honeymoon fast\". My uncle bitched because we were \"doing THAT\" with my stepsibs and parents across the hall. My stepsibs are so sugar high that I'm pretty sure at least one of them discovered a new dimension and my mom started beating on my door telling me she is going to make me have the kids sleep in my room for the night so I can get first hand experience at what parenthood is like. Luckily, my stepad talked her off that ledge....\n\nThe next day, we went to change hotels and once again.... prepaid reservation lost. That was the ONLY thing that worked in my favor, because upon hearing that, the day manager upgraded us to a suite, got us tickets to the concert in their theater (sadly, we were too young to attend so she unlocked the CCTV of the concert to our room for free), and booked us a cabana at the pool. \n\nBut yeah, disaster start to finish. I think it was the Universe trying to warn me off of marrying him.",

Anyway, we were off to a bad start because my father-in-law and his family decided last-minute that coming to the wedding was going to be too much of a hassle (I still haven‚Äôt completely forgiven him for that) and then his mother had to turn around during her layover because her husband who had just had eye surgery hemorrhaged and almost went blind (valid excuse). So my husband had no parents at the wedding. \n\nDay of, everything was going great until what was supposed to be the start of the wedding. The time came and over half the guests weren‚Äôt there yet because the bus we had chartered to take people from the hotel to the venue hadn‚Äôt arrived. My dad kept texting my sister that he was ‚Äúhere‚Äù with the bus and where was the bridal party?? Well, when the wedding was supposed to start we realized that ‚Äúhere‚Äù meant the hotel, which was 30 minutes away from the venue, and he was holding up the bus because he for some reason thought I was riding to the venue with them. \n\nMeanwhile, I‚Äôm losing my shit upstairs in the barn rafters we were using as a dressing area because I lost the piece of paper I had written my original vows on the year before (never did find it, had to say them from memory) despite reminding my husband several times that day not to forget his. \n\nOnce it finally started the very casual ‚Äúceremony‚Äù bit went fine, the food was excellent and the party was a blast... so much so that for a while we couldn‚Äôt find our event coordinator for almost an hour because TURNS OUT she was outside in the gazebo fucking one of our friends she‚Äôd just met that night. Then, on the bus ride home, my brother-in-law projectile vomited into his cousin‚Äôs hair and one of my uncles had to pay the very disgruntled bus driver a $200 clean-up fee. It was a wild night but in the end it was awesome.\n\nTL;DR: neither of my husband‚Äôs parents attended the wedding, my dad got confused and held up the bus that was transporting half the guests from the hotel to the venue delaying the start of the ceremony by 45 minutes, I lost the paper I‚Äôd written my vows on, my wedding planner fucked my friend in the gazebo during the reception, and my brother-in-law projectile vomited into his cousin‚Äôs hair on the bus home. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

His Father remarried a woman and she wasn't very nice to him and his sister.  His Father often traveled for work and he said \"as soon as his truck went around the corner step mom was in her car and gone and we wouldn't see her until hours before he got back.\"  Him and his sister pretty much raised themselves.\n\nOver time I figured out his Dad was an alcoholic.  I will say I never met the guy.\n\nTom got engaged to a very nice woman and I was really happy for him.  They planned out all the wedding.    \nOne day Tom came in all excited and said his Father was flying in for the wedding.  \n\nDay before the wedding Tom and I went to the airport to wait for his Dad.  Tom told me one of the reasons his Dad was coming was because he had sent his Dad the money for the plane ticket.\n\nWe waited at the exit and I watched the arrival board.  Wasn't that big of place and only 3 planes came in around that time.  Each arrived and his Father never showed.  We even stood there after all planes were in and the bags were off the carousel.  \n\nTom was on the verge of tears.  I asked if he wanted to go to customer service and check to see if Dad got delayed some place.  Tom couldn't even speak, just shook his head no.\n\nTom never said a word on the way home.

After discussing with everyone, we decided to require either vaccination or a quarantine with negative test. That seemed pretty common sense, but my family, who had literally agreed to that in private conversations, blew up when we posted it to the Facebook group and website about 2 months ago. The crazy thing is, not a single person contacted us to say they had an issue and/or tried to figure out a solution. It was all texting behind our backs until we got a family grouptext that was paragraphs long of just pure hatred and name calling from my stepmom, which was when I blew up.\n\nMy older brother, who was to be the best man, backed out and pulled his daughter, who was to be the flower girl. My step mom said she messaged everyone in the family and warned them not to come, and also tried to pull my two younger brothers, who were to be groomsmen. My dad tried to repair things, but after multiple talks it was made clear that he actually thought we were in the wrong, he spent the entire conversations trying to get us to apologize and relax our safety restrictions to just tell people to ‚Äòmake an effort.‚Äô He also said my step mom had come around and planned to attend, at which point I told him she was not welcome without apologizing, which caused him to defend her nasty messages, so I texted her personally to tell her she wasn‚Äôt welcome. \n\nYou may be wondering about my fianc√©‚Äôs family? They have all been vaccinated already and are traveling from out of state to come. There was a Facebook spat that happened with me and some distant relative in January, and that allegedly caused somewhere between 10-20 family members to opt out, but I‚Äôm perfectly fine with that. The only real concern we have from them is that my fianc√©‚Äôs sister is nuttier than squirrel turds and we‚Äôve made sure to tell her and the entire family that she isn‚Äôt welcome, but their mom wants her there and could possibly try to just show up with her, but that‚Äôs unlikely.\n\nSince I‚Äôve been fighting with my entire family, one of my uncles has changed his mind and apologized, admitting he misread the post and overreacted. I‚Äôve told the other members that if they are seriously going to treat us like this for our wedding, they are dead to me. I‚Äôm still half expecting my dad to pull out and take my other two groomsmen with him. It‚Äôs absolutely ruined my excitement for the wedding. I have to find another best man and I don‚Äôt have any real close friends. The worst part is that I‚Äôve always been the one to get the family together, help them move, etc., and the one time I actually need my family to support me, this is what I get.

We'd called the court and it was to be a courthouse wedding (but it was a really cute, quaint courthouse). I had my dress, cake ordered, flowers ordered, and photographer booked. My parents had bought tickets to fly (overseas) to attend. We'd booked a small reception for 12 at our favourite restaurant back in the city.\n\nThe courthouse screwed up. We called a week before to confirm our date and the clerk told us that since I'm a foreigner I had to wait two months from the date of registration for the actual legal wedding.\n\nSo we scrapped all our plans and got married in my friend's living room at her flat. All in all it turned out sweet; but our guests didn't have chairs, we ate off paper plates, we called for take-out. The one really nice thing is that we decided to go ahead with the photography, but at the castle in town (just down the street from us) so our photos from that day are really nice, even though we didn't actually get married there!\n\n3 months later we had our legal ceremony at the local courthouse in the city. We didn't invite anyone; just our witnesses and translator. My husband's witness was his best friend and mine was my friend who had come to our earlier ceremony. I also booked a photographer for that day just to memorialize the occasion.\n\nOn the day before the ceremony I confirmed the time with the photographer and she cancelled on me. No reason, just said sorry I can't make it.\n\nThen, my \"friend\" who was supposed to be my witness didn't show up. Just didn't come. I called, texted, all day. I had spoken to him a week before and confirmed and all was fine. We never had an argument or anything like that. He just ghosted me. Thankfully our translator was there to sign as my witness; otherwise we'd have had to pull a witness off the street.\n\nAll the other crap from the initial ceremony was fine; I dealt with it. But having my friend just not show up like that really got to me. It made it a very unhappy day to remember. I've never heard from him since. He quit FB and all. I know he and his family are okay b/c people have seen him around town, and I'm still FB friends with his brother.

Unfortunately, the venue had a very strict \"no animals\" policy, and the bride's mother refused to go anywhere/do anything without her teacup poodle by her side. At the rehearsal, the mother has the dog with her and was told by three different people that worked at the venue \"sorry, your dog has to go, we could get in serious trouble if we let it slide\" to which the mother replied along the lines of \"certainly, I'll do anything for my daughter.\" One other thing - part of the wedding plan was that a 3 minute video would play after the bride and groom were at the altar, but before they said their vows. Neither bride nor groom had seen the final video because it was supposed to be a surprise (nearly half of it was people who couldn't be there giving their congratulations and well wishes and such), therefore the A/V folks couldn't play it during the rehearsal.\n\nAnyway, as you probably guessed, the mother shows up with the dog on the day of the wedding. The mother throws a huge fit, \"you're going to ruin my baby's special day!\" etc. *The bride* comes out very obviously halfway through getting ready - she had a robe on, half her hair done, and incomplete makeup and yells at her mom \"Me and *three other people* told you to leave the dog at home, if anyone's trying to ruin today, it's *you!* If you won't listen to them, I'll have \\[Groom's dad\\] walk me instead!\" So the mother gets offended and leaves, but much to my surprise the bride isn't all that phased by what happened. I thought I heard the bride say something like \"this is why I had a backup plan\", but there was too much other noise for me to know for sure.\n\nHere's the thing - all that isn't what ruined the wedding. That was just backstory. 5 minutes before \"go time\", the A/V guy starts running around in a panic. Someone was supposed to hand him a flash drive with the video on it, but surprise! No one has it. A few phone calls are made and what do you know? The bride's mother has it! Somehow this woman managed to get her hands on the thing and kept it \"in the event she was kicked out\". If the bride & groom wanted the video, *they* would have to convince the venue to let her walk the bride down the aisle with the stupid dog. This broke the poor bride, and because she didn't actually know where in the venue the groom was, she called him on her maid of honor's phone to discuss what to do.\n\nThe story has sort of a happy ending though: they ended up cancelling the ceremony and asked the guests to sit tight for about an hour or so. During this time, the bride, groom, maid of honor, best man, and officiator all got together in a back room and did a quick ceremony of their own; then the wedding party took a couple pics (ruined makeup and all), and the emcee came out and said \"scratch that folks, they eloped, so let's have a party!\" and went straight into the reception. If Instagram is to be believed, the couple are still together and happy, but the wedding is a \"we don't talk about that\" subject.",

Beautiful wedding in a charming church, priest did a phenomenal job and it all felt very intimate and touching. They didn't have much money and hosted the reception in the basketball gym next door. Appetizers were Chex mix and popcorn, dinner was pasta, DJ was loser older brother playing random tunes from a boombox, beer served from coolers, paper plates and plastic silverware, photographer was an aunt with no experience. I knew he didn't grow up poor and the ceremony could have been classier, but I was fine with all of this. \n\nSpeech went great but room was awkward as hell and only got worse when a dozen or so people got up after me to make impromptu speeches. My friend was clearly uncomfortable, looked embarrassed, and feigning enjoyment through a strained smile. I don't think he enjoyed it, no one danced and everyone left early. \n\nBut the cringiest wedding moment I've had came at the end when he told us \"not bad for something I pulled off at the last minute as cheap as possible.\" Biggest day of his life and he put minimum effort into it. He was proud he did it all for so cheap. I felt bad for them, I can't imagine they are going to enjoy looking at their wedding photos. It's one thing to have something bad happen at your wedding, it's another thing to not really care.\n\nBonus: I left a vacation early and flew 16 hours across the world for him.

Champagne was flowing. The band music was terrific. The bride and groom were gorgeous together. I had known the groom for years. His bride was a lovely woman. I was happy for them both.\n\nAs I stood there, admiring the crowd and enjoying this happy celebration, the Best Man sidled up next to me and said, \"I give it a year.\"\n\nNot too long after hearing this gloomy prophecy, I spied a disaster in the making. What I saw had me plowing my way through the crowd,  trying to chase down the the head of the catering company. No time to lose.\n\nThe caterer was a short and stocky and extremely efficient Scotsman. All business and very much caught up in his responsibility of oversight and making damn sure things were going to plan. He wasn't about to be waylaid by some pest of a wedding guest asking him silly questions. He did he damned best to wave me off.\n\nFinally, I caught up with him and yelled at him over raucous and booming live band music:\n\n\"It's the CAKE!\" I hollered at him. \"THE CAKE!!!\"\n\nAfter the Bride and Groom had cut their first slices from the magnificent, towering 3- tier confection of a cake (such a cake!), the guests had flocked in to help themselves. Within  minutes, as people started hacking away at the bottom layer, the cake began to tilt to the side. The 2nd and 3rd layers were gradually sinking into the bottom layer. Things were \"going sideways\" and fast.\n\nMy desperate yelling and arm-waving worked their magic. The Scotsman could see I wasn't fooling around. He vigorously pushed his way through the crowd. Just in time, he managed to grab the top tiers of that magnificently constructed, ornately frosted creation.  Hooray. The cake was saved.\n\nI still feel pretty good about that. There's something to be said for staying at least partially sober when all around you are getting plastered.\n\nOh. And in case you're wondering:  the Best Man was right. The marriage didn't last a year. But it certainly was a lovely wedding and reception. The music and dancing alone made it a wedding to remember.",

At the time we had been dating 2 years and were expecting our first child. The day of the wedding my husband‚Äôs ride to the venue was his big brother, and they were expected 30 minutes before the ceremony.\n\nThe mass was scheduled to start at 1 and my family and guests were waiting at the church. My future husband was nowhere to be found at that hour and we could not reach him or his family on the phone. About an hour later the guests began to panic and I started to cry because I thought he wouldn‚Äôt come and got cold feet. I was ready to cancel everything and run home, but around 3:30 he arrived with his family. My father and I were furious about the situation, but everyone told us to start the mass.\n\nMy father reluctantly walked me down the aisle shaking with rage, not saying a single word. I walked down the aisle holding back tears and feeling my father‚Äôs shaky hands. The ceremony took all of 25 minutes, and after the mass things got worse.\n\nWe went over to sign our marriage papers with our witnesses and as we did this, we heard our guests yelling. We heard someone say ‚Äúhe hit her!‚Äù In Spanish. I immediately tried to run out of the church to check on my mom and family because when tensions are high, they‚Äôre usually in the middle of things. My witnesses and husband held me back from going outside  because they didn‚Äôt want me to get involved in any altercation because of the pregnancy. I couldn‚Äôt see anything that was going on but I heard a huge commotion and a lot of people yelling at once. I was terrified that something happened to someone, but I could not see anything from where I was.\n\nWhen everything finally calmed down, my mom came in and held me. She said everything was okay but that my husband‚Äôs brother had caused a huge scene. Apparently he wanted to bring in live music for the reception, but the church does not have a license for that so the priest and his wife didn‚Äôt let the band in. (We had told him previously during planning that this wasn‚Äôt an option, but he brought them anyway) \nWhen he was turned away, he struck the priest‚Äôs wife in the neck. He yelled at her (called her bitch), and tried to punch her, but the rest of his family held him back and took him outside.\n\nAfter this altercation apparently my husbands mother said ‚Äúokay we are not wanted here family, we are leaving‚Äù and she took EVERYONE from my husband‚Äôs family home with her. My husband and I had no idea until she was gone. We walked into the half empty venue and there was no one there for him. Half of the tables and chairs were empty with his family‚Äôs name cards. \n\nMy guests said nothing. They didn‚Äôt know whether to stay or go or how to even react to everything. They just looked at me and my husband with pity. We seated them and tried to go on with everything, but everyone was still feeling awkward at 7pm, and it was just a horrible night overall.\n\nIn the end, one of my guests gave me the gift of a hotel stay. She knew we were supposed to live with my husband‚Äôs family and she didn‚Äôt feel safe with us going home after the ordeal. We ended up staying at the hotel and never going back to live with his family. We were homeless for a short period after the wedding, but we managed to get on our feet before our daughter was born. \n\nTo this day my husband feels like he was betrayed and abandoned by his family during the wedding , but they‚Äôve made amends. \n\nWe still go to the same church and the priest even showed us the security clip weeks later. In the clip you see his brother (6‚Äù3) yelling and lunging at the priest‚Äôs wife and it‚Äôs very scary. I‚Äôm glad we didn‚Äôt see it as it was happening and we were extremely lucky she didn‚Äôt press charges.\n\nIt‚Äôs been 6 years since all of that and luckily we are still standing.

Anyways after the wedding, groom's side had a friend who got WAY too drunk. He's already a guy with a reputation as a loose cannon. He gets super pissed at someone and ends up wanting to fight. Everyone is trying to calm him down which just makes him more mad. He ends up hitting someone in the face and then pushes the groom down a set of stairs. Luckily the groom caught himself before any injuries, but he busts a hole in the drywall of an expensive (resort/hotel/cottage). The police were called immediately after this.\n\nWhen we think this could not get any worse, it turns out that the bride's side ALSO has a loose cannon of their own that does drugs, the bride's brother, actually. So somehow word makes it out of the house we are currently in that this guy is fighting people going crazy and ruining the party. So bride's brother decides he is gonna fix it. He comes storming into the house looking for this guy, who by this time we have managed to calm down and is falling asleep. So of course we don't want the brother to go in there and wake him up just to fight him and make it all worse again. \n\nWell, little do we know the brother is drunk/high out of his mind and so he does not understand at all and gets SUPER pissed. He storms out of the house back to the town square where everything is. A couple minutes later I walk outside and there's screaming and yelling and the bride is sitting down crying with her head in her hands, and a dude walks by me with his finger barely hanging onto his hand anymore, and the bride's family is doing their best to hold her brother on the ground.\n\nApparently, he walked out there super pissed and when someone told him to calm down he completely flipped and swung on them. So he and his step dad got into a literal fist fight before it came to the ground, and the grandfather got his hand a little too close to his face and the brother damn near bit his finger off! So me and my friends get out there, 2 of us were wrestlers in high school, keep in mind most of us are just 21 years old so we are pretty young, and we go over there to hold the guy down. He realizes pretty quick he isn't going anywhere anymore and stops fighting back. Right about that time the police FINALLY show up, but they're here for the groom's friend who is passed out asleep by now. They had no idea about this whole situation that developed between the call and them showing up. \n\nSo the night ends with the bride's brother being taken away in handcuffs and her grandfather being rushed to the ER. \n\nGah it all feels like a fever dream. This all happens around midnight too so pretty much EVERYONE is drunk during all of this. \n\nI know how crazy and exaggerated this story sounds but every bit of it actually happened. We joke with my friend now that none of us are ever going to be able to top his wedding (he is the first to be married out of our group). Crazy ass night.",

So many family members and friends flew in for this event.\n\nI got a text the morning of from his sister that the grandfather had passed and the wedding wasn't happening. That afternoon tons of friends & family started showing up at the apartment and I assume they moved all the catering food to the apartment from the event space.\n\nThe parents seemed kinda of religious but idk if the kids were, but marriage can be a big family-community type deal to some people so it still might matter, so I googled if a death in the family affects your ability to get married in their religion.

My former roommate (we graduated and he had military obligations that took him to a different state) was supposed to be getting married in A huge wedding.  I was a groomsman. I had my tux, flight, hotel, time off work etc‚Ä¶. Got a text from the best man hours before I left for the airport, that the wedding was cancelled. What happened was the couple had been together for over a decade and didn‚Äôt realize, until a huge knock down argument the night before, that they no longer saw eye to eye on basically anything anymore. Hell of a time to find out but better than after the wedding.  Must have been mortifying for him as his entire family was there from both coasts of America and out of country.\n\nThis was not a massive shock as they had nearly broken up a few times over the couple of years before and I guess just bearer down and tried to push through getting married, with predictable results but luckily before any this real happened. \n\nGood thing is he is now, a few years later, with someone who seems much better suited to him and he is much happier. Can even see it in photos. Seems to carry himself with much less weight on his shoulders.",

Her dying wish was to see the bride marry so the two of them had an arranged marriage via the parents' recommendation. I was from the groom's side. Not family but my mom was his long time coworker and friend. Apparently I was originally not invited because the dying mother had a \"bad feeling\" about me. Which I felt offended about because I don't know her. I've never had a single conversation with her. We've only ever met in passing and never beyond a greeting. \n\nBut my mom couldn't go last minute so I was asked to show up as her representative. It was a traditional wedding dinner. They registered a week before. The groom, knowing I don't like wearing dresses, told me it was fine for me to show up in pants. He's already informed the bride and she agreed that dresses were not to be mandated. So I showed up in a pair of black dress pants and an orange blouse. I paired it with some heels. And did light makeup. Because I'm a curvy and fleshier woman and I was from the groom side, a few of the drunk aunties thought they'd make jokes about the groom being swayed by my charms. \n\nIt made us really uncomfortable. The bride wanted to take a photo with all the girls and the aunties forced me right next to her to \"make her look skinnier\" and then made jokes about a cat fight between us. \n\nThe dying mother got so upset she came up to me and told me she needed to talk with me and dragged me outside. She began to berate me for dressing like a slut and for ruining her daughter's day and then demanding to know what my intentions were. She demanded I leave so their family can repair the damage I've done. \n\nI was so disgusted with these people that I did leave. I wanted to leave the moment those drunk aunties started making those jokes but because the groom was my mom's friend, I stayed. \n\nThis was insane because the groom and I did not have ANY sort of relationship beyond him being my mom's friend and me being my mom's daughter.

Neither of us don't care too much for her so we didn't attend. She tends to be fairly self centered. But anyway, her and her mother did NOT get along. FB posts for weeks prior to the wedding the bride kept asking, \"How do you UNINVITE your mother to your wedding??\" Seriously. Several times. I mean, I get it, I had a strained relationship with my mother too.\n\nAnyway. The bride's BIL (her older sister's husband) went to pick up the bride's mother and sister (hubby's mother) to be taken to the ceremony. The bride's mother sat in the front of the car and right as the BIL got in to start the car to take off she slumps over and promptly dies right in his seat.\n\nApparently, at this point, BIL with hubby's mother in the back who is the sister to the mother of the bride, goes straight to the hospital. I mean, of course, and also naturally, hubby's mother (being the bride's mother's sister) wanted to go with her to the hospital too. SIL was told about what happened as well as the bride's sister (the wife of the BIL) and word got around that NO ONE WAS TO TELL THE BRIDE.\n\nThe ceremony and the reception go on with out the bride's mother and sister/mom to my husband/aunt to bride. They also miss the wedding photos. This INFURIATED the bride. The next morning at the \"breakfast after the wedding\" breakfast thing the bride storms up to my SIL and angrily says, \"Don't tell me my mother DIED on my wedding day.\" With no awkward response from my SIL it was pretty much confirmed that her mother did die. When SIL/hubby's mother showed up, apparently the bride yelled at her for missing the wedding photos because she was at the hospital with her dead sister.\n\nNow you know why hubby and I didn't bother attending considering the bride. She's also banned from our home for yelling at my wonderful MIL like that who was concerned for her sister's death. Also, an unironic twist of fate since the bride had been wanting to uninvite her mother to her wedding anyway.",

We had friends who had no problem supplying alcohol to underage folks, so we had a party a week before the that included a bonfire, four wheelers, alcohol, and probably weed. At some point we realized someone (read groom to be) had forgotten the hot dogs, so the bride who was not happy about that decided to take the four wheeler back to the house to grab them. I'm a ride and die friend so I went to. Somehow we got back without getting arrested. \n\nAnywho, party continues. Future groom gets drunk af. He's getting married in a week, then it's off to basic with him. And he's 18. So he's drinking. A lot. At around 2 am ish, most people are done. So those who want to, leave.\n\n At 5 am the bride calls me panicked (I was the DD.) Her dumb*** fiance decided it would be a good idea to take the four wheeler for a spin. Well, he wrecks it and shatters his collar bone. So I go pick her up and we sit in the emergency room for hours. Also, someone had to come up with a cover story to keep a lot of people who supplied the alcohol from getting in trouble. He spends the rest of the time leading up to the wedding in the hospital mellowed out on morphine. \n\nDay of, things are awful. The bridesmaids dresses are a  terrible washed out green and sickly peach with crooked hems. We're carrying 10 lb baskets of flowers. The mother of the bride is all happy cuz she got her dream wedding. The groom is so high on pain pills  he's just vaguely smiling and swaying in place. While walking down the aisle the bride starts laughing so hard she's crying. The pastor tries to pass it off as her being overjoyed. Yeah no, it sounded like a shotgun wedding.\n\nFinally to round it all out, the food is cheese cubes, cake and punch. That's it. At this point it's 3 pm. The wedding party had been running around on no food since 9 am. Finally, at 5, the bride, the groom whose still high in pain pills pull out in a fire truck. And I went to get a burger. \n\n4 years later they got an incredibly acrimonious divorce, and 5 years after that my former best friend turns into a raging b**** and cuts me from her life in a very painful way.

I dont¬¥t expect you to not make any mistakes in a live performance but I expect you to at least give a damn and not to bitch on everyone like you¬¥re some superstar. At the party she just skipped 4 of the songs because she either forgot the lyrics completely or fucked up right at the beginning and just stopped dead in her tracks before throwing a tantrum.

The groom, having had a few Jack Daniels, rightfully stepped in to keep these guys off of his bride. I happened to be out back smoking a joint and when I returned there was an all out brawl on the dance floor. All I could see was about 4 people stomping and kicking the groom on the dance floor including the bride!

We still went through with the wedding, but around two-thirds of the guests simply couldn't make it.

So the wedding was a bit of a bust, as was the reception, but we're still married 28 years later and that is all that matters.\n\nAs an aside, I used to be pretty vocal that I would never marry.  I even had what I called the \"M-word speech\" for women who started getting that marriage gleam in their eyes in which I made it perfectly clear that I was not the marrying kind of man.  Basically it boiled down to \"it'll be a cold day in hell before I ever get married\".  The morning of my wedding, with snow all over the ground in north Florida, my best man called me up at around 0600 and said, \"man, I don't know about hell, but I think this is as close as it gets\".

Waiting on more guests and the wedding party to arrive. A lot of well intentioned \"help\" running around, causing confusion. \"We grew up together, this is important for her..more of us showed up than you set up tables for.. can you still feed us all?\" I let them know we were still under the booking total. This is mildly annoying, as questions are always worded as mistakes to be corrected. I reassure all we have capacity to seat/feed them.\n\nWedding party arrives, we start putting food out. Mother of the bride looks at me with concern, asks if I can take her to the chef. Her first question is.. whether the breaded chicken is gluten free..\n\nWell, gluten is an ingredient in the standard cooking oil, everything will have it. Chef immediately stops, gets his order form, clearly marked with date, capacity, menu, and checklist of allergies.. nothing is listed. She's frozen this whole time.. tries to compose herself as she says.. \"no, no..no... I.. I.. didn't order gluten free..but the grooms family, (parents, aunts/uncles etc- entire extended family present) are gluten intolerant. I had no idea. What can you do?\"\n\nWell.. it's 730pm, the only other consistent question I've gotten is.. \"when can we eat?\" They're hungry.\nShe walks out and and the chef and I both say the same thing out of exasperation.. \"lets marry them tomorrow night\"..\n\nThe grooms family..can only have salad. Energy in the room is down, as his family found out they can't eat. Everyone who has asked me a question about food quantity is now giving me a dark look.\n\nOne of the oversharing/flirtatious bridesmaids, \"Katie,\" told me earlier, after a bunch of menu questions I was able to handle for her.. about a bad breakup she's getting over. Said there aren't too many guys here she likes & that I should find her later when it's time to dance. Strong crazy vibe feels.. not to mention totally inappropriate. Hard pass. \n\nKatie is back now.. asks me if we can talk somewhere private. I nod at the bartender, he trails behind so I have a witness. She starts ripping me personally for the issue, just name calling, tells me I'm just like her ex etc..she works up to \"heartless, genocidal crowd starving, lying, f*cking inbred sociopath (points for creativity, no? Nowhere near the U.S. south, if you're wondering).. then gets the idea that.. we refund the cost for everything and purchase them food from elsewhere at our expense, immediately.. or.. she'll sue.\n\nWell..there won't be a refund when 90% of the people can eat and the mistake wasn't ours, but I don't tell her that. She demands all this of me and I let her vent. Thanked her for sharing her concerns, as she began winding down. I came back to the chef calling his friend who owns a restaurant nearby, for 23 individual gluten-free meals, trying to salvage this for them. The mother of the bride is more than happy to pay for it, very appreciative that we may have a solution.\n\nWhile this arrives after everyone else is having seconds, the energy does return to normal. At the end of the night, Katie approaches me again, slips me her number..and forces a hug on me, as I stand there like a statue, hands crossed behind my back..kisses my cheek, promises me she isn't drinking (breath confirms), says she \"wasn't very nice earlier,\" that I should call her and she'll make it up to me. Bartender confirms he didn't serve her. Can only imagine what kind of rollercoaster that would've been.\n\nThe mother of the bride came and thanked us afterwards, in tears, which is what's really important here.\nSo, I guess this is a ruined, jk not quite, story. I usually enjoy the parties, so it did kind of ruin things for me. For the next few months I was looking over my shoulder, expecting her to show up randomly, as she'd mentioned being 10 minutes away.\n\nMoral of the story is.. check with the bride and grooms immediate family and see what food allergies they have before ordering..?\nI don't mean to brag, but I think it's a pretty good idea..",

So I just shrugged and started walking back up when I remembered how far I had to bend over to place those candles and with a bit of luck found the ring right next to the last candle.

Our wedding was initially going to be held on my paternal uncle‚Äôs property. Tented, catering, tables, chairs, it‚Äôs all been paid for. We were just awaiting the day. Then he says my mom is not allowed to come or else he will call the cops and have her arrested for trespassing.\n\nMy mom. On my wedding day.\n\nSo we scrapped the whole thing and had to find a completely new venue on mutual ground and replan the wedding. We were forced to change the date, and attempt to get refunds for all of our pre-purchases. I was a fucking mess, and my then-fianc√©e was such a saint by handling all of the hard stuff.\n\nWe ended up getting married in the upper level of a grocery store and it was badass. I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. Most of what I remember was how much fun I was having with my husband. We were just so excited to be married.\n\n**WHAT WENT WRONG**\n\nMy moms boyfriend showed up after the reception and my dads side of the family is disgusted enough to all get up at once and leave. I had to beg my dad to stay for one dance with me. \n\nShe kept getting in to my iPod to change the music so she could slow dance with her new boyfriend for ever. even though I had told her that I worked on the playlist for months. My bridesman had to be the bouncer for my music lmao. \n\nAt one point they both disappeared while we were cleaning up and all I could find was my mothers *shoes*.

He and I have been super close since we met as freshman. His wife is a peach, and her family is amazing. The wedding was scheduled for unfortunately right in the start of the pandemic and was pushed off for several months. Due to my financial situation i lost my job early last year and told him I wasn't going to be able to attend unfortunately. He was okay with it, I told him I'd send a gift and all that jazz.\n\nWell maybe a month before the rescheduled date his fiance calls me up (I'd only spoken to her in short blips when he and I were gawking via discord chat) and basically BEGS me to come. She says that if money as an issue all I'd have to do was find something to wear and get to an airport. Her family would house me and my (now ex) bf, they'd make sure we got food, and even pay for a plane ticket tk get there. Apparently my friend didn't have ANYONE coming that wasn't in the wedding party. I knew he had a rough life growing up and his mother was emotionally abusive and his dad was never in the picture... But I had no idea it was so bad. I told her not to worry and that I'd be there. I managed to scrape together enough money for a cheap hotel and gas to get to and from and we showed up, myself my bf and his aunt, and 2 of his coworkers were his only guests in a wedding planned for 200 people. The best man couldn't make it (he lives over seas) so our other friend was promoted to best man and one other friend was in the wedding party. The 3 of us friends made sure he had the best time while we were visiting. And I'll never forget the genuine weeping happiness in his eyes when he saw his aunt showed up as a surprise.",

A great and unique ceremony turned into a pretty epic lakeside party as the sun went down.\n\nAfter an hour or two of flowing drinks and the usual dancefloor shenanigans, my cousin asked me where her boyfriend was (a close friend of mine for years), and I realized I hadn't seen him in a while. Keep in mind- this friend of mine was an amazing guy, but had a very troubled past and a history of Heroin abuse (he has been sober for a couple years at this point).\n\nA few minutes later I hear my cousin screaming incoherently from amongst the rows of cars. I ran over and my dear friend is slumped over lifelessly in his truck; his skin a sickening shade of white and blue, the likes of which I have never seen. I immediately recognized that my dear friend was dying before our eyes and we didn't have much time. \n\nI ran back towards the dance floor, knowing my brother was there (a seasoned trauma nurse with a military background- just the kind of of guy you want on your side if you need to save a life, or take one). I find him and we both sprint towards the truck, and I immediately dial 911 as he pulls my dear friend from the truck and immediately begins CPR/pulseox monitoring.\n\nBy this point there is quite a confused and intoxicated crowd gathering around the scene and disrupting a literal life being saved. I put my other brother in charge of clearing everyone out of the area, and task one of the only sober relatives I see to drive to the entrance of the property to await EMS (not easily marked and I knew one wrong turn of the ambulance could mean my friend dies in a field).\n\nI stayed on the phone with 911 until the ambulance arrived with Narcan, which is ultimately brought his lifeless body back to us in a fit of confusion and vomit..\n\nNeedless to say this event killed every positive vibe surrounding this once joyous occasion, and caused quite a bit of drama amongst the family. I was sitting there with a beer in hand at the end of it in utter disbelief, with a range of emotions I have never felt before. So close to losing one or my best friends, after coming down from such a high, whilst being so incredibly impressed by my brother's calm demeanor during this life or death situation.\n\nIf you are ever in a situation where a life is in the balance, please be a part of the solution (finding help, being the help, calling EMS).",

Everyone at the gathering knows about his stroke, and we're all pulling for him.  We're all on pins and needles, of course, because we want this to go well.  It's nervous tension in the crowd, and Mark is clearly sweating it,  but he does great, and only a few times does he need assistance.

At the reception a couple of house later, my wife and I started to walk around and greet tables after dinner when my mother called me and pointed over at Grandma.  Being a firefighter and paramedic, it was easy to see she was \"circling the drain\" as they call it. I whistled to my best man, also a FF/Paramedic and nodded towards my grandma.  He went over, checked her pulse and immediately pulled her off the chair and started compressions. At that point I realized I had to leave the room so I went outside and cried with my cousin. When the fire department showed up, half the room thought they were there for pictures or something (my sister-in-law thought there were dancers haha.) After six minutes of compressions, my best man got a pulse back and by the time the ambulance left she was responsive and talking. Realistically, she probably went into hypovolemic shock- her body just didn't have enough blood to perfuse her brain which stopped her heart. She was *shockingly* discharged the next morning from the hospital and is still alive and kicking five years later. We refer to it as \"the incident\" and other than that pretend it didn't happen.",

Then the bride gets up and rips into her whole family for skipping the church and just coming to eat. The groom chimes in to lift spirits again. A bit later the bride stopped by my table to thank me for coming, and all our other coworkers could fuck off.

Her dad was in software development and was pretty loaded. Her mom had been a stay-at-home mom for \\~20 years, and had recently moved back into the workforce doing general office stuff (if I had to guess incomes, I'd say he made 400k and she made 25k). My friend's wife had planned her expensive-as-all-get-out fairy tale wedding. It was going to be a blowout. But, her parents brought in a ton of money, especially in our area, so it was no big deal.\n\nWell, six months before the wedding, the parents had a huge blowout fight when it was revealed that the guy was cheating. They ended up getting a divorce about a month before the wedding.\n\nHer dad, after the divorce, says that he'll only match what her mom puts in... and her mom had nothing to her name. So, basically, that amounted to her dad contributing nothing to her wedding whatsoever. The expensive vendors had the deposits, but her mom couldn't begin to cover those expenses, and her dad wouldn't budge. So, every vendor booked ended up dropping and the couple was basically starting from scratch with about a month to go.\n\nWe all chipped in where we could (we were right out of college / new to the workforce, so we weren't exactly rolling in it)... We all took time off work, cooked, prepped the food, made decorations, and set up everything for them. It actually ended up going very well, I'd say a $50,000 wedding got whittled down to a $3,500 wedding by the time it was all fleshed out. As a bonus, the wedding was on Saturday... most of us had until Tuesday or Wednesday off, and we all legitimately spent the next three days enjoying the leftover food and booze at my buddy's house, before they left for their honeymoon.",

They try getting hold of him up until a month to the wedding where they decide to cut their losses and start from scratch, though for some reason everything takes longer than planned as the new organiser while they actually tried couldnt get everything sorted, they had the venue and music with nothing else.

At the end of the day we are bummed about it all but none of the little stuff really matters to us and we're happy. \n\n\nTerrible venue staff that are impossible to communicate with, being notified of their covid restrictions two weeks before turning our guest list from 175 to 50. ( for the record not county, city, state, or federal restrictions. The venue's) Then we had to cancel the week before.\n\nThe date was important to us so we decided to elope then have dinner with some family and bridal party.\n Family wouldn't allow us to elope so we had a small ceremony that her parents manage to put together at the last minute. \n\nWe had our wedding attire altered and everything was good but just needed some really tiny adjustments. \nWhen we went to pick up my suit and her dress after having them altered. My suit was almost twice as big and her dress was butchered to the point that it looked like she was wearing an inter tube around her waist. (From what was told to me...still haven't seen that dress)\n\nSo she goes with her future sister inlaw/bridesmaid to pick out a new dress for the impromptu ceremony.\nHer brother offers to get a private room at a restaurant that he had connections with. Which we would get at cost. So significantly cheaper than what we had already reserved. Happily accepted to help ease the financial burden with my inlaws insisting on covering everything.\n So everything is going okay leading up to our makeshift ceremony.\n\nDay of, My wife's future sister in law was getting ready with her and driving her to the ceremony. Wife was done (15 minutes late.. normal for her) and ready to go but Future inlaw wasn't done getting ready so my wife was 45 minutes late so future inlaw could spend 30 minutes to do lip plumper and touch up her hair.\n(And we were up a mountain with no reception, so no updates were getting to everyone waiting...started to think she wasn't coming). \n\n But she of course makes it and our impromptu  ceremony included crazy and freezing wind while being up a mountain. Her waking  down the dirt 'isle' to a song we both...really don't like. And we had a custom piece arranged for her to walk down to. But that was overlooked and wasn't used. But none of it mattered were just happy to be married. \n\n(Here is where the dumb part that were still dealing with comes in...)\nWe head to dinner. (We haven't even seen this restaurant or the room we got). We get there figure out where everything is and are trying to track down who ended up with our marriage license from the ceremony. \n\nThere are 5 seats less in the room than what we were told we could have. But all good, we played it safe and under invited. The room had 2 tables seating 10 each. So family and bridal party sorted themselves into the 2 tables.  The last 2 of the bridal part arrived but the only 2 seats left were at the family table. So we asked my wife's brother and future in law to move the family table (they were both in the wedding part as well).  Just so everyone is at a table with people they know.\n\nSince hey had already gotten their drinks, they said sure but reluctantly moved. We could tell they were upset by that and we felt bad so we went and apologized again. Explained we just tried to put everyone where they could enjoy themselves and offered to have them over for dinner in a few days to as a thank you. Future sister in law proceeds to ignores everyone at dinner including the bride asking for photos.\n\nHer brother comes over for dinner a few days later but she's apparently so mad at us that she doesn't come.\nFast forward a few months she hasn't talked to us but we keep hearing about how hurt she is. So wife finally meets with her to talk. Despite wife apologizing(again) future in law continues to tell my wife that it's her job to make sure all of her guest feel important. Then she is demanding that all we go to counseling together because we hurt her and made her feel unimportant. \n\nWe will not be going. \n\n\nI left out a lot of the other small stuff that went wrong. But its literally all of it haha.",

I was a sensible child and placed the pillow on a bag under a tree where everyone was sitting. I knew exactly where it was and between petting dogs would check on it.

Eventually I was picked up and taken to search for her with the groom (total dickwad  BTW). He was so angry the whole journey despite it being a fun custom that  everyone knew about. We drove around the countryside with big balloons In the convertible until we found my family having a lovely pint with the bride in her gown. My uncle very angrily grabbed her and demanded she come back. She said she would stay and finish her drink and meet him at the wedding. You can imagine how much angrier he was driving back....

            "text": "Nothing tragic happened, but back in 2007, DJ‚Äôed a wedding at a small banquet hall where the bride just straight up had a bad time. The first issue came when the photographer came to me to ask that I announce for the families and wedding party to step outside for pictures. Not typical, as that usually happens before the reception or candids are taken throughout, but what made things even more awkward was that dinner had just been served. The photographer, bride, and groom got into it with the photographer complaining she was ‚Äúlosing daylight‚Äù if they waited. So eventually half the room emptied while the food got cold. \n\nWhen they returned, they did the Father/Daughter dance. It was ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt She Lovely‚Äù by Stevie Wonder. Extremely common for the Father/Daughter dance and I knew to have it queued up to start at 17 seconds. I don‚Äôt know if I had hit something or it didn‚Äôt take, but it reverted back to the start of the song when I hit Play. Everyone looked at me like I had three heads when the sound of a newborn baby crying rang throughout the room for the next 17 seconds. That‚Äôs totally on me... and Stevie Wonder.\n\nLater on, the time came for the bouquet toss. I played a drumroll and counted down. The bride threw the bouquet over her head... while also dumping the entire glass of red wine she had in her other hand down the front of her dress. She burst into tears and ran through the crowd of women toward the bathroom. Most of which followed her... save for the girl who caught the bouquet, who was left standing there awkwardly like, ‚ÄúWell this is fun...‚Äù\n\nSo the bride came back out in a backup dress after some time. To get the dance floor going again and cheer things up, I thought I‚Äôd play a crowd-pleasing hit that was NOT on their ‚ÄúDo Not Play‚Äù List: ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù by Usher. Can‚Äôt miss, right? \n\nWrong. WRONG. The bride burst into tears AGAIN. A bridesmaid comes running up to me, ‚ÄúTURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF! EX BOYFRIEND SONG! EX BOYFRIEND SONG!‚Äù This raised more questions than I wanted answered because 1. She JUST GOT MARRIED and 2. How is ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù by Usher anyone‚Äôs ‚Äúsong‚Äù with an significant other? \n\nWhere was the groom during all of this? Drinking in the parking lot with his friends. Again, no tragedies happened, but that wedding sucked.",

We had some background music playing as we waited for the ceremony to start, then out of nowhere everything stops. We're in a brownout, and there's only a trickle of power going anywhere in the building. Other buildings around us are also out of power. The bride was taking photos outside at the time when one of the staff members told her what happened; she's a little stressed, but all of us are hoping this clears up soon.\n\nJump a few hours later. Still practically no power in the building, and we manage to jerry rig a speaker system for dinner and speeches. Everyone is checking ComEd to see if power has been restored elsewhere, which is has. We're all worried about dinner as well, because we have no clue how well good is being refrigerated with the little power we have. Food goes out an hour late, and all the while, the staff has been feeding the guests and the wedding party shots to keep them calm. The groom is getting more and more frustrated by the minute.\n\nNow it's time for our show. To put this in perspective, we have a 5-piece band (guitar, bass, drums, two lead vocalists), a full rack for our tracks, in-ear monitors and wireless mics, a full light setup, 4 TVs, and two subs under two monitors. ALL PLUGGED INTO A CHAIN OF POWER STRIPS PLUGGED INTO ONE OUTLET. We're terrified. We manage to play a pretty solid first set without losing power, and during our break we hear the groom drunkenly shouting about how the venue hasn't done shit to fix the power issue while the bride is crying. \n\nWe start the second set, there's one small surge of full power, and then we have a full on blackout. The groom immediately kicks open a staff-only door and proceeds to threaten the lives of the staff, various family members are trying to calm him down, the bride is sobbing, and one of the guests tries to keep music going by connecting a Bluetooth speaker to someone's phone to get music going. Eventually, the groom has gotten so drunk and angry, that cops were called (he wasn't arrested) and all of the guests were shuttled back to the hotel. We all tear down our stuff in almost complete darkness and silence.\n\nFunnily enough, the couple hires us again to play a backyard party a year later to make up for the shit show. Not a great gig all things considered, but I'm happy they got at least a little bit of closure. \n\nTL;DR: Played a wedding during a brownout, the groom was getting drunk and angry, he got violent when the blackout hit and the party ended when cops were called.",

(old school)  I go to bed about 10:30 - to be ready for the wedding the next morning at 9. \n\nAround 11PM, I'm awakened by thunder rumbling in the distance.  Around 2 the storm is getting near, by 3 AM all hell breaks loose, thunder, lightning, 50-60 MPH winds.  I look out to see the decorations fly, the table settings-gone, the chairs look like tumbleweeds, the tent is hopping up / down until the poles drop and it's flailing in the wind, the beautiful Iris flowers are all on their sides.   I run out in my underwear to pull the tent down and throw rocks on top of it (to keep if from being destroyed completely)  The storm lets up around 4am.  From 4-6 I pick up and fill a few garbage cans.  At 6, I call the tent rental guys, they tell me they'll get there shortly.  They pulled out old tent, put up new tent and provided new chairs - done by 8:30\n\nI go take a shower, get dressed and greet my friend/servers (they begin setting up/picking up) while I go to the church. \n\nAt 10, the service goes smoothly and we return to the house for the party (my wife notices stuff is different - I tell her I'll explain later.)  The food's great, lots of drinks, tons of fun.  My wife and I opt to leave around 11pm to head to a hotel.  The party continues strong until 4 am. (my best man locks up)\n\nOn the way to the hotel we share our stories of the day, I tell my wife about the story above.  Her experience was different - she slept and didn't even know there was a storm.  She coudn't believe I made it through the day with no sleep for 36 hours!.  She was SUPER thankful for everything I did to make it a great day, so she made the rest of the night extra enjoyable.  35 years later - its still going.",

So all the coworkers got a good laugh and thought that would be the end.\nFast forward to the reception which had an open bar.\nSoon I to the festivities, Helen is noticed to have 2 handfuls of shots she is carrying to the table; so everyone knows the afternoon/evening has some potential.\nSoon after the meal, Helen is sitting on a chair with another coworker's female date and there's no question the two ladies were attracted to each other as some pretty graphic making out is happening. Some of this remains unnoticed due to the dancing, but most of the coworkers are all definitely interested that table. I personally enjoyed watching people's faces contort through all the emotions from surprised to shock and then to horror as all this is playing out.\nFollowing dessert, the (5-yr-old) daughter of the bride was in the ladies restroom with grandma, when it is very apparent that there are 2 women having sex in the stall.\nSo, then a coworker's wife and the date of another coworker's date go in to detrail this train. This is all to no avail, and eventually the bride is made aware and goes into the bathroom to forcibly request the 2 parties involved to leave immediately, which they drunkenly did.\nFollowing was an evening involving a hunting bow, a failed 3some, and a harrowing rescue, but I didn't witness any of that.",

Mine and my wife's wedding.\n\nFirst, the original venue got flooded out and would take months to be back open (in fact 2 years after the flooding it is only half repaired due to covid and more floods). The day we got the call that the original venue was a no go (we had paid, and it was just a month and a few days to the wedding or so.) we went to grab lunch at a fast food place and saw a sign across the street for a dance studio that also was a wedding venue. It was in an old shopping strip center that had housed a thrift store that my grandmother and I used to LOVE going to. (she mostly raised me and was like my mom. She passed away on my 17th birthday and this gave me a connection to her sort of being there) I called and they had an opening, but a few weekend after the original planed date. No problem we took it. \n\nWe built a beautiful light wall display and it got unloaded but only the frame and one strand of lights got put up before our friends decided to hang out and talk to each other. Which is fine I guess, but they had promised to help set up and it would have looked to amazing but ended up looking a bit jinky. \n\nI made all the bridesmaid dresses and all the shirts for the groomsmen and best man, due to the same flooding that hit the original venue and other issues, there were weeks I could not work on them, so literally finished the last shirt a few hours before the wedding. The dresses were thankfully finished first. \n\nIt was a costume wedding, and we got married by a Pirate Assassin. Most of our guests were in costume. It was pretty awesome. My younger brother was my best man and we were in our kilts with a few Cherokee accoutrements. (we are 1/2 Cherokee, 1/2 Scot, and 1/4 Irish.) He also cooked much of the food. \n\nOur food was a western (Texas) and Chinese Fusion. We had  soups, Won Ton, Egg Drop, and Hot and Sour. Egg Rolls. Vegetarian Fried Rice. Dumplings. Brisket. Grilled Chicken Breasts. (Brisket and chicken expertly cooked by my brother.)Green Beans (my grandmother's recipe, made by my aunt. With ham and chicken stock and OMG they are so good.) Salad. And a few other things. Her cake was Lemon Curd and something else. Mine was 1/2 German Chocolate 1/2 Carrot Cake (my two favs) and mine was diabetic friendly and in the shape of our Firefly Fan Group logo. \n\nThe drinks were in a large ice chest, which leaked. As it was in a dance studio, they were not happy about that. BUT it got cleaned up immediately and no harm done, the drinks were put in another ice chest and all drinks and food were moved to another are of the studio that had tile floors. \n\nNow, when we got the tour of the studio and booked it, the woman told us we would have full usage of the entire place, including dressing room and practice room and so on... well, the owner showed up and told us we could not use the dressing and practice rooms.... which we were currently using to get into wedding clothes ect... So I gave him an extra $100 bucks and he relented and was happy. And yes, we got this place REALLY CHEAP!!! It was about 1/10th of the cost of the original venue. And close to the house so that was nice. (Sadly the dance studio closed down due to covid. But the owner plans on reopening soon.)\n\nWe had an app (a decent DJ program) that we put out music into and a person was supposed to dj it... they ended up not showing up due to a medical issue... then the app decided to be corrupt and not work. So I and 2 friends DJed my own wedding lol. It started a bit lame, but worked out really well. \n\nMy father, well he and my step mother brought his new puppy... and he sat out in his vehicle with it most of the time... He and my step mom left after the first dance. No real loss there. There is a lot of friction between he and my mom. Or that was my thinking... and it was a part of it. BUT...  My wife's mother insulted my step mom and my older brother's wife. (he could not be there but she and their kids were) and I did not find this out until recently. I would rather they leave than there have been drama. My wife's mother is a bit of an elitist... She is a good person, but does the back handed compliments and so forth. \n\nNow, some loved ones could not make it, and that is okay and we are in no way upset other than missed spending time with them. And we love that those that made it were there and it was awesome.  \n\nSO while our wedding was not ruined... so many parts of it could have been. But we all persevered. And it was the most amazing day our my life. When my bride walked out to come down the isle, I started UGLY crying, she looked so beautiful and serene. I cried the entire time and it was funny, no one could understand my vows. The Minister, a dear friend started tearing up as well. (so many in our life were just waiting for us to get married.) We had to stop the ceremony and hug it out LOL. \n\nWhen there is love there... nothing is ruined, it may just not be what you planned. And that is okay.",

            "text": "I'm going to spend time typing this for reasons unknown.  No one is going to read it and idiots on here are just going to accuse me of making it up for some unknown reasons.  But this is the truth.  \n\n\n20+ years ago my exwife and I were invited to some distant relative of hers wedding.  We drove for about an hour into the hills of Ohio.  We arrived at this massive gorgeous house with a very long driveway.  Once we got up to the house you could see they were setting up 5 giant circus size tents.  We get out of the car to hear someone yelling and look over in time to see one of the big center poles fall over and crash several tables to bits.  The day was one of those that would pour down rain then be beautiful every 10 min.  The actual ceremony was a little late due to rain.  Everyone sits down in the woods in front of a big arbor.  The men were all standing there and the wedding proceeded.  All of the brides maids came down the hill though the woods to the arbor.  The little kid in a tux as the ring bearer came down and found his spot.  They hit play on a tape recorder (this was 20 years ago) and the wedding march started.  The bride came down through the woods and walked up to the arbor.  They looked at each other and the guy performing the ceremony started talking.  The heavens opened up and let loose a torrential down pour.  Everyone scrambled to the house.  20 min later skies were clear.  they wiped off the chairs and we started the whole thing over.  The ring bearer was doing his walk through the woods and slipped on some mud and sent him tumbling down the hill.  They hit play on the stereo and the wedding march started.  Unfortunately no one rewound the tape and about 1/3 of the way down the hill the wedding march cut out and some hank williams jr country music started blaring.  The bride finally made it down to the arbor and the wedding started again.  right as they were exchanging vows the ring bearer vomits all over the best mans leg and shoes.  The rest of the wedding went off without issues.  Once back at the tents the rain had started again.  the tent in the back (the one that the pole fell over) was having issues and the 1 corner kept collecting water that had to be drained by pushing a broom up against the roof.  Everyone started getting up to get food 1 table at a time.  My table was last as usual.  I got my food and sat down at the exact moment the roof of the back tent let loose hundreds of gallons of water that had collected while they were getting their food.  As everyone rushed to assist them the wind was picking up and blew the table cloth of the gift table into the little fishbowl candles they had lit and caught the gift table on fire.  The dad of the bride (I think) pulled the table cloth off and all of the gifts crashed to ground with a couple of them on fire.  After that was put out and we finished eating the sun came out and everything was good to go.  I was sitting next to one of the screened in tents with a folding table in it with the wedding cake on it.  This was a huge cake with 3 separate parts.  1 big center with a smaller cake on each side with a bridge thing connecting them.  I watched 2 kids chase each other around the table and just waited.  The little kid in the back doing the chasing trips and hits the kid in front and pushed him right into the table.  The wedding cake comes crashing down the ground.  About 20 min later I was walking around and saw the bride sitting on the tailgate of a box truck crying her eyes out holding a precious moments bride and groom with the bride having no head.  The groom was drunk off his ass and dancing around.  Since I have no idea who these people were and i have been divorced for 20 years I have no idea if they are still together to this day.  I have told this story 100 times in my life and no one believes me.  All I can say is EVERYTHING I have said is 100% true!",

Rather an expensive affair. Both worked at rather large factories and had posted an \"open invitation\" to work colleagues to attend (mistake number one).\n\n\nThe wedding itself went without a hitch, however the evening reception did not.\n\n\n(Here is where mistake two and Mr Blobby come into it.)\n\n\nThe venue is filling up fast, beyond its capacity due to mistake one, four coaches full of workmates turn up and there isn't enough seats, food or drink to go around and the organisers are in a complete panic as it's becoming a fire risk.\n\n\nSo the happy couple are to start their first dance, they take to the floor, the music plays and they begin the slow dance around the floor much to the delight of all the relations.\n\n\nThe have only gotten halfway through the song when my brothers friend Geoff, aka Mr Blooby, yes, the fucking price hired a costume as he and his attention seeking wife decided this was a brilliant idea. Now I should mention at this point my brother is only 5'2\", but plays rugby. Some of the guests are his best friends who also play rugby. So, Mr Blooby barges onto the dance floor interrupting the first dance. A big no no.\n\n\nHe stumbles, in character into the bride and groom, they are suitably confused. He the drags my sister, myself, and the brides two sisters and some random blokes up to dance along with the happy couple during the first dance. My sister in law is visibly upset by this. As is everyone else.\n\n\nAfter he hear knocks the table with the wedding gifts over, bumps into the DJ booth and various people he leaves, followed his wife and few \"rugby boys\", my sister in law is now in tears. So I follow them as well.\n\n\n\nAs I get outside some of the boys have him pinned up against the wall, his wife pleading to them it was just \"harmless fun\". My contribution went something like this : \"Fun? Fun? Sister in.law is in there crying her eyes out, the fist dance is ruined and you think it was fun. How would you have liked that at you wedding?\"\n\n\nMrs Blobby: \"I probably wouldn't.\"\n\n\nMe: \"Then why is it OK for you to ruin someone else's? Let him go boys.\"\n\n\nThey did and I landed a right cross that broke his nose. \"Now fuck off, both of you.\"\n\n\nJust after they went my brother came out looking for them, ready to kill him. The rugby lads said he's gone but your brother broke his nose, don't think the blood will come out of that costume. Didn't speak to the guy for years but when they did it turned out it was all his wife's idea. The Blobby's are now divorced.\n\n\nThey redid the first dance and as the entire day was being videod professionally but the guy deleted the event and just carried on as normal.",

His ex-wife is genuinely a horrible human being that tried to murder him by ramming his car with hers, while their two kids were in it, and then claimed she was being abused, while beating the ever loving dogshit out of him. I live in the South, and the courts are less than friendly to men down here involved in things such as this, so he has been utterly fucked in his divorce. The absolute last thing he needs to do right now is get married. \n\nSo he met his wife to be while he was going through the divorce stuff, and to her credit, she kicked his ass to make sure he got it finalized, because it genuinely was causing him a lot of stress. But oh boy, she's a trip herself. She basically threatened to break up with him about 9 months into their relationship if he wasn't going to propose to her (meanwhile the ink hasn't even dried on the divorce papers yet), and so he basically gets bullied into proposing to her. So that's great. She is insanely obnoxious and trashy and is also constantly drunk or high 90% of the time, and is incredibly controlling. \n\nHis wife to be is mixed (african american and hispanic), and my girlfriend's family is from a very wealthy part of Connecticut and they DO NOT APPROVE of this AT ALL. Their mom is kind of racist, and said that \"she's fine with them getting married, as long as they don't have mixed babies\", and the other brothers are starting a pool on whether or not it happens. All good stuff. \n\nSo the details:   \n\\- Have been engaged since Thanksgiving  \n\\- Wedding is 5 months away and they still technically don't have a venue  \n\\- My girlfriend was originally going to be his best man since no one wants to do it  \n\\- Family got up in arms about it, so now I am likely going to be the best man as a neutral \"Switzerland\" option  \n\\- Since they have no venue, they're likely going to have to do it at the Holiday Inn  \n\\- No other work has been done  \n\\- Wife to be is insanely controlling and a massive alcoholic  \n\\- Family is not at all enthusiastic about this  \n\\- She is forcing him to buy a house in an area \"because of the schools\" even though the school district she wants to live in sucks  \n\\- She doesn't have money to buy a house, so he is going to be paying for all of it by cashing out his 401K, of which the ex-wife still gets $7000 from.   \n\n\nThis wedding, if it happens, is going to be an absolute shitshow.

Get in, and this huge storm brought everything. Wind, hail, lightning, etc.\n\nMy niece married a fireman. They planned to go to the fire station to take photos. They arrive. Lightning hits the frigging building! Meanwhile, we‚Äôre driving to the reception hall on the SW side of Chicago and all we are seeing going over I -55 is lightning strikes everywhere! \n\nWell, the fire station was ok, but the reception hall lost power. That whole area of the city lost power. Now, the stoves kept the food hot, so the only issue was no a/c and no lights. The staff brought out every candle they had but there were still tables that would be dark. This also made entertainment difficult. My other niece ( I don‚Äôt know HOW she did this) managed to find a $30 boom box that played music from i phones. \n\nThe ‚Äú ruined‚Äù part was the older crowd couldn‚Äôt stay long after the meal because it was HOT.

She was a sweet person, but turned into a real bridezilla over this wedding. \n\nWe live in the south. This is important, culturally, because while it is completely acceptable to not serve food at a wedding or have a cake and punch reception- etiquette would be to have a wedding like this not at a meal time- say 2PM. \n\nMy friend planned her wedding for 5:30, reception to follow. Right at dinner hours.  She picked out THE most expensive venue in our area, and opted for an outdoor wedding. This was in the middle of summer. It was probably 100 degrees in the shade. This is also significant. \n\nWe go, the ceremony is fine, she sends the guests off while we take pictures. I thought the guests would start eating, but no, she made them all wait, until we were done taking pictures. This was rude, but it gets worse. \n\nShe didn‚Äôt serve a meal. There were chicken salad croissants, but not enough for all the guests. No crudit√©s, no fruit, no cheese, no crackers. No punch. No alcohol. No tea, just chicken salad croissants, lukewarm water, and a wedding cake that might have stretched to 50 people, all for a wedding reception with 250 people there. \n\nShe wanted everyone to dance, etc, and no one did. The guests were overheated, tired, and starving.  I might have given her a half  pass had it been local people who could go home and eat, but she was from out of the area and some people had flown to come to this wedding. \n\nNo one stayed to see the couple off. The reception drug on too long, and when people saw there was not going to be anything else to eat, they left. \n\nI know you shouldn‚Äôt expect the moon at these things, but if you can‚Äôt afford to feed your guests then you should really downsize your wedding, choose a cheaper venue, or even just have it at an earlier time. \n\nI‚Äôve never seen so many pissed off people in tuxedos and ball gowns.",

The bride kept smiling like \"let's talk about this later :)\", like the fake Karen smile that's seconds away from breaking someone's jaw, but the groom's family wasn't having it and started hurling accusations of their own, of course the bride's family wasn't having it and had their own stuff to say about the Groom. Apparently a bridesmaid wasn't happy with the bride either because she showed a video to the groom that, I'm told, was sent to her of the bride fucking like 3 other guys at once- one of which I'm told was HER boyfriend. In front of God and everyone. Let me tell you, I didn't know porn acoustics could carry that well in a church, but it did.\n\nGroom and his boys left, said bridesmaid left with them, and the preacher tried to turn it into a sermon for some damage control, but most of us were too flabbergasted to do much besides leave. There were some people crying, but thankfully it was a pretty small gig with not a lot of people involved.\n\nLet me tell you, as someone that was just an honorary +1 to this wedding (I was basically a friend of a friend of the groom) and knew NOTHING about anyone there, I hadn't felt tension like that ever in my life. Mind you, I only know of what the friend was told or found out. I got a free bottle of vodka from the groom after I and my friend went to check on him because he sold off some jewelry he got for her and was literally just giving things to strangers. Dude was taking it okay from what I saw",

We've got a lovely apartment to stay in nearby all locations for the wedding day.\n\nWe were up by 5am to get ready for the wedding ceremony at 10am. That's when we discover the brides bra is missing, so once hair and makeup are done I go into town to track down a bra that will work with her dress, on a Sunday morning when everything is closed. I get back and find the flowers haven't been delivered as promised, so I then duck out to grab flowers for the wedding party.\n\nThe cars show up, lovely gorgeous vintage cars, and the bride insists on photos. Clock is ticking, we start getting calls from the church asking where we are... We finally get to the church a full hour late.\n\nThe ceremony itself goes really well, and it's time for photos at a local garden before dinner at the top of the gardens. So we're an hour behind schedule at this point, but it's ok because it should only take us two hours to do photos from the bottom of the gardens to the top... I'm starving because it's heading on 2pm and I haven't eaten yet because I was out running errands for the bride when breakfast was served, and being late to the ceremony meant no lunch.\n\nAround 4ish the restaurant starts calling us asking where we are, all the guests have arrived at the reception and they want to know how much longer we're going to be taking photos for... We're not even halfway through the gardens. By 7pm the restaurant is calling us to say they're serving the food because the guests are getting restless.\n\nThe maid of honor had been pushing the bride along for several hours trying to get her to get moving so we can get some damn food, by this point she's given up, just literally said to me \"I'm done... Your turn\", the other two bridesmaids haven't said a word about how long this is taking.\n\nBy 9 freaking pm we finally make it to the restaurant! And still the bride delays by getting the photographer to take more photos. I'm not kidding here, 6+ hours of stopping to take photos. My stomach is literally growling by this point. \n\nWe finally make it through the doors and I just about cried with relief at getting some food... Only to find it's pretty much all gone. There's like two potatoes left, a small amount of lamb, and a couple of scattered vegetables, some melted ice cream, deflated pavlova and a bit of fruit that definitely isn't looking it's best. Maybe enough for one person to have a plateful and there's 6 of us who haven't eaten yet. \n\nThe restaurant didn't hold any food back for the bridal party, kitchen is closed, and all that's left is the wedding cake. I actually went into the bathroom and cried at that point, it had been more than 24 hours since I'd last eaten and I was exhausted. The maid of honor and I ended up at friends birthday party about 11pm and dived into the food when we got there, because we were starving - open tab bar and all we cared about was getting some damn food.\n\nThis happened a good 15 years ago and that day still stands out to me in terms of hardest wedding I was a bridesmaid at (another one we woke up on the day of the wedding to find out a hail storm had literally destroyed crops of flowers and we had no flowers AT all for the wedding as no one had any that weren't damaged and has us scrambling calling every florist for any flower that was still in ok condition). \n\nAt least the bride was happy???",

Me and my then boyfriend got into an argument and I just completely blacked out for 5 hours. I remember going down to the toilet, and I came to myself walking up those toilet stairs to her mother yelling for everyone to leave and that the police was outside. I walked up to her and asked what was going on and she just pointed her finger in my face and exclaimed \"and YOU should be ashamed of yourself\". I had no idea what had happened so I cried hysterically the entire cab-ride home as everyone was super mad at me without me knowing why (me, bride and groom were roommates). When we got home, I went up to my room and trashed the entire room, bride/bff came up and we literally started fighting in my room, still wearing our dresses. At some point I blacked out again and had climbed out the second story window yelling about how I was going to jump, bride talked me out of it and then I yelled at our mutual friend that I hoped she would get hit by a train.\n\nI had fractured my wrist the day after and my toe was shattered, and when they filled me in on what had happened I was absolutely mortified.\n\nIt all started with grooms father getting so shitfaced that he scared the brides little sister and he had to be carried out of the reception by groom and best-man. Then me and my boyfriend started arguing, I do not remember what it was about. I had gotten pissed off, went into the locker-room to cry, a guy came in and asked if I was okay and my reaction was to throw my high heel at him. Another friend of the bride came down to talk to me, and during that talk I had gotten increasingly angry and punched a wall very hard, but she calmed me down and we went back up to the reception. At this point I have asked our 4th roommate to drive me home so I could take my meds, and when he said no since he had been drinking, I got more pissed and started screaming at him. Apparantly I had another run-in with my then boyfriend were we argued more, and then I completely lost it. I don‚Äôt remember the full story, but at some point I threatened a guest with a chair, I slapped the groom in his face, I had yelled some incredibly disturbing and selfish things at people, I slapped a mutual friend, I had gotten extremely aggressive towards brides mother when she told me I didn‚Äôt need to drink anymore (I was an alcoholic), then at some point my ex had also gotten extremely angry when people tried to confront him aswell, he threw his keys at the groom, giving him a scar on his forhead, and then he head-butted the grooms mom before he walked out. I remember the grooms mom being incredibly nice to me at some point, because I remember me crying and she came up to hug me and said \"it‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs not your fault, you‚Äôre ok\". I also received some very abusive messages from my ex after the reception because he was convinced I had stolen his keys, so he had called the police to his own apartment to break open the door (he found his keys in his jacket pocket the day after). It was a shitshow and this is one of the things I‚Äôm still ashamed of even though bff has forgiven me for it. \n\nI have to mention that there were several people who drank too much and caused chaos. Our 4th roommate started a physical fight outside with one of his friends, and when I tried to get inbetween to ask what was going on, the brides godmother pulled me away and said she‚Äôd handle it. That was apparantly a big mistake, because her approach was to start yelling at 4th roommate instead of talking calmly, so he had punched her in the face hard enough that she got a concussion. I don‚Äôt fully remember what happened to him that night, but he was also sent away with an ambulance to the next city over because we don‚Äôt have a proper hospital.\n\nI know there are several factors as to why I personally happened to have a psychotic episode that day, but I know that‚Äôs not an excuse as I was part in ruining what was supposed be one of my bff‚Äôs happiest and most important days. I know I had a drinking problem, and it‚Äôs a shame that my worst blackout had to happen on that specific day, and people that have only met me once now have that impression of me.

Nope, just cups, so I gently dipped my cup in the can. Realized that now my cup was dripping wet. Napkins?  Nope. Port-a-potty?  Of course. I grabbed some toilet paper and wrapped it around my cup while we continued to wait for the bride and groom. The sun set. They still hadn‚Äôt arrived. No lights were set up so some people turned on their truck lights so people could see the ceremony. Then we were supposed to start eating the random food people brought, that had been sitting outside for hours, in the dark. We left.",

My wedding reception was pretty lit not gonna lie. When we all arrived back at the hotel after the reception we were quite loud and eventually the hotel understandably called the police. We noticed this and most of us retired to our rooms. The guy who ‚Äúcrashed‚Äù was absolutely shit-housed, got grabbed by the cops in the hallway and got very mouthy. So they decide to carry (not walk) him out to thier squad car lol. So myself and his friend who invited him ( this guy is the bf of one of the bridesmaids btw) are standing on the balcony of my room watching his friend get stuffed into a squad car. And my friend is yelling shit at the cops from the balcony the whole time, he was pissed off that his friend was the one who got grabbed.  The cops ignored him and drove away with his friend.\n\nNow the rest of this we found out after some time had passed.  \n\nAfter the balcony I went to sleep. The friend who was pissed off decided the hotel needed to pay because they called the cops and it resulted in his friend getting thrown in the drunk tank. So he allegedly threw some of the pool furniture and maybe a planter into the pool and when he was out there he saw that cops had arrived back at the hotel. He runs.. directly across the street from the hotel was a giant empty field of grass where he decided he would hide until they left.. smash cut to about an hour later his gf ( the bridemaid ) gets a phone call at like 4 am. \n\nIts him asking her to come pick him up from side of the road that cuts through the field he was hiding in. When he got in the car she immediately knew something was off  ‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SMELL?!‚Äù He had been so scared to move while hiding he shit his pants!\n\nSome more time passes and my now father in law recieves a MASSIVE bill from the hotel claiming that there was major damages done to the hotel and its air conditioning system.

            "text": "My husband and I can look back at all this and sort of laugh now, buuuuut a lot of people would consider even a fraction of what happened on our wedding day ruining material. Buckle up.\n\nLeading up to the big day my psycho mother uninvited herself to the wedding after throwing a giant temper tantrum, on mother‚Äôs day. There was already a history of strain between us, but wedding stress ended up being the final nails in the coffin and I haven‚Äôt talked to her in years since this all happened.\n\nShe was primarily upset because we bought my mother in law a $100 dress and some shoes since she literally had nothing even semi formal to wear (social security living in pretty extreme poverty my husband‚Äôs entire life) and we thought it‚Äôd be nice to coordinate her dress colors to my husband‚Äôs suit for the mother son dance/pictures‚Ä¶.\n\nWhile my mother picked out her own dress, which was the most formal thing anyone would have worn aside from me (the bride), was way too close to being white for comfort, and was $500+ (definitely not anything we could afford even if she weren‚Äôt significantly more well off than us at the time).\n\nThen my mother wanted to control who was in what pictures and didn‚Äôt like that I wanted one with all the mothers‚Ä¶ specifically she was offended it‚Äôd be including my stepmom. I tried to compromise and told her she could have her own pictures without stepmom too, but that wasn‚Äôt good enough- I‚Äôll add that my stepmom was the only one helping me with any planning, helped pay for way more than my dad even initially agreed to, and handmade all our decorations. Mommy dearest offered help with exactly zero of these things, or anything else for that matter.\n\nAfter all this she was also pissed she wasn‚Äôt included in the catering planning/taste testing- but my dad is the picky eater and with how she‚Äôd been behaving no way did I want those two in the same space more than absolutely necessary. Plus dad paid for catering.\n\nWhen she finally had her meltdown these were just the big ones, but there was a lot of little petty things and other personal attacks thrown in too. The last phone call we ever had ended in me yelling happy fucking mother‚Äôs day, and hanging up on her. Never looked back. \n\nUnfortunately because she‚Äôs so petty, she made sure several family members on her side no showed, even after RSVPing. So we had more food and seating than necessary, but oh well.\n\nMoving onto my father in law, who is basically the male version of my mother- just not fed with a silver spoon, and chocked full of toxic masculinity for good measure.\n\nLiterally everyone in his life thinks he‚Äôs an asshole, and over the years I‚Äôve come to learn all too well why that is. \n\nA few months before the wedding he started a slander campaign against me, because he knows I‚Äôm not his #1 fan and I don‚Äôt put up with his literal abuse of my husband and his wife/ex wife/girlfriend(?)-Idk what to call their weird relationship but my in-laws divorced when my husband was very young, got back together and never remarried. He‚Äôd frequently get belligerently drunk, pick fights with all of us, and expect everyone to kiss his ass while he proceeded to fall on it- rinse lather repeat, until I finally had enough and decided to stay multiple arms lengths away from that mess.\n\nI won‚Äôt get into more details because we‚Äôd be here forever, but basically we were not on speaking terms and the only reason father-in-law wasn‚Äôt completely out of the picture was for the sake of mother-in-law.\n\nFast forward to our wedding day, and my husband invited father-in-law to run a quick errand with him- during which he simply asked father-in-law to give me space for the day. It didn‚Äôt go over well, and father-in-law completely went off saying he didn‚Äôt even want to come to the wedding in the first place among many other colorful things he had to say about me. When my husband didn‚Äôt budge and basically told him that his reaction was exactly why I didn‚Äôt want to deal with him, his dad literally started opening the car door and got out while my husband was driving out of the parking lot of the venue. It was a scene.\n\nMother-in-law and uncle were also in the parking lot witnessing all this, and were in shock as father-in-law stormed to his truck demanding they follow because they were all leaving. \n\nMy husband told him he wasn‚Äôt going to stop him from leaving, but that his mother and uncle were staying. After father-in-law spewed a bunch of bullshit to them about how I said he had to sit in the back for the wedding, couldn‚Äôt touch anything, and couldn‚Äôt talk to anyone (nobody said any of that)- they also came to the conclusion he was full of shit, and he drove off without them. This stranded them 2-3 hrs from home in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAfter that fiasco, mother-in-law decided to take an undetermined amount of Xanax, wash it down with whatever she could get from the bar, and finish off with a couple of joints. About an hour **before** the ceremony she walked up to my husband apologizing for missing it‚Ä¶so yeah she was probably as far gone as father-in-law at that point.\n\nRight after the ceremony, mother-in-law decided to change out of the dress we got her and into some worn out leggings and a tank top‚Ä¶bright red bra hanging out like a sore thumb‚Ä¶ clunky brown falling apart sandals‚Ä¶ it was bad‚Ä¶ my husband had to remind her they had a dance to do, and told her to please change back into her dress because people would be taking pictures... she pouted but went and changed back.\n\nWhen she came back out, the back of her dress was unzipped and wide open all the way to her waistline‚Ä¶Fire engine red bra out for everyone to see‚Ä¶ my husband was mortified as my sister came up discreetly as possible and zipped it up for her in the middle of the dance floor.\n\nMy poor husband looks miserable in every photo with his mother‚Ä¶ especially since during these photos she tried to pick a booger out of my stepmoms nose‚Ä¶ without warning‚Ä¶ twice.\n\nSo yeah, those are most of the hi-lights‚Ä¶ \n\nTLDR I guess my wedding was kind of a clusterfuck lol‚Ä¶\n\n*Oh jeez edited to add: I got so carried away with all the parental drama I forgot to mention-one of the guests also went into anaphylactic shock in the middle of our first dance, and their epi-pen didn‚Äôt work so they ended up spending the rest of the night in the ER‚Ä¶ They had a severe nut allergy and despite me telling the caterers multiple times in advance not to use any and double checking while everyone was lining up for the buffet that they hadn‚Äôt; the nuts they insisted weren‚Äôt used, were definitely in something. The family member hasn‚Äôt seemed to like me very much ever since üòï.*",

Momma bear was a witch and seriously hacked off and pretty much forced all to eat, drink and dance. This meant I had to play or skip a good sized paycheck. I did and no matter what song I played guests would line up to tell my choice was a wrong one. Momma was on my ass all night and she had my dough so I just did what she wanted in spite of an angry audience. Longest 4 hours of my life. In the, however, it became clear to me the groom made the right decision.",

Guess fucking who? My mom.\n\nI had told her that we were just having a small get-together and that we‚Äôd do one when I came home since each of our families live on different islands and we didn‚Äôt have lots of money (we budgeted $2500 for wedding AND honeymoon, and we both needed a good long vacation). So it turns out that rather than be excited that I said I‚Äôm coming home and she can help me plan that party, she calls my soon-to-be husband and tells him *behind my back* that she is going to fly over and drive up on an island that she‚Äôs never been to before, on the day of our wedding to ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù me.

We had decided to get married in my wife‚Äôs hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. Most of my friends and family from both coasts had never been, so we were pretty impressed when 100% of the friends we hoped would be there RSVP-ed to come. The only unfortunate byproduct of this was the volume of vegetarian meals that got ordered (this is semi-important to the story). It was an afternoon wedding to account for all the travelers, so the guests had the better part of the day to see the sights and maybe visit the Bourbon Trail and sample from some of Kentucky‚Äôs finest distilleries. \n\nSo, what you end up with is a bunch of already drunk, cosmopolitan vegetarians trying to make their way through a hot summer day in the garden of a historic mansion on Bardstown Road. My wife and I opted to do our photos *after* the ceremony, and because folks would have to wait, we of course provided cocktails and small bites. Should be fine, right?\n\nWhen we returned to kick off the reception, both my wife and I knew something was‚Ä¶ off. Like, a lot off. People were absolutely wasted and we hadn‚Äôt even started service from the open bar. It was fine, it was fun, and dinner and the party went off mostly unperturbed because we had some serious rules (‚Äúdon‚Äôt give margarita_pool‚Äôs cousin a live mic‚Äù) and a great wedding planner. In the midst of a dance with my wife, though, things turned suddenly very scary. \n\nA visibly drunk friend couldn‚Äôt find his wife. She‚Äôs been missing for hours but he‚Äôd assumed she was with friends elsewhere. A search party is formed, folks fan out, tensions are high. This goes on for 45 minutes. Friend‚Äôs wife is only found when they search *under* the chairs in the back garden where the ceremony was.

Got a call from my sister's best friend the day before the wedding saying her stepdad had gone into hospital and she was sorry but she wouldn't make the wedding, she lived a 6 hour drive away - so we lost bridesmaid, page boy and one of the flower girls.\n\nParty the night before, so everyone was pretty tired, grooms step-sister spent most of the night crying because her mother, who had died the year before, couldn't be there and her poor sister spent most of the night comforting her (on her birthday no less), and she kept everyone else awake. My sister was drunk and my brother took that to get a couple extra people invited to the wedding.\n\nGet a call about half an hour before we're due at the church from one of the groomsmen saying they're running late, his partner was with us and refused to say why they were running late, my sister freaked out that the groom was having second thoughts and locked herself in a bedroom crying. My sister's friend still refused to tell us why so I had to take her outside and tell her that if she didn't tell me then she could leave and she wasn't welcome back because apparently it didn't matter to her that her supposed good friend was literally crying off all her makeup less than 10 minutes before she's due down the aisle. Turns out the grooms party had left the marriage certificate behind and had to turn around and go get it. Updated my sister, got her cleaned up, make up redone etc and finally we get to the church.\n\nMost of the grooms side didn't show up, our side was completely full, but his side didn't even have two full rows occupied. His sister sat there clutching her mother's photo, which had been given its own seat in memory of her, and crying the whole ceremony.\n\nDespite being asked not to move the lovely wedding book I'd bought from its stand (it cost me $60!) his family took it outside, got the gorgeous satin cover grass stained and somehow managed to spill coffee all over it during the photos.\n\nAfter the photos I was running around helping the caterer and photographer, I was busy managing everything so my sister and parents could relax and enjoy everything, grooms family bitched that I was rude and didn't spend any time with them when I didn't even get to say more than a passing hi to most of my own family.\n\nBecause so few of his family showed, due to his mother telling his family members not to attend because she didn't approve, and claimed she hadn't been involved in it so she wasn't going to show herself (spoiler she'd been asked to help out and she refused to help in any way), we (I) ended up having to do mini food parcels for family members just so there wouldn't be any waste. \n\nI was the *only* bridesmaid not thanked in the speeches, by either the groom or the bride, despite the fact that I helped pay for the wedding, helped with invitations, catering, venue set up, set up the hens party as my sister requested... We all lived together so I was involved in EVERY aspect of the wedding, the rest of the wedding party just turned up for the hens party and wedding itself, but all of them got mentioned in the speeches which was pretty devastating to me after all my hard work.\n\nAt my parents house afterwards with our family and friends for opening presents, I discovered my brother (who had flown in from another country for the wedding) had gotten high on God knows what with his mates who weren't supposed to be there, and my brother started getting aggressive so I took him outside so he wouldn't spoil things yet again. His mates egged him on as he got angrier and I ended up having to get some good family friends to remove him from the property because he started to get violent while his girlfriend cried because she was ashamed of his behavior.\n\nI ended up nearly falling asleep at my parents house because I was running on fumes by 3pm, and left not long after that with my other sister and my \"adopted\" 18yo son. \n\nBut at the least my sister never knew the full extent of the drama that went on that day until well after her wedding and honeymoon. Would've maybe been all worth it if he hadn't split less than a year later leaving me to pick up the pieces with my sister as a suddenly single mother to a two year old, and pregnant with twins.",

The bride desperately tried to seem classy, while groom's relatives (including dad's side of the family) were a sort of hillbillies. The lunch was classy, expensive, but not everyone like those small food art that leaves you hungry. Some of them barely figured out it was food. They hated the music too. Groom's guests voiced they still were hungry, so as soon as they cut the cake they left and improvised a picnic in the parking lot. They knew the lunch would have been unsatisfactory and they brought home made bread, cheese, porchetta and salami, they started cutting and making sandwiches for everyone on the trunk of the cars, eating bare hands. They took turns in cutting and slicing as they had maybe 50 salami, while some of them sang, and more guests came. The bride cried and wanted the groom to cut them off. We met them when i was maybe 16, so ny family hadn't seen them in 18 years.\n\nUncle's story: a friend of him and her wedding planner organized a less formal, more modern wedding lunch. It was a standing lunch, there were no seats and two buffets on the opposite sides of the room. You can eat pasta holding the dish with one hans, but you can't cut meat. When he needed the restroom, he found people sitting on the toilet to eat. One of the main courses was risotto with ananas. Uncle thought he was smarter and instead of eating from the dish he grabbed half ananas cut like a small basket full of risotto. It was the buffet decoration, and the bride threw a tantrum because he ruined the perfect table. At last, restaurant staff brought tables and chairs (at this point, people were eating in the cars or sitting on the floor). Uncle was relieved as he spent 3 hours standing, while aunt commented: and at last they had us seated, but we still had to pick up food like those cheap bus trips.

Our best man shoved him to the ground from behind before he could stab our friend. My dad got up and picked up a chair and swung it at the other groomsman hitting him in the head.

So I turned my back on him and went to my husband and said we need to leave. I still didn‚Äôt know the full story at this point but I knew enough that I just had to get out before I cried in front of all our friends and family.

There have been a few ruined weddings but one of the worst we just refer to as ‚Äúthe vegan wedding‚Äù\n\nWe aren‚Äôt a vegan venue first and foremost, we can do some vegan options but it isn‚Äôt our speciality. Vegan Bride and groom wanted the whole wedding to be vegan. The brides mother was against it and thought they should probably just order vegan food for who was vegan. The bride and groom stuck to their guns and wanted everyone at the wedding to eat vegan (this consisted of a 3 course vegan meal followed by a vegan buffet). The bride and groom weren‚Äôt happy with our only vegan options and wanted special vegan food that we‚Äôd never even heard of. In the end we ended up coming up with a menu they were okay with. The day rolls around and the bride comes in before hand with decorations and sees that we have milk in the fridge and Baileys behind the bar. She wants these removed immediately because no one on her day is to eat or drink anything but vegan (we refuse this request) \n\nAfter the wedding, all the guests sit down and this is where we find out the only vegan guests are the bride and groom and there are a lot of kids (15 out of 50 people). We start serving the food and the guests ask what it is. We inform them of what they‚Äôre eating and some laugh, some look confused, some eat it in silence, and the kids all 15 of them outright refuse to touch it. We have parents of all of the kids complaining asking if their is anything else they can eat (we have to inform them the bride and groom has only made vegan food available) after the vegan dessert is served most of the parents have had enough and stand up and leave (mainly because all 15 kids where screaming and crying) there‚Äôs now about 15ish people left. \n\nThe night do comes in a couple of hours later (about the same amount as who left) we serve the buffet and are met with the same reaction, a couple of people order pizzas and eat them outside, a couple of people loudly say ‚Äúthis is fucking ridiculous what a shit wedding‚Äù right next to the bride who at this point is visibly distressed. One man said ‚Äúwhat have I done to you to deserve this‚Äù while pointing at the buffet which made a large amount of the people left laugh. Finally the cake is served (a fully vegan chocolate cake which was baked by the man who said ‚Äúwhat have I done to deserve this‚Äù) they cut the cake, which caused half the cake to fall on the floor. The man who baked it said loudly ‚Äúbest place for it in my opinion‚Äù to another round of applause and laughter. Bride at this point is practically in tears. We cut up what cake wasn‚Äôt on the floor and served it, a few people tried it and most people spat it out. (I later tried the cake and it was like sawdust) the bride kicked out who had ordered in the pizza saying she didn‚Äôt want anyone to eat non vegan food, the rest left to go get McDonald‚Äôs. The bride, groom, and brides mother and father are the only people left as we inform them were closing up. Brides in tears still and the mother just says ‚ÄúI told you it was a bad idea to force people to eat how you want to eat‚Äù \n\nWas all round just a bad day.

I also recall the groom himself, with his small child in one arm, fending off about 4 men while walking up the grand staircase of the castle to escape to his room. Mad.\n\nThe police came and arrested 4 or 5 people and the staff were interviewed as well. The bride was understandably mortified, along with everyone else that had just stood back and watched the action unfold. \n\nIn my experience, every wedding has a few awkward or disappointing moments - which are almost always forgotten or laughed about after.

The second thing that went wrong was all the food was finger food, and the weddding cake was present with mini cupcakes styled in the same way around it, some of this food was laid out and it quickly dissapeared without being restocked, I guess this wasn't supposed to happen until the reception started, some of the 20-30 year olds who had been drinking already at the bar ended up eating all the cupcakes. Since the majority of my family was diabetic, we ended up leaving the reception for a local mcdolands and comming back at the designated time for the reception after the Pictures.\n\nPictures ended up taking close to three hours but the bridesmaids and groomsmen appeared somewhere in the middle of that 3-hour window, I guess they had been drinking prior to the wedding and had continued to do so. They went to the DJ booth and plugged one of the groomsmen's phones into the AUX cable to the speakers, but even with the music only the groomsmen were dancing together with each other in a circle till eventually after some time the bridesmaids ended up joining them. While the cell phone music was playing, one of the groomsmen who was drunk and MCin'g grabbed the mic and introduced the newly wedded couple.  Who came out to applause and to see their wedding party dancing drunk on the floor already, not stopping for their introduction.  \n\n\nthey then went right into their first dance, but the wedding party would not cede the floor, so they took a small corner of the floor and did their dance, with pictures being taken around the wedding party that was still on the dance floor, drunk and trying to rock out. The bride and groom then went around and mingled a bit before they went to do their cake cutting and pictures, only to find that nearly all the cupcakes had been eaten, ruining the professional display.  After that, they cranked up the music and the DJ started to play real songs, we left shortly after. My other cousins told me that after we and the majority of the other people had left, the hotel brought out sandwhiches and a bunch of other food (still all mostly finger food) but that almost all of it went uneaten because people had either already left or the ones who stayed were way to drunk to care about eating anymore.  \n\n\nit was the worst wedding I have ever been to and not a single thing went right (on time, in order, or without disruptions), I could not imagine being my cousin and having good memories of the wedding, it was nearly all monopliozed by the wedding party.",

He made eye contact with me across the room and I slowly shook my head at him. He told them \"no thank you\" to which they protested. Vehemently. He insisted none for him and they pushed it in his face. That's when I stepped in. I told them \"enough. He said no.\" Thry all groaned but that was it.\n\n About a half hour later his creepy uncle was congratulating him for making the right choice. Over. And over. And over. When I saw his hand on my son's leg, I lost my shit a little. I said, \"He gets it. You're very proud  Now that's enough with it.\" As I removed his hand from my son's leg. Creepy uncle was furious. Called me every name in the book and stormed out. I walked the kids to their camper and went back to the reception. Bad idea. Creepy uncle was there again and spittin mad about the whole ordeal with me. I walked in to him getting right in my face yelling about what a terrible mother I am. I stayed cool for awhile, but what with the illicit substances coursing through my inhibitions and all...I eventually succumbed to the inevitable Jerry Springer level fight that was about to ensue. He got too close and poked my chest. I can't handle someone poking my chest. I wrapped my leg around his knee and threw him to the floor. That was the first of many violent acts that night.\n\n At some point my father in law had me pinned to the floor, holding me down like a feral cat, as I whispered in his ear \"do you feel like a big man now?\" He let me up. Also a bad idea. I proceeded to tackle creepy uncle after shoving a box full of mason jars at my despicable mother in law, who was \"protecting\" him by standing between him and me. I just wanted to distract her, not hurt her. She bawled all the next day about it and claimed I sucker punched her in the face. I'm like, \"bitch. If I had punched you, your face would be hamburger. Please.\" I do vaguely remember telling her that if she ever hurt my kids again, I'd relieve her of her hands though. She used to physically abuse my kids when I was stupid enough to send them to her white trashy house alone. Apparently it all came out in my violent rage that night. \n\nI couldn't move for a week afterwards, but successfully made it to work first thing the next morning. I hadn't slept. But I was no longer intoxicated. Just very very sore. My sister in law was mad until the entire story came out. And still.. To this day...No regrets.",

He spent four days in hospital, during which surgeons were unable to re-attach the severed organ, and then he learned that his new bride had left him.\n\nMr Hutchinson, a TSB employee and his wife Shelley, 20, of Craghead, Co Durham, had been invited to celebrate their marriage with another couple. Denise Carr, 29, whose husband Nathan, 32, a fellow TSB supervisor, had missed the Hutchinsons' wedding and threw a party in their honour.\n\nWhile the two women went out for drinks, the men drank three quarters of a bottle of tequila at the flat in Low Fell, Gateshead, Tyneside. When they returned, a quarrel broke out involving all four. Mr Hutchinson attacked his wife and Mrs Carr tried to defend her friend, said Stephen Duffield, prosecuting, at Newcastle Crown Court. It ended with Mr Hutchinson sitting on top of Mrs Carr and she bit him to get him off.\n\nPolice arrived a short time later to find the flat in disarray and found Mr Hutchinson's testicle under a picture frame on the sitting room floor. Mrs Hutchinson said: \"Denise said she knew she had bitten his groin but she didn't know she had done that kind of damage.\"\n\nMr Hutchinson was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, and later transferred to the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle, for surgery. Denise and Nathan Carr, who have two children, were jointly charged with wounding with intent.\n\nThe court accepted her plea of guilty to the lesser offence of affray and the charge was dropped against her husband. Mrs Carr will be sentenced in January.\n\nHer husband said after the hearing: \"It has been a really bad episode for us but we were only trying to help out a friend who was in need.\" Mrs Hutchinson said that she had issued proceedings for divorce against her husband.",

Shots had to be poured into a tumbler with at least one ice cube. Everyone made it work, though.\n\nEventually, the bride ends up in tears. She's drinking by herself in another room. Drunken co-worker half saves the party by getting the mic and singing surprisingly well. A lot of people leave early.\n\nThe kicker? While they were on their honeymoon (with a broken freaking neck,) a hurricane hit our area and dropped a 40ft oak tree directly into their bedroom and soaking their wedding gifts that were being stored there.",

            "text": "A former friend of mine and her now ex-husband‚Äôs wedding went downhill after the ceremony. The wedding party rode in a limo after the ceremony and we all thought we were going to the reception. The bride and groom actually planned on driving around for 3 hours ‚Äúto get their money‚Äôs worth‚Äù of the limo. Our first stop was the cemetery so the bride and groom could have photos taken by the gravestones of family members that have passed. Then, we drive around and the air conditioning in the limo stops working. 10 people crammed into a limo and it‚Äôs the middle of August. It was hot! The bride and groom then want to stop at local bars so the bride can show off her dress (that she had to get a second job to afford). At the first bar, one of the bridesmaids got into a fight with her boyfriend and spent the rest the time crying in the bathroom. We continue to be paraded through different bars for 3 or more hours. Every bar we went into people were buying shots for the bride and groom. By the time we actually were headed back to the reception, we were 2 hours late and the bride and groom were really drunk. \nThe reception was held in a really old hotel not in the greatest area of town and was pretty run down. More guests showed up than were invited. People were getting antsy waiting for the wedding party to show up so they started serving dinner. The wedding was on a budget so the brides family prepared all the food and there was just enough for the invited guests. By the time the wedding party arrived, the food was gone. The wedding party was only able to eat some salad and cake. The venue‚Äôs air conditioning didn‚Äôt work well and the frosting on the cake melted. The bride was too drunk and passed out so the couple didn‚Äôt have their first dance. They brides family still wanted to do the bouquet toss and was going to have the brides matron of honor (her cousin) do it. When the time came, the MoH was MIA. The brides family started to look for her and her husband found her in one of the hotel rooms with one of the wedding guests. The husband and the guest got into a fight and the police were called and they both were arrested. It turns out the MoH had been having an affair via Facebook and they were going to meet up at the hotel.\nThe kicker is the bride and groom invited family on their honeymoon and the MoH (the brides cousin) and her husband still went. Apparently they fought the whole time about the affair. When they got back they got divorced and about 2 years later the bride and groom each had their own separate affairs and are now divorced.",

Hardly anyone showed up for the groom and it was.... uncomfortable looking over at the grooms side and seeing a bunch of empty chairs. I also saw a couple of the grooms guests sneaking something out of a flask when the wedding was a dry event for religious reasons. The coordinator (a church friend of my aunt's) also bungled the entire thing. People weren't where they needed to be, dancing never happened, no one even knew there was a photo booth (that took us days to make and set up), and dinner was super delayed because no one got the bride and groom from pictures post ceremony. They also didn't hire people to run things so it was all my family which meant ~15 of us were working the event instead of enjoying it, which was fine by me but definitely impacted the mood i.e. no one is having fun because all the fun people who know everyone attending are working.\n\nIt was a bummer because it was my aunt's first marriage and she was *so* excited about her wedding and the groom had not been allowed to have any input in his first wedding so he was excited to have a party that he wanted.

It was 2009 and I was an unemployed single mom.  Out of the blue my brother who lives in Colorado calls me to say he is getting married.  I speak to his wife to be briefly but its hard to understand.\n\nI  scraped up the cash anyway to fly from the West Coast to Philly for the wedding after the brides sister called and begged me to.  My family is tiny but someone had to come from the grooms family.  Somehow bride and her family had scraped up the cash to put me up at a nice hotel downtown where the event venue was.  First day,  brides brother scooped me up early in a tiny car with various relatives, my brother, bride to drive all over worn-out Philly.  Met about 100 of brides relatives everyone speaking Swahili and French. Went to dressmaker, random other house, finally to Mom (Matriarch all capitals lol) for dinner. Not a fan of Congolese cuisine but it was obviously a huge deal.\n\n Next day at 11 am my brother gets decked out in Congolese wedding suit. Gorgeous outfit - snow white baggy pants, long white tunic covered in white embroidery and sparkly sequins with a little pill box hat complete with fly whisk 100% Coming to America style. He looked fly!  Banquet hall swarming with absolutely gorgeous women with these amazing handsewn dresses like victorian ballgowns only african prints.  I was gifted a dress like a shift that somehow looked great because these folks sure know how to sew. The room looked like it was packed with enormous butterflies.  Congolese folks got wicked style!\n\n  The ceremony starts and my brother hits me up for $100 which had to be changed for $1 dollar bills.  Ceremony goes on for hours and hours until 11 pm.  All this pageantry.  Brother makes a grand entrance tossing bills to the guests and whisking his whisk. He's the \"big man\".  A chorus of young girls sings and dances.  The bride then makes her appearance in an amazing outfit of gold and red with this crazy flying saucer headdress.  She looks like a goddess.  \n\nMy brother and bride drag out an enormous collection of stuff - new suitcases, clothes, bedding all factory wrapped - and gifts it peice by peice to the Matriarch. Then more singing, speeches, dancing.  Absolutely fabulous and fun. Sweet lovely people but didn't understand a word!\n\nOny other white people are my brothers minister lady and a couple who are non-profit visa attorneys. Found out Matriarch was actually a member of Congolese diplomatic mission.  The entire family's visa situation now in question because  she was dismissed by the embassy.  So  very important high status family in the Congo but on shaky financial footing in the US. \n\nMy brother takes me aside and hits me up for more cash.  Getting through my brothers aspergers is always hard but I finally get that bride is determined to impress her family with her rich husband.  Even if his family is small  brother is a \"big man\" and  will be a great provider for her and their children.  In reality, my brother is a broke ass mobile mechanic living in a garage.  Bride has had a lot of trauma and abandonment, youngest of 10 kids, struggled to get to America, super rickety visa situation, etc etc.  Totally yurgh situation.\n\n I was fuming at my brother but kept my cool because she was so young and with the language barrier she just believed what she wanted to believe.  But even with aspergers my 50+ year old brother should know he was no provider and no way he could support a family.  Bride was pinning her hopes and brother was along for the ride because - I guess he was thinking beautiful girl why not?  The language barrier was only a plus!\n\nAnyhoo, next day another crazy clown car ride to church.  Just lovely lovely people with very little except each other.  Then site seeing on these crazy rotating bus shuttles.  I got lost, missed a shuttle and then left my purse in Liberty Park.  Meanwhile bride starts losing it with my brother as he's trying to find me.  \n\nA good samaritan finds my purse and it has a receipt from the hotel. So after wandering Liberty Park for hours looking for my purse, crying and finally hoofing it back to the hotel - my purse is there!  I can fly home!  \n\nBack at the hotel, bride is furious and loses it on me. Couldn't understand a word but I guess the financial, emotional stress just got to her and I just ruined EVERYTHING. From what I was able to get from my brother was this just one of THREE weddings they had planned. They were already married in a civil service in Colorado but this didn't \"count\".  This first one was just the \"traditional\" Congolese starter wedding. The floofy white gown Christian church one in Philly was next.  Then a big blowout back in Colorado for local freind's.  All expected by the family as my brother was \"rich\".  And to save face this poor girl was paying for all of it with her savings and meager salary cleaning houses.  Talk about pressure! \n\nManaged to make it to the airport and almost missed my plane.  The minister, a truly nice woman, missed hers : (   \nLoved Philly and the lovely Congolese in-laws but could have killed my brother.  Swore I was never going to another of his weddings!\n\nNeedless to say this marriage did not last long and for that I am grateful.  I really hope bride is doing OK.  Really sad to not have a little neice or nephew but I still follow Matriarch on Facebook : )",

            "text": "This happened recently. One of my aunts got married on Saturday. It was at the reception. Apparently, there was an young guy, related to the bride but on her mom's side, was drinking, and got drunk. He ended up going to the girl's bathroom and tried to touch my younger cousins, both young girls and boys. Mind you, the oldest cousin he tried to touch is going to 5th grade, the youngest is around 4.. this guy is 19.\nLuckily, an uncle saw this happening and started yelling at him. More uncles got involved (I have a huge family) and they were yelling at him. One of my cousin's, who was a victim, mom and the bride started crying. His parents were trying to defend him and were saying that he was a 'good kid' but he literally was sent to our home country to get disciplined and he got arrested there. His parents also wanted to avoid the police, so they held him in a chokehold and forced him in the car to leave. \n\nThank god that guy is arrested now.\n\nAlso, some details may not be correct, but the general story happened. We're all in shock and really sad.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSo apparently this whole story was basically wrong lol sorry about that.\nI might keep updating you guys. My fellow older cousins and I are kinda playing detective, so this is a summary of what we think happened, but this is in the point of view of my uncle, who's son was a victim.\nIt's also important to know that all the cousins that are actively trying to put together what happened all weren't there when the fight and when he did these things. We left early. Most of us had a flight the next day, including me.\n\nHeres some background that we collected on the guy:\nHes from a different state, was sent to our home country to get disciplined, then came back. Sometime later when he was 18, he got into a crash for being drunk and on drugs.\n\nSo, this 19 year old guy was dancing with a young cousin of mine, but he was kinda thrusting out his stuff, and that cousin happens to be like 5, so he's really short and all the guy's junk was going on my cousin's head. My cousin's dad/my uncle saw that then told him, \"Hey, I don't really like you doing that, can you stop dancing with my son?\" And this guy was like okay whatever, and keeps drinking. Then the guy gets super super drunk, he was already drunk when he was dancing with my cousin, too. \nThen my uncle walked to the bathroom and saw another cousin of mine, a girl, and she was crying. Her mom/my aunt was with her, too. My uncle asked what's wrong (shes not his kid btw, their kids are cousins) and my aunt said someone was bothering her. He was like huh that's weird. At the time, he didnt think it was the same guy. \nAlso, in between the reception, he walked into the ladies bathroom and there were ladies that kicked him out. During that time, we suspect that he did something to another cousin, and older boy, because he was waiting for his mom in the bathroom. He even once just laid flat on the floor because he was so drunk.\nFinally, there was a big commotion and my uncle went outside to see what was happening. He saw my aunt yelling at that guy. That's when it all clicked for him. The guy grinding on his kid was the same guy bothering my other cousin. At that point, he saw red. Put him into a chokehold, and was about to punch him, but people were holding him back. The hotel staff called the police and he tried to fight the officer, which lead to his arrest. So far, he isn't being held against anything else.\nDuring the fight, the 2 families were arguing with each other and the guy was also fighting with his family. The other family also said that my uncle was just trying to show off his muscles, which is definitely not the case.\nIn short, we know for sure that some underaged guy got super drunk, attempted to touch 2 of our cousins, got in a chokehold by my uncle (who admitted that), his family was defending him, and he got arrested. And this guy also doesnt have a clean record. \n\nThat's our first update reddit, thanks for reading if you got this far. I just wanted to put a little note, especially to all the younger people on reddit, that id anyone does something like this to you, you must tell a trusted adult. This kind of act is criminal. And no one should ever be able to do that to you. I know some people might be scared, or confused, or disgusted with yourself, or something. I cant exactly relate to it, but I think that's kind of the gist of it. But telling someone really does help, because they can help stop the person from doing to others and it can spread awareness. Please respect yourselves more and remember that theres always people who care. Stay safe, everyone!",

            "text": "When I was 19, I attended my friend's wedding as a bride maid. I didn't have high hopes. The couple were only together for 6 months and my friend who was the bride, was the one who proposed. But don't get me wrong, I supported her decision, I knew she was inlove, but I never really liked her fianc√© because he seemed sketchy and only showed affection to my friend if he was bored or if he felt lonely. It was a pretty big wedding. Everything was perfect. A lot of guests, about 100+, singers, a big feast, etc.\n\nWe were all ready. I really liked my dress too. But it was still a long time till the actual wedding would start since the location - in a beach side where the hotel was near - and the bride wasn't done and was still doing her makeup and hair. Since I was the first brides maid to be done I decided to check the place and it was amazing. I helped with the organizers to place some of the chairs and then the groom arrived. I asked him if he was excited and to \"not fuck this up\" in a joke way. He promised me he'll do his best. I left after that to see how the bride was doing since it's going to start in about 30 - 40 minutes. Just then another one of the brides maids that i never really know came out to check the place too. I checked in on my friend and helped her a little. She had a photo shoot and she asked me \"Can you call the groom (not saying his name)?\" since he wasn't there. I checked outside again but he wasn't there. I asked few of the guests where he was and told me they all said they didn't know, they arrived there without seeing him infront. I thought it was weird but tried to find him myself, couldn't find him at all. I even asked the hotel receptionist, nothing. I told the news to my friend and said \"it's okay. He might have went to the bathroom\" and decided to go to go to the wedding. \n\nThe groom was late, he was the only one not there. All the bridesmaids, guests, the pastor, even the ring barer and flower girls were present. Everyone, except him. We started getting worried, I still remember I could see the tears forming on my friends' eyes. And there, fucking hallelujah, he arrived. The only problem was his hair was a little ruffled, the buttons on his clothes weren't even aligned, his tie was loose, but most importantly his cheeks were red. You'd think he was just nervous and blushing but no. He has a pale face, and the only places where he had pinkish red parts were in particular places. But the bride didn't mind, I think me and the other bridesmaids were the only ones that took it in and thought it was really sus.\n\nHere we go - the wedding was done, we were at the reception. Every one was eating, kids were playing, and the singers were having a fun time too. The food was great too. There were some people who left early and one of them were the bridesmaids. Then, after like, 8 minutes after that one bridesmaid left, the groom said he'll go to the bathroom. He hasn't returned in 5 minutes. 10, 15, the bride had enough and asked us to search for him along with her because the dance between the couple was going to start. We searched for him and guess what, is it obvious yet? \n\nWe went into the boys bathroom, and there he was - making out with the bridesmaid, literally almost naked, both of them. My friend went furious and started crying, groom was trying to explain, the bridesmaid was at the back. The girl tried to escape the scene but me, being a furious friend, grabbed the her by the hair and started pulling it. The others started joining too and beat up her up. The bride kept slapping and punching the groom out of anger. Eventually she had enough, went to the reception and started screaming everywhere. She wrecked everything, the food, the tables, everything. Everyone left, even us, and let her do her thing. We explained the situation to everyone and the parents of the bride went furious. Found the groom, beat him up. \n\nEveryone left, the bride wanted to be let alone even if we stayed there to try and comfort her. Up to this day, it was still so vivid and everything was juicy, and fucked up. Been 7 years now, my friend is now a lesbian because she doesn't and never wants to be with a guy ever again.",

There was blood and feathers everywhere. Understandably the bride started crying (quietly into the groom‚Äôs jacket). It went quiet for a while. Everyone was shocked, and it was a really bad omen.
