Every time this happens, the camera has to show Trump's complete and under surprise at the fluke that saves his bacon, immediately followed by his calm reassurance that he expected the fluke and was counting on it.  Trump haters look forward to him failing every episode, only to be frustrated and tune in for, \"Next week, Trump faces...\" just *knowing* that he'll get his comeuppance next week.  Trump supporters tune in to watch his 4-dimensional chess moves.\n\nThe key to the broad audience is that nobody (with Trump himself being the possible exception) loves Trump as much as lots of people love hating Trump.  All the people who listened to Rush Limbaugh to get angry because they were *sure* he was wrong about everything, will tune in.\n\nToward the middle or end of the season, the outcomes have to get more ambiguous, where the fluke only sort of saves Trump from his decisions.  The ambiguity is what gets season two funded.",

Personally, I can think of much better presidents than what I’m naming, but sure, here’s mine and why:\r  \n\r  \nTruman - competent management of the end of WWII through the Korean war. Good management of the Marshall Plan and Berlin Air Lift. Generally the economy did well under him AFTER 1946. The economy suffered a recession in 1946 (GDP fell 11%!!!) as a result of the war ending and budget cuts.\r  \nBill Clinton — Again, competent management. Ran a budget surplus that was more related to dot com bubble and Y2K investment spending. Limited military involvements… rode the economic high very well. A+ on the economics side.\r  \nLBJ — Introduced Medicare. Improvements to social programs, ‘Great Society’, and civil rights. Good overall economy performance. Bad handling of foreign affairs keeps him from placing higher\r  \nBarack Obama — recovery from the ‘Great Recession’. Saved the US auto industry and Detroit as well. First black President. Introduced Universal Health Care to the US. Excellent International relations with other members of G-19 (not Russia). Inspiring to some, divisive to others.\r  \nEisenhower — Competent Management, economy grew most of the years he was president.\r  \nThose are my top five. Honorable Mentions go to George H. W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, and JFK.\r  \n\r  \nMost over-rated president: Ronald Reagan.\r  \n\r  \nMost incompetent president: WE ARE LIVING WITH HIM RIGHT NOW!",

I suggest that they should split it and he should come up with half of the money in case he is loosing. So he agreed to it.\n\nFYI we all live in Germany, i consider both of my cousins not really smart. Both anti-vaxx.\nBut hey, I tried my best to convince him and teach him about vaccination last year and it still didn't work. \nNow he offers me free money and i told him I will accept the bet, maybe he is going to learn and understand if he looses money.",

This involves faking a lot of stuff - if you have seen those old time MI episodes you know what I mean. If you haven’t, recall the scene in the latest movie where they set up a hospital room with fake news about nuclear attack to con the detainee. It is similar to that but way more complex.\n\nHowever, in the process, they must also convince Trump to complete something that will in reality massively discredit him for his followers.

Losing half of the world's love.\n\nSo what does Trump decide? Take the statue and lose the money, take the money and lose the statue or take neither and keep both groups' affection?",

But Trump finds clues that \"Biden\" still is sneaking around the White House. He can never prove it.\n\nMia Rudolph plays \"Kamala Harris\". This is obvious even to Trump, but everyone insists its Kamala. She is both Trump's foil and saving grace during ongoing shenanigans.\n\nHe has a personal assistant played by three attractive women and one unattractive woman (they look similar from far away). The unattractive only appears when alone with Trump.\n\nMost days are very easy crises for Trump to overcome. Large ridiculous meetings are called setting up Trump to solve the non-problem of the day. Trump gives press conferences where odd things happen. Big tech gives into him, but there is always some scenario of silliness inspiring his replsponse. At some point, Trump is groundhog day'd.\n\nThe new \"President of Russia\" and \"Prime Minister of Israel\" are reoccurring characters. Many of his supposed advisors call daily all keeping him in the show.\n\nThe main storyline consists of Trump getting acclimated to \"Biden's\" staff and the \"Biden\" trial and subsequent sneaking around the Whitehouse.\n\nDem Congress then spats with Trump. Trump is early on fooled into shutting down the government, which because of a Biden era rule means Trump cannot leave the Whitehouse. This goes on most of the 2021-2022. \n\nRepublicans win big in 2022 with a 100% Trump takeover of the party priorities, but are shown to be comically inept. They often are fooled into inacting Democrat favored policies. Trump finds out he's signing bills that destroy his business. Republicans do manage to replace some of \"Biden\" staff with Trump yes men that are helpless against the deep state.\n\nRepublicans manage to give Trump a chance for a third term. Which sets up the campaign for relection versus: \"AOC\" (again an obvious parody that everyone plays along). This time the polls have him way ahead, until \"AOC\" changes course and becomes a knockoff version of his campaign.\n\nIn the end, they tie and Congress chooses Trump with AOC as VP.

I'd go in hard like fuck someone up. Lose my job episode 1\n Itd be like Oprah or someone right. Ep 1. Right off the bat- Oprah... \n \nPicture this. She's waking up in her château, puffy eyes and everything seems fucking fantastic cause thats what her 'fine' is. Shes deciding whether she should call her robot butlers up for breakfast or have her other robot butlers whisk her bed down for it, when in walks who else but the queen of fucking england by her little old self. Like you'll, Oprah's in shock so she checks to see if she's dreaming. She's not...What happens next really really fucks with her brain. The queen walks up to her And sucker punches Oprah right square in the face. She's out like a light. \n\n(I shout 'cut'. Crew comes our and high fives the queen on a good scene. )\n\nNext thing Oprah knows she wakes up in the same place at her château in bed. Remembering what went down, she goes out to talk to her staff and security. They're in on the prank tho. So what we've done, we've replaced every one of them with Russian speakers. The maids, chefs,  gardeners etc. They're all trying to convince her she lives in russia. She thinks she's going crazy. The queen of england and now this? She's gotta get out of here so she calls her Russian chauffeur and tells him to drive her to the nearest police station. As they get out of her château estate she's even more shocked to find herself in the middle of what seems to be a Russian town. Wtfff? (Part of the prank is that we built the exact same château estate in Russia and put her in it after the Queenie knocked her tf out.) She finds that the police all speak Russian and are unhelpful. All the contacts on her phone are Russians. She's even texted many of them for years it seems. She can't find her passport and the police tell her she never had one and has lived here all her life. She's a very wealthy local who was rumored to have lost her mind. Dejected and possibly terrified, she goes back home. She's desperate to get to the US now so she goes online to book a ticket. Destination 'Los Angeles'. Error: 'destination doesn't exist. ' She's like wtf? So she checks SF and NYC and Boston. Turns out, the US doesn't exist at all. A ride to the local airport proves the same. (We've actually taken charge of her internet via Lan and removed all references to the US and arranged it with the local airport. Its Oprah, after all. Big episode bro). Now she's gotta reckon with the fact that she's actually mental and dreamed of a place called the US and a life in English. She may have been in a coma and woke up speaking English? She goes home and contemplates suicide. We give her just enough dopamine in treats and drug form to make sure she chooses to stay alive. (Episodes gottsta be epic.) Three days go by before she decides to step outside the house again. We've been watching her using cameras inside the house the whole time. She's been sobbing going crazy classic denial you know. Today it looks like she's finally getting past it. She's decided to go out and learn a bit about herself. She still doesn't believe it. 2 weeks pass. 3, 4. We wait for her to break. Oprahs a lot stronger than we thought. But we could see her breaking down day after day. The 5th week, 35 days in, she wakes up and finally decides she's had enough. Sitting up in bed, she purposefully gives in to her identitiy-less life. She becomes no one. She accepts it. And in that acceptance, she breaks through. Ego death. She closes her eyes. The fundamental transformation of her psyche makes her transcend the self and become one with all. Right at the height of her transcendence, a light comes on in her room. Through squinted eyes, Oprah can just make out a shadow. It looms. Comes closer. Suddenly, the queen. She jumps up on to the bed, screams 'You got punk'D!!!' and bam. Knocks mid transcendence Oprah right out again. \n\nThen we put her back in her own château her in the US, and pretended it never happened. Its been 3 years and to this day, she hasn't told a soul. We haven't told her either. Some of the crew still get together and laugh about it.",
