So I asked my friend if he didn't mind doing it as I had a few other mics to set up and the owner said \"no, I asked you\". \n\nOne month in, my friend had been promoted twice and became his right hand man while there were two other females who had been there longer deserving of promotions. \n\nThe things he said were incredibly underhanded sexist.\n\nHe also made me drive 3 hours to an event because he didn't have his \"special\" mic. I told him that my friend should be leaving soon to the event they can take it and he told me \"I asked you and I need it\".\n\nIn the beginning, I didn't think anything of it but obviously regretted staying in that position until I wasn't taking his sh*t anymore and eventually replaced.",

We both geeked out hard discussing the sort of parameters and reports that could drive up the general understanding of who was using the business, how they were making money, and how to make more. \n\nLegit we were both bouncing in our seats yelling, \"Yeah yeah yeah! And also...!\"\n\nHe called me an hour and a half later to exclaim he had returned to work super jazzed and decreed to the big boss that he HAD to hire me. I had an interview with the big boss the next day, but consider it a formality!\n\nThe writing was on the wall the moment I walked in. \n\nI did my best, brought up the points I had the day before, how it could raise profits, added on the other points I'd thought of the night before... and he smiled and nodded and thanked me for my time and told me they would totally call me, sure thing, any day now, thanks for coming in and I was dismissed. \n\nOn my way out I saw the IT fella. He told me how excited he was to get started on our database when I started. \n\nAre you fucking serious? LOOK around you. You have 20 male coworkers and 5 female coworkers. Out of the 5 female coworkers, not a single one is over 22. Not a single one less than 5'10\". Not a single one weighs more than 115lbs. \n\nAnd the worst part is that probably at least one of those young ladies fucking rocked at her job, and nobody fucking noticed because thats not why she got hired. \n\nBut somehow this bright fella worked in a place like that and literally thought it was *a total coincidence* that the women he worked with were all ex models.",

Phone their customer service line and ask to be transferred to recruitment (or make a general sales/query call) ; I say this with all the respect in the world, having started my career on the dialer, but being able to handle a call well is simply a matter of effective and consistent coaching, if you get crappy service, its a major red flag.\n2. Can you contact a named person handling your recruitment case through email / phone? if your given just a generic email box (providing they don't have a decent ATS/CRM that is picking up your emails and queuing them to your advisor)  I'd run for the hills.\n3. If you get directed instantly to a website without the person your speaking to (even a general sales bunny) offering to talk you through the company, i'd run for the hills.\n4. and as so many have mentioned, time to think / discuss post an offer being made; my jump to a new industry was a bit hell-ish mid covid, the company I ended up joining was a 6 month process due to a hiring freeze at the time, however, throughout I was kept in the loop by a named individual and when it came time for an offer, I had already done the math and knew the number i'd need to make it work, the guy was so surprised that I accepted within the hour he said he would let me sleep on it and phone me in the morning.

He knew my education and I was clearly not good enough to his standards.\n\nIn the same room there was the technical lead for the job I interviewed for. The manager turned to him and said 'I'm done here, do you have any questions?' And he went on to serve me a series of technical questions. Granted I knew very little of what he asked.\n\nI got like 10 questions where I could only answer 4 instantly, the other 6 I analyzed the problem out loud, listened to the lead's input and came to the correct answer. At a certain point he looked at his manager, back to me and again at his manager. The lead nodded to the manager and looked back to me and said: \"You know very little of the theory, but the way you analyze a problem...you're extremely good at it!\"\n\nI got the job. I declined. The lead called me, I explained why I declined. The manager called me and I told him that his behavior when he heard my qualifications is the reason why. Told him I learned from it and I hope he did to. He was silent...so I said goodbye and hung up.\n\nMy current job required the same qualifications. My lead put a technical case they where struggling with before (they solved it, but it took 6 months) in front of me. I knew jack shit, same technique, reasoned out loud, asked questions, reasoned some more and got the solution in less then 10 minutes of back and forth. I did not get hired because I solved it, (he knew the solution, so he knew answers to certain questions they did not know when they struggled with the issue.) but because I reasoned out loud and he heard the way how I analyze a problem.\n\nLast weeks evaluation after 6 months: \"You function like someone that's been working here for multiple years.

Employers sometimes include the value of their benefits package and other things in their advertised compensation ranges.\n* High Management Turnover:  If managers and supervisors are rapidly turning over, it's a bad sign.  Ask the manager you are interviewing with how long they've been there and how long have they been in that position.\n* Organization size:  The larger the size of the organization, the more predictable it is.  You'll be able to get more information either online or through folks that work/ed there.  Smaller organizations can be awesome to work for, but sometimes it's hard to figure out what it's like to work there - especially for single-owner businesses.",

            "text": "From personal experience coming out of college (Mechanical Engineering Degree) this was hands down red flag galore.\n\nThis was my 2nd real Engineering Job Interview so I  told myself see it through because I need the interviewing experience and they reached out to me for an entry level design engineering position.\n\nThey made me wait for 15 minutes in a not heated breezeway in the middle of winter.\n\nA receptionist came out 5 minutes into me waiting in the cold and asked would I need to give a 2 week notice to my current job or can I start this week. I gave a non-answer and I thought that was also my invitation in and she said that the person was not ready yet and I had to continue to wait.\n\nWhen I finally was greeted by the manager I'd work under, he was new to the company (2 months at the time) he made sure I knew that for some reason, they first asked a standard tell me about yourself, then pivoted to pay saying look I understand what you might expect in terms of compensation but please hear us out before you make your decision (weird that was not something I mentioned in my \"get to know me pitch\")\n\nWe do a quick tour and by quick I meant 2 minutes, no workers looked up from their areas as we passed through and you could hear a pin drop it was that silent. \n\nNext the place is old, inside the \"work area\" everything looked like it was bought in the 80s, the manager casually drops, so when you first pull into the office leave your cell phone in your car because having it go off at your desk is grounds for termination, if something is that important give your family the number for the receptionist and they can forward a call to you if you are not busy. Anyway follow me the owner wants to meet with you.\n\nThe owner is in his 70s and the son of the founder of the company, his personal story was nice but after the get to know you stuff (no technical questions) he slides a folder across the table and says quit your job today, start tomorrow and I'll give you $2000, inside is a break down of their policies (2 highlights: Doctors visits and funerals are unexcused absences unless you take vacation for them, you are not allowed to be more than 15 minutes late twice in a calendar year or you are subject to termination)and pay, the amount for salary was blank, so I asked about it.\n\nHe stares down the manager (who looks like he saw a ghost at this point) and asks \"what do you think is fair\"\n\nI asked for a market rate for pay given my education and the position and they countered with a significantly lower number (more than 25k/yr less than my market value ask) saying \"We are glad to pay you that amount at a later date but you need to go through training and on-boarding. While doing that you aren't actually doing all the responsibilities of this role and on boarding takes 6 months so we can negotiate a more reasonable salary then but for now this is our offer”\n\nI said I understand there are costs for training but what does that entail to justify the pay, he said to learn the company you need to start from the bottom your first 6 months you'll be in the warehouse loading and unloading product from semi trailers.\n\nI thought he was joking, he was not.\n\nI immediately said thank you I need to think this over and walked to the door, the owner half blocks the door and says if you leave now you're ruining you future, you don't understand this opportunity will set you up for life if you're willing to make sacrifices. I say I'll call you tomorrow and leave. This entire process lasted 45 minutes on a first interview.\n\nI get home and have an email from the owner saying how dare I leave the interview, if I had any level of experience they'd start me closer to my desired pay, I am making the worst decision of my life by not taking this job...etc\n\nI get a phone call about an hour later from the manager saying look I understand you may have reservations but if you come in tomorrow I can give you another $500. I hung up and that was that.\n\nThis place tried to get me a recent engineering grad to take a warehouse job that was pitched as the training program to become an engineer at nearly half the market rate for an engineer out of college, one that said they'd fire you for having a cell phone in the building and that god forbid you have to go to a funeral you need to take a vacation day.\n\nSo what is a red flag you might not realize \n\nLiterally anything I just said\n\nE: caught some spelling errors\n\n[Found some of the rules from their policy sheet pretty sure number 4 is illegal](https://imgur.com/a/DP7Uq3A)",

            "text": "This is such a good question.  Here are some thoughts- and for context I've started several companies, hired a lot of people, and consequently spent a lot of time thinking about how to develop positive cultures.\n\n-The CEO/boss/whatever drives a conspicuously expensive car.  I can elaborate why this is a tell if anyone cares.\n\n-If it's a private/family company, do a Google search for '[company name] defendant' and '[company name] plaintiff'.  If the company has been sued, or is in the habit of suing others, that can be a red flag- although something there are legit reasons for either.  But it's something worth paying attention to.\n\n-If when you are asked to come in for an interview, you are not treated with total respect for your time- for example, if you find yourself waiting for extended periods for an interview because 'so and so is in a really important meeting'.  Similarly, if you are not offered at least water and/or coffee if you're in for several interviews.  I once interviewed at a place for seven straight hours with no break, no food, not even a glass of water.  Fortunately I wasn't offered the job as it was at Michael Milken's firm... before he went to prison.  \n\n-If the company brings alcohol into the office for 'end of week' sessions on a regular basis.  I know they can be fun but it's a stupendously bad idea for all kinds of reasons and if leadership hasn't figured that out then I'd think twice before joining.  \n\n-If when you're visiting the company for the first time and you pass someone in a hallway, do they smile and acknowledge your presence with a nod or maybe a hello, or do they ignore you?  It's a small thing but very telling about the workplace culture.  Similarly, do people seem 'healthy and energized' or 'grey-faced and tired'?  \n\n-ANY 'bait and switch' deviations from representations made during the recruiting process vs actual terms/conditions.\n\n-If it's a job in a manufacturing or distribution facility, is it messy or tidy?  Messy, cluttered facilities are indicative of poor management, plus they can be dangerous. \n\n-As others have noted, any B.S. about 'oh people like to work late' or stuff like that used as pressure to get you to put in extra hours.\n\n-Last, pay attention to your gut feel.  If something feels 'off', it probably is.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the nice comments, and for those who disagree, well, I'm just sharing my perspective.  I'm pasting in my answers to a couple of follow-up questions re cars and beer:\n\nRe cars: There are obviously exceptions, but in my experience leaders who are focused on the external indicators of their personal success will orient their behavior and decisions towards their own benefit versus benefiting the entire company and/or other employees. In more extreme cases- which unfortunately are not uncommon- these people tend towards the narcissistic personality type, which means they will tend set their direct reports against each other rather than encouraging and fostering collaboration and display other behaviors that make for a miserable workplace. I know, kind of a big leap from a fancy car... but I've been at this for almost 40 years and it's amazing how patterns tend to repeat.  And for clarity I'm really talking about 'conspicuously' expensive- not a nice Mercedes or whatever, but a Bentley, Ferrari, that sort of thing.\n\nRe alcohol: So.... as someone noted elsewhere, sometimes these can be good/useful/fun. In fact, they start that way when companies are small- and I used to do them regularly. But... here's why I stopped doing them. In a group of 100 (actually, a lost less than that) or more, you're going to have some folks with alcohol-management issues. So you're creating a company-sponsored regular event in which they have the choice of either not participating- and thereby missing out on the networking etc- or being in an environment where everyone is drinking. And for those who haven't figured out they have an alcohol problem, you're basically helping them pre-game for the evening. I've seen people knock back three beers in 20 minutes... and then realized they will be driving home. Is it my responsibility to ensure they don't drink too much? No. But is it a good idea for me to enable it? And, finally... for those who think I'm a prude or whatever... if it's your company, you regularly provide alcohol at company events, everyone knows old Bill often hits it a bit hard before heading home, and Bill happens to kill someone on his drive, you are completely, unutterably fucked. Quite aside from the whole 'gee am I partly responsible for what happened' guilt thing, the family of the person killed will get a contingent litigator and they will come after you for literally everything you have- easily $20 million or more per person.",

I went in Monster.com and found an advert saying that they were looking for teachers for gifted children, but that I needed to take an online IQ test to apply (needed an IQ above 125 to go for an interview). I took the test, sent in my CV and cover letter, and waited. An hour later I get an email asking to meet at a special cafe in downtown Melbourne the following day.\n\nSo, I go and notice that this building was a Free Mason building and that one needed a special pass to get in. There was a little older lady waiting for me in a tacky floral print shirt and a white fisherman's hat. Immediately, she pardoned herself for wearing that hat, explaining that it was lined with aluminum to protect her from the cell phone radiation. I think nothing of it and order a coffee.\n\nOff the bat, the old lady tells me about how she has an IQ of 160 and the rarest blood type, similar to that of Tutankhamen... She goes on and on about this for a while and then begins explaining the job. She tells me that in the beginning, I wouldn't be teaching but administering tests in schools around Queensland to recruit children to special camps, where then I would be teaching.\n\nThe whole thing screamed red flags, but I politely listened and got her business card if ever I had further questions (I got a proposal on the spot). I looked at the card and it said \"The wise ones\". After looking it up, I noticed that it was a cult (similar to that of Universal Medicine)",

You’ll work there a year or two and once the company has sales where they need to be or if the product is failing they will sell the product to a larger company. The whole time the will lie and say your job is safe then one day they schedule a national call on a Friday afternoon and fire everyone. Either way you will be out of a job very soon.\n\nI thought of one more. If the company cancels the presidents club trip altogether or gives cash instead of a vacation with upper management (who of course all go for free as well) they are selling the company. \n\nOverall don’t get into this industry. It is absolutely nothing like people think. You buy the doctor’s staff Jason’s deli and educate the doctor about the drug. There is no wine and dine.

            "text": "I remember like, 5 years ago I was real hard-up for a job, and I'd be going out every single day hitting up like 3-5 interviews every day for months. I went to over 100 and didn't get anything... it took an emotional toll on my health, both mental and physical.    \n\n\nI managed to get an interview at this super high-end place in downtown, and I had an interview that went super well with the manager. She sent me an e-mail that day telling me they were going with other candidates, so I asked him if she wouldn't mind giving me feedback on why I wasn't getting jobs because I'd been to classes, I'd had my resume professionally done, I have tons of 5 star reviews floating around in the ether - I'm exceptional at what I do, but for whatever reason employers just don't like me. Is it the way I look? is it my voice? am I too gay? I just can't take the rejection anymore.    \n\n\nShe wrote me an extremely detailed list about what I was doing wrong in interviews and why I didn't get the job. Basically, I grew up in the 80's and 90s, so we were told to \"sell yourself\" or \"don't take no for an answer\" or \"fake it til you make it\", but that advice hasn't really aged well. She told me that an interview should be a conversation, not a sales pitch (Flying in the face of everything I'd been told for years). You should have questions, you should be confident and **both the interviewer and interviewee should spend an equal amount of time talking.** She told me I seemed like a lovely person, and she was impressed by my resume, but she said I took up about 70% of the interview talking about myself, and that was a red flag.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoing forward, I took that advice and it has only served me well. In any business relationship, or working with clients, or applying for other jobs I always make sure *it's a conversation*, not a sales-pitch or a *presentation*. I went to apply for a job a few months ago - I have a job, I was just looking for a side hustle to supplement my income, and the manager talked AT me for about 20 minutes. He didn't ask me many questions, just told me about his vision, and the company philosophy and his dream for the future etc. etc. etc. And after 30 minutes of me just going \"un huh, yeah, totally. Oh yeah, for sure. Yep. Oh, agree. Oh yeah, 100 percent\" he put his hand out and was like \"so, think you can get on board with a vision like that? (he basically just said they're \"a family here\" and it's \"not your typical job - we want everyone to succeed, and our vision is based on 30+ years of international experience and networking, blah blah blah, we don't take holidays because we love this job too much, but we still get non-negotiable time off every week, nobody is overworked, and we don't tolerate negativity in the workplace blah blah blah).  I shook his hand, and told him I'd let him know. I texted him an hour later telling him I'd pass.  By the end of the interview he barely knew my name, hardly checked my resume, didn't ask me anything relevant to the job. He just wanted to sell himself, so I knew this was a stunt.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: If your boss / employer only talks about themselves without ever having a conversation with or listening to their employees, that is the foundation for toxicity in the workplace. Pretty much every boss I've ever had that mansplained things or only talked about themselves, ended up being a nightmare.**",

At the end of the day, the business is there to make money, and if you are too concerned with not hurting your \"family\" and less concerned about making things efficient, shit hits the fan real quick. Where I work right now we have like 4 or 5 people that are alcoholics or come in to work high every day, they barely are able to do their job and most of the time the rest of us have to work harder to help pick up the slack and do some of their job, which pisses everyone else off since we don't get compensated for it. Yet management is too scared to fire anybody because they don't want to hurt their family and want everyone to be happy. Well, unfortunately no matter what people will be unhappy. Might as well treat us like a team and not be afraid to fire useless employees so they can at least keep the productive employees happy. \n\nI will say, I worked for a guy once who cut me a check for 50k of his own money, not company money, to help my family out in a hard time because he knew what I was going through and wanted to make sure I was able to help my real family. He didn't expect anything back, though I did pay him back eventually, but he just did it because I needed help and he was a good man. *that* is what a real work family does. They show family through their actions, not tell people we are a family to get extra work without pay.",

They are usually paid incrementally.  For a $1000 bonus you might get $250 after orientation, $250 at 6 months and $500 at 1 year.  Often there are conditions to meet: no call off, tardies or disciplinary action, which is difficult for anyone to meet after a year.  Also, your bonus payment will be taxed heavily- 30-40%.  So a $1000 bonus becomes $650ish.  Divide that by the hours you expect to work that year and you’ll see it’s almost nothing.  40hrs/week X 50 weeks= 2000 hours.  2000/$650= $3.07/hour.",

I nearly walked away saying “good luck with your business” right then and there, but the following week I had requested for an employment contract which the boss absolutely REFUSED; This being a legal issue, and raised a huge red flag. \nI continued to work there for a few weeks until I found a much better job with a better company that paid me wayyy more!

I feel like another big red flag would be replacing a family member of the company. In this scenario, the boss was extremely controlling of me and began to treat me as his daughter (SUPER WEIRD AND ANNOYING!!). He expected so much more out of me than what was realistic, and belittled me constantly.\n\nBig red flag: “family run company” ESPECIALLY if it’s a real small company (less than 10 employees). \n\nLast one: Banked overtime hours instead of overtime pay. This is how they get away with paying you less for more of your time (and NEVER allow you take your holiday/banked hours off). \n\n**Boss also forced me to work on Xmas day.

Often this means they aren't going to invest in proper infrastructure which will make your life more difficult.\n\n9 They push you to start earlier or as soon as you can.\n\n10 Preinterview is short, e.g. 5 minutes and the person doing the actual interview doesn't know the information you already told the first person.\n\n11 The interviewer cuts the interview at the time and won't go over.\n\n12 The interviewer won't talk about their experiences at the company and impressions.\n\n13 They want you to take a company car before your probation period is over.\n\n14 Expenses for travel are to be handled by you and the company will refund you at the end of the month.

Key thing I'd add is always ask for feedback at the end of an interview, and if they can't provide any then have some doubts. Even if its basic like they're happy or they have questions. If they can't do that then either they weren't paying attention and you're just ticking a box, or they don't undwthe company and it's business which risks you being hired for something you aren't expecting.",

If they have a 2 year employment contract. That means you have to pay a lot of money to quit your job. Some contracts don't require you to pay if you are moving X amount of miles away. \n\n3. Are there are senior nurses still working there? If there aren't, that means a few things. They might cap pay or cap PTO/vacation hours, meaning the hospital doesn't bother retaining experienced nurses. This could also mean poor staffing. There is a certain amount of staff required for safe body mechanics when moving a patient. Older nurses won't stay somewhere that expects you to move an obese or bed bound person on your own. \n\n4. What is the turnover rate? If the average nurse isn't making it more than 1.5-2 years, look elsewhere.  This could also mean insufferable management, complete disregard for labor laws (unsafe staffing, working without breaks), workplace aggression from other nurses/doctors/management, and no safety measures or consequences for violent patients.\n\n5. You want a union. TRUST ME. \n\n6. Do the nurse to patient ratios actually match the recommended ratios set by the ENA?\n\nThere is a nationwide nursing shortage.

We hired in a fashion design student with some Adobe creative suite experience to be a customer service rep at a printing company after the senior CSR dipped. They didn't get her in before his two weeks were up, so I was left juggling his job and mine simultaneously, and then needed to train someone new who wasn't experienced in commercial printing.  \n\n\nI'd trained many people like that before, so it wasn't a huge issue, but we also had a really badly out-of-date ordering system that was barely hobbling along, and it made the learning curve for the customer service portion very steep. On top of that, she onboarded on a Thurdsday, and it was the week that I had been covering our billing person as well, as she'd had a vacation planned from before the senior CSR left.  \n\n\nSo I was juggling three jobs simultaneously, and was handed an inexperienced new employee for training. Unsurprisingly, I had very little time for her, and every time I spent an hour or so training her, I fell behind on processing orders for production, which put stress on everyone. I still put in a little time each day, but it was incredibly stressful, and I was miserable.  \n\n\nBy the following Tuesday, the President had decided that he had made a mistake in hiring her, and fired her. After three days, all of which I was too busy to actually spend serious time training her. On top of that, they started grumbling at me that I was taking too long on order processing, and that they didn't understand why the senior CSR had been able to train me while working solo, but I couldn't train her (I onboarded as one of the most experienced people in their entire shop, and they had hired me specifically to fast track me to management before the senior CSR quit; the only thing he had to train me on was their horseshit ordering system, AND he'd only been doing his own job at the time).  \n\n\nI put in my two weeks that Friday with nothing lined up to take its place (ended up taking a marketing position that started 3 days after my 2 weeks ended). Last I heard from a buddy over there, the entire company was in a tailspin as the middle management people desperately tried to take on my position. They'd been trying to move out of the building and into a new, cheaper location, and all of their plans had to go completely out the window because the structure of the company was crumbling as the rats jumped ship.",

They actually withheld information on both the title and all of its duties until after I accepted. It basically meant I was the only person in charge of an entire section of the store. I pulled from the back stock, pushed what came in on the truck that day, backstocked what wouldn't go on the shelves, had to make sure the area wasn't a complete mess, and anytime we had to switch merchandise around I had to do that too, which meant rearranging shelves and hooks and finding space for the old stock that would now be on clearance. Basically it was an excessive amount of work for 1 single person to do,especially when I spent half my shift unloading the truck every morning.\n\nI joked with my team lead that Designated Business Owner was just a fancy title for people to feel better about doing a fuckton of work without getting a raise, but God knows if I said that joke around HR I'd be in deep shit",

If you’re looking for a new job and you don’t need to leave your current one, I’d ask what the average raise was within the company over the past year.  Inflation is sitting somewhere between 5.5-7%. If they gave less than that on average you’re dealing with a company out to nickel and dime you.  If it’s a 10-20% raise up front to start that’s great, but if you want it to be somewhere to grow your career you better be aware of the little things.  \n\n\nI say that coming from a company that does almost nothing for their employees but gave everyone company wide an 11% raise to make up for inflation and no raises the previous year.  I’m at an s&p500 company and see the forecast of inflation built into our p&l’s.  So kinda hard to say let’s factor in 5.5% inflation and then give everyone a 3% raise.

I kept messing up here and there and they would get mad and kick me off the machine and just have me clean up the shop for 12 hours....a few days go by and i get the hang of working the machine and then they throw me on a different machine, same thing i shadow a person then i try. I mess up and they get mad and kick me off and have me cleaning outside in the rain for 12 hours. \n\nI told em they have to give me some time i cant perfectly operate thier machinery just by watching someone else. \"Well its sink or swim over here, you either get it or you dont\" \n\nI told them thats a terrible excuse for not knowing how to train your employees, no wonder you cant keep people here. You expect them to do things perfect the first try and thats not how us humans work. I did not come back. I went to my temp office and talked to the person handling my assisngments and told them what was up.

If there are too many principals and too many interns it generally means they just shit out crap made by poorly managed recent grads who move on as fast as possible because the work environment is toxic.\n\n* Office is all men.  I've worked at two and interviewed at multiple, the people and work may be decent enough but inevitably the culture becomes toxic.  The longer an office stays all male the harder it becomes to hire women too.\n\n* I learned to turn down offers from sole proprietors.  That one person dominates the office's culture and rules, unless you know them and know they are good at their job and have a decent business sense it can quickly and easily turn into a disaster.  I've worked for one who had an anger management issue, not setting him off made communicating problems impossible.  I also worked for one whose management style was \"make vague demands and get annoyed when things didn't work out the way he pictured in his head [but didn't express]\".\n\n* The ad for the job is unclear about the job responsibilities of the position.  It usually means they haven't figured that out, it can be great if you want to jump into a small office and do everything (that's how I started) but a lot of people cannot handle that environment or unclear expectations.  If they aren't specific it means they just need a body and don't know what to do with it.\n\n* Depending on what you're looking for in a job it helps to search a firm before applying.  If they have just won a big project they are likely staffing up just to do that and will dump you after.  They will say that if you excel there is a chance you could keep your job but in my experience that's extraordinarily unlikely.  I've know firms with 2-4 principals and 1-2 support staff that will balloon up to 20 for a big project and never retain anyone between those projects no matter what they promise.\n\n* No salary range provided.  They will just go for the lowest number they see and assume people won't do salary research (I've been involved in hiring before, people don't do research, don't be those people)",

During the first two interviews they pretty much dodged all my in-depth-questions about what the project i'll be working in will be about. After the 4th interview they finally told me what they expected. They wanted me to validate internal data that isn't allowed to be cited publicly... which is a problem, since - you know - getting a PhD requires publishing papers (at least where i live). Additionally they told me that the project i would be working in already started in august 2020 and is going to end in febuary 2024. So i would have had exactly two years of time to complet all the required experiments and gathere all the data needed, without any preparation time whatsoever. For a complex PhD topic that is very, very little time (the average completion time for a PhD is 4.5 years where i live). Oh and to top it off, they wanted me to write an in depth exposè about the research topic within a few days after passing the second interview without having access to any of their ressources. They also expected me to do about one and a half months of unpaid literature research upfront, before the job even officially started. \n\nAnd they were bold enough to be surprised when i declined the position. Yes, not many people are being accepted into such positions, but even getting your Dr-title at a globally well known brand isn't compensation enough for how awful they'll treat you during your \"journey\" to get there.\n\nTo keep it short and get back to the topic. Red flags:\n\n- refusing to communicate details about your future job and not clarifying expectations upfront\n\n- expect you to do (a lot of) unpaid work upfront",

I've come to view it as a test, not so much to see what you can do, but how much you're willing to be exploited.\n\nThere is never an excuse to ask someone to come in and take the time to work a shift and help your business earn money and then not compensate them for that fact. I also think that it's probably illegal, though I haven't looked into the particulars. If someone asked me to do a working interview now without compensation, I would walk out of the interview. I worked in the service industry for fifteen years and I thought this was normal for a long time, but I have since radically changed my view.\n\nThere's so much exploitation in that industry. I've worked for so many people who try to make it seem downright noble to be willing to work a twelve hour shift and only eat your meals over a garbage can while you're waiting for your tables to check out or your food to come into the window. News flash: it's not noble. It's exploitation. At the end of the day, you're probably not going to get so much as a thank you. In fact, you'll probably be told that no one needs to thank you for you just doing your job. It's real fucking convenient that the people who stand to profit from exploiting you are the ones who get to decide that your willingness to be exploited is a good quality in a person.\n\nAlso, there's the matter of the break waiver. I would never work at a job again that told me I had to sign a break waiver to work there. Having the option to force people to sign a break waiver or you won't hire them is kind of defeating the purpose of having the laws in the first place that are supposed to protect them from this type of expectation.\n\nHas anyone else noticed that the harder you have to work, the more you get treated like shit?

In other words, someone breaks into your house and steals the company laptop, they’re taking the cost out of your paycheck. \n\n* You consent to a search of all your property… and it specifies this includes your car, bags, etc.. and it specifies who can do this like company security and maybe actual law enforcement….. but they fail to limit it to “while on company property” or something. In other words, selective specificity. Oh, you were actually on the public road outside the parking lot when we stopped you? Well, the agreement doesn’t say where…\n\n* Completely illegal wage shit like when a staffing agency says they won’t pay you if your hours aren’t approved by the client and/or they won’t pay you until the client pays them.\n\nThese are all giant red flags telling you you are not on equal footing, they are going to take advantage of you at every turn, and they think the law is something scary to threaten workers with but not something they themselves need to follow.",

In the midst of a very difficult hiring year for international teachers (pre-COVID, obs), The Director of a brand new school in Poland called me out of the blue and offered me what was basically a dream position. The interview was him complement-bombing my résumé which wasn’t shabby but definitely wasn’t as impressive as he seemed to think. But after months of rejections from innumerable schools, I was happy to take the compliments. \n\nThe events that would take place next, I have written about in great detail: https://deepsouthrefugee.com/2019/02/20/the-warsaw-episode/\n\nBut the short version is this: I uprooted my life to move to a new continent to work for a fake school led by an international criminal who conned dozens, if not hundreds of people just like me. By the time the dust settled, All that was left was 150 children with no school, 20 suddenly unemployed teachers, Interpol, and the Chinese mafia.\n\nEdit: formatting",

            "text": "Last year I made the mistake of leaving one manufacturing job for another. I was overwhelmed with COVID anxiety, and I thought my new employer (Flynn Group of Companies) was handling COVID much better. At least, that was the impression I got from the interview. They explicitly stated that they took COVID seriously, and that the plant was a safe environment. Considering they checked my temperature when I went in for the interview, I figured it was standard practice.\n\nIt was a tough time for me to switch jobs. My wife and I found out that we were expecting, the same week I was supposed to start at Flynn. I had reservations about switching jobs in the middle of the pregnancy, but my wife supported the move. She knew just how bad my anxiety was at my old employer. I took the plunge, and boy was it a mess.\n\nOn my first day, the kid I was working with said that I should've stayed at my old work place, because I had told him that the only reason I switched jobs was COVID anxiety. Since it was my 1st day, I had entered through the office and had my temperature taken. The next day when I went into the plant from the start of shift, I found out that there was no temperature check for the hundreds of plant employees. We had to fill out an online survey, but there was nothing else. At the end of my first day, I dropped my lunch container and broke it. It was an omen of sorts.\n\nI felt like I was out of the frying pan and into the fire. My old employer had mandatory temperature checks, and was an overall cleaner environment. I was now working for a much larger organization that had more lax safety rules. I couldn't believe that such a massive company could be so careless about safety. It wasn't just the COVID stuff. People weren't wearing gloves, I had to ask for ear plugs, and the brake press didn't have proper safety curtains. I was so focused on the other new machine, that I didn't pay attention to the old one, during my interview. The majority of my work would be on the old unsafe machine.\n\nDuring my first break on my second day, I called my old manager and asked him if I could come back. If he couldn't accommodate, I would've looked elsewhere. I'm fairly good at press work, and I knew what I could get. Beyond all that stuff, one of the first things my new employer told me was to not share my pay rate. I immediately realized that I was in a company that would not advance my pay, regardless of what they promised in the interview.\n\nI felt like I was cheated out of a comfortable life. I was happy in my old job, even if I was paranoid over COVID. Flynn was a complete shit show. Everything was a mess, from the COVID screening, manager expectations, and safety protocols. My manager at Flynn didn't like me from the beginning, and I have a feeling the color of my skin didn't help. They did nothing to make me feel comfortable in my new job, nor did they try to help me learn.\n\nI was let go on Wednesday, and I was sure to let the manager know that I didn't ask for the job. In fact, I turned Flynn down after my first interview. They wore me down with promises of advancement, and the opportunity to work for such a large company. I even told him that my wife's expecting, and we don't need this headache right now. His response was something I'll always remember. \"I wasn't a part of the hiring process\". That was the second time he said that to me, and it finally clicked that he meant he would've never hired me to begin with. What I never understood was, why wasn't the guy I would work for a part of the hiring process?\n\nI created this throwaway to post this story, because that was the worst treatment I've ever experienced from an employer. I've since moved on from manufacturing, but it really showed that companies don't care about anything but their bottom line. Why pay someone $23 an hour when you can find some poor immigrant or young worker to do it for $15? These companies really don't get that you get what you pay for. If you keep me making the minimum, there's always room to grow. Keep me well paid and I'll reward you with my utmost attention.\n\n**Fuck you, Flynn!** I know you're too big to fail, but I can finally put that ordeal behind me.",

I’m a systems programmer at a senior level, which is a lot of meetings and analysis. Everything I can and only will do at home (or anywhere not in an office). My employers sign my contract with a full remote position based on 8 hours/day. I’ve taken seriously the work/life balance over many C-Suite promotion opportunities. What good is a Ferrari parked there until 10pm. Coming home to an enormous house at night to wake up hours later to suit up. I realize many, many, people don’t have this opportunity. As an army vet, I thank ‘you’ for your service especially in a pandemic. I just think, if you can do it, don’t give up half your life to a cubicle and half to sleep.

Well ok then. I started the job hunt and left a few months later. Within three years the company I left was destroyed by the SEC after an investigation.

            "text": "I had an interview about  2 months ago and it was a good start, took the job learned the routine and its system for 3 months; a month in and this logistic supervisor tells me about the reason everybody left when I first began. that there was no organization, shipping product was slow and he even said I could be a warehouse manager if I had fixed this problem up. I said nothing due to the fact I've been in the situation before. That there was my first red flag. As we agreed prior to the interview a month ago, this supervisor would come in and he would state, give me a few days people are not staying and leaving the first day, he would say every other week till they fired me on my 3rd month. I learned two positions during the 3 months I stayed. This older man had been there for 2 years, his name was Jose like 52 60 or 6,1 bald. I think..I dont recall now..but he would preach to keep his faith or w.e.mumble under his breath. that there was the 2rd red flag. When they placed me to that new position, I didnt realize the position I had signed up for was to take his position and he was doing my job(shipping and receiving). I discussed this to the supervisor and he tried to convince me that I was wrong, too many errors that my writing was horrible, I had no experience, inwhich my resume had stated something different. Anyways which was why they placed me there as a picker and packer. I was told by my work buddies I had done them correctly, so I confront the supervisor about it and he said the same thing about the last position.  This was my last red flag. I spoke up about it, I brought everyone that I was working with to explain the matter and see where it goes off. This was the beginning of the second month. three weeks with no problems, I had my position back and it was all good. Jose takes a day off(its just two people on the floor him and i)3 day weekend. After that day jose comes back and starts doing my position and starts ordering me around stated that I had to be a picker, that he was the warehouse manager when I was working with him the last month and few weeks and he had never spoken up about that. none of my business right..well on my last month, I didnt want to complain or start trouble so I was a packer for that last month..while jose was doing shipping and receiving. The logistic supervisor jieme started to organize the warehouse but not in a team manner. he bossed me around, take credit when I organized the racks, threw boxes at me and acted as if it slipped and would continue from high places. I spoke up once again about it and no change, I confronted him and said listen \"this isnt my position and the way you're treating me isnt changing. I brought it up and no change after a week. we argued for a whole hour, during those two weeks I wasnt picking or doing my actual position. This was my 3rd last day there. I was basically moving boxes at this point.. the next day, I start to actually organize the boxs put them in the correct locations right codes etc etc. For the reason I was asking to many questions..i guess idk..I was yelled at by both of them and I responded with the same energy but in a lower tone..I do not yell..but at this point both of them were harassing me and I confronted hr about it the next day early that morning round 10 o'clock in the morning..right before lunch(same day) I was fired. Turns out the reason why the 5 employees left was because of the logistics supervisor, he was treating them wrong, empty promises and as well as a social bully.. he would bully the janitor till he cried. A whole grownups man minding his business until jieme comes and runs that.  he creates music and I do too..so him and were close off rip. and he told me everything before I was fired. what was going on before I got there. I keep in contact with musician but not the last few weeks I hope he's doing okay. just might send him a text tomorrow. I signed the papers cause during the confrontation, jose pointed the box cutter when I denied his demand, which was how the arguement started and then jieme yelled at me for me actually organizing the warehouse after I denied Jose's goal. I didn't tell hr and let it go. There was no point in fighting. Jose jieme and some other guy were apart of this and it was hostile at this point. Certain things I'd do at home wasn't the same and just the little thing, I'm not a stressful person but when theres problem it gets worse or theres a solution.. idk just wanted this off my chest or w.e",

The job seemed amazing, I went for it even though I was under qualified (another red flag). \n\nI overhear someone talking about how the person on my position was only there for 6 months. (Didn’t think anything of it at the time). My supervisor oversaw a team of 6 people, 5 in the office; 1 person worked from home, 3 others worked under him but basically had mastered the art of staying out of his way. My role was directly under him, think a bit like (assistant to the regional manager) sort of thing. After a few days, I realised I had a big job ahead of me getting to grips with everything learning a lot of totally new skills and he was nice enough. A bit micromanagy at times, but I had just assumed that it was in good faith. \n\n(Side note: Council organisational structure sucks, he was head of the team, then his boss was head of the department, then her boss was the head of the sector then her boss was the the head honcho, confusing I know) \n\nThen I started noticing weird stuff, I remember I was invited into a meeting with the head of our department. Where my supervisior basically pitched to the department head this idea to do with the digital team making resources and she loved it. Later that day, I was invited to a meeting with him and the head of the sector, where he told the head of the sector that “the head of the department had come up with this idea and here’s all the reasons it’s terrible “.  I was shocked and didn’t really know what to do. In hindsight I should have said something. \n\nSomething else that stuck with me; The way that he spoke about people who used council services was shocking to me. Spoke about them like they were rats. \n\nThen I notice another massive red flag, the percentage of people taking time off work with stress was quite high. \n\nIf one of his superiors came in, he would do things like quickly look over my shoulder and appear to be helping me correct my work (Yes it was as transparent as it sounds) and i was extremely naive about it. But as this is happening I start to get let in a bit in on office banter and I get a bigger picture Of what’s going on. I found out that three people had been in my role, none of them longer then six months. To which I was slightly concerned. I was raised by my grandmother who died 5 years prior so I didn’t really have any relatives who could help me with money and was extremely reliant on this income. Ended up working under him for around 3 years.\n\nA few instances which tell a bigger picture of how difficult i found it. Once he came in and berated ,literally shouting at, me in front of the entire office because he said the shared email was a mess because I wasn’t deleting my emails. I didn’t say anything (I was so confused because I was certain that there couldn’t have been many that belonged to me) I checked and there were 15 emails in the inbox, 13 were his and 2 were mine. \n\nAnother time, I came to my desk and he had emptied out some garbage onto my desk because he thought I had put a plastic cup lid in the wrong bin. To which one of my co-workers actually stepped up and admitted it was them and not me. I had to clean up the garbage. \n\nI start looking for and applying for jobs at this point but where I lived at the time, the job market absolutely sucked. I even applied for McDonald’s and didn’t get it. \n\nIf you came to him with a problem. He would go ballistic at you, which made me not want to bring him any problems and just sit on them to which if he found out he would go ballistic. \n\nOver three years I stood up to him twice and On three separate occasions I went to HR. When I stood up to him and shouted back, he would leave me alone for a few weeks. HR, twice told me it was being handled and once offered to do a sit down interview between me and him. In three years they never ever helped or did anything. Which is so frustrating. \n\nI gained a lot of weight and started to develop some very bad anxiety. Thankfully the council rules regarding leaving for stress were really lax, and so I started to take a good amount of time off with stress and this helped alot. \n\nWhen lockdown happened, it was like heaven not being trapped in an office with him. But it soon became awful. \n\nBasically He accused me of not working hard enough. So he said at the end of the day, I would have to clock in what work I’d done on the usual spreadsheet, make a note on trello, ring him and explain to him what I’d done that day and also send him an email with basically everything I’d done and every step id taken. \n\nWe already had a system for clocking what work we’d done; ironically I’d actually worked so hard on weeks he wasn’t here, even doing hours overtime, in a desperate attempt that he would leave me alone. Stupid and unhealthy, but I wasn’t exactly thinking straight. \n\nMy mate worked in a university in a city across the border, and basically told me about this job going which was exactly what I was doing at the council. So I applied for it and got an interview, i had never prepared for an interview so hard in all my life. But sadly I didn’t get it. I was so gutted because I really felt like I did a good job. I reached out to my friend in the university department and asked what I could do differently, apparently the reference my supervisor gave was horrible. \n\nAfter I heard that I really fell off the deep end mentally. I was in such a bad place, one of the darkest of my life I found myself so hopeless and empty. \n\nAs lockdown was ending. And we were being told we were coming closer to coming back into the office I was feeling so anxious. I couldn’t see a way out. \n\nAll I have to say about what happened next. God hadn’t forgotten me. \n\nMy friend from university, got in contact with me and told me my literal dream job had opened up in a city quite far away from where I lived. Ever since university, I’d dreamt of working for this very particular company that basically supports students, mentally, emotionally. And helps them away from home. When I was a student, this company was a huge part of my life, especially dealing with my grandmothers death. And I had always dreamed of working for them, but I’d applied about 4 times in the past and didn’t get an interview so I had just come to believe that I didn’t have what it takes. \n\nMy friend was really encouraging, she was equally impacted by it as a student, and now worked for it. She said she thought i would be amazing so I should go for it. \n\nIn total, I spent around 30 hours on my application. I deliberately took a part time job on top of my council job so I wouldn’t have to put this guy down as a reference. And I got an interview. The interview process is extremely thorough and rigorous. I had interviewed about 5 people who previously had the job, to get tips for the interview. I was so stressed during it that I developed a stomach problem. Which required me to go to the doctor Which basically meant I was in a huge amount of pain the whole time and literally did not sleep the night before. \n\nI did the interview. The director sat in on my interview which was apparently quite odd. I’m told I’ll find out in a month if I’ve got it. And I start telling myself that there’s no way I got it. About 3 days later, the person who would go on to be my current supervisor, gets in contact to tell me, that they absolutely loved me. And I’ve got the job. I thank him and after the phone call just started crying. I cried alot over the next few months, honestly tears of joy. \n\nmy exit interview for the council came up,it was 3 hours. And the whole thing was so bizarre. He was calling me all these horrible names, telling me how bad I would be in the next job saying I’m not confident enough to do it well. The last question he asked me, after he had gone on this rant was “anything to say to me?” And I just smiled in his fucking face and said nope. And I honestly, honestly meant it. \n\nApparently He went on to tell all my coworkers a tonne of lies about me, that I was an anti-vaxxer that I’d tried to hit him and crap like that in my exit interview. \n\n\nMy conclusion is that this guy was just a classic careerist. Had basically no management skills, but deeply insecure, terrified of being exposed and was solely focused on how he appeared to his superiors. And maybe it wasn’t that bad and mentally I just wasn’t strong enough to cope with it I dunno. \n\nIt’s been about a year since then, I moved to another city to start this job, And the thing I love about this job is that they are so pastoral. They truly care about how you’re doing. With my supervisor in my new job, he helped me to truly understand how abusive that my previous situation was and he’s helping me process it. I love him dearly. A father figure I’ve never had. I’m still dealing with it of course, still trying to overcome the anxiety I developed. But I’m so happy. Every time I look into these students eyes that I work with. A piece of me wants to cry, I had honestly given up and never imaged a way out. And now I’m doing the only thing I’ve ever wanted to do with my life",

They claimed to have flexible scheduling, but as time progressed, that proved to be false. When my brother passed unexpectedly in a car accident while I was at work, I asked my manager if I could take bereavement. Instead of giving me time off, he refuses and ultimately decided to send me home for the afternoon. I was expected to come back to work like normal afterwards. Along with that, I rarely ever got days off. If we wanted time off, we had to find someone to cover our shifts. No exceptions. Unless we had COVID-19, getting days off was no easy feat. After seeing how they treated that situation, I quit shortly after. I'm in high school still. Making money is fairly important, but I didn't want to miss out on important experiences. I also didn't like the fact that I worked way more hours than a 16 year old was supposed to. I had two jobs at that time, (needed the extra money) but I quit my food service job back in November.

I would literally wake up each morning, get dressed in slacks and a button up and would receive a text saying I had work the following days every day that week but not that day.

Pre-pandemic when I was going to hiring conventions while an undergrad interviewing with charters was always a fun and interesting experience. \n\nMy first time interviewing with said schools, they promoted the amount of resources, appliances, and utilities offered to teachers and students. This was more often than not a marketing pitch for essentially the same stuff the average public school would offer with a little bit of flexibility for parental wants/needs. \n\nThe biggest red flag that might trick people though was the amount of \"autonomy\" and \"opportunity for growth\". They try to sell you this fantasy of becoming a \"DEAN\" after only one to two years of teaching!  Becoming a dean meant more control over the program, larger pay grade, and offering grad opportunities for other degrees. \n\nSounds good on paper right? WRONG the average success rate in years for charter schools is about 4 years. If it does not survive that 4th  year it generally fails and goes under with only the president walking away with the financial insurance/security of their business imploding. Charters suck they are not places for learning they just take advantage of already financially struggling families; while there are a few good ones out there that seek to help families with children with very specific needs (generally severe physical or mental disabilities) they are for the most part all equally bad to teach in and even the higher end of the salary scale if you make it through all the BS is essentially the equivalent of that of a normal public school teacher salary. \n\nBy the time you'd be able to reap any of the shiny offers they stated, the charter will most likely be ready to go bankrupt and fail. Stay away at all costs if you have interest or inclination in teaching stick to the public school system and support the union. If you really wanna give charters a shot, be prepared to do a lot of research and detective work on the school and talk to the present teachers there.",

After only 2months of working the easy job I was hired for, got moved to the warehouse to help out while one guy had to go get shoulder surgery. The remaining one was a piece of shit, so much so that I was the go to person despite him being there longer. It turns out, it was because I wouldn't say no. Started working longer hours, before I knew it my average OT was 60-70hrs biweekly (140-150hrs total for 2weeks). Once surgery guy came back (restricted from labor and only 4hr days for 2months) they fired the guy that I was working with. So it went from an already undermanned department, to an even more undermanned department, oh we're an international multi million dollar company btw! The department was the red headed step child of the facility, no manager, no lead, nothing. The hours continued for another 4 months or so until I was brought up in a safety meeting because it was +100°F outside and the warehouse had no A/C. HR talked to me and after I told them I was getting fucked over, we went through 8 Temps (I had to train every single one, and none gave a shit because it's hard work and no pay) until finally stealing another guy from another department. The whole time I was back there, I was walked all over because I was just a kid in their eyes. I was told I was wrong or doing something wrong when it turned out to be someone else's fuck up initially that lead to said fuck up (work instructions for how much material was needed was off 90% of the time, either not enough material or way too much, etc). I also went from day shift to swings while back there to attempt to spread out the work load but it was still mostly on me. \n\nThat was a few years ago or so, still work there just moved \"up\" to manufacturing and currently on graveyards, so I've collected all of the shifts as well. I do try to go back and help that department as much as I can, but honestly I'm just fucking done with the company's mentality. They get no help, no support, and all the blame because that's where production starts in the manager's minds. Management is truly the failure of this company and I wouldn't be surprised if this branch is shut down in the next 5years or so",

They hire 20-50 people at one time and at the end of the training session, less than 10 people remain. And then you start and you discover for the work you do, you should be getting paid at least double. the district manager doesn't have the first clue as to what he or she is doing and is abusive to the employees. And the supervisors are the ones with the chance for advancement, but they have to move to another city and they pay offered is well below par, and then they discover the supervisor's not qualified because they don't have a college degree. And then after 90 days, you get your first pay increase: a generous five cents! Working for a minimum wage employer is more like working in hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I worked for a company that basically paid minimum wage starting; I worked up to supervisor and then I was going to be a area manager but I had to move to another city in another state. I agreed and my salary at the time was going to be $28,500. This was around 2005. A friend of mine had been promoted to area manager and he was paid $40,000, despite the fact I had more experience than he did. For whatever reason, the position disappeared and they asked me to consider two other cities in two other states. And again, I said yes. It was a crummy deal but I was willing to play the game. Nothing ever happened.  \n\nThen an asshole who I had known for about five years by that point and had picked up a subtle dislike of me coming from him was promoted to temporary production supervisor. He jumped my ass one night because someone I had hired was trying to get my position when I left and when it looked like that wasn't going to happen, attempted to get me eased out of the position I held. \n\nThe asshole didn't know how close he came to having the shit beat out of him.I thought about quitting right there and then and smashing his face in as a parting shot. I was outside for a little bit and cooled down but then complained to the area manager as to what had transpired and that I wanted to file a complaint against Mr. Asshole. \n\nI met up with her the next day in the office to file the complaint. Nothing was done about it. She kept us apart, working at different locations. Which was the wrong solution. Another job came my way and I decided I had given enough of my life to the company I had been with. I trained all of their supervisors and managers they brought in from outside. I trained Mr. Asshole. I gave my notice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe district manager came up and we talked and I just said it was time to move on. I wish I could say I told him about the collusion between area manager and Mr. Asshole and get them fired, but I figured they would eventually give their treachery away. I ran into the former area manager about three years ago. She and Mr. Asshole were still working for the company. She had another position and Mr. Asshole still had the area manager position. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I ever see Mr. Asshole again, I will just ignore him and pretend I do not know who he is. He always disrespected me so I have no desire to make like I'm glad to see him again. If I were to ever see the district manager again, I would finally tell him the real reason I left. There was an up-the-chain-of-command within the company regarding complaints, and since the then-area manager had done nothing about my complaint regarding Mr. Asshole. he would've been the next in line. \n\nThe DM had wrongly gotten written up when another supervisor didn't go up the chain of command and instead went all the way to the top to complain about another party. As a result, the DM was no longer eligible for future promotions within the company. That was wrong. I should've told the DM what happened and how pissed off I was, but he was a nice guy and I didn't want to cost him his job. His boss was a friend of mine and I know if the DM hadn't acted, he would've been out of a job. The opportunity which came my way made that unnecessary.",

They said they would hire me right away but I had to pass the mandatory drug screening and an fbi background check. So I complied. Was really happy about it. When all they stuff came back they called me in for an orientation. There were about 4 of us there. The guy kept going on and on about how good the company was to it's workers. I raised my hand and asked where would we be traveling. He said mostly southeast regional. Which is over the road. I was like hold on, I specifically applied for the local stuff. He got real ticked off and said we don't just give that to anyone, you have to earn it by being on the road until a spot opens up. I said you said there were currently spots available and that I already drive over the road. He said take it or leave it, but if you walk out we'll report you to (I don't remember the name now, but it was some kind of ruling trucking authority) and I said well have at it. 3 of us ended up walking out right then, and sure enough next place I applied for asked me why I was a no call no show at that job. Had to explain how they baited and switched me and 2 other guys and that I think they did it to everyone. Wasn't happy about it.",

So you better put up with being cancelled whenever, sent home whenever.  Work at the same company for years before they even mentioning they gonna hire you. I knew a guy who worked harder then anyone I ever seen for 3 years just for the agency to say his time expired at the company and it’s time to move on. Now he’s a janitor at a school making $5 more then I am :P also my place demoted me after 6 years with the company although people in the same position on other shifts had 2-3 years less seniority then me after fully training me on 20 different jobs and mastering them all. Now I’m back on temporary assignment watching these new people suck so hard while they kicked out their rock star. Also the trainers are incompetent I’m constantly showing people better ways to do the same things and the trainers don’t bother using my knowledge to better themselves. Literally these people passed a math test and a job interview with HR(I didn’t apply because they only hire females for that role). Now I’m watching this place fall apart but it’s less satisfying because it could also be blamed on the pandemic. Also HR told me and the others that got demoted that they had to do it to save the company. My weekly paycheque lost $3, i didn’t realize how tight shit was there damn. But also I’m mad because new people are getting better opportunities then me even tho I’ve proven myself time and time again. I’ve worked in 5 divisions of this place and know over 40 different jobs and all I asked for was my $3 a week back just cuz I really loved that job.",

Getting a \"Good work!\" or \"Nice job today!\" is totally fine, but if you ever get a boss that constantly goes over the top with \"Wow! We couldn't survive without you! You're so amazing!\" and over over the top compliments that is a major red flag. It usually means the following. The boss has no idea what the hell they are doing and you are getting their ass out of the fire by doing the job correctly. This also means that if you do something wrong, that means that they are going to come down on you because someone came down on them about it. The second thing is that they will use the constant compliments almost like leverage against you to go above and beyond what you should be doing. Making you feel bad or obligated to work more, stay late, show up early or do jobs that you are not required to do because your boss or manager is now your buddy. \n\nThe second example is a lot harder for people to get out of especially if they're sympathetic or feel for other people. That doubles if the job they're doing is shit and they know what the manager has to do and they know that it will be horrible to do on their own. So those people get caught in this trap of over compliments and over niceness as payment for doing things that they normally shouldn't have to do at all.

Ok 🤷‍♀️…Owner then offers me two shots of vodka straight off the bat, which I accept. I’m the only worker there besides her. The next 5 hours I’m constantly moving. Mama San is drinking red wine the entire time with some regulars at the bar, getting pretty sloppy. The bar gets super crowded. I’m getting crazy tips because it’s almost Christmas. I was instructed to put all the cash tips in a big jar behind the bar - which I do. Now Mama San’s wasted and I’m not far behind. She goes into the kitchen to start cooking hot pupus (drinking food/appetizers in Hawaii). She comes back out to drink some more wine—I’m literally running from table to table taking orders, serving the bar. …it’s about midnight and I smell some smoke coming from the kitchen. Go to see what it is - Mama San left some clams cooking in a pan and they’re now on fire. I scream. She looks disoriented. A couple drunk guys try in vain to find a fire extinguisher. I run next store to a restaurant called Town (my favorite- closed during the pandemic), and yell at my friend Gooch who was a chef there - “come help!!! There’s a fire!!” . He puts down whatever mis en place he’s working on to grab their extinguisher 🧯 and follows me. As we approach the door to Aloha Lounge, people streaming out quickly, enveloped in smoke…we hear a loud BOOM followed by a crash and yelling. Mama San comes out followed by two save the  day drunk guys, who told us a butane tank exploded and flew across the room. By that time 2 fire trucks and 3 cop cars were there. Firemen start doing their thing…in the parking lot, cops are trying to interview people, find out who’s in charge. Someone points at me. I lead the police over to wasted Mama San, who now has roughly 15% of her eyebrows left. Once the firemen have put out the fire, and are letting folks back in to grab their stuff…I slip in and empty the full tip jar (about $350) into my bag and hightail it outta there. This was in 2011.

The most senior guy who was in the department 3 decades ago said not a lot of people get confirmed and sometimes they'll extend the trial up to 6 months.

More than one union if you are ever in a role that involves business change. You can’t win.\n4. More than 4 interviews that are similar. They eventually are likely to low ball you and hope that sunk cost fallacy will get you to accept.\n5. Every boss who interviews you are from the same elite universities- if you didn’t go to the same ones then you will never be listened to.\n6. Offering you a lower paid/responsibility role with a “fast track” mentoring scheme to the higher paid/responsibility role - there is no fast track.\n7. People in your potential management line have only ever worked there or have been there for 15+ years. Chances of innovative thinking and openness to change are low.\n8. A potential line manager who speaks at TED talks, conferences and is constantly self promoting themselves and not the organisation. You will end up doing their job and your own as they focus on their next presentation.\n9. Any potential line manager who buys an interview in a payola magazine and talks about being people focused. They are person focused I.e. themselves.\n10. Any company that’s origin has historically been a long term enemy of your nationality. It’s rare for Brits go high up or win political battles in French companies for example.\n11. How old the laptops are - take a look when you go into the interview, if in person.\n12. Your likely department doesn’t have a logical seat on the board and instead reports into another- for example tech into sales, tech into finance, operations into HR/equivalent.\n13. Everyone is very good looking- if you’re not then you’re going to have a bad time.\n14. Job descriptions don’t match the role very precisely and have lots of other responsibilities that ultimately should be someone else’s- that means no one wants those and hope you will do them with a smile on your face.\n15. It’s 100% owned by the CEO - they may see all money spent as coming out of their yacht fund.\n16. Churn rate is high.\n17. There’s a very nice man/lady who helps you and then tells you how they’ve been mistreated - believe them.\n18. Stiffs you at bonus time.\n19. Make cuts to pay/bonuses during bad times but then doesn’t reciprocate during good times.\n20. Doesn’t offer training but still magically expects its staff to stay ahead of the curve.\n21. Any boss who gets people to call them “The Big Kahuna”, “The Wolf” or any other stupid name.\n22. Enforcement of clique- Hawaiian shirts, golf days, tough mudder etc.\n23. Move people who have been proved to corrupt/incompetent/shitheads to somewhere else in the company rather than out the door.\n24. CEO known to have intimate relationship with someone you compete with internally. Getting his dick sucked vs. Your 5% improvement as justification for funding approval.\n25.

That I am not obligated to do sales as I will be working for technical team. I had also mentioned it in all my interviews that I don't want sales at all. And after i got the job i found out that there is a sales target and that I will have to do it. This happened with others as well. I took this to the management and nothing happened. Then they slowly started to increase the targets. Increasing in a level that most of the employees weren't able to achieve. I was one of them obviously. And they increased target in everything and not just sales. And if even one of the target were not met, we will not get the sales incentive. I mean the target started with 1% that is one sale in a week, and within a few years reached to 6% which means they wanted minimum two sales everyday. Which is stupid because we were from the technical team. We are supposed to resolve customer issue and not sell them stuff. I mean there is a sales team for exactly that, isn't it. And then when this was not enough, they got in mobile lines. I mean there was an entire team for mobiles and mobile lines while we worked for wifi, cable and landline, they got the rule that unless we don't have one active mobile line sale in a month, we will not get any sale money at all.

Taking days off was considered a cardinal sin so most requests would be denied, management (or micro-management for a better term) was hyper focused on what I said and how I said it, and if they saw it was going to be a big sale I’d get bumped out of the conversation with the customer and replaced with someone else so there was no way to hit my targets to begin with.

If it is not signed, dated, and contractually enforced, it is virtually worth nothing. A well trained business major will literally break his promise to you to let you off to bury your own grandparents because you are absolutely critical to staffing that weekend and he cannot let you go.  \n\n\nMissleading Advertisements are things like salary or work conditions. For example, the phrase \"Industry Leading\" Is a fucking joke and then some. It is almost always used by niche, non-compete industries where no one gives a fuck that you are a leading partner in. Infact, industry leading often translates to 'employee fucking'.  \n\n\nSalary wise, hard, upfront numbers are your best bet. No bullshit, a straight shooter that tells you 'this is what you get every hour, these are the bonuses for shifts x and y, this is what you can expect as a bonus for this, this is what we cover, this is what we don't. '. If anywhere in the recruitment process you where lured into the talks with one number, and then told a different number, you leave, no questions asked. Because you are being effectively fucked by dishonest, sleazy paper pushers.  \n\n\nMisdirection would be promising you your dream position yet just trying to poach you for a different job. You expect your work environment to be X, yet they want to shove you into Y. Doesnt matter whether you are a single parent that has time constraints that must be respected, or that you have health issues that must be respected. If you where offered one thing, and yet are pushed towards another, ce la vie.  \n\n\nAs for future promises; Anything that isn't in paper is worth nothing. They will all promise you a promotion if you 'do good', guarantee a 'future' if you 'excel in your effort'. Yet ask one of them to put their money where their mouth is, and to contractually obligate themselves to advance and educate you when you meet actual numbers, and suddenly they all start flinching.

The first thing I noticed that set me off a bit was that there were papers all over. I just got a weird vibe when I stepped in the office. Everything just seemed dated and I could feel that it was a job that goes nowhere, but I decided to work for them anyway because they were nice people and friends with one of my professors and I was only going to work there 2 to 3 days a week anyway until I graduated. One thing I never realized when I first walked in was that there were no windows. After a while I felt cramped in a tiny office like that with clutter everywhere. But the biggest thing was that the vents that lead from the office to the outside were pulling in the smell of cigarettes from people smoking outside. The other workers were probably so used to it but I would leave that office with a splitting migraine from the smell every time. \n\nThe one client thing. That same company used to do a bunch of work for many clients a decade ago. But over the years they dwindled down and basically just served this one client which was one of the biggest costume suppliers. I found from someone a year or two ago that they basically went out of business due to the pandemic. That one client they had was going to shut down or something and as a result they had no work. They were all nice people but it was a place that was hanging on by a thread. I hope they are all doing okay now.\n\nAnd as far as websites and office aesthetics go.

I done something hella ballsy and opened the link (I don’t recommend this since some links could be viruses or malware, but luckily this one wasn’t) and on the application they asked me for my SSN… shady as all hell because jobs normally ask you for that AFTER you’re hired on, not during the application process. I did NOT give them that.\n\nThen, I done the smart thing and played dumb: I asked them to describe what the roles are in that position, and when they responded, I compared it to what Indeed had listed, and they were, in fact, different than what this person stated.\n\nAt that point I already knew that this was a scam, but to add the cherry on top I contacted the physical office and told them who I was and what I called for.\n\nTurns out the company WASN’T hiring anyone new at the moment, and it’s been like that for SEVERAL MONTHS.
