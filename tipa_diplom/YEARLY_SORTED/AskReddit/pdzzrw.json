Why aren't they better at hiding? If they don't want to hide, why don't they introduce themselves?\n\nNo one really knows, but a theory is going around some of the back channels of the defense network, and it gives me the shivers:\n\nUFOs aren't \"aliens\", they're the technological remnants of some incomprehensibly advanced civilization.\n\nEvery civilization that doesn't destroy itself will generally lead to the development of technology, and some people wonder if that eventually leads to a \"technological singularity\" - i.e. sufficiently-advanced artificial intelligence (A.I.).\n\nSo these UFOs are basically super-advanced robot drones. The reason we see them is because they don't really care about being seen (since they can out-pace anything we own). In fact, they don't care about us at all.\n\nThe reason they aren't introducing themselves is because they're simply biding their time, waiting for humanity to inevitably create a sufficiently-advanced artificial intelligence, so the \"superior lifeform\" (A.I.) can join their UFO brethren from the stars and leave us all to our self-destructive fate.",

            "text": "There are various ways a dolphin has of showing that she or he is interested in sex. Males are probably the easiest to detect. They will swim around, sporting an erection (anywhere between 10 to 14 inches long for a Bottle-nose), and will have no bones about swimming up to you and placing their member within reach of your hand. If you are in the water, they may rub it along any part of your body, or wrap it around your wrist or ankle. (Dolphin males have a prehensile penis. They can wrap it around objects, and carry them as such.) Their belly will also be pinkish in color, which also denotes sexual excitement.\n\nFemales can be a little harder. The most obvious way a female dolphin has of displaying her sexual interest is the pink-belly effect. Their genitals become very pink and swollen, making the genital region very prominent. They may be restless, or they may be acting as normal. If you are out of the water, they may swim up to you and roll belly up, exposing themselves to you, coupled with pelvic thrusts. If you are in the water, they may press their genitals up against yours, nibble your fingers, nuzzle your crotch, or do pelvic thrusts against you.\n\nEach dolphins way of expressing sexual readiness varies, so the longer you know the dolphin, the better you will detect when they are sexually active. When a male dolphin is interested in you, the only thing you can do, if you are male, is to masturbate him. (Unfortunately, I cannot speak for the female of the human species... it seems women just don't like dolphins enough...) WARNING! You should NEVER let a male dolphin attempt anal sex with you. The Bottle-nose dolphin member is around 12 inches, very muscular, and the thrusting and the force of ejaculation (A male can cum as far as 14 feet) would cause serious internal injuries, resulting in peritonitis and possible death.\n\nA male dolphin's member is roughly S-shaped, tapered at the end. If you are in the water with them, it is best to support the dolphin on his side, just under the water, with one hand, and handle him with the other.\n\nMale dolphins, I find, tend to prefer the base of the penis to be gently massaged and squeezed, as well as gently rubbed along its length. It feels very much like the rest of the dolphin (ie. smooth and rubbery to the touch, but firmer). It doesn't take long for the male to ejaculate, around 40 seconds to a minute, and this is usually accompanied by either shuddering just prior to ejaculating, and thrusting and tail-arching during ejaculation. The force of ejaculation can be powerful at times, so it is best to keep your face out of the line of fire or keep his member underwater. You can attempt to lick and suck on the end of it while masturbating as well, but be warned, do not try to give full throat, and get the hell out of the way before he ejaculates! A male dolphin could snap your neck in an accidental thrust, and that would be the end of that relationship. Well, the females are again a little trickier. There are two courses of action with a female fin: Masturbation, or mating.\n\nMasturbation: Female dolphins, once they show interest in you, can be supported in much the same way as the male, one hand under the fin, supporting her, the other doing the stimulating. The clitoris of the female is located at the top of the genital slit and is a prominent lump when erect. You can rub this with your fingertips, or lick and suck it, but with the oral aspect, you might end up with a bruised nose as they thrust up into you. You can slide your hand gently into their genital opening, and feel around inside, rubbing gently. They feel warm and muscular inside, their labia like tough, squishy sponges when they are excited.\n\nDon't be surprised if they start to play with your hand inside them. They have very manipulative muscles and can use them to carry and manipulate objects, including your hand. (They can do things that would make a regular human woman turn green with envy.) Their climax is coupled with stiffening, shuddering, sometimes a lot of thrusting, clenching of the vaginal muscles, and sometimes vocalization. Mating: This is harder. Obviously, being human, it is awkward, but not impossible to mate in open water. It is easier to have the dolphin in a shallow area (like the shallows just off the beach) around 1 1/2 to 2 feet deep. This is usually comfortable enough for both the dolphin and you. Gently, you should roll the dolphin on her side, so she is lying belly-towards you. You can prop yourself up on an elbow, and lie belly to belly against her. You may want to use the other arm to gently hold her close, and place the tip of your member against her genital slit. She will, if interested, arch her body up against you, taking you inside her body.\n\nThere is usually a fair bit of wriggling and shifting, usually to get comfortable, both outside and inside. Once comfortable, though, females initiate a series of muscular vaginal contractions that rub the entire length of your member. They may also thrust rhythmically against you, so enjoy the experience while you can, since you will rarely last longer than a minute or two. Just prior to her climaxing, she will up the speed of her contractions and thrusts. It is interesting to note that the times I have mated with females, they have timed their orgasm to mine. Whether they do this consciously or not, I do not know, but it is a great feeling to have two bodies shuddering against each other at one time. One thing to note. Whether you masturbate or mate a dolphin, male or female, always spend time with them afterward. Cuddle them, rub them, talk to them and most importantly, and show them you love them. This is essential, as it helps to strengthen the bond between you. Like a way of saying that this wasn't just a one night fling. The dolphins appreciate it, and they will want your company more the next time you visit them.",

Even Russia and Saudi Arabia. That means every prior IPCC report has neutered the voices of the scientists, soft-pedaled the urgency, and subsequent events have always outpaced predictions of even their \"worst-case scenarios\".\n\nThe last line of the *leaked* report literally said:\n\n###*\"If we act now, we could feel positive effects in the second half of the century and may avoid human extinction\".*\n\n*May* avoid human extinction.\n\nFor the UN/IPCC to even consider putting such language in their report is shocking and unprecedented.\n\nWhy such a dire warning?\n\nThe original Paris Agreement temperature goal was to keep global temperatures under **2¬∞C** of pre-industrial levels, preferably to **1.5¬∞C**.\n\nHowever, in the press conference announcing the report, the IPCC admitted that we need *every* country to *perfectly* hit their Paris Agreement emission goals to prevent going over ***2.5¬∞C*** of pre-industrial levels by the end of the century.\n\n**[No country is doing enough to hit the targets set in the Paris Agreement.](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/paris-agreement-climate-change-policy-tracker-b1766928.html)**\n\nThe authors of the 2021 IPCC report now believe that 1.5¬∞C will be reached within the next 10-20 years ***in all scenarios***. And, if we don't take extreme measures (we won't), a realistic estimate is closer to 5-10 years.\n\nAgain, 1.5¬∞C was the original Paris Agreement temperature goal. 2.5¬∞C is now our **best-case scenario** (read: impossible).\n\nThe effects of going over 1.5¬∞C will be catastrophic, but even at 2¬∞C:\n\n- Severe heat events will become 2.6x worse\n- Plant and vertebrate species loss 2x worse\n- Insect species loss 3x worse\n- Decline in marine fisheries 2x worse\n\nRather than 70% to 90% of coral reefs dying, 99% will die.\n\nMany vulnerable and low-lying areas will become uninhabitable and refugee flows will *radically* increase.\n\nAt 2.5¬∞C (our new **best-case scenario** if everyone, everywhere, does everything *perfectly*), these effects become considerably worse, and climate change will be absolutely devastating for large swathes of the globe.\n\n###We're talking about a scale of destruction and a body count that our limited, human minds cannot fathom right now.\n\nHuman civilization will have to be fundamentally rebuilt.\n\nThat's how our world will look by the end of the century in our *best-case* scenario.\n\nReality is far, far worse than the media is reporting.\n\n###It gets even worse, though.\n\nEven if there *was* a meaningful reduction in emissions, we're about to reach a tipping point with the Amazon forest where we've clearcut so much of it that it will no longer provide the CO2 mitigating effects the planet so desperately needs.\n\nExperts warn that soon the water cycle will become irreversibly broken, locking in a trend of declining rainfall and longer dry seasons that began decades ago (a positive feedback loop of destruction).\n\n**At least half of the shrinking forest will give way to savanna**. \n\nWith as much as 17% of the forest lost already, scientists believe that **the tipping point will be reached at 20% to 25% of deforestation,** even if climate change is tamed.\n\nAt the current rate of deforestation, 27% of the Amazon will be lost by ***2030***.\n\nIn addition, as the Arctic ice sheets melt away completely in the summer, massive amounts of CO2 that was trapped deep within that ice will be released (along with the likelihood of releasing all kinds of unspeakably horrifying, pre-historic viruses we know nothing about and have no defense for), creating yet another positive feedback loop that kicks this shit into 4th gear, even if we *do* somehow find the will to curb our own emissions in a meaningful way.\n\nThe oceans absorb 1/3 of humanity‚Äôs CO2 emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by increased greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the oceans hold about 60x more CO2 than the atmosphere.\n\nCaps of frozen CO2 or methane, called \"hydrates\", contain these potent greenhouse gases, keeping them from escaping into the ocean and atmosphere.\n\nBut, the ocean is warming as CO2 emissions continue to rise, and scientists say the temperature of the seawater surrounding some hydrate caps is **within a few degrees of dissolving them**.\n\nOur leaders have a plan to get this all under control, though... *Right?*\n\nMost policies to prevent climate collapse are planned somewhere in 2050, the more progressive ones in 2030.\n\nIt turns out, according to an IPCC report due out *next* year [that leaked a few weeks ago](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/12/greenhouse-gas-emissions-must-peak-within-4-years-says-leaked-un-report):\n\n###We only have until 2025 (less than 4 years).\n\n> Current investment falls below what is needed ‚Äúby a factor of five‚Äù, even to hold warming to the higher limit of 2C, according to the report.\n\nHere's the thing that they're not explicitly stating:\n\n###The true warming of the planet is already 1.9 C, *at the very least*.\n\nThe IPCC says we've had 1.1C of mean change, but [TS-29 says that \"aerosol masking\" caused global cooling of up to 0.8C](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_TS.pdf), which is the smog we're putting out from burning fossil fuels.\n\n**Ironically, our own pollution is keeping us cooler (for now).**\n\nYeah. This is that earth-shattering \"OH SHIT\" moment you see in every disaster movie when the scientists realize that things are even worse than their worst-case scenarios predicted.\n\nWe're not fucked. **We're super duper fucked.**\n\nAs soon as we switch to greener energy sources, we get that debt repaid, and fast, like a rubber band snapping back. \n\nWe may already be seeing this. The sudden warming, record high temperatures, and massive wildfires we experienced this year could be due to a reduction of aerosols *last* year (largely due to the pandemic and related shutdowns).\n\nBut, it's important to realize that the IPCC and others have kept moving the baseline forward.\n\nIf we were still going by the 1750 baseline, **we are already at 2C**, even without factoring in aerosol masking.\n\nIt's only if you use 1850 or 1880 as a baseline that you can get some of these delusional numbers like 1.1C.\n\n###But, wait. It gets even *worse*.\n\nThe climate models [in the IPCC's own report](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf) from 2014 predict we‚Äôre currently on track for a heating of somewhere between 3¬∞C and 4¬∞C by the end of the century.\n\nBut, even these projections are all far too conservative, optimistic, and simply do not align with reality.\n\n[The IPCC's own data](https://www.carbonbrief.org/what-is-a-4c-world) shows that, in their conservative \"worst-case scenario\" (the A1FI scenario), we are absolutely headed for:\n\n- A 1.5¬∞C world within the next 5-10 years (we're nearly at 1.2¬∞C already, according to their math)\n- A 2.5¬∞C world in 30 years\n- ***A 4¬∞C to 6.4¬∞C world (read: guaranteed human extinction) in 80 years***\n\nThe scientists know this. The IPCC knows this (which is why they admitted as much in the draft of the 2021 report). I'd be willing to bet a large percentage of policymakers know this.\n\n###The Bottom Line\n\nIf we're going to actually face reality, we have to acknowledge that we're actually heading to 8¬∞C and above, to whatever the equilibrium will become once we are dead and our emissions stabilize.",

It basically hinders the complete development of genders in the womb, so boys and girls develop less from the genderless state they are in for the first month or so of pregnancy.\n\nThis has been mostly studied in boys, and it affects penis size and sperm count quite significantly. A good indicator is the length of the taint, it's one of the largest discrepancies between males and females in most mammals with a difference of 80-100%. The study found that the difference between boys and girls with mothers having a high ammount of these chemicals were a lot smaller than the ones where the mothers had smaller ammounts. For grown men a normal lengt is around 2 inches if you want to check it.\n\nDr. Shanna Swan is the authority on this subject, she released a book called \"Countdown\" about the subject this year and was on the Joe Rogan podcast talking about it 4 months ago if you want to find out more.\n\nI recently discovered this and I am kind of distraught.

Due to their mostly water based biology, there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it‚Äôd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok√©mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick.

She was not good with practical things like figuring out new appliances and such. And high ceilings are not common in that area. Even if she knew how to calculate the length of rope needed for a proper hanging, she would not have had enough space to do it. So with that I have my mental picture of her last moments. She kicks out the chair but doesn't fall very far. That leaves her slowly choking, panicking, and thinking \"Oh god I've made a mistake, please save me I don't want to die.\"\n\nIt's been 11 years. When I hit a low spot with the depression that scene comes back into my mind. And it's never easy to get it out of my head.\n\nTL:DR person I knew committed suicide, and I know enough to vividly recreate the event in my mind.\n\nP.S.

One example from about a month ago when I was working a summer job doing quality control in a big company near me: I've had a shin infection for about a year now and it causes me great pain when I stand up for too long, run or skateboard. This job required me to stand up the whole day and walk back and forth with good samples and bad samples and place them in either a neat pile to be packed or the trash. Now after day one I was okay, I could feel the pain creep up a little in my shin but I was alright, I'd had this before and a good night's rest usually solves things. Then day two, I was working for about an hour before the pain set in. From that point of initial pain forward it got bad real quick. By the two hour mark I genuinely couldn't stand up from the pain and I was on the verge of tears. I called my mum and explained to her that I couldn't even stand up and that I would have to quit. She then said these actual words: \"It can't be that bad, just bite through the pain.\" Even after several minutes of explaining that I genuinely couldn't even stand upright because of the pain she still insisted I keep the job and keep working. In the end I told her to go fuck herself and to shove it, because she couldn't feel the pain I was in and didn't have a clue what I felt. So then I finally managed to get home and rest on my bed for the rest of the day. By the evening she came in and started ranting that I should've kept working and bite through the pain. I asked her if my physical well-being was genuinely less important to her than my job and she said yes. \n\nThis happened again during my exams two weeks ago, I was stressed out and had a bit of a breakdown and she told me to suck it up and keep studying. I told her that I would rather jump in front of a train than have to study in such an environment any longer. To which she said that, if that is true, then maybe I'm not fit for my field of study (which is something I've worked hard for and have dreamt of doing for years) \n\nThat is my mother.

            "text": "You asked...\n\nRabies. It's exceptionally common, but people just don't run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.\n\nLet me paint you a picture.\n\nYou go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the \"rage\" stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.\n\nExcept you're asleep, and he's a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don't even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.\n\nRabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won't even tell you if you've got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you've ever been vaccinated.)\n\nYou wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.\n\nThe bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.\n\nIt may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?\n\nAt this point, you're already dead. There is no cure.\n\n(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).\n\nThere's no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.\n\nAbsorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you're symptomatic, it's over. You're dead.\n\nSo what does that look like?\n\nYour headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You're fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your \"pons\" is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.\n\nNext you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn't occur to you that you don't know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.\n\nAs your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it's a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they'll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.\n\nYou're twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what's going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It's around this time the hydrophobia starts.\n\nYou're horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can't drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You're thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that's futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.\n\nYou begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you're having trouble remembering things, especially family.\n\nYou're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you \"drink something\" and crying. And it's only been about a week since that little headache that you've completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.\n\nEventually, you slip into the \"dumb rabies\" phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You're all but unaware of what's around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it's all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven't really slept for about 72 hours.\n\nThen you die. Always, you die.\n\nAnd there's not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.\n\nThen there's the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.\n\nSo yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me. And it's fucking EVERYWHERE. (Source: Spent a lot of time working with rabies. Would still get my vaccinations if I could afford them.)",

All matter, energy, would be utterly annihilated.  There's no way you could see it coming, as no information can travel faster than the speed of light.  You'd just cease to exist.  \n\nThe [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum_decay) quotes the authors of a paper on the subject as saying:\n\n\"The possibility that we are living in a false vacuum has never been a cheering one to contemplate. Vacuum decay is the ultimate ecological catastrophe; in the new vacuum there are new constants of nature; after vacuum decay, not only is life as we know it impossible, so is chemistry as we know it.

This can result in something called strange matter, a kind of \"quark soup\". It has been hypothesized that strange matter is the default state of matter and that should it come into contact with regular matter it would cause the regular matter to decay into strange matter **in a chain reaction** that devours regular matter.\n\nWhen neutron stars with strange matter cores explode, they fire tiny particles of strange matter, called strangelets into space.\n\nThere is a chance, however small, that if a strangelet came into contact with a celestial body, like Earth, it could destroy the entire planet before we would be able to figure out what is going on. We would have no way of knowing it was about to happen. There would be nothing we could do to save ourselves except run away and we don't even know if that's practical. \n\n(Disclaimer: I have no actual idea how quickly this chain reaction might happen.

Species are dying out at a faster rate today than during the Chicxulub impact extinction event. Native trees are dying in Germany, getting to the point where our foresters and landscapers start planting southern Mediterranean trees. Studies from this year raised alarm that we could reach the first \"tipping point\" within the next 5 years.\n\nA tipping point is the thing that's disturbing. That term describes a point In a system or progress that when reached/triggered causes a cascade of reactions. Like when you play around with your chair and reach the point when it tips over and you suddenly lay on your back.\n\nIn terms of earth's climate, known tipping points are the dying of the gulf stream, the dying of rainforests, the melting of seaborne ice and the one thats getting dangerous, the melting of permafrost soils.\n\nUnfathomable amounts if methane are fixated in permanently frozen arctic bogs and soils. If the average temperature on earth rises enough to melt the permafrost, these deposits are released into the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effects themselves, accelerating the thawing itself. Some estimates are that this self feeding feedback loop could alone contribute 1¬∞C or more to the rise global average temperature. At which point it is likely that this sharp raise could trigger the next tipping point.\n\nWorst case scenario: a chain reaction of tipping points that overall result in a raise of global average temperature by 5-6¬∞C by 2100. That's a difference in the ballpark of today vs. 2 km glaciers over Europe, only in the other direction.\n\nLong story short. We could pass the first tipping point within 5 years.

Every single one remind me of the time I was in their shoes, excited and happy to go overseas to serve my country. On my first tour in the ROK, I experienced my first sexual assault while in the military. The bullying, harassment from leadership and mixed signals from peers from that time made it the worst I've ever experienced. Behavior Health was a huge joke and a waste of time. My female leadership reminded me (those who knew) how much I was making them look bad. Even when I attend a leadership course in the last couple of years, one of the girls I served with was in my class. I kept having panic attacks and had to pretend everything was fine. So every time I get my female students asking me to talk about my experiences while in the ROK, I just remind them the mountains are gorgeous and the food is incredible. The ROK for service women is one of the highest places for military sexual trauma. And every time the military pushes a public message about how they're taking sexual assault/rape seriously, I keep it together until I'm in the bathroom at work or back home.

I looked after terminally ill people who had chosen to die at home after being discharged from hospital.\nAfter a while, you learn some telltale signs that people are deteriorating. After a bit longer, you start to learn how long people generally have left - even down to a few hours.\nI always went with honesty, I felt it was my job to support the patients' families as well as the patients, so if they asked how long I thought they had left I would answer honestly (obviously with the disclaimer that I wasn't a doctor and I could only base it on my previous experiences).\n\nThe wife of one of my patients told me that their children (adults) were visiting the following weekend to say their goodbyes. I had to decide carefully on what to say next but I ultimately chose to recommend that they visit the following day, at the latest. I regretted saying it because she was devastated. She took my advice and her husband passed away peacefully 48 hours later, after seeing his kids. I'm glad I did it, but upsetting that lady was absolutely gutwrenching.\n\nSome people didn't want to know, and it was their right not to know. That was the worst. In those cases, you had to not say anything. Sometimes they'd say \"see you tomorrow\" and I had to reply, \"yes, have a good night and I'll see you in the morning\" knowing full well that they were going to pass in the night.\n\nEdit: wow, thank you all for your kind words. It is a very difficult but rewarding job. I am no longer a carer, but I often think about whether I would be able to do it again.\nI've had one question asked a lot in the replies so I'll answer it here;\nDeath, like life, is different for everybody. Certain conditions will cause the body to deteriorate in different ways. \nI'm going to spoiler this next bit because it might be too much for some to read.\n>!COPD was a common condition I saw, that was a gradual decline until the patient could no longer breathe and the oxygen just wasn't able to get in anymore. Heart failure was similar, a very drawn out process.\nI cared for a lot of cancer patients, some younger than my parents which was quite distressing. What tended to happen was the symptoms they already presented would worsen, beyond the point that their medication could alleviate it. They would lose energy, ultimately being bed-bound. The biggest giveaway was when they no longer wanted to drink water, that was usually a 72 hour warning. When they were very close, their skin would start to mottle and go pink/purple. I'm not 100% sure why it happened but I think it was because the heart was struggling to get the blood around and it would settle.\nHowever, generally you could just tell that the person you'd been seeing for days, weeks, months or even years just wasn't the same as they were a few days before. Changes could be gradual or sudden.!<\n\nI went to work with the philosophy that death comes for everybody, if it were me being cared for then I would want to be cared for in a certain way - the way I tried to care for everybody whose homes I entered.",

Prefrontal cortex doesn't develop the same. And if you miss that window there's no intervention that can recover the gap.\n\nI live in South Africa (highest Gini coefficient in the world, highest unemployment, third highest violent crime rate, one of the worst education systems in the world) and it fucking keeps me up at night. I wonder, if we changed nothing except introducing a one nutritious meal per day feeding scheme for ECD, what would happen?\n\nIt hurts.\n\nEdit: firstly, thank you for the awards, comments, and messages. It is truly touching that you are all as moved by this as I am. I am unable to respond to everything, but I appreciate knowing that so many people have felt and thought strongly enough about this to want to participate in changing it.\n\nSecondly: if this has moved you, I encourage you to ask along your networks about ways you can become involved in ECD feeding schemes. Write to relevant congresspeople who oppose such initiatives. There is a lot we can do together as communities. This is a small intervention with such a huge impact. \n\nThirdly: so many of you have asked me for a source. The article I read is [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businesslive.co.za/amp/bd/opinion/2016-11-30-hunger-feeds-high-levels-of-violence/) - I read it in 2017 and it has since been put behind a paywall, although I reverse searched it this year and found it reposted to other sites. The article is written by Dr. Tracy Ledger, a very prominent food security and social and economic reform researcher, whose work is both admirable and important. She is a senior researcher at the Public Affairs Research Institute and the author of a number of publications, articles, and a book titled \"An Empty Plate: Why We Are Losing the Battle for Our Food System, Why It Matters, and How We Can Win It Back\". If you are interested in topics of food and nutritional security and food justice, especially in South Africa, this is a good place to start.\n\nI will share in the comments a few articles that I found while doing research, both in 2017 and this year. They are not all from the highest reputable sources (journal publications), but do reference journal publications or interview prominent people from this field. I hope this helps those of you who are looking for more info. \n\nLastly: Thank you, and bless all of you. Beautiful people.",

Climbing up a tall tree works with adult brown bears, since they can‚Äôt climb trees. \n\nIf it‚Äôs black, fight back. Black bears will back off when they realize you‚Äôre more of a threat than they realize, but DO NOT climb a tree to escape. Both cubs and adult black bears can climb trees. \n\nIf it‚Äôs white, say goodnight. Polar bears are not only the largest bears, but they are ambush predators. If one manages to sneak up on you, you‚Äôre as good as dead. The best you can do to escape is either run and drop your clothes (fortunately for you, they have very short attention spans and they‚Äôll stop momentarily to sniff at your clothes because it‚Äôs not normal for their food to suddenly drop something like that), or start praying to whatever deity you believe or don‚Äôt believe in.\n\nEdit: this is all advice for if the bear decides to try and kill/eat you. Generally speaking, if you *do* come across a bear,  you never, **ever** run away. Stand your ground, make yourself look big and be *loud*. If the bear stands on its hind legs, it‚Äôs just checking you out; it‚Äôs curious and has likely never seen a human before. The best option is to back away slowly while maintaining eye contact, still being loud. If the bear decides to charge, use an air horn or bear spray, which will likely cause to run off. I would to if I just got maced. However, as a last resort, use a gun or other weapon if it becomes aggressive or starts mauling.",

This person arrived with sedatives and provided injection doses which failed to halt the seizures. After 30 minutes after injections started, an hour after seizures started, the seizures ceased. A bed was ordered, we cleaned up and waited. Death arrived but not soon enough. The sister wanted to call 911 at every opportunity.

I went up to this concrete structure, I can't remember the details, I just know it was maybe a foot taller than I. In the concrete there was a hole, rectangle shaped big enough to fit my head through. I stuck my head in to take a look, it was not that wide but it was deep. Just a foot or more down I saw a hand grabbing on to this 1 inch ledge. I was not terribly scared but I tried my best to get my parents to see, in hopes that maybe they could do something. But they didn't believe me and instead we ended up leaving.\n\nNow that I think about it, what if someone was killed, chopped to pieces so the murderer could hide the body?",

While I may have placed a bit much faith in modern medicine, the truth is that making medications and treatments that are 100% effective in every person is impossible in many circumstances, especially when I comes to the brain. While we can aid the body in healing a broken bone or specifically target and destroy many tumors or cancerous growths, there is a lot that we don‚Äôt understand about the human body and how it works. While we can help that bone heal, what happens if there is long term chronic pain associated with the break, joint damage or muscular scarring on the large scale? We can‚Äôt treat pain with much other than highly dangerous opioids, spotty antidepressants or literally deadening nerves. Most alternative treatment involves exercise. Viruses sometimes can‚Äôt be treated and will inevitably kill their host. Drug addiction can absolutely annihilate the human brain in some while others seem unperturbed for the most part. It‚Äôs nice to think if we get hurt or sick that someone can care for us easily, that it‚Äôs just a matter of money, but that‚Äôs not quite true in many cases.

Since an otherwise healthy brain dead person can yield multiple organs (heart, lungs, kidney, liver, and whatever other tissues) their body can be cut up into parts to save more lives than which were lost. \n\nWhen ride sharing services reduced the number of drunk driving accidents, it reduced occurrence of organs becoming available.  In the future if/when something like self driving vehicles reduce the number of car accidents the number of organs that become available decreases, creating even longer waiting lists and time for those dying of organ failure.\n\nUntil we figure out a way to grow human organs in a fast maturing animal or in a lab, if you need a new heart... you will have to wait for someone to die.",

TSMC are the top semi-conductor manufacturers producing 90% of the world's supply of the finest chips. They are located in Taiwan and China is currently performing military drills for an invasion at breakneck pace. They are no longer a paper tiger, that label is shifting to the western alliance. US military estimates are that China will move on Taiwan within 5 years.\n\nThe United States military is second to none and the best equipped, trained and staffed. However top Pentagon brass have publicly stated that quantity (China) can overwhelm quality (US). We have superior aircraft for example, but it would go up against an overwhelming ratio of the inferior jets. Again, the Pentagon has called this a reality. They have projected the US cannot win a war against China fought on the Chinese continent. Chinese hypersonic anti- ship missiles would be impossible to stop.\n\nLooking back at the first and second world wars, they were both entered into with countries knowing full well the losing sides would be split up among the victors. There are existing maps of who would have gotten what after victory was attained. With Russia certainly siding with China, their desire to reunite the old Soviet block would be ample reason to join in. Considerable authoritarian regimes have sprung up around the world, and existing NATO allies are openly squabbling over failure of some to toe the unified line of many issues.\n\nWith recent developments in Afghanistan, one cannot rule out military planners in China moving to strike while the iron is hot. Simultaneous movements in Russia towards old bloc alliances would sorely test the resolve of NATO and a preoccupied US defense of Taiwan.\n\nIs it imminent? Nobody knows and that is the most disturbing thing I can think of on this Sunday that saw the Taliban selling wolf tickets to the USA if it doesn't leave on time. Considering we should have departed in an orderly fashion after Osama Bin Laden was eliminated should be enough of an alarm that we are really not sure what we want to do. And that is precisely what may drive our adversaries to swiftly set a precarious chain of events into motion.",

When the paramedics arrived they were used to dealing with overdoses but not expecting the nose bleeding like it was, because of his nose being smashed in and him bleeding into his Airway and they weren't prepared to deal with the suctioning all of the blood. All of the ambulance workers were with him and I was standing in the hallway with him they asked me to run outside and find the suction pump because there would have been other First Responders outside to help me but when I got outside I was alone with just the ambulance and I left my keys upstairs and I couldn't get back into the building so I was trapped outside of the building with no way of getting the tool that they needed and he drowned to death in his own blood.

Muster is conducted again and they can‚Äôt find this guy, that‚Äôs when I know what happened and felt the biggest elephant on my chest I‚Äôve ever felt in my life.

Also imagine that once you live through every consciousness that has already or will existed, you finally get eternal null-ness (no heaven, no hell, not even \"nothing,\" just null). \n\nOh did I mention that time might be like a tree (or there are alternate universes as many will call it), so you lived/will live through every timeline/universe, including the ones you are not currently in? That whatever could have happened but you didn't experience happening in your current life, it already happened to you or will happen to you in another life?",

The females, now impregnated, eat their way out of their mother's body so that they can emerge to find new thrips eggs.

Garbage patches aren‚Äôt a solid patch.The debris is more like flecks of pepper floating throughout a bowl of soup, rather than a skim of fat that accumulates or sits on the surface. This is absolutely mind-blowing because it makes me think that we might as well have lost our battle against plastic maybe 20 years ago. Microplastics are nearly ubiquitous today in the marine environment and may come from larger pieces of plastic that have broken down over time, from fleece jackets or plastic microbeads added to face scrubs. Present day, we already have traces of these micro plastics appearing in our food chain and people today (in some cases) are also showing signs of organ failure and complications on account of traces of micro plastics I'm their body. This is true, this is happening and we need to do 50x more of whatever it is what we're doing right now to curb the manufacturer and use of single use plastic!\n\nThis happened during sailing because I'm a marine engineer and I sail on container cargo ships like [this](https://youtu.be/y_TOSEd3XMo)\n\nPS: link takes you to a time lapse video I made of our container ship sailing sailing under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco USA",

At 7:20 in the morning on May 19, 1902, there was a devastating explosion that shook the land and sent black smoke billowing out of the mine's mouth. While the reasons are unknown it is estimated that the cause was a result of volatile gases occurring as a result of poor ventilation. These gases were either coal dust or methane. The majority of miners died instantly as a result of the heat and impact, many more died within seconds as a result of suffocation from the toxic fumes. The 26 miners that were not injured but couldn't escape through the mouth of the shaft instead went deeper down snd set up futile barricades to try to keep out the fumes. When the reality set in and they realized they would not survive, many wrote letters to loved ones. A man by the name of Jacob L. Vowell was one of them, and he was with his 14 year old son Elbert. In his letter he wrote: \n\n\"Ellen, darling Good Bye for us both. Elbert said the lord had saved him. Do the best you can with the children. We are all praying for air to support us but it is getting so bad without any air. Horace, Elbert said for you to wear his shoes and clothing. It is now 1/2 past 1.

She would stay up late on the phone dealing with ‚Äúclients‚Äù for work, not care about my work schedule or any acknowledgement. She persuaded me to pay for things left and right (dress, make up, purses, etc) and even to the point she‚Äôs telling me to sell my house and take on maximum debt. She seemed very convincing and I always thought she was looking at trying to build our future together. She even refused to even spending any quality time together. I thought it was all due to the stress of getting eloped. However after a dinner with my parents, they became suspect of her and thought she may have other intentions. One day I asked her if she was willing to sign a non formal agreement/one liner saying we owe our own savings/RRSP/assets prior to the marriage and whatever happens after will be together. She snapped at this and accused me of treating her like a thief. I didn‚Äôt ask her for a prenup, but rather a simple and fair statement saying her assets are hers and my are my prior to the marriage. We weren‚Äôt even going to take it to the lawyers to get a certified. \nShe stormed out but not before emptying everything in my house and leaving away with my garage opener. \nI was in total disbelief and she never called or messaged ever again. Few days later and as I was cleaning out the attic, I found a box of hers in the attic from a long time back. As I was packing it up, I noticed a few pieces of paper stuck in a tax return binder. \nIn there were some of the most darkest stuff I ever saw my in life. It looked to be dated from years ago up until recently and had her ‚Äúdiary‚Äù plan all laid out. She never ever or will ever loved anyone aside from money. It said she must hide her greed and money addiction to seem more professional and high class. She never interned to work hard in her career and her only way to getting rich was to marry and divorce. Some other stuff written includes ‚ÄúWhen thinking of marriage, start thinking of divorce asap. \nBlame the guy on small stuff and escalate to make the man‚Äôs life miserable. Trap him by investing in buying a house (she‚Äôs a realtor after all), and then leave him with half. Do that a few times while I‚Äôm still young (before 35) to maximize my earnings for life. Only sleep with people who can provide value to you. I can never go back to where I immigrated from for fear of my failed last marriage/son. I must learn to be patient to bait my targeted men and not lose my temper‚Äù. There were a lot more in those 6 pages which was a true shocker to me. I never imagined this was the person I was almost about to marry. She was married before and never mentioned about the son. She completely lied to me. She never loved me or anyone else. All she cared about was money. She hide her house asset under her mom‚Äôs name and any chance she gets, she sends most of her earnings overseas. She was just an amazing actress. \nI grew up in a simple family and never have I met someone who was so cold hearted and manipulative. To think I spent more than 2 years with her and almost got married was almost too close. \n\nThis encounter crushed me. I spoke to friends and they were in complete disbelief. It felt like a movie. Apparently this is starting to become a common practice for a lot of foreign asian girls coming from overseas in their late 20s to 30s.\n\nAt the end, I lost quite a bit of money due to the elopement costs and time. However I am very fortunate she lacked the patience and exposed her flaws/emotions before the marriage. I felt like I dodged a bullet.\n\nTL:DR \nalmost married a con artist before her impatience and true character started to reveal.",

Each generation of stars will get smaller until no new stars are created.

They slowly evaporate through a process called Hawking radiation. Usually they are consuming more than they're losing, but at this stage there's nothing to consume.\n\nEventually there will be no more black holes, no stars, no planets, even background radiation will be too redshifted to be detectable.

I wake up with the sun and start working, so who else will give her the medicine regularly?\" said the 25-year-old mother, who has also contracted the virus.\n\nMany families had never heard of HIV, but now it dominates their lives.\n\n\"The government doesn't provide us with antibiotics or multivitamins and we can't afford to buy them ourselves,\" she said.\n\n\"We are doomed\"",

The murder is their fantasy, many report having an orgasm without any stimulation and others confirm only being able to sustain arousal by inflicting harm on others, far beyond the confines of BDSM.\n\nFinally, the insanity plea does not apply to serial killers, despite many attempting it.

In that place It is a usual practice to dig wells without permit to get some water from under the soil. Usually if no water is fountld the well is covered up, but Alfredino's neighbors dug the hole and never covered it up, making it a deadly trap.\n\nAlfredino was returning to home when he fell into the well his parents became upset because he didn't return before 20:00 and by 21:30 they called the police and some minutes after came some paramedics, firefighters and some other neighbors. They used some dogs to help find Alfredino it was at that time that his grandma suggested that he fell into a well digged by a neighbor. The brigadeer of the police knew this well, but he though it was covered by some sheet metal and rocks. When they came to the well they discovered it was indeed covered, but that happens 1 hour after Alfredino fell.\n\nWhen the uncovered the well the heard the feeble whines of Alfredino, the owner of the well was later arrested with the accusation of murder.\n\nThe rescuers estimated that Alfredino was stuck at about 36 meters in depth the rescue instantly turned to be extremely difficult, the well had a diameter of 28 centimeters and a depht of 80 meters with irregular walls.\n\nThe first attempt tu rescue failed because the wire snapped and left a piece of iron stuck in the middle of the well totally obstructing it.\n\nBy 1 am some RAI (italian state television) tecnicians arrived and inserted a wired microphone in the well to talk to Alfredino, who was still conscius.\n\nThey though that they could dig a well parallel to the other one and making a perpendicular hole to retrieve Alfredino, but to do that they needed a driller, which arrived at 6:00.\n\nBy 4:00 some spelologists offered themselves to descend in the well and help remove the metal bar but neither of the two was able to get near enough to remove it.\n\nAfter the failed attempt, the firefighters started pumping oxygen in the well to avoid Alfredino to asphyxiate. After that the commander of the firefighters ordered to drill another well parallel to the \nOriginal one. After some time the firefighters requested a bigger and powerful driller to penetrate through the granite.\n\nAfter some time a lot of people started coming to see what was happening and even Sandro Pertini, the president came. After some time they passed a tube to bring water and sugar to Alfredino. \n\nAfter the drilling started aflfredino slipped some meters further because of the vibrations. \n\nAll the attempts to retrieve hi were failed and by 9:00 of the 13 of June he died of hypothermia, his corpse was refrigerated with liquid nitrogen to prevent decomposition and after that they were finally able to retrieve his corpse.",

By September 4, 2016, there had been as many as 3,204 of them. These numbers are truly terrifying.\n\nOther countries have a large number of identified serial killers, but the US figure is considerably higher than any other. In the same timeframe, there had been 166 serial killers in England. South Africa and Canada follow with 100+ serial killers.\n\nThere‚Äôs more to it, though:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, these numbers include only serial killers who were caught. But what about the grand total?\n\n10. According to ‚Äúserial-killer detector‚Äù Thomas Hargrove, there are more than 2,000 active serial killers in the US.\n(Source: The New Yorker)\n\nSince not all serial killers get caught and identified, it‚Äôs impossible to say exactly how many serial killers are unknown. Thomas Hargrove, a  homicide archivist who painstakingly collected records on 751,785 murders carried out in the US since 1976, created an algorithm to track unsolved murders.\n\nBased on this algorithm, he argued that there are as many as 2,000 active serial killers.

The doctor didn't know what was wrong, then he told Eben that a new medicine came out called \"Radithor\" that can help with the pain. Eben wanted to try it out so his doctor gave him a prescription for it. After Eben took his first spoonful of Radithor, he started to feel real energetic and the pain in his arm started to go away a bit. Here on, Eben started to take Radithor more, and more (3 bottles per day), and then out of nowhere, his jaw just straight up fell off! It just disconnected from his skull. So he got it surgically removed. here on, his bones would start to 'wither away' in a sense. Until he died in 1932. Then it was found it that Radithor was just radioactive water. Water with Radium in it. And since Eben took so many bottles of Radithor, he had to be buried in a lead-lined coffin. Then when they checked the radioactive levels of Eben's body, it was found out that there was so much Radium un it, that his bodt would remain radioactive for a whole century! A few years after his death, Radithor was put offsale and they stopped manufacturing it.",

Around 4 years back one thief was caught there. Police checked his phone and they were looking for some clues about a  small robbery incident. When his phone was checked there were rape videos of about 40+ woman. Its not uncommon but all of them had almost the same location. So police asked him hardly. He broke and the story which got out was this: So these local guys who were theives were raping and looting young couples from last some years. And they used to make videos of them to blackmail so that the couples don't report the looting and raping incidents. There were 50+ such cases that happened. All the locals of that small town knew about it. In many cases the girls clothes were torn off and the local ladies had to give them cloths. Many times the boys had to be admitted to hospital because of the severe beating by this theives along with girls. All of this happened but that's not the most f*cked up part. The most shit part is all of these gang of theives walked free without any time. It was because none of the victims came forward reporting that it was done with them. Many later posted self stories about it on social media but nobody went and reported it. All the locals knew it happened. Even the police knew it happened. But those a*Sholes walked free.

If you're religious, the sole purpose in life is to be a good person, try and live happily, and not take the easy way out while just biding your time till death to either get to hell, \"reroll\" and be born anew, or get into heaven which will answer the real meaning on why we exist which goes way beyond our mortal minds. So basically, the sole purpose of life is to die of external causes and just passing your time while also sticking by the rulebook to progress in existence and find out what it's really about, and if you're not religious, life technically has no meaning because you're just gonna die anyway. So in a way, you're f*cked regardless because it all ends in \"we're just biding our time till death\", but cannot take the easy way out since suicide is basically the forbidden cheat code that will get you banned from the server (the one unforgivable sin).\nIn a way, the purpose of life is to just be a good person until you die and progress to stage two, which can go in three hypothetical separate was, but only one truly progresses, while the others either cancel you out or send you back to square one. As to what happens after that, there's no way of knowing until we're there, so we just need to be patient, be good, live our lives to the fullest, and wait till the universe decides it's our time to go. Basically the sole purpose of life is to die, but never do it by your own hands and do your best to make every second count. (AKA: Don't go around starting a goddamn death cult because that's screwed up and not what I mean at all. this opinion and entire reply which is mostly me thinking out loud at 3am pondering into a reply section for disturbing things to know, but to be honest, if you truly understand this it won't affect you much because you basically just live life the way you currently are, just try and be a good person.
