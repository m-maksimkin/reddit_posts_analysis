There's literally no excuse to not only look up what you're claiming, but also look into where that information came from.\n\nProper fact checking is not only looking up the fact itself, but where you got that information, the legitimacy of the website/authors that are giving you that quote, and what makes those said sources valid for giving you that information in the first place. You can go to Wikipedia and get reliable information nowadays, but even then you should be checking the references that THE ARTICLE ITSELF sourced from, not just the Wikipedia article in itself, if you want to take what you're saying seriously.\n\nI've had to talk with multiple people about what proper fact checking is; because without doing that, you get situations like anti-vax where people didn't even bother to check the legitimacy of the paper just because they took that quack doctors word for it. People just don't want to put into the effort to make sure they're actually, y'know, right? It's a lot of work, but it's work that you have to put in to properly fact-check. \n\nNow if you don't really care that much then by all means, shoot the shit, no harm done.

            "text": "Homelessness in the United States.\n\nOne of the main arguments people make to excuse things like housing, poverty, and hunger, is that there's a scarcity. At least as much as I've looked into it with housing, that is not correct.\n\nAll of this information I'm about to use is coming from https://www.census.gov and my own (admittedly dyscalculiac) math. (Hopefully got this right here).\n\nThere are roughly 332,580,000 Americans in the United States. Presumably, some of us want to live alone, but many others don't. Many of us have families, kids, spouses, lovers, friends, people we enjoy living with, so take that into consideration here.\n\nAccording to census.gov, based on original numbers represented in \"thousands of units,\" there are an estimated total of __*141,794,000*__ units of housing in the United States, leaving aside the fact that many are of course occupied, owned, tied up with banks, etc.\n\nLet's think about that a moment.\n\nIf we divide a US population of 332,580,000 by the total number of housing units that exist, which is 141,794,000, we get 2.345515325.\n\nTo put it another way, if we divided up all of the housing units in the United States so that \"the exact same number of people will live in every home,\" you get two horrified humans looking at and living with just shy of ⅖ths of a person.\n\nJokes and morbid hypotheticals that prove statistics are sometimes relentlessly removed from reality aside, the key here is that as I've said, *most people will want to live in a household that's greater than or equal to 2.*\n\nMany would obviously want to live alone, but with the sheer number of people who will want to live in groups no matter what, I'm not too concerned about the \"lone wolves\" ruining this for the numbers we've gotten here.\n\nI'm pretty sure nobody is surprised with where I'm going with this, but this proves this issue with housing is not scarcity, it's hoarding. These properties exist. Many are not being lived in, and while I'm certain many of those are condemned as health hazards or any number of other total losses, most aren't. Most are just sitting there, not being lived in, because nobody can afford it.\n\nThese costs are a cruel pretense when we're talking about people who are trying to survive violence, inclement weather conditions, hunger, and any number of horrors you can imagine.\n\nThe really fucked up thing is that people are *okay* with that here. There's this classist, just world fallacy attitude about homelessness, that says that if they're homeless, they probably did something to deserve it. I'm sorry, but I've made loads of really fucking shitty life decisions, I'm pretty sure everyone has-- do people deserve to be unsafe because of that?\n\nI fully expect fans of capitalism are going to be quick to call this Not Capitalism, and my best response is probably \"yes, that's the idea.\"\n\nBecause capitalism is what enables the hoarding of these kinds of resources. There is no person who *doesn't* deserve access to housing. Not one. If that means I'm endorsing the very communist idea of \"the redistribution of wealth,\"  by saying that human rights should be... y'know, a default given to people, not a privilege to be taken away, endangering people... I guess I'm a communist. (I'm somewhere in that lower left quadrant, lol).\n\nI would sort of understand if we just didn't have the housing units to support that kind of idea, but we do. I'm mathematically disabled and was able to figure this out pretty quickly (after catching myself a few times accidentally transposing or adding digits). I'm not usually very confident in my math, so people of Reddit, go easy on me if I got it wrong lol (and do feel free to check me, I got all of my data through census.gov).\n\nIf I'm right, it's not that we don't have enough to go around, we just have greedy fucks who don't know how to share, and feel like people getting the bare minimum they need to survive is a threat to them. \n\nThis theory wouldn't have to displace or relocate anyone who is already housed (with or without others living with them), all it does is put roofs over the heads of people who *don't* have a place to live.\n\nThis is all data from the year 2021, and there's not one good reason why it continues.",

            "text": "Oh boy. There's a lot of shit. Let's start with what can be most damaging. \n\nAlgorithms. They are meant to show you glimpses of people's lives and shows only the good thus causing a comparison issue due to the one seeing the stuff maybe feeling they aren't where they're suppose to be in life yet. This has lead to a 1500% increase(since 2012 to 2020) of minors or young people killing theirselves, bodily harm, or other mental illnesses. Algorithms are busted and drive deeper into depression and spread false information extremely well. \n\n FBI. They don't do shit. If they want funding and want to be seen as a good force of the law then take down child pedos take down drug trafficking rings sex trafficking rings arms dealers. Instead we get them staging shit to make theirselves look good. Just do actual work and everyone will love the FBI. I mean shit you have the resources to go anywhere anytime in the USA. Yes I get some of these criminals are out of the USA. Correspond with other agencies and get them taken down. Nobody wants their country to be ruined by violence drugs and have their children steadily being taken and not seen again. \n\nThis is one for the US specifically. The 2 party system. Is bullshit that any other party has to get x amount of votes the election before they ran in order to get time to debate and share their views with all citizens on live TV. All we see are dems and reps \"debating\" during election years. Well I guess this can go for all countries that do this. \n\nAnd the last one on my little rant(apologies for being so long) The steady division from everywhere. We are all the same species we need to come together with a common goal. Save the planet and colonize the galaxy. We have so so many smart and talented people in this world that get overlooked due to where they come from. There are people out there that have no clue how smart they truly are just bc of their life circumstances. There's no need for wars. No need for violence. Yes I get there are evil ppl out there that can't stand x country or whatever. Stop put it aside and let's work together. Why bicker and fight and ruin the only planet we can live on(for now) for future generations. Idk about yall I prefer humanity to not go extinct. I 100000% won't be around for the end of humanity(well hopefully) and so I won't see how it ends. I rather it not end in my children's lifetime and let them have the chance to be able to see the galaxy travel the world do whatever they desire and not have to worry about someone blowing them up bc they don't like that country or those type of people. \n\nSorry for the rant but theres a lot the world needs to change and put aside. Another would be world hunger that the UN can solve(3 billion so they claim will solve world hunger) but yet nobody wants to make a move towards that. Jeff Bezos can literally feed the world not even truly notice the money missing and make it back instantly plus good publicity but nope.",

We had just walked passed my neighbors house when we came across a building to our right. There were five adults on the porch. As soon as we were in their peripheral, one of the men say, “What is that *n-word* boy doing on our street”. \n\nMe and my friend looked at each other and he goes, “Did he really just say that?” while we looked back at them as we passed by. The man takes it a step further and said, “Those two white boys aren’t going to save you now.” \n\nWe could not believe it. My friend does not enjoy confrontation. We thought that we would let it go until they began to follow us. We cut through my neighbors yard and went back to my house. As soon as we got their, we told my older brother what had happened and my father overheard. He was not happy.\n\nHim and my uncle went to their building and no one was there. They retreated inside. My father knocked and knocked. After two minutes someone answered the door. They had denied every saying a word to us. \n\nMy father shared some words - not kind nor gentle - but he did share words. They have never bothered us again. I live in a small community and never thought I would have to deal with racism. It is everywhere and it is a disease.",

We need fax machines at work for the sole reason of getting communications from our finance companies. \n\nI understand why some places are reticent to switch to alternatives like docusign and so on, but only *just barely*. With docusign and the like, the only assurance that both parties have that the signatory and source are the ones that are *supposed* to handle those documents is a sort of trust that only one person is accessing that email address and isn't careless with their password. But then, with fax, you have less assurances than even that, because an entire office of people or, depending on the location of the fax machine, anyone and their mother could walk in and access that fax. Also, neither method works for certain types of documents because the recipient will only take original signatures on paper, but ... seriously. We don't need fax machines. We have email, and text message, and if you're super paranoid about data security, physical keys.",

While publishers would male less revenue they would also cut huge production costs that involve tons of steps from materials to shipping, to graphic designers and editors, distributors and losses due to printing errors, theft, fires, etc. They can just update their digital copies as needed at a fraction of the cost.

Here in the UK you can get an exemption card which means all of your meds are entirely free if you have certain conditions. However, the only way to get these is to go in person to a doctor's surgery, pick up a form, fill half of it out with your details, then give it back to the surgery to confirm your half and fill out the rest, then send it off in the post. This, despite the fact that we have an app that holds all your healthcare info and can be used to order prescriptions. Like, if you can order drugs for your condition on an app, why can't you order the card through it too, or just have an e-certificate? We managed it with covid vaccinations.\n\nEven more annoying, afaik all of the conditions that get the exemption are permanent, yet the card only lasts 5 years. So you have to reapply every 5 years and confirm that yes, you do still have that life-long condition.",

I went to the venue to buy them in person but their “machine” is down- they said it should be fixed in a couple of weeks.  Went back- still not fixed.  They said to wait until day of and buy the tickets at the door for the same price as the online ticket plus service charge.  WTF? Convenience fees are bulls****.

You think [slur]town was bad? That subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don't even bother with that-- say want you want about Stormfront, at least it bans \"n[slur]\"), will reveal itself to you as Reddit's number one hub for the web's most hardened Nazis, Klansmen, Fascists, and Gamergaters. You'll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as dramatic as possible. That's intentional. They encourage arguments in the comments section. That's intentional. You know the Three Minute Hate (it's from this underrated book 1985, give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these evil feelings. They brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement. They've kink-shamed hundreds of people too, some even... to death. I fear that /r/drama may be producing an entire army of Dylann Roofs and Elliot Rogers, and I highly suggest that nobody dares visit that horrible subreddit, lest you potentially fall victim to its corruptive aura.",

Humans can be naturally self destructive but by nature we also try to help each other up and prefer to see each other succeed. No more of this party line crap, no more letting politicians divide us based on color, sex, or religion, just us coming together and stopping this division and tearing each other down based on blanket statements.",

So take it with a grain of salt. \n\nFrom my experience, it seems that a lot of Girl Scout troops teach girls how to be women of the 1950s, basically how to be a housewife, instead of actually skillful. For example, Girl Scouts is very similar to Boy Scouts in terms of having a similar rank system, having an equivalent to Eagle, and even having leadership roles and outdoor skills they need.  However the biggest difference is that while BSA is more scout lead, Girl Scouts is almost entirely parent lead. \n\nMy best example is that one day my BSA troop had a combined meeting with our churches Girl Scout troop. And in the meeting we taught their younger scouts how to start a fire. A very important skill to have, that anyone of any gender can do. Now we teach using EDGE in scouts (explain demonstrate, guide, enable) and so we guided them and demonstrated it. We were about to guide them through doing it themselves when the Girl Scout parents came in, put out our fire, and said “ok very good, now remember girls only adults can make fire” like wtf, they need to know how to make fire, let these girls make a fire safely and don’t tell them that they can’t do it. It turned out they even made another fire using lighter fluid, and had all the girls make s’mores at their fire because they thought we wouldn’t beable to make a fire since we were not adults. \n\nHonestly this is why I believe so many girls wanted to be in BSA, because Girl Scouts isn’t teaching girls how to be leaders, instead teaching them how to be housewife’s which is stupid. \n\nGirl Scouts either needs to start teaching them how to be leaders, or drop the program.",

Also people expecting tips. Also additional thing. Sales tax not being directly integrated into the items like it is in Europe (I think the European Union not Europe as a whole). Like in the UK I can just go up to a shop pick up what I want do some quick mental math and be like \"yeah I can afford this stuff\". Afaik from people I know who live in the US especially sales tax is a pain in the ass as it can vary from store to store and shit like that as well as being unpredictable in general meaning you could have nowhere near enough money and realise right at the end. Seems like countries the USA helped after WW2/1 are doing much better than them themselves as they for some reason can't implement shit to mimic good properties or Europe?",

Giant houses and fancy townhouses along the beach mostly owned by rich white folks and then just a few streets inward and the city becomes insanely cramped with people living on top of each other, largely black and latino but with a healthy smattering of the rest of the world. Including my life long best friend. White, single mother, scraping to get by. \n\nAs I've said in one of my other replies, I recognize that everyone's life is different and experiences are different. God knows that poor woman has been through hell and back. Abuse, poverty, abandonment, you name it. But she and I have also talked about how much worse things could have been for her if she had been a latina like me or black. She and her daughter went out and marched with Black Lives Matter. We donated together after there were riots that hurt some of our local businesses. She does what she can.\n\nThe thing that's hard to avoid is that, at least in the US, the privileged 1% who hoard the wealth that even now people swear will trickle down as billionaires blast into space for shits and giggles, the people who hold the most power and persuasion are white.\n\nRepresentation for other races and ethnicities in higher levels of most industries is still painfully low. Black executives are few and far between and when they do make it to the board it's in roles like Chief Diversity Officer. It's laughable. \n\nWhether people like the term or not, there is a certain amount of advantage that comes from simply being better represented on the most basic levels.",

The red lining and denial of credit to black families who were the children and grandchildren of slaves wasn't an accident.  Geography dictates history as it always has even before written language existed. If you deny one group access to decent quality geographic areas, then they will be worse off than those who turned them away. Sure, families theoretically can get credit and access the geographic areas on paper, however the resources accumulated from those who had access generations before overvalue the resources and keep certain groups out. This is the argument for reparations.  I neither agree nor disagree outright but wonder what ideas and practices come out from being aware of it. As the great great great granddaughter of a slave owner from the county next door to where I live and my family estate was built during the time of the red lining as well as the prior owner was friends with one of the most outspoken racist congressmen who also had a guest bed here for him at the time we got the house 30 years ago,, this is an uncomfortable reality I have to live with. It's not a coincidence a professor from a small college could so easily get a large estate in the premium part of town while across the rail road tracks looks like a developing country after a war. Sure, capital gains tax can be a pain in the ass, but if it went towards addressing the inequalities that people like my ancestors and literal neighbors before we got the property created,  I would petition for it with passion.  \n\n\n\n\nSide note-Also, ironically,  my mom adopted a man who is the son of a former sex slave and she helped him start his anti-human trafficking ngo and he is every bit of a brother to me as a blood sibling or someone adopted as a minor. Since she recently passed, he was listed as one of the heirs and now the sale of the property will free people from cages and the most unbelievably inhumane conditions. Granted, what happened in the history leading up to us getting the property was completely evil, but at least we are helping free slaves today.  If you want info on the NGO, LMK.",

Pro tip: use Privacy.com, best thing I've ever found (I'm not affiliated with them in anyway, just a huge fan). Hook it up to your bank and they'll generate you legitimate 'smart' credit card credentials to use online in place of your real ones.\n\nI use the dummy card for when I sign up for a gym, a subscription, anything online. Then, if they won't let me cancel easily/online, I simply go to privacy and change the limit on the card to zero or delete it entirely. Takes 5 seconds. No fuss, no worrying if New York Sports Club is going to try to charge me again even though I called to cancel AND sent them a physical letter. Highly recommended\n\nCompanies making it extrodinarily difficult to cancel in modern day is the equivalent of someone putting their hands over their ears when someone's trying to break up with them.

Let me get a ring and I'll propose to you.\" He was in Paris when he proposed the 'traditional' way and he argued that when the guy proposes, it gives \"his woman the important feeling of validation. \\[And also\\] helps her feel chosen, wanted and cherished.\" \n\nNow, I'm generally a open-minded, live-and-let-live kind of person. I understand there are more conservative/traditionalist values out there.\n\nBut I'm pretty sure this was an SF Gate article, and my first thought was \"Jeez man, it's 2021! Isn't it more important that someone has a genuinely loving, lasting relationship? Who cares who proposed first?\" More importantly, the whole thing felt obviously sexist and unfair. It's not important for a guy to feel loved, chosen and cherished during a romantic moment? If a woman makes a grand gesture and puts herself out there, it's somehow invalid?

She continued that petty attitude for 2 more months I was ready to quite but I knew my mom would be pissed so I just shortened my days so I only worked 3 days. \n\nMy manager was pissed but I didn’t care. My mom didn’t question my lack of work days and I quite the moment I turned 18 and started an online business selling my services with editing. I also got a part time job that paid more than the other and I didn’t mind my coworkers.
