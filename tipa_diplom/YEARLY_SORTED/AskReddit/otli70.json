Some things are disheartening to hear but sometimes I think it's just my partner's insecurities and cultural background blinding him to feel like a \"man\" in ways that confuse me.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nY'all, thank you so much for taking the time to respond! I do feel embarrassed asking these questions to friends and family members, but I appreciate how everyone took the time to really give me some insight from the male perspective (even the Mulan and Chris Rock reference! :D ). \n\nAs a female with an amazing man, I always wanted to be that pillow and comfort for my partner because I know life can be tough, regardless of gender, but I wanted to understand my partner more (he can be a closed book sometimes haha) and see if there is anything I can help him with emotionally since he has a lot going on as head of household for his entire family. After so many years where I was not allowed to show emotion with my parents (cry, complain, anger), I think I took for granted that I can be emotional at any time in my life, but males who are emotional or unstable at any age are socially deemed 'weak' or 'unmanly'. Regardless, as mentioned in the comments, y'all are still humans! I am going to continue absorbing all your responses because there is so much in y'all's messages <3\n\nAnyway, this was very therapeutic and helpful for me and I wish the best to all you guys! :)",

And when you bring this up, obviously angry, they tell you they can’t “understand your behavior” — As in, being upset about weeks of zero contact is somehow outrageous. What is that? Am I crazy for expecting the person to want to spend time with me? Or be excited about a relationship? \n\nBasically, what should my expectations be?\n\nAnswers to possible follow up questions:\n1. I expect a relationship to be give and take, and I love doing stuff for special events/holidays.\n2. I would like these efforts to be reciprocated \n3. Yes, I do give the person space — but after 3+ weeks of no contact, I’m a bit on edge. \n4. This is probably not an issue with men in general, but clearly an issue with the ones I’ve dated.\n\nEdit: yes, we were dating\n\nEdit2: when I broke things off, his response was: “I completely understand, I wish you luck in life”",

To summarize what I have learned: it seems it is a learned coping mechanism MOST men can do, but it is not necessarily specific to men (just more common I think). To clarify where I come from, I personally feel more stressed when I am trying to avoid something that is on my mind. If I personally force distraction, I end up being out of it 50+% of the time and miserable all the time. My ex couldn't understand why I got pissed every time he tried to divert a serious/emotional conversation to something more uplifting, but that's just how I function. :) I do not speak for all women, I may just be weird!",

It makes me feel happy, confident, and excited to look in the mirror, and in turn, myself.\n\n...and I certainly have read comments about men saying how its unattractive to care a lot about how you look, wear bright makeup, have instagram in the first place, enjoy taking photos of yourself, \\[fill in the rest of the blanks here\\]. As much as I wish I could say that these comments don't faze me, they really do :/so finally the question: where do you draw the line between \"image-obsessed/living in social media\" women (bad) versus women just using it? I know I embody some of those traits, when is it \"too much\"?\n\nEDIT: should have clarified this earlier but my version of editing photos is with light and color curves, different settings, maybe a grain or film filter, and taking out a couple light switches and outlets- not editing my face or body",

His family are very stoic and they've made fun of me in the past for being open about my mental health issues and how I talk to people about how I feel. They have also made comments like \"when my son was depressed I just told him to kill himself and he stopped crying over it\". It was a serious comment. \n\nHow can I reassure him that I'm not like that and I will listen without judgement? I've told him I won't hold what he says against him and I only want to help but it doesn't seem to have reassured him any. \n\nHis nan passed on earlier this year, and he's held his grief in. I'm worried that if he doesn't process this properly and reach out for support it will impact him negatively long term, but there's a lot of stigma around men being emotional and getting support and I know that words alone aren't going to reverse 20 years of stigma and a subpar primary support system.",

He's a wonderful man and seems very understanding/compassionate when we talk about other issues in our life and the world. I've been through counseling and therapy at the start of the divorce and a few years after that and emotionally, I'm in the best place! Plus, I don't dwell on what happened. So in preparing for the inevitable sex, i started pelvic floor therapy so I won't be so tense and tight even more to the point where it  would be too painful for both of us. So I'm asking you all out here if all of that is too much to share at this point in our relationship? Should I just not tell him anything and hope for the best? I think he's getting curious as to why I tense up soo much when he tries to touch me below the belt so I'm gonna have to tell him something and soon. Now I just say I'm nervous. I don't have any issues kissing him or having my body touched/massaged and I love going down on him and giving him lots of oral. He likes that . Thanks for the male perspective.
