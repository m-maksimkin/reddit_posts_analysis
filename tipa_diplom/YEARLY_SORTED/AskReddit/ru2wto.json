            "text": "“Eat what you see the animals eat”—  It is indeed good advice, when used correctly. But only when used correctly.  It’s the first step in a line of tests, NOT the only test. \n\nTL;DR: The rule doesn’t apply to meat.  Eat only what plants you see the little fragile animals (birds/bunnies) eating.  Then eat it only in tiny amounts at first. \n\n“Eat what the animals eat” is indeed helpful advice—but only for eating vegetation.  And it mostly only  applies to birds and rabbits eating plants and berries (any vegetation), mimic them.  It isn’t 100% foolproof, but it’s definitely 1 layer of elimination “this berry probably isn’t good if birds won’t eat it” is solid advice, etc.\n\nThis is because birds and rabbits are very delicate creatures, they are way more fragile than humans.  If it kills a bird or a rabbit, it’ll definitely harm a human.\n\nCoal miners used to use the same logic, and use canaries lowered into mine shafts to test for poisonous gas—if it kills the bird, it’ll kill the human.\n\n“Eat what the animals eat” does not apply for carnivorous animals.  Do not mimic them.  A wolf/coyote/bear mountain lion has been designed to eat rotten meat.  You haven’t.\n\nThe further steps for finding non-poisonous vegetation:\n\n1.\t⁠What do the fragile animals eat?  (What do birds and rabbits eat?) copy them\n2.\t⁠Gather some of that item.  However DO NOT EAT IT YET!!!!\n3.\t⁠crush a little of the item, and then rub some of that juice on your lips.  NOT inside your mouth—just on the outside of your lips.  Wait one hour.\n\nIf your lips feel a burning sensation, feel pain, or go numb—that means the food is poisonous.\n(This happened to a friend of mine. She ate some mystery berries, and her mouth and tongue went numb. That’s when I knew she had poisoned herself. Some toxins can cause things to feel numb.)\n\nIf that happens, don’t eat the item.  Aren’t you glad you didn’t gulp it down?\n\n4) How to proceed if the berries didn’t burn/hurt/numb your lips:  now place JUST ONE PIECE in your mouth (like 1 berry.  Or 1 leaf).  Hold it in your mouth.  DO NOT SWALLOW. Hold it in your mouth for 20-30 minutes.  Then spit it out.  Wait an hour.  Repeat the test: does it burn/hurt/numb inside your sensitive mouth?   If it did, it’s poisonous, aren’t you glad you didn’t subject your stomach to that?  Yes, yes you are.\n\n5) If it didn’t hurt/numb your mouth?  Congrats! Swallow ONE BERRY or ONE LEAF.  Again, a tiny amount, so if it is poisonous, you don’t kill yourself.  Wait one hour.  Is your stomach stabbing in pain?  Did you throw up?  If yes—don’t eat the rest, it’s poisonous.  Aren’t you glad you listened to me and you only ate that tiny amount?\n\n6) If the 1 hour test passes and your stomach is fine—eat MORE.  But again, same rule: DONT gulp down a huge amount.  Eat maybe a tablespoon or 1 ounce.\n\nSame reasons as before.\n\n7) If more time passes and your stomach is fine?  Then eat more.  Maybe a handful.\n\nEtc.  gradually increase the size of the plant/berry, until you know it’s safe.\n\nTa-da!",

Lichen just likes to grow in shade, so in the northern hemisphere, that tends to be the north side of a tree trunk--or literally anywhere else that's in the shade. It doesn't happen predictably enough that I would take a bearing from it, especially if you can't tell the difference between moss and lichen.\n\nThe truth is, humans are hilariously bad at finding their way in wilderness, and in any case, unless you have a very good idea of where you're going and a very good reason to go there, most of the time you'll be better off staying put.

If you're native to the US, most of the venomous snakes here will literally warn you to leave them the hell alone with their body language or by hissing or rattling. So if a snake is getting shitty with you, just take heed and walk away. I promise, they won't chase you, no matter what cousin cletus told you about water moccasins or whatever other silly myths you've heard.  \nSecond, 99% of the US's venomous snakes have what's called hemotoxic venom. Basically means it causes local tissue damage. If you apply suction force to the wound, not only will you not suck out any poison, you'll be causing further damage by aggravating the wound site, and likely make the tissue damage a lot worse.  \nThe only snake in the US with neurotoxic venom (the kind that shuts down your CNS) is the coral snake. Coral snakes are small, rare, extremely shy, don't deliver their venom with fangs, and don't typically use biting for defense. You'd basically have to hunt one down, poke its face until you got it to actually try to bite, and then let it chew on your finger for a bit.  \n\n\nAs my herpetology professor would say \"if you died from a Coral snake bite, that was a suicide\"",

Bear spray is far more effective then any gun in a bear attack. Imagine a 600 pound bear charging you at 35 mph. How good of a shot do you think you'd have to be to stop that bear before it gets to you? And what if you don't kill it one shot? That bear now has adrenaline rushing through its body on top of its already insane strength. \n\nBear spray, however, will stop that bear and cause it to run off. All of the studies show that bear spray is far more effective at stopping charging bears.\n\nEdit: For Everyone asking about those studies, here are some articles that do an exception explaining why bear spray is more effective.\n\nhttps://outsidebozeman.com/node/1414\n\nhttps://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/exploration-survival/shoot-or-spray-best-way-stop-charging-bear/\n\nI grew up hiking and backpacking in Montana/Wyoming in and around Yellowstone. I've spent a ton of time in the back country in Grizzly country. I've gone out with hunters, guides, search and rescue folks, wildlife biologists, and every other kind of expert you can imagine. They'll all tell you the same thing. Bear spray is more effective.",

The idea is that removing it is like uncorking a wine bottle, and you're just going to cause the person to bleed more. Plus, pulling the object out can cause additional tearing damage if it's jagged or oddly shaped.\n\nI remember this from my old Boy Scout handbook (I think) and first aid training, and it showed how to wrap the wound and pad the object (but make sure your wraps don't press down on the object) to prevent it from moving while you move the injured person. But they also said you often shouldn't move the person unless you have to, depending on the injury's severity of course.\n\nBut it's been a long time since I was taught that, so maybe techniques have changed?\n\nEither way, it's always ridiculous when I see someone get shot in a movie, and people try to dig out the bullets.

In case anyone's wondering, they actually  DID do many things correctly, after getting  lost.\n I think Mr. Kim left the vehicle out of panic for his family (nothing - NOTHING- makes you fear Death more than finally  having a life you would DIE for!). While he died, his wife and child lived because they stuck to the car, and left many visuals for  helicopter pilot John Rachor to track. \n\nI have NEVER believed in \"pointless\" lives or deaths- nor coincidences (pilot discovered location on a \"hunch\"). I FRANKLY believe Mr. Kim's death may have already saved enough lives to formally make his death a Noble one.\n\nEDIT 2:  Awesome find, mcarterphoto !!:\nhttps://www.outsideonline.com/2152131/freezing-death/",

Like a thousand rattlesnakes. Within 30 seconds we were watching trees get plucked up into the air. \n\nWe all made it out alright. Luckily there was a large ravine that was dry that time of year and we scrambled into it and flattened out gripping to each other and rocks for dear life. \n\nIt took 30 seconds from the time we realized it was in front of us till it was ontop of us. \n\nLater in life I watched a F3 touch down. Because how tornados spin and the earth spins, and I was traveling at 75mph down a highway. I thought I was running along side it. About 1 mile from it. I couldn't hear it, I could see trees and barns going up into the air with it. I never realized it was coming towards me at about 30mph. By the time I heard it and felt a pressure change inside the cab of my truck I had no choice but to bail out and run into a culvert along side the interstate. This all happened within 60 seconds. If you've already heard the tornado. You need to be in your shelter. Not heading towards it. \n\nA tornado watch is an advisory to be watching for tornados.

This is important. In hospital we NO LONGER NEED to know the type of snake; it doesn’t change treatment. 5 years ago we would do a test on the bite, blood or urine to identify the snake so the correct anti venom can be used. BUT NOW… we don’t do this. Our new Antivenom neutralises the venoms of all the 5 listed snake genus, so it doesn’t matter what snake bit the patient. Read that again- one injection for all snakes! Polyvalent is our one shot wonder, stocked in all hospitals, so most hospitals no longer stock specific Antivenins.\"\n\nEdit: Added source reference.\n\nEdit2: Thanks vm for the awards, wow!  - also changed antivenom to its correct term, 'antivenin'.\n\nEdit3 (common questions in thread):\n\n* Does this work for spiders too?  - not that I can tell. The official guidelines are published per Australian State. They all seem to agree on the following regarding hospital treatement of snake bites:  *If the type of bite can be determined by analysis at the hospital and the monovalent antivenin is available, use it. Otherwise use the polyvalent (universal) antivenin.*\n* Is this available in other countries? - I do not know, I have only researched here and I am sharing what I have found as an Aussie with no medical qualifications. If you research your own country's info, I suggest you include, \"polyvalent\" in your search.\n* First Aid advice in all States includes, \"do not clean the wound or remove any clothes.\"\n* Example of offical procedure: [https://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/85950800457e1fda87c5d7519b2d33fa/SnakebiteSpiderbiteGuidelinesSA-SAHealth08.pdf?MOD=AJPERES](https://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/85950800457e1fda87c5d7519b2d33fa/SnakebiteSpiderbiteGuidelinesSA-SAHealth08.pdf?MOD=AJPERES)\n\nEdit4: bringing attention to comment from u/rex_cc7567  \\- thanks mate.  \n*Antivenom is not universal. Some are Polyvalent and can treat an array of species, but there is no universal antivenom for now according to Australian's NHMRC* [*https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/resources/impact-case-studies/australian-antivenom-saving-lives-case-study#:\\~:text=However%2C%20due%20to%20variability%20among,currently%20no%20universal%20snake%20antivenom*](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/resources/impact-case-studies/australian-antivenom-saving-lives-case-study#:~:text=However%2C%20due%20to%20variability%20among,currently%20no%20universal%20snake%20antivenom)*.*\n\n*Nonetheless, don't try to catch a snake is obviously a good advice.*  \n\n\n*\\^* I agree with rex in that I'd trust the govt info over the polyvalent company's info. However, the parasuniversal document referenced is speaking only in the context of Australia while ironically the Australian govt document is written with international context. \n\n**The myth to bust remains the same** \\- don't suck the wound or clean it or remove clothing or try to catch the snake.",

There are three basic types of snake jaws. Two types have front fangs, they'll make the two holes you're used to seeing with vampire bites and snake bites. The third is for Colubridae and Homalopsidae snakes, they're also called rear-fanged. People think they aren't venomous cus of asinine advice like the one I listed, but it's not total bullshit. A lot of rear-fanged snakes have less potent or harmful venom, but not all. The boomslang is the most venomous snake on earth and it is a rear-fanged snake.\n\nActually, anything having to do with snakes. Check any 'cool fact guide' about snakes and 9 times out of then they're gonna have misinformation. Head shape has more to do with what they eat and their jaw type than whether they're venomous or not. Eyes? That has to do with what time of day they're active. Black and Yellow kill a fellow, red and black friend of jack? Doesn't always apply depending on the morph of the coral snake.

In the average scenario near most stores you've picked a dumpster full of broken merchandise that has bits of metal, ceramic, wood, and glass.

It takes less battery life, you're more likely to remember how to do it easily, it's more likely to go through in cases of bad reception because it takes less signal and it will auto retry a few times.  And people are more likely to see it in a quicker time frame.  \n\n\nAnd, I don't think there's advice on this, but since it's a thing that happened it probably is worth saying.  If you're lost, or if you're out longer than you anticipated and people might think you're lost or otherwise in danger, answer your phone even if you don't recognize the number.  It could be emergency services or search and rescue and if you don't respond they'll have to waste resources trying to find you.

Animal body language can help gauge a situation before taking that approach. For example, in Australia with most animals the rule of thumb is to mind your business. Give animals personal space, respect. If you're closer than comfort to them, being loud and making sudden movements in close quarters will often stress an animal out causing it to either flee or feel provoked and fight. Most animals either run/slither away, very occasionally come closer for a curious sniff, or just keep doing their own thing without your interference. Even snakes prefer to flee over fight. That said, some animals get up in the business you're minding either unintentionally or out of curiosity (unless it's an aggressive kangaroo/large bird or a croc in which case good luck and get outta there).

            "text": "Going along with the advice about not opening your windows during a tornado, I have a few more bits of tornado safety advice;\n\n1) For the love of god or the FSM, DO NOT take shelter under a highway overpass! The reason for this is that flying debris become dangerous missiles in the tornado airflow, which can already cause winds in excess of 200 mp/h or 320 km/h for the metric oriented folks, and easily with enough force to embed a hunk of wood like a telephone poll into concrete. The higher up on an embankment you go, the higher the air pressure and wind speed, and the faster and deadlier the debris (anything from dirt and sand to pieces of metal, glass, rocks, or sharp wood splinters.) There's generally a lack of handrails or girders for you to grab onto, and even if you did, you aren't strong enough to hold on to them given the high winds that can hit in excess of the speeds listed above... And which, under an overpass, can be inverted at 180 degrees, thus buffeting you from different directions.\n\n2) If you're caught out in the open and about to get hit by a tornado, ditch the ditch. While true that they do offer (marginally) more protection than being out in the open, there are some key drawbacks to seeking shelter in one; they flood, they really don't stop any of the debris or high winds at all (a tornado will throw stuff where and how it wants), loose and active power lines can be all over the place (and will conduct with all that floodwater mentioned), and at least one person is known to have suffered severe injury from a venomous snake bite when he jumped into a ditch for cover.\n\n3) Abandon the idea that tornadoes come from and move in only one direction - this is sorta dead, but the myth goes that a tornado only comes from one direction, moving in a linear path. The myth also used to stipulate the actual ordinal direction (SW to NE). In theory, this meant that people could take shelter at a corner of their home that was best suited to survive relative to wind direction. This \"advice\" has gotten dozens of people killed over the years. Similar to the winds listed for overpasses and how they shift directions, the same idea rings the true. And storms may generally follow a broad direction overall, for smaller cells like tornado-spawning supercells, this is not true, and storms can and do change directions on a dime.\n\n4) Don't try to outrun a tornado in your car or vehicle if you're caught out in it and it's closer than about 2-3 miles from you. The storm has a lot more wind behind it than your car, and it isn't constrained to roads. It moves as the crow flies, whereas even a 4wd vehicle can get stuck in a field, or behind a fence, or in a thicket of trees or vegetation it can't cross. And you may be fighting buffeting crosswinds and outflow from the storm while you're driving, which can kick up smaller debris and slow you down since wind is pushing against your vehicle. The tornado does not have that problem whatsoever. It is the storm, and its groundspeed is utterly unaffected by any terrestrial obstacle (and has probably already turned said obstacle into a missile.) Remember, the winds are strong enough to launch pieces of debris with enough force to penetrate and perforate solid concrete.\n\n5) Seek a purpose built, underground tornado shelter. If you live in an area prone to tornadoes, consider investing in one. They are designed to be impervious to even the mightiest tornadoes, being well over a meter or two underground, and are designed so that flooding is not a concern. If one is not available seek shelter in a cellar or basement, and underneath a solid structure like a table or desk. If neither of these are available, seek shelter in the centermost room of your home without any windows and on the first floor. As with tornado shelters consider investing in a storm room. These are above ground, but are generally designed to withstand even a powerful tornado. \n\nStay safe out there, storm chasers!",

If you get tired then float on your back.\n\n* signal for help by raising a hand, waving etc. Your voice is unlikely to carry far enough on a noisy beach.\n\n* if no help is available, wait for the rip to spit you out past the breaking waves, then try and swim in at an angle (not back the way you came from). Usually rip currents will only take you that far and no further unless you're next to a headland or structure. As you swim in keep glancing back at what the waves are doing. Use the white water / broken waves to help push you into shore. If a big wave is breaking on your head dive under it. \n\n* Often there will be a cross-current running along the beach as well, especially in rough conditions. Pay attention to which way you're being dragged and choose your approach so that you're not fighting that current either.\n\nA lot of the time you can probably get away with just floating and not doing anything. A coastal engineering professor of mine showed us a video where he and some other researchers went into a rip wearing life jackets and just floated with the current. They drifted out and then back in to shore further down the beach. Of course, every beach is different and there is no advice that will be universally applicable. The critical thing is to keep calm, conserve energy and ideally not get stuck in the first place. Listen to lifeguards, know your limits, swim at patrolled beaches.",

This much is true.\n\nHowever, it's more accurate to say wool is warmer to wear, but it isn't warm itself. Like a sleeping bag, our bodies are what makes it warm. A sleeping bag without a warm body to insulate will be just as cold as the surrounding air. Wool does have a saturation point as well. It can only wick so much. If you're caught in a rainstorm, and are getting soaked, it doesn't take much time or wind to kick off hypothermia. \n\nWool is wonderful, but it is not magical. I wear it year round working in forestry, camping, hiking, and hunting in the Rocky Mountains. But wool alone won't save you. Bring a spare baselayer that stays dry, bring appropriate rain gear, and get to cover if the storm is too much.\n\n A lightweight 100 sq ft tarp can be the size of a 1 liter Nalgene bottle, costing less than $40, and weighs just under two pounds. Perfectly reasonable to carry for a day hike, and a guaranteed shelter. Your wool, or any clothes, will be much better at keeping you warm underneath the tarp which keeps you dry. There's nothing brave about hiking through a rainstorm. Plan ahead for weather and if caught out, get to shelter. Don't rely on your clothes to save you, use your brain.",

I can’t say there aren’t any glasses that work like that, but, as someone who wears glasses and knows people who wear glasses, I can say that mine can’t be used to focus sunlight into a point to make a fire (like a magnifying glass).\n\nWhat else… hmm… don’t rub frostbitten skin (slowly rewarm the tissue without rubbing instead), alcohol doesn’t help with getting warm (it actually cools you off faster even if you feel warm inside), not all layers are equal (cotton’s really bad for cold weather.  Wool, conversely, is actually okay in heat so long as it’s a breathable outfit), raw meat and (most) seafood is not safe to eat (sushi is only made from specific saltwater animals for that reason), moss doesn’t actually grow only on the North side of trees, don’t build a fire in a cave (heat makes rocks expand, which can lead to breakage.  Also smoke in enclosed spaces is a bad idea), the fingernail test for wood isn’t reliable, wet matches won’t work even if you dry them out, and, finally, don’t drink urine, blood, or snow to stay hydrated (eating snow is large quantities can cause hypothermia).\n\nPhew!

It gives people a poor sense of confidence. Just having a gas mask is not enough. There is a lot of other information required. Seeing people walk into clouds of gas/smoke during some of the riots because they had masks on was dumb. You need to know what the chemical is and if your filter is appropriate for it. Acid vapors require a special layer to help neutralize it, chlorine needs to be a particularly large filter because it will saturate all of the carbon quickly. You also need to have an understanding of the concentration. Just because the filter is able to filter out the bad stuff- it is not able to produce oxygen. If there's enough of something else it will displace oxygen and now you are going to have a bad day as your brain fogs up and your body shuts down due to a lack of oxygen. \n\nA real gas mask is not something you can improvise and needs to be stored and maintained and then you have to seek knowledge and training",

This avoids the risk of an evacuation. \n\nSo everyone (at least initially) stayed in place as instructed. \n\nExcept in “renovating” the building to look more attractive from the outside, non-fireproof cladding was used.

Even shows by people who know what they’re doing are techniques you’ll never use because the situations are so extreme. Also, people miss the point of a lot of them: They get you through the moment, staying alive in the hopes of being rescued, even if you could end up in the hospital afterwards. Depending on the situation you may have to do things that will be bad for you long term, but they will give you the chance to actually HAVE a “long term”. It’s like treating a really bad wound when you don’t have sterile gear: Yes, you’ll probably get an infection and it could kill you in a couple of days, but if you DON’T treat it you will be dead in a couple of hours. The point of any survival training is staying alive until you’re rescued or find help, not so you can live off the land indefinitely. That’s a whole different set of skills (even if some overlap).",

You are not a trained EMT or health professional, you can't differentiate between your or their pulse, you can't differentiate between agonal breathing and normal breathing. It will be a stressful situation to put it mildly. In the best case scenario, there will be no blood or other fluids, but even so, you are not trained nor mentally equipped to think logically in this scenario. \n\nWhen you see someone lying on the ground without signs of moving, you first try to use your voice from a distance to see if they respond. If don't, get closer to them and repeat the question. No response? Rub your knuckles on their sternum forcefully. If that doesn't provoke a response, immediately call 911 and start chest compression. Don't stop for trying to breathe into their mouth, just keep chest compressing in rhythmic tempo until professional help arrives. If possible, make sure to find at least one person to help you, either call 911 or with chest compression. It's VERY tiring, and you can't go more than a few minutes until your body just says no. If you can't find anyone, and you really can't continue. Stop, take a short rest and continue. How long to rest? That depends entirely on you. No one will blame you if you simply won't be able to physically compress chest any more, alone. That's a feat worthy of Greek gods. The oxygenated blood you pumped into their brain should give you enough time to rest 1/2 (two minutes CPR one minutes rest) (brain damage within 2-4 minutes is very rare, so are still well within the optimal range). After 5-6 minutes, you have to introduce at least some form of breath, be it only two per minute. You can go without, but the CPR will be less and less effective, until it's not effective at all, especially as the fatigue kicks in.  Bad chests compressions would only tire you and wouldn't help the victim, but if you can hear the sirens, push through the pain and exhaustion, until you see the vehicle. Then you can finally rest. \n\nDon't worry about liability. Stopping CPR due to fatigue is protected under the Good Samaritan law in every US state.\n\nDo you feel exhausted and stressed just reading this? Welcome to boot camp, real situation will be stressful and exhausting tenfold. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/j9pfz5/this_is_what_an_hour_of_performing_cpr_looks_like/\n\nHere's a story about a professional EMT doing CPR for an hour with 3 other EMT. They needed to switch every 2 or 3 sets (4-6 minutes). Imagine you are supposed to pump alone. That's simply impossible and not your fault if you can't do it. \n\nThe same goes for tourniquet. If you get to the point, when you are deciding to use tourniquet or not, ALWAYS use tourniquet. You don't know what type of damage the victim sustained, how complicated it is, how it can get worse, you just happen to be in a situation when someone is bleeding, and you have access to a tourniquet. USE IT! Apply it as close to the heart as possible. Someone is heavily bleeding near an ankle? Tourniquet upper thigh.\n\nRemember, you will not be in control of your emotions. Your memory will be severely restricted, and you will PANIC! Don't try to do things by a book, do them by Instinct. If instinct tells you, \"this person is not breathing\" do the chest rub and go Straith to CPR, don't even bother to talk to them. The earlier you start chest compression the better survival rates they have, but remember, when get to the point of needing chest compression, your survival rate is about 8-10%.",

Call 911 immediately or go to your nearest hospital. \n\nDNA is a powerful thing. If they left DNA anywhere on your person, there's a good chance the criminal can be found. And if we don't get a hit in our data base, depending on the type of DNA found, we can use the DNA to build an image of what the criminal probably looks like by extracting information from the DNA. We don't usually have to go that far, but the last one we did was actually pretty close to what the person actually looked like, and he was caught shortly after the image was released.\n\n Science is a beautiful thing. \n\nFrom a crime scene standpoint, if it happens in your home/living quarters, do not try and move anything or clean up anything in the space in which your think the crime occurred. It'll just make it more difficult for the crime scene specialist to piece together what happened and more difficult to find evidence (ex, they could have left a hair behind on the bed, but you made the bed and accidentally brushed the hair to the floor, never to be seen again). \n\nOf course, this only applies if you feel you want justice or closure. I understand some people want to literally just want to try and forget and that's your decision to make. Just remember, without any DNA, clear description of the person, or evidence, it makes it nearly impossible to catch someone, so you need to report as soon as possible if you're going to do so, as hard as that might be to do. \n\nRemember, rape is never the victim's fault.

When my hubby and I go on wilderness trips, we also tell our family where we are going in to the woods from. \n\nExample: “We are going to be in the XYZ Wilderness area. We are taking Highway 103 to County Rd 25 and then taking the Grant Forest Road west toward the start of the Bear Creek Trail.” Now if we go missing, searchers know where we went into the wilderness and where to start looking for us. Even better if you send someone a picture of a map of the area with your planned camp marked on it.\n\nMake sure someone not with you knows your plans and knows to call authorities if you are not heard from by a certain date or time. \n\nIf you go to a park or wilderness area with a place to sign in, sign in! That lets people searching for you know that you were there and when. It gives a place to start the search from. \n\nIf you get lost, stay put. Focus on shelter and staying hydrated. Once you have a shelter, do what you can to make your location more visible from the air. Building a fire helps- the smoke will attract the attention of rescuers. Plus, it gives you a way to stay warm and cook something to eat/boil water for drinking. \n\nCarry things like dry soup mix and a small aluminum pot in your pack.

But you can see it’s not crushed them enough to cause inevitable death regardless of actions taken. NEVER remove said object that’s pinning the patient to the wall. There’s two reasons for this: \n\n1. The object is almost certainly stopping the patient from bleeding out thanks to the blood furiously clotting around the object (and let’s face it - you’re not going to be able to apply the same amount of pressure to the wounds to stem the bleeding than the object is. \n\n2. Crush-induced rhabdomyolysis. Once muscle and tissue injury are sustained, a cascade of events results in spilling of intracellular contents.\nThe crushing force causes direct mechanical injury to the muscle cell sarcolemma, leading to sodium and calcium release, continued enzymatic cellular destruction, and an influx of water.\n\nThe influx of water results in intravascular volume depletion, leading to hypotension.2 With the continued entrapment of the patient’s limb, hypoperfusion worsens, contributing to tissue hypoxia.\nThis hypoxia forces metabolism down the anaerobic pathway, resulting in increased lactic acid formation. Additional toxin release from the limb will remain localized at the site of trauma, as venous return proximal to the injury site is impeded.\n\nOnce the cause of crush injury and pressure is relieved, all toxins from the damaged tissue cellular components will be released systemically. This systemic release can ultimately be fatal, which should prompt extreme caution and early care when managing a patient with a potential crush injury.\n\nSource: Saint John Ambulance Member",

There are no alligators that are going to chase someone on land, that's not how they hunt and you're most likely to big for them anyway. The whole \"run zig zag\" is irrelevant. Black bears are massive cowards. You can be by yourself and come across a black bear and if you yell at it it'll take off running. Even if you don't yell, it'll most likely run anyway. If it doesn't, yell. Whatever you do though, don't run. That just makes you seem like prey. If you're backcountry camping, don't keep anything smellable in your tent. That includes food, toothpaste deodarant, or even bugspray. Black bears will check that stuff out. Cougars on the other hand are much more dangerous. If you see a cougar, most likely its already seen you. Stand your ground, dont run. If it charges anyway, protect your head and neck. This is all mostly nullified by not being alone, but some people like to hike alone. Whatever you do though, never hike alone at night where cougars are. \n\nThis is for people from the states, I know nothing on crocodiles or other big cats.",

Simply stay put, and keep your hands in your armpits to stay warm and wiggle your toes as much as possible to keep blood flow moving to your extremities. \n\nAlso pro tip from a search and rescue retiree: if you live and travel in place that get lots of snow in the winter like Canada and the northern US, always pack mittens/gloves, extra socks, and a blanket or foot/hand warmers in your car. If the situation ever does occur where you’re trapped in your car in the snow, these things can be the difference between life and freezing to death.

This will cause a major geiser like effect and probably burn you. \n\nThe way it works is that the coolant heats up and expands a little bit, that is normal. Due to the expansion, the pressure in the coolant system rises. And liquid that is pressurized will boil at a higher temperature. Coolant tank caps also have a pressure rating as well. \nSo what actually happens when the engine is overheated.\nThe coolant temp is very high and the pressure in the cooling system is therefore at a maximum. This pressure has increased the boiling temperature of the coolant. When you take the cap off. The pressure suddenly drops and so does the boiling temp of the liquid,  this causes the coolant to immediatly go into transformation from liquid to boiling/streaming and thus expand rapidly. This can happen so fast the cap might become a projectile shooting away, followed by really hot coolant and coolant stream and that is really dangerous. I've actually seen people get hurt badly. \n\nJust let the engine cool off on it's own is my advice.",

If you can boil it, do of course (3 minutes rolling boil to be safe), but if you can’t get a fire, don’t have a lifestraw, and don’t have iodine tablets, it can take up to a week to get any symptoms of giardia or cryptosporidium. It’s better to get the extra seven days and get the chance to be treated for the viruses or bacteria than to die after 3 days of dehydration. \n\nNot every stream has giardia in it, but even if it does the extra time alive to get rescued is better than dying of dehydration worrying about it.

If they are too weak to hold on to the stern, hold onto them and wait for help. \r  \nWorst comes to absolute worst, you have to enter the water. If you aren't trained, find someone who is.

Posts like this get your attention, get liked by people who don't know better, are shared by folks trying to be helpful, and the algorithm spreads it like wildfire.  \n  \nTLDR: Make the call to 911, or send a text.  \n\n1. Without a signal (connection to the cell system) YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR VOICEMAIL. The voicemail system resides with your cell provider. To change your outgoing message, you have to CALL into your voicemail and then navigate the menus, record a new greeting, confirm the new greeting, etc. YOU CANNOT DO THIS WITH NO SIGNAL.  \n2. If your battery is low do not waste its power by calling your voice mail—or a friend or relative. Call 9-1-1 for help.  \n3. If you have no signal, text for help to 9-1-1. Many, if not most, 9-1-1 centers can receive a text.  \n4. Text takes much less power, is far more likely to get through, will automatically retry many times if you have spotty service, leaves record others can see and can give you an indication that it got thru.  BTW, because of the automatic retries, you can compose and hit send on a text and then get your phone as high as possible to improve the chances of getting the message out.  \n5. Stay put. Okay, if you're lost or broken down and you've called for help (assuming you have signal and battery) please stay in one location—UNLESS YOU MUST MOVE FOR SAFETY REASONS.  Changing your location makes our job more difficult. Trying to reach someone whose GPS location we have (within a circle, of course) is faster for us than trying to nail down a moving target. STAY PUT.  \n6. Maximize battery life.  In order to make the battery last longer, turn off everything you do not need.  Close all apps. Turn off WiFi and Bluetooth.  Don't use your cell phone as a GPS/map device and especially do not use the compass if your phone has one -- the compass feature in some phones is a serious battery drain.  Pull out your map and compass and/or use a dedicated GPS unit. You may be instructed, by text, to turn your phone off and text back at a specific time.  Also, keep your phone just a little warm with some body heat or a handwarmer.",

Drowning is defined as a respiratory impairment — that is, being unable to breathe — as a result of being submerged in water. When a person is struggling underwater and unable to come up for air, they experience a reflex called a laryngeal spasm. This spasm shuts off the airways and stops oxygen flowing to the brain. Without CPR, it can lead to a loss of consciousness (and worse).\n\nWater that does enter the lungs my irritate the lungs, and cause swelling, or worse, be polluted with germs and chemicals causing more severe reactions and infection,  soon after, or more insidiously.  \n\nBut “washing away the surfactants of the lungs” and causing them to collapse is Wayyyyyy out there.  \n\nAfter an actual “drowing” of course you should see a medical profesional.  And in any case of serious submersion or loss of consciousness. \n\nLook for immediate or delayed \n\nChange of skin color.\nHeavy coughing.\nHigh fever.\nLoss of consciousness.\nShortness of breath or trouble breathing.\nVomiting and flu like symptoms\n\nAs clues an ER visit after an “incident” might be needed. \n\nThere are no medically accepted conditions known as \"near-drowning,\" \"dry drowning\" and \"secondary drowning.\" Rather, the terms refer to delayed illness that is caused by aspiration of water into the lungs, which may cause the vocal cords to spasm and the airway to close up. This acute lung injury can develop over minutes to hours after exposure, though, despite news reports, it is quite rare.\n\n“There are two primary causes for drowning, which occurs when you can't get oxygen into your lungs because you are in or below water.\n\nThe first occurs when someone is under water for too long and the body begins to experience reflexes of panic, agitation and air hunger. When you can't avoid taking a breath underwater, fluid will rush into the lungs. This is what occurs in about half of all drowning cases.\n\nThe other type of drowning occurs when the voice box closes off. Known as a laryngospasm, it is a reflex that happens to prevent fluid from getting into the lungs. This could happen if you are below water and holding your breath to the point where you pass out.\n\nWhen any degree of water inadvertently goes “down the wrong pipe” and into the airway ― whether from swimming or drinking a glass of water ― cough is the body’s natural defense mechanism to try to remove fluid. In many cases, when there is a small amount of water aspirated into the lungs, coughing will clear it.\n\nIn the event that a lot of water gets into the lungs and is not expelled, it can irritate the lining of the lungs and cause fluid buildup ― a condition called pulmonary edema. You'd likely notice your child having trouble breathing right away or it might worsen over time.\n\nSmall children may have difficulty communicating if they are experiencing trouble breathing so it is important to be familiar with symptoms of respiratory dysfunction, such as prolonged cough, unusually rapid breathing or change in mental status — whether 30 minutes after you've been in the water or a week.”\n\nhttps://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-what-is-dry-drowning/",
