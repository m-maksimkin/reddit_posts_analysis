He ended up blindsiding me by cheating on me and then breaking up with me on the trip. We cut our trip early and booked separate flights home. \n\nOn my flight I was upset and couldn‚Äôt stop crying. Crying on a plane is pretty embarrassing but also I looked absolutely crazy. \n\nI took a picture and uploaded it to my private Instagram with a goofy caption. Looking back it‚Äôs a hilarious picture and posting it was well worth it. A bunch of my friends got a good laugh out of it.",

So I made a quick tiktok and posted it. It was my most watched video of the week. \n\nSo by making a video of me crying, not only was I getting the cathartic release of actually crying. I also got a nice hit of dopamine with every veiw and like. And unexpectedly, a lot of people reached out cause it resonated with them, so i also got to feel like part of a community. \n\nI'm not saying I would do it all the time.

            "text": "There was an article the other day that I read on this, but I can't seem to find it! The idea behind the article was that crying on camera is an act of resistance through radical vulnerability. \n\nTW:neglect\n\n\nTL;DR: I used to push down my crying and emotions and it lead to long term mental health crisis. I tired to push down my needs, and ended up hating myself. Through radical vulnerability (opening up to peers and expressing \"negative\" emotions) I have learned that a lot of what I struggled with as a kid and was told to ignore, or hide, are things that a lot of other people struggle with too. My needs are important, and now that I am making sure those needs are satisfied (food, meds, therapy, sleep, all things I didn't take seriously in my 20s), and i am no contact with my family, I am doing a lot better than I was and I'm making progress in therapy. Sharing crying pictures is the best logical step in my radical vulnerability journey. \n\nI haven't posted it yet, but I took a picture of me crying the other day for the first time with the intent of posting it on social media. \n\n\nWe afab humans are conditioned often(but also amab!!) that crying is bad. If someone is crying, they're sad and it's bad that they are sad. You're over reacting, this problem isn't that big, you shouldn't still be sad that was yesterday. I was tasked with \"fixing the problem\" so to speak, the problem of me crying. I was expected to constantly monitor my parents mood so I didn't trigger their anger. If they were yelling on the phone and I got hurt or upset, and I tried to ask for help, I would get screamed at by mother to \"read my face\"(her face) and eventually I just started taking care of myself the best I could, starting at around 6 years old when my brother was born. I was tasked with caring and babysitting when my parents were at work or asleep. I remember changing his diaper because parents would get up for his cries. They didn't help me work through any of my emotional break downs that started in elementary school. They didn't comfort me emotionally past saying a platitude then get aggrivated that I was still upset. I'd get upset and cry all the time but I'd get \"ahold of myself\" and push it back down. This maladaptive coping technique lead to a lot of self hate. I was wildly suicidal for about 15 years (stable now!! In an intensive trauma informed therapy)l program) and hid every time I cried. Later in life, I started sobbing I started punching myself to get myself \"under control.\n\nI learned about a year ago that crying episodes have a natural conclusion. That if you let yourself cry, and maybe talk to someone, it helps regulate your stress hormones and I feel so much better after. My whole life, I thought that if I couldn't stop myself from crying (often during full breakdowns) I'd never stop and they'd have to admit me to a psych ward to get treatment. That it was unacceptable to cry around anyone except the psych ward staff. \n\nThat's all to say that, I think that for me posting crying pictures is a form of resistance to the assumed standard that crying is bad. Crying is natural and people should have empathy if they see it. It's a way of saying \"I'm allowed to have '' negative feelings\" and it's okay for me to be open and vulnerable about it with other humans.\" Some people are dismissive or rude, but the vast majority of the time people can relate to my anxieties and fears. Opening up and letting myself talk about my anxieties and cry infront of others who listen to me, believe me, and value my wellbeing. The next logical step would be to be vulnerable with a larger audience of people, kind of like exposure therapy. One way of doing this is by sharing pictures of you crying, expressing that emotion in a way that let's you connect to other humans that can relate to you.\n\nIf people react badly to it then I know they're not someone I want to be close with anyway. \n\nThis turned into a novel, but I hope it provides some insight into how sharing crying selfies is a way of taking back your own power by practicing radical vulnerability.",

However, the other day I was listening to music on YouTube made by someone in her room, and one song started with her crying while some text explained how lonely and depressed she was when writing the song.\n\nIt stopped me in my tracks. People crying make me very uncomfortable. Maybe it's because I'd get the \"I'll give you a reason to cry\" followed by a smack to the face for crying when I was a kid. Maybe it's because men aren't supposed to cry. I'm sure there are a lot of reasons why crying makes me so uncomfortable. \n\nSo back to the question. I've never seen someone cry on my social feeds, but I hope it wouldn't make me as angry as all the commenters here seem to get. I'd hope it'd make me stop in my tracks again and feel empathy for the person. Just take a moment to realize how hard life can be. Have you ever watched the Pixar movie Inside Out? Remember, the point of the Sadness character was to alert people in the girl's life that she needed support or comforting. Maybe these crying videos are just a modern take on someone reaching out for support or comforting?\n\nAlso, if it's ok to post videos of yourself laughing or smiling, shouldn't it be the same for crying? Crying isn't a bad thing, so why is everyone acting like it is? I imagine in a healthier society people could express a fuller range of emotions without any stigma.",

Example: a friend of my husband? who‚Äôs father had passed a year earlier, posted a video talking about his grief that day. He opened with, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to cry during this and that‚Äôs ok. There are going to be people in my comments who are going to say this is pussy-shit and I don‚Äôt care. Men need to be allowed to feel what they are feeling.‚Äù He then went on to say wonderful things about his memories with his dad and shed many tears along the way. He ended with a message encouraging people to show love at any and every opportunity you can. If you love someone- tell them, show them, do anything you can to be present with them. And allow yourself the space to miss them when they are gone. \n\nAfterwards, he was able to have several conversations with fellow men in person who were also struggling with grief and they were healing conversations. Vulnerability begets vulnerability. A video is very public, and should be carefully weighed, but it also reaches a wide audience without making you repeat yourself on a painful topic and invites conversations from interested parties rather than forcing people into the uncomfortable place of feeling like an asshole if they are not prepared to be in a heavy conversation. You can click off a video, you can‚Äôt as easily do that in person. \n\nIt‚Äôs a strange world where we criticize people for posting exclusively good things in their lives bc that paints an unrealistic picture or is attention seeking ‚Ä¶ but then turn around and criticize them for posting feelings that are more raw and also exclusively call it bad attention seeking. A lot of what we do online and offline can work to seek attention, but that doesn‚Äôt make those things bad. Example: If you are injured and you seek the attention of a doctor- this is a good thing. If you are perfectly healthy and inventing illnesses for the attention of a doctor‚Ä¶ this is obviously not good. \n\nIntention and follow up matters for everything we put out there.",

The proliferation of phones and recording devices has made it easier to document everything.

One that comes to mind is miscarriages.  It‚Äôs something that typical hasnt been talked about openly.  Parents often have to keep that in and face mental health and emotional issues alone.  It can also be educational to document authentic emotional experiences.  I‚Äôd be willing to bet there are other positive reasons for doing it.

I saw somewhere, honestly I think it was Reddit, that pity posting simply never accomplishes what you want it to. I thought about it for a little bit and realized that yeah, it doesn‚Äôt look good from the outside looking in. Maybe you‚Äôre looking for sympathy, but you‚Äôre not gonna get it with Snapchat pity posting. Maybe looking for attention, but you‚Äôre not gonna get the attention you want. It honestly just makes you think about whatever you‚Äôre sad about even more, and makes it worse when you realize nobody actually gives a shit.",

It's easier than typing out a long message and I realized that it helps me specifically when I'm needing a good vent session. For me, talking my feelings out is more relieving than texting/writing them out. Also, it feels good to have someone being on the receiving end; someone who will just listen.\n\nMy theory on people crying on social media ties in with that. I think people do it because it feels better to cry their frustrations out to *someone else* rather than just to themselves. You can vent, share and know people will listen, and some people may even reach out and offer support.",

It's obviously not a healthy way to do so, but it can be difficult talking to friends and family about depression, and trying to do so can push people away; I have personal experience with this, during the peak of depression before I sought treatment, I would reach out to friends and try to treat them like a therapist, which would alienate them because they aren't equipped to deal with that. Reaching out on social media may be their way of doing the same, looking for someone who can help them.\n\nNow, the other side of this is just people seeking attention, thinking that fake-crying (or even real-crying) is going to garner views and comments and interaction. There's *some* shitty-ness to this, but honestly I'd still view this as some sort of mental illness, even if it's not exactly depression.",

When people kill themselves others are sometimes surprised because they never showed any sign. I'm not saying all these people are suicidal but you don't have to be that down to reach out. Yes, it's a form of attention seeking, but if it prevents you from getting worse or doing stupid things, it's worth it.\n\n2) Part of the reason I used to whine on Facebook was for others who felt like me.

I know for a fact she is not, as I have been to countless drs appts with her. The general public does not understand \"Invisible Illness\" and thinks that since \"she looks fine, she must be fine\". And that backwards thinking really effects her to the point that she sometimes will question her own sanity. So I truly believe she does it to prove to everyone that she is legitimately sick & in pain. And lonely. Just Bc she is gorgeous doesn't mean that she does not suffer daily & that she isn't isolated.

Started a very strong cocktail of chemo drugs (BEP) to combat the cancer as the tumor was growing quickly and since I knew I was going to lose my hair, I had some fun with it and dyed it silver because it gave me a feeling of control in a situation where I had none.\n\nI was admitted to the hospital for a week to start my chemo treatment. The day after I was discharged, I had a lung infection and had to live in the hospital for another week while they figured it out. \n\n12 days after I started chemo I started losing my hair. While I was mentally ready for it to happen, I wasn't prepared emotionally. I got in the shower and my hair just started coming out in chunks. No matter how much I showered, it just kept falling out and it made me feel so dirty and defeated that I didn't have control over my body. \n\nCame out of the shower and just completely lost it because it hit me that I was truly sick with cancer, my dad gave me a hug and I took a picture of myself to remind me of the raw emotion I felt because I'm normally a positive person.  It was a tough time that I shared on my blog so others could better understand what I was going through emotionally.\n\nHere's the pic if anyone's interested\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qifp8qD.jpg\n\nVideo of how easy chemo hair comes out: https://youtu.be/le2CJRRQQYg",

Generally, people post their best selves on social media, even so far as to *fictionalize* that aspect of their lives to appear more than they are. They show themselves enjoying things and being generally happy with their lives. It gives people false impressions of them and, in the worst cases, causes the observer to compare their lives, including the ugly parts of them, to what they see of the influencer which, again, is *only* the good. The counter to that is to show the darker parts of one's life. The depression, the anxiety, the *real* struggles that any normal human being goes through in today's society. It gives a more complete picture of what a normal human experience is on this planet instead of just seeing the lives of others through rose-tinted glasses.",

            "text": "While not a direct answer, I'll try and shed some light on this. I'm a 34 year old man. Probably not the demographic expected when asking this particular question, but I would imagine the desire and thought process are the same, regardless of who it's coming from.\n\n2 years ago, I went through the worst breakup I'd ever had (up to that point) and I was lost, alone, confused, and depressed (I got diagnosed, and started treatment thanks to this situation). I couldn't eat or sleep, and I lost 80 pounds in 6 months. I felt like my friends and community support system didn't understand what I was going through. If you're familiar with how community works in churches with a high percentage of college graduates and young professionals, these people tend to get married right after graduation, or within a few years, to someone who they've dated for only a short time. It's bonkers. Those people then turn into 30-somethings that have been married for 8-10 years already and have no idea what it's like to be in the position that I found myself in. Because of that experiential disconnect, I started to reach out to social media. I've always been a little more tech savvy than my peers, and my friend groups online typically tend to skew younger than myself (not by a lot, maybe 5 or 6 years).\n\nEnter Instagram. Now, I have a degree in Digital Media with an emphasis on Film, so I've always found myself more \"artistic\" and \"experimental\" with my posting there, especially using the \"Stories\" functionality. They were perfect. I could post whatever I wanted and in 24 hours it would be gone. After the breakup, it got WAY more nihilistic and explicitly depressing. I still added music to my posts, but now it was either super-duper-depressing ([Fuck Yea, Right Away Great Captain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6w3hJsXxjw)) or super nihilistic (just like a bunch of Vaporwave). I did eventually progress to posting captioned stories describing the depressing coping mechanisms I was utilizing at the time, but sarcastically. Think Instragram story of going on a 10-mile run at midnight in February and captioning it \"PRO-TIP: Always run at night so people think your eyes are watering from the cold and not because you're crying. üòé\" or one where I posted from the top of a bridge saying \"I'm pretty sure if I hit right, I could break my neck on the bank and be unable to save myself from drowning.\" I did post a couple self portrait shots of me looking haggard, tired, and sometimes bloodied (I ran on some rough trails, and fell frequently). \n\nHere's what I found: People started to watch me. My number of viewers went way up, and that was a tangible, measurable change that was...kind of addicting. I was most likely a spectacle and it wasn't people concerned about my well-being, but it just felt good to be seen. I kept that up for a while, at least until the anti-depressants started kicking in.\n\nIn summation, here's what I think I was getting out of it:\n\n1. Engagement - I felt like people were paying attention to me (which is what a lot of other people are saying here). Sometimes people would reply and tell me they were praying for me, which did kind of help. I would say ultimately it WAS a cry for help.\n\n2. Understanding - Reaching beyond my immediate community for someone who knew what I was going through. Sometimes I got that, sometimes I didn't.\n\n3. Expression - It was a way to vent about everything that was going on and express the frustration, anger, and depression that I felt.\n\n4. Killing time - Honestly, I did it just to take up time. I lost a very large time commitment in my life, and I had nothing to fill it up with.\n\nAnyway, that's my rant. Sorry if it wasn't what you were expecting. I swear it's all true up to this point. I'm just glad that social media wasn't around when I was growing up. I can't imagine what I would have posted in 1998 when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.",

Around this time (2017) there weren‚Äôt too many ‚Äúsobriety influencers‚Äù for lack of a better term. I ended up becoming a little one. I recorded a lot of content telling what the process is like and a lot of it evoked emotion. I wouldn‚Äôt be crying when the videos started but sometimes it would end with me choking up. \n\nI had probably over 500 people message me over a year span telling me I had helped in them redefining their relationship with alcohol. I had around 15 people tell me I had saved their life. i had 4 people (strangers / acquaintances) call or text me during an active suicide attempt because they thought I‚Äôd be the only one who understood.\n\nOnly 1 person took their own life (the following day they got kicked out of their apartment and lost their job, jumped off a bridge) \n\nIt was a really intense year. I‚Äôm 4 years sober and don‚Äôt blog about it now but I‚Äôm really glad I did all of that. Now there‚Äôs tons of sobriety accounts and people can find other outlets.

            "text": "Overall, this is a form of narcissism in the sense that narcissism is about individuals who have low self-worth needing external validation. So a traditional narcissist will tell people how great he/she is, while a non-traditional narcissist will exaggerate how low his/her worth in order to force others to have to tell this person what a great and important human being he/she is. However, I would say that social media conditions people to value external validation more and more because it is so visible and easy to game, so the danger of social media‚Äîoutside of radicalizing people and creating echo chambers‚Äîis slowly turning people more and more narcissistic in ways we don't traditionally recognize as narcissism. \n\nThe main reason is that social media provides a form of validation through likes and impressions, which we‚Äîas social creatures‚Äîinstinctively crave. So incentives are not aligned as to give people meaningful validation by doing something positive for the group/society, and social media instead allows for false validation to be received in a way that's so easily quantified that the number of likes or views overshadows validation through other means. It is also easy to send fake validation, since a \"like\" is a very simple thing to do, so even people who certainly do not receive or acknowledge true value from the interaction still find it within their best interests via a simple cost-benefit analysis that boosting another individual is an easy way to also game his/her own self worth. \n\nSo attention is the ultimate goal, which means the means of attention is irrelevant. And to the extent that someone cannot find internal validation or worth or be able to muster enough talent or effort to do something relatively positive, doing something negative still has the same overall effect.",

Bear in mind that I'm typing this on my phone so excuse any errors and abridgments. \n\nI very rarely take pictures or videos of myself and post them online but I've done it occasionally. And I'll break this answer into two parts. \n\nFirst, for the pictures and videos, I take them for many reasons. I have a very poor recollection of events and that coupled with a strong sense of nostalgia leaves me often not remembering my feelings accurately. I'll think they weren't that sad and whatnot. \"No, this relationship wasn't as traumatic as I thought.\" So, I try to take a photo of myself at that time as a solid reminder of how I felt at the time. Plus, I am very reserved and soft-spoken and so when I am brought to tears, I feel the need to prove my emotions by taking a picture or video. Saying, \"I felt hurt\" isn't enough for people to take my feelings seriously. \n\nSecond, sharing the pictures or videos online is thankfully much easier to explain: I'm alone and desperate. I'm starved for communicatuion, connection, affection-- all of it. There's many reasons for this but it suffices to say that I don't speak to my family, I live across the continent from all my friends, and I'm painfully shy and quiet to that point that my coworkers usually remark that they're not even sure if I'm in the office. I'm living somewhere I've never visited before and I know no one. In my most desperate moments, I've reached out to the suicide hotline just for that relief of connection with a sympathetic human being. But that's not enough. I sometimes need a more sustained connection than a thirty minute conversation; so, I cast my pictures and videos onto the internet for the same reason. No one will likely respond and I might be the subject of ridicule but at least I've reached out. Perhaps I'll even receive pity. But by doing this, I've at least taken a step away from my grief and towards to my relief in connecting with others. \n\nThere's a lot more to be said but that's a short summary.\n\nEdit: Another reason that comes to mind is just the acknowledgement and release of it all. And no, I'm not talking about likes, approval, or comments on the shared pictures or videos. Some people journal just to acknowledge how they felt on a particular day and then release those feelings onto the page after acknowledging them. I suppose there's a similar reasoning behind acknowledging my pain in a picture and then releasing that painful picture into the void of the internet.",

I got tired of trying to reach out to individuals that would never reach back out to me, I was getting to dark places and I didn't know where else to turn. So I started documenting my feelings, going live almost everyday and saving the streams afterwards. I'd cry and laugh, but mostly cry, I'd talk about my suicidal thoughts at the time and why they scared the fuck out of me, talked about issues I was having with my family or school, it was my only escape from my brain. And I lowkey miss it. It let me get my thoughts and feelings out without worrying about being heard because at least I was always listening. Even if no one else ever will. \n\n\nI saved them afterwards because I would always tell myself \"it's going to get better.

I was also self-harming at the time so I wasn‚Äôt in a good place. \n\nAt the time I was posting that type of stuff, I was thinking that maybe somebody would see it and understand what I was going through. I thought the sad ‚Äòartsy‚Äô pictures of me crying would be some kind of profound expression of my pain and somebody, anybody, would see it and then we could connect and maybe I wouldn‚Äôt feel that way anymore. \n\nAround this time I was also a ‚ÄúNice Guy‚Äù and that definitely played a role in a lot of my self-hatred. \n\nLooking back at that time and that shit I posted is sad for me in two different ways: one, I feel shame for it in that ‚Äúcringe‚Äù kind of way, and two, I feel sad because I was just a lost little kid (yeah in my early 20s I was still just a little kid) who was scratching at the world hoping for some kind of connection and/or understanding for what I was feeling. \n\nIn short, I was depressed as fuck and needed help. \n\nI don‚Äôt do that shit anymore and I‚Äôm not a ‚ÄúNice Guy‚Äù anymore. In my mid-to-late 20s I started to get my shit together and my 30s were an awesome decade of maturing and getting help, and now at the start of my 40s things are going quite well and I‚Äôm in a good place.",

I can say part of the reason is that many Gen Z‚Äôs use social media as a diary. We don‚Äôt write things down on paper, we write them on our blogs or snapchats or wherever. I knew someone like that who actually got in some trouble for the shit they posted on their Tumblr‚Äî cyber bullying, joking about hiring a hitman, etc. They didn‚Äôt realize their posts aren‚Äôt just shouting into the void, and that very real people can see them. The thing is, most of the feedback they received from those posts was enabling them. Social media is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than a diary for us‚Äî it‚Äôs a diary that writes back. So when something bad happens and we just need to vent, we document it and put it out into the world because we want that anonymous support in return.\n\nI follow a lot of people on social media who post some pretty personal stuff‚Äî one person venting about their schizophrenia, self-harm, their mom kicking them out of the house, etc. Hell, I‚Äôve vented on my private instagram about being suicidal, body dysmorphia, etc. I‚Äôve recently had to scrub that from my profile for security reasons and it really took me down a dark path of memories. The people who do this are people who are too socially inept to go talk to someone in person about these issues and instead throw them out into the world like a worm on a hook and hope they reel in some support.\n\nUpdate: I‚Äôve remembered something. Sometimes I‚Äôd be having an episode and crying, but I‚Äôll turn it into a meme on snapchat by giving it a funny caption like ‚Äúmom found the poop sock.‚Äù It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm self-aware enough to not just post a video of myself crying, but I‚Äôm still hoping someone will reach out. Kinda like when someone asks ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù and you respond ‚Äúi‚Äôm fine,‚Äù even when you‚Äôre not fine. It‚Äôs also just a way for me to make light of my situation, like yeah i‚Äôm having a crisis but at least we can have a few laughs out of it!

I thought it would literally, bring the cause, more *attention*. \n\nSo yeah, crying online is done for attention, and that‚Äôs not always a bad thing. People talk all the time about looking for the signs that your friends are struggling‚Ä¶ that can be one of them, and not everyone has friends they feel like they can turn to, so they reach out into the void for anyone.\n\nIt can bring attention to a cause.\n\nIt can even signal to other people that it is ok to express emotion publicly (because it fucking is!!) and shaming people (especially impressionable teenagers who do it the most) is reinforcing the idea that showing emotion is a bad thing.

This one kind of pisses me off because it comes off as insincere most of the time and makes me feel like they don't really regret the thing that they did, just that they got negative backlash for it.\n\nOf course there might be other reasons but these 2 are the ones that seem to come out the most",

I didn't so much do recordings since that wasn't a big thing in myspace days lol but I did do a lot of woe is me posts.   \n\n\nBut i had zero people I could go to for help when I needed to express my emotions. My family all thought i was faking crying for attention when they were genuinely abusive and neglectful towards me (Like to a point as a child that it's taken me years as an ADULT to learn social cues and norms because I just had barely any interaction with other people until I got thrown into school, just constantly alone at ages I should not have been). So when it came to being yelled at by my family and being broken down, and dealing with bullying at school, what few friends I did have didn't want to hear about it because we either weren't close enough for them to care or they, like people who view this on social media from the outside, thought I was faking for attention. But really I just had no other outlet for my emotion other than to post it online and hope that maybe someone would see it and give me a kind word, some empathy, some understanding of how I was feeling so I didn't feel so alone and fucked up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I was a teenager today in these circumstances, I probably would've been one of those posting videos.   \n\n\nAs an adult I've gotten to a place where I can either process my emotions a little better or just generally have people who give a shit about me that I can talk to instead but it was a very long road to get here.

            "text": "I don't do this so I don't know the answer, but I have a rebuttal to the \"it's just attention seeking\" argument that many people are making.\n\nCrying IS at attention-seeking reflex at an evolutionary level. It evolved as a means of communicating to other members of our social group that we need help. The natural function of crying is social, but culturally, we've decided that crying should be completely private, and that crying in front of others is shameful. \n\nIt has long been the norm, way before social media, to only present positive emotions. It's part of why we're told to smile for pictures, because happiness is the most socially acceptable emotion to outwardly express. I ‚Äãthink this question plays into a stigma against mental health issues - it doesn't ask about people who record themselves laughing or smiling, which are also social responses. It's essentially asking, \"Why aren't you hiding your sadness?\" because expressing it is taboo.\n\nIn recent years, many people on social media have been championing for honest outward emotion and candid discussions about struggles. I think this is the right direction. Seeing others express honest emotion can help someone who has been struggling and keeping it to themselves. I think it's especially true for tragedies that affect whole communities, like natural disasters, the death of an important person, etc. Seeing people cry publicly over it can help others process grief and know that they aren't alone. \n\nIf people are posting videos of themselves crying because they need attention, that shouldn't be looked down upon as a shameful thing. It's somebody who's suffering and is alone, often young people trapped inbad situations. They need compassion, not ridicule.",

I ended up kinda bawling my eyes out when I was streaming once.\n\nSome quick background: My best friend passed away a few years ago from ALS. I think about him a lot and am pretty constantly aware of any dates that I associate with him and memories of him. I'm guessing anybody who's lost a close friend or family member is the same way, but everybody's different.\n\nEarly last June I was going through some backlog games and decided that I'd stream one of them, GRIS, knowing nothing about it. Just in case you also know nothing about it, I'm going to put pretty much the rest of this post in spoilers. I'll put a TLDR at the end.\n\n>!As soon as the game started with a character choking up and then went on to showing that I was going to be introducing color into a colorless world, I had a good idea of what the game was really about. I remember lots of details of the day my friend died, and specifically I remember colors being muted or unremarkable. It was almost like those ads for depression medication. Anyway, I started the game midway into a stream and had to finish it on another stream a few days later.!<\n\n>!By the time I was pretty much done with the game and going through its climax I was more certain than ever that the game was about loss and grieving, and while I knew that I was especially sensitive to that subject, I was more focused on finding clues to \"confirm my theory\" than actually experiencing what the game was showing me.!< \n\n>!Then Steam notified me that I had gotten the achievement \"Acceptance\" and I just instantly went from looking for confirmation to actually processing what the game had shown me. I finally started thinking of the elements in the game--the colors, the movement abilities, the order in which everything happens--then I thought about all of it in relation to my own experience dealing with the grief of losing my best friend. I was tearing up a little bit, but I was holding it together.!<\n\n>!And then I realized what day it was: the anniversary of losing my best friend. I had known the day was coming a couple days before that, but at some point stopped being aware of it until that moment. When that realization hit me I just fell apart. Before I was relating to the game's themes through past experiences and remembered emotions. Now a lot of those emotions were suddenly present again, and...yeah.

She decided she wasn't happy, all at once and went from giving me playful head in the afternoon while the kids played outside and making social media posts about how she simply couldn't exist without me to filing for divorce in 3 months.\n\nI have never felt more devastated, emotionally destroyed, and worst of all, alone.  And I'm not looking for sympathy, I'm working through it.  I'm also not terribly interested in armchair speculation about how she's probably cheating.  I don't have any evidence of that, I have a ton of anxiety and that's not going to help.\n\nBut I dove into tiktok for a time as a distraction.  And I totally understand the phenomenon.  Tiktok in and of itself makes you feel not alone.  Whenever I would begin falling completely apart, it was made so much more grotesque and hideous to me that I was going through it 100% in desolate solitude. \n\nI thought 100 times about putting one of my breakdowns on tiktok because fuck me my gut reaction is that I just want SOMEONE to know exactly the depth and breadth of my misery.  Since she is completely impervious to it and has taken on an ice cold facade throughout this, it's not going to be her.  So why not strangers on the internet.  Better than no one right?\n\nI'm sure it felt great for the folks that did it and all the supportive comments helped them.  But at the point I am in my grief, I'm burdened with the knowledge that it won't actually help anything.  It will only provide me with momentary comfort, and after I'm healed, possibly lifetime embarrassment and shame.\n\nTL;DR: There's just this feeling of \"absolutely no one has ever felt like this\" and you're begging the world to tell you you're wrong so you feel just a little bit less alone.",

It's been awhile since I've seen it, so forgive if some of the details are slightly off or out of order.\n\nOne guy who did this was a watch collector. He didn't make much money to begin with, but insisted on throwing most of his income towards rare Rolex watches. He would then show them off on his relatively unknown and fairly crappy YouTube channel, which had a relatively small following.\n\nOne day, he got the brilliant idea to trade most of his collection for a rare Rolex Air King, valued somewhere around $50k. Guy met someone, made the trade/transaction, then drove home. At some point enroute, he realized he left his newly-acquired watch on top of his car. He stopped and checked the roof, but it was obviously long-gone at that point. He drove back up the interstate until he found it.\n\nThe watch was beat to hell, with severe road rash. So what did dude do? After pleading with everyone he knew for \"help\" (aka \"give me money to fix my watch which I obviously put all of my identity into\"), he gets on his YouTube channel. At first, he tries to lowkey play the victim card and talked about shutting down his channel, as he no longer had any watches to show. After no one really responded, it devolved into direct pleas for donations from his followers to give him money so he could buy himself watches, so he in turn could produce content. Dude teared up and cried a few times throughout this.\n\nIt was pathetic as hell.\n\nAnyways, some people got suckered into it and sent money his way. Others arranged some deals for him so he could get discounts on rebuilding his collection.\n\nI've never seen such a pathetic nor a directly blatant attempt to get sympathy from others for what was pure carelessness and a terrible case of self-identify issues.",

She said if she's gonna use social media then people are gonna get to see it's not all sunshine and rainbows for her, which I think is fair. \n\nSure, there's an attention aspect to it but anyone posting on social media ultimately just wants attention of some kind.",

            "text": "Haha I do this on my close friends story sometimes. I think for me it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve become so open about sharing emotion that it just seems like any other thing I might share with friends. Plus, if I‚Äôm using social media the way I intend to, which is to connect with people who I care about and (hopefully) care about me; it‚Äôs a connection thing. I‚Äôd hope that people would show up for me in the ways I would for them, and a lot of the times it has led to some open conversations with people and has therefore led to deeper and more meaningful friendships. Social media can be quite isolating sometimes, and it‚Äôs refreshing (to me anyways) when people are real and show they have a spectrum of experiences and emotions. Sometimes we need to know people care, or feel validated, or even just to feel seen. Having a support system is so important, and sometimes it‚Äôs hard to know who to reach out to when you‚Äôre struggling. It opens the door for people to be there for you if they are capable and willing without seemingly forcing someone to be there for you. \n\nMany people are probably uncomfortable with this and call it ‚Äúoversharing‚Äù, which I can understand. People can only handle the emotions that they can handle for themselves, and it simply means either 1) they have not learned to allow themselves to process their own trauma or feelings or 2) are simply a less emotional person, which there is nothing wrong with. I say post whatever the hell ya want on social media. Being a human is weird, might as well roll with it",

I think the simple reason in that case is that he was trying to communicate his current state of mind, which caused him to break down. He left it it his special because it was honest. In my view, we cry because our body has emotions that can‚Äôt be contained and need to be disposed of. Crying is a way of doing that. Maybe similar to the way that, if you love somebody or are angry, you feel super compelled to tell them or express it because you just can‚Äôt contain those emotions without your brain going ape-shit. Perhaps people who post do so because crying alone isn‚Äôt catharsis enough. \n\nI accidentally ran over my cat a few years back. He died in my arms. I cried so long and so hard. This might sound kinda fucked but I filmed myself crying for like ten seconds. I know having the presence of mind to do that seems almost sociopathic, but it was raw and honest and I wanted to capture that feeling so I could hold it. I‚Äôll speak for myself on this one but I also find that as i get older, extreme emotional moments get harder and harder to come by, because you‚Äôve already experience such a vast breadth of shit. So I guess I had been feeling just a little numb and it was almost a relief to know something could still hurt so much. It was comforting to know that I still had such heightened feelings available to me. So I also filmed as a reminder - kinda like a diary entry. \n\nPoint being, I‚Äôd never post that shit on any kind of social media, but I get it. My thoughts - if you see that shit and it makes you cringe, watch/do something else that doesn‚Äôt make you cringe. Some people are narcissists, some people don‚Äôt have anybody with whom to share, some people feel things strongly, some people are vulnerable or scared, and some people need to express themselves the same way an artist does; they just don‚Äôt have the tools and/or ability. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily make somebody a loser or an attention whore. There‚Äôs fucking room for those people to exist, let them.

I decided that I would try share how I am feeling, which I have never really done before (even in therapy.) I'm a victim of the \"men don't have feelings\" stigma as well as depression and anxiety that limit how much I interact with others in general. I have made a few monologues, usually involving a crying session at 3am, just to work on talking about my feelings in a serious way. This in itself was rather therapeutic, and maybe I'll be ready to do this in the presence of a therapist one day. Uploading it to social media would (hopefully) provide some positive reinforcement for me to continue sharing my feelings and encourage me to share more. Like I've said, I never had the balls to upload the videos I made out of fear of the negative attention I may receive. I also don't want to burden others with the obstacles of my life if I can avoid it. I think it will cause a lot of shock among my family and friends. Everyone knows I struggle with anxiety but only my wife knows the full extent of my mental illness. I don't know how the rest of my family and friends will react.\n\nSo I technically have not uploaded any crying videos to social media, but I've tried. And maybe I will one day. It's purely for selfish reasons, just so I can get better at sharing my feelings and hopefully have success in therapy once day. But dammit I need to be selfish sometimes to fix myself.",

I do *everything* in my power to let it out only when I‚Äôm alone alone, behind closed doors.\n\nI have particular issues with feeling abandoned, neglected, like others hate me or are disappointed in me (yes I‚Äôm going to therapy lol don‚Äôt worry). I reach out to friends and loved ones for support, but it can be scary, even if I‚Äôve been through it before. \n\nThink of that screaming, red-faced toddler. A tiny human completely overwhelmed with emotion. That‚Äôs how it feels. All-encompassing. Urgent. Emergency urgent. I have to ignore that, be an adult, explain articulately that that‚Äôs how it feels. \n\nSometimes I‚Äôm scared that... telling someone isn‚Äôt enough. I will always sound like I‚Äôm exaggerating, they will think I‚Äôm a drama queen just looking for attention because I want to be more important than other people (I am looking for attention, because I need to feel not alone, not to feel superior). You know the writing advice ‚Äúshow don‚Äôt tell‚Äù?\n\nThat‚Äôs when that urge kicks in. Does this friend who couldn‚Äôt make dinner for a totally normal reason really know how much I wanted to have a friend today? I wouldn‚Äôt send them me crying ... that‚Äôs too accusatory. But I do get an urge to just post. Just let people know without having to do the scary thing of going to someone. Just scream out into the ether ‚Äúplease someone‚Äù. I don‚Äôt even know what will make me feel better. A lot of the time, I just have to let it pass. It can last for weeks - kind of moving to the background and foreground over days - then disappear. Every time I think ‚Äúthis time it will be forever. Everyone will loose patience. Everyone will leave me. I can‚Äôt even ask them not to because it‚Äôs inhumane to ask someone to deal with me indefinitely. But maybe if people just... knew... how I really *feel*, the people who *can* handle it would help? Would reach out to me instead of me having to reach out to them?‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt post myself crying. But I do write very candid instagram stories when I need to reach out to people and am scared of reaching out individually. It‚Äôs a bandaid. \n\nAnyway, I don‚Äôt know if this is everyone who cries on social media but... if you ever see someone in over the top dramatics and want to scoff, please leave some space to imagine that maybe they really do feel that way. If that makes sense. \n\nFeel free to ask me any questions. I try to be a good person, but I‚Äôm not perfect, and I‚Äôm not afraid to talk about my pitfalls (for example, these issues in the past led me to harass my romantic partner at the time for hours of conversation - a new birth control at the time exacerbated these emotions and I didn‚Äôt realize the connection, I thought it was his fault, not making me feel loved enough.

Therefore, Im very open and honest with my audience about my mental health, going to therapy, seeking medical treatment, etc. My intent is to normalize these things so people can open up to the prospect of seeking therapy, learning about emotional regulation, or trying to get help‚Äî instead of sweeping these things under the rug. Sometimes I‚Äôll post a video of myself crying because expressing emotions openly should be normalized. Seeking professional help should be normalized. Conversations about depression, anxiety, ocd, bpd, etc. should be normalized.\n\nAs for why I have clips of myself crying? I don‚Äôt intentionally think, ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm crying, let me film myself.‚Äù My therapist has recommended I record myself crying, so I can remember why I was upset and I‚Äôll talk to myself on camera.

They got married this past October and just had their first child on the 1st of this month. I was driving in the car when I got the text that the baby was born, amid delivery complications.\n\n\nNow, I am NOT an emotional person. I cry when I'm really really mad and that's about it. I never ever happy cry, I don't really cry when I'm sad, etc. I also have a very difficult time caring about pregnancy/childbirth/having kids in general due to my past.\nBut the second that I got this text about this child being born, I immediately felt the waterworks coming. Being that I am not emotional, and that babies are the biggest turn off to me ever, I wanted to capture this incredibly raw moment for myself to look back on and so that I can maybe share it with my best friends' little girl one day to show her how much her and her family mean to me.\n\n\nI did post it to my Tik Tok to see what kind of views I could get on it (kind of for the lols almost?), but I haven't posted on any other social media. Ultimately, I would love to show my two best friends the moment one day, because I want them to know how special that moment was not just for them, but for me as well. And to show them I have a heart, ya know? Ha. But for now I'm letting them soak up all of the love and attention from their friends and family, as this is their special time and moment. I don't want to seem like I'm stealing that from them. I might eventually publish it on some of my other platforms one day for like the kid's bday? But for now, it's just sitting there for me to look back on fondly. \n\nSo yeah, it's 100% for attention when posting to social media.

            "text": "TW: Mentions of self harm and suicide\nTLDR: I did it because my parents sucked and they still do. My mental health was ignored and so was every other need and want in my life growing up.\n\nIn middle school, maybe 6th or 7th grade, I would post vents on Wattpad, a fanfiction site, and complain about my family being horrible people. I would say I have all of these different mental illnesses and disorders. At many points I talked of wanting to or attempting to commit toaster bath, self harm, etc. I think at the time I knew that I was doing it for attention because my parents were blatantly ignoring my cries for help. They said I was just a moody 12 year old and I would be fine. My home situation was terrible enough with my parents constantly fighting, my mother being an alcoholic, both parents being mentally, emotionally, and sometimes physically abusive. I always wished for siblings growing up, but I am so happy that I never had any other siblings so they would never face the same pain.\n\nAt the age of 13, my mom and dad found a photo of me on my tablet of me holding a gun to my head. It's such a cringy thing to think back on. I had just gotten home from a great day at school and when asked I told my family I felt depressed and suicidal. My mother said I can't be depressed, that I was fine. My concerns for my mental health were brushed aside and it was a horrible thing. I trusted them with how sad I felt and how unwilling I was to continue through life, and they simply didn't care. I didn't try telling my family anything about my mental health after that until high-school. They didn't care about my self harm at all, in fact they yelled at me for it and shamed me for it, and threatened to take away my tablet and not allow me to play on the computer. I didn't have a phone at the time. And I only had one friend irl. \n\nWhen high school came around, I was still self harming and contemplating not alive, and I tried telling them again in my freshman year,  first semester. They still didn't care, they said I was just an emotional teenager. I drew so many pictures of me dying or images of self harm or anything similar, and I hid the drawings. It wasn't until I had my \"first break up\" with a boy I dated for 2 and a half months. He was my preschool friend and he dumped me a week before my birthday/valentine's day. I was devastated for months. I told my friends I was thinking of suicide, I told the school crisis counselor too. Only when I told the counselor about my thoughts did my parents care, and it was because the school ordered a meeting between me, my parents, my teachers, my principal, and some of the counselors. They said I couldn't come back to school until I had a psychological evaluation. I didn't come back for 3 days. My parents were furious with me. They demanded to know every little detail I told that counselor. I was reluctantly thrown into therapy with a wonderful woman who's an art therapist. She helped me then and still continues to help me today.\n\nSo sorry for the long ramble, and any spelling mistakes since I'm on mobile. It feels much better to get this out now that I am newly graduated and living a mostly happier and much healthier life. I cringe at everything I did to bring attention to my horrible mental health online and all the begging I did for people to help me, but I at least know that it means I've grown as a person.\n\nEdit: again so sorry for the \"tragic back story tm\"",

            "text": "I did this about 9 years ago. I have 4 beautiful children(3 sons and 1 daughter). Unfortunately me and my husband lost 2 of our boys to miscarriage and SIDS. We stuck together and tried to comfort eachother. But for the most part we still felt lost not knowing what to do. So I made a post asking for advice on how to stay strong, support my husband and daughter. And also how to be able to overcome our loss and move on. I just wanted help because I honestly didn't know what to do. At first I was ok but within a few minutes I couldn't stop crying. Luckily I got tons of people looking to help my little family. We were able to move on and keep the memories of my boys alive. 2 years later little boy was born and now I still have my wonderful husband, my almost teenage daughter and little 8 year old boy to keep me busy. Asking for help isn't easy but definitely worth it.",

IRL i am very open/vulnerable and that just extends to pockets of the internet where i share my life. now i don‚Äôt really do that ever because of anxiety (& not wanting to be judged), but i think i didn‚Äôt care before... i don‚Äôt think people should be embarrassed to be sad. i think sharing sad moments reminds others that other people are also going through bad times & it‚Äôs normal to cry",

Too many attention starved bitc*es looking for their next victim.  Not that it's the fault of social media..its the fault if so many screwed up ppl in society.  Like all the slits and FAKE feminist who think the world owes them a favor and they dont even realize what feminism is about.",
