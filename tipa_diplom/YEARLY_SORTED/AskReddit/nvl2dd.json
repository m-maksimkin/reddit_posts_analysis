Black Boy, by Richard Wright. One of the most human autobiographies out there, about surviving race relations in the 20s. Helped humanize us blacks in the US.\n6. Dune (again if you're a fantasy nerd, this scratches that itch)--epic commentary on so much in our society. The whole 6 og books are great.\n7. The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy. Bring a towel, and thanks for all the fish.\n8. This is my controversial one, mostly for religious people: The text of the religion most opposite to your views that you can find.

It is, like Game of Thrones, a showcase of the levels of treachery, intrigue, trickery, luck, duty etc that people will cling to in their attempts to hold on to or gain power. There is an absolute wealth of vibrant characters that should interest everyone, and stories that span generations, and many plot points that are ripe for Netflix shows of their own. \n\nIt is also a deep dive into human psychology and psyche, and has deep philosophical ideas to showcase. Many of the Indian classical philosophies, schools of thought and ways of living are detailed, examined and evaluated in the narrative itself. It's an absolute masterclass.

It’s just so much less clumsy and overtly politicized compared to the way a lot of other people write. He’s obviously a guy from New Yorker, but he was able to look at everything through global lens, really looking at stuff big picture.\n  If nothing else it’s filled with hilarious, somber, and strange stories. He was really a person of the people, and reading his work felt like you were just ‘shooting the shit’ with that one sarcastic guy at your local eatery or bar. Rest In Power Tony 💀🔪🩸\n-\nAnd here’s your reminder to be nice to the people you come across in this industry.

Even the outset, the introduction with him discussing Alyosha as a heroic and sweet person that the narrator himself loves without end. The way in which Alyosha looks up to his mentor all the while the book slyly is discussing the way people in Russia at that time were struggling with how to view the church. The way each of the brothers is living a psychologically different kind of life and the way the book discusses how each of them is approaching the dysfunction they grew up in. \n\nThe real thing for me though is that the plot of the murder as the A story is a good story, but it alone would not have made a great work of art. Alyosha's story and the children has a moral that underlines and gives a reason for not just the larger plot but a reasonable guess as to what the cause of much suffering on Earth is and it underlines the whole of it all in a way that is so masterful that even thinking back now on the first time I read it, one of the best moments with a book.\n\nThis isn't a book necessarily, but I think people should also read a collection of Franz Kafka's short works, including things like the Zurau Aphorisms, The Hunger Artist, Poseidon, On Parables, etc. Kafka is amazing, but I think people are missing out if they are just reading his greater works. He delivers insight very directly in his shortest works and I don't know that there are as many writers who could match him.",

There's a passage where he's forced to go into one of the gas chambers just after an execution because 2 inmates had similar looking numbers and they needed to know which was which. Its a harrowing tale, and well worth a read.\n\nEdit: Tottooist - Tattooist",

Thank you all for the awards and the personal connections to an author who has been so special to me. For those asking where to start, here are some ideas.\n\nThe short story Harrison Bergeron is a great start and wouldn’t require committing to an entire book. I do think it is less humorous than most of his other work, but I love it in a different way (as do my students because I teach it every year).\n\nOthers have referenced a talk that he gave about the shape of stories. That video really helps viewers get acquainted with Vonnegut, his insight, and his delivery.\n\nAs far as books go, my favorites are Cat’s Cradle, Sirens of Titan, and Bluebeard. I also love Slaughterhouse Five and will end with my favorite passage from it. The main character has become “unstuck in time” and therefore perceives things out of traditional chronological order.\n\n“He came slightly unstuck in time, saw the late movie backwards, then forwards again. It was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this:\n\nAmerican planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighters planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments forms some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.\n\nThe formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.\n\nWhen the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.\nThe American fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids. And Hitler turned into a baby, Billy Pilgrim supposed. That wasn’t in the movie. Billy was extrapolating. Everybody turned into a baby, and all of humanity, without exception, conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve, he supposed.”\n\nNone of this managed to capture his sense of humor that I so adore, but I don’t know that I could ever do it justice. If your interest is piqued, consider picking up a book and getting to know one of my favorite people who I’ve never met!",

It really engages you in a way that a very overt story about injustice/politics might not in a context with humans.

But then, I decided to actually do what few Christians do:  Read the Bible.\n\nI poked through, about three years.  It was interesting.  Seeing the old Jewish laws in the Old Testament, and realizing that yes, they really would have built a functioning society.  And it was interesting that when the laws weren't followed, then \"God destroyed them\", but really, they could have just destroyed themselves, too.\n\nThe New Testament wasn't what I expected.  Very little of modern Christianity's rules actually come from either the Gospels (which supposedly have 'the teachings of Christ') or the letters of Paul (who was the other main influence).  I came to the conclusion that Christianity was a whole lot different than people who go to church, or people who called themselves Christian.

To know any place we must spend a long time in it, not just be a traveler-through or looking to snap a selfie then leave. We must live in it and visit it often, as though visiting an old friend, as Shepherd put it. We are not jetting off to the next summit or the next vacation or the next romantic pretend-adventure.

His experiences from the first half were what helped him develop logotherapy while his desire to provide a unique perspective of the Holocaust as a psychiatrist motivated him to keep trying to survive. \n\nWhat makes this book rather unique is how he gives an incredible insight into the psychology of Holocaust victims, particularly since he experienced it himself.

The second reason is that I actually discovered this book while in a juvenile detention center. I was in a bad place early on and this book really hit me, reminded me heavily of my own grandfather and how he would be disappointed with the decisions I was making in my life. I still think back to the day I grabbed the book because I was overcome with boredom, which resulted in me taking a book when the guard asked me.

There's no reason for it, it's just fun. He suggests that this kind of altered state of consciousness and perception (like the kind you might get from drinking, for example) is something that people just enjoy.

It makes visual in your head and I was able to picture what was sort of happening in the moment. Its a story of heartbreak, love, sadness and seeking for a way out. If you aren't the type to sit and read there is also a Netflix film on it. It has the same name. Would recommend, however the book is much more enjoyable in my opinion\n\nAnother book to give a good read would be:\n\nThe Walled City by Ryan Graudin\n\nWas an amazing book to read. It had all sorts of plots you wouldn't even imagine but it still makes sense and ties the book together. It follower to sister's and a boy who try to escape the Walled city in search of a better life. One girl is trapped in trafficking and the other is in search for her sister as she's disguised as a boy to hide her identity. The boy is trying to find a way out of the Walled city to escape his past. It's based on a real city and its such an interesting read that makes you want to never stop.\n\nBoth these books were very enjoyable and I don't usually give books ago since I have trouble finding what I enjoy.

Camus in The Myth of Sisyphus creates a reason to live with use of the most pessimistic views of life I have ever encountered. \n\nI am not recommending his book as a foundation for your own philosophy necessarily, I recommend it so that you can see that life is still worth living even within the most nihilistic pessimistic boundaries you can think of. \n\nAnother book that I've seen recommended that matches this spirit is Man's Search For Meaning. The latter is the easier read but the former is more philosophically inclined and thus has my preference. It's really up to you. \n\n\"A man wants to earn money in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of a life are devoted to the earning of that money.

Psychiatrists were not able to say with certainty if he is the world's best liar or he really has 13 different personalities in his head, each taking control at various times depending on who stands in the \"light\". If this sounds familiar, M.Night Shyamalan's \"SPLIT\" movie copied  this story, just put it into a different crime scene and added supernatural shit to it. Billy Milligan is very real however, and the book is written as if each personality is a different character physically. Sarah washed dishes while Michael did the ironing, and Jon was listening to music - this is how it is written, but you know it's 1 body, \"1 person\" doing the chores in his flat. Super interesting read for the writing style in itself. You'll question yourself if you believe in Billy's mental illness or not, and if he is punishable for his crime or not. You'll read about his life shortly before the murder takes place, during, and after up to the court hearing.",

Most horror stories and movies don't really scare me anyway, so it's not that uncommon. I loved it. While I could put it down, I'd do so with anger at the fact I was interrupted while reading such a gem!\n\nBut still, it's amazing! Around 18 books total, 13 in the first series Wardstone Chronicles. The next one, Starblade Chronicles, is a sequel to that, with 3 books. The most recent one, Brother Wulf, consists of two books (with more on their way).\n\nYou can download most of the books on [pdfdrive.com](https://pdfdrive.com) or read free online [bookscool.com](https://bookscool.com) or [readfreenovel.com](https://readfreenovel.com) for both starblade and wardstone chronicles.\n\nHowever, The Dark Assassin, Brother Wulf, and Wulf's Bane, will have to be ordered online on Amazon.\n\nThese books are amazing! I highly recommend you read them.\n\nAnd I know these aren't books, but watch The Boy and Before I Wake on Prime Video. Along with the Dragon Prince on Netflix. These are some amazing shows.",

The book is so stuffed with literary, geographical, religious, historical, cultural, and other allusions/references that you can't go two paragraphs without realizing he's hinting about something else.  And if you've never read those other literary works, studied that history, lived in some of those places or types of places, a lot of those references will swoosh over your head.  \n  \nIf- and only if- you are willing to devote the time and attention and outside study that this work demands, it will be unbelievably rewarding.  If you're just going to read the words on the pages, it's still a good story with moving characters.  But that's all it will be for you, and you'll be left wondering why so many people spend so much time talking about it, analyzing it, studying it, and so on.",

I was to be the tech, run an installation crew, and eventually inherit the company when he retired.  This was in the mid 80s, and cable was just starting to reach the county.  I turned it down thinking cable was going to kill satellite.  Little did I know cable was going to be so mismanaged that it single handedly saved the satellite business.  Plus the fact that I left my fathers house with my head screwed on so completely wrong that I was barely functional as a human being, let alone take the responsibility of any kind of leadership.\n\nAll that aside, the point is that opportunity is all around us.

Its about life's challenges, coming of age, and realizing that life is both the good and the bad rolled up into a beautiful miserable ball. It follows a pilot who crash lands in a dessert and runs into The Little Prince, a starry eyed small boy in love with a flower on another planet. My favorite exchange from the book is when the Prince speaks with a fox.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I am looking for friends. What does that mean -- tame?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"It is an act too often neglected,\" said the fox. \"It means to establish ties.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"To establish ties?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Just that,\" said the fox. \"To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world....”",

However, because it is a lot to ask of a reader, I think *Anna Karenina* would be a fine stand in.\n\n(If I was simply recommending what I personally think is the greatest, most confusingly good book of all time that would be my desert island book, I'd go with *Infinite Jest.*                             \nBut I think reading Tolstoy may be more important in a reader's lifelong reading journey)",

It starts with a rich anecdote conveying two different perspectives, one of the poor dad who is the author’s actual dad and the rich dad who taught him the way money works.\n\nMany aspects are touched upon with narratives that are relatable and eye-opening. You will see how different perspectives about money take the dads to different places. It also talks about the compounding effects of money and the implications of different financial choices.\n\nI would also like to recommend one other book that I always go back to. It is Jonathan Livingston Seagull. It is a rather short book that you can complete in a couple of hours. It is full of illustrations and vivid descriptions. It is the story of a seagull that stands out from the crowd and aspires to push beyond limits, seeking excellence. It touches upon different struggle elements that many of us go through in an uplifting way.\n\nHaving a bad day at work or feeling down on a normal day, this book would lighten you up and set you up on the path of working towards your dream. It is by far one of the most impactful books I have ever read.\n\nIf you are up for a serious one, I would suggest Antifragile: Things that gain from disorder. This one is a bold book offering a practical perspective of the world. It is about strategies to gain from random events instead of getting harmed by them.\n\nHope you have a great reading experience!",

It helps us learn how to distinguish dependency from love; how to become a more sensitive parent; and ultimately how to become one’s own true self. \n\nRecognizing that, as in the famous opening line of his book, “Life is difficult” and that the journey to spiritual growth is a long one, Dr. Peck never bullies his readers, but rather guides them gently through the hard and often painful process of change toward a higher level of self-understanding”",

White (english author in 1958) which looks at themes of human nature (especially in regards to the concept of \"justice\" or \"power\"), ethics and the problem of \"might makes right\" (and any form of that).\n\nIt's split into 4 parts, and the first part might be something lots more people are familiar with... this part (\"The Sword in the Stone\") was the basis for the disney film of the same name. Other people might recognise it from X-Men, it gets referenced an awful lot there (both in the comics and in the movies - it's that book you always see Magneto reading from or Professor X using as a teaching tool).\n\nThe books start off with Arthur learning about the world through his adventures with Merlin, and are a lighthanded account of his upbringing, which reads like an affectionate parody of the Arthurian legend. But over the course of the next three parts, the tone gradually darkens as the topics move onto Arthur contemplating death and legacies, and dealing with the consequences of his naivety in trying to harness \"might\" for the power of goodness.\n\nI read the first part as a kid, and I definitely think I learned some lessons from it... one part that has always stuck with me is some of the lines spoken by Merlin, when they're discussing conflict and the perpetuation of conflict (as people seem to fight to \"avenge\" the past, and we get stuck in a spiral of people avenging wrongdoings, and then avenging that avenging) and whether a \"just\" reason for war can ever exist, as the other clans around the british isles seem to preparing for a fight.\n\n>\"If my father,\" said the King, \"killed the Queen of Orkney's father, then I think she has a good reason for wanting her husband to rebel against me.\"  \n\"It is only a personal reason. Personal reasons are no excuse for war.\"  \n\"And furthermore,\" the King continued, \"if my race has driven out the Gaelic race, then I think the Queen of Orkney's subjects have a good reason too.\"  \nMerlyn scratched his chin in the middle of the beard, with the hand which held the reins, and pondered.  \n\"Uther,\" he said at length, \"your lamented father, was an aggressor. So were his predecessors the Saxons, who drove the Old Ones away. But if we go on living backward like that, we shall never come to the end of it. The Old Ones thelmselves were aggressors, against the earlier race of the copper hatchets, and even the hatchet fellows were aggressors, against some earlier crew of esquimaux who lived on shells. You simply go on and on, until you get to Cain and Abel. But the point is that the Saxon Conquest did succeed, and so did the Norman Conquest of the Saxons. Your father settled the unfortunate Saxons long ago, however brutally he did it, and when a great many years have passed one ought to be ready to accept a status quo. Also I would like to point out that the Norman Conquest was a process of welding small units into bigger ones—while the present revolt of the Gaelic Confederation is a process of disintegration. They want to smash up what we may call the United Kingdom into a lot of piffling little kingdoms of their own. That is why their reason is not what you might call a good one.\"  \nHe scratched his chin again, and became wrathful.  \n\"I never could stomach these nationalists,\" he exclaimed. 'The destiny of Man is to unite, not to divide. If you keep on dividing you end up as a collection of monkeys throwing nuts at each other out of separate trees.\"  \n...  \nLater on, he began to speak in a gentler tone.  \n\"Did you know,\" he asked rather wistfully, \"that I was one of the Old Ones myself? My father was a demon, they say, but my mother was a Gael. The only human blood I have comes from the Old Ones. Yet here I am denouncing their ideas of nationalism, being what their politicians would call a traitor—because, by calling names, they can score the cheap debating points. And do you know another thing, Arthur? Life is too bitter already, without territories and wars and noble feuds.\"",

Enough so that in endgame when they come up with their time travel shit, they made up a reference to the author they call in the movie “the Deutsch principle” (not a real thing they just wanted to reference him cause the dude knows his shit)\n\n100% worth reading and will definitely change how you look at the universe, and it’s written in a way that’s really easy for the layman to pick up on, I am no science expert by any means and never even took chemistry or physics (still got my AA tho, Florida is weird af) and it still made perfect sense tbh.

Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love. \n\n2) DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY \n\nNothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering. \n\n3) DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS \n\nFind the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life. \n\n4) ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST \n\nYour best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are tired as opposed to well-rested. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgement, self-abuse, and regret.\n\nI love BE IMPECCABLE with your word. If a man doesn’t have his word he has nothing. I feel like too many times people say things to avoid conversation or conflict. The art of conversation is all but dead. You can butt heads with someone on many topics and still be friends but people would rather not try l if theres one conflict.  People don’t understand that credibility and character are chipped away when they say one thing but do another.  \n\nAfter working in corporate America for 18 years, I now freelance.

It's war, patriotism, questioning of leadership, and the morality of killing. The other dark parallel that keeps me coming back is how the \"bugs\" are portrayed and how the goal of the military is to dehumanize both the enemy and the individual. Heinlen is my favorite author of all time. My moms entry would be \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" also by Heinlen about how a child born on Mars and raised by aliens might be more human than any of us on earth claim to be. The early 1900s discrimination is there, but for the time Heinlen was an EXTREAMLY progressive author.",

He awakes in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a destination. It's a place where your life is explained to you by five people, some of whom you knew, others who may have been strangers. One by one, from childhood to soldier to old age, Eddie's five people revisit their connections to him on earth, illuminating the mysteries of his \"meaningless\" life, and revealing the haunting secret behind the eternal question: \"Why was I here?\" \"\n\n I have personally read this book multiple times and absolutely love it.

It explains everything he did and does to achieve a next level way of living.\n\nIt also contains his life story of how he found out about cold exposure and breathing techniques. There’s a heartbreaking chapter that really makes you feel something when you read it.\n\nIt’s also a great casual read - the language isn’t intense/complex and for people like me with ADHD it makes for a pleasurable read.\n\nHonourable mention:\n\nJared Lanier - 10 reasons to get off social media.\n\nThe author is a guy who was at the start of technology and has worked with many people who were involved in the making of the scary algorithms of Facebook and Instagram.

Any one even remotely familiar with his stand up routine knows his bit about helping his mom kill herself, and the book opens with that story.  It then proceeds over 19 chapters to recount key moments in his life where his mom was a guiding or influential force in the course of his life and career.  Havent finnished it yet but am close.  It really is a love letter from an unconventional guy to his unconventional mother.  Plus its goddamn hilarious, if you dig his routine.",

But here's a list I currently have: \n\nThe Gene - it's a history of genetics from  bad takes on genetics from supposed \"smart\" people, to the do-ers of the scientific world who have little recognition but probably are responsible for modern medicine. \n\nEmperor of all Maladies - Same author writes about the history of cancer. How it evolved in humans how different societies interpret Cancer and how cancer develops in the human body. \n\n\nGuns Germs and Steel - if you want to know why one country has a supposed 'edge' over another from a historical perspective, this book explains from a pre-historical and geographical context questions about why certain countries are rich and others are poor. \n\nA Promised Land - you can hate his guts or admire him, but you should read the book because in my opinion, it's the closest the average person will get to how the White House operates on a day to day basis. Even if you think he made terrible mistakes, it at least gives insight on the kinds of decisions a leader of a country typically has to make and the trade offs associated with them.",

Like all great teachers, Ishmael refuses to make the lesson easy; he demands the final illumination to come from within ourselves. Is it man's destiny to rule the world?

If you like Sci-Fi, this is a must, but honestly, it's so good that I'm sure any fiction reader will like it.\n\nIf you feel compelled, after reading that one, there are a few more in the *Remembrance of Earth's Past* series that are absolutely amazing.  *The Dark Forest* and *Death's End* are so good.  Each book is a different type of book from the other, so don't go into them expecting the same kind of novel throughout.\n\n*The Dark Forest* is actually my favourite of all of them, and really made me reevaluate some things I thought I understood.  At the time, I couldn't really get into *Death's End* but I can't help but think about the ending nearly every day.\n\n*The Power* by Naomi Alderman is a stunning book, and changed my life forever.  No joke.  It really puts some things into perspective.  My favourite quote comes from this book - \n\n\"He has written in the scribbled notes for his book:  \"At first we did not speak our hurt because it was not manly.  Now we do not speak it because we are afraid and ashamed and alone without hope, each of us alone.  It is hard to know when the first became the second.\"\"",

The Almost Moon by Alice Sebold makes me look at my relationship with my mother and sisters. (Anything by Alice Sebold will make you think I also love her memoir Lucky I found it comforting that she was so humourous). The Lovely Bones also makes you look relationships within your family.\n\nMilk and Honey by Rupi Kaur allowed me to realize that you can be angry and do not have to be eloquent when you express it to make other comfortable. Homebody by her is also a good one.\n\nWhen things get too much and too heavy The Tale of Despereaux by Kate DiCamillo brings in the light and makes everything warm and soothing like soup. I read it often.",

And for those who might consider watching the film, don't :p If you're not about books, sure, although even then the film is below average in my opinion (not enough time/spacing to care about any of the characters really).",

Throughout the story they meet many different interesting characters with a lot of deep emotions to share. \n\nIt tought me and countless others to be nice to everyone because everyone has their story, and a lot of other good values that everyone should have, while also teaching that life is not fair.

Royal Road estimates the total length to be approximately 2,930 pages (805,984 words total).  Dont let the length discourage you though as I feel like it really pulls you in.  \n\n**Synopsis from Royal Road:** Zorian is a teenage mage of humble birth and slightly above-average skill, attending his third year of education at Cyoria's magical academy. He is a driven and irritable young man, consumed by a desire to ensure his own future and free himself of the influence of his family, whom he resents for favoring his brothers over him. Consequently, he has no time for pointless distractions or paying attention to other people's problems. As it happens, time is something he is about to get plenty of. On the eve of the Cyoria's annual summer festival, he is killed and brought back to the beginning of the month, just before he was about to take a train to Cyoria. Suddenly trapped in a time loop with no clear end or exit, Zorian will have to look both within and without to unravel the mystery before him. And he does have to unravel it, for the time loop hadn't been made for his sake and dangers lurk everywhere... Repetition is the mother of learning, but Zorian will have to first make sure he survives to try again - in a world of magic, even a time traveler isn't safe from those who wish him ill.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/) \\- Coming in at almost 7 million words, (you read that right) this is also a great story that is a bit different.  The main character suddenly finds herself in a fantasy world that has game like mechanics (think Classes, Skills, and leveling systems).  Rather than the usual story of the main character becoming a hero that aims to save the world this story takes a bit of a different approach and I was surprised by how much I am enjoying it so far.\n\n**Synopsis:** An inn is a place to rest, a place to talk and share stories, or a place to find adventures, a starting ground for quests and legends.  \nIn this world, at least. To Erin Solstice, an inn seems like a medieval relic from the past. But here she is, running from Goblins and trying to survive in a world full of monsters and magic. She’d be more excited about all of this if everything wasn’t trying to kill her.  \nBut an inn is what she found, and so that’s what she becomes. An innkeeper who serves drinks to heroes and monsters–  \nActually, mostly monsters. But it’s a living, right?  \nThis is the story of the Wandering Inn.",

I saw this as a very interesting way to view myself  from the outside in relation to others. \n\nThis book sort of put my life into perspective especially how I dealt with others. For instance when a negative event befalls me, I take a step back and look at myself through an outside lens. Then I see the things I lack or did wrong. I get out of the view that the earth revolves around me and put my existence on the periphery. And take a more wholistic approach to social circles. I’m a human who won’t live forever and doesn't know all that much and makes mistakes, I am constantly going through stress. Others are going through the exact sane thing. We all want the same things. Today I, he/her, the other side may have made a lapse in judgement, but we are all fumbling through life failing to understand ourselves, others and how to treat ourselves in relationship to others. \n\nThen I work to improve myself.

It’s a memoir written by Ishmael Beah, an author from Sierra Leone. The book is a firsthand account of Beah's time as a child soldier during the civil war in Sierra Leone.\n\nTaken from the amazing description :\n\nThis is how wars are fought now: by children, hopped-up on drugs and wielding AK-47s. Children have become soldiers of choice. In the more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them. \n\nWhat is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived. \n\nIn A Long Way Gone, Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story: how at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he'd been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found that he was capable of truly terrible acts.\n \nThis is a rare and mesmerizing account, told with real literary force and heartbreaking honesty. \n\n\"My new friends have begun to suspect I haven't told them the full story of my life. \n'Why did you leave Sierra Leone?' \n'Because there is a war.' \n'You mean, you saw people running around with guns and shooting each other?' \n'Yes, all the time.' \n'Cool.' \nI smile a little. \n'You should tell us about it sometime.' \n'Yes, sometime.'\"",

It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If a story seems moral, do not believe it. If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie. There is no rectitude whatsoever. There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil.”",

History is filled with people who have crossed immense distances and survived despite horrific odds. None of them, however, has achieved the extraordinary feat Rawicz has recorded. He and his companions crossed an entire continent-the Siberian arctic, the Gobi desert and then the Himalayas-with nothing but an ax, a knife, and a week's worth of food.... His account is so filled with despair and suffering it is almost unreadable. But it must be read-and re-read.\" —Sebastian Junger, author of The Perfect Storm)\n\n🔹Short Funny Read🔹 \"Runny Babbit\" - Shel Silverstein.  Supposed to be a kid's book, but it gave me the hardest, longest, side cramping, tear streaming laugh of my adult life.  I don't know it's original goal.  In my family of dyslexics though, trying to read this book aloud is the perfect payback for being the \"non-dyslexic\" of the group.  It gets better the further you read (and DO read it aloud).

For example, within the first few pages I learned how Morse code works, as well as braille, sign language, barcodes, then boolean algebra and transistors, etc. For a dummy like me, just getting me to read a whole book is an accomplishment but getting me to read a book about engineering and math is special.\n\nAs for why everyone should read it? Well, computers are everywhere and I feel like knowing how they work to the point where you can understand the why's in coding can only benefit a technological society like ours. And this is easily the most appropriate book on the market for teaching that why to the general population.",

The greatest untold story and unsung triumph: that we may be living in the single greatest period of human history despite the distortions of news media on our perception of how things are going (which follow a policy of “if it bleeds, it leads” and exploit the availability heuristic and other psychological weaknesses that make us more unnecessarily pessimistic). \n\nThis book is essential because it puts the lie to the idea “eat drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.” So many people are made to feel that things are just getting worse and worse, despite the struggle of policy makers and scientists and civil rights leaders to the contrary, fostering a jaded disenchantment with the world that feels that nothing works, that nothing has ever worked, that we may as well retire into our isolated corner and never again try to change the world for the better.\n\nAlso, if you have a chance, read **Doing Good Better** by William McAskill, founder of the now famous Effective Altruism Movement. He makes a case for evidence-based charity and paints a picture of how we could data science and donate our way to a better world.",

It really just makes you think about the harsh reality of war and the effect it has on somebody's psyche. New readers beware, it starts off simple but gets pretty heavy and dark towards the end.",

This is the best Finnish book ever (although it was Sillanpää who got our only Nobel). Even though it’s popular in Finland, it’s fair to guess unlike other suggestions in this thread, you have not heard of it before.\n\nThe story, as if written autobiographically by an ancient Egyptian doctor, addresses every phenomena known to human. A bit like Forrest Gump (without the naivity and underlined comedy), Sinuhe gets into the whirlwind of war, love, loss, power, knowledge... just read it, I’m not doing justice to how great it is. The main idea is that there is nothing new under the sun, and as time goes by from the moment of writing (1945), the more amazing the work of Waltari seems. There was always a debate whether he was a genius or lost his mind - I’m betting it was both.\n\nIt was made into a Hollywood film in 50s, but that was not too successful and did not make this book a global classic it deserves to be.

Unlike many war novels it doesn’t glorify the battle, it doesn’t show a parade of people applauding when you get home. It shows that war is hell and nothing more. \n\nThis book also has a history. Hitler had the author’s (Enrich Maria Remarque) family killed to scare him off. He had the book burned along with those of Jewish authors. He was scared that the story it told would dismay the German people from wanting Hitler’s total war as he called it. It was so heart breaking it was outlawed. \n\nThe story starts with his troop being marched to front where they are then bombarded with mortar fire and Enrich describes seeing his friends blown to bits. His troop celebrates in a solum way because now that half of them are dead they get extra rations. After a battle his best friend is hospitalized and eventually dies. After fighting for a while more he is allowed a trip back home (they did this for soldier moral) and when he gets there it was nothing he was promised. During the war schools were forced to try and get students to sign of as soldiers. They would tell them how they would be heroes, how much everyone would love them when they got home. When he got back he felt betrayed by his teachers and his community who told him to sign up. He gets back and he’s so disconnected from normal life he is alienated and he feels his only home is now the raging field because no one else can accept him where he grew up. He goes back to the front and fights seeing gore and tragedy and he hates himself because he gets used to it. \n\nThat’s a summary. I highly recommend reading the full book though.",

I was one of those teenagers who was uncomfortably interested in history and I read it because it's a book about how to train young samurai and how fucking cool is *that!?* \n\nIt ended up actually being remarkably insightful in a lot of really unexpected ways. There are self-contained ideas and lessons in it that break down pretty far reaching concepts in very succinct ways that were right in the wheelhouse of what my teenaged brain needed to hear.\n\nFor instance:\n\n>A helmet is usually thought to be very heavy, but when one is attacking a castle or something similar, and arrows, bullets, large rocks, great pieces of wood and the like are coming down, it will not seem the least bit so.\n\nReading a little in depth on this, it's an admonition to understand that something may seem unwelcome but you'd be thankful for its presence when you need it. It helped me think beyond my initial feelings or impressions on something and try to understand if/why it might be necessary.\n\nThe book is full of these types of idea. I still have my old copy and every once and a while I'll open it back up and start reading it again. \n\n[**Khalil Gibran's \"The Prophet\"**](https://archive.org/details/TheProphetByKhalilGibran/mode/2up) - I have to confess, this one is a mystery to me. I've read it probably a hundred times and I keep getting drawn back to this book. I've gotten rid of probably ten copies over the course of my life and every time a copy somehow finds its way into my possession again.\n\nThe kind of outlook on life that Al-Mustafa talks about is radically different from what I think a lot of people are used to and there's a strong sense of connection with the people around you that comes through in the writing. I didn't really have a lot of that growing up so I think that's a big part of why this book was so important to me growing up.\n\n[**CrimethInc's \"Days of War, Nights of Love\"**](https://archive.org/details/DaysOfWarNightsOfLove/mode/2up) - This is probably the \"if you only ever read one book\" I'd pick. DOWNOL is...really difficult to describe other than it's a *radical* re-alignment of your view on the world. It made me ask a lot of questions I'd never thought to ask and look at things I'd never thought to look at.\n\nThe chapter on Love is probably one of the single best pieces of writing I've ever read in my entire life. Even if you eschew the book as a whole, the chapter on Love is worth a read.",

The idea of the “genuine article” has stuck with me for years, and the way an entire culture as it existed can seemingly die so quickly as a result of war gives a unique view on an at least somewhat modern example of Western imperialism. \n\nIt’s an especially valuable read paired with the debate on the bombing of Japan, Japanese internment camps in the States, and a general awareness of how the rest of the Western world treated Japan around and after WWII. There are very modern, transcultural, and transtemporal themes as well, so it doesn’t read as a history book and instead almost as a coming of age story.

But is it possible that all the bad things going on – and I don’t have to list them, for we all know what they are – are a reaction, a dragging undertow, to a forward movement in the human social evolution that we can’t easily see? Perhaps, looking back, let’s say in a century or two centuries, is it possible people will say, ‘That was a time when extremes battled for supremacy. The human mind was developing very fast in the direction of self-knowledge, self-command, and as always happens, as always has to happen, this thrust forward aroused its opposite, the forces of stupidity, brutality, mob thinking’? I think it is possible. I think that this is what is happening.\n\n—Doris Lessing",

Reading this really helped pull me out of a tricky time and truly catalysed my healing journey.\nIt is an account of revelations of self, ego and the nature of consciousness. While he was able to find this wisdom on psychedelics, the book isn’t just about taking acid- it is about his reflections on life which are succinct yet numinous. Watts uses lots of metaphor and poetic language to express his philosophical musings which makes his ideals really viceral and tangible, his writing style is a joy to read. He also does an amazing job of describing the poisonous hold of ego, which unlocked many personal revelations for me.\n\nThis is a very special book, Maybe this can bless someone else the same way that it did me \n\n(Free PDF link) \n\nhttps://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/joyous_cosmology.pdf",

I hadn't seen it on my own scroll but I'm sure everyone has heard of it.\n\nThe Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is universal truth distilled into such simple eloquence. I first read it in HS and it helped in confirming a lot of the intuitive things I knew to be true about the world. But as my level of consciousness has risen and as I've experienced more in life, I learn new lessons on EVERY REREAD. I have never learned as much about myself from a book outside of this and Name of The Wind x Patrick Rothfuss. \n\nThe Alchemist is a short read and entertaining, but if you dig a little deeper, the magic that book contains is on a god-tier level in my honest opinion 🌞(SO EVEN IF YOU ALREADY READ IT, REREAD IF IT'S BEEN A MINUTE)",

Expressive metaphors, profound aphorisms, descriptive language, confounding contradictions, and more are all rendered beautifully by the King James translators. \n\n4 Between the Bible and Greek philosophy, you pretty much have the foundation of traditional western morality, which (with some other influences) gave rise to things like the US Constitution and set the stage for our current state of democracy. \n\n5 The character of Christ.

This has probably been mentioned by now in the thread, but as the oldest surviving piece of human literature, you could argue that this is where it all started.

Maybe not, compared to mainstream and modern novels. The Epic is still worth reading because even back when people lived in mud brick homes and the ancient equivalent of New York City was anywhere with a population of 40,000+, exploration of the human condition was still something that intrigued people. \n\nIt's a story about justice, seeking glory, friendship, mortality, and whether or not immortality is something as literal as \"never dying\".\n\nEveryone should read it at least once in their lives, if not only to experience where our literary tradition as a species first began.",

It's a book about a small town in America (near Orlando if I remember correctly) that bands together to continue living life after an atomic bomb goes off. It starts out pre-bomb, guides through the immediate aftermath of the bomb, and the months of what they endured after the bomb. Everything from bands of scavengers threatening their safety, to needing to have actual food/water to even going out in search of salt after they start having issues from a lack of sodium. It's a fantastic book that I think everyone should read at least once. Also a book called Milkweed by Jerry Spinelli, it follows a Jewish boy in poland during WW2, it describes life from his perspective as anti-semetic views become more commonplace, people getting removed from their homes and put together and eventually him trying to escape from what would become the holocaust.

A monster calls’ is also a touching tale worth the read, covering the concept of loss in such an intense way. \n\n‘Every soul a star’ Tells a beautiful story of friendship and change. \n\n‘Bullies’ Ed Wicke (the only author I remembered .-.) is a comedically wackytale that is definitely worth the read. \n\n‘1000 year old boy’, ‘What not to do if your invisible’ and ‘Time travelling with a hamster’ are funny while covering things you would think about like time travel or turning invisible. \n\nAnd lastly, ‘The land of Neverendings’ is a tale I think 10-14 year olds should definitely read. It’s a beautiful read that covers the concept of loss and moving on in a great way. \n\nThese are just some books in the wide range you can find, most directed to a younger audience but definitely still lovely reads that are very enjoyable.",

She ends up being sold to a saloon owner in Idaho and the book focuses on both her time as a slave and eventually a free woman.  It’s a very interesting story and the author’s prose is to my memory often hauntingly descriptive. Her homestead where she lived after being freed until she died was restored in the 1980s and is a national heritage site. It’s along the Salmon River in Idaho, I got to see it on a boat tour as a teen.\n\nGreedily I would like to add a second book, especially for my peeps in the USA. Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury... I read it in high school and it’s the only assigned reading I ever voluntarily reread. I have been thinking about that book a lot lately. How the wife spends all her time in a room acting out dramas with strangers on her tv screens instead of spending time with her husband or friends. How books are banned and burned and the pursuit of knowledge outside your own field of work is discouraged by the government and frowned upon or flat out distrusted by your community. I’m feeling some real parallels between the world Bradbury paints and the social climate we’re living with here in the states right now. It’s something I thought was a fantasy when I was 15 but now I’m starting to feel much closer to the main character than I care for.",

Truly a game-changer for the ordinary person working to make a good life for a family and then retire well.\n\nDescription from Amazn:\n\nThe bestselling The Millionaire Next Door identifies seven common traits that show up again and again among those who have accumulated wealth. Most of the truly wealthy in this country don't live in Beverly Hills or on Park Avenue-they live next door. This new edition, the first since 1998, includes a new foreword for the twenty-first century by Dr. Thomas J. Stanley.\n\nReview\nThe implication of The Millionaire Next Door...is that nearly anybody with a steady job can amass a tidy fortune. ― Forbes \n\nThe kind of information that could lift the economic prospects of individuals more than any government policy... The Millionaire Next Door has a theme that I think rings very true...\"Hey, I can do it. You can do it too!\" -- Rush Limbaugh \n\n[A] Remarkable book. ― The Washington Post \n\nA nerve has been hit....[For] people who want to become wealthy. ― USA Today \n\nA primer for amassing wealth through frugality. ― The Boston Globe \n\nAn interesting sociological work. ― Business Week \n\nA fascinating examination of the affluent in American society. ― The Dispatch (Lexington, NC), (Nc) Dispatch \n\nThese, for the wise, are tips for all of us....A very readable book. ― Cox News Service \n\nDebunks the image of the rich as high-living spendthrifts. ― U.S. News and World Report \n\nI love the book, The Millionaire Next Door. It talks about how it is a myth that most millionaires in America have inherited their money. The fact is, we have created such a great country over 250 years. We have actually found the way for poor people to go from nothing to huge wealth and to create a life-changing opportunity for their children and grandchildren. We celebrate it, write movies about it, and our libraries are full of books about it. There is nothing wrong with that. -- Bernie Sanders \n\nThe authors mine reams of data to show the surprisingly frugal traits millionaires have in common. \"The main lesson provided is that high income does not equal wealth,\" said J.R. Rosskamp, managing director of Veritas Partners, Inc., a business consulting firm. Rosskamp calls \"Millionaire Next Door\" a \"must read, and the earlier the better.\" ― Chicago Tribune \n\nThe authors mine reams of data to show the surprisingly frugal traits millionaires have in common. \"The main lesson provided is that high income does not equal wealth,\" said J.R.

Imagine, if Hitler had taken office on day one and said, “tomorrow we build the ovens and start murdering millions.” No one would have done it.

If you hate someone, it's the overarching bad guy, but he barely even takes part in the plot, so he's no factor, meaning I won't count him.\n\nYou can tell when the story is reaching it's end, without lookig at the page number. And for a plot as simple as a marathon till only one last person is standing, it's beautifully told because you feel as part of the group of friends in the story. You cheer for them, you want them to be happy, but you know that ain't ginna happen.\n\nThere's a lot of sub context to the book and it was written by Stephen King using his alter ego Richard Bachman. It's not you classic King horror story, but it feels more like a criticism to society, capitalism, dictatorships, and whatever you can make up for it.\n\nI can't make this book enough justice, so go read it.

They each explore the big theme of society's hostility to genius, and feature genius protagonists who are unlikeable, smug a-holes. The books each have a lot to say, in roundabout ways, about collectivism and objectivism and consumerism and plenty of other -isms. And while they come to at least some of the same conclusions, the books seem to sit on opposite ends of an ideological spectrum.\n\nI imagine most fans of either book are slightly aggravated by its hero but positively terrified by  the hero of the other book.\n\nIt was John Kennedy Toole's only novel and won the Pulitzer Prize after his death.

The main character is a little rat, but he pulls off some insane things. it has some pretty interesting concepts too. Whenever i felt that the story was getting a little boring, i could just think: No worries, it’ll get interesting again real soon. It’s public domain so you can just look it up and read it. I will warn you, it’s over 500 chapters, but imo it was completely worth it.\n\nOn a side note, The Sound of Thunder by Ray Bradbury makes for an interesting conversation about time travel.",

It's about 7 tribes of dragons currently going through a war over who should be the next queen if one of the tribes (inheritance of the throne in this world is decided by a challenge for the throne where the queen and one of their daughters or nieces fight to the death, not by who the oldest is at the time of the queen's death. Also yeah it's only females) this war happened because the queen of one of the tribes was killed be a human and noone knew who would get the throne. While this is a somewhat boring conflict to have to fill 5 books (yes I know there are 14 but they're in arcs of 5) but it's a story about the characters, not the world they're in. This makes ever character extremely interesting to read about, even making exposition dumps feel more natural and entertaining. This is extra amazing because each book has a different protagonist, so you can read with the thoughts of almost every main character. Also this means ever character has a TON of depth. I've heard many people say the main villain in books 6-10 is one of if not the best in all of childrens' literature, and even being really high up there in overall literature. This is coming from someone who's entire youtube channel was them either writing their own book or reviewing others, so it isn't from them just not knowing anyone better. Just to try to prove how amazing this villain is, I will tell you this: they make a bunch of terrible evil decisions, but you can understand every. Single. One. Also, you know their good qualities too, they are truly trying to get what's best for everyone, but just doesn't know how to do it.\nThe person who did those book reviews, by the way, did them with someone else, and they and the other person would make hour long podcasts per book that had ~10 minutes of a plot summary, a tiny bit of the problems with the books because there just aren't many to talk about, and the entire rest of the hour long video is just praise. One of them had so little criticism I can't even remember if it had any (it's the main book on the super great villain, a separate book that isn't counted as a main series book)\nAnother great thing is that nothing happens without reason, and no named character is named without reason. And only like 4 characters in the entire series say something but aren't named, 3 of which are because it's in the middle of a crowd",

Unironically this series has changed my life for the better and it was delivered in the form of a fantastic story in an awe inspiring world. Read his other series, Mistborn is good and it's shorter, but *please* read Stormlight. I cannot reccomend it enough. I can't overstate how hard these books hit, with how realistic these portrayals are, and how they can make you emphasize. You might not be able to relate to magic warriors soaring through the sky, but you *can* emphasize and relate to the struggles they have, with thinking they aren't good enough, and, over time, accepting that despite that, there is never a journey that isn't worth taking.",

I guess you could consider me “disenfranchised” but I’ve never felt that way. These books helped me achieve everything I’ve wanted so far and I actually apply the concepts in these on the daily:\n\n*The Autobiography of Malcolm X - Alex Haley/Malcolm X*\n\n-The most comprehensive account of a profound man who lived an absolutely incredible life. Makes me sad because although he held some crazy views at one point, he makes it clear that his paradigm for life was one of change and growth, and he was killed while undergoing the biggest metamorphosis of his life. I really think he’d be a great mind to have today to cut through the noise of recent events. \n-Gave me a core set of beliefs that really led me to understanding who I am. Also shows you the benefit of honesty at all times and how much that helps you become a person of substance. No more white lies, no bullshit. \n-Helps with perspective on adversity and how you can use it to gain an edge.\n\n*The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck - Mark Manson* \nOutstanding easy read that helps you direct your effort and attention -fucks- only to things that matter to you. Very important in this day and age for young people to understand how to find their direction. \n\n*The Millionaire Next Door - Thomas J. Stanley* \nThe most important book I’ve ever read for financial responsibility. Quick read that Gives you an entirely different view of money. Monies are not fun coupons, It is a resource not to be squandered. Interesting page turner that gives you the formula to become a millionaire, if you have enough discipline and patience you can get there. And it’s not some Tony Robbins alpha male bullshit, it’s a truly honest and proven path to financial freedom, and gives you countless examples of how most millionaires in the country (80% of whom are new wealth) do not appear it at first glance. They drive normal cars, shop at GAP and Costco, their kids go to public school and they thrift as if they lived paycheck to paycheck. It even shows you how they buy cars, use credit, and countless other things. I used it when I was just starting my business on the side and working full time at a bar to spot whales that got me initial funding and credit. Amazing. \n\n*To Sell is Human - Daniel Pink*\nYou might think you can skip this because you’re not in sales, but it’s quite the opposite. Basically, *Death of a Salesman* is bullshit and everybody is in sales today essentially, as in; if you want success in business, you must persuade people almost constantly. this shows you the best and most natural way to do so. Caused a measurable increase in my monthly sales totals.\n\nAnyway, these are the ones I’ve found most profound that have shaped the lens through which I view my life. But My quest to be a success was born of want because I never could do things or get things I wanted or sometimes needed as a kid, and I swore to myself that my kids still have everything they need, and I needed to complete my journey so I can teach them how to navigate their world to build their own success, with the peace of mind that if anything happened to me, they’ll always have a safety net. So if that’s what you’re after, these books WILL get you there in time. Baby steps!",

When the unit started the teacher made us do normal English class stuff, like researching every little detail of the story before we even read it. I didn't do that. Instead, I kept dreading having to actually read it, even though we were only assigned 4 out of the 24 books in it. \n\nThe day to read the first book came, and I kid you not: that night I read the entirety of The Odyssey, all 24 books, and even reread some of my favorite parts (that could be anywhere between a line to more than 3 books long) multiple times. Heck, I was even leafing through the translations, pronunciations, even genealogies at the beginning and end of the copy. That may have been the most fascinated I was with any book, well, not counting that Wings of Fire phase I went through in middle school...\n\nIt was funny though, after that night I suddenly lost all interest in the story, the rest of the lesson, and overall did pretty poorly on the unit about the book. However, the person I was that night would be proud that I'm still promoting it here. \n\nI've decided I'm going to read The Odyssey again this summer, and hopefully it'll be as I thought it was when I first read it!",

One day a tile from their memorial statue of the man and sentence with the letter Z falls off. The town council/church decide that this is a sign means that the letter Z should be stricken from the English language, and it’s use is now prohibited (a weird push for power and control.) however, as tiles keep falling from the memorial pangram, and neighbors turn on each other (reporting each other for language violations when they have petty squabbles, for instance), more letters are banned from being spoken or written, until everything spirals out of control.\n\nWhat makes this book brilliant, however, is that it is written in the form of mail sent between citizens and family. That means as letters begin being banned, they vanish from the book. Ten chapters in, the author is writing perfectly legible communications without using the letters  B,C,D,F,J,K,Q, and Z. For example, here’s an excerpt:\n\nSweet Tassie,\nThey will not let me into the prison to see you. I have spent the entire postnoon, all the early hours ensuing my arrival in town waiting. Waiting here on the prison’s visitors’ lawn to see you.\n\nThey tell us nothing (will they even give this letter to you?). It is very upsetting. I want you to grasp how greatly I love you. I won’t try to learn why you sent the threats. \n\nWe’re anything to happen to you, what then?\nWith all my love,\nMother",
