Was probably one of the funniest things about the trip. At one we were presented with “if you buy in the next 10 minutes ______!” Followed by “but wait!, the first 3 people to sign up for this package will get free shipping!” followed by “if raise your hand to order in the next 10 seconds we will double the offer!” I was literally wheezing from laughing so hard in the middle of the sales pitch, which was probably incredibly rude but 🤷‍♂️. \n\n2) We toured Tiananmen Square where in 1989 troops killed a bunch of college student protestors. While we were walking on the sidewalk around it my dad asked the tour guide if this was where the protests happened. She got this look of horror on her face and very sharply told him to be quiet and that we couldn’t talk about that. Later when we were on the tour bus she explained that we were not allowed to talk about anything political, but that, yes, that is where the protests happened.

Reading all about how respectful and decent other countries are with far longer histories than the US, really puts American arrogance in perspective. There’s so much hate here. This “American democracy” is destined to end tragically. Just too much hate, ignorance, and complacency here. It’s sickening. \n\nDepending on who is in charge, you can hold back the tide but it just takes one asshole to trump (sorry) fuck everything up and create a situation that can not be fixed.

Next was the vending machines on the streets with everything from beer to used panties. \n\nWhile waiting for a train to take us into Hiroshima, I was flipping through some random magazine, that had to have been put together by a schitzo btw, and there in the center was porn. The people there are obsessed with porn. Anyways, we get to Hiroshima, which by the way, I thought would still have humming trees, looks completely normal. We of course have to see ground zero, let me tell you, the tangible hate was ever present. It seems led like the security guards were just itching for payback. They were rude and clearly racist fools. Oh that's another thing, older Japanese people are some of the most unabashed racists on the planet, hands down. They make my late grandpa seem mild in comparison. Anyways the museum is of course completely one sided, oh look what the evil Americans did, they burned children and elderly blah blah blah, should have worn a shirt with the A-bomb on it when I went. \n\nNext bizarre thing was these buildings made for karaoke weirdos. Not like American karaoke where a bunch of friends get drunk and butcher a popular song, no, these weirdos get off work, pay a fee, and walk into a little booth and just sing by themselves.\n\nLast but not least, the grown ass men who pay thousands a year to watch or interact with child girl bands. We stumbled into a bar somewhere in Iwakuni and there on stage had to be about 6, 12  year old girls dressed in skimpy clothes with about 150 40+ year old dudes absolutely loosing their shit over this girl band.

The taxi driver that took us from the airport to the resort was trying to get us upbeat but it was a little harrowing driving by crappy little shacks and emaciated people carrying bananas or whatever. When we got to the resort, of course it was heavily gated to prevent the locals from trespassing. The staff was all black and, as white people, it made us feel a little bit like we were guests of honor on a slave plantation, especially given the history of Jamaica since it was a slave colony. We ended up doing some research on the Jamaican economy in our hotel room and realized that a large chunk of the economy is based on these resorts, but that most of the money brought in leaves the country and goes to whatever parent company owns and operates them. Also, they’re making good beach land scarcer for the locals to enjoy.

I went there with a friend (two guys) and frankly, the Cuban people in Havana were the rudest, least helpful, and least trustworthy people I have ever met.\n\nThey will scam every single time they can get away with it: I negotiated a price with a taxi driver who, upon dropping us off, decided to charge us five times the price. There was a cop nearby, so I called him over. The cop took my money from the driver and they both drop away! \n\nNo petty crime? An acquaintance I hung out with had her phone stolen from her zipped up purse in a club within a few minutes of getting there. Two days prior, her friend also had her phone stolen in broad daylight. \n\nCat calling and misogyny was absolutely constant, it was like a national sport. Everywhere you go, there's a guy sitting on the sidewalk whistling at every single woman walking by! I was dancing in a platonic manner with two women friends whe and this guy (easily twenty years older than us) kept on trying to join the dance. After we all tell him nicely we're there to be only between us, he got upset and shouted to me that \"I was not allowed to have two women to myself and that I should give him the one I preferred the least.\" \n\nEvery single person who talks to you wants you to buy some random garbage they sell, like yesterday's paper (I kid you not on that one), and it'll be at a higher rate than the daily one.\n\nThey never have change and they will walk away never to be seen again when they say they'll leave for change.\n\nThey don't want to help, ever. The host of the Airbnb didn't know what there was to do in Havana! He didn't have a map of his city either. He'd lived there for forty years. It took me some long convincing to convince him to give me directions to the city center.\n\nTo clarify: I speak pretty good Spanish, traveled to thirty seven countries, staying both in cheap hostels or at hosts, both wealthy and very poor countries. I've met my fair share of rude and friendly people alike. Only in Cuba was the vibe this bad.",

The ice cream place I went to during a summer visit last year had the best I'd ever tasted which was mango and something else I can't remember.\n\nEverywhere here has contactless payment, even the public transport. Taking cash with you would be strange sometimes and you only really use it for food trucks.\n\nThe price of alcohol is just... So fucking cheap. A beer can be 9 crowns in Lidl. That's £0.30 / €0.35 / $0.43... And it's 500ml, not 330ml.

            "text": "To this day, possibly the most astounding things I encountered while traveling was Tokyo. \n\nAs an American, I’m used to thinking of travel as exploring “older” and often “less advanced” places. When I go to Central America I feel like I’m going from high sec to low sec space (that’s a term from EVE Online, kinda means like the difference between Coruscant and Mos Eisley. If you don’t know those google them and look at image search).  \n\nOr to put it in movie genres, when I travel it usually feels like traveling to an old western.  \n\nBut when I saw Tokyo, I realized I was visiting the future, not the past. Tokyo was like visiting Star Trek: The Next Generation. Technology did new and interesting things. Architecture was massive and otherworldly. Trains glide silently and arrive at the exact second they intend to. At the airport I was guided in my selection of a 3G-connected wifi router that fit in my pocket giving me internet access anywhere I went on my own phone. (This was a little over a decade ago so that wasn’t something I’d ever seen). Everything was constructed with remarkable precision.  \n\nAnd everything was *clean*. I didn’t see any dirt while I was in Tokyo. And I don’t mean like “there was no land not covered by concrete” I mean there was *no dirt*. There are no fingerprint smudges on windows. There are no oil stains on the road. There’s no darkened spot where a cooking vent has stained the concrete of the building next to it. It’s spotless. Tokyo is clean the way your mother in law’s dining room is clean on Thanksgiving before the guests arrive.  \n\nBut even all that wasn’t the most surprising thing. The most surprising thing was seeing the way people move on the sidewalk. All my life I have felt this kind of taut, springy readiness in my step to move around to make way and help position myself perfectly to let others flow around me. At the other end of the spectrum are the people who park their carts sideways in the aisle and don’t notice you approaching no matter how much you try to make noise so they notice, so you’re forced to initiate contact just to get to the damn pasta sauce that’s twenty feet away.  \n\nIn Tokyo everybody’s at the same end of the spectrum as me. It just felt like I was never the only one doing the spatially-aware maneuvering. Everybody is ultra polite and efficient in terms of seeing other people like a block away and flowing smoothly. There’s no conflict in this process, like there is on the sidewalks of Boston. Nobody’s trying to take space; everybody’s giving it. And they’re all really good at it.  \n\nThen when I landed back at O’Hare, it felt like landing at Guatemala City. I grew up in the rural midwest so an American airport to me has always seemed like a clean, efficient, technologically advanced place. But now it felt like I was emerging into the outskirts of civilization. Flies were buzzing around, noises clamored around uncontrolled. Trains squealed and hissed and clackety-clacked along like it was 1885. Sweaty people with belligerent or haggard looks on their faces stood about at random. Intercoms crackled and made inaudible announcements. Squeaky escalators ran on endlessly, in empty hallways with nobody riding them. Taxis with blacked exhaust pipes honked at each other.  \n\nI could almost hear caged full of chickens clucking all around me as I waited on the platform for the El to get back into town. A trip\nto Tokyo is like visiting the future.",

Outdoor drinking is becoming less taboo in the US, but is still not the norm compared to Japan.\n\n- A train that's on time? Sign me up. Fuck the blue line of WMATA.\n\n- How \"empty\" Tokyo can feel sometimes. I went many areas where despite being in one of the largest cities on Earth it was just my wife and I walking alone -- even in busy places like Harajuku. This has never happened in NYC, for example.\n\n- How little food variety there is. Obviously they had Japanese food in spades and it's million permutations, and it was awesome. But when it came to \"foreign\" food, there's just not a ton and it's usually subpar. Meanwhile, in the US, if I'm in a major city there's 100 different types of food. I can get authentic food from Yemen, Japan, Ethiopia, China (even different regions!), India, and many more. \n\nNetherlands:\n\n- Off the last thing. Similarly, the food was just not high in variety in comparison to the US. I was surprised. \n\n- Everyone fucking spoke English (in stark contrast to Japan). \n\n- Not a surprise to me, but it was for a co-worker: we saw very little to no drugs around (we were in The Hague). Apparently in his mind he thought the entire country would reek of weed and alcohol.\n\nEdit: to clarify, I was never able to visit Amsterdam. It was a work trip and we spent the whole time in one city, The Hague.\n\nAlso not all American cities have good food variety, but was comparing places like NYC to Tokyo and Atlanta/DC to The Hague. Also, part of my surprise in food was that growing up in the US I constantly heard \"oh haha, America has so little food variety and is a shithole where everyone eats burgers and slop.\" So I expected other countries to be this absolutely stellar eye opening experience: a wonderland of quality and variety I could only dream of.

They said, \"This is what we believe about history. It's different to what you're taught. We don't ask that you believe us, but please be respectful and listen to what we have to say.\" Fair enough. \n\n3) We actually had much more freedom to wander than I was told. I got to walk about the countryside for hours unescorted, talking with farmers etc. In the city, it was the same. I got punched by a high school kid during some rally. \n\n4) It was insanely fucking beautiful there. Like China but with no pollution or big buildings. The countryside was gorgeous. \n\n5) We got drunk with our guides and they were pretty open about stuff. \n\n6) Almost everyone was insanely chill. The people in the countryside were super friendly. Obviously the tourism people were all drilled on how to deal with foreigners, but there were tonnes of rural people who'd never seen a white face before. But they were nice and curious and decent. (I can speak some Korean, so I had some conversations.) Even the military and police and guards were willing to laugh and joke. When leaving the country, they're meant to check your phone and camera and bags. The guard asked me, \"Do you have any illegal stuff.\" \"Nope.\" \"Are you sure...?\" They seemed more interested in fucking around than checking. \n\n7) Whoever gets first class on internal flights is chosen by who runs fastest across the tarmac to the plane. I was wearing flip-flops unfortunately. \n\n8) The food sucked. That probably shouldn't have been a surprise given the starvation and all, but after South Korea I really thought it would be similar. It was more like \"Here's a potato. Enjoy.\" \n\n9) I bumped into Werner freakin' Herzog. That was a surprise! \n\n10) My guide was a pretty well-known dude who runs a lot of tours. He told me that basically most of the bullshit you read about N Korea in the papers comes from him joking around and people spreading those jokes as truth. He laid claim to the \"state-sanctioned haircuts\" thing and a few other high-profile stories that are hard to believe.",

My Opa and I are pale as can be aside from farmers tans, which I always assumed was the norm, however tanning is a big thing there. One of my cousins even has a tanning bed in her loft.\n\n• The prevalence of smoking (tobacco). I knew Europeans smoked a lot more than Americans but I had no idea how much more. The thing that shocked me most was the amount of places that sold cigarettes, specifically a bookstore I went to in a mall. Rolling one's own cigarettes is also much more common there.\n\n• Beer (and drinking in general) throughout the day, despite the time. Just went for a walk to the winkeltje? Biertje! A friend popped in to say hallo? How about a pilsje! Having a broodje? You better believe there's a beer right next to it. Not bad, just interesting.\n\n• This one is less concrete and more of an observation, but I noticed that among a certain age group (20s-40s) there's a fascination with English language music, specifically American and British/UK tunes. I remember hearing Billy Joel on the radio frequently. This could just be anecdotal though.\n\n• One last one and this is specifically about Dutch as a language, people love to make words diminutive. There's a lot of context involved, they all end in -je but depending on the word you need to put a letter before the -je. You'll see them in situations you'd expect like to describe something as cute (i.e. katje, konijntje), to express something being small or to only have one (i.e. jongetje, biertje, pilsje, broodje), but then sometimes they do it for no reason in particular, like winkeltje, vriendje, telefoontje, etc.\n\nA related aside, the Dutch share this trait with Australians, with words ending in -ie or -o for literally anything (i.e. servo, Eskie, tinnie, reggo, etc.). My Dad is Australian so I have an interesting cultural background.\n\nBut yeah, those were the things that stood out the most. I'll note that my family is from North and South Holland so these experiences may not be true of the rest of the country, as the provinciën are diverse and have their own cultures and quirks.\n\nEdit: one more that I just remembered, the sounds. I'm talking the sounds you may take for granted, like birds, cars, appliances, emergency vehicles, etc. When I woke up the first day I was there the birds *sounded wrong* and it was the strangest experience I've ever had. It never occurred to me that most of the bird species would be different. Some were very similar but sounded ever so slightly off, like the types of doves in North Holland compared to New England.",

The buildings, the coffees, the sandwiches (SERIOUSLY THOUGH, SUGAR IN THE BREAD? HONEY? SO CONFUSED.) but also the gestures. I met someone at the airport who drove THREE HOURS to pick me up just so I could crash on her couch.\n\n\\- The US hood is nothing compared the European 'hood'. I thought to myself, pffff how much worse could it be?! My god was I scared in some parts of Brooklyn. I met a big German guy, Arnold Schwarzenegger BIG, who said he literally almost shit his pants when he accidently found himself in the Bronx. It's insane man.\n\n\\- How much cheaper eating outdoors is. I thought to myself, hell no that's impossible. But no, fresh produce is SO expensive in the States. We cooked in our Hostel for a group of ten people, a cheap pasta and I STILL spent more than I would've spent eating out in a modest restaurant.\n\n\\- I was baffled how many Americans have never even left their state. In Chicago I met a group of Cubs fans (who took me along to a game, thanks for being my friends guys <3) who were all late 20's early 30's and this was their first time outside of their state. I think they were from Ohio. Met so many more people who had never left the states.\n\n\\- How NICE New Yorkers are. I arrived by bus, in Hell's Kitchen, during 6 o' clock rush hour with a big backpack and let me tell you, I nearly had a panic attack. I needed a freaking metro ticket but the machine didn't accept my creditcard. Again, I was scared SHITLESS, thinking I was sure I was gonna get robbed. This guy walks by, coffee in hand, super busy, in a suit that cost more than my freaking house and I think he was barely older than I was. He looks at me, stops and just says \"Hey man. Are you alright? Do you know where you need to go?\" He offered to pay for my subway ticket, but I declined, then walked me to the cabstands, TRIED TO OFFER ME MONEY FOR THE CAB and when I was in, waved and went on his way. Then I told the cabby I needed to go to Brooklyn and he REFUSED BECAUSE IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR ME?! I told him my creditcard didn't work, THEN HE OFFERED TO PAY FOR MY SUBWAY TICKET?! I told him no-no I got cash, please just take me and when we entered Brooklyn, he refused to take a tip.\n\nMy god people, New Yorkers are the best.",

People didn’t seem to be in a rush for anything, and while I’m sure they have their problems as well, there was much more “centeredness” across the country. People were much more focused on what was happening right now and what was in front of them. This was in 2008 though, so before the explosion of smart phones and social media",

I didn't think much of it, I mean we have Thanksgiving in the U.S. so I just assumed it was a big lunch. No.\n\nNo. We have nothing like this in the U.S. Julefrokost is on an entirely different level.\n\nYou see, it's a *lunch* only in name. What it really is, is sitting down at about noon, and not getting up from your seat again until midnight or later. The food never stops coming. The schnapps never stop coming. It's course after course after course and the Danes can drink you under the table any day, so combine that with strong liquor over a 12 hour stretch and you are likely to die.\n\nMy first julefrokost, I sat across from my husband's uncle, who kept my shot glass full the entire day. I was drunk by 2pm and full to the point of bursting at 3pm. I have never been so sick as I was the day after my first julefrokost.",

The Spanish colonized Peru, and that's the sort of thing the Spanish built, big churches. \n\nThe history of some of these churches was pretty interesting too-- I got to go down below one of them where there are some old catacombs full of bones. When the Spanish first conquered the region, they built churches directly over several sites where the Inca buried their dead, and to be buried under the church was highly desirable. I saw hundreds of human skeletons down there, arranged in different ways. Rows of skulls, rows of femurs, finger bones, everything grouped together by body-part. \n\nLima was also a crazy city. Parts of it look just like any large city, with tall office buildings, shopping malls, heavy traffic-- but then just a short bus-ride away, there's a stone pyramid being excavated. I also liked how much public space there was, and how many people were lined up in the parks with paints and easels and canvases, selling their art. That was fun to see. If you go there, you should try the ceviche. The ceviche was excellent. \n\nSome neighborhoods looked pretty favela-like, but less crowded and pretty clean. The roofs on all the houses are also flat there because it never rains in Lima, pretty much ever. It's sort of on the edge of the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places in the world. The only precipitation the city gets comes from ocean fog from the coast, and they get all their water from the mountains. I guess the Andes must produce an extreme, EXTREME rain-shadow effect. It rains so little, the streets don't even have gutters or drains. There's just a shallow depression near the curb that the trash gets swept into. \n\nThe Sacred Valley in Peru was one of the most beautiful places I've ever been, and has some of the steepest cliffs I've ever seen. And yet, at the top of some of these cliffs, you can see some old stone granaries that the Incas built, with no mortar, to store their harvest.",

The farmers had a sense of community that felt like something very lost on us. Household estates were intergenerational and people were constantly interacting and helping each other with chores. Work life was really full, but the people seemed satisfied and genuinely happy. Like in the region I was in, people just sang while they worked and did things.

            "text": "Oh, I've got a story for this. Strap in, it's a long one. \n\nAfter I graduated university, I went to Paris. I'm a twin, so up until this point in my life, I had pretty much never truly been alone.  Thinking this wouldn't be a big deal, I got on the plane with a bunch of paper maps and some written directions to a hostel (it was fifteen years ago, and I didn't have a smartphone).\n\nWhen I got to Charles de Gaulle airport, I stepped off the plane and had this sudden, stomach cramping realization: I was alone, an ocean away from everyone I knew. I had an urge to scramble back onto the plane and hide in the bathrooms. \n\nBut I rallied my courage and kept walking, clutching my folded paper instructions like a talisman. The first step was to find Train C. It's the same in French as it is in English, so I figured it was doable. I spot the information desk and approach.\n\n\"Bonjour...\"\n\nThe man behind the desk doesn't even look up from his book.\n\nI clear my throat and try again. \"Bonjour!\"\n\nHe turns away from me, leaning deeper into his book.\n\nI'm not sure how to escalate from here. I've never been outright ignored by an adult before. As I'm trying to work up the courage to try out some of my garbled highschool french, I spot some businessmen moving fast. Like they've got some place to be, fast. I figure they're going downtown, and this information desk thing is a lost cause, so I haul my oversized bag after them.\n\nThey lead me down to the platform for Train C, just as I'd hoped, which is a sleek grey and white walkway with dark coal beds under the tracks. I just miss the doors as they slide shut, and I'm left on an empty platform. This is when it all really catches up to me. I'm alone. In Paris. No one understands my French and I could barely find the train platform. I crumple my instructions in my hand and feel my cheeks flush. My breath is coming in short and there's a ringing in my ears. I'm about to have a full blown panic attack.\n\nBut then, in the midst of it all, I heard singing. Loud, raucous singing. \n\nI turn. An older woman is walking down the platform. She's wearing a flowing skirt and a headwrap. And she's singing. At me. I abruptly forget that I'm having a panic attack and watch as she approaches.\n\nHer face is weathered but creased with laughter. She breaks her song to say something to me in a language that isn't French. Romanian, maybe? I don't have time to wonder because she's backing towards the edge of the platform. I reach out a hand because I think she is going to fall, and she's so close I almost catch her stained sweater.\n\nThen, as she grins at me with her remaining teeth, she pulls down her skirt and shits onto the coal bed.\n\nI'm so shocked I start to laugh. She laughs with me as I back away and I can hear some French dude who has just joined us on the platform shout, \"Oh mon Dieu!\" I hear the soft *pat-pat* of her business on the coal and she says something to me again. I'm shaking my head and laughing as she picks up her drawers, and wanders away. \n\nThe train pulled up. I got on, bursting with the need to tell someone, anyone what I just saw. But my highschool french just didn't cut it. I literally didn't have the words. \n\nSo the most surprising thing that happened to me in France happened the first half an hour I was there. After that? I was fine. No panic attacks, no homesickness. Just a wary eye for train poopers.",

How polite, kind, and patient the people were to us foreigners who needed help. We were worried y'all  Scotts and Brits were rude and stuck up. But it was the complete opposite. We got mistaken as an EF group that was causing trouble and when we explained ourselves the guard IMMEDIATELY apologized. My Mom and I were running a bit late in York and had to figure out the quickest way back and like 8 people offered to lead us to where we needed to go and gave directions. And another time my Mom ran late going back to the bus because the cashier was explaining the currency while giving change! I certainly wasn't expecting that from the country that my grandfather got pickpocketed at within minutes of exiting his plane. But y'all excelled at it! \n\n2. Us Americans are taught that we're a melting pot but you never see it on our tv shows. In the UK however I truly saw all sorts of races, ethnicities, religions, and even people with disabilities all represented on tv. And that was in the little time I spent watching it.\n\n3. The soda's tasted very different from the ones in America. Like they'd be the same brand soda but it tasted flat or diet. It wasn't until I got to a Five Guys that I got a taste of what soda from home tasted like. \n\n4. How late it gets before the sun finally sets. It was freakin 11:00 pm before it set one night I was there! I couldn't believe my eyes! \n\n5. All the things y'all can get away with on basic tv. I mean I saw Deadpool completely uncensored and saw at least 8 uncensored penises and pairs of breasts on UK tv. America censors 90% of the language in Deadpool and we certainly don't show nudity without censoring it unless its on like HBO or another premium movie network.

The rest has speed limits either because it's in an urban area so is limited to reduce emissions and noise, or it's an older autobahn often with narrower lanes or hard shoulders or its in a mountainous area or nearing a key interchange or there's roadworks.\n\nAlso, the law states that 130kmh (81mph) is the max advised.

Like, I’ve been to many more ‘classic’ tourist places where you can find these sellers, but this was just INSANE and tbh really scary too. It ruined the whole experience. \n\nAdding to that, taking a taxi there if you’re a tourist can be very nice, but very scary too. they notice you are a tourist and know you are going to see the pyramids. This taxi driver just DID NOT want to bring us to the location directly but insisted on driving a totally different route “to see his cousin who has a camel farm” or whatever. Tbh it almost felt like abducting tourists and if it wasnt for my boyfriend studying Arabic there and yelling and cursing at him in his own language, freaking him out, god knows where he would have taken us, or any other tourist before and after us.",

Angry people and armed police/soldiers everywhere. A tiny taste of the racism other people put up with all their life. My journey back to Tel Aviv airport was an adventure in itself (ask if interested, I made my life both more difficult and easier all at the same time).\n\nI would not hesitate to visit Jerusalem again.

What I found very interesting was the fact that even though the roads were similar and the types of vehicles were similar (tuk tuks, motor bikes, and small cars), the cars in India were a lot more beat up than in Sri Lanka. It was the same sort of noisy chaos in both countries, but the Sri Lankans seemed to be more orderly and more careful not to crash than in India. The food was just unreal in both places, but that was no surprise and was why we went there.",

Then on the way back to the border with Russia, there was a statute of two hands caring for a lamb, I could not take a photo of that beautiful thing because it showed up suddenly on a curvy mountain road. Later I learnt that their old pagan religion had so many animal welfare provisions. 'Abkhazians are well aware of the negative and degrading nature of this term, thus the vast majority of Abkhazians refuse to label themselves as pagans. It is instead listed as the national monotheistic religion of Abkhazia, or faith of Abkhazia. Today, only approximately 5-7% of Abkhazians list themselves as followers of this religion, but nevertheless, the religion still has strong cultural influences on the modern Abkhaz people and state.'\nThe most important of the other Gods include Afy, who rules the thunder and the weather, and Ayerg and Azhvepshaa, who are the spirits of the forest, wild animals, and hunting.

Coming back home to NJ and going out to eat or drink was just disappointing. I don’t understand why we don’t have outdoor drinking and dining like Europe.  \n\nThe pandemic kind of gave me what I want by encouraging more outdoor activities/dining in the US but I know that will largely go away once COVID is finally done. A lot of towns in New Jersey have shut down main roads near where I live so restaurants can use the space. I hope they just keep doing that.

            "text": "India.  This was about 2 years ago.  Thought I knew a bit about what I was getting into - read the tourist brochures, watched some do’s and don’t’s.  Large cities were pretty much as expected, but I came for a religious Buddhist pilgrimage, which took me around the countryside.  And countryside India was...unexpected.  I’m not talking about the sheer disregard/disrepair of some places of worship (though that’s bad in it’s own way), but the things that weren’t mentioned in the materials I read.\n\nLet’s start with cows.  Or more specifically, the smell of cow dung. You couldn’t get away from it because it was used for everything.  They’d even have drying fields of them.  They were used for coating houses and as fuel for cooking.  Finding food that wasn’t soaked in the smell was trying when you weren’t in a big city.\n\nNext, the caste system.  We went to a mall.  They checked for caste and wouldn’t let some people below a certain caste in.  One of the women that weren’t allowed in had to ask us to buy stuff for her and promised to pay us for them. I knew India had a caste system.  I just didn’t think it was still so prominent.\n\nOne of the rivers we saw had large concrete pillars where the deceased would get ‘cremated’. Except they were barely set ablaze, their skin only just charred, before they were pushed off the pillar into the water to float downstream.  Ok, maybe it was a local custom.  But then barely half a mile downstream, was a ‘waste disposal’ site.  I say waste disposal, but it was just a dump where the trash was piled up and bits of it would occasionally get carried away by the current. Not only just trash, but bodily waste as well.  Unsanitary and disrespectful of the dead, I think, but hey, it’s a different country.  Then just a little more downstream was a group of people playing, washing clothes, bathing, and scooping up water to bring home.  One of the teens just pushed a corpse further into the middle of the river when it bumped into him and continued horsing around with his friend.\n\nPerhaps the most horrific - the beggars’ way of begging.  And this would happen even more in touristy places.  Because people are more softhearted towards mothers and small children, said beggars would purposely get pregnant and birth babies just so tourists would give more money to them.  Some of the mothers I saw were children themselves.  One particularly memorable mother was only 13 - I thought they were siblings at first.\n\nNot to say that there weren’t good things that amazed me, but I kinda already expected them.  And these jumped out at me because the brochures and stuff I pre-read didn’t mention them.  Probably the only reason I came across them was because our group didn’t follow a lot of the tourist paths.\n\nWell. I suppose one unexpected good experience was in two of the rural night trains we took:  they had hammocks instead of seats for the customers!  Four in a car, two on each side.  One on top of the other with metal ladders on the wall like a strange bunk bed.  The car was shaking heavily was it ran on the tracks but we couldn’t really feel the shaking at all!  It was amazing!",

Slovenia is one of the most beautiful countries I've seen! The architecture is a mixture of Swiss-style gentility and Italian-Mediterranean coolness with the occasional medieval fortress. The countryside is lush, green and pretty. The (small) coastline has some lovely swimmable sea with abundant sealife. The capital, Ljubljana, is a great mix of proud Austro-Hungarian splendor and cool university town. \n\nI don't even work for the Slovenian tourist board or anything.

They suffer over half of the world's confirmed cluster munitions casualties. Since 1973, 20,000 casualties have been reported. 60% of them result in death, and 40% of the victims are children. Farmers know their fields are polluted and continue to till the ground because they can't afford to relocate. Some of the lower class salvage metal to try to put food on the table furthering their chances of being injured by UXO. The government focuses their clearance efforts in populated areas and agricultural grounds, but the sheer number of UXO is overwhelming not to mention heavy rains, monsoons, floods, and landslides that move and unearth the munitions.\n\nSo what surprises me? The hindrance of the country's progress by UXO. Also the people still hiding in the mountains in fear that the war is still happening, but ultimately they're not wrong.

I come from South Africa where you're regularly hassled for money or food. We even have 'car guards' who look supposedly look after your car while it is parked, and appear at your side when you return to your parked car asking for a fee but mysteriously disappear when something does go wrong. We also have a culture of people who are constantly looking for handouts, whether it's begging on the street, relying on food banks or dependent on some form of government grant. Visiting the Philippines, which is just as much a third world country as we are, I saw none of this. Admittedly I was in the tourist areas as opposed to the inner city regions which might be a contributing factor to what I experienced but the levels and forms of poverty are similar. What impressed me was that everybody in the Philippines, even those living in remote areas seemed to have some form of shop or home industry going on. The kids seemed enthusiastic about their schooling, the schools were brightly decorated with flags and there was nobody asking me for a handout on every corner. People seemed industrious by nature. The other pleasant aspect was the lack of crime, especially pickpocketing and feeling that you had to constantly look over your shoulder the whole time. It was so refreshing and made me realize just how many problems my own country has in terms of its handout mindset.",

First day in the country we go to Tim Hortons and after being on the road for 7 hours my first priority is emptying my bladder, which at this point had become a volumetric paradox. \n\nSo there I was standing at the first of three empty urinals when a guy comes in and goes to the urinal beside me. I was a little uneasy at the blatant breach of social etiquette I once believed to be universal. I just figured things were different here. But then the unthinkable happens. The guy leans over and says, “is it weird?” With the same level of nonchalance one would have discussing the weather at a bus stop. \n\nI look up and briefly notice the man looking directly at me before I return to studying the unintentionally hilarious advert for grilled paninis. I’m not usually a fan of casual conversation with strangers whilst holding our dicks. But I’m also not typically one for being rude, especially in a foreign land. \n\nI say, “Is what weird? I mean other than this conversation given the context.”\n\nThe man replies, slowly going into a whisper, “Is it weird? You know…all the white people?” \n\nHe says this while trying in vain to shake out every last drop without breaking his attention from our conversation. I am now thoroughly confused and beginning to question my decision to move here. I slowly button my pants and move to wash my hands without making direct eye contact. As I’m doing this, the guy walks up and puts a hand on my shoulder and says, “Sorry. I’m only joking. Not about the white people part though. There’s lots of em up here. I saw your license plate when you pulled up. Welcome to the Great White North.” And then he left. \n\n\nI continued washing my hands in mild shock and confusion and becoming more and more aware where he put his unwashed hand after handling his junk. All things considered though, that was definitely the friendliest interaction I’ve ever had in a men’s room. That was the first Canadian I met there. I was surprised they were so friendly that this man was willing to transgress and ancient binding agreement between all men just to be the first to welcome me into the country.

First of all, as long as you’re intelligent and have something worthwhile to say, you can drift around talking to anyone regardless of gender, age or gap in attractiveness. More importantly, I had more great conversation in my first night out there than a year combined in LA. In Los Angeles (and many cities in the US), it’s basically like a girl will ignore you at the bar if she’s not physically attracted to you (and convo is generally weak even if they are) and men who are strangers mostly don’t interact unless it’s to glare or talk shit.\n\nMy favorite ever first visit and still favorite foreign destination: Japan. It was everything I expected and so much more. Before COVID hit, my gf and I were in the process of planning a long term stay (which can be complex if you want to qualify to rent an actual residence and not just a vacation rental).

One night we passed one of our customers in the street and she invited us to her apartment for coffee. She lived with her husband, children and mother in a small apartment building and told us how during the war they had to close off most of the house and just live in the living room as they could afford to heat the entire apartment. She kept bringing out food and drink for us until the table was laden (and didn't stop even when we said really there is too much food here already!) which I have heard is a very Armenian trait. I would say Armenian people have just cause to be very stand offish given how the rest of the world has treated their country but I honestly think of the 80 countries I've been to that is in the top of my list for most welcoming people.",

You feel like you're in America then someone says \"house\", \"out\", or \"about\", then you're jarred back to reality.\n\nZurich, Switzerland - How weirdly clean it was. It looks like Disneyland. It was the first time I've ever been to Europe so that was my first impression.

I am American though so \"indoor voice\" is relative.\n  \nCape Town, South Africa - Once again, many surprises, but it was the only place I've been where the people know they have problems, and have no idea how to fix them.

I can tell because it's about three times the size of the Ikea right next to it. The dairy section of that store is about the size of a 7-11.

It opened my eyes that the situation had been so vastly misrepresented in the western media, and that I was not told so many things about how the IDF controlled every inch of Palestine. \n\nFrom my understand before, as a born and raised American watching and reading American mass media, I was led to believe they were separate countries with separate governments that disagreed with each other over land rights. In reality, one country controlled everything and the other was practically invisible. Just to get across Palestinian cities with settlers, you need to go through multiple IDF armed checkpoints, through chain-link fences, with machine guns pointed down the line of people standing single file. There are usually spent shell casings around these checkpoints too. The IDF checks your papers and ID at these checkpoints, not any Palestinian authority. Again, the Israeli Defense Force needs to check your papers when crossing between parts of cities in Palestine. And that's not even close to the most oppressive way the IDF makes its presence known.\n\nTake Hebron, for example, the Palestinian city just south of Bethlehem. American media had never told me that there were racially segregated streets imposed by the IDF, some streets were reserved only for settlers, others only for Palestinians. \n\nSettlers are free to go into the crowded Palestinian streets if they want to, but Palestinians will be arrested for walking into the near-empty settler-only streets. Settlers lived in the same buildings as Palestinians, just above them with the stairs between the 1st and 2nd floors cemented or bricked up. Settler families lived directly above Palestinian families in apartment buildings and would never meet them. Furthermore, there's a cage over the Palestinian streets up to the first floor, so settlers living on floors above can look outside and see the sky unobstructed while Palestinians below look up and see cage (and usually garbage [the settlers have dumped on the cage](https://observers.france24.com/en/20100910-hebron-palestinian-shopkeepers-are-drowning-rubbish-israeli-settlers) as an insult to the Palestinians).\n\nAgain, this is in the West Bank, supposedly the \"sovereign nation of Palestine\". What a joke, Palestine is as much a country as the Warsaw Ghettos were a country. The West Bank is a giant ghetto where people are harassed, intimidated, humiliated, and sometimes killed by technically foreign soldiers patrolling their streets, looking for fights.\n\nI didn't go to Gaza, but from everyone I talked to who had been to both, they said Gaza is way worse than anything I saw in the West Bank and I easily believe that.",

(Even cities reputed to have good public transport it was often pretty basic. A few places have reasonably decent public transport)\n\n- The difficulty of getting decent coffee, tea, cheese, beer, or even fresh fruit and vegetables in many places.

[By comparison, in my quiet little suburb, there are are at least 8 places to buy decent coffee that are a short walk from my home. If I was in a hotel in or near the city it would be well into the dozens.]\n\n- The trouble I had making myself understood in some parts. In a few places, *even spelling my name* was no good - I had to pull out ID for them to be able to understand what my name was in order to check in.

I still remembered Moscow and how little advertising they had on the whole (at least compared to other big cities in Europe) and assumed as a nominally communist country it would be somewhat similar there or perhaps a bit worse. When I entered the metro in Beijing for the first time and they started projecting ads onto the tunnel walls while the train was driving something in me just kinda died. I stared at it for a good minute or so just thinking \"if this is what the future looks like I don't want it\" The sheer audacity of using the \"view\" of the windows as ad space simply was too much for me to comprehend. After that even Japan's  rather agressive advertising inside the metro seemed tame.\n\n Other than that I was surprised at how little English they actually spoke in China. I was in a queue with hundreds of people and many were interested in me apparently being elderly Chinese tourists from the countryside who hadn't seen a lot of Europeans in their lifetime. I tried a bit of conversation in rudimentary Mandarin (which didn't go very far) but when I wanted to ask a few questions beyond the scope of my mandarin and went for English, French and Japanese nobody really seemed to understand me. The only people who spoke English during my visit in Beijing were an American businessman (big surprise there), soldiers, police officers and airport staff. In Shanghai there was also a few receptionists and a shop owner later on. \n\nAnother somewhat unsettling part of Beijing was the great eastern ring road and it's buildings. When I took a cab from the airport to Tiananmen (I only had about a day) there were these huge buildings. To me they seemed the height of small skyscrapers but weirdly enough longer than high. The sheer size of the buildings was insane there. I felt like every city I had been to previously was dwarfed in comparison. This was soon to be surpassed by my impressions in Tokyo but I'll never forget this eerie feeling that actually that whole Chinese propaganda had a point to it looking at this huge city that seemed so unexpectedly modern in parts. Shanghai felt much the same, although less foreign in a way. The skyscrapers there and many of it's buildings in Pudong could just as well have been built in a different metropolis, whereas the absurd grandure of Beijing's representative buildings seemed far more foreign and unique to the city.",

I love near NYC and there's a lot of people in the city, but it's on a whole other level in Beijing. It was during a national holiday and just the amount of people is daunting as hell. Took the subway as often as I could because one time we took a car somewhere and it was 2 hours to go roughly 4 miles. Just so many people and cars. We wanted to get out and walk and our hosts suggested to not to do that so we tried to be polite about it. I've never been in traffic so bad that we literally were at one stop light for about 20 minutes.\n\nPeople were beyond friendly to us though. On my free afternoons I would go to some recommended neighborhoods and local folks were more than happy to talk about their families, share some food, and just generally chat in what little broken Mandarin I have and their admittedly better English. Some folks there have lived in generational houses that they have been there longer than the entirety of the United States' history. It's wild. \n\nIt was also the safest I have ever felt in a city. I know China has some pretty harsh penalties for things, and it was a national holiday, but the amount of just guards hanging around and doing things was incredible. I feel comfortable in New York but as a foreigner in a different country? I was downright comfy.\n\nChina at large is pretty beautiful too. We did some traveling through Henan province and I was just awestruck by the architecture and the geography. Literally saw the Lonely Mountain. It was breathtaking.

When we flew in for some reason we landed in Haiti I think, and we had to drive about an hour to get to the resort. The country was completely sad and poor looking, we drove by people living in the woods with stick houses, people walked around the city barefoot. It was so sad, and when we got to the resort it was everything the advertisement said it would be, like going from gray to full color by just walking through the resort's gate. I was young so I had no idea, but it was a huge wake up call for me that I was extremely privileged and staying in a big beautiful resort while people who lived in that country barely had roofs over their heads.

Every American knows the same item can have a much different price in every state.\n\nThe toilets were odd to me because there didn’t seem to be a consistency in the designs. In America there is a mostly standard bowl design. It varies some but usually not far. The stalls were usually sealed also. I’ve heard people from other countries mention American bathroom stalls. Why can’t we have the same privacy?\n\nThere was also the price of soft drinks. In America sodas are dirt cheap. At the time I went a canned Coke was 4,50 Euros. At the time the exchange rate was about $1.75 to 1Euro. I also had to get used to the fact that they didn’t use ice in restaurants.\n\nAnother thing that fascinated me was a grocery store we went to. It was totally inconspicuous. The top level was a department store. Then you go down a stairwell and there’s an entire grocery store under it. If you didn’t know it was down there you wouldn’t even realize it from looking at the outside. Grocery stores here are typically large and VERY conspicuous.

One other thing that bothered me in Venice: I hardly could find a place to sit down and rest a little bit. No benches, no public (free) options to sit down. It's forbidden to sit on stairs or bridges. They literally want you to sit down on chairs in a café or restaurant. And of course you will have to buy drinks and food then.

            "text": "I’ve been in the fortunate position to travel a ton and maybe there most surprising has been Asia, specifically China. \n\nPerhaps the creamiest thing about China is just how *normal* it feels initially. Everyone knows that China has a super provocative gov’t with some really oppressive laws and zero OSHA standards and really shoddy infrastructure. But upon first review? China seems super modern and western. Big skyscrapers everywhere, McDonald’s and Starbucks everywhere you turn, big shopping malls with their same stores you’d see in any mall in America, tons of SUVs and other larger cars you might not expect to see outside of the US or Canada, etc. It was just so normal. \n\nBut then after you spend some time there you start to see the weird stuff. \n\nThere’s zero safety net. China might have w “communist” government, but their system is capitalism to the extreme. There is zero social safety net. Of you are poor you are poor, you will not get money from the gov’t or any help. Healthcare is not free (not expensive tbh but what is considered expensive is relative in a country with a median income of ~$4,278 USD but a GDP per capita of ~$10,000 USD.) Mooney is king in China and those with it will do what they can to flaunt it, and those without it will do what they can to get out. \n\nDespite there being no safety net, tho, there’s *no* homeless people. I spent at year in China, mostly in Dalian, and I saw one homeless person and zero beggars. This surprised me considering the aforementioned lack of a social safety net and the fact there aren’t any homeless shelters. When I asked about this in was typical told that there just aren’t homeless people in China, everyone has a home, but one university employee told me that the gov’t takes away homeless people from the cities and either uses them as laborers or takes them “elsewhere”. I don’t know what this means exactly but it was pretty surprising. \n\nAnother thing that was surprising, tho much less intense, is the number of American celebrities in Chinese commercials. NBA players, pop singers, etc on CCTV advertising some random Chinese brands. Like I never writing guessed that Steph Curry or Ariana Grande are making so much money in that market but I guess it makes sense. \n\nThe last thing I’ll say that was so surprising is how hands off the people are from the gov’t. In the west most of us are democracies so we’re used to being at least minimally involved with the gov’t and you can even easily schedule tours of major gov’t buildings and call, email, or write representatives and even hear back sometimes. In China the gov’t seems like a completely different entirety from the people. Most people just don’t care, they have a passive interest, but most just have a blind trust in it because, in all reality, China is in a much better position today than it has been at any point in the past. People remember the famines and unrest and wars and all of the crazy things that have happened in the country’s past and are just happy that today most people have food and water and things are still getting better every day. They could care less about the Uyghurs or Chinese aggression in them South China Sea, they just trust that their gov’t is doing trust our needs to do. Plus, why stress? They can’t do anything about it anyway. At most, 6% of the population are members of the CCP, only about 90 million of 1.4+ billion. This 6%makes the decisions for the rest of everybody and everyone seems to have developed the “why bother” approach. It was really interesting.",

Amazing food. But the thing that stood out the most to me seeing as I'm American..... People walk in front of moving vehicles like it's nothing. We had a tour guide and he had to keep slamming the breaks because literally everyone and their cousins would walk in front of cars going 40ish 50 on main roads. I was baffled. At one point we about sent someone flying 10ft through the air. Anyways besides that weird aspect, it was overall a very beautiful experience and I never thought Cuba would be my favorite place to travel. I also want to mention, for a communist country they had nothing but love for the Americans. Was a very sad situation for the people though.",

We'd get people either praising our government for locking up the evil bastard or being angry with us because they though he was a saint. (He did a lot of evil shit to a lot of people, but some of the things he did were good for some.)\n\nThere were shrines (I assume to Catholic saints or Mary... or something) all a long the roads, each one surrounded by little haloes of glass. The lorry drivers threw nearly empty bottles of spirits at the shrines for luck.\n\nLot of poverty too especially from a fairly sheltered background as my own. Even the \"rich\" places were often an order of magnitude poorer than I expected.\n\nSo much beauty though, from seeing the shadows of the Andes spreading across the land as we came into land at Santiago. Of the jungle clad mountains as we navigated the road between Santiago and Region XI (Coyhaquie).

Over there cleaners come every night to clean garbage..so everyone just throws evrrything on ths floor. There are no garbage cans either usually. This was 4 5 years ago in Changchun China.

            "text": "Just traveling in general, I found the randomness of meeting people as an American to be a fun experience. For example, I went to Budapest in 2005 for vacation from my job in Baghdad, and it was extremely fun to get lost in a city where the language is so different, and yet Hungarians, once you get past the initial scowl, and they hear you speak English, turn into some of the most fun and welcoming people I've ever been around.\n\nThen, to add more spice to the vacation, I ran into a group of lost British men, a gang of about 20 skittles players from Somerset, and hung out with them for a couple of days; the first 5 hours I spent with them, we went from bar to bar, and then a handful of them wanted to take a nap before we went out \"drinking\". So down into the hotel's grotto some of us went for a meal, and the discussions around the table, while all of us were half in the bag, were fun, philosophical, and deeper than any discussions I've ever had inebriated in America. Like, discussions of God, politics of the world, and philosophy, all while one was barely able to keep his face an inch above the tablecloth. By the time that night was done, it was only me and the guy in his mid-60s named Bob, and we ended up in a communist bar. Like old Soviet propaganda painted on the walls, busts of Stalin and Lenin over the bar... Good times...\n\nI tell people all the time to travel, especially to places that seem off the beaten path for Americans. There's too much awesome stuff in this world, and too many people's stories that need to be told and heard, to just sit back in Middle America and think you know it all. I've met militant Buddhists in Thailand, eaten kebabs at a border crossing in a valleyful of mines in Iraq, I've take pictures with a Taliban monkey in Pakistan, and I've even seen a holy bomb outside of Valletta, Malta. I've seen amazing things, from hanging out on a bar on the 67th floor of a high-rise in Bangkok, to a quiet Christian Church hidden away in a cave in Mount Gellert in the middle of Budapest. I've seen the 100-ton gun in Malta, and accidentally managed to see a market day in Bari Imam, outside of Islamabad, Pakistan, where the most random thing I've ever had happen, what was probably the happiest dude in Pakistan that day, slapping the hood of my car, and then just dancing in the street without a care in the world. I've been to the countries we've waged war with, and talked to the people directly, and while the stories may be flavored differently, they all have a lot of common things. There's more that binds us to this little blue marble than separates us, but we need to listen to each other to see it.",

In the US, ppl will yell at you if you let your dog out on your driveway without a leash. And inside a restaurant? Ppl’s heads would implode and Karens would flock. \n\n2. The difference in recycling- never saw plastic bags at grocery stores, and you have to pay a few pents for each paper bag you use from a grocery store. In the US, most ppl use plastic bags like their candy- No charge. \n\n3. My mail came through a little hole in my front door rather than me going to get my mail from a mailbox down the street. \n\n4. The playgrounds, especially kid swings, are very different. I had two young children who used the park often, and the “baby swings” are structured entirely differently than parks in the USA. I would just suggest googling pics instead of me explaining the differences with my 5yr old brain.\n\n5. For the love of God, LEMONADE. It took me about a month to realize that pubs and restaurants weren’t getting my order wrong every time... if you say you want lemonade, you get sprite. On that note, a shandy(topping your beer off with this said lemonade) is practically unheard of in the USA, and if you order it you’ll get some weird looks. \n\n6. Mayonnaise is the UK’s ketchup. I’m now obsessed, but always get confused and, sometimes, grossed-out looks when I use mayonnaise as my condiment of choice. \n\nThere’s a lot more, but those are the ones off the top of my head...",

To reach our hotel which was in roughly the middle of Tokyo (Shibuya specifically). Tokyo is so big it takes an hour driving at 60+ mph through a city that puts Manhattan to shame just to reach the center.

The HS where I come from, you never want to leave your valuables unattended such as a phone, money, whatever, otherwise it belongs to someone else. Well in Germany I noticed all the German students I was with would leave their valuables in their break room and just leave it for the next class. No one was going to steal it, so it struck me as odd, because i've always grown up bringing my valuables always with me and out of sight, but here? Nah forget it, it's safe! \n\nAlso, when taking public transportation like trains, I never once saw a train conductor, everyone followed the rules and bought their ticket at the kiosk thing at the train station, held onto it for their trip and that was it. Me being from Chicago and taking the Metra multiple times, I can promise you that if the Metra followed the same principle as the train stations did that I visited in Germany, such as not seeing a train conductor and buying your ticket at a kiosk, A LOT of people would just see it as a free train ride. I guess in Germany if you get caught on a train without a ticket it leads to a pretty heavy fine. \n\nThis was all just an observation that I experienced my 4 times visiting Germany, of course it isn't going to be the same for everyone!",

I never felt intimidated when police were around, they were incredibly friendly and approachable, and every interaction I had was entirely positive. The police there clearly have the objective of providing a community service, and aren’t trying to ‘get you.’ They don’t sit and radar to ticket people for small traffic infractions. Instead, when citizens witness unsafe driving - its very normal to call the police and inform them. This happened to me on the South Island once (was the passenger when the call happened and had switched to driving by the time the police officer found us). The officer was friendly and professional - explained her experience with accidents on this road and why it can be dangerous, and then gave us some advice on a shortcut to our destination, where we can get a good nights sleep, etc. When I came back to America and came across a couple armed police officers, it shocked me how they seemingly had this bubble around them, where people would avoid them, and just generally how they carried themselves.",

What was remarkable was that I also observed rampant racism in those countries that most Europeans seemed to be completely blind to.  I realized then that this had a lot to do with how powerful free speech is in America, the power of American media to shape views overseas, and that America is remarkably heterogeneous compared to most of Europe.  Although Europe had many issues with equality and race, the affected populations were small by comparison, and had little to no voice in those countries, so it wasn’t an issue that was front and center in people’s minds.\n\nI’m sure that this is too much of a generalization (my anecdotal evidence surely is not a reliable representation), and surely things have changed in 20+ years.  But what was important to me is that the experience really helped develop my perspective on race issues, and the power of dissent, in America.  I realized that progress in America, now and in the past, has only come with uncomfortable (and sometimes painful) growth.  Despite all the issues that America has with systemic bias and racism, I was proud that there were many in our country who were vocal in confronting the problem.  What many saw as discord and weakness, I began to see as power, and the strength of American democracy.\n\nI often reflect on those feelings now, when I look at how divided America has become since then.  I question whether I still feel the same about the strength of our democracy.  But that is probably a topic for another conversation.",

You always have to ask the server if something contains any dairy or egg or is fried in the same oil as meat, and half the time they (understandably) have no idea so they have to go ask someone in the kitchen. \n\nThroughout Ireland, every place we ate at had a vegan option that was diverse and unique, from the seediest pubs to the mom and pop diners to the classiest fine dining establishments. I had a lentil “meatloaf” with roasted vegetables, “meaty” chili with beans, ratatouille, vegetable and tofu stir fry, pizza with vegan sausage and vegan cheese, even a vegan cheesecake! (Vegan desserts are unheard of in the U.S. unless you go to a vegan restaurant or bakery, which you’ll usually only find in college towns and big cities). \n\nAnd not only that, but every single menu item in every restaurant has numbers at the bottom that correspond to allergen information. I don’t remember the exact number correspondences, but an example might be: 1,2,11,12,14,15,16 and so on, with 1 perhaps being meat, 2 is soy, 3 is shellfish, etc. with the same numbers meaning the same allergen everywhere in the country.

After getting to our accommodation, we packed our stuff down and went sightseeing. First thing ofc was the beach, seeing that incredible mass of water for us, teens from the Great Plains of Hungary was a priority. So we are on the beach, eating fish and chips and we notice that a lot of flats in the city have rainbow flags hanging out. Not gonna lie, we actually didn't know what they meant. Suddenly we see an extremely tall, like 6.4 kinda black guy and a small, like 5.2 white guy walking next to each other. Nothing extraordinary. Then randomly the small one reaches up to the other guys neck, pulls him down and gives him one of the most demanding kisses I've ever seen anyone get. We were shocked. Then our guide explained that this country is a bit more open minded and the rainbow flags are actually signs of the LGBT community. That was my first open presentation of actual gay people. Just two normal guys kissing. I went home and my worldview and the indoctrinated homophobia and racism got left behind. Fast forward 5 years and I came out as bi. I'm extremely thankful for those two guys who presented non-heterosexuality and interraciality. They changed my perception of the world and because of that I met a lot of great people and friends.",

            "text": "I'm a Canadian guy living in Germany. I've noticed many cultural differences in the last three years. One big difference comes to mind though: Cigarette smoking is considered a disgusting, selfish, self-destructive habit in Canada. You aren't allowed to smoke in most public places and smokers are treated with scorn if even the tiniest whiff of smoke drifts someone's way. At the same time, weed is legal in Canada and you smell weed smoke almost every day in Canada (Ok I'm from Vancouver). Loads of people sit outside or at the beach in the summer and puff away liberally and no one minds breathing in a bit of their smoke... as long as it isn't \\*cigarette\\* smoke. I find this hilarious since weed smoke is combusted plant matter and is also potentially carcinogenic, just without the added chemicals found in cigarettes.  \n\nIn Germany, you can barely walk down the street (at least prior to covid when things were busy) without inhaling cigarette smoke. People just smoke and walk, or puff away at busy tram stops even if there are school kids waiting at the stop (I saw this at least once a week for months). I've waited at busy tram stops where three or more people have been smoking cigarettes and nobody has said a word to complain. If one person dared to smoke at a busy bus stop in Canada, the normally polite Canadians would likely tell them to fuck off and cite their paranoia about \"second hand cancer\" (Which I think is fair, but it should be applied to any kind of smoke). \n\nDespite Germans' fondness for cigarettes, weed is still relatively taboo here. Germany is definitely a very liberal country, more so than Canada in some ways, and people generally see weed as pretty benign but they still don't tolerate it as much. Of course, it is also not legal here, but in three years living here and talking to lots of people about it, it seems like people have a lot less knowledge about weed and don't trust it as much as Canadians do. There is definitely WAY more stigma around it even from people who believe it should be legalized. I can't remember the last time I smelled weed in public here and people would never toke up in a busy park. \n\nI don't smoke cigarettes or weed but I think Canadians and Germans both have funny double standards about what they will and won't tolerate.",

It's like they didn't even clear away anything over the course of time - they literally just kept building on top of it after it burnt down/etc. You can see it in the roads, the way the buildings are laid out, the way the city is terraced, and so on. It was really fascinating. One of the many places we've been to internationally that we walked almost everywhere in just because it was so neat.\n\nAlso, the afterhours performers were incredible. I'll never forget when we stumbled across a woman playing a huge electric harp on the river outside of Vatican city and ended up sitting and listening to her for hours. Her voice was hauntingly beautiful. We gave her so much money because she didn't have any music to sell us, but it was money well spent imo.\n\nCuba: We did 10 days of a guided tour all across Cuba with a super informative tourguide, and then spent 3 days solo in airbnbs doing our own thing (we legit stayed in Fidel Castro's sister's palace for like $35 a night, it was amazeballs). The tourguide was awesome and taught us all sorts of neat things, but the most notable thing we learned about from her was how insanely advanced Cuba's medical system is. The Cuban government has dumped most of its money since the 50's into developing it's medical research and knowledge, and has shipped doctors out all over the world to help with crises and/or impoverished places without hospitals and the like. Doctors also travel to Cuba from all over the world to train and learn there. It's a huge industry for them.\n\nThe other thing about Cuba that we noticed and learned a lot about was the impact that Russia has left on it. There's a lot of that there in the tourism sector, some attitudes, city layouts and stuff like that, but the physical imprint of crazy giant Brutalist buildings and structures that they have left on the land is really striking and memorable. Especially in places like the hotel side of Havana (the former Russian embassy is literally a giant broadsword stuck in the ground that throws a huge shadow over the russian-built row of hotels from there to the beach), the monuments (especially the Ché memorial and the Castro remembrance area), and many of the larger apartment buildings and such.

Now for about a hour we were planning like americans on what to do.  \n\n\nthen i forgot who mentioned the fact we werent in america anymore.   so thanks to the internet we had a doctor show up AT THE AIR BNB WE WERE STAYING AT in less the 3 hours!    \n\n\nchecked my dad out and gave him 3 prescriptions for weapons grade medicine.

Its common to see people taking naps outside, and casually burping while talking and its no big deal. Oh, and gender standards, its normal for men to carry babies and play with them affectionately (my Italian friend told me Italian men don't even push the pram). You can see women working in construction and waste refuse type jobs. Also, young women (20s I guess) hanging out in parks on a Saturday night at 3am drinking without a single worry.\n\n🇯🇵Japan: Absolutely spotless.\n\nI know you asked for one thing but I feel there's so many interesting ones I couldn't give just one.

Zig, brake, zag, brake, zig, brake, etc. He was NOT dumb. Brilliant kid, fantastic employee, great work ethic. So I doubt it was a \"him\" problem.\n\n2: Bluntness was not as appreciated when I was helping out in the UK. As an example someone totally slacked off on something I asked them to do and gave me halfhearted garbage. I pulled them into my office and showed it to them and said \"If I had not checked this and I took it and ran with it, here's all the problems that would have caused.\"\n\n\"Okay, sorry, etc.\"\n\n\"Do you think this is acceptable?\"\n\n\"Well, no.\"\n\n\"Okay, I don't either. So I need you to tell me sometime today in an email how you intend to improve and the steps you're going to take to make sure this doesn't happen again. Thanks.\"\n\nThat kind of conversation is had all the time in the USA business world and is regarded as a pretty straightforward and professional reprimand with an emphasis on improvement (as opposed to flagellation which is unproductive). I got my wrist smacked for it in the UK and on a bunch of other occasions for conversations that would be normal course of business in the States. It's not that I had to handle people with kid gloves, but I just had to dance around it a bit more. And not specifically say \"steps you'll take/how will you improve\" etc. Apparently that came across as aggressive.\n\n3: I was basically told/warned that people would be very cold in Germany. That wasn't my experience at all. Everyone I worked with while I was there was very warm and welcoming and inquisitive not only about the USA, but about Asia, the UK, and other places I had been in my travels.\n\n4: China doesn't have biker gangs; they have moped gangs.

This is an environment with  many rules, regulations, laws, etc.\n\nWhen I arrived in Amsterdam, it was a culture shock.  So much of what was prohibited for you were socially shamed for here was allowed there.  Soft drugs, porn, and then there is legalized prostitution.  The Amsterdam red light district.  A taxi driver drove my parents and me through that area and acted as an amateur tour guide as he explained what was done there, what was prohibited, etc.\n\nImagine me, a sixteen-year-old teenager raised in rules-top-heavy-USA and confronted with that world!",

It took until we checked into our hostal in Madrid on day 6 of an 8 day trip to meet someone who spoke English with any level of fluency more than knowing a few key sentences or having to stop first to translate what we said in their heads and conciously think of the words they were going to say next. Even our \"English speaking\" tourguide struggled a bit when going off script to answer question asked in English. \n\nWhen we travel we don't expect people in other countries to speak English, and we didn't have too much trouble communicating on this trip as we speak way better Spanish than we do French or German. Except in Barcelona where a significant portion of the population speaks Spanish as a 2nd language to Catalan, and English as their 3rd. But even people working in the travel industry didn't speak English too well, the aforementioned tourguide for one but also the customer service people at the train station in Madrid, the people manning the front desk at our first 2 hostals, cashiers and ticket sellers at tourist traps. Which was definitely not my experience in France or Germany, so it was just interesting for me as I wasn't expecting it to be so different.

Ha, fuck that. The only diversity was the clear difference between Hong Kong vs mainland Chinese immigrants. The only white people I saw worked at the airport. I'm sure there's more, but clearly the diversity was a lot lower than I assumed.\n\nThe only place in Asia that's diverse enough to say its diverse is Singapore. \n\nFast forward to my trips to Europe. I thought it'd be different. But no, even though they're so close together and have good relations the countries have largely remained culturally homogenous. \n\nQuite the eye opener.",

Going to Japan in 2019, around august it was a surprise to experience a typhoon. I think it was storm Krosa. I've never experienced wind like that, or rain. Luckily I was in Kyoto so it wasn't something I feared for my life with, but seeing all the police in the streets making sure people got home safe was surreal.\n\nAnother thing that shocked me in Japan was how quiet the trains are & punctual. Always on time, dead silent while on the trains, and relatively quiet in terms of the vehicle itself. Growing up in Scarborough & Toronto, our Trains are loud as shit, usually late, and people are disrespectful and downright belligerent. So yeah it's shocking to see the flipside.\n\nOther than that it was just mild culture shock, and overall awe of the absolute beauty of Kyoto. I gave up on taking pictures of scenery by the 3rd day as they simply weren't doing it justice.\n\nGoing to America on my own for the first time was also kind of surprising. The first time seeing a cop with a gun that wasn't a glock was kind of surreal. In detroit or chicago greyhound terminal the thing strapped to the guys hip had to be the size of my forearm.

The worst thing I experienced was being called a \"flea\" on a train in Stuttgart, Germany. Now, I know that is definitely the minority of people. I just find it strange how Americans always glamourize Europe as a whole as being an open and not racist at all place. It is always dependent on where youre at. \n\nOther than that I loved all my European travels. UK, Spain, Germany, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, The Netherlands, Austria, Romania, and Bulgaria. All places with great distinct features. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFavorite place is definitely Maastricht, Netherlands though. Constanta, Romania is a close second place. :)",

So apparently some people are trying to change the culture of non-stop honking.\n\nAlso when I visited Delhi I was surprised to see a lot of huge half-built office/apartment buildings. According to the Indians I talked to, these were buildings that were abandoned mid-construction because the government revoked their permit. The best part was that I saw a bunch of monkeys playing in one of these half-built buildings. It looked like the monkeys probably took it as their home.\n\nOne more thing on that note - holy crap there are monkeys everywhere in India! I'm from Kansas so the idea of seeing a monkey just walking around in the street is so bizarre! I guess Indians might think the same thing about me having raccoons and opposums in my backyard. One time I saw a huge hoard of monkeys on the side of the highways outside of Delhi - like dozens and dozens. Another time I saw a group of monkeys playing on a fence. I walked up to maybe 10 feet away from the monkeys when the Indians I was with were like dude, you are too close and that monkey there looks like he is about to attack you. Great times.",

So sometimes the favelas empty and they stack burning tires and debris in the highway to stop traffic in both directions so they can rob people. Then the cops show up and make it worse by literally having a gun battle between civilian cars. If you think about a major highway like I10 in the US... imagine getting a radio bulletin that there are barricades up and a raging street battle when you're about 10km (5ish miles) away... then imagine u-turning on the highway and driving back to where you came from cuz you don't want to get shot and robbed on the highway... almost didn't make my flight back bc of this.\n\nEdit: Another tip about driving in Brazil's large cities like Rio; at night you run the red lights because if you stop you might get robbed... and/or murdered. Best to stay indoors after midnight really, especially as a tourist.",

I’m from California, and whenever I go on the freeway, even in rural areas it is decently traffic filled, and near large cities you can expect basically no movement for minutes at a time. In addition, the cities are frocking huge. I went to Atlanta, Georgia and some other cities, the traffic is basically nonexistent on the freeways (or highways, I think that’s what they’re called over there). The large cities weren’t that “developed” far less skyscrapers and a lot more natural views. Also there’s water everywhere, just random giant masses of water, in California those masses of water would be considered so cool and rare, but in Georgia they’re everywhere. Also the humidity, where I live it rarely gets over 30% humidity, in Georgia it’s well over 60%. Also there are so many trees. But also a ton of bugs :(. Also I heard bad things about it Southern people, so I was prepared for awkward interactions with racists, but I didn’t meet any. Most of them were older, fatter, and lack some teeth, and I guess like “boomers”, but they were extremely nice  and tried to be helpful and didn’t seem to care about race, in fact, I really like those people. Much different from California, where I regularly see people push others, or angrily yell at people. Honestly, if it weren’t for the bugs and humidity, I would move there in an instant, the house prices are pretty cheap compared to California lol.",

I look at the building. Same thing. Suddenly, everywhere I look, it's all square (Robertson) screws. \n\nI asked my dad, who was Canadian, about it, and turns out, yeah, almost everything there is Robertson drive. They don't strip, or jump, they are pretty much better than Philips, but the only place they are popular is in Canada. \n\nI did some more research, and apparently it came down to Robertson being an awesome engineer, and a horrible salesman. When Ford's were being designed, they realized they couldn't use slotted, flat blade screws, since those jump easily, and instead needed something better. \n\nPhilip's design was a self torquing screw that was supposed to jump/strip when the correct torque had been met. The only other competitor, Robertson, had a far better design, one that wouldn't strip, and would last much longer. Unfortunately, he pretty much just said \"nah, I'm happy with the business in Canada.\" \n\nIt wasn't entirely Robertson's fault, Ford did like Philip's design since it was perfect for the assembly line, with it's \"self torquing\" nature, but unfortunately, since Ford model T's became the standard, so did their screws, the Philips. Only in Canada did they have something different. \n\nIt's especially frustrating now, because Philips screws were meant to be for specific installations that required a certain torque. Instead, we use them as a random, everyday screw. Even more hilariously, in my job working on aircraft, if I see a screw that does require a specific Torque, it's almost always something like Torx. Torx was another bit designed for standard, everyday use, to be better than Philips. \n\nIn this wacky, wacky world, we are using almost all of our screws wrong. The Canadians though, they got it figured out. \n\nAnd yeah, some people would argue Philips are better because you can get a flat blade in there, or use a #2 in a #1, or something. That slight benefit does not outweigh the annoyance when the screw strips out on you.",

No litter on the streets, or anywhere really. And everyone was SO nice! We went on a couple tours and one of them consisted of taking a ferry to a small island (I don’t remember the name) off of Reykjavík(the main city) but when it came time to leave, we weren’t able to since it was supposed to storm that evening and the captain didn’t feel safe. So here is a boat full of tourists expecting a day trip only to have it turn into an overnight stay. My memory is a little foggy but I remember how a random woman let me and my parents stay the night at her house. Just saw us 3 and was like “Hi! You can stay with me.” She even made us breakfast in the morning! (She had homemade jam from her garden which is STILL the best toast I’ve ever had) and while I happily accepted her kindness I remember admiring/being surprised by how trusting she was. Iceland overall is so beautiful, but knowing how kindly I’ll be treated makes me want to go back even more than I already do haha",

They are so  freaking, ridiculously loud and when they test them unbeknownst to lil old new to the country me, they will just sound them constantly n they go off for a few minutes or so. Doesnt sound too crazy in writing but when you're in that situation and have no clue whats happening and after a minute or so start to wonder why the noise is still happening, your logic is like, they are probs just checking something with the sirens it'll stop in a sec. \n\nThat thought is quickly obliterated after a cpl mins of this sound non stop n thats when i was like WTF do i do. Thinking If it was just a test they'd maybe just play em a cpl of times or something right but not for this long no way thats just plain fukin CRAZY and totally UNNECESSARY, it just cant be a test, they deffs would of stopped it ages ago if it was only crazy people would think what is happening is anything close to normal..........but oh no, no sir, not at all, not the bloody dutch..no no, they really gotta make sure those suckers are working.\n\nI was literally just waking up at the time, i think it was around 9.30am or 10am.  I started making a coffee and all of a sudden fukin woooooooooooooooop woooooooooooooooop wooooooooooooop oh great i thought the fukin germans are coming. \n\nI literally have only ever associated that type of sound with like WW2 & WW1 viideo or radio broadcasting services at the time, all i knew what that sound meant was imminent death is quickly approaching get yo butt ugly ass underground and hide. Its was so crazy and i was so obliviously unaware this was an actual normal safety thing over there and apparently it's a sign to show everything is ok & not to panic at all.  🤔🤔 \n\nYeah ok holland lets blast air raid sirens non stop at full blast, that creates a sound that can only be described as giving you the feeling of  \" well your fuked mate\" and thats the bloody signal that everything chill. That's what you guys went with. Seriously mate, Are you guys all fukin crazy. How about if the sirens are not on then alls chill and when she hits the fan then fukin blast ya air raid sirens all you want.\n\nLike i said crazy dutch bastrds. \n\nSo anyway as i ran up and down this icey, desolate caravn site looking for just anyone, just one person who could explain what is currently happening atm or just acknowledge it actually was happening or if they were also panicking.  I just needed to see how the other people reacted to gage whether or not i should pack my shit and run for the hills. \n\nI couldnt find anyone at all, i had circuled the caravan park 3 times now becoming increasingly more scared. All the while i was frantically trying to call my girlfriend who was at work and couldnt answer her phone. So i was just totally clueless and didnt know if my life was in danger or i needed to get the fuk outta dodge quickly or what? I was very confused and was in a shear state of panic, thinking i was gonna be blown up or bombed any second.\n\nI would of looked like a total fukin knob head, what an absolute Bellend mate, running around this caravan park in my fukin thongs, undies, singlet and a blanket wrapped over my shoulders, spilling my coffee everywhere as i ran around the place. Banging on all the doors trying to make phone calls and literally yelling. WTF WTF WTF WTF is anyone there?? Lol what a cock haha\n\nNow that i think about it im guessing ppl probs were there but saw me and was like fuk that, dont answer the door, just pretend we are not home, that guys fukin metal. Just look at him 😂\n\nOnce all the commotion was over and the sirens ceased to blast over the whole fukin countryside, i shrugged myself back to the caravan n sat on the couch, n just thought that was intense, i still had to wait till my gf called me so i could try to understand what the hell just went down. Had a few hrs of just sitting there confused as hell wondering if id imagined the whole thing. Looking at the spliff i bought like damn this is good shidd.\n\nFinally i got my answer to why the sounds of death is coming had taken place and what it all meant. Probably the most suprised, scared totally bewildered feeling ive ever felt in my life. Like come on Holland, you gotta warn peeps about that kind of shit. Why you gotta just drop that shit on a brother without any warnings n shit. Just plain cruel bro haha\n\nCant ve just waking up n thinking everything is normal, nice frosty morning, im in a new country, got a new crib, ima just make my coffee and then boom WW3 has just somehow started and apparently this caravan park is gonna be one of the battlefields for this invasion attempt or whatever bad thing thats clearly about to happen and ur in the middle of shittown. Lol  Was a completely terrifying experience i can laugh at now but yeah, like just give people a brochure or something you know a lil head up. \n\n\"Like hey guys welcome to the Netherlands FYI if you hear the sound of death and destruction suddenly start echoing through the lands dont worry this is just a signal to say alls good. So do not panic, dont run around the country side half naked screaming WTF WTF as u throw coffee everywhere. Please just wait for the sirens to cease and continue with your day thanks and bye. Thats all it would take guys. Ya cant keep scaring ppl with this, i cant be the only person this has happened to.\n\nIf thats a signal to say all is good to everyone then i dont wanna know what they do if shit actually goes down for real haha\n\nThey are a Bunch of crazy dutch bastards \n\nAnyway thats my story, much love and peace out guys  🙂",

I definitely belong in Italy! The artwork is in everything they touch. I really cant begin to describe the incredible artistry everywhere you look!A friend and I took a day off from the group we were traveling with. When you are in Italy, it is surprisingly easy to pick up the dialect. We went out for a lunch, some of the wonderful people actually host you, and  serve you in their own homes. Anyway, we walked through a cemetery that was very unique to us. It was mainly vaults of mausoleum type drawers with engraving. The best part was the eternal flames in beautiful,  glass sconces, run by propane, I believe. We had dinner one night at an astonishingly unique and beautiful huge stone castle.\n After that we went back to our cottages, met outside in rows of chairs, and had a famous orchestra and an incredible opera singer performed outside under the moon and stars. Absolutely breathtaking! The night ended with serene, meaningful Chinese Lanterns being released to join the stars. \nMy husband who arranged the trip has since passed away. I haven’t been strong enough yet to put the photo chips in the computer and see our incredible, beautiful trip in photos...yet!  \nThe most incredible journey of my life!!!",

I told them I chose Germany because I might still be related to people here and one of the guys said he knew where I could find more info and told me to meet him at their version of a hall of records in the morning (I don't remember what it was called, he gave me and address). We said our goodbyes after making plans, and I started to drunkenly stagger to my hotel, when the hall of records guy comes up and asks if I want to have dinner with him and his wife. So I go and have some AMAZING sausage, and his wife offers me their spare bedroom. The next morning we go and find out that I am indeed related to 2 people currently living. One was 45 minutes away, and the other was in Hamburg. He took me to go meet my great-great-uncle. Who turned out to be ok, but I could tell he was either a nazi, or Nazi sympathizer.
