There was a very hot new AE who would join us for drinks and we got to talking. First time we did the deed was on a company trip - tons of fun and no one in the company could know... so we kept it way on the down low.  It started to become a very regular thing - easily 5 or 6 times a week. So much so that  I was keeping clothes in my office and would go to the gym to shower after spending the night at her place. We both had no desire to date - we just loved having sex together.\n\nSo, cut to getting caught - It's probably about 11pm or so - we are in our office and I am banging her on her desk. It is great shit - total shit show sex - we've had a few drinks... We wore business suits to work - so it was even good that way - dirty all around.\n\nMid thrust the door to her office opens - it is a coworker (they shared offices) who heard us and had no idea we were doing the deed...just walked in... or, so we thought....\n\nShe opens the door, I am trying to pull away - and she says - no no, keep going... walks over panties off and starts masturbating.. I mean brings the titties out and blam.. within a couple minutes were all flesh and banging...\n\nWe all finish up - go back out to the bar and the two of them play around with each other - eventually we go to a karaoke bar and then to the first girls place...  have sex again and that is where I woke up with the both of them the next morning.\n\nBUT THERE IS MORE...\n\nThat was their plan all along - the two office mates were talking about the first girl and I banging - and the first girl said - I'll bring him back to the office... and the REST IS AMAZING HISTORY I WILL CHERISH UNTIL I DIE.",

This lady went out and bought a $180 bottle of cologne a teddy bear balloons and flowers for him.\n\nso with that being said a room full of law enforcement officers just put two and two together and were like yeah they must be fucking in thst line of work that's what you call a clue.\n\nAlso people would have sex in their patrol cars with each other bathrooms offices pretty much anywhere especially on third shift. Not going to lie there was some fun times had and there's nothing like rushing to put on a duty belt to get to a call.

I don't do drugs or engage in a lot of toxic habits. So when I started getting to know my coworkers I was really put off by the amount of pill popping and sleeping around that happened.  It's like the women were just passed around from male PI to male PI (principal investigator).  It was super gross.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nTwo main things happened that were just awful:  The head of obesity research (the main object of this institute) had been having an affair with one of his married post docs.  Her husband also worked there and they had kids.  Instead of breaking it off like a decent human being the guy just straight up announced the affair at a morning lab meeting and that it was too bad if you had a problem with it and you shouldn't gossip.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe other thing involved my bestie.  She began dating a coworker who had recently broken up with a different coworker.  It had gone badly.  My friend ended up pregnant and the ex gf hurled non-stop harassment at her --like dressing up as her for Halloween, nastygrams, comments in the hallway  --schoolyard bullying behavior.  She even went to their house and peeked in windows for some reason.  The worst was after baby came the ex made a copy of one of the baby's pics, drew devil horns on it and the words \"demon spawn\"   She then put this pic in my friend's desk.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWe ended up going through the process of getting a restraining order but it eventually failed because the research institute refused to testify...I should also mention that the ex was a direct report to the head of obesity research, the guy who was banging his married post-doc.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIt was a complete and utter cesspool to work at.  Since then I have never been tempted to have sex with any coworker.  barf.",

When the party was finished I was cleaning up and taking things back upstairs to the office, and caught his fiancé having sex with another one of our coworkers right there in the office. They were doing it on one of the other accountants desk. It was disgusting, but it made for some great blackmail to get me the head position of the party planning committee.",

She had a thing for me in a suit... So once she's done I was all about it and laid her phone on the floor, still fully clothed the both of us, she just hiked her skirt up and I'm pounding on her real good... Then we hear the main office door open and we both stop but don't move. Immediately I hear Spanish being spoken so I'm like on its the cleaning lady, she'll probably just empty the trash in the kitchen and leave - nope. She opened the door wide singing, her and her friend just stared at us for a good 3 or 4 seconds then she grabbed the garbage and closed the door while we laid there... Me ontop of the girl balls deep.\n\nThe next week, I asked all kinds of questions about their schedules and figured Thursday was a good day. So I brought a different girl in. This time on the couch in the kitchen area of the office. Luckily I was getting a bj and the girl just pretended to be laying on the couch with her head on my crotch but her hair trying to cover up all my mess didn't quite sell it. So the lady goes \" Dios mio este muchacho\" and turned around and left.\n\nOn FRIDAY of the same God damn week, my coworker stayed behind and this time I wasn't taken any risks, so we went to the parking lot, parked against a wall, she parked her car next to mine and we opened both doors so you couldn't see in between. So I'm balls deep in this one from behind and guess wtf came to park next to our cars. The 2 God damn ladies again.\n\nI just peaked over the door, we looked at each other. She just shoot her head and I waved hi, don't know why\n\nLong story short... She left me a note that said to put a piece of red paper on the door whenever I was \" busy\" and she would come do my office last\n\nI bought that lady so many coffees and cookies and left her flowers for mothers day and shit like that for the 2 years I was in the office\n\nHer name was Alicia, were buddies to this day.\n\nI got her a city job. She's told her whole family how we met lol I've been to a, bunch of her home cook outs.\n\nIf you're not living life when you're young you're missing out",

While walking to the washroom she said she always wanted to snowboard. I told her it’s lots of fun and she should try. She then asked if I would teach her. I told her that I was pretty expensive and not sure if she could afford me. She looked up and said “well I could pay you in other ways”. I said oh really? Then she asked if there was a handicapped bathroom. I showed her the way and locked the door behind us. She immediately ripped my pants off and started going down on me after I few minutes I bent her over the sink and we had a great time. As we’re getting cleaned up I realized I left the bar unattended. Oh shit I gotta go. I told her to wait for me to leave before she comes out.

As I was wrapping up for the night, a girl who worked in the department across from mine (Shoes) said that there was some box that was high on shelf in the store room in the middle of the floor that she couldn’t get to and needed someone taller to safely bring it down. She was barely 5 foot tall, really petit, and gorgeous. She was also 7 years older than me. I jumped the chance to help her out, as she was one the most attractive girls that worked at the store. It seemed like every guy tried to get at her, that worked there except for me. At the time, I considered myself to be pretty average. I was 20 working  a part time job with nothing really going for myself. The thought of being with a girl like her was essentially a fantasy so I never tried talking to her.\n\nI walked in the store room with her and she points to this really large box on top of these shoe boxes on the top shelf that looked like it going to fall over. I stood on the on the second to last step on the A-Frame ladder and reached for the box and it felt empty and as I lifted it she grabbed the inside of my thigh. The motion caught me by surprise and I fell forward a little into the shelving knocking over a few shoe boxes. She said that it looked like I had something on my leg and tried to get it. I came down the ladder Only to see her bent over picking up boxes in a very “invitational” way. Butt sticking up high in air, her teased chocolatey brown hair off to the side, exposing her neck, slightly looking back at me. I pretty much ran my hand on inside of “her”thigh and said that she looked like she had something on her leg too. Next I thing I know I find myself kissing her neck, then her lips and then picking her up and carrying her off to another part of the storage room we had arguably the best sex I’ve ever had in my life. To this day I still think about it. \n\nAnyway, a few days later I get called to LP office telling me that they caught the whole thing on camera and even showed me some of the footage right before the hot and heavy part. A few days after that they let both of us go. \n\nWe married a year later and have been together since.",

My boss R was going out of the country to travel the world with his new wife and left his brother, L in charge. At the time I was in an abusive relationship with my child's father and was addicted to oxycontin after breaking my leg and getting road rash in an accident.             \n             \nI was worried about L taking over because he had aggressively pursued me while knowing I was in a relationship. About two weeks after R left, L cut my hours in half. A little bit more than half, actually. I called him to talk about it. He couldn't hear me properly and asked me if he could order me an uber to come to the bar to talk. My ex said it was fine so I said ok. It was about 9 on Sunday morning when I got there but I could smell alcohol on his breath so I was immediately on edge. Don't want to go into great detail here but to keep my hours up I would have to be assaulted by him. At the time I had been saving my cash tips for about four months and literally burying money in my garden to save to leave so my ex wouldn't find it. That combined with this guy being over a foot taller and probably a hundred pounds heavier than me - I said ok.         \n               \nHe would have me stay late sometimes and on occasion he would call me an uber to come back to the bar after I had already gone home to do a \"recount of the money and liquor\", or that is what he would tell me to say to my ex. This had been going on for a few months when someone who used to work at the bar stopped by and before they left they came up to me and said \"you know... That camera right there *points up to a particular camera* that camera relays video AND sound. And anyone can log in to view it if they have the url. Have a good night\". It sat with me for a few days, wondering wtf they could have meant... What did they see? Did I give someone a drink for free? Then the next time I was being assaulted by L I looked up and realized that every assault happened in the same spot, under that particular camera. He was recording this and allowing others to watch. It explained the relentless harassment I started getting from his friends.           \n           \nA few days after that our point of sale machine broke. We did paper accounting for a couple days until our new machine came in but L didn't realize we needed to hire someone to program it but I got an idea: what if I programmed it to be very beneficial for me? That's exactly what I did :) I programmed it over an afternoon. The following two months I saved enough money to leave both the job and my ex with our son. We moved close to my family and now I'm back in college and doing well despite the pandemic. Fuck you, L.",

I gave them the whole \"you have got to be fucking kidding me\" thing and send one of them to clean the dining room and the other to start with trash and dishes. When I finally had the chance to confront them she said that she only blew him, no sex - as if that was supposed to help her case.\n\nMostly pissed that they abandoned the rush and left their co workers and myself to struggle and that they didn't seem to care that everyone in the building saw them walk out of the bathroom like that more than I was angry that they were doing whatever they were doing in there, not having sex or whatever. After they finished cleaning up after people and doing all of the cook's dishes, I fired them. They both cried (bc they are actual children).\n\nThe next day the 16 yo girl's mom came in ready to fight for her baby, towering over me about why did I fire her daughter and clearly having no idea what happened. I could see the girl sitting in her mom's mini van out in the parking lot while this woman is screaming in my face about her little angel being mistreated by our establishment. That was a fun conversation for me, and an enlightening one for that woman. I made sure she knew how on display this entire event was. \n\nThe real kicker was when I got a call from two other stores shortly after bc they were both trying to get their jobs back at other locations, not knowing that if you apply saying you've worked for the company before, we call each other to make sure there aren't any red flags. Needless to say, they were not hired.",

He was caught on camera entering an office with a night janitor and she confessed that they had been having sex at work.  When confronted, he admitted to having sex with her and they said that he would be terminated.  He agreed but first aksed them to show him where it explicitly said in the company policy that having sex on company grounds was prohibited.  He had already reviewed the company policy and knew he had a claim of potential wrongful termination and they did as well. Soon after we had an updated corporate policy release with some clarification on what was considered appropriate work behavior.  The guy actually stayed with the company for years and went on to work in manufacturing where he was terminated for more self destructive behavior.\n\nEdit: Several asked for other stories so I'll share a few of the ones I recall and aren't too personal to him.  \n\nOnce he we just beyond the city limits (large city) to a decent size river/creek.  Was shooting a sawed off shot gun into the water when the police came after numerous complaints. He had all the license required to \"duck hunt\" and could legally hunt there but the officers had to talk him into moving to a safer location.  He was not hunting at all.\n\nThe other story I recall was him driving a tiny front loader at work that a 3rd party contractor had brought in for the day.  He ended up fucking something up and then using the safety policy against the company as a way to protect himself.  I can't recall the exact reasoning behind this one, but we all thought it was the end for him, but he managed to work himself out of it.",

The call centre was mostly people in there 20's and early 30's, long hours and shitty employee morale, so sometimes it felt like people were just fucking to pass the time. \n\nIt was a union job so it was generally hard to lose your job, you really had to fuck up hard to actually get fired, and even then the union would fight to get your job back. So usually when it happened the punishments were a write up and/or suspension and getting moved to a different team if needed.  \n\nThese are a couple times that stick out in my mind.  \n\nThe first one was the time that a couple got caught in the \"nurse's room\".  Essentially it was a quiet room built off of the company lunch room where if you weren't feeling well you could go and lay down on the bed that was in there.  I assume that people were fucking in there a lot but after the one couple got caught it was renovated I think into an arcade room. \n\n\nThe second time was a buddy of mine, who was a call centre rep who was given a developmental opportunity with the management training team.  He was the on call manager one night and he was caught in one of the conference rooms, on a completely different floor, with his girlfriend.  Now they weren't actually caught fucking, as far as I know, he had given an excuse of his girlfriend needed to use one of the scanner/printers (or something like that).  Everyone universally assumed that they had been fucking though, he was removed from the management training and was put back on the phones.\n\nEdit: one time that I can't believe I forgot to mention was the time that one of the Loyalty managers was caught fucking his team members.   It had apparently been going on for a long time and he was able to get away with it because he was the manager of the at home team.  From what I was told he would pop by for \"home inspections\" and was fucking a couple of different reps on his team.  He only got caught when one of the people on his team reported it.  \n\nThe company and the union did their investigations, that manager got fired and two other managers who were apparently aware of what he was doing also got fired. \n\nI don't know how things are now, since I left Telus about 7 years ago, but for a long time people were fucking like their lives depended on it in the Telus call centre.",

She went into the road first then I followed a few seconds later and she sat down to give me a blow job in the dark of the room.\n\nBlow job was a solid 8/10 and during it, I felt like I saw someone peeping and then I looked and saw nothing so I paid it no mind. 2 months or 3 months later my coworker made a blow job joke and I paid no mind to it as he saw us go in another time after and thought we were gonna have sex their, in turn we were but just chilled as he was outside watching us talk. \n\nA bud asked me if I ever got a BJ from someone in the front room and I was paranoid like ,”huh? No I didn’t, did someone say something?”\nTurns out another weirdo quite co worker saw us because was just one of those people that like to know your business and everyone’s but never talked his. \n\nSo a few of guys and probably one girl knew that I got a BJ from my coworker. But they didn’t know we were fucking in the A/C room while they are lunch (like 4 feet’s away) 😂😂\n\nIn work sex is fun, just don’t get caught and use a condom lol\n\nEdit: no we don’t talk anymore, it was a friends with benefits and she said she was getting into another relationship. But that didn’t pan out, dude just fucked here and left. She lies a lot and I just couldn’t trust her so I stopped talking to her and got a new job. She blocked me on Snapchat and what’s app lol",

Along with other reasons, he fired Cook A and put the bartender on the floor for a week as well as took away her GM title.

After flirting with one of our customers (and almost hooking up with him) and breaking it off with her husband, she decides to officially move in with the Cook A. \n\nDuring one of our staff parties, she got really drunk along with another cook (Cook B). Cook A was not at the party since he got fired. Both her and Cook B were all over each other and our whole team witnessed it. We all also knew that her and Cook A were a thing, so when she went home one of the servers messaged Cook A telling him everything that happened. About a week later, we find out that she was spreading rumors that Cook B drugged her which was why she was acting that way.

The owners were a partnership including the chef. I struck up a good friendship with him and we used to hang out, we both lived nearby and had similar interests and temperaments. All was good, or so I thought.  \n\nAt one point the chef's sister came to work at the place as a bartender. We always flirted and chatted and had quite a bit of chemistry. I dug her but wasn't really pursuing her so it didn't go too far. Until... \n\nOne night after closing up on a slow weeknight (so around 1 or 2) we were alone in the restaurant and as I came back upstairs from dropping the cash in the safe, there she was. Standing there with a certain look in her eye. We were in one of the only spots in the restaurant not visible from the street outside of the kitchen and she just approached me and we started making out. In due course, she dropped to her knees (squatting actually, which was kinda weirdly hot) and finished me with her mouth. \n\nI was gobsmacked but it was hot and delightful and neither of us really had any intention of taking it further, just a fun fwb moment. \n\nHowever, the chef must have found out. His attitude towards me changed and eventually he stopped speaking to me entirely. I don't believe there were cameras (as I had been around for the buildout and we had just had an incident with a customer during which one of the owners slipped and said there were no working cameras in the bar, but maybe they installed them after or maybe he was just passing by and caught an angle of it, or perhaps he even came in for some reason and we just didn't notice him.\n\nWhatever the case, the after shift bj was the only thing that happened that would have changed our deal and it changed so I always assumed that she either told him (uncharacteristic) or he witnessed it somehow. \n\nI also had some liaisons with guests there a few times without any repercussions that I am aware of, and plenty of hijinks with guest and coworkers at that place off site (we were a randy bunch!) throughout the 2 years I worked there and the years afterwards when I was just a neighbor and regular. \n\nI also \"worked\" at Ren Faires all over the states for over a decade, but reciting the number of times sexual inappropriateness (with myself and countless others that I am aware of) happened in that distributed \"workplace\" would be low hanging fruit for this thread.",

Things were a little awkward for a while though, especially because everyone knew he was married and had been unfaithful to his wife before.\n\nAlso, I also used to work at a sleepaway camp where the majority of the staff was in their late teens/very early 20s. It took me completely by surpise, but there was A LOT of fucking going on between the staff, in all sorts of wild places. In canoes (he got a tick bite, and his nickname in the group chat from then on was \"canoodling\"), in the pool, in the lifeguard shack (which had no door), in their cars, in the staff laundry center, straight up in the WOODS, etc. It mostly went down after the kids went to sleep at night and the counselors would sneak out of their cabins, but sometimes people would even sneak away during the day. Being caught would have gotten them fired IMMEDIATELY and sent home within hours, but people still did it all the time, and unless a member of our admin staff actually caught them, all they could do was take \"preventative measures.\" (Not that members of the admin staff didn't do it as well, but I digress). I remember having a conversation with the camp director (the adultiest adult in the place, maybe mid 40s) about how she'd wanted 1) to hang a hammock, but the directors of the neighboring sleepaway camps had swiftly talked her out of it, and 2) to turn a storage room into a staff lounge where counselors could relax away from the kids when they had time off, but because the entrance was so secluded and there were no windows, it would have meant admin staff would have to do regular \"pop-ins\" and that wouldn't have been practical.",

We had a shitty line cook who was in his early 50s constantly hitting on all the girls who worked in the kitchen. Then there was a chick (around 18 yrs old) who also worked on the registers who had a horrible reputation for hooking up with basically almost every guy in the store. She hated me because I guess she wanted to get to my then bf. What I didn’t know at the time was that there was a 40 year old lush and customer who would frequent the butcher counter where said then bf worked and I found out years later that he was banging ber behind my back (we were both 20 at the time). Fast forward 19 years, then bf turned into husband (I had serious self esteem issues) then ex and time comes full circle like stirrup pants coming back into fashion and he’s now married to cash register girl after she plotted to get knocked up. She finally got what she wanted after 19 years lol. My teenage daughter told me she has a tongue ring and that she asked her about it but stepmom was side stepping a response, just noting she got it in college. Mmm hmm.",

A contractor and recent divorcee was looking to \"get back in the game\" and was hitting on any attractive female in the office.  We warned him that's a dangerous game to be playing at work because the line between a relationship and sexual harassment is murky AF.  Especially being a contractor, they can let you go very easily.  One day a new girl starts, and he's chatting her up like everyone else.  Nothing bad.  Few days later he's blocking her from leaving her cube saying things like \"where you going honey?  Don't you want to talk?  I can show you a good time.  No rush baby.\"  Her boss saw it and immediately reported it to HR.  He was gone less than an hour later.\n\n2.  Working in desktop support for a new division at a major Healthcare corporation.  My manager was a classic colossal douche.  Got grandfathered into his director role because the small company (30 employees) he worked for was bought out and made into a new division of the corp.  Went from making 90k salary to ~900k overnight and it definitely went to his head.  Started treating his employees like shit to the point one had to be hospitalized due to a mental breakdown.\nA new manager was brought in to act as a buffer between him and his direct reports.  She was attractive and open about her lesbian sexuality.  An attractive underling that has no interest in him?  You can see where this is going.  He was known for getting really drunk at company parties, and spewing racist shit which he had been reprimanded multiple times for.  This time he got absolutely hammered and started hitting on her.  She of coursed refused his advances, which only made him angry to the point that he grabbed her arm and yelled that he was \"going to fuck her straight\" for everyone to hear.  He was let go 2 days later.  Not long after he lost his 600k house, his wife divorced him, lost custody of his kids, and he attempted suicide several times.",

It’s a three day/two night thing to a historical site that’s conveniently located near a theme park, so you spend day 1 on the bus and then touring the site, day 2 at the theme park, and day 3 is back on the bus to go home. At night, teachers take turns sitting in the hallway and making sure students don’t go into each other’s rooms/make too much noise. \n\nWhat happened: Two teachers, mrs.A and mrs.B are young (they turned 30 my senior year) and taught seniors only classes and went on senior trip. Both are married and have toddlers. They were roommates in college and are the coolest teachers at school because they don’t give homework. Everything was fine all senior trip until the bus ride home when Tiffany (cheerleader, very popular) is freaking out crying because her boyfriend of 2 years (Jason, football player with scholarship to a big name college) cheated on her. Everyone wants to know what girl would be dumb enough to sleep with him and also HOW it happened because teachers were in the hallways all night. The closer we get to home the more rumors there are. Now it’s not just Jason, apparently Matt also cheated on his girlfriend and wow the popular kids are all upset and there’s girls crying. Then there’s evidence. Tiffany found out because she got her hands on Jason’s phone and took screen shots of his conversations with Matt and after crying decided on revenge and sent them to EVERYONE. Screenshots where both boys talk about hooking up with Mrs.A and Mrs.B. Theres photo evidence in the screenshots with no denying that’s who’s in the pictures. Suddenly this is A BIG DEAL. How it happened was even detailed in the screenshots: mrs.A was on hall watch and let Jason go into the room she shared with Mrs.B and then they swapped and Mrs.B watched the hall and let Matt into the teacher room with Mrs.A. \nEveryone had seen the screenshots and the pictures (the teachers naked from behind, probably right after hooking up. the guys had clearly snuck a pic to send to each other) and administration announced on each bus that when we get back to the school we will all be brought to the auditorium before being allowed to take our cars/have our parents get us. We get back and there’s cop cars waiting. We all went inside and sat for nearly an hour before the principal came in and lectured everyone on professional conduct and not taking photos of your partners/sharing them without permission. Then we were free to leave. \n\nIt was on every local news channel the next day. Thankfully Jason and Matt were both 18 (barely) and said it was all consensual, but Jason lost his football scholarship and both teachers were moved to different schools and ended up divorced. Senior trip now requires teachers from different departments to be on hall duty together and administration chooses which teachers are paired for rooms.",

It wasn’t the schools parking lot but a lot of students walked on and through that parking lot because it was a short cut. Now I never really understood why they had to do it on that day but it was the first day back to school after holidays. So basically the highest attendance you would expect at school is on the first day after holidays. \nAnyways so I walk through that parking lot and there is a car parked (it was a particularly newer car which I liked, I’m kind of a car geek) it had that bright orange color and was really nice so I kind of approached it to see it from up close. Upon getting closer I noticed that the engine was running. But on first sight no one was in the car. So I got even closer until I saw a naked leg through the back seat window take a swing in the air as if it tried to get into a spoon position. Then it clicked, they were literally having sex at the possibly worst time and place. And I knew who that car belonged to, both of them were not attending this school so I ask myself to this day why that place at that possibly worst time.\nIf anyone’s wondering, for some reason I kinda was shocked at that moment so I didn’t get any closer. So I never saw the real action which in hindsight I think was better for both. I think it would’ve killed the vibe for both of us so I just hope the enjoyed",

Everybody was fucking /everybody/ this year. I was my DMs assistant more or less, and was rolling with him to several stores. The guy above him? Regularly slept with workers and would give them raises or other stuff(I mean the company was owned by Spencer’s.). My DM? Slept with several employees from the district, two of whom, who were married. We’ll come back to this guy later. At one store we had an employee fuck an underage employee(I mean he was 17), in her defense, she was in a relationship with a very abusive guy whose child she was also pregnant with, so I’m not surprised it happened. \n\nAt another store, we had one guy hook up with his girlfriend behind the fake walls that were set up. He got fired. At the same store another guy exposed himself to one of the assistant managers as she was coming out of the bathroom and got fired and arrested for sexual harassment. \n\nNow back to the guy who was my DM who I was assisting with. He was single and after the Halloween stores mostly shut down he got transferred and made the manager of a toyzam, and he brought me with him to work with him because we got on well. First fucking day, this married girl with a son, wants to hook up with him. I was in the car with him and he offered her a ride home. She was all “I don’t want to be the other woman.” And shit. He was single. She was MARRIED. At the same time as this is going on, this girl this guy was interested not related to work was becoming available and I was encouraging him to go after her. \n\nAnyway, awkward car time, DM asks me to leave the car while he has pulled over with this chick. I told him “fuck no. I ain’t waiting out here in this fucking city I know nothing about so you can hook up.” He asks me to give him fifteen minutes. I agree, and get a slice of pizza at 7-11, nothing happens there, but hoooooooo-boy, something certainly started.\n\nOur store, was dead. Like dead as fuck. As in, even on Black Friday we had only three customers between 4 AM and 12PM. How does my boss spend the time? Having as much sex as he can with the married chick in the office in the back of the store. Everyone knew it too, especially the other assistant manager(yes pregnant married girl was an assistant manager.). So she’s getting a bunch of hours, that guy isn’t. His boyfriend who is now working at the store too, isn’t. And the fucking dynamic there was a god damn powder keg. One girl focused on me and I did pretty much everything I could to make it clear I was not interested. My fucking boss even tries to arrange a “sleepover” at his house with that chick accompanying married chick as a cover so those two could fuck. I, did not attend. He even tried to rope in the VP of the companies assistant who was trying to get my boss as a replacement for the earlier mentioned Zone Manager because he ended up getting fired because payroll was fucked beyond belief for that year. \n\nHe would have had it fucking made if he had been able to keep his dick in his pants. But alas, he could not. Tensions rose at the store because my boss started seeing the previously mentioned newly available chick; which married chick knew. This then boiled over one day when I wasn’t present not my boss when she came in while the other assistant was in and he mentioned my boss going on a date with the uninvolved girl. She blew up on him and the two got into a fist fight in the middle of the god damned store in front of the VPs assistant. \n\nNeedless to say, when all the details became known, hammers fell. Both assistants were terminated(with the girl having sustained a concussion from the guy. Honestly, my money would have been on her in a fight prior to this.), my boss got terminated and not promoted to the position that was within his reach because he couldn’t stop fucking around, literally, and was blacklisted from the company. I became a commodity to be fought for because the VP assistant knew I was a problem solver and an adult. \n\nThe other people mentioned? Nothing happened. They all went on with their lives. Oh, and the manager at the Spencer’s that was in the mall I worked at the Toyzam in, was fucking various girls he hired, and fired one of the girls who was sick of his shit and wasn’t banging him. \n\nI am Calabask, and thank you for coming to my TED Talk.",

As they were minors, all the male staff was cautious around the girls but, you know, _intrigued_, so a lot of gossip was talked about them. There was this one girl who was famous for getting like _really_ flirty with men.  Everyone just tried to avoid her because it was not fun to be tempted like that. I though it was an exaggeration but then it happened to me... well, it was true, she was very direct. (I just said \"no\" and left. I was also a huge nerd back then so I was really nervous).\n\nAnywho, one day we were tasked to clean one of the banquet halls for an event and to avoid having her around, we sent her outside to sweep the area behind it, that was somewhat isolated from the public eye but in the street and very dark at night. A long time passed and she didn't came back. Some guy from security was sent to look for her. He found her kissing very passionately with a dude from maintenance with his pants down. I know this because the perv took a picture with his phone. The guy was fired and the girl just went to a different Hotel. \n\nThat was it. Pretty climatic, huh?",

Until one day I had returned to work a few hours after end of shit in the evening to pick up a car with a coworker we had left in the parking while running errands together after work only to find the apartment building that backed up to our workplace had my boss hanging out with a woman half his age. We thought this to be weird as none of us had know him to be social with the neighborhood for any reason. A few days later at a company cookout my coworker decided to ask my boss about this infront of the other company owners his partially retired parents.\n\nOh now this where it gets good. His mother this little 80 year old woman let's out a massive sob and starts screaming. Come to find out he had year prior done the same exact thing he was guilty of now. Renting a unit in the building behind our parking lot to house the flavor of the month. This man had been paying rent to have a convention and discreet piece of ass behind the workplace. All so he could be a dog and tell his wife he was working late. Apparently she would drive by and check that his car was there and move along. \n\nThe final cherry to the story is the reason why his retired parents were so upset was that apparently they had lived with the secret of the first time he had been unfaithful for many years and thought he would change. His mother immediately called his wife and over the next few weeks the apartment behind us went from his swinger pad to the last refugee he had to escape the divorce.",

She is my closing server, so after the kitchen goes home, she usually waits for me to finish the paperwork, has a drink or two, and we leave together. Now and then, we would fuck in the office.

Now, I was already known as a big flirt so it was no surprise when rumors started flying about myself and this girl. One weekend, I had plans to go to an event at a theme park about 3 hours drive, and my friend who was going with me got sick. I was casually chatting about it with this girl and somehow or another we ended up going together. Long story short, we hooked up on the trip and were a couple after that.\n\nShe told EVERYONE, thankfuly my manager didn't care. But I definitely took it too far, looking back at it now. Every week, I was required to 'mentor' cashiers who showed up on a computer-generated list based on different metrics. Because all of the cashiers were good, none of them really needed a counseling session...but I was required to counsel 5 per week.\n\nI ended up 'counseling' her every week, in the back office.  Worked out well until we broke up, and I still had to counsel her... she started dating someone else but we remained friendly. One of the counseling sessions, she was horny AF for whatever reason and kept trying to get me to pull out my dick. I refused, and ended the session. Opened the door, and went to the nearby employee bathroom -- because it's hard to hide a boner and I wanted to compose myself before returning to the sales floor. Well, she followed me into the bathroom and it didn't take too long before I gave in and she was sucking me off. An old lady whom works in the deli came in and saw it all.. She screamed in shock and left quickly. I don't think she ever said anything to anyone, because I never got in trouble and she avoided eye contact with me every time I saw her from that point on.\n\nInterestingly enough, that same girl I had dated, later came to me that the store co-manager was stalking her and leaving her creepy voice mails. I listened to the voicemails and was very creeped out about it. He was an English bloke, and there was no mistaking it was his voice. I was also good friends with his wife... His voicemail stated how he 'really liked her look' and wanted 'to get a taste'. And also about how he was 'right behind you on the highway, and didn't realize you lived that far'.. It was really creepy. Anyhow, I ended up reporting him to HR, the HR rep showed up at my store at like 9pm which was really unheard of. They fired him the next morning, his wife kicked him out and filed for divorce (apparently he had done this at a prior job and also lost his job over it). She ended up losing her management position because she had vouched for him when he was hired.\n\nI probably have enough grocery store stories to fill a book. Fights, Brawls, Murder, Sex, Orgys. You name it, I've seen it at a grocery store.\n\n..",

One of the women told us she didn't want flowers or romantic things, but she'd fuck a dude for 50 bucks to staples. At the time, I was engaged to my now wife, and didn't really care to hear about the various sexcapades from people 40 years my senior. I went to the bathroom, and when I came out, the woman was waiting for me, and asked if I wanted to take her to Staples. Noped out of that situation pretty fast lol",

I had been there a few years and was a known employee by that point. I finished my shift up front and went out for food and a quick drink with a friend before starting in the back. While we ate she asked if she could come through during my shift so I obliged and headed back to work. What I didn't know was that she was going to sit there and pound drink for the next hour and a half before heading my way. \n\nBy the time she shows up I've already let her in before I know she's wasted. Still coherent, but definitely not fit to drive, so I do my civic duty and proceed like a gentleman. Long story short; she gets too loud and I don't notice that the manager, my close friend by this point, was able to make it all the way into the storeroom and walk right up on us without me hearing a thing. He would later tell me he even stood there for a few moments while looking away before saying anything as not to interrupt anything magical. Fucker, lol.

            "text": "Caught? I spent my entire adult life up until a couple of years ago working in restaurants and bars. People have sex at work in that business, even mid shift. \n\nI never did. But I literally can't tell you how many people had sex on the clock at a place I was working at while I was there. I can't tell you because it's so many I can't put a number on it.\n\nThe first place I worked at I had started as a server and worked my way to being a trainer and then a bartender. We were having a bar cleaning one night after hours. I was standing on the bar digging out whatever was in the back of the overhead cabinets and I pulled out a red dress. One of the guys who had trained me behind the bar was kind of loud whispering \"Put that back.\" I'm not sure who, but he didn't want somebody to see it. He apparently had at one point had sex on the bar, probably after hours, and for whatever reason the woman's dress got left there.\n\nAt least four employees at this one place I worked at had sex with customers, most were mid shift. Three were on duty, one it was her off nights or after she got off, but still when it was busy. The three guys, separate occasions, would either just disappear or ask someone else to watch their part of the bar. Ten minutes later they come back from one of the bathrooms followed by a fat, sweaty chick. One guy did it frequently. The woman at this place was essentially prostituting herself out of that bar while being a bartender there. On her off nights she'd find some guy to leach on to. Either he could buy her drinks or give her drugs and she'd go out to the car basically right in front of the front door and fuck him. There's no telling how many guys she fucked like this. Multiple a weekend. Probably more than one a night sometimes. I don't remember her disappearing mid shift. She would often not work late so she might get off work at 7 or 8 pm and already have a target sited. She probably would score cash off of them too.\n\nManagers screwing waitresses? Happened at least at two places I worked. So far as I know the corporate place it did not cause a problem in our location. Though there was a location in New York where the GM got caught screwing an employee and he was instantly fired. Good news for a guy working with us. Steve(fake name) had started with the company as a dishwasher when he was 19. By 25 he had worked his way up to a managing chef position. That's when he got the call to be on a flight to New York at 3:00 in the morning. He got off the plane and was driven straight to the restaurant where he walked past the now fired GM on his way in the door. That's when Steve got told he was the new GM, and don't screw the servers.\n\nSame company, one of my GM's hooked up with one of our married female servers. I think basically only \"we\" in the in crowd knew so he never got found out or fired. \n\nAnother place the assistant manager was screwing most of the waitresses. This is the only place where it was a problem for me. I was a floor server. The GM would be in charge on Friday nights and stick me in a not great section. Every weekend he'd say the same thing \"We'll get you in the good section tomorrow night.\" The problem was he bartended on Saturdays and the manager screwing the waitresses was in charge of the floor. Even if I got scheduled for a good section one of his hoes would tell him to put them in that section instead. It probably cost me at least $100 a weekend between both shifts over what other servers made. I didn't stay there long.",

Over the course of a few months leading up to it, a few of her ladies in her department realized that one of the other ladies was starting to go “out to lunch” every day and come in late most days from lunch. They brought their concerns to my mom and my mom had a few convos with her and thought that it would work. Nope. About two weeks after her conversation with the lady, one of her other office ladies comes back and says “okay, she was gone at lunch for over an hour and a half today, came back beyond disheveled and never said a word, and I’m concerned” \n\nWell it turns out, that day she was gone so long.... she was meeting with a man in the company garage and hooking up in his big ol suburban during her lunch hour. Security guys caught her. She was caught on camera that day going into the back of his car, him following and then both coming out fixing clothes and he leaves and she comes back in. \n\nSecurity guys bring the info to my mom and multiple other days of her doing the same thing in the company garage or leaving and coming back. My moms company is run by a Catholic group who manages a few hospitals nationwide so things like this are fireable offenses if you know what I mean. And well, let’s see, she was fired that day for breaking the morality clause and being late all the time. \n\nThe best part about the whole story? She’s married... but not to him! Her husband is a really short, pale skinny guy and this guy was the COMPLETE opposite of that a tall, dark skinned big guy. Well she’s now divorced and no longer in the state :/ \n\nEnjoy.",

She says so and goes by and Im just like \"ok!\" A minute goes by and I hear yelling. Im busy helping a few customers so I don't do anything for a minute. I get asked to watch a table which I have not done once or been asked to do before so Im like \"What? What the hell is happening back there?\" I barge through the kitchen door and a waitress is falling on me! The wife is wailing crying. She apparently pushed the waitress that fell into me. The waitress is also red faced and silent. The guy is yelling. And everything is just loud and awkward. So I step in to break things up, I yell \"Its 6 am! I don't know about you guys but Im trying to make money!\" And I walk out. One good kid laughed really hard at me saying that. You kind of had to be there, but the whole thing is still awkward. Note: everyone is speaking in spanish and I still have no idea what's really happening. More yelling can be heard from a distance. I wait tables for the first time ever. Those people left through a back door and I didn't see'em the rest of the day.\n\nI heard about everything later sitting down with my manager. The guy was making out with the waitress in a storage room and grabbing ass. Wife caught them. Another waitress apparently was also sleeping with that guy too. Somehow the manager knew. That made me laugh. I asked him \"So who was fired?\" He was like \"No, I can't afford that.\" I go. \"Well then Im putting my two weeks in because Im not going through that shit at 6am.\" And then worked a 16 hour shift to cover someone and make up for putting the manager in a shit mood after that.

You were able to see everything within the store from the street.  At night, it was a different story since it was so dark outside.  \n\nOne of the stores had an interior alarm system that would flash red every 3-5 seconds.  When I was walking back, I saw a silhouette of a dude bending a chick over the checkout counter and viciously pounding her ass.  Shirt off, pulling her hair and flexing at his reflection like Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.  Initially, I didn't think much of it since it was less than a half-second of red visibility within the store.  \n\nI’m fucking hammered, did a double-take, turned around and banged on the glass while making the jack-off-hand motion.  Just for a laugh with my friends.  Perfect timing, by the way, since Patrick was looking at his reflection, I was making direct eye contact with a complete stranger busting an OG Mudbone sized nut, his eye's rolled back in his head like he's possessed, roaring like a howler monkey, and bearing his fangs like a territorial baboon.  It was like the low-budget, porn version of American Horror Story mixed with National Geographic.  We're just missing a narration from David Attenborough.  This was a small ass store, so from the glass, I'm standing like 5-10 feet away from this fucking couple.  When you're dying, they say your life flashes before your eyes.  You might see your parents, current or old lovers, your kids or siblings.  I'm going to see this guy's twisted, orgasm face, only the whites of his eyes exposed under red illumination then go down for the big nap.  That's how scarring and vivid the memory is. \n\nI’m not gay, but it was hands down the gayest thing that ever happened to me.  The chick was so pissed but the guy was laughing.  I’ve never been a fan of fucking in public cause I don’t want to get caught with my pants literally around my ankles, but honestly mad respect for that guy. \n\nThey thought they were able to see everyone walking around but people were unable to see into the store at night.

We were usually pretty busy. When I started working there I got messed with quite a bit. I was the only white dude, everyone else was Hispanic. Nothing new, I was one of four white kids in the small town I grew up in.  So after a few months I had to get something out of the giant walk-in freezer. Not sure why but this freezer had two doors, one on each side of the walk-in. You could pad lock the inside of the freezer on the inside of the door we used. No idea why this was, it was never locked, but the latch was there.  When I tried to open the door, it seemed stuck, so I pushed harder. They must have put a stick or something in that latch, because I broke it and the door shot open. I saw the manager (woman who was married, and her husband was friends with half the staff) screwing this douchebag of a shift lead.  He was one of the main dudes who messed with me.  I closed the door and walked straight to this small area where you could take a break. They both quickly showed up and began pleading to not say anything. She offered to pay me for shifts I didn't have to work and a bunch of other stuff. I didn't take her up on that but I did keep working there for about a year after. It was the easiest chill job after that. No one messed with me, I didn't have any shitty schedules.",

He would go out with girls other places and bring them back to the club so he could go have sex in the store room. He was married so he could not bring them home. One night when we were winding down I had one of the other bartenders watch the bar while I went in the bathroom and had sex with a girl I had met at the club. A couple of days later it got back to the owner what had happened and he angrily confronted me about it when I came in to work one day. I told him that I would make him a deal, when he got rid of the sex storage room then I would take him seriously when he told me that we were not allowed to have sex in the club. He was mad at me about it, but that was the end of that conversation. \n\n The service industry can be crazy",

One Monday morning, we all settle in and start our day, plugging away. I'm working on a couple projects and resolving tier 3 support calls (basically at the software engineering level).   \nWhile working, an email came in to me from someone in the company that I don't know, with no subject line. I open it up and begin to read it.  \nIt's a 400-500 word run-on sentence, written as if someone was dictating by voice to the computer. It was a detailed explanation of lurid sexual encounters that this person was having with multiple security personnel of the building. As I'm reading it, and struggling to do so because it was a massive thoughtstream in a single sentence, I pause to notice how quiet our open plan office space is.   \nDead quiet.   \nI check the CC line. It's everyone in the company. And all the distribution mailing lists. Those include people OUTSIDE our company. We are talking about over 10,000 recipients.  \nAs people hit the juicy parts, you hear the reactions go off. Looking back, you could score a reading comprehension test using this methodology of explicit content and measuring the auditory response of shock.   \nI, of course, was chatting with my cube neighbor meerkats about the email, and my phone rings. The IT equivalent of North Korea's supreme leader of IT is on the phone and says.  \n\"Have you read your email?\"  \n\"Yeah\" , I say, holding back a chuckle.  \n\"Delete that message that went out\", and hung up.  \nSo I get to work with a hastily formed damage control team. We hear rumblings of what happened over the next hour.  \nApparently  office worker A was very unhappy that  office worker B had moved in on her security guard love interest. A office worker C caused a distraction to lure the B from their desk, leaving their computer unlocked, allowing A to craft this email and sent to everyone from B's account. When B found out, they had to be taken away on a stretcher (no confirmation on this).\n\nSo damage control was far and wide, but none the less, taken care of. All three were let go because of how their actions violated a number of policies around use of electronic mail, productivity impact, and mayhem.    \nFor weeks after, I would find that message again, in the mailbox of a system account that somehow evaded my discovery, and I'd get to read it again, or at least try to, and recall how that day turned my hair gray.",

Has anyone seen her?\" and same thing going on with the other guy. Busy place but it was not normal for people to walk around confused about where another person was. They were nowhere to be seen inside the office from what I understood, and then just apparently returned 40 minutes later and didn't have much of an excuse.\n\nLike, meetings were arranged all the time, it's possible they were just doing meetings, but I think body-language says a lot. I mean, she was easily the most shined up of the female bosses there, in her late thirties and he was in his early thirties, a very young, nifty looking guy in great shape. There was something about the way she walked when she left to go whatever business she had with him that I noticed. Kinda head and eyes down, self-conscious. Seemed out of her normal self, and then that's what would happen before someone would end up going \"Where did she go?\"\n\nI was only there for 3 months. I mean, she was a family wife with 3 kids. It might becomplete fantasy on my part, but I know that he is no  longer employed there xD Dunno about her.\n\nAnd I don't judge, if it was a thing, even though it's infidelity on her part.

My girlfriend, at the time, had come out with some friends and hung around until last call.

My GF was wearing a short, navy blue denim dress, so she didn't even have to take anything but her panties off. We immediately got into it and there was always an extra element of hotness involved in these moments, knowing people were just outside the door. Well, it wasn't long before her friends began looking for her and my co-workers gladly brought them back to the office. The door was locked, but everybody knew what was going on anyway. Unbeknownst to me, there was a tiny peephole someone had fashioned right beside the office dropbox. So, here we are, going at while everyone else in the bar -- roughly eight others -- takes a turn (or two) watching essentially our live sex show. Eventually my bartender buddy, who was also a singer with a particularly deep & recognizable voice, made a comment about something I was specifically doing at that moment, and we both realized they could see us. Frantically, we tried to wrap things up. She finished a split second before I did and, when she pulled away, I accidentally unloaded onto her dress a la Bill Clinton in the White House. We did our best to clean off the stains, but there was still a pretty clear & present spot on the right breast area of her dress. From that night on, my girlfriend became known as \"Lewinsky\" among those who were there that night ... and those who heard the story secondhand.

You are a bunch of 20 somethings in charge of providing a load of other 20 somethings with ridiculous amounts of booze while also being trusted not to consume any of that booze yourself while working. Now of course being a bunch of young idiots you flagrant the rule, and get drunk enough to make the work bareable, while not being too drunk that you stumble about like Bambi on ice.\n\nBut another key factor is often you have a mixed workforce, usually 50/50 men to women. And I tell you when you’re around these girls for long enough and they’re around you long enough, there are certain mutual urges. \n\nTo cut a long story short, myself and a girl at this club had been hooking up regularly after work, we’d spend the day being amicable co workers, then second our shifts ended we’d gander off to hers to do the nasty all without telling a soul at work. \n\nBut then one day it was my birthday and oh Lordy it was a mental one. We decided after a shift we felt like having a bit of fun, take a risk maybe. We started by getting drunker than we usually would on a shift (yeah had to work on my birthday what a load of ass). Once that happened, and our young, dumb horny brains connected, we made our way over to the cloak room which wasn’t open to customers. Obviously we didn’t just start going at it there. There was a staircase at the back which lead to a storage area no one used. \n\nTo put it plainly, we were going at it for a while having a whale of a time, when suddenly we heard footprints coming up the stairs, and like a pair of morons we both froze, not knowing what to do. I was sort of hoping it would be one of our bar staff colleagues so this would just be a funny little anecdote we could laugh about....no such luck it was the bloody manager. \n\n*editors note: even before this incident, this manager was a nasty cow.\n\nThe manager entered the room with a look of pure horror mixed with confusion, and for five seconds not a word was said between anyone. To give a mental image, the lady friend and I were still *ehem* entangled, her being bent over a table and me standing there enjoying the ride as it were. Now I could’ve said anything at this point. I could’ve apologised, could’ve pulled up my jeans and I don’t know, pretended this manager was not seeing what she thought she was. But of course my drunk brain thinks he’s so fucking smart so I decided the most intelligent thing to say at the time was:\n\n“I know I’m probably fired......but can I finish up here at least”\n\nI did not get to finish up, and I was fired, the end.",

Coat check girl is gone for the night, pretty usual for the time of night, I go to grab the keys to open coat check door (which separates into the standard 2 halves) and top half where the doorknob is unlocks but won’t open, bolted shut with the latch from inside, odd right? As I open the bottom half up & swing it open to pop under we see two sets of legs, pants at ankles. The scrambling dance of those legs trying to hike up our distinctly bright orange bar pants & the high black dress socks of the manager is still one of the funniest things I’ve seen to this day. Thankfully the customer had a great sense of humor and laughed as well while patiently waiting for the pair to dress & awkwardly exit in shame while he continued to wait for the coat.",

I started out as a pharmacy tech at a very well known retailer starting with \"W\"  She was the pharmacist in charge and ultimately my boss. It all started out with me telling her that she appeared in a dream I had. Nothing sexual in the dream, but she was there nonetheless. So, she starts flirting and I reciprocated. 2 days later we're fucking in her Denali. 4 days later, I'm going for a run and she shows up to the trail I'm running on. 15 minutes later, we're at her house. Once we get into the house she strips her clothes off and is ready to get after it. Luckily, I was only a few minutes into the run, so I wasn't sweaty, gross or anything. We get to her bed, she asks me to put a finger in her ass and make her cum by going down on her. It was great. She then asked me to fuck her silly, which apparently I did. We got dressed, she dropped me off at my running trail and that was that... not so much. We would close the pharmacy and she knew where the cameras were, so she grabbed my hand and i inserted a finger inside of her. She pulled mybjand out when a customer approached and sucked every last drop of moisture on it. It was super hot. A few days later, I quit and a few years later she was busted for pilfering benzos and percs. 10/10 would do it again.",

He didn’t have anything happen to him because he had some dirt on the superintendent of the whole school district so he got off clean. I think he still works there.\n\n2. Brand new middle school (8th grade) math teacher fresh out of college started her first year teaching.

I worked as a cook in the restaurant there at the time and I was seeing one of the servers who worked in the lounge. \n\nThis girl was definitely a bit kinky, and used to like having sex in public places. I lived in an apartment building across the street from where I worked. One night after many cocktails. She decides we should go have sex in the elevator. I'm hammered and I'm not about to say no to that request. After a few minutes she then gets the idea that we should have sex in our restaurant which has been closed now for about 2 hours. \n\nNormally. I don't think I would have obliged as I really liked my job, but I was super horny by this point so hesitantly agreed. We went in to the lobby, and started to chat with the gentleman at the front desk. We have a good rapport with him as I live across the street and drink at the lounge upstairs frequently besides working there. I tell him I'm pretty drunk and forgot my keys in the staff lockers. He let's us go through. \n\nWe quickly make our way to the prep area and start going at it. This isn't super comfy and is like really easy to see if anyone was to come in so we move to the wine cellar just outside the kitchen. It's sort of a semi private room for large parties. I had her bent over a booth when we hear someone coming through the restaurant. We quickly ran and ducked behind the expo line and slowly worked our way around the outer edge of the restaurant. It was the front desk worker who came and grabbed a drink from the fountain machine clearly checking to see what was taking so long. I have no doubt he saw us drunkenly trying to sneak back through the restaurant. \nWe thought we were so slick at the time. \n\nAbout a month later my GF heard a rumor that came back to her that someone had had sex in the wine cellar after close. We ended up confronting front desk guy, and it turns out there is a security camera that has a view of the whole wine cellar. This dude never ratted us out, but he did tell a few hotel staff that someone had boned in the wine cellar. I figure he was entitled to our sex tape for that. Side note he ended up getting really weird with my ex after we broke up. Trying to get her number and continuously asking her out.\n\nAww man to be young again.",

There was a regular female passenger, who would often turn up in the evening  half an hour early for her train. Because it was relatively quiet at this time, the two of them went into the old parcels office to do the deed. The station master happened to have turned up, to take care of some urgent paperwork, and stumbled across the two of them in the parcels office. The assistant didnt lose his job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt a fast food restaurant in Adelaide (restaurant is similar to McDonalds, but isnt McDonalds), there was a young couple who would often be rostered on together (both in their late teens). One Friday night, after weeks of hitting on her, she eventually agreed to his advances. They went at it in the food prep area, after the restaurant had closed for the night. They didnt have a condom, she didnt want him to cum inside her, so when it came to the climactic moment, the guy looked for anything...and eventually released his load...into a tub of mayonnaise. They got found out because several things were not quite right with how they left the store that night, and the manager the following morning looked at the cameras to work out why. Both were instantly fired.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is the story of the butcher for the major supermarket chain, who was knocked back by the female staff so often, that he decided to do something one evening with a beef carcass hanging in the coolroom. He would have gotten away with it, if it wasnt for the duty manager walking in looking for some trays of meat for a customer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe best one by far, would have to be at my old high school. A Catholic high school too. Most teachers would come to the school, and last a good three or four years at least (often more), before moving on to another school. We had teachers there who had been there for at least 10 years. Anyway, when I was in Year 8, we got a crop of new teachers...a young female music teacher, a young female art teacher, a youngish male phys ed teacher, a youngish male business/economics teacher, a young female history teacher, a young female science teacher, and a young female home ec teacher. By the end of the year, the only teachers that remained were the young female science teacher, and the youngish male business/economics teacher. The young female art teacher was rumoured to have had sex with a number of Year 12 male students, one of which bragged in front of the wife of the school principal without even knowing. No proof of course, but she was encouraged to leave. The young female music teacher was rumoured to have been given the sack over lurid photos of her being sent to the young female science teacher. The youngish male phys/ed teacher and the young home ec teacher, were fired because of an incident similar to what happened to the two gym teachers in the movie \"Porkys\". And the youngish female history teacher was caught in the backstage area of the school hall, with one of the male janitors, supposedly with a broomstick you know where.",

I was out of a pretty bad relationship but was together enough to just be foot loose and fancy free.\n\nWe randomly happened across each other at a bar, she was with her girlfriends and she started off about how screwed up work was and what a dickhead our general manager was. We got drunker and flirtier. Nothing happened that night, but it certainly did maybe a week later. After a little awkward avoiding each other at work, one evening I had to work late and she hung around to make sure all was up and running. Cue a bit of a dalliance that lasted about three months.\n\nThe office Christmas party came up and lo and behold, I had to finish something for a client. Long story short, we ended up going at it in her office. In fairness I did start it, thought it would be funny to walk around with my cock out and things escalated. Anyway, we were going at it in her office over the desk and taking advantage of the risky but know we're alone time, but the fact that the company was two floors up kept the risky factor. Anyway at some point, we heard voices. We realised we were a bit too late to do anything. She jumped down behind her desk to hide. I was too late and there was nowhere else to really hide. Instead I grabbed the nearest thing to cover my modesty which was her computer keyboard. I just sort of held it in front of me just as the inevitable happened.\n\nThe GM was giving his wife a quick tour of the office and as her office was fairly close to the entrance, the first thing they saw was me, starkers with only a computer keyboard in front of me, trying to look in some way dignified.\n\nThey approached, stood at the open door. However my boss' clothes were all over the place. It took them a second to figure what was going on and turned and left. \n\nI think we were both freaking a little, pretty sure we were fired. Lo and behold about a week later, I was in the office quite early only to see the secretary coming out of the shower room. She looked at me oddly and went off to her office and about a minute later, the GM appeared. Well it doesn't take a genius. \n\nI think that little factoid meant my boss' job was fine, but my contract didn't get renewed. \n\nFor the rest of that remaining month on my contract, my boss and I didn't have sex again nor did we speak much. Shame really as she was kinda cute. On my last day, a bunch of us went out for leaving drinks. At about 10pm, saw that my boss had texted me her address. I got a cab over there and went at it again. We dated for about half a year after that incident, but she had this mad worry that her boss had seen her boobs and was a little unnerved by it. I just assured her that the GM and his wife were far more interested in my hiding myself with a keyboard and that she was safely and securely hidden down behind the desk. \n\nI kept playing with her, telling her to tell me when she was working late next and I'd swing by. I was joking of course and she knew that!",

Cold demeanor, very demanding and generally didn't get along with pretty much everyone. However for some reason she was really into me, never calling me by my name, always saying \"hi handsome\", complimenting me all the fucking time and trying to get a bit more touchy every time she got. I've been hit on before, but she was something else. Long story short, I developed a huge crush on her, even if I was a little bit intimidated at first, and we eventually got together. \n\nSo at one point I was doing internal medicine rotations and had a night shift(students never slept on the hospital though, they could leave after 11pm or so, when the last bus left). She also happened to be the psychiatry resident on night duty that night. It was a slow night, well for psychiatrists it was most of the time a slow night. Around 10pm before I took the last bus to the city, she texted me that she wanted to fuck and waited for me in the room the resident stays. Naturally I accepted. We did the deed and everything was dandy. No harm no foul.\n\nOur mistake was that we got pretty bold afterwards and we tried to repeat the exact same thing the next week. Door was unlocked and she was riding me hard. Suddenly the door opens, a male nurse in his early 40s appears and shouts \"well at least someone is getting some action here\"(paraphrasing since it was in my native language) and shuts the door. We were both embarrassed and anxious as fuck, her more than me of course, because she could potentially get reported. Apparently the neurologists upstairs were looking for her. She left and I stayed with my boner. That same nurse later that night pulls me to the side and tells me(paraphrasing again) \"I'll be silent as a grave, man. Thank god someone is tapping that, perhaps now she'll stop being such a bitch.\" He was a pretty cool dude.\n\nAs far as we know, he never told anyone and there were absolutely no problems at work for my girl, she finished her residency just fine.",

Late as I was I still decided to show up. I was off from work that day and I actually liked my English IV teacher. Well. I walked into the room looking down not paying attention saying \"my bad Ms. ___ I was in a meeting with the organization about the fundraisers we needed for the co-\". As I looked up I was looking at two frozen people... I backed out of the room closed the door and didn't say anything. She tried to get me to stay after class a few times to explain. Never did. Two weeks later his daughter came reaming down the halls \"You cheated on mom!? You cheated on mom with Ms. ___\" nothing happened. His wife divorced him. But other than that. The school took no action or anything. It was swept under the rug.",
