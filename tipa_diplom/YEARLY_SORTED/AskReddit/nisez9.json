This is something that happened to me when I was 19, next year will be ten years.\n\nThis guy told me to lay on the bed because he would give me a massage. I did not ask for one and didn‚Äôt want one. I told him he didn‚Äôt have to do that. This was my first time somewhat alone with a male before because I didn‚Äôt have guy friends growing up and I just never had any guy like me. He just said, ‚ÄúSeriously, get on the bed I‚Äôll give you a massage.‚Äù\n\nHe told me he would have to get on top of me if that was okay. And I said, sure but I didn‚Äôt think anything of this. I thought ‚Äúoh wow, that‚Äôs nice especially because nobody would ever touch me. What a nice person.‚Äù\n\nThen he immediately flipped over and took his shirt off and said, ‚ÄúMy turn‚Äù. I never gave a massage to a boy before, only him up until this day. My mom and grandma would ask for neck massages when they felt pain but that‚Äôs it. Then he says I could get on top of him and I told him I didn‚Äôt really know what to do but he just kept saying it felt good. Once it stopped, we just laid side by side and he kept staring at me and nudging my foot with his. But the thing is this man told me I was not pretty. It is a very long story but he basically seduced me despite being vocal about not finding me very pretty or attractive physically.\n\nSometimes, I wish I was never born. That situation caused a lot of mental damage. It turned into oral sex because he pulled himself out of his pants and kept saying, ‚Äúyou can touch it if you want to.‚Äù And I really liked him. I wasn‚Äôt afraid but I was curious and also just shocked. Someone not finding you attractive and then being in that position with them was confusing. \n\nHe was my first kiss and he just got naked, I had my clothes on. I‚Äôm curious to know if this circumstance was a result of being used and manipulated or was it more so just someone using another person just out of boredom? Neither option is ideal. He also ignored me a month after and wouldn‚Äôt say hello online or anything. So after I started making hate pages of myself to\nCope with this. He also told people that I stalked him.",

If you‚Äôre a man, be calm, smile and make a female feel safe. If she smiles back, thats not a green light. Be respectful. If the smile was a green light, engage slowly. Make eye contact and dont be creepy or sleezy. Keep the conversation simple. Don‚Äôt tell them your life story in one sitting. Remember, you have years to talk if it works out. If you‚Äôre a female, you have more power than you know, yet with that power comes great fear when signals get crossed.  One wrong smile or gaze could attract the wrong guy inadvertently. Its a tough thing to gauge all the little nuances or vibes the opposite sex gives off, process the information, then reply correctly, appropriately, in real time and on time. If you don‚Äôt have the experience, make the experience. Don‚Äôt force it just be comfortable around it and you‚Äôll figure it out.",

I'm aware I'm a dude and wouldn't want to step outside my lane by perhaps making a woman feel uncomfortable with physical contact. Some women hate a touchy guy.

Saying something witty or just generally being more outspoken and clearly WANTING to keep up a conversation with you.\n\nThey may even blush a little if your look them in the eye and smile at them (this still works with masks on, because if you're smile meats your eyes they can tell you're smiling).\n\nPay attention to how they are with others vs how they are with you. You can definitely tell.\n\nIf they say something self depreciating, but with confidence, they are looking for you to correct them. They want the compliment. Here's an example: I was talking to my coworker and told her \"I told you not to look at the mugs, V. You break fragile things.\" Random woman: \"it happens to me all the time\" me: \"that's because they were just getting weak because they saw a cute girl.\" Customer: üò≥\n\nWhen she did come check out with me, she kept her eyes on me the entire time. She was very talkative with me, even though I had a massive line, and she even asked me how I liked my coffee. \n\nIf they bring you bring you coffee, without bringing anyone else coffee, then they probably like you.\n\nTrust me: people who like you will be aware of your presence, and their eyes will follow you subconsciously. They will pay special attention to you in some format. They might even blush a little or make an attempt to be extra talkative with you, or talk about about your to their friends. They will laugh and smile when you're being obviously silly or saying something only vaguely funny. If they touch you when it's unnecessary to do so.",

            "text": "So I‚Äôm one of those people who can flirt comfortably with just about anyone in just about any situation.\n\nMy friends like to joke that I‚Äôm the only guy they‚Äôve ever seen who can flirt with a woman in front of her husband & have him be happy about it.\n\nBut a lot of being able to do that is to put yourself in the right frame of mind, keep yourself within certain boundaries unless you‚Äôre invited to go further.\n\nFor me it starts with divorcing the flirting from any specific goal or desire - flirting is the goal in & by itself & while I may or may not be open to taking things further, I am not working an agenda.\n\nI‚Äôm a social flirt, I don‚Äôt use flirting to hook up (*although it occasionally results in offers*). I use flirting as social lubricant, as a fun way to pass time & as a way to draw people in, especially in a group setting if I notice one person is a bit withdrawn.\n\nUse your attention & flirtation with purpose, & make people feel good about being around you but avoid flattery or compliments.\n\nIt is far better to demonstrate that you are present, engaged & paying attention - you‚Äôd be surprised how rarely people are actually any of those things & honestly, that is one of the most genuine & meaningful compliments you can give a person anyway.\n\nNext it is to keep things playful & light, don‚Äôt try to be the ‚Äú*cool*‚Äù or ‚Äú*sexy*‚Äù flirt (*unless you have gauged the situation & people involved & can pull it off*) - use relational humor & toss in the occasional self-deprecating remark - but don‚Äôt over do it - you don‚Äôt want to come off like you‚Äôre flagellating yourself on the altar of the unworthy.\n\nSo just enough to show that you don‚Äôt take yourself to seriously & have the confidence to poke fun at yourself.\n\n* Hear what they say\n* Listen to their tone\n* Observe their body language\n\n& most importantly - create space for them to come forward & occupy as a participant rather than a recipient of your flirting.\n\nThat way it becomes y‚Äôall flirting together instead of you flirting with them.\n\nIt also gives them an out, sometimes a person might want an out because aren‚Äôt into the interaction & sometimes they‚Äôll be enjoying it but have something else they need to attend to.\n\nIn either case, people will remember you more positively if you give them an easy out & more negatively if you don‚Äôt.\n\nAlso, don‚Äôt overly focus on one person - social flirtation is about the environment as much as the experience- if you can be that person at a party who is moving about, livening up a conversation here, maybe rescuing someone who is cornered over there (*it is always a lot easier to recognize a cornered person when you aren‚Äôt the one making them feel cornered*) & it not only gives the person a moment to reflect on your interaction but if your lucky, the next person they mingle with may just inspire them to find out where you wandered off to.\n\nThe other benefits of mingling openly is that it demonstrates social value, a contribution to the group & most importantly, if they see you as being a generally outgoing person & being broadly social, they are likely to drop their guard & engage with you on a more real level.\n\nFlirting is **not** hitting on, people far too often conflate the two, & seeing you hitting on everything that moves will have the opposite affect on most people.\n\nI‚Äôve also noticed that a fair amount of the time, by giving them an out, or giving them space to come forward into the interaction - someone that I thought might be losing interest will decide to jump in with both feet - but the key there is that you gave them the choice.\n\nUnderstand your environment, who you are flirting with & respect norms & boundaries.\n\nIf I‚Äôm flirting with a married woman, I‚Äôm going to bring up her relationship &/or her partner regularly & in a respectful way so that she knows (*& he can observe if he is nearby*) that I do not have any untoward intentions.\n\nIt can be a tricky line - god knows I had it blow up in my face more than a few times when I was younger (*on one hilarious occasion, I excused myself to the bathroom & had the couple follow me thinking that I was propose a liaison in the loo*). So if you‚Äôre new to flirting, stay away from the minefields until you are sure that you know how to dance.\n\nI‚Äôm sure some of you are thinking - but if I just keep it light & social how will they know I‚Äôm interested & not just being polite or friendly.\n\nWell, I‚Äôve noticed that when you are present, engaging, & enjoyable to be with, people tend to open themselves up to connection - whether friendship or romantic - in my experience the trick is not to let them go too long wondering which before you clue them into your intentions.\n\nTo some extent, just exchanging time & attention (*notice I didn‚Äôt say giving them your times & attention - remember it is a path y‚Äôall walk together not something you are inflicting on them*) will do a lot of the heavy lifting.\n\nBut if I‚Äôm actually interested in someone & I‚Äôve done my due diligence to ensure that they are both single & of an appropriate sexual orientation then I find that short, simple & to the point is often best.\n\nThe vast majority of the times I flirt with people it goes nowhere & that is great because I just had a lovely time laughing & connecting with someone.\n\nThe number of times that I have friends say something absurd like \n\n‚Äú*Wow, they seemed really into you, are you going to go out with them?*‚Äù\n\nWhen neither I nor the other party (*usually*) has any romantic intentions simply because by flirting in a genial, collaborative manner simply allowed us to both let our guards down, connect as people, & just enjoy that interaction for what is without trying to force it into being something more.\n\nThe rare times I actually meet someone that I am really interested in as a person (*not just as an emotional balm*) I‚Äôm comfortable engaging with them without pretext or pretense & when the time comes, express my interest without apprehension & accept their response with dignity & grace.\n\nOh & one last thing - If I am actually interested in someone, I always make a point of letting them know no later than the end of the first event when we have an interaction of substance.\n\nIn my experience, putting it off, never works in your favor.",

When you talk to her you have to slightly touch her on the arm as a sign that you're interested.\n\nLike if you make a joke, lightly tap her on the arm to get a reaction.\n\nYou have to eventually escalate the conversation.

They *literally* get paid to seem interested in the concerns of every customer/client. Furthermore, any of these one signs alone is NOT confirmation someone likes you. Everyone flirts differently and some may not even use any of the above. These were simply some traits that came to mind based off my limited experience. I have never been an expert at reading signals (I was always shy), but I think the most important aspect of flirting is demonstrating that you take a *keen* interest in the other person and want as much one-on-one time to get to know them better as a person. Some people will rush the sexual aspect of dating, at which point their flirtations become more physical and obvious. But for most dating adults, signals are more subtle and revealed through conversation.",

Everyone says to look for eye contact, look at posture, look for mimicry, etc, and sure there's some truth to that but no one should be expected to keep track of all of those things and not everyone exhibits any particular one.\n\nIn my experience, almost everyone can get a sense that someone is into them, but most people second guess themselves until they convince themselves it's nothing. I say trust that sense. It's based off all of these factors that we pick up consciously and subconsciously, and almost always it's not a coincidence. \n\nWhen you think someone likes you, you can test that theory in a few ways. A subtle but effective example is inviting them to something you know they can't or don't want to attend. If they express interest in rescheduling or finding some other way to spend time with you, they like you. Otherwise they'll just say no, sorry I can't make it. This works because you're showing interest in spending additional time with them (this event would be more enjoyable for me if you where there) and if they like you they will be sure to make it clear that they are saying no to the event, not to you.\n\nOf course, you could also just ask.

That's the whole point. Plausible deniability. They can safely disengage at any time.\n\nIf you want to know if someone's flirting, you need to test it. You do that by escalating things, but just a bit, so that now *you* have plausible deniability (touch them back in a comfortable way, maintain eye contact, or joke-compliment them back). If they escalate back and continue to do so as you escalate in turn, that is flirting. Eventually one of you will break cover and do something with clear intent (a kiss, an approach + ask for a number, or straight up telling them what you think of them and that you're interested). Otherwise, if you escalate and they don't change their behavior or they back off, then they were probably just being friendly and you should take the hint and do the same.\n\nDunno if that's something obvious to people, but it was definitely not for me, and college parties would have been way less fun had i not known.

I'm determined not to miss it again.\n\nAnd by \"isolating herself\" I don't mean an awkward date. I mean you constantly find her showing up when you are somewhere out of view of others. Like she is watching for the opportunity and jumping on it, or she wants you to go somewhere isolated with her at a group event. \n\nExample, at a bar to watch a friend's band, a little before everyone else is ready to go, she asks you for a ride to the next location (a house). When you get there she sits in your lap. \n\nExample two, you are coworkers. She follows you into your office and puts her feet in your lap. She plays with your hair. \n\nExample three, at a bonfire, she jumps on your back and says y'all should go over behind the barn where no one else is. \n\nFour, after her roommates go to bed, she wants to exchange massages and she goes first and it's more sensual than your average shoulder rub.\n\nBeware, should you find yourself in these situations, you will be tempted to list the reasons why you don't think she is actually into you. Just go for it. If she isn't into you, then she will stop you and tell you. That means she trusts you to respect her, don't break that trust, move on. As long as you respect her, the friendship will survive as long as it is a healthy one. If it isn't healthy, then you are better off looking for other friends. \n\nSide note, if you are trying to figure out if someone was flirting with you and you missed it. Imagine someone you are really unattracted to behaving the same way towards you, if you would feel uncomfortable and feel the need to \"shut them down\" or take the situation elsewhere, then there is a good chance they were flirting. (and I mean you gotta find them sexually repulsive, as harsh as that sounds, this only works if it's someone you wouldn't touch if they were the last person on earth. Maybe if you are completely gay, think of the opposite sex; completely straight, the same sex.)",

So assuming you're not too ugly and not an asshole (+10 points if you're actually funny) start off by talking to them as you'd do with any other person you're trying to befriend, don't treat them differently at the start because that can come off as that the only reason you're trying to pass as friendly is to fuck them, and that's a no no. This is also important because if they feel they are being treated equally they'll find they can trust you to be genuine, and you need them to fall for who YOU are, not what you're trying to be to get in those pants. Once we're at the step where you're friends I start making moves, real subtle ones, ones that could come off as someone being a tad too friendly, but that gets the ball rolling, now they're thinking \"why\" you did it, and if it meant anything. These moves are not here to give hints to them, but rather they are hints to yourself, take a look at their reactions, if they are positive well next time you can try a pushier approach, and by positive I don't mean polite. Take it slow, bit by bit, slowly but surely working up the hints to be more and more obvious with more and more positive reactions, so that when you finally take the leap you already know the answer. This is obviously if you're trying to have a relationship, not like a fling, you'd need to work way faster if you only got one night. For one night stands what I do is dress nicely, get something that can make me stand out like a funny tie or hat so that I look quirky and approachable, smell nice, have/fake confidence (telling ya fake it till you make it is 100% real), make eye contact, smile, be funny, be touchy to show I'm interested and then fucking PRAY that they chose you too. If at any point they seem uncomfortable or not willing just back off and take the L, you don't wanna be the guy that keeps on insisting, that's how you get people NOT to like you, a swing and a miss is just a rejection, no big deal no one will care",

I think that you can pick up on people's energy when they are pushing it your way. Like in the way that you can sometimes feel tension between people. But sexual/interested energy is very complicated and is felt differently for everyone. It comes down to understanding that person to pick up on their energy correctly. Being direct is the best approach but that's really hard. In the end, that's the most definitive way to get your answer. But first try understanding their different energy outputs to see if there might be something there. Watch how they behave around others and then around yourself and note the differences. Sounds almost stalker-ish but humans are pattern recognition MACHINES and by looking at patterns, you can come to understand things a lot better.

Fast forward 3 months she's across the entire state saying she was lonely so I messaged her and as we were talking I spring the question of whether she wanted to get some coffee with me. She was doing college things so she thought the next time this would happen was in November, like 4 months from then, to which I said great I like to drive I can be there this weekend. 300 miles. Half a stranger and I drove 300 miles to go see her. That is the worst idea ever, it is so God damned unsafe that if my child did that I would half consider grounding him for the rest of his life. Anyways it worked out alright and we've already beat out the average for marriages so should be pretty good.\n\nThe real reason why I can't actually talk with any kind of authority comes before my wife. I was working at a gas station with a bisexual lady and another lady who was apparently either over her boyfriend or in an open relationship. So bisexual lady left her boyfriend a couple weeks before and is in complaining about relationships, and then the next thing I know the other lady is propositioning me and the bisexual lady for a threesome. Went right over my head. I was so hung up on the fact that the not bisexual lady was already with someone that I completely missed realizing that they were both actually serious about it. I'm kind of okay with missing this opportunity, I don't think I would have been able to take them up on it and also stay emotionally sound afterwards. That being said I don't think I've ever missed such a heavy handed attempt at flirting before or since.",

If she does, she could be interested. Take the hint. Distance is the first ingredient to flirting, and the first chance she has to either a) close the gap and make it obvious she wants you to approach, or b) increase the distance and preclude that from happening.\n\n2 - Eye contact. If she looks at you and holds it, or makes contact multiple times, take the cue. She isn‚Äôt doing that just for fun; she wants you to take the bait. \n\n3 - During conversation, her body language is actually doing the most talking. Is she turned towards you? Looking into your eyes? Smiling? Playing with her hair? All good signs.\n\n4 - Women are very socially in-tune, and make most of their suggestions with hints or clues. Very rarely will they say ‚Äútake me home and fuck me.‚Äù What they might say is ‚Äúdo you have any roommates?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you live close to here?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry.‚Äù ‚ÄúCan you walk me to (my car/my place/etc.)?‚Äù Read between the lines gentlemen: they are dropping major hints left and right. Hungry? Let‚Äôs get a bite together. Of course I can walk you home, can I use your bathroom when we get there/grab a glass of water/etc.? Of course I live close to here/it‚Äôs a close Uber ride/etc. I have roommates but they‚Äôre gone tonight/I do have roommates, do you?\n\n5 - Does she make up silly reasons to talk to you? Does she ask for help doing things she could totally do herself? Take. The. Hint.\n\n6 - Does she have a nickname for you? She likes you. Give her one back. Take the hint. Flirt.\n\n7 - Does she smile or laugh when you say unfunny things? Take the hint.\n\nBottom line, a lot of ‚Äúoblivious‚Äù people are just so sexually inexperienced or have such low confidence that they think there‚Äôs no chance the girl they‚Äôre talking to could want to have sex with them. Learn to pay attention to the signs, and you‚Äôll see you could very well be wrong! Best of luck.",

            "text": "I tend to be very flirty, even unintentionally. The last time someone asked for my number, it was because of the way I emphasized a word. I said \"it was a pleasure to meet you too\" but apparently I said the word \"pleasure\" in a specific way. \"It was a *pleasure.*..to meet you too.\" Caused the guy to stop in his tracks and ask for my number (he told me so).\n\nThe second one can be trying to play guessing games. Today a guy flirted with me by calling me cute. He asked me to guess how old he was (stay away from this question specifically with women) and I playfully paused, squinted my eyes and said \"hmm\" before taking a guess while we both smiled at each other. Then I take a flattering guess, he tells me the real answer and he can either tease me if I'm way off or I can have a celebratory moment if I get it right. \n\nBut people will play into their specific strengths as well. Mine is that I can play with the inflections in my voice so the way that I will say things is how I act flirty. It's really common to repeat a name back when hearing it for the first time, so if someone tells me their name I may say it back in a flirtatious way (which I did today unintentionally). He told his name was Manny, and I said it back \"MAANyy?\" and then quietly \"It's nice to meet you.\"\n\nOther people have different flirting styles and different ways they feel brave. Some may lean into physical touch (I can't stand being touched by strangers so I don't tend to use this one). Some are more sexy/suggestive. If all else fails, direct communication is the best way to let someone know you are interested so while missing cues can suck, people can't rely on hints forever either.",

While that's very important, over all body language encompasses the \"social cues\" question more so.  Little unisex/universal things like are thry leaning towards you or not, arms/legs crossed, adjusting hair/clothing because they are more self conscious around you (big indicator of attraction or lack there of), if it's a social gathering with friends then one should observe those interactions as well (in relation to you).  The list can go on and on. And in the end, these \"cues\" you're looking for can be moot as everyone shows attraction and love differently.  They're very general.  Your candidness in recognizing your own \"obliviousness\" is also very endearing.  I think that's the ultimate quality in good flirtation. Just being genuine, pure, vulnerable, with out giving an f. So to speak.  The irony about the flirt is that it's so much about social cues as it is about personal cues.  Do YOU feel comfortable? Are YOU in control of your emotions?  Are YOU being honest with yourself and them?  If there's a mutual trust then the rest becomes history.  Hope that helps!",

If you are in a group setting and asking directly if someone is flirting with you would be awkward, then ask via text if you have their number. If you don't have their number and you're interested enough to ask a friend, you are the one doing the flirting already. \n\nIf you aren't sure how to flirt yourself, the solution is not to wait for someone to do it for you. It is to reflect on what exactly you want out of a relationship (even a casual one) with someone and develop the courage to say it. If it seems too blunt a thing to say, then one of the things that you want is to have someone you can speak to without worrying overmuch about being misunderstood, and looking for that just in case the person wants to fuck is a bad idea.\n\nSpeaking, again, as an autistic person, virtually everyone does some form of \"masking\" in social situations, which is why some people are uncomfortable or caught off guard when asked directly about their feelings. The real secret is, a lot of people don't really know how to flirt, and it's not uncommon for people to *not realize that they are flirting.* People don't always think about what they want before they start looking for it. Hell, what some people want is a person they can spill their guts to so that person can tell *them* what they want. \n\nTL;DR It's all contextual. Add the phrase \"Are you flirting with me?\" to your vocabulary, and if you're actively on the lookout for people who might be flirting with you, you'll probably be able to identify situations where it's appropriate to ask. Note: a person answering \"no\" doesn't mean it wasn't good to ask.",

Some shy people will talk to you while facing at an angle to you with their arms folded, but the very fact that the conversation is still going might mean they like you. Other people can be touchy and smiley and have that sort of inviting look in their eyes, and even seem to act flirty, but be completely surprised and confused if you try to move things further.\n\nThe real key to flirting well is to show someone you are attracted to them, using body language and attitude more than specific words, without being creepy in any way.\n\nIt's about being confident and comfortable about yourself on the one hand while being very much focused on and in tune with the other person, with what they're feeling and what their body language and similar signs mean *for them as individuals*. It's about making them feel special without using flattery. In that state even a subtle faux pas is immediately obvious, and you can gradually get a better feeling for them and whether they're likely to be interested in you at all.\n\nBut the absolutely most important thing, especially for guys who aren't good at it yet, is to *not be desperate*.\n\nYou really have to get over and let go of the *need to get a date*. Paradoxically, that confidence and acceptance of negative outcomes is what makes you the most attractive and the least creepy.\n\nYou want the other person's thought process to be :\n\nAre they coming on to me? Nah, they're just friendly..... Hey this is nice..... Oh, I kind of like this person.\n\nEdit:\nMeanwhile, your thought pattern should be: hey I like this person, I wonder if there's anything? (talk to them) Do they seem to want to keep talking? Yes? Continue. No? Move on. Repeat.\n\nIncidentally, when you get better at it and put aside your needs, then you can pretty much flirt with anyone with no goal, that's real flirting, and it's really fun. Except when there are jealous partners around who feel intimidated by your casual confidence.",

If I‚Äôm not interested in someone, I‚Äôm very friendly but I won‚Äôt allow the touch barrier to be broken and i won‚Äôt try to keep the conversation going once the small talk has ended. Flirting is a dance of body language. Dance with the partner by exchanging moves...don‚Äôt continue making moves if they aren‚Äôt responding. Also, just because a girl is smiling and being friendly doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs flirting. If her arms are crossed or she doesn‚Äôt make any advancements to get closer to you (like readjusting in her seat to lean closer) then she‚Äôs most likely not flirting.",

That's the difference between partying with a D list celeb who's got you and your drinks for the night and his name on 3 club VIP lists, and you going home because you're nervous to hit him up.\n\nIt's not just romance, it's relationships, we all have different chemistry, it's part of why people cheat (and why polyamory is booming), and the energies we develop with different people is so nuanced and varied. I've met people who feel like they're my uncle. Or like we're brothers but we're 20 years about, yet we giggle and play video games like it's the same childhood we had. Or like you both know each other from somewhere but you can't ever remember where and you're actually positive you haven't met before but you fuck like you died doing so.\n\nThey don't all go so deep, but we do develop all these different relationships with different people and we often struggle when we try to treat the new like the old when it's not even the same language, sometimes it not even the same medium. You're talking about language and colors and dancing and you just can't communicate in one medium with the other, thats part of the vetting for compatibility.\n\nIt's also important to let the relationship develop you and to to know that \"Not everyone in your life is meant to be in it forever.\" You need to know that. You need to understand that some people are just meant to be in your life for 5 years, or 6 months, or a night, and that you need to get the most that you can from every interaction you have, because it might be the last you have with that person, and every interaction yields different results, especially when pushed to their peaks.\n\nThat's all folks üëã",

            "text": "I have a couple easy ways to spot someone is interested in you.\n\n One is what I call \"the ol up and down\" glance. A person who is attracted to you will glance curiously at your face the first time they meet you and then flit their eyes down at your body before quickly glancing back at your face and eyes. This is an instinctive bit of body language. When you first see an attractive person's face you think, usually a bit subconsciously \"wow arent they cute, I wonder if their body is just as attractive too...\" so you look down and do a quick overall scan before focusing on their face again. If you catch someone doing this, they're definitely checking you out. \n\nIf you like someone and you want to test the waters, I've found a fun trick is to actually lightheartedly joke about how attractive you are. It could be wearing something subtle but cute and pointing it out like \"I know this dress, isnt it magical?\" or something else. Do it with a little sense of humor and with a bit of innocence. \n\nI've had people stare hard enough that I've been a lot bolder and just said \"I know, I'm gorgeous isnt it great?\" Or other exaggerated self compliments because it broke the ice, but I generally would discourage going in that forward. But having a sense of humor about it makes people less uncomfortable and if they dont agree, they'll lean into the over the topness about it and just laugh it off that you're being goofy.\n\nIn the same vein you can make the opposite jokes about yourself. \"I'm such a goof I get lost in the parking lot\" and other jokes make you seem down to earth. Either way, infusing a bit of silliness will break the odd tension and make people more prone to being themselves. \n\nDont be heavily handedly sexual in any scenario where you're uncertain of where you stand. A better place to start is to focus on small details. You can point at that a person has cool sunglasses, or a sweet t-shirt, etc. Do. Not. Focus in on the body early off, its disconcerting, especially for women.\n\nTeasing is one of my best weapons. My teases range from just affectionately telling them they're a dork, ruffling their hair if they're comfortable, or saying something in a playful tone like \"Now why would you do that?\" To small mistakes. I've also liked to say in a  gentle light hearted voice \"oh my goodness\", feign an over the top gasp and \"well isnt that silly\" etc.\n\nIt's good to channel a certain fun, light hearted, warmth in these scenarios. It's okay to be in a more serious mood or be a more serious person in general but a sense of playfulness and loose energy really helps others relax.\n\nHot tip for guys: do not mention sex right off the bat, unless a hook up is your goal. I've literally never been less turned off than when a guy immediately starts talking about sexual positions, fetishes, and so on, on a first date. Horrible romantic strategy, makes you seem way too thirsty, off putting creepy af.\n\nAnother for guys: you can tell her she's attractive but DO NOT say it over and over and over again with no other way to hold the conversation. We get sick of it real fast when you wont even get to know us.\n\nI personally love a guy that is very thoughtful. He isnt heavy handedly rambling about porn, and sex, and how badly he wants me to be his girlfriend. He's cool but openly romantic. He calmly states that he's interested, that he wants to take you out, that he cares for you, etc. He doesnt pretend not to care for you, and he's not afraid to tell you he wants a relationship. He doesn't hide his feelings.\n\n\nI cannot stand people that arent honest about their feelings. Never lie to play it cool and act casual. I had a guy insist I couldnt see other men but wouldnt even admit he liked me. Dont be that guy. Nothing turns us on like being loved, wanted, admired, someone's day dream, etc. Don't ever lie about liking someone.",

This can at times be hard to read but many girls and some guys just laugh to be nice, polite or because they have no other response option. If you BLUNDER a comment, joke or even a genuine complement you know was a mistake and cringe internally at yourself and they laugh historically you need to slow down or give her/him some space. This is typically a laugh without comment. Replies like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs actually really funny, sweet, exciting etc you‚Äôre okay. An ‚ÄúI know right‚Äù is a balanced response you‚Äôre not getting anywhere but you haven‚Äôt lost her/him. \n\nSecond since I‚Äôve managed many bars: \nTruthfully many bartenders are just busy, they are working so don‚Äôt be insulted if they have to leave or ditch for a period of time and absolutely don‚Äôt hold it against them. Yes some only care about tip$ but a majority actually want you to have a positive experience. Use this to your advantage and find the people who care about others. \n\nFinally cats and dogs:\nThis might apply outside bartenders but Ignore the ‚Äúcats‚Äù (girl who only want things from you) and avoid chasing ‚Äúdogs‚Äù (a handsome/attractive guy who only wants ‚Äúit‚Äù). These types of people don‚Äôt sugar coat things, they will fake smiles, show cleavage or flash a devilish grin if they think you‚Äôre vulnerable. They often always use language that manipulates conversation. This is the opposite of having a one sided conversation but being one sided against if that makes sense. Also these two types don‚Äôt hide it. They‚Äôll talk about ideas like sex and the bedroom or ask question about your job and how much money you make. They are trying to attain information about you to see if they can benefit. These are industry terms so don‚Äôt take offense. I didn‚Äôt make these up. Also I‚Äôm not bisexual I just happen to be a confident guy and I know how guys think.\n\nOkay last last last thing:\nSince I mentioned confidence. It‚Äôs highly possible that you run into someone who is put off by your confidence. Either they feel overshadowed, intimidated or suffer from anxiety some people are confident for reasons like intellect, charisma or presence and like rock, paper and scissors these can be deflected by one another and work on one another.

Our specialty was cardiovascular; stents and stuff like that. We had a completely unrelated project at a casino. While we were drinking at this little club in the casino, I was doing pretty well with this one girl. There's absolutely no way I could've done what I did sober. She was a medical student specializing in cardiovascular medicine. Now, I don't have anything even resembling a degree in medicine, but I learned through our projects enough to talk to her about the field. I told her there was no way she was old enough to be that deep into her education. She smirked and asked how I old I thought she was. That was an open invite to look into her eyes and smirk back. I guessed 25 and she said she had just turned 25 and was celebrating her birthday with her friends. She said she was amazed. I thought I was cool as shit when I said, it was a gift. Before I could even get her name, my friends dragged me away. Never saw her again.\n\nI would say drinking is a good way to drop some inhibitions, but it's not a good look on everybody and I have a bad habit not knowing my limits. That night I met that girl was a total fluke. Sometimes, meeting that right person is nothing but chance and good luck.",

            "text": "It's honestly a combination of things. Flirting is an enjoyable back and forth of trying to reveal enough but not too much. The easiest way to see if someone is flirting is by how they react to you. If they are really interested in what you have to say, combined with getting closer to you or physically touching you. Then you can try and flirt back to see if that is what they wanted. Don't be too forward but touch their arm and see if they pull away (bad sign) or act like they are flustered and enjoying themselves (good sign). Make a joke and see if they laugh at it. Guys will often sit taller or reposture themselves if you bump them, girls will often lean in to see if you glance downward or flip their hair behind them and expose their neck. None of these rules are set in stone either but if you are getting a bunch of positive signs then you can try to push the envelope (slightly) and gauge the reaction. If they are just being nice or aren't that interested, they'll realize you're starting to flirt and usually give you signs they aren't interested (telling stories about how they were out with their SO the other day or mentioning how they don't like how they never have any friends who can just be their friend and things always get romantic or just becoming more short in responses and changing body language)\n\nThe other half of this is genuinely getting to know someone. If you don't know them it's extremely hard to figure out what is normal and what is flirting. The other thing being that maybe they will change their mind later and not be interested or become interested. We don't always know if we like someone at first or we can realize we aren't that interested and maybe they are thinking something different than you were or are playing hard to get. \n\nThe key is always communication and not getting too invested too early. Let things happen naturally and enjoy the time you're spending together. It's probably worth more that way anyways.\n\nEdited for clarity and not content",

These friends are a couple, and I was single. We're there in the middle of the week, early afternoon, and the place is largely dead. Waitress comes up to get our orders. She's friendly and conversational, likely a bit bored and fishing for a nice tip. Takes my friends orders first. Chats with them briefly. Takes my order, also chats with me. Somehow (honestly can't recall at all how) the conversation gets on the topic of video games. I mention my excitement for RDR2. She also voices her excitement for said game. We briefly voice our experiences playing the first RDR and where we think RDR2 was going. Conversation lasts two, maybe three minutes at most. She ends it to go relay our orders. We don't really conversate further for the rest of our time there beyond normal interactions with food service (you know, thanking for the food and good service, paying, etc.). \n\nAfterwards, and up until this very day, friends are adamant that she was flirting with me. Absolutely refusing to see it any other way. My position is that A. she's a waitress, part of her job is to be friendly and inviting in order to gather tips, B. RDR2 was probably the most hyped game talked about during that time, part of an extremely popular series from a well-known developer. I was bound to find someone else also excited to play it. And C. she's stuck at her job on a slow day, I'm sure she was bored but also probably not looking to put the moves on some random stranger. \n\nWhat do y'all think, flirting or friendly conversation? Now, I know this story is one sided and likely missing context, but to me it seems pretty apparent. I've had my fair share of doubt concerning whether or not someone was flirting with me in the moment, but this is one of the times I am absolutely sure they weren't.",

Mark Mansons ‚ÄòModels‚Äô covers this in more detail, well worth a read if you‚Äôre struggling.\n\nAlso, I had a gimmick: at some point in the conversation I would make a joke about how I‚Äôm a palm reader- would then do this palm reading act (learnt it in primary school, basically BS) the important point is it‚Äôs an excuse to hold their hands- if they‚Äôre into the act and volunteer their hands to be touched by yours (in some cases even asking for their other hand to be read, ‚Äúfor good measure‚Äù) then it‚Äôs a good sign of interest and you‚Äôre well placed to make a move later on in the night. If they pull their hands away/ don‚Äôt go along with it then take the hint and move on. Not so much a flirting tip but a good way to gauge interest in the other person while making yours clear to them.",

But don¬¥t give them too much attention - i mean, don¬¥t pressure them too much - or you¬¥ll be suffocating them and not in that good way. Listen to them, find about their life, interests.. if you spot something they are passionate about (either bad or good) and don¬¥t have too much people to share it with.. they¬¥ll love it when you give them an opportunity to share this kind of stuff. There will be a little voice in their heads saying \"this guy/gal is interesting...\" Try to ask questions when it¬¥s suitable.. sometimes still all you need to do is listen and (even pretend to) care.\n\nDon¬¥t be boring. Don¬¥t answer their questions with \"Uh-uh\", \"yep\", \"dunno\". That¬¥s automatic distancing at its finest.\n\nBe passionate. Be vocabular (I don¬¥t know if this the right word... probably  not) - talk with sentences with words, not caveman¬¥s menu (\"Uh\", \"Oh\", \"k\"). If it is your turn to talk about you, be honest as possible, talk about things that excite you. Everybody loves when some has that passionate spark in their eyes... \n\nUsing WLA\n\n* After you¬¥ve made first contact and have established a similar route or checkpoint, e.g. being in the same social group at the very same moment, engaging them in conversation near the coffee machine in the office or something like that or sharing a path to home, work, school or just walking to anywhere.\n* You can also use WLA from the distance. Not like stalking or something creepy, but you can spend healthy amount of time first learning about them from a little space between you. You could pick up and document in your head traces and amount of their intelligence, their interests and hobbies, what excites or saddens them. You could also very easily feel if they are currently sad or happy. BTW, smiling people can still be sad.. acknowledge that. If you lock your interest on someone that seems sad, be nice to them. Be nice to everybody who doesn¬¥t really deserve otherwise (they¬¥d have to be really scum for that), but if you are nice to them, you¬¥ll make them happier. And you¬¥ll make yourself happier and more confident!\n\nI stopped for a minute and thought about the most important social cue about flirting..\n\nIf you like someone, you could just go to them and say \"Hi!\" and start implementing WLA. Or not. But if they are rude to you or just sigh and walk away.. that is a very strong cue that they are NOT interested or will need some work to be softened. Just, at that moment, think if it¬¥s worth spending time on someone who can¬¥t greet you properly, even if it¬¥s a stranger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that this seems more like general advice than concrete social cues, but i think it¬¥s worth thinking about.",

Let them speak, but make it clear that you are listening and interested in what they're saying, ask them how their day/night is going, who they're with, etc. Make jokes, you want them to want to listen to you. Finally, know your best asset. Are you intelligent? Put that out. Are you physically attractive? Put that out. Do you have any particular accomplishments? Put that out too. As you read the person, play your cards. Don't do all of these at once.\n\nIf you're asking how to tell if someone is flirting with you, then that is tricky.

            "text": "As someone who struggled with flirting and picking up on social cues this is a big one I think I can answer.\n\nI usually take my \"cues\" in layers which cement the deeper \"cues\" I struggle to find/read.\n\nFirst I look for their eye contact.  Are they focused on me or whats going on around me?  If eye contact is \"around me\" its not good.  If you are doing >50% of the speaking try to leverage that back to where they are speaking so they focus on you again since they will be addressing you.  Once the focus is on you, whether its direct eye contact or eyes that wonder ON not around you, thats good!  Once I see lots of eye contact or good strong attention then I know that I can be more confident with looking at more social cues.  \n\nNext I look for physical body language.  Usually I look to see if they try to get closer to myself when seating themselves.  When they move their chair closer or try to sit closer to you for any reason that is a good sign, especially if they stay there.  This could be them saying \"look at this video/picture!\" while they inch in closer to you.  It could be they left for the bathroom, drink, etc. and when they sit back down they try to get a little bit closer. Did they stick around after moving closer? Yes? Good!\n\nDo they \"mimic\" what you do?  Most people will mimic who they are talking to if they are genuinely following the conversation or are into the person they are talking to.  Some people are better at preventing themselves from doing this than others.  You can try to \"test\" this by changing the way you are positioned when speaking.  For example, if you are at dinner and talking try putting both elbows on the table and leaning forward as if being \"pulled\" towards the speaker while they talk which led you to rest yourself on the table with your elbows.  In most cases the other person will mimic a moment after you do this as they continue speaking, or, may lean in once you start speaking..  Just be careful to not use body language that would show you are uncomfortable like folding your arms or leaning back in your seat and slumping.  \n\n\nThe bigger ones I struggled with were the more \"intimate\" cues which are easier to spot when you catch the other cues.  \n\nMy least favorite is \"double speak\" or \"innuendo.\"  Usually saying something but inferring something else.  Depending on how well you know the person they could be speaking two-dimensionally or be \"double-speaking.\"  Two examples.\n\nExample 1:\nYou both are watching a movie, a PG-13 Rom-Com to be precise.  We just saw John win Janes heart because he didn't stop trying to make the date perfect no matter how many things went wrong (for comedies sake!)  Your date may say something following this scene like, \"I love it when someone cares so much that they want everything to be perfect.\"  Are they talking about the movie or your date?... but seriously, why not both my dude?  \n\nExample 2:\nYou both are watching a Rate R film now, a Rom-Com as well.  John and Jane were just very \"hot n heavy\" during a particular scene after arriving home from their own first date.  Your own date may say, \"I could NEVER have sex on the first date.\" Now with this one theres inflection in their words that you may need to look for, as well as body language.  Did they try to hint that you ain't getting laid tonight, or were they inferring you may be a lucky exception?  This type of speak should be \"filed\" away for clarification if you aren't sure.  Additionally, you will want to keep an eye out for more cues.\n\nMy last thing is some genuine advice regardless of the cues (unless these cues say \"STAY AWAY!\")  is this.  If you have that voice inside that says, \"Is she into me?\" Or \"Should I ask her over?\" Try it.  That may be your gut picking up on cues but you aren't realizing it because you are so focused on playing everything right.  The worst that can happen is being rejected which will make things MUCH easier when finding where you stand.  Best case you find you stand right where you want with that person and things will progress much faster with them because once that first hard question is asked the others start to flow.",

But I think the most important thing to remember is - NOT ALL PEOPLE FLIRT CONSCIOUSLY.\n\nI am a very flirty person, but I'm not flirting consciously 99% of the time.\n\nI am a very touchy person, and I touch people a lot, but I'm not flirting with them at all. \n\nNext is my eye contact.  A few years ago I learned a valuable lesson not to look anywhere else when talking and well, now I only look a person in the eyes. It could look very intimidating and kind of flirty. My look isn't a deadly one, but a really friendly and welcoming, as my GF says, but again. I'M. NOT. FLIRTING.\n\nThird is smiling. And it's almost impossible to see me without it when talking.\n\nAt the same time, I'm really talkative and interested in people. I let them speak about themselves, teach me stuff they're good at, show off their skills. And I show a genuine interest in it because I think you can learn so many things just by listening and be liked by a lot of people. This is a piece of valuable advice to be liked by the public.\n\nSo again, not everyone is flirting even if it seems like it, be really careful with it when someone acts like this, and test it out. But all of these I wrote about work because people actually think you're flirting with them. Experiment with everything a little bit, look how others react.

Baiting is rather childish actually but it helps you to form a connection first with the other person. Do not lie to your interest.

The best way you can flirt with someone is just *talk to them!* Best pickup line in the world is - Hi, I'm Goryokaku... and let the conversation continue from there.\n\nTips for good conversation perhaps, which, when done well can turn into the magical flirting are-\n\n* Listen! for god's sake don't just talk *at* someone about what you like or dislike. Listen, try to figure out what they like, and look for ways to identify with them, common ground that you can both relate to. There are very few people that don't have something in common, however superficial it may seem.\n* Don't put someone into a box if they express a view you may disagree with. People love to assume that politics and beliefs are black and white, \"oh you like X so you must be one of them \\[insert assumed group here\\]'. No. That's total horseshit. People are nuanced, and have multiple beliefs and reasons for thinking the way they do.\n* No expectations. Just because you're flirting with someone it *does not* mean that you'll get anything out of it. Hell, the vast majority of women I've flirted with (I'm male cis/het) I had every confidence it wasn't going anywhere! For multiple reasons, such as me being in a relationship, or them being in a relationship, or someone you didn't look at in that way etc. I was just enjoying talking to interesting people.\n* Finally just enjoy talking to people. Flirting is not a means to an end (read: getting laid). If you meet someone you connect with that may happen. Otherwise it is just talking to people and having a good time. The best thing about parties is getting to chat shite to randoms. It's great fun.\n\nTL:DR Listen to and talk to people, don't put pressure on anyone (including yourself) and just enjoy other people's company. Good conversation is one of life's greatest gifts.",

Swung by her house so she could change, swung by my house so I could also and grab a couple of lawn chairs that would fold out flat, and some sodas.  Set up by the lake and she takes off her outer garments to reveal her smoking bod (at least a DD) in a bikini, which reinforced she was way out of my league.  I layer back and shut my eyes to just enjoy the sun and the sound of the waves.  About 10 minutes later she's on top of me saying she's been wanting to do this for months and we start making out.  Ended up back at my place spending the rest of the day bumping uglies.  She ended up confessing later she wanted to focus on school but didn't want to date, but I guess I had missed all her previous cues (which I still have no idea what they were), so she finally just decided to be \"blunt\".

People want obvious social cues so they don't have to guess about whether or not people are attracted to them, because they're afraid of being hurt if they don't. Unfortunately most people feel this to some degree, so few people will make it as obvious as our more socially anxious friends would like. \n\nIf you're interested in someone, just show an interest in them. Someone once told me that people love to talk about what they know about-- find out what someone is interested in and show a genuine curiosity about it, you'll barely have to do any talking and people will think you're a great conversationalist. Most importantly get it out of your head that there are rules to any of this. There are no rules. Sometimes someone who seems perfect for you just won't see it. The hardest thing for me in dating was realizing it's not a big deal, and that the opposite sex weren't gatekeepers to my personal validation, they're just people who have the same social needs as everyone else. I've noticed from my conversation with women that a lot of men make the mistake of being way to forward sexually in their flirtation. You should be funny before you're anything else.",

I had a friend, let‚Äôs call her Sarah, bring a friend of hers, say Casey, in from out of town.  Casey was wearing a crop top and cutoff jean shorts when she met a group of us at the bar, and was staying with Sarah.\n\nSarah: Zabuzaxsta, this is Casey.  Casey, zabuzaxsta.\n\nMe: Oh I‚Äôm sorry, that‚Äôs ridiculous.\n\nCasey: Hunh?\n\nMe: Well obviously all your clothes shrank in Sarah‚Äôs drier!  Sarah, how could you let that happen?\n\nCasey: *giggling*\n\nSarah: Har har\n\nAfter that, Casey was stuck to me like *glue.*  Ugh I still can‚Äôt believe that worked.  Point is, if she had rolled her eyes at me like Sarah, I‚Äôd have assumed she likely wasn‚Äôt interested and just been generically friendly.  Instead, she negged me back a couple of times and, well, I knew we were flirting.",

I wasn‚Äôt too into the girl I was dating, but wasn‚Äôt confident enough to break up with her and try to date this other girl.\n\nPhysically, she was gorgeous. Turns out she was a dancer/gymnast.

No lie‚Ä¶ the lab required our partner to lay down on their back and then with a straight leg, bring it up toward your head as close as you can get without hands. Measures hamstring flexibility. Then we mark off where our partner was and we use a protractor to get the angles. She had at least 150 degrees. It was insane. I kick myself for not picking up on the clues.\n\nAnyways. Here are some typical signs. Taken from my experience and what my wife of 13 years still does to me. :)\n\n- Preening in front of you\n- Making physical contact\n- Finding ways to spend time with you\n- Laughing at your jokes. Even bad ones.\n- Complimenting you\n- While sitting, pointing knees toward you (we subconsciously face our feet/legs toward what we want to engage in)\n- Playing with hair\n- Brushing hair to one side to expose the neck\n- Biting/licking lips\n\nMost of these things are subconscious responses.

If I'm with friends (in some situations even alone, like a cafeteria I once frequented, it happened multiple times) and a woman is glancing at me and noticing I'm looking at her from time to time, I've signaled interest. When she begins to continue to smile and make sure I'm watching and laugh and continues to make sure I'm watching her and seeing her in a good light, I knot that this is signaling interest. It is BY NO MEANS a certain thing, but it is definitely encouraging.\n\nNext comes what to do in order to approach someone who is a complete stranger. You do NOT want to be aggressive in these situations. You should ensure that you're presenting yourself in a manner that is entirely nonthreatening and just be honest. I've found that when I'm with friends, it's a much simpler matter because they don't see you as some weird loner. Further, your own body posture should present confidence, but not overconfidence. For instance, coming forward directly & quickly can appear super creepy if it's over a long distance. They might even get nervous and leave. But if you head in that direction with a purpose - say, to order a drink at the bar - and end up close to them, you can look at them from where you are and start a conversation. And it should be a question to them that is considerate, honestly something you're interested in about them and you should be ready to follow up with another question. If they're with friends, it's also much safer and they should feel more confident.\n\nThis all said, I made the mistake of not considering what smart-asses my friends were when I was demonstrating that they were stupid not to have the balls to approach someone who is giving signals that there might be some interest. While the odds are still pretty much 50/50, it's worth the risk to strike up some kind of conversation. I approached the group of girls who appeared to be having a good time across from our table, went up close to the one with whom I'd been making eye contact and said - \"I couldn't help but come over and say 'hi\" since it's evident that you and your friends are out for the night and I might not ever see you again. What brings you to XXXX campus?\" She was very sweet and said that they were there for a seminar and that they were from several states over, but while we were talking, my buddy had come up & sat on the barstool behind me and began mimicking my physical behavior. She thought it was funny and said she thought I was cute, but didn't want to give her number or take mine, because she and her group were leaving the next day. I have no idea whether this was the case or not, but it was a fun attempt, anyway. \n\nThe moral of the story being that, if you try and fail, it's not the end of the world.",

Get rid of that stern look on your face and if you feel/catch someone looking at you just look them in the eyes and give a friendly smile. This is only a small step.

Everyone is kind of unique in how they approach life and not everyone is going to use the same tells.\n\nSo, my advice is to be friendly to everyone. But let's narrow it down and you wanna know if someone is flirting with you or if they are just friendly. \n\n1.) Pay attention to their eyes. Where are their eyes looking?\n\n2.) Pay attention to their body. Are they jittery, can't stay still, or do they stand still? What are their hands doing, what about their feet? Definitely look at their shoulders too.\n\n3.) Without being creepy, watch them as they go on about their business. Do they exhibit any behavioral traits to you alone? What are they? When they talk to people besides you, does anything change from when they talk to you?\n\n4.) Once you know how they act around you, and how they act around other people you can begin to draw conclusions. \n\nIf they look at you, when they talk to you and only look into your eyes, they are intrigued by you, they listen to everything you say with intent. Could be friendly, or could be attraction. \n\nBody language! Body language Body language Body language! If the person is shifty, they are uncomfortable, or have adhd or something. But most importantly, hands and shoulders. If they are fiddling with something, be it hair, wallet, phone, or keys or something else, then they are not at ease, either they could be flirty and just can't hide it or you make them uncomfortable. \n\nIf they have stiff shoulders, you need to back off. They should be relaxed. Never force yourself to talk to someone if they aren't comfortable. Doubly so if your a male talking to a female and in a dance club or something. \n\nSomeone who is into you and flirty will likely be inclined to look at you with intent, and maybe inclined to touch you, or if they don't feel comfortable with that, may fiddle with something, like their hair or phone. People who are into you will talk to you a certain way, that others will not get.\n\nYou have to be able to compare how they talk to you and interact with you to other people to be able to begin to draw conclusions.\n\nOr you can raise the ante, and be flirtatious back. If they touch your arm, touch their shoulder. Closer to their central body than they touched you, preferably. If they compliment you, compliment them back. Keep at it until they stop or one of you breaks the veil and tells the other they like each other.\n\nThe idea is that it's a subliminal game. Not everyone is the same so that means the 'tells' that person A uses to indicate they like you do not mean that person B does.",

I don't think, \"Oh I need to wink now and bite my lip.\" A lot of times it's automatic, it kind of just happens and friends usually point it out to me later that I was flirting, when I really wasn't trying to.\n\nHaving said that, it's usually the same for women. When I start talking to a woman and she's super funny and friendly, I don't immediately think, \"Oh gosh! She likes me!\". Friendliness is not flirtiness. It's the subconscious cues, such as:\n\n1. They touch you thoughtlessly. What I mean by that is that they may reach out and rub your arm or stroke your hair unprompted or without saying anything about it. If they ask outright, \"Oh that fabric looks interesting, can I feel it?\", it's probably not flirting, at least not of the thoughtless automatic variety.\n2. They look away when you lock eyes. So this is a weird one because when I was younger I thought this was a bad thing, but later on when I would ask it was almost always a sign they liked me but were a bit shy about it. It's when you're across the room and you notice each other and you lock eyes for a moment and either you or the other person look away, almost like you're embarrassed you got caught looking. It's not a guarantee, but worth approaching that person and striking up a conversation to test it and see if any other signs pop up. If not, you can dismiss.\n3. They fidget with their body. This one is tricky because I've been on dates with women who were nervous and fidgety, but weren't that attracted to me otherwise. They'd play with a fork, or their carry-on. That's just nervous energy. If they brush their hair a lot, or play with their necklace, that's a better sign. Bracelet is a tougher tell, because it's on their body but also easy to just fiddle with when nervous.\n4. Body posture. This is more general but much more telling than a lot of the others. Are they sitting up straight? Probably just friendly. Do they have a more relaxed posture and leaning toward you? They like you. People will generally face you when you're talking to them, but where their body is facing is much more telling. If it's on a couch with a few people on it, did they make a point to move their body to face you or are they just sitting out on the couch normally?
