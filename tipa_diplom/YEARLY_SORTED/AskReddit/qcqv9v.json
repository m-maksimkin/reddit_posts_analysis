She didn’t make me wear a condom, which 17-year-old me thought was awesome, but didn’t realize this was *Red Flag #1.*\n She was on birth control, but I still always pulled out. \n\nAfter a couple weeks, my best friend I went to high school with (who was also at the same school) had a chat with me, and had me see things in a different perspective. Long story short, from then on I decided to just always wear a condom with her. \n\nI explained this to her, and she said “that was probably best, since her birth control can sometimes not work”\n\n*This was Red Flag #2*\n\nWe weren’t a couple, nor did we have any conversation as such, but she took a picture of me and her while I was sleeping, and posted it on Instagram. \n\n*This was Red Flag #3*\n\nI decided that it was best to exit our relationship. She did not take it well, but I said we could try and stay friends, primarily to make things less awkward since I sat next to her in a class. \n\nAt the start of the next week, she mentioned that:\n\n“I was in the parking garage earlier today and I couldn’t find your car“\n“What?” I replied\n“ I was in the parking garage earlier today and I didn’t see your car“ (I was in a hurry and I randomly moved it)\n“ You said you couldn’t find it… also you don’t have a car on campus, so why were you in the parking garage?“\n\n“I was going to my roommates car, to get her something.” \n(Complete lie)\n\n“I sold it.”\n\n“What kind do you drive now?”\n\n“Not that one.”\n\n*RED FLAG 4,5,&6” all lumped together*\n\nSo, decided not to continue that friendship. \n\nI did get horny one March day, and tried to hook up with her again, but she said she was actively hooking up with someone else, a guy on our floor, no big deal.\n\nLittle did I know this would be a bullet dodged.  \n\nRemainder of the school year goes by, and I notice her on campus Sophomore year… gained a little bit of weight. \n\nMy friend calls me later the day and asked me “when was the last time I had slept with her?” \n\n“October of last year, why?”\n\n“She’s pregnant, and due in December; 9 months after the last time I tried hooking \n\nNuclear meltdown avoided.",

Honestly she was my first girlfriend (first everything really) and we had fun together for a little over 2 years. I liked her but love wasn't in the air. I suspect her proposal was more from friends convincing her that I can provide for her as a soldier. I even bought her a nice necklace while I was away (before the proposal). When I went back for R&R, I broke up with her, gave her the necklace (because I didn't know what to do with it) and never looked back. We had a long talk about what we both wanted and how I knew she wouldn't be happy with me (and vice versa which I kept to myself). She wanted that machismo hood type dude and I was the geeky soldier who didn't get in trouble.

So late on a monday at around 8pm, I took the coach back home and took a seat in the back corner so I would not draw attention to myself. Two people came on the coach and sat on the opposite side of me, a woman and an irish man. The coach driver said that this is the coach for (my town) station, so if you are on the the wrong coach, get out now, and the lady drunkenly said thank you for that.\n\nWhen the coach started moving, the man was playing EDM as loud as possible on his phone and most people close to the back moved forwards. I did not because I had a guitar on me and moving would be impractical and since the two were not sober they might have a negative reaction to me moving since I had to have slid next to them to move. He played his music for about 30 minutes, I just turned up my music on my headphones and messaged my classmates about the situation because they always tell me to message if I am safe on the late night commutes.\n\nThe man was getting more and more erratic, he couldn't sit still and kept moving seats. He was not just drunk, he had likely taken ice (the australian street name for crystal meth). So I am sitting next to someone who is on one of the worst drugs you could be on.\n\nAbout an hour after we got on the coach, the man decides to lie down, so his head is touching my leg, I politely asked him to move and he asked if I paid for that seat and I was scared and frosen because it reminded me of a time when someone did the exact same thing when I was a kid and yelled at me when I said no and the memories came flooding back. He yelled at me and I did not say a word back. I was blank and scared. Luckily he got out of my face and kept looking at me. I drowned myself into my music.\n\nHe got out of his seat and walked to the driver and they talked, I did not hear what they said, and the irish man walked back to his seat. 10 minutes go pass and he walked up again and the driver let's him off the coach early. \n\nA bit of time goes pass and the lady accompanying him talked to me and apologised, she seamed to have sobered up and realised what happened, we talked about the man, she was trying to shake the man off because he was following her, even to the point of going on the same coach as her.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity of a coach ride and trying to hold back tears we got to the station. The coach driver said that anyone involved should talk to him and some ptv (public transport victoria) workers. So I stayed behind and the driver had to apologies to try and keep his job because he broke company policy to let the man of the coach because the man asked to get off early or else he would bash up one of the passengers and the driver. The other employees said that he did the right thing and that he did not have to apologies, I then explained what happened. I left and got into the car that my sister was picking me up in. When I got home I started screaming and crying myself to sleep and told my family.\n\nOnly because I realised that the passenger that he would have bashed would have been me because I made him angry for asking him to move his head away from my leg.\n\nSo had the bus driver not let him off or had I'd dress in my female clothes, I could have died or seriously injured because ice addicts can't feel pain so fighting back would do nothing, plus I am not that strong and I am not that tactical under pressure.\n\n\n\nLastly I have not been on a bus since and I have been on a coach once since and had a breakdown on the coach. I also did not turn up to uni the following day because I still needed to process it.",

I just limit to a small spot, so my parents can see me. This was around the 4th of July holiday. Suddenly, I saw something in my way, causing me to run. I ran into a random wall, causing me to suffer a nose bled. I wasn't sure what happened, but I was crying like any child would be. I was taken in to get checked out. The strange light made a whizzing sound, which was why I ran. It turned out a group of teenagers was having their firework game. BTW, even back then, there was a law in Massachusetts restricting firework, which was why many had paid extra to anyone to get some from out of state. The thing was, this was in the projects, or da hood. (Tales from the Hood, came out two months prior.)  So, you would think fireworks would be the last thing kids were to got their hands on. Still, many didn't see a problem, just as long they were careful on aiming them. \n\nYep, my quick run into a brick wall was to dodge a rouge bottle rocket. My parents and other folks couldn't do much of anything because they weren't able to tell who did what. It only stopped when a police car was just passing by. \n\n(Yea, many didn't trust the police to the point some would just dial 2-1-1 or the non-emergency line to the fire department, which ironically were the ones who did public service announcements on fireworks.)",

Come to find out right then that husband is cheating and had cheated before, the proven spanning back to when my child was a baby (and husband was in the same house where I and baby were sleeping). Without a job I couldn't move out for a long time. I was finally able to about 1 year after I found out he was cheating.\nAnother couple of months go by and I had filed for divorce. Then ex sets things up really strangely for a weekend and I figure out that he was going out of town to meet the girlfriend (who was why we broke up).\nSo then the next weekend I'm out on a date and out dancing at like midnight and I get a booty call text from the ex. Mind you, I know that he was hooking up with girlfriend 1 week prior. He says he wants to get back together. I just wanted my Mom at that moment. (Not mother-of-the-year by any stretch, but the one person who was there for me through leaving my ex). So my Mom says \"what would you want to go back?\" And what I wanted was for him to stop drinking.\nSo we talk seriously later the next week, and I say that to him. His response is to get really angry and say that I wouldn't be giving up anything. Needless to say we didn't try to get back together. The divorce went through about 2 months later.\nI really do think that I was in danger of him killing me in a murder-suicide in the months following the divorce. For way too long I put up with (and responded to) his drunken texts and phone calls full of blame, shame, and sexual pressure. Finally I started to realize \"I don't have to answer this now,\" and then when the next day came \"I don't have to answer this at all.\"\nI put into place some actions to shield our child from his blame, grief, and anger. I stopped being driven by fear that I wasn't attractive or sexy enough. I started to feel free. I started to go hiking, take pictures of nature, read every book I owned, and watch what I wanted to on TV.\nEventually I met a wonderful, compassionate man (who taught me a lot of compassion for my ex) and after a while he met my child who eventually gave us the go-ahead for marriage. So we spent the better part of the last decade finishing raising that child.\nI am thankful whenever my ex interacts with me/impacts me that I didn't go back. I don't think I would be alive either because of illness or domestic violence.\nSince the divorce my health has gotten so much better, and for almost 2 years now I have been basically pain-free. Fatigue and depression are distant memories connected to that previous marriage. The dark days are over.",

I finally found one of her social media accounts and I decided to follow and message it. I said I would ask her out in person but couldn’t find her any where. Well she responded back and followed me back and eventually asked me out on one of my posts. We started talking and I started just confessing how I felt and how long I’ve been looking for her. I thought she was the one because we had such a good chemistry! We FaceTimed for the first time and we’re talking for hours and then we both called it a night. Wake up the next morning and asked if she wanted to hangout and come with me to run some Aron’s! Ya know get some one on one time and just get to know her in person! I didn’t want anything sexual or really anything physical at the time, I just wanted to get to know her and get a genuine conversation…. Well I couldn’t explain how uncomfortable I was during that whole time. She was being very touchy and was just over all being very flirty. I kept reminding her that I just wanted to get to know her. She was really into spiritual shit and tbh I was not about it. How she talks to ghosts and welcomes them in her life. I already found that very strange but I thought maybe she was kidding. She didn’t even bluff. We went to some store and it had some dolls and she said she had a doll that she plays with and talks with. I instantly knew, I was not about it. I just wanted to go home and puke on how fucking terrified I was. She kept talking to each of the dolls and I was just hurrying to go out the door. She continues getting really flirty and touchy and I’m just wanting to go home. I dropped her off, rushed home and she calls me as soon as I get home. I just said I’m not ready for dating or relationships right now, and then blocked her. She still likes my posts periodically but still scares tf out of me.",

So like a month ago this guy who I've been \"fuck buddies\" with for a while attempted suicide and I didn't know until he told me he moved back with his parents and we wouldn't be able to see eachother as often anymore. I happened to have a tinder date who booked us a hotel in the same city where my buddy's parents lived and since I had the room to myself for a while I asked him if he wanted to come over and he said yes. A couple hours before he came I met up with this other guy I've been playing video games with because he also lived in the same city, the whole time i was with him he was pretty much trying to fuck and I'm a slut so every time I'm in this type of situation i always always end up spreading my legs, but this time i didn't. The guy drops me off and like 30mins after my buddy arrives. We had sex that night and did a couple more things then he left. Three or four weeks after that happens I met up with the video games dude again and ended up hooking up with him this time, like a day or two after that happens the tinder guy books us a hotel again in that same city, I let my buddy know so we can meet up while I'm up there. He ended up not being able to go see me that night so we didn't do anything. Fast forward a couple days after I'm back home the video games guy hits me up and tells me he tested positive for Chlamydia, so my friend in TWO occasions could've caught it, but got extremely lucky and didn't. I don't think getting Chlamydia is a huge tactical nuke to dodge, but the way he dodged it was tactical for sure.",

Though the article in Der Spiegel came out on the 17th, the daily mail and business insider printed a tabloid piece that mistranslated the German piece. \n\nI'm 2015 I was given the Whistleblower Award by the German Federation of Scientists and Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms. The same award that was given to Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning. I, however, didn't release anything new, I simply connected the dots that the government already had out there. I testified in German parliament of the role of Ramstein AFB in the illegal drone war and surveillance of world citizens. I also spoke at the United Nations, as well as I was one of two Americans who showed up to a council to determine international law of robotic and autonomous warfare. \n\nDuring this time, one of the officers who came into the drone program after I left and whose wife is a lawyer for Raytheon and Johnson & Johnson started stalking me and making YouTube videos, claiming that I am a paedophile death cult leader who used the souls of the people I killed to give me supernatural powers. This dude, is literally insane. \n\nFast forward to Autumn 2019. I start going to my local city council meetings because the mayor and council got caught red handed using a thing called tax increment financing for pet projects as well as using their power to ruin the lives of anyone who came to speak against the actions of the elected officials. \n\nA few veteran friends and local once middle class did our research and went to battle. Being my background as it was, I tried to get through to them. But one day I was telling a story and none of them were paying attention, so I used my staff sergeant voice. Meeting was adjourned and a few weeks later I decided that what we were doing was wasting time and we needed to go up the chain of command. \n\nLate January 2020 there is a warrant out for my arrest. February 11th, I turn myself in to the police and spend the next 30 days in jail, part of it in isolation.  The charges were \"threats and intimidation of a public official.\" They put my bail at $100k, twice the legal limit under the Montana state constitution. Mind you, this last Monday a man was caught having raped and assaulted a woman nearly to death, and was given a $50k bail. \n\nI got out the day the lockdown happened. My mother gave up her retirement. But you wanna know where all my support was? They fled to the hills. All those people that I spoke to, shared my story with... silent. I had to fight this by myself with no money. Public defence. \n\nWhen I was released I was not on parole or had any tracking device. I had cops follow me everywhere. Once I had an animal control lady chase me claiming that my dog attacked a deer and that she had proof. She called the cops on me and I almost got into a fight 3v1 over her Karen bullshit. \n\nEvery 2 months the prosecution came to me with a deal for a lesser offense. I told him he could go fuck himself. \n\nOh, the evidence that the State brought against me? The blog and the YouTube channel of the fat fucking tool who had nothing better to do than stalk and harass me. He made a video, splicing together things I've said and sent it to the city council under the title \"Brandon Bryant threatens to kill city council.\"\n\nA 4 minute clip of a 16 minute video of me talking about a Taoist spiritual ritual I was going to do to cleanse my spirit of hate. Lol. This guy also had a degree in \"religion\" from Florida. He claims that I'm god. It gets better. \n\nSo in my time whistleblowing, I have gotten a ton of threats from people. The left call me a monster and the right call me a traitor. I have videos of my responses to those threats where I say that I will defend myself and kill my attackers. I went to the police and others for protection and the police laughed at me and everyone else said I was on my own. If any of these yallqueda fucks hurt my family....\n\nThe FBI threatened my mother saying that if I didn't shut up then \"ISIS\" would kill her. I can't tell you how traumatizing that was.\n\nWell, my stalker made a video he released in the middle of my trial and the persecution took it and tried to use it as evidence. It was embarrassing for them. Obviously spliced.\n\nMy stalker bet his whole reputation on my going to jail. We finished a day early, the jury spent less than 30 minutes deliberating. I almost was going to spend 10 years in jail and $150k in debt.  Instead I won and made it so that my stalker will never be able to pass the bar exam to become a lawyer because of ethical concerns. He manipulated government officials to come after me because they were desperat e to hurt me and cover up their crimes. \n\nRight now I have a case I'm bringing up against the entire USA government and I'm gonna fuck them up as hard as I can. \n\nI totally pulled a reversal card.\n\nEdit: I have to add this too. About a year ago I was taking my girlfriend to a hot springs and on our way back I totally had a car interdiction happen. Guy tried to run me off the road at 70+mph, threw a knife that hit me in the head through our open windows. When the cop showed up they took my driver's license and the knife. The guy was charged with felony assault and released on less than 10k. He was a former marine. The state decided to charge me and try to put me in jail again for 6 months with \"driving with a suspended license.\" It was only suspended because of political bullshit trying to take away my ability to travel.",

They get out of the car and immediately start demanding large sums of money.  The tap was so light that there wasn't even a mark on my front bumper.\n\nAfter blocking traffic for several minutes, a cop comes and tells us to pull into a parking lot at the next light.  We drive up to the intersection.  The gangbangermobile pulls into the parking lot.\n\nI take a hard left and floor it.\n\nIt was about 0.6 seconds later that I realized, \"What the **FUCK** am I doing?\" and I immediately pull over.  Being a 1 way street, I stop on the left side.  The street was part of a bridge underpass, so the curb was ~18\" tall at that point with a guardrail above that, a detail that will become very important momentarily.\n\nCop comes up and asks me why I did what I did.  I told him that I was scared shitless by the gangbangers and panicked in fear.  He takes my license and registration and walks back to the other car.\n\nThe curb is very important here because I am literally unable to open my car door where I sat, and traffic was still moving all around us.  Had I been able to get out, I surely would have been made to do (and absolutely fail) a DUI test.  Once failed, they would have searched my car and found the half full beer bottle jammed under my seat (that I took from the bar) right next to my (otherwise 100% legal) loaded 9mm handgun.  Furthermore, they would have searched my passenger who I later found out had an 8 ball in his pocket.\n\nLet's tally things up here, shall we?\n\n- DUI\n\n- Leaving the scene of an accident\n\n- Evading a police officer\n\n- Possession of open container\n\n- Possession of a firearm while intoxicated\n\n- Possession of narcotics\n\nSo here I am, this 20-something white kid at 2:30am after a Saturday night out downtown in the big city, wondering just how royally fucked I was.\n\nSeveral minutes go by.  I see multiple additional cruisers pulling up into the parking lot.  Feeling of dread triples.\n\nSeveral more minutes go by.  Officer is approaching my vehicle again, from the driver's side.  I roll down my window.  He hands me back my license and registration along with the other driver's info and tells me to get home safe and have a good night.\n\nScared sober, I drop the acquaintance off, drive home and change my underwear.\n\nI found out through a friend that the gangbangers had several open warrants and they found some other... unmentionables is how he put it, during the subsequent search.\n\nNot only have I not driven drunk since then, that was the last at-fault accident I ever had in my life.",

No big potholes or puddles or crazy rocks on the way in I followed my friend right behind him no problem and had an amazing weekend.\n On the way back home I'm driving by myself in the morning and it was so dry and dusty on the loose gravel road it was actually alot more difficult on the way down I was finding. My car was like slipping on the loose gravel here and there but I was able to get it under control, and about an hour into the drive out-  suddenly through the dust ahead on the winding road down , I saw a bear. A fuxkin grizzly bear ....and then ....3 babies..Holy shit I go to break so I can turn around and go back up the mountain but forgot to not break hard and fast on the loose gravel and my car starts spinning around entirely loosing control , and I'm slamming on the breaks (now I know I shouldn't have done that)  and I hear my car bang bang bang in the front under the hood from some rocks that stopped me from spinning....so I'm in my car that's basically positioned across a road for any incoming outgoing car on the winding road to just smack right into , but that's when I heard this creaking sound and felt kinds like butterflies in my stomach when I realize I'm on a mountain and the road is a cliff.\nI was tight to the inner part going down but after spinning around like that the front part of my car is basically teetering off the edge of the cliff and the some rocks /boulders had kind of caught the undercarriage of my car....the dust was settling and I could see how friggin high up I was just looking carefully side to side and I thought I have to open the door quick and jump out because it's gonna fall.....so I open my door so carefully and at the hinge of the door open at the bottom, like first place I was looking to see if I could just see air or what, I open it and look and there nothing there just sheer cliff. Fear like I never had and I don't know what  kicked in but throw my car in reverse as hard as I can and I back up somehow onto the road but ripping off the bottom of my car in the front which then I think fell off the cliff because I didn't see it after. Fuckin hurt my neck tho some kinda whip lash from the initial spinning, but just thinking about how close I was to like silently Thelma and Louise ing right off that cliff, alone , with no reception, on a road that took 2 hours to drive in ....no one would have had any idea where I was.....except the grizzlies.\n\nPs thanks to anyone that read my story I know it may not seem to crazy to some people but I truly felt  really really lucked out and dodged that potentially gruesome fate.",

            "text": "If you are a male over 40 you should pay particular attention to my nuclear bomb averted story...\n\nI've been active my whole life, from practicing and competing in martial arts in my 20's and 30's, to running ultramarathons in my 40's, to freediving in my 50's. I've never had a health issue and with the exception of slightly high cholesterol, have never been sick apart from the occasional cold. I dont smoke, drink, or do drugs. All my annual physicals are excellent. I still outrun and out exercise my 20 year old son.\n\nEarly last year I went to see a naturopath to learn if I could improve even more my healthy lifestyle, including natural ways of lowering my \"high-end-of-normal\" cholesterol. She proposed becoming vegan, and to take a benchmark blood test of my current heart health via a novel predictive diagnostic blood test developed in California called a PULS test (Pulmonary Unstable Legion Syndrome) designed to identify a person at risk of heart disease. I knew nothing about the accuracy of the test but did it anyway. When the results came back we were both a bit surprised. The PULS test predicted that my 56 year old ultramarathoning/freediving/karate pumping heart was equivalent to that of a 79 year old heart and that I was at an elevated risk of a heart attack. It didnt make sense. So the advice from the naturopath was to ignore it for now, continue on a vegan diet, and do it again in a year.\n\nAfter a year of healthy vegan living I re-did the PULS test, expecting the results to be much improved. This time my heart was worse: 85+ years old.\n\nCurious but not too concerned, I did my annual physical during the Spring of 2021 and was told by my GP that I was in great shape and would live forever. But then I showed her my PULS test results and asked if I should be concerned. My GP told me she had never heard of the test and it was probably  a bullshit upsell from my naturopath. But given my scientific background, this little piece of outlier data bothered me, so I asked to be referred to a specialist. The GP refused. And refused again. But I persisted and she finally agreed.\n\nA few week later I went to see a specialist who put me on a treadmill for a stress test. Passed with flying colors. He old me I was healthy as a horse and would live to be hundred years old. But when I showed my PULS test he claimed he never to have heard of it. I asked him to investigate. 2 week later he called me and said he investigated by speaking to all his colleagues: no one had heard if it. Told me it had no value and to ignore it.\n\nBut by this time I had called the lab in California which sent me some case studies and so based on my own assessment I asked the specialist to do a CT angiogram on me so we could actually SEE if there was a problem rather than relying on simple blood chemical indicators. He refused. And refused. But I was a pain in the ass and  eventually he  agreed. But he triaged me as low priority. My CT scan was scheduled 10 months from then: Feb 2022.\n\nI judged the delay to be unwise. So a week later I spent $2500 to a private clinic (I'm Canadian and normally have free medical services) to do a CT angiogram where they injected dye into my bloodstream to see if I have any cardiac issues.\n\nThe results of the scan were sobering. I was informed that I have severe artherialsclerois and 2 blockages in my heart, both blocked 80%. One of these blockages is in a spot affectionately known as \"the widowmaker.\" Thus, I learned that day that I have serious heart disease requiring a serious intervention. This diagnosis  was completely missed by 4 separate physicians. The only one that got it right was the inventor of the PULS test  - Dr. Harrington - who created the test for exactly this reason: to figure out why 25% of people with heart disease go undetected via traditional medical tests. And die. \n\nHis research likely saved my life.\n\nSoon afterward I was on a surgeons table having 2 stents inserted. I'm now fine. In fact, Its been 2 months since  I had the sterns put in and I'm even more physically capable than ever. Interestingly, the reason I never had any symptoms - according to the surgeon - is because extreme sports helped grow additional capillaries that have by-passed the blockage.\n\nAnyway, the upshot of all this is the following. First - and this is just my non medical opinion earned from my own experience -  if you have a family history of coronary disease or your cholesterol is elevated then go get a PULS test. Best decision I ever made.\n\nSecond, be your own advocate when dealing with our medical system: if I had not insisted/cajoled my doctors or followed up on my own the conflicting data then my condition would likely have gone undetected with pretty dire repercussions. Be aware that I'm not blaming the doctors: they have constraints and protocols that they follow and this is perfectly rationale.  I doubt anyone would have been able to tell that I was a likely candidate for heart disease. However, just because they didnt make a mistake following these protocols didnt mean they were right! They were dead wrong. And so it is incumbent on us to understand their constraints and to do our own risk assessment for next steps outside of these constraints, as warranted.\n\nNuclear disaster averted.",

But, when i got there, she was going through some really tough times, and I was literally halfway across the country, alone, while she locked herself in her room to cry or something.\n\nTurns out, she 'cheated' on me (we weren't actually together, so it wasn't cheating), and she got pregnant.  she felt super guilty, but what made it even worse for her, was as I showed up, she was having a miscarriage from the pregnancy, and she didn't want to tell me about it.\n\nWell, that was the last time I saw/talked to her.  I had no idea this is what was going on with her until she touched base with me like 10 years later.  but why was this a tactical nuke i dodged? Because she ended up getting married to someone else, and had 4 kids with him. 2 of them are severely autistic, and another (her 4th) died after about 4 months from SIDS.  she got so upset by it (and she always had issues with mental health), that she killed herself.  She left her husband with 2 severely autistic children, 1 'normal child' 1 dead child, and 1 dead wife.  I feel so bad for the guy, but I honestly never said a single word to him in my entire life.  Plus, I'm sure as hell not able to actually offer any help to him.  But obviously I always wonder 'what if...' what if I stuck it out?  Would our kids have been born healthy?

He hit it off with a chick who was at the bar with a friend of hers and it turned into a bit of a double date. All three of them were pretty drunk before we decided as a group to head back to our place. \n\nThere was more drinking when we got home but Kevin and his date soon ended up back in his room, leaving Allison and I alone in the living room, where we soon started making out. We decided to head back to my room after I had gotten her top off in the living room, but she had overdone it with the drinking & started to feel sick as she was taking her pants off. She said she needed a minute. So we sat there on  the edge of my bed for a few with her head in her hands trying to decide if she was going to puke before she decided she needed to lay down. She passed out pretty much as soon as she hit the pillow, wearing nothing but her socks. \n\nI tucked her in, played PlayStation in the den for a while to distract myself from my blue balls and the sounds of Kevin going at it in his room.  Finally I went back to the bedroom and went to sleep beside her. Next morning all three of them were hung over. Kevin had to work Saturday night, so plans were made to meet up later that week, which didn’t happen. \n\nFast forward about a month. \n\nAllison showed up at the door saying we needed to talk. We went back to my room and she explained that she was pregnant and was leaning towards keeping it and wanted to make sure she could count on me to support her and the baby. \n\nI started at her dumbfounded for a a bit and finally said. “ Uh. Not sure why you are telling me this, we never had sex.” She insisted that we had, but basically only vaguely remembered making out with me and her only clear memories were of waking up naked beside me and the the rest of that morning. I told her I would gladly take a paternity test when the time came as long as she paid for it, and walked her through exactly what had happened that night. She left in a huff. \n\nI never spoke to Allison again, but through the grapevine heard that that the lucky guy was the married cop she had hooked up with the following night. Had she not passed out and we had actually done the deed that night I probably would have just taken her word for it that I was the father, but of course in that scenario might have actually been.",

TLDR at the bottom.  \n\n\n\\[**Context\\]**: *I'm a 40 year old Gay man, and this story takes place when I was about 22 years old.*  \n\n\nThis might date me here but I was browsing [Craigslist.Com](https://Craigslist.Com) 's personal adds. I was quite adventurous at that time, and I didn't have a boyfriend back then. So, I often looked for N.S.A. hook-ups.  \n\n\nI found a profile for a man only 3 years older than me (*we'll call* **Brad**) looking for N.S.A. \"passionate hugging\". He was cute, and if his dating profile was anything to go off of, we'd hit it off nicely.  \n\n\nSince I couldn't host, we agreed to meet at a neutral location in my city's downtown area. When I got there, I saw him talking with a group of 5 other guys in our age-bracket or so. I initially assumed they were his friends. Well, it *was* true to an extent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurious, I asked who the other men were. He explained they were with him to also hook up, and the night's activities would involve a group. I thought in that moment, \"Okay...not *totally* against this.\"\n\n  \nI signal that, while caught off guard, I would go along with them. We start walking in the opposite direction of where he'd said his car was parked. We are now walking through the far seedier section of our downtown's \"LGBT\" district. This place would've been sketchy to anyone - let alone to gay men. I asked what we were doing, and he said he was going to take a little bit to score some coke, meth, and heroin! He wanted to make it an unforgettable night. To quite a Youtuber, \"This was a Cold-War Era, Soviet Propaganda Parade of Red-Flags.\" I might have been only just comfortable with the group thing, but drugs? Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said that I wasn't going to go through with it, and despite how much it would cost I'd be taking a cab home (*Uber didn't exist yet*) . He grew dark, and grabbed me by the shirt. He said, I wasn't going anywhere. He said that, because we met, and there was evidence of our conversation that might be enough to get me brought up on charges should they get caught. I gulped, as this going so far south, people could charter expeditions to find it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore much else could happen, over his shoulder, I saw a familiar face get out of a car. It was someone I'd fooled around with before. I saw my ticket out of there. I called to the man (*Lets call him* **Ted***.)* I called out to Ted, and said, \"Hey honey, you're here early. I wasn't expecting you for another couple of hours.\"  \n\n\nTed first looked very bewildered, but once we made eye-contact he remembered who I was, and seemed to read I was in trouble.  \n\n\n\"(He sighs) Ugh. I know, and I would've been able to give you more time, but the client's car broke down on the 5, or something. So, boss sent me home early. Didn't you say you had a date with somebody? Is this him?\"  \n\n\nBrad, stammered, but just nodded that he was \"the guy\" I had intended to meet.   \n\n\nTed walked forward, and hugged me. \"Are you going to have fun?\" Ted asked. I replied, \"Yeah, but can we stop by the house I want to pick up a few things. This party's going to be *wild!*\"  \n\n\nHe agreed, and took me by the hand and lead me back to his condo nearby.  \n\n\n\\[**The Aftermath**\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next afternoon, my local News Station reported that very same group of men were busted for major drug violations. Everyone got arrested, not just the ring leader. They took everybody in while they sorted out who had actually committed a crime. So, I'd indeed avoided a Czar Bomba to the face!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** While browsing [Craigslist.com](https://Craigslist.com) for NSA Passionate Hugging, I found a match. I went to meet him, only to find him with 5 other guys. Then he tells me he's off to score some pretty hard drugs and tries to blackmail me into joining in. I see a random guy I'd hooked up with before, that pulled me out of the fire, and took me home safe and sound.  \n\n\nIf anybody is curious: >!Yes, I did give my savior a good romp for his heroic deed.!<",

I was there with a guy I grew up with who had moved to Germany for work, and all of his European friends that he had made since he had been there. We had been partying at O-Fest since 9:00am, and we had drank just about enough of beer for the day, when I noticed some dude at our table was rolling a \"marijuana cigarette\". My German sucks, so I didn't say a word, but one of the Finns we were there with opened right up and asked the dude if he had enough to share. At that point, I got up to go to the bathroom and when I returned to our table everyone I was with wanted to head to the train station and get home to bed. On the way to the train station, the Finnish kid in our group put his arm around me and told me that he got some weed from the dude at our table, but he didn't need it because he had some at home anyway. So he took the weed out of his pocket and stuck it in my back pocket as we stumbled toward the entrance to the train station. The moment our group got to the bottom of the stairs leading to the trains there were six Polizei (German Police) waiting armed with submachine guns. They grabbed my friend and the Finnish kid, and very roughly threw them against a nearby wall and started rifling through their pockets asking them \"where the drugs were\". I stood there frozen, waiting for them to notice I was part of that particular group and search me too, but out of nowhere, the Finns' girlfriend grabbed me by the hand and said \"C'mon sweetheart, let's go home\" (in German ofcourse), and we boarded the train while my friend and her boyfriend were tossed by the cops. Obviously, the cops found no contraband, because it was in my pocket, so they let my pals go who then boarded the train white as ghosts from what had just transpired. As the train departed the station, my two pals were ranting and raving about how illegal weed is in Germany and how much trouble they would have got in if I wasn't the one smuggling the drugs in my pocket. I thanked the Finnish guys' girlfriend for saving my ass, and when we got back to my pals' flat where I was staying, I rolled that shit into the most rewarding joint I have ever smoked.",

We had been together for roughly five years at that time and were madly in love.\n\nWe were married in April and she announced in mid to late May that she was pregnant. She had taken a test with her friend after feeling sick. I was so happy and excited that I didn't take the time to ask to see the test - she had just thrown it away!\n\nFast forward a bit and she wouldn't let me attend doctor's visits and I gave her the benefit of the doubt for privacy and the such. But then she wasn't getting bigger at even the six month mark. I was suspicious and confronted her about it and she went off on me with the standard barrage of \"How could you?!\" and \"Don't you trust me?!\" And she pointed out some weight gain. I was skeptical but loving and supportive of my wife. She had a rough life growing up and I felt as if I needed to be more patient and understanding. I reminded her that I will help her find help if she's not really pregnant; that I would love and support her and we would work through it. She said it wasn't necessary.\n\nWifey started gaining weight more, especially in the belly so I kept going moving forward as if she was pregnant. We had a name picked out, a full wardrobe of the first three clothing sizes, a fully decked out bedroom, etc. My family was suspicious but still supportive.\n\nAround month 8 it was painfully obvious she was not pregnant. I had already found her ultrasounds on Google, the weight gain stopped (she had a pancreas issue that she couldn't even eat enough to gain much weight - she had to be making herself sick to gain), and our relationship was deteriorating fast.\n\nI was remarkably patient. The due date came and went and I asked what the doctor was saying: \"Oh it's ok - the baby can sometimes be up to two weeks past due!\" And I had my date. I gave it two weeks and then laid down the cold hard truth: Go to the hospital with me to see what's up with the baby/pregnancy or I'm gone right now.\n\nShe went. I was not allowed to go back with her (she requested the doctors do not share with me). Wifey had told the doctors that she was there for an issue related to her pancreas issues. Never mentioned the possible pregnancy. I was permitted to \"visit\" her in her room and I looked her in the eye and told her it was over.\n\nI took the bullet  - or rather shotgun blast from that issue. But I avoided being gaslit and manipulated for the rest of my life.\n\n**Edit: This blew up so I'm going to continue the story to the aftermath as I wrote in a couple of comments. Sorry for any formatting/continuity issues but I didn't want to edit the comments.** \n\nShe disappeared, took another man's name, and ran from the process server so I could not divorce her.\n\nWe're still legally married even though she lives as someone else's husband. I went through years of massive depression after this and I'm only just now in a financial and mental position to be able to finally solidify the divorce. That will be happening within the next year.\n\nShe also went around telling people that I lied, I'm a horrible person for abandoning her, and that I was abusive and it caused her to lose the baby. The day after I left she she came back to our house to gather things, attacked me, and then called the cops to say that I threw her to the ground. Luckily I knew enough not to be alone and had several witnesses to the situation.\n\nThat did not stop her from filing an emergency protective order to have me thrown out of our home after I had left her. She then emptied the house- all of which was paid for by me or brought to the relationship by me because she had nothing due to her situation growing up. I lost every heirloom, keepsake, and picture that I had saved from my childhood until I was \\~24.\n\nI lost it all. And to this day all I have to show for it is a reputation as an abuser and a severe distrust of relationships.\n\nI'm not OK. I still deal with the fallout from this on a daily basis sometimes. Check my other lengthy comment about the fallout and come back to this.\n\nI tried to leave the woman I dated after her. It took me 5 years to date again and the \"rebound' ended up getting pregnant early on. I tried to do the right thing and stick with her so my child would have two parents. She, too, ended up having mental health issues. Diagnosed while we were together. Hers showed in the form of child neglect and abuse. I ended up with full custody of my son (she hasn't seen him in two years!).\n\nThe fucked up part is that when I built my case and finally left the GF she reached out to ex wife to try to plot against me. They came up with a plan for my current GF to do the same thing that the wife did to me. She filed a false protective order, drained my house of all of my stuff (since GF didn't work..), and took my son and fled the state. GF said that I was regularly beating and raping her and my son. Luckily I had learned and had been keeping extensive records of everything to protect myself in the event that history repeated itself. I had records, messages, pictures, and witnesses the second time around.\n\nI've found it impossible to date since. I now have a reputation as an abuser and molester even though no charges were ever filed, the protective orders were thrown out of court with prejudice, and I won custody of my son from the 2nd relationship due to all of this.\n\nI won. But at what cost?",

He was swiftly promoted and the two of us would butt heads every other day to the point where I was made to look like a complete troublemaker (meanwhile I just pointed out inefficiencies and possible legal/regulatory abnormalities in their processes). His promotion, I would later learn, was due to his appointment having been aimed at restructuring the company to get rid of 'troublemakers' from the get-go. He was appointed to stir and eliminate.\n\nMyself and a few senior staff at the company were served with retrenchment notices. I was livid and wanted to take matters further, but the other 'retrenchees' told me to be patient. The staff who weren't retrenched refused to speak out or have our backs, they were pretty smug and feigned sympathy. For a moment I wanted to concede, give into their demands and beg to save my job and income, but luckily I didn't.\n\nThe CEO who retrenched the other seniors had bargained on majority shareholding as he'd assumed the other directors would sell their shares to him on exit (he had less than 50% at the time, and their shares will have secured his majority shareholding). He'd dangled a pretty juicy carrot in front of them. Instead, they collectively (and legally) sold/handed their shares to an opposition company and did so pretty stealthily. They did this months after I'd already left, so I wasn't there when the pawpaw hit the proverbial fan.\n\nThe retrenchment plan aimed at ousting us few to make a point and eliminate non-conforming staff backfired. I ended up with a pretty nifty settlement and given the nature of my exit I could immediately contact their direct opposition for a position. The staff who remained ended up under the employ of an international corporate entity - many had to accept demotions, pay cuts and/or were prompted to relocate. \n\nI won't have been in the same space in my career today had I grovelled and stayed on.\n\n**EDIT: grammar & spelling**",

Over the next few years my boyfriend became an alcoholic, never did find employment, and got progressively more and more violent and abusive. I managed to get away from him. His family was my main support system, so I imagine that would have been so much harder if I'd have had his baby.

When I started working at Amazon and Whole Foods her only response was \"What about me?\" \n\nAnyway, one night I'm leaving the amazon facility and decide to skip chit chat with a coworker because I'm exhausted and I really wanted to go home. I get to my car, pull up to the stop sign, make that left turn and get hit by some kid who was speeding in his moms Nissan Altima. It was a dark warehouse road with no street lights and they were going well above 90mph. Their car flipped over the divider, mine spun out like 5 times, hitting theirs again while I was spinning. All I remember is seeing the car go dark and gripping the wheel. When I came to, I had to crawl out the passenger seat before I realized something was wrong with my knee and my shoulder. I get taken to the hospital, get told I need surgery, etc etc etc. My girlfriends visits me and keeps me company. I cried a lot when no one was around, thinking about what I was going to do. \n\nI eventually get sent home in a wheel chair. The first night I'm home my girlfriend comes to visit and says she wants to take me for a walk (lol). She pushes my wheelchair to a bench a block from my house and tell me she needs to know if we're going traveling in the next 6 months or not, because for her it's mandatory. It's a need for her. It's something we've talked about before my accident but it's never been posed before as an ultimatum like this. At first I'm taken aback, trying to collect myself, then I pretty much told her to look at the situation I'm in. Yeah, I'd fucking love to go traveling but it isn't in the cards right now for me. If she needs that, she can find someone who can do that. She shuts right up. When she wheels me back my house, I tell her if she really wants that we can help her find a better paying job (I had two jobs paying me 15 dollars an hour, she can find one too). \n\nThat never happened. All she did was sit around and tell me that she doesn't feel like a priority and bring up traveling. Fast forward three months and I'm walking again, barely. I only work at whole foods now. One day she calls me to celebrate her completing therapy and we go get drinks and she tries to bring up traveling again. I just tell her how I feel overwhelmed with everything (my own debts and bills and then hospital bills) and this ends in an argument in her car with me telling her that it eats away at my self worth and makes me feel like shit. She apologized, got the water works, and we end the night. She calls me before bed and brings it up traveling again, this time begging. I broke up with her the next day. \n\nTwo weeks later, my dad finds a lawyer who can look at the accident case and finds a way to finesse the insurance and ends ups handing me a check that erases all my debt, three times over. This was right before covid started so I get to stay home and properly rest, emotionally and physically. Picked up Rollerblading and started studying again. \n\nEvery now and then I wonder how much money I would have wasted on that girl if I hadn't broken up with her. I like to assume I'm over that relationship but it still riles me up. That girl was an absolute heat seeking nuke.\n\nTL;DR - Getting hit by a car was the best thing that happened for my relationship and my finances.",

I never knew for sure, but do know that I saw firsthand his dad get threatened (at a tennis court of all places) by two well-dressed clearly-Italian men who drove up in a black Cadillac.

            "text": "Back in ~2004, when I was only 20y/o, I was on a road trip with my friend (& her dog) from California to Washington. I was on I-5 north at around 1:00am, using my cruise control to keep my speed at 75mph (speed limit is 70mph). \n\nI’d gotten speeding tickets in that part of Northern California before (I was familiar with this drive because my b/f was in LA and I lived in Seattle - so I made that trip a few times a year for a few years). All that is to say, I had learned my lesson and used cruise control to keep myself from speeding. Never going more than 5 over the posted speed limit. \n\nSo it’s pitch black, early morning. My friend has her seat reclined all the way, taking a nap on the passenger side, her dog on her chest. \n\nI see what I assume to be lights from a cruiser come up behind me. The car slowly pulls along side me, and matches my speed exactly. I kept my eyes straight ahead but I knew this person was staring at me. I wasn’t panicking tho, not like I had in the past when I’d encountered a cop on I-5, because I knew I wasn’t *really* speeding. \n\nI kept glancing at the speedometer to assure myself I was good. I may have even slowed down a notch or two, to be certain.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity of this cruiser just keeping pace with me, he finally slows down, swerves in behind me, and puts his lights on. \n\nAs I’m slowing down and pulling off to the shoulder, I nudge my friend awake and tell her I’m getting pulled over. She asks if I was speeding (she knew my history) & I assured her I was not, and had been using cruise control. I was really starting to shake by this point. Cops make most people nervous, but something just didn’t *feel* right about this stop. I knew there was no reason to pull me over. \n\nPitch black, middle of NOWHERE, hadn’t seen a gas station or rest area for miles. The guy strolls up to the passenger side of my car as my friend is using the lever to get her seat upright again. When he finally gets to the passenger side window, he looks visibly surprised that I have a passenger. He begins to fumble over his words, claims that I was going 90mph. He was so damn flustered he forgot to ask for my license. I actually *asked him* if he needed it. \n\nHe trots back to his car and my friend and I look at each other like, WTF? Her dog, btw, was going absolutely apeshit during this entire interaction. I never saw that dog act like that before or after this happened. \n\nNow remember: I’d gotten a few tickets on that same stretch of road, within that same year or two. I was very familiar with this process and knew how long it should take and what to expect. In my previous experience, most cops go back to their cruisers for a good 6-8minutes. \n\nThis guy came back after about 2 minutes. Kinda tossed my license and registration into my friend’s lap, like he was annoyed, and yelled at me to slow down and told me he’d just give me a verbal warning for now. I thanked him, despite how creepy it was, and while I was putting my license back in my wallet and registration back in my glove compartment, he fired up his cruiser and floored it back onto the highway. This is also NOT normal. Any time I’d been pulled over, they would always tell me to pull out ahead of them, so they could make sure I merged carefully back onto the freeway. \n\nMy friend and I were freaked. She was more freaked than me, I think I was trying to explain it away, give him the benefit of the doubt, at first. But the longer I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I became. I couldn’t shake that nasty feeling that something wasn’t quite right. \n\nFast forward many years later, I remember hearing about some cop that had been arrested. He’d been trolling I-5 N in Northern California (during that same time period I’d been on road trips), stopping unsuspecting young single female motorists, and sexually assaulting them in his cruiser. His M.O. was to pull up alongside their cars, scan them to make sure they were single females, and pull them over in desolate areas at early morning hours. He ended up murdering one of these girls when she put up too much of a fight. I can’t remember his name and I don’t know what he looked like, it was too dark to see his face well. But my blood turned cold when I’d heard that. Definitely dodged a huge nuclear life-changing (possibly life-ending) event thanks to my tired friend and her protective little dog.\n\nEDIT: I did not expect my inbox to explode over this! I am doing my best to reply to the comments, but maybe an umbrella edit is easier:\n\nMany of you are saying that you know this case from Forensic Files.. the case I believe you’re referring to is from the 80’s and happened in San Diego. So, this was an entirely different cop that I encountered.\n\nAs I stated above, I didn’t see the guys face. He wasn’t close enough to the side of my car thanks to my friend’s dog (not only that, I got the impression he was trying to make sure his face remained out of view). I have done some light googling today to see if I can pin point this situation better and find an actual news article to point to and say, “it’s probably this guy!” But I haven’t been able to find any such thing (yet).\n\nPart of the problem might be because I got the year wrong. I said 2004, because to the best of my estimation that’s when I believe this happened. That being said, it’s possible that it happened as early as late 2002/early 2003 or as late as 2007/2008. I made so many trips to and from CA <-> WA and that friend of mine joined me a 2-3 of those times, so I’m not 100% sure what year this took place. \n\nAnother problem? I also don’t know exactly where, either. I say I-5 N in Northern CA, it’s a big long state. There are a few good long desolate stretches along that highway that are pitch black at night, for miles. They always blurred together for me before, especially at night. But if I had to guess? This happened somewhere in the abyss before or after Redding, CA. \n\nScary thing I have discovered today: there are a sickening amount of stories just like this in the news, old and new.\n\nLast: thank you for all of these awards, completely unexpected and super appreciated. \nI seldom open Reddit up in the morning and I don’t think I’ve ever even commented on a Reddit post before 8pm. Today, when I saw that question, this memory from that road trip flooded me and I just shared it with exactly zero expectations for any response, let alone this. Stay safe out there! \n\nPRO TIP (thanks to those commenting):\nIf you ever find yourself alone on the highway, getting pulled over by the police and you feel in any way, shape, or form uncomfortable pulling to the shoulder, slow your car down, turn on your hazards, and call 911 (if you have no service, just keep driving until you do). Inform them of your predicament, they will relay this to the cop behind you who will gladly follow you to the safe place of your choosing to make a stop. Moreover, a 911 dispatcher will also be able to warn you that there’s no cop in that location, which means you should keep driving and wait for the real police to arrive.",

A car was passing 2 vehicles (including an 18-wheeler) on a 2-lane road, at night, with a double-yellow line, and was headed straight for us. My husband was driving, and he swerved off the road to avoid the collision. We missed being hit literally by inches. Thankfully, the other guy didn't also swerve or he still would have hit us, and the shoulder of the road just happened to be somewhat level where we ended up.\n\nI can only imagine how many people would have died if not for my husband's quick reflexes and sheer dumb luck. Of course, I'm having *yet another* panic attack just thinking about it.\n\n**Nuke #2, not me but my husband:** He and I were attending a local trade show, but he had to be there earlier than me so we arrived separately. During the show, he said he wasn't feeling well and was going home. At the same time, I was approached by someone who wanted to talk to me, so I told him I would be a few minutes behind him but I would see him at home.\n\nWhen I got home, he wasn't there. I called his cell phone, but got no answer. I called his office, but he wasn't there and no one there had seen him. I was frantic.\n\nAbout an hour later, I finally get a call from his cell phone, and it's a doctor from a clinic between the site of the trade show and our house (we both had been to this clinic before when we lived in that area prior). He said I needed to get to the clinic right away, my husband was there and he'd tell me more when I got there.\n\nTurns out, my husband started feeling extremely sick on the way home from the trade show, so he pulled over on the side of the road, in hopes that I would see him there on my way home and stop. He sat there for a few minutes waiting, but I never showed up and he felt like he was going to lose consciousness. Then he remembered that clinic, which was just a couple of blocks away, so he drove himself there and stumbled in.\n\nWhen he arrived in the clinic, he was in full anaphylactic shock from an allergic reaction to a medication that had recently been prescribed to him. They rushed him back and the doctor began working on him immediately. The doctor told me when I got there that if my husband had not shown up at the clinic when he did, he most likely would have died in his car waiting for me on the highway. Fortunately, they got some epinephrine in him just in time to save his life.\n\nEdited to add: Nuke #2 happened back in the days when cell phone use wasn't particularly widespread. If I'd had a phone, which I did not, all of this probably would never have occurred. Needless to say, I got a phone shortly after this incident, and my husband got an epi pen, just in case.",

We were both hood so it was a small tension I try to de escalate ,by talking to my boy about our jobs. One over heard something that caught their attention. One asked me what I did once I went outside for a cigarette. Knowing this could lead to something worse I engaged conversation until I finished my cigarette,as to not seem scare or avoiding. That could be insulting if I threw away the cigarette and walked away. \n\n I said I'm a cook ,but he misunderstood cook. I walk back into and he is asking me odd questions ,like how long have I cooked , am I any good. Me and my boy go out for another cigarette suddenly two man show up ,based on their beads I knew what gang they belonged to. They made a call,the man came out and said this is the man I told you, he is a good cook. \nThey approached me and ask if it was true, I got it right away. I said yeah  I am ,I have cooked for great restaurants in the city. I cook steaks ,fish and other places on the line. My boy got it too, we worked in restaurants, he was like yeah bro we even got our food & handling license. They was like ight ya good. We stood there smoking our cigarette.

To note, running perpendicular to the driveway was the busy street in the area. About 10 or 11 years ago, in the middle of a rainstorm at night, a cow got loose from the front pasture and my mom didn't want it to get hit by a car so she went to go try to rally it in. I'm in the middle of playing some video games so I don't really pay attention to the time but about an hour later she comes back soaking wet. She went to change and went to bed. We all go to bed and don't think anything of it. About 24 hours later after we get home from school, there's about 10 cop cars at the neighbor's house right across from our driveway (1/4 mile so neighbor is loose) and a police chopper. My mom goes down there alone to see what's going on. About 20 minutes later she comes back and we've been watching her talk with a cop. Turns out our neighbors were both murdered. Now here's where the nuke was dodged for my mom. \n\nWhen she went to get the cow, it turns out it got into the neighbors pasture across the street. Now our neighbors have always hated us for some reason. They had a lot of issues but there's a long history there. So my mom wanted to let them know where the cow was so she could come back the next day when it isn't raining or dark and get it. So she's prepared to get screamed at for no reason and knocks on the door and the wife neighbor answers. Apparently the neighbor was the nicest she ever had been and was saying stuff like \"look at you all soaked, come on inside and out of the wet and cold\". Saying other things like that to get her to come inside. My mom kept saying no and eventually left. Sometime briefly after that they were killed. So my mom told the cops this (and I believe the FBI showed up at one point a few weeks later), and they think that the killer was there behind the door and the neighbor may have been trying to get help. 10 or 11 years later, no one has been arrested and we still have no idea who did it",

My cousin C and I were 14 when this happened. \n\nTwo of my uncle's friends drove out from the city to visit. They had ideas of partying with Uncle, but he wasn't home from some errand yet, so they decided they'd wait for him. They asked my cousin C and I \"where's the nearest place to buy beer?\" We knew it was at least 15 miles away, and when we couldn't describe it well enough for them to understand, they invited us to ride along with them. Seemed like fun at the time. \n\nWe went to one of those tiny stores at a crossroads, bought two 12-packs of beer. Before we headed back to the farm, the guys were cracking beers in the car. They offered me and C beers, too, and of course, we took them. They drove with loud rock music playing, windows rolled down, yelling dude stuff to each other. When we hit the gravel road leading up to the farm, the driver was starting to do some crazy maneuvers, playing fishtail games and stirring up clouds of dust. C and I were getting sprayed in beer, centrifugal force throwing us around in the backseat (this was before everyone wore seatbelts). But it was great fun and we laughed and yelled and were having a bang-up time. \n\nSuddenly there was a bang and the car stopped and the sound of broken glass and the roof caved in on us. We had hit a utility pole so hard it snapped in half and fell over the car. An electric wire was snapping and sparking in the cornfield we were staring at. C and I were in the back seat, and the wreck had popped her door open. She stopped us all with \"NOBODY MOVE!\" Then she pushed the door open the rest of tge way with her foot, and said \"Okay, Snushine, you gotta jump clear of the car. Don't touch anything metal.\" I did exactly that. \n\nShe asked the guys in the car \"Are you okay?\" They both said they were. I said \"C, we smell like beer! We can't be here when the cops show up!\" So we ran the rest of the way to the farm, where we quickly jumped in the kiddie swimming pool and pretended we were playing in the water the whole time. In our clothes. Like 14 year olds are supposed to do.\n\n**After we left** After jumping free of the car like we did, one of the guys had the drunken dumb idea to grab the electrical wire that was laying on the car. It electrocuted him and grounded through a hole in his shoe. He had third degree burns and was taken away by ambulance. The other guy was traumatized forevermore after that. If C had not told me to jump clear of the car and not touch metal, I woulda been fried too.\n\nEdit: TL/dr...I almost was electrocuted after the car I was riding in hit a utility pole and became electrified.",

Tree was basically vertical, a few thousand pounds of wood balanced on its end, reaching thirty feet up. I made another cut, and the rest of the trunk slid down off the 3 feet or so of trunk that I’d separated it from at the base. And then it started to lean.

Movie was alright, we get back in my car and start the 15 minute drive to dinner when I ask what happened between her and her boyfriend.  She then goes to tell me about how she was afraid he was going to leave her so she poked holes in his condoms so she'd get pregnant and he wouldn't leave her but found out and ended things there and then, she had a mental breakdown and just got out of the hospital after being 941'd (involuntary mental health evaluation).

This was all organized by the school.\n\nA week or so before the internship started, some of the youth leaders came to the school to introduce us to their youth center and the area it's in. The one I was going to was in an area with a rather bad economic situation, which had led to crime. The fact that there's a youth center in such an area is a good thing, because part of what they're supposed to do is help the youth find a better path in life. This is what I'm studying to do.\n\nBut, naturally, I got worried about my own safety. I didn't want to get robbed, which had apparently happened in the area about eight times in the past month (at the time). But I was going to go through with it anyway.\n\nAnd then, the very next morning (and this genuinely is a coincidence) I get a call from my teacher saying that I'm going to get a new internship because mine had been burned to the ground during the night.

Spend 2-3 weeks(i dont remember it was a long time ago)in the house bored as hell(i was a very hyperactive kid). And the first day that i was able to get out i fell over a rock near an axe and cut my lower eyelid on a sharp rock on the ground. Got stitches etc etc,now i just have a scar,the eye is perfectly fine. When i was falling i held a brand new ps1 game in my hand. Being the kid i was i held the game in the air to avoid breaking it,not protecting my face. And as i got my hands in front of me,i pushed the axe out of the way(unintentionally)where my face landed. If it werent for that game i would have probably try to put my hands on the floor and landed directly on the axe with my eye. It would suck for my parents to see the horror of me without my eye and to live without one eye. May not be as cool as some stories out there,but its my two cents. Also my friend was messing around with some tough guy on the streets provoking him with his car(passing his car and then driving in front of him \"grandpa slow\" to piss him off). When we stopped at the red light we just saw the guy hitting our car window wanting to break it. I wanted to bust out of the car to knock his ass out,but my friend locked the car doors on his side(and i couldnt open it from my side). I was pissed at him for being a pussy but just as i was about to open the door bending on his side of the door where the lock control is,i saw him grabbing a huge ass knife from his car and walking towards us. As soon as we saw it we didnt even wait for the green light we just blasted out off the place as quick as we could. To this day i keep thinking how it could have turned out if i got out. Honestly my friends would always make some trouble and i had to solve the problem and now i see i was so lucky to leave it all \"unscarred\".",

Over the course of a few months I learned a lot about her (allegedly). She told me she had been addicted to meth prior to meeting me. She had worked several jobs so she could finish college while taking care of her severely autistic twin sister who had died (unknown cause) tragically the year before. It was like everyone in her family was dead or had disowned her, she said because she robbed her aunt who was taking care of her, after her mother died, of course. Everything about her was some dramatic tragedy that had forced adversity on her and caused her to turn to drugs, blah blah. But *she was better* now that she had met me. Anyway, long story short, another coworker who was familiar with this girl took me aside one day and told me her sister wasn't dead, that she is friends with her on facebook. I was kinda pissed that she was denying my girlfriend's sister had died and I blew it off. I thought she was just causing work drama. But as time went on I started seeing cracks in all these stories my girlfriend had told me. There was other drama in the relationship and we were taking a break. During that break I decided to do some facebook research of my own. It turned out basically everything this girl had told me was a lie. She didn't have a college degree, her mother and sister were not dead, her sister wasn't even autistic or anything. There's no telling where that relationship was going. \n\nOther lies she told me: she had a heart condition, she had epilepsy (and literally used this excuse once or twice A WEEK to get out of work) which she could only cure by smoking weed (lol), she literally lied to me that her baby cousin died at 2 yrs old, she never let me meet her older sister who she was living with. I just don't even know what was a lie and what wasn't. And she refused to ride in red cars and had other weird superstitions. She almost threw up in my car because I ordered food with ranch dressing on it.\n\nWhen I figured out the lie about her autistic sister, I just blocked her on my phone and I've never spoken to her since.",

I wake up the next day and still in pain, go to see the on campus nurses and they sent me for x-rays. Do all the x-rays and go home to wait for results.

I made some pretty ambitious offers, but was always bested by someone with more cash.\n\nFound a place that had been sitting on the market for awhile, which was immediately suspicious, but decided was worth investigating. It was located on the edge of town, near some high-rise apartments that were a little sketchy. I assumed that this explained why it was still on the market. But I've lived in more dangerous places (I used to live in Baltimore city, in a not-so-great neighborhood) and decided this was acceptable. The house looked great on the inside - recently renovated, shiny new appliances, three full bathrooms. So I put in an offer.\n\nBecause the market was so red-hot, it became commonplace for buyers to waive inspection contingencies entirely. I had already submitted several offers that waived inspection. But my realtor counseled me to leave it in this time - especially in light of the \"as-is\" disclaimer. I'm really glad I listened to him, because it failed inspection spectacularly. To give you an idea, at one point the inspector literally asked me if I wanted him to keep going, offering to prorate his time because he felt bad taking my money to continue inspecting this trainwreck of a home.\n\nI looked into the property group a bit more, and turned up a litany of complaints about shady/unethical business practices. So as loath as I was to return to getting my ass kicked in the housing market, I knew I had to walk away from the deal entirely. It would have ruined me financially and taken years off my life. Ended up buying a different house that is still a fixer-upper, but was priced accordingly so I'm not getting double-charged for repairs. And everything at least works, which wasn't true of this other place.\n\n*Caveat emptor.*",

Figured I was already there, might as well do a lap to see if anyone else was there. As soon as I got in there something felt off. Fifteen minutes in some guy gets pushy about buying me a drink, but he wasnt even flirting with me so it was weird. Agreed to a water. He comes back with a tumbler glass and than dips out. I toss the drink, get super paranoid, and bolt. As I get to my car another guy pulls in behind me (facing the wrong way, so he wasn’t just parking) and runs up to my passenger door. It’s already locked, I’m already pulling out, and it takes me about half way home to calm down enough to realize they weren’t the same guy but car guy was clearly coming for me. Pretty sure they tried kidnapping me. Don’t want to know the intentions.\n\nAnd this is why you listen to that gut feeling, no matter how ridiculous it seems.

            "text": "I dated some bad people in my late HS/early college years. I was abused, gaslit and cheated on by almost all of them (only one didn’t cheat, but the rest was still there). This was added onto by there ALWAYS being some sort of ex gf/“current” Gf drama that I would have to deal with. Eventually, I break it off with this dude who’s got a psycho ex he will not protect me from. Like I had to force him to get a restraining order at law enforcements insistence because she was batshit.( I’m still positive he was cheating with her but w/e) \n\nI start dating a guy I’ve known for awhile (like 5 years) we’re doing amazing, we get an apartment together and are still unpacking and everything, then suddenly he dumps me while he’s on vacation with his family 5 days before Christmas. I obviously am totally broken up over it and refused to see all the weird little things that has been happening up until the breakup. He had started playing weird stripper-focused games, being more harsh during sex (which I hadn’t really noticed bc I have ~trauma related kinks~ I guess lol) and just overall distant. During the breakup he blamed a lot of things on me which could have been solved if he had only spoken to me. Like dude, you could have 100% gone to the bar with your coworkers if you 1. Let me know where you’re going and when you think you’ll be back and 2. Text me back occasionally so I know you’re not dead. He also complained about a lot of my behaviors which I later found out was pretty extreme ADHD. \n\nAnyways..\n\nA few months later, he gets a new GF. An 18 year old Hs dropout who’s a local stripper and does cocaine off her coworkers tits. (I found out abt the coke later) I’m angry about it, but given my history with ex’s and just being bitter, I block her on Facebook, have a petty laugh about them with some friends (they have the same face, it’s wild asf) and then go on with my life. I wake up the next morning to find this girl has tried to add me on every other social media I had. I panic, then block her again. She then makes a second Facebook account disguised as one of those personal meme page things and then reaches out to me to tell me I HAD to come by the apartment because there was stuff of mine I just had to get right now!! I told her to have my ex drop it off with a person at the college we both knew and liked, bc he asked me to leave him alone and i wanted to respect that, and to next time have him reach out bc it was creepy that she had made a whole account over some random stuff. She starts blowing up and calling me names and telling me that he hates me and just being overall vile, so I remove that account too. I realized later on that she was trying to stir drama by having me show up “demanding” my stuff, which they wouldn’t have because all I left were my Xmas lights (thanks mom, I’m still mad abt those). Since that didn’t work, She ends up stalking me on alt accounts. A few weeks later, she has a friend DM me to threaten calling the cops over some old Instagram photos (which she had made a second account to stalk me on). I don’t take the bait and I just block block block. She then uses my ex’s account to try the same thing again! Three months after they start dating they get engaged and married. I know she still stalks me due to her liking and unliking my pictures randomly, but it’s like. If I hadn’t just blocked her and then slipped into the role of a brick wall, I would have likely been framed to a lot of people as the crazy ex gf, and also could have damaged a lot of relationships with other people, both personal and professional. I don’t interact with them at all and luckily haven’t seen them at all since the last time I saw my ex, but was told that she was really angry that I wouldn’t take the bait and feed into her drama like she wanted. She wanted to be a victim so badly lmao. \n\nSupposedly the ex is happy with his “wifey” (🤮) but keeping up with his mom occasionally, and seeing recent family pics leads me to believe otherwise. (Mom set it up so they can be cut out of the pics suspiciously easily, and announced his brother’s marriage but not his?) I also heard he smokes weed now from my FIL , which is a big step for him and I’m proud lmao. (I’m hoping it’s weed bc I’ve heard she does a lot of other drugs and while he’s a dumbass I don’t want him to be doing coke and shit)",

One of the courses in my degree plan was a crime scene investigation lab, taught by this professor. It included real crime scene photos from real cases he had worked locally, and he spoke in great detail about the cases. It was really neat. \n\nRewind to a year prior to this - my roommate and I wanted to move off-campus together and we were looking for an affordable place. We found a trailer for rent in a trailer park for only $500/month, which was super affordable compared to apartments and houses in our town, and we didn't care that it was in a trailer park. It was a quiet trailer park, and clean, and it seemed like mostly old people lived there. And it would be an entire trailer to ourselves... quite a bit more space and square footage for two people than what we would have gotten in an apartment for twice the price of rent. Ultimately however - and I can't do this day explain why - we both just felt uneasy about the whole thing after going to look at the place. There was nothing wrong with the property, it was clean and well maintained and $500/mo seemed like a total steal. But, we both got the heebie jeebies from the place and had no clue why. So we passed. \n\nSo here I am a year later taking this CSI lab, and the professor starts flipping through crime scene photos from a case he had worked a year and a half prior. He says \"here's some photos from one of the worst I ever worked\". He starts flipping through them, and immediately the place looks eerily familiar. It's the trailer my roommate and I *almost* moved into, and where I would have been living at that exact moment when I took this class had we not gotten inexplicably weirded out by it. He says \"this guy had held captive two underage girls, and had constructed a satanic shrine in the back bedroom, and forced the girls to engage in occult sex rituals with him.\" And he shows a photo of the shrine, in the room which *would have been my bedroom* which had a giant pentagram drawn in blood on the wall and a bunch of strange trinkets and candles organized in weird patterns, as well as deer antlers and tree branches. Like.. some real life True Detective season 1 shit. Apparently they had raided this place and caught the guy, and this was what they found when they got in there. My professor said in his 30 years on the job, it was the weirdest scene he had ever seen.\n\nNo wonder the rent was so cheap.",

I changed jobs to get something that was stable, had great benefits, but had a significant pay cut for at least the first 6 months to a year (before promotions might catch me back up). I could have easily crashed and burned at the new job, too, while the old job was trivial. I gave notice and they made me a generous offer to stay, but I didn't really trust the owner to stick to any promises.\n\nThat was November 2019. Yeah.

I'm pretty big and intimidating at night. I delivered to an abandoned house in a crappy neighborhood at about 1 am, stood in front of the door confused for a few moments, then left. The next day, a couple of plainclothes detectives came in to talk with the manager (first time seeing cops out of uniform; kind of cool).\n\nApparently, minutes after I left, a much smaller and robbable Domino's employee showed up at the same address and was attacked by a teenager with a baseball bat. I think the cops just wanted to get the time of delivery on paper to show that the genius behind this crime spree had called multiple places at the same time in hopes of multiple payouts. It's kind of creepy knowing that some idiot a third of my size was stalking me from the bushes the whole time and I had no idea. I wonder what I would have done; how badly would I have hurt him, or would I have just taken the bat and chased him off? Who knows.\n\n**Dodging a tomato:** I was renting a couple rooms in an old house for a few years while I was getting out of debt. We had a shared bathroom (I know, not fun). The toilet was known to lean a little bit, which is usually not a good sign. About a month after I moved out, the toilet collapsed through the floor into the subfloor (like 6 inches, nobody was hurt). They had to have someone come in and completely redo the floor. I can just imagine being the one taking a dump when the toilet falls through the floor; like, no, I'll pass thanks.",

For a few months, it was fine, but quickly started to go downhill. Turns out that long hours working from 10pm to 7am, then 8am, then 10 am, then noon makes it difficult to sleep, which makes the work take longer, and you can see the pattern. During late summer into fall, I started to develop real bad depression,  to the point that I started to plan out how. The plan was to do it in February.  Fast forward only to mid October. \n\nIt's yet another terrible night after weeks of long, 12-15 hour days, 6 days a week. A few key individuals called in sick, so we're operating with the B team. My field (was) precast concrete, basically making the panels for building offsite and they'd get shipped to location to be erected. One person orders too much concrete, and the person who is supposed to get rid of this fresh concrete goes on break first, and leads to a whole bunch of issues. Skipping some details, we decided to use a forklift to life a material bucket over a front end loader bucket and dump it directly into the loader bucket.  Unfortunately, the forklift \"forks\" were not tilted back, causing the material bucket to slide forward and off the forks. More unfortunately, I was directly in the path of the material bucket as it fell. Later, we did the math and it turns out 4.5 tons(9000 pounds, or 4000 Kg) landed on my leg and pinned me in place.  The only reason I didn't lose my leg or my life at that moment was sheer dumb luck, as the piston that tilts the end loader bucket forward/back caught the brunt of the weight.\n\n All in all, it was 5 months of rehab, 70 pounds of fat gained (severe depression combined with a sudden inability to move meant I tried to eat my feelings) lead to me getting better mentally and physically. Still working on the fat loss, but I'm getting there, one step at a time.\n\nTl ; dr: was suicidal, got into a nasty accident at work, which helped me eventually get better.",

I was working on a truck when one of the older guys came and asked me for help installing a fuel tank on the truck he was working on. So without a second thought I slid under the truck and helped him line up this fuel tank using a floor jack to lift it while he bolted it in. After it was installed he slid out from under the truck while I lowered the floor jack. Suddenly the whole truck comes crashing down on me pinning me under the handle of the floor jack and the side of the truck pinning my legs. I remember hearing yelling and seeing feet running back and forth. They were able to get the lift operational and lifted the truck enough for me to slide out. Had I been near the wheels or still under the tank I would have been crushed.  Luckily I walked away with some bruises on my abdomen and legs. \n\nApparently what had happened was the lift we used had an air leak, and the person that lifted the truck didn’t put the safety pin in it to stop it from falling like that. \n\nMoral of the story is always, ALWAYS, check that a vehicle is properly jacked up and secured before you ever get underneath it.",

The jobs kept food at the table, but when you're working in front of a PC for most of the day, it can get very repetitive.\n\nBy 2019, I was really bored and hated my current workload. Felt like I was writing the same articles, filling them up with the same keywords, advertising the same sponsors my clients took. Drawing commissions also felt dreadful as they were the same business logos and nothing was ever original.\n\nSo I started looking for something new to do. At this point, I had 7 years of writing and drawing experience on my resume - but not much else. I couldn't really sign up for other jobs since I have zero experience.\n\nSo I started looking for writing/drawing work that would be different from what I was doing. I spread my resume and portfolio online, and after a while a recruiter from China talked to me about a job. They're a company that makes children's books, and they were building a group of writers to make a variety of books that they can sell to pre-schoolers. \n\nI've always wanted to write a book, and with my illustration experience, I was a 2-in-1 deal. But there was a twist. The company wanted their writers to fly to China and make the books there. The writers will have paid lodging, good compensation, and will stay there for a year while they do the books.\n\nThe idea sounded great, maybe a new location would reignite my passion for my work. But at the end I declined. Moving to China, the language barrier alone, was too big of a leap. I was also feeling lazy about the idea of collecting all my things and shipping them off to a different country.\n\nHere's the kicker. It's June 2019, the offer for the 1-year job was in Wuhan, China. The coronavirus started surfacing around November that year (?), which would have left me at the epicenter of the pandemic.\n\nInstead of accepting the job, I just started playing World of Warcraft to pass the time lol. I eventually found a local writing job as a technical writer, which reinvigorated my love for writing. But yeah, that's a big bullet dodged.",

While we were together I lost my best friend to cancer and was an emotional wreck. While my friend was dying she moved across the country to a different school than I went to and immediately became distant. We broke up once then and got back together at Christmas. It all ended up with us living in the college town I went to over the next summer where every single day she used the knowledge of how much I cared to manipulate and make me feel like shit. It didn’t help I was on a medication that made my anger worse that was supposed to help me with depression when I was actually misdiagnosed and had pretty severe anxiety. It was one night where she was putting on her little act to make me feel like shit and I lost it on her in public. After that I realized staying with her was going to result in me either getting arrested or my shit kicked in because of how often she tried to play on my temper. We stayed together like one more month and broke up when she went back to her school. I really cared so I spent some time well into the next year trying to understand what I did wrong and then I realized she was never that into me and I should stop caring. I’ve been in a loving relationship since then for 5 years. There’s a lot more to this story but I don’t want to pull a my crazy ex girlfriend because frankly I think we were just awful for eachother. I jokingly refer to her as my Tammy 2 with friends. I brought out the worst in her and she brought out the worst in me.",

When doing my full upgrade, I came to the conclusion that it's a bad time to upgrade with PCIE4 in its infancy, direct storage coming about in a near future and no idea what CPU requirements games made for next gen consoles first will have on PC, so I decided that I shouldn't invest in expensive CPU, MB and SSD but instead just plan an earlier upgrade this time (I usually upgrade once in a 5 years). If I didn't buy the GPU early, I would've probably went for a cheaper GPU as well. Well, thank fuck I didn't get a cheaper GPU at the time, there's no way I can upgrade now but my 2070 supports anything that is around and will be around in the next few years. \n\nYou may think that not having a good GPU is not a tactical nuke dodged, but I spend A LOT of time gaming, despite having a full time job and a family. I still manage to find over 30 hours a week for gaming (usually more). I really care about that sort of shit and I'm absolutely in the clear.",

The city was in the news over the last year or so as a point of contention in the election. \n\nWell back then, in the early 80s, the Southwest was going through a major housing depression. Our small peaceful city was flooded with troubled people from out-of-state. In our quiet neighborhood a couple of kids moved in that had a background in gangs, drugs and a bit of crime. They were nice to us though. We were a little bit socially awkward. We became friends. \n\nThey proceeded to break into houses in our neighborhood. They would invite us on their crime sprees and we would decline each time. And each time it would get a little bit harder as we spent more time with them. We were not very smart. We were young and impressionable. And they represented a bit of safety in numbers in a city that was becoming more and more segregated and violent. I remember going to school, and the front door was riddled with bullet holes. We had the second biggest teenage pregnancy rate in the whole state. (Ironically, my hometown was one of the safest cities in America some 40 years later)\n\nMy mother raised us as a single mother and later married into the military. Our stepfather transferred immediately out of the country. Never moved addresses, much less move to new country. Was an eye opening experience. \n\nHowever it was about a year later that I got a newspaper clip from my father. The older brother of my friends was killed in a gang fight in the street in front of my old house. The younger brother, who is a bit brash, had gotten into a fight with gang members from a couple of blocks away. They rushed him in the streets and the older brother who was trying to go straight and was attending Community College, came running out of the house to defend his younger brother. He was immediately stabbed in the neck and died in the street. \n\nHad I still been living there, I may or may not have been home that day. I may or may not have heard the ruckus. And I may or may not have run out also to help defend a friend. I went on to join the military, got a scholarship, became an officer and joined the Special Operations Community.

I had a lot of insight into the performance of the company, and knew they weren’t long for this world, so I had made it clear I wanted out, but couldn’t find anything else at the moment to jump ship to. They were also riddled with sexual harassment claims and had debt collectors constantly calling/knocking on our doors, which should’ve been a red flag for all involved.\n\nSo the day comes that they do a “small” layoff of about 10-12 people, but the ones they let go were pretty massive arms of the company or even friends of the owners (the company employed about 200 people at the time). So, I walked into HR, asked if I was let go, and they were flabbergast I even asked - insisting that this was a small, necessary layoff in order to really kick business in gear, and that they were planning well into the year ahead and beyond. I saw right through the bullshit and asked that if they so happen to have another layoff, that they put me on that list. The head of HR was surprised at my request, but we were pretty tight, so I think there was a mutual understanding of what I was asking/implying, and he said, “Sure.”\n\nSure enough, not two months later, there was another layoff, and I get the word that I was getting let go, with full severance and two years of unused vacation time to be doled out to me in 3 separate payments (the company couldn’t afford to pay it all at once). On my way out, I told my team to look for something new immediately, as this was likely the last layoff they were going to have. I don’t think any of them believed me, as they were SURE that another, much larger company was going to buy them out, and they’d cash in their stock options and become millionaires. I wished them good luck, and skipped my way out of there and shortly found a better job.\n\nIt didn’t take long until the company went completely bankrupt, and the entire staff was let go without severance or any sort of payout. We found out they were about $100M in debt and had a complete restructure. Most of the folks who were left out to dry, couldn’t find work for more than a year, and the few who did ended up at places with major pay cuts. I kept warning them well after I left the company, as they were my friends, but no one took heed, and you can tell there’s a bit of remorse for not seeing the writing on the wall the entire time.\n\nI dodged a major nuclear bomb by not having to move away from my high cost of living city, and giving myself the money and time to find a job I’ve been very happy with for a couple of years now.

Her face pale as snow. She looked so terrified and dead inside, it gave me chills even before I realized what's going on. She cried \"she's choking\" and handed our 5 month old baby girl over to me. So as I later found out, she was breastfeeding and the baby fell asleep but kept sucking milk, as they do. But since she was asleep, something malfunctioned and she choked.\n\nSo here I am, holding my baby girl, she's fucking terrified, eyes wide open, NOT BREATHING. I was not prepared for this. My zoom meeting gtfo'd in nanoseconds and my thoughts were rushing. The clock was ticking and I estimated that she was holding her breath for like 20 seconds to this point and that I have probably 20 more remaining. I've seen the heimlich  manoeuvre on TV and that was the first thing that I decided to try. I flipped her on her belly and gave a few pushes. Did not work. Then I put her down on the couch on her side and did it again. She coughed and started breathing again, mouth foaming with milk, but breathing.\n\nAt this point, my hands and legs just gave out and I just slid on the floor from the couch with relief. I swear this was the most frightening and stressful experience in my life. My wife was in tears, my hands were shaking for the next 2-3 hours.\n\nI know that I probably did everything wrong and there are methods to deal with this, but at the time, that's all I could come up with.\n\nSo yeah.

We were SO ready for that!\n\nThen early november rolled around, and my moms car broke down. And 90% of the holliday budget had to be used for the repair. We were absolutely devastated but my mom was determined to make up for it. We booked a cheap trip to mallorca as a consolation and left on december 25.\n\nThere we rented a small car and spent our days driving around the islands, discovering beautiful corners, i snapped an AWESOME picture of a palmtree infront of a snowpowdered mountain. The hotel was cheap as hell, we had barely any amenities, the only luxuary we had was the cafe de palma every day where we ate cake that tasted absolutely heavenly. the whole holyday for 3 people was i think around 500-700 euros at the time. it was only a short 5 day trip but it was a great time and i loved fireworks so i was absolutely fine with being back for the 31.dec\n\nSo fly back home unpack and settle back, have lunch. after which we turn on the TV (our hotel didnt have one and we didnt keep up with the news) And the evening news come up.

We stayed in Rome for about 5 days until getting on a plane and heading back to the US. Customs and everything was basically empty, the only thing even related to Covid was a single question before boarding the plane in Italy, was just “have you been to China recently” or soemthing like that. I vividly remember a friend texting me when I first got to Rome saying “hey aren’t there outbreaks and lockdowns in northern Italy right now?” And I just remember responding like “pffft what are you talking about I was just there, there’s no lockdowns” because I had been there not even 5 days ago but then when I got home 5 days later I saw the news of all of Italy being locked down and thought “holy shit there was outbreaks in Italy, wild”.

Oh my god, I am so happy we did it. The roof, which had been \"replaced\" had been installed completely wrong. Like literally shingles falling off, two enormous dead trees in the front yard, the water heater was leaking and fifteen years old, massive issues with the foundation that the flippers had tried to fix but also hadn't done properly - just cheaply. All of the \"major\" repairs that needed to be done with City approval, the permits hadn't been pulled, leaving us, the new homeowners, responsible for any fines had the City found out.\n\nThe house was listed at 150,000. We would have had to probably another 50k into the house to actually get it to be livable. As anyone can guess, we backed out of the contract and saved any other interested people from the same nightmare/money sink because the inspection stays with the house until it's sold.\n\nIn the end, we ended up buying a new build.

They wanted to pack while I wasnt home so it wasn't awkward, we had a room we used for storage and they decided to go through all of my stuff, take anything if value, and fill the boxes with shit it hers she didn't want. She also decided to abandon her cat and move to Texas with a guy shed secretly been dating behind my back. Didn't find out about the stealing for years when I was looking for my grandmother's onyx and silver bracelet she gave me years ago. I wanted to wear it to her funeral. I also found out while going through some old micro SDs for storage that they had been editing our messages and audio clips from arguments we had in order to make me look like a raging, controlling lunatic and had even done the same with the guy she was dating when we met so the whole grounds of our relationship was a lie from the get go. Within the year of me finding all this out she calls me crying because her boyfriend was secretly cheating on her the whole relationship and she wanted to move back with me. Fucking nope! Even if that is true, karma's a bitch, bitch! They are now back to living in our home town in a relationship with one of my childhood best friends. Tried to warn them about her but that fell on deaf ears just like when her ex tried to warn me. I was engaged to this person with a month before we where supposed to marry and I'm just so damn glad I am no longer trapped in that nightmare. they'd been gaslighting and controlling my actions from the get go leaving me a shell of a person when they left. I had to re learn how to properly talk to people because I'd been programmed to not do anything she considered a red flag forcing my brain to walk on glass around everyone making me into a walking talking to red flag to a normal person. Just remember no matter how cute someone is, no matter how good they treat the waiter, no matter how sweet their family thinks they are, deep down they can still be a fucking monster.\n\nI know this doesn't seem like a bomb to most people but to me now outside the relationship thinking about it- it was a waking nightmare. 4 years of my life where I didn't get to choose a goddamn thing in it other than where I worked. Saving up to built a future with someone for that long that didn't give a rats ass about me. That was the very last thing they told me as they left. \"I don't care about you and I never loved you, keep Calcifur (cat) because he likes you more\" followed by 2 years of trying to kill myself with heavy drug use to try and make my god damn feelings for someone who wouldn't piss on me if I was on fire go away and slowly building myself back up out of the pit of disparate created for myself because I felt I deserved it for not being good enough for them. I'm lucky to have the friends that I do that came to let me realize that I'm a lot better off on my own than with a monster like that or I'd never had made it out.\n\nIt's fucked up that emotional manipulation of that sort is totally legal. Someone can lie to you and leech of you for years and in the end tell you it was all made up with no repercussions and just jump to their next victim. \nLeast time makes us all ugly on the outside so eventually they will have nothing. Or who knows, maybe they will change who they are. I want nothing to do with them anymore and I don't know if it's their years of manipulation talking but deep down I want them to change because that can't be a happy existence. Maybe they truly don't feel emotions the way most people do. Who's to say .-. life's fucking weird my dude, just when you think you've prepared yourself for the worst of it it pumps another round into your chest cavity",

I had started a particularly hard semester in college and we were hanging out every afternoon. As expected, some of these times I was tired and not very talkative. He did not take this well.

One night, he pressured me into having unprotected sex with him. When I asked him why on Earth should we risk me getting pregnant at 19 years old and risking my college degree, he replied that his own pleasure was more important. I started taking BC shortly after.!<\n* He would break up with me about every three months, and come back two days later.\n* I got sick for a week. I still showed up to school and still met up with him on Friday (we always met on Fridays). Because I was sick, I was getting out of breath while walking around town, and had to stop and sit a couple times. When we got home, he told me that I was sick and tired all the time, and that he didn't want a fucking baby.\n* After graduating high school, he couldn't hold any studies or a job. No shame in not going to college, but there was nothing he could finish. Trade school, art school, jobs, nothing, he'd drop out in three months. That didn't affect me per se, but it was hard for me to picture a future together, especially considering that I paid for every date, and he stayed in my place while I went to class (I lived alone) and ate all of my food, leaving me with none for the week.\n* He told me he was going to live with some former roomates of mine who I had had a lot of trouble with.\n* He wanted an open relationship, which I was fine with, but he did not want me to be with others. Open on his side only.\n* He told me that I needed to \"seduce him\" and put in work to make he like me. \n* He was obsessed with the fact that I wasn't \"strong\" and would reprimand me all the time for not being strong enough, both physically and emotionally. \n* As the final straw, he started doing drugs.\n\nAt some point I completely checked out of the relationship, just let him do whatever he wanted, and whenever he threw a tantrum I just went through the motions and waited for it to pass.

I don't know why, but the old lady decided to just stop in the middle of the road around the cones rather than just continue her normal speed (there were several car lengths between us and the next cars ahead). I barely braked in time to avoid hitting her. Then, I saw the tactical nuke in my rear view mirror: a fast moving semi that hadn't hit the breaks yet. I closed my eyes, I was in a small sedan and thought between the large SUV and the semi, death was coming for me.\n\nI heard the loudest screeching I've ever heard. I opened my eyes. The semi had stopped inches away from my car. I have no idea how it stopped in such a short space. I'm happy to be alive, but to this day, I still have nightmares reliving this moment.

The ceiling was arched and had multiple skylights, and it just had an overall nice layout for a young guy. The apartment included water, trash, and sewer, and it came to a grand total of 450 dollars a month. I was making 40 an hour so it was GREAT.\n \n*well*\n \nA couple years ago I was working Tuesday to Friday, and I typically took naps on my Monday afternoons. One Monday in November I got up early, 7am, to take my dog to her first teeth cleaning at the vet. I figured, hey, I've got a lot of time now. I'm gonna clean the apartment! I swept, mopped, washed the mountain of dishes, cleaned the bathroom, did laundry, etc. I got *everything* done. I just so happened to have a lunch meeting scheduled for 2pm, when I would usually nap, so I left at about 1:50.\n \nI get to the restaurant down the street and meet up with the person I was there to see. The *second* my food hits the table, I got a phone call. It's my friend who works for the town, and he says he's pretty sure my house is on fire. I said uhh.. I was just there and it wasn't. He says I should go check.\n \nSo I dip out and race down the street to an apartment that, indeed, has thick black smoke billowing out the bedroom window. I thought, \"oh shit, well the fire department is on the way and this will be handled quickly.\"\n \nNnnnahhh. Soon the flames broke through the roof and it became apparent that it was a lost cause. All I could think, though, was how lucky I was to have had that meeting when I would normally be asleep. How lucky that my dog was at the vet. How lucky that my pregnant babymama was at work and not there. \n\n*THAT* was one giant, tactical nuke I dodged there.\n\nTl;dr: apartment burned down when I and my dog should have been home but weren't",

I pulled up to the light to turn left onto the road where my apartment was and I was so out of it that I didn’t even recognize the fact that even though it was a green light, the left hand lane had a red turn signal. I casually (but relatively slowly) made the turn and a massive pick up truck going 60-70 flew by me, missing my small Honda Accord by about five feet.

Lol.” It took me about an hour of sitting on the couch back at my apartment to really process the fact that I had escaped death by mere feet.\n\nEven if you’re not drunk or under the influence, it’s still not alright to drive when you’re out of it or sleepy.

Unfortunately, that was all that I was for a long time. 7th grade (she was in 6th) we made it “official” like we’re in middle school, nothing is official. A week into us “dating” I find out she’s also “dating” a guy on my wrestling team. That shit hurted, I remember hearing a lot of So Sick by Neyo in that time.\n\nFast forward to my Sophomore year and her freshman year in high school. We hadn’t talked very much since the whole heartbreak incident. Apparently, I hadn’t learned my lesson cause when she walked into wrestling practice, I felt head over heels again. We started talking non stop for months. My friends, my mom, and some of my exes didn’t let me forget what had happened last time. I didn’t care, asked her out during the State Tournament at the end of the season.\n\nSix months in, she gets grounded by her parents for sneaking out to see some other guy. I was stubborn and in love, so I forgave her, she swore nothing happened…so nothing happened right? That summer we barely spent any time together, I fell into a deep depression but didn’t know at the time why. We had the toxic type of relationship that was on again off again. Out of the blue she would text me saying she lost feelings and it was over. Two weeks later, we were back together. I do admit I should’ve seen the red flags but I had convinced myself that I was going to marry this girl. \n\nSenior year was the roughest of my life. There was a very nasty rumor about me going around the small town High School I went to. Ended up actually going to court where a judge ruled in my favor; after my Senior year had been ruined. My relationship was great when it was great, terrible when it wasn’t- no in between. I was depressed at this point. I knew I had made the wrong choice, but I made a choice god damn it. I’m not going to give up. That was when I she told me the truth. Every time she “lost” feelings for me, she’d go off and have sex with: her ex, my so called best friend, my teammates, and the guy that she snuck out with two years ago. My sigma frame was shattered and I went full beta and forgave her /jk. I clung on to the shred of hope that once we were out of high school things would change.\n\nI moved off to University with a knot in my stomach. She was a senior, a very popular, attractive, and disloyal senior. There was no trust between us, she feared I’d retaliate and cheat on her, I feared she never stopped cheating on me. It took 3 months for our relationship to completely fall apart. I kept seeing this dude on her Snap Stories. I tried not to think about it, and understand that you can be just friends with the opposite sex. The familiar doubt was always in the back of my mind. She took the dude to a school dance, even though I practically begged her to just take me, her boyfriend of 3 and a half years. \n\nA couple weeks after the dance the dude (a former teammate and her best friend’s ex) told me what’s been going on. A week after I left for college was the first time they hung out. A month was the first time they had sex. Ever since, they were practically dating and everyone except myself knew. That was my rock bottom, I felt so embarrassed. I had saved up and bought a ring and was planning on proposing at the end of her senior year. Not now!\n\nWe officially called it quits. I found out a lot about myself, did a lot of soul searching. She ended up getting pregnant in her Senior Year by that dude. He left her before the kid was born, flew across the country in fact. And even though I’m in a committed, happy, and healthy relationship now, she’ll still text or call out of the blue trying to rehash old memories. I dig up old hurtful messages she sent me, screen shot them, and send them to her. I am not gonna fall for that trick ever again.",

That said, I had safety rules to minimize risk and prevent unnecessary harm to others. One key safety rule was that I would never pass anybody at a greater than 10 MPH speed difference on the freeway, so if I were in traffic I’d be a good motorist and safely deal with said traffic.\n\nThe reason for this rule is that drivers are unpredictable and it’s completely understandable if they don’t see some numpty behind them going 180 mph right before they pass them. Last thing I needed was to end up in someone’s back seat because they made a lane change.\n\nOne late evening I was enjoying the bike on a mostly empty stretch of interstate hitting speeds of over 150 MPH, occasionally slowing down for traffic so I could accelerate back up again when I encounter a semi with trailer. I slowed down and started to pass at my reasonable speed when the truck started to move left into my lane like it didn’t see me in it’s blind spot.  Because I didn’t have enough momentum to complete the pass and I was in the wrong gear for a burst of acceleration I got on the brakes as I was squeezed out of the lane and on the narrow strip of pavement to the left of the yellow line. I could have reached out and touched the tires on the trailer.\n\nI moved over to the right hand lane to pass thinking he just didn’t see me. He immediately moved back, at which point it was obvious that he had just tried to kill me.\n\nSo I dropped it into the appropriate gear and shot past him fast enough that he couldn’t hurt me.

She didn’t have a car with her, and I knew she didn’t attend college where we were going to. I’d come back from the gym after classes and I’d find that the bathroom floor and shower were wet even though I absolutely knew none of us three who lived there had been home all day. Finally I approached Roommate Y and we both agreed that we needed to confront X and this girl because we were pretty sure she had no where to go, maybe needed help, etc.\n\nX gets home and we all sit down and have a talk. Turns out X is wondering the exact same thing we are and was about at his wits end, and the girl tells us she’s from out of town and has no way of getting home, which seemed odd because she apparently had a ton of friends here who could have helped her out as well. I texted one of her friends that I mutually knew and she wasn’t even aware that this girl was still here and thought she had left for home the prior Sunday. X ended up taking a day off and driving her back home a few hours away.\n\nA few weeks later I get texted by the same mutual friend. Turns out the girl was wanted by local police back home for domestic abuse and child endangerment and was arrested just a few days after X drove her back home. In the end we found out she and her boyfriend were heavy drug users and she had a history of hitting the kid, resulting in the boyfriend and her fighting and she fled. Kid’s school reported the kid’s signs of abuse hence the cops getting involved and getting the boyfriend to press charges.

That's not really a relevant detail, but I just like remembering that during all of this I was wearing a Victorian nightgown that I had yet to add fake bloodstains to (I'm always super ahead of the game for Halloween). I get a text from him, the first communication since a very simple May the Fourth text (my friends and I are all huge nerds). It was a curious text, asking me if I ever missed being together. I wasn't honestly sure what exactly to say, so I had my mom help me. What started as an attempt to possibly win me back turned into him trying to convert me to Christianity in the span of about 10 minutes. Even my mother, who grew up Catholic, was shocked and a little scared. She told me to just stop replying at that point. I didn't speak with him for a very long time after that. My Christian friend who lives in Texas (and is closeted) told me that what he did was very out of line when I told her what happened.\n\nWhen junior year of online learning started, that was the first time I had seen his face since March. He looked like a missionary with a whole new haircut and glasses (he never wore any before that) and I legit went into a panic mindset for a solid few hours after that. My friends helped me to calm down and I appreciate the hell out of them. \n\nTo the earlier point for clarification, I'm not Christian and had no intention of ever being one (he was fully aware of this). I grew up respecting all religions and I absolutely still do because there are good and bad people in religions, even if I'm a pagan leaning person. But another detail that I wanna mention is that around the time I was breaking up with him, I was seriously questioning my sexuality and have since accepted that I'm bi with a preference for women. He still doesn't know and likely never will, especially because his conservative values were massively exacerbated during that phase of the pandemic when everyone was at each other's throats. That dark part of me sometimes imagines him seeing me with another girl and possible scenarios of that. I honestly never saw him as a bigoted person, but so much has changed that I'd rather not test it.\n\nOne of my oldest friends whom I've known since kindergarten even told me at the start of this year that my ex genuinely scared her sometimes. Every day my mom and I think about the huge bullet I had dodged for not continuing to string him along.\n\nTl;Dr escaped a relationship I wasn't feeling and avoided my ex trying to convert me.",

The person I was working with (I'll call them Q) had this house in a very upscale neighborhood that was like a mcmansion and a full unfinished basement where I would be in charge of setting up probably the largest grow op I've ever ran, but supposedly this was all legal when talking about it with Q. I got through a couple of harvests when one day, we were down in the basement and the door rings and Q is visibly worried and asks me to go check it.\n\nMe being under the impression this was all legal, I had no problems and answered the door to two detectives who were looking to talk with the owner of the house, Q. I told them I would see if he was in and went to get him but he just ignored them until they left. At this time, there was also talks between Q and I that this was going so well, that they would be putting the house in my name (covering the upkeep costs) and have me move in their full time to live AND buy me a brand new luxury car because my shitbox of a ride wasn't good enough to be in the neighborhood which to a young adult in a supposedly legal job, that did sound like a nice bonus.\n\nWell after the visit from the nice detectives and seeing how my boss reacted, I knew something wasn't right and decided it was best to get outta that position before something bad happened. I ended up telling Q I just wasn't seeing the same vision as them or something and wished them well and that was that.... until, not even a week after I left, police raided the house and it was all over the news. \n\nSmart thinking and not getting caught up in the bonuses saved me from apparently a lot of fines, charges on my record and probably some jail time because I'm pretty sure we had more plants than we were supposed to and probably violated some housing codes so they could get the juice they needed to run everything without tripping a normal breaker.

But the Full Moon Party was happening on Koh Phangan on the other side of Thailand on Boxing Day and we were psyched about it. So we left. Took the boat to Phuket, then a bus up the coast which dropped a bunch of Swedish tourists off at Khaolak before stopping in Ranong and renewing our month long Thai Visas across the border in Burma, then a bus back to Bangkok. We got back to Koh Phangan on Christmas Day. Woke up on Boxing Day super excited and walked down the beach to get breakfast. The BBC was playing footage of this waterlogged waste land. At first we thought it was obvious somewhere else in the world but everybody was crowding around each bars tv. It was then we realised we had just dodged the biggest natural disaster in living memory. Koh Phi Phi had been almost completely destroyed. Maya Bay nailed. The poor park rangers there swept away. We tried to volunteer but the Thais wouldn’t let anyone back there as the military were running the show in the zone. We later met survivors. One couple was having breakfast, looked up and saw the whole street coming towards the restaurant. Everybody was crushed against the wall at the back of the restaurant and the guy managed to grab onto a spiral staircase and drag his wife up, most of the other diners were crushed to death against the wall. Their friend was sucked down a stormwater drain in the centre of the island. Went through the drain system and was spat 3 kilometres out to sea and survived. Picked up a by a dive boat in a debris field  it he middle of the fucking ocean. The whole period was surreal being there. Phi Phi actually got two waves because it’s angled north to south, to headbands with a thin isthmus in the middle, shaped like a bone. Wave came up and split around the southern headland, so came in both sides of the thin strip and met in the middle crushing and sandwiching everything it encountered and then sucking it all back out to sea. We also learned that all the tourists died at Khaolak except for I think about 6 people.",

I noticed lots of people marching in the streets going to a protest in a square as I was walking back to my hotel. I didn't think much about it since protesting is common in the EU, especially around late 2019 right before Brexit. Back at the hotel other guests coming back said there was a riot going on and others were making plans at the front desk to cut their stay short or leave with luggage in hand. The area I had been walking through about an hour was now filled with police and rioters fighting eachother, molotav cocktails being thrown, cars and trash set on fire... As the night progressed I could hear the chaos from my hotel room with the windows closed.\n\nMade it to the airport the next morning. National guards(?) were randomly checking peoples ID/ passports at the gate and pulling them into interogation rooms since some rioters were supposedly leaving the country and the night before the airport was shutdown by a large group of them. Many missed their flights due to this. I made it onto my flight shaken up by what was going on, worrying if the country would destablize and just wanting to takeoff asap. Caught one of the last flights out since shortly after we took off yet another group somehow made it on the tarmac with intentions to disrupt transportation and shut the airport down again. Which I later learned after landing back in NYC. Never experienced anything like that as an American (before Jan 6th anyway) and it made me not want to visit Barcelona again.",

I got to talking to the head teacher of the nursing department. It’s important to mention that this college operated way differently than most as there was only one teacher per department which is possible because of how small the school is. Anyways, the teacher was SUPER nice and helpful and I thought at that moment I would decide to go there. Flash forward a month later and I’m going down to the college to conduct an interview with the head of admissions. Although I was already accepted, I was meeting with the head of admissions to confirm my acceptance and to fill out paperwork. I decided to swing by the health and safety building again to tell the teacher that I’ll be seeing him a lot more  and that I’m excited to start studying under him. This is when it gets interesting:\n\nThe teacher left his job because he got an amazing job offer at another university. I got to talking to the new teacher and THE FIRST thing he says to me is “did you know the moon landing, covid, and all STDs are fake?” I laughed because I thought “this guys the head of nursing at a university. Surely he’s joking”. He then told me to “shut the hell up” and went on this 20 minute rant about masks, the government, and how his wife left him. I don’t mind people having personal beliefs. You can’t believe in whatever you want but as long as your a good person, your good in my book however; this guy just came across rude and demeaning. It totally turned me off from the university. I ended up going into the admissions office and filed a formal complaint against the teacher. I left and now attend a WAY better university.\n\nIf I didn’t swing by that building, I would’ve been in a WAY different scenario.",

She was a part of a 12 piece funk band and we wanted them to perform at the wedding (they did). The only issue was that the wedding venue didn't have the power for all the amps and the like. Luckily for me, I had an electrician cousin. So we cleared the plan with the venue: my cousin would come in and temp wire from the panel (assuming it could handle it - it could), run the wire to the stage, and then take it all down before we left at the end of the night.\n\nWell, he wired it up 2 days before the wedding and he calls me:\n\n\"Cuz, that place is a mess.

All but $500 of the repairs will be covered under the warranty. And when I say just a hair under the warranty, I mean, like, 100 miles. We drive a lot because we live in a rural area. If we'd procrastinated even just a few days on going to get the extra key for the car, we would have had to pay the entire repair amount out of pocket.",

I reached the crest of a slight hill, revealing a white sedan that flew by me (very fast) going the wrong way on the highway (toward me) in the other (passing) lane.  Took me a few seconds to even register what happened.  If I hadn't been in the travel lane, it would have absolutely been a head-on in the middle of freekin' nowhere, I'm certain everyone involved would have either been dead or died out there before any help could arrive.",

No other cars around for several hundred yards in either direction, except the guy right on my rear.

            "text": "I was offered a new job with greater pay + benefits but almost turned it down out of pity & guilt. \n\nI worked for a doctor who was kind, but maybe \"too kind\". He hired a new manager after his previous manager was caught having stolen thousands from his practice. (That's another story for another post).\n\nThis new manager clearly lied on her resume & frequently got on everyone's nerves with her incompetence & clear lack of experience. While everyone talked shit about her behind her back, I was the only one who didn't have a problem responding to her honestly when I thought she was being unreasonable. (She did not like this,or me).\n\nThe doctor also had a medical assistant who had been with him for ten years. I did not get along with her for two reasons: 1. She was moody & rude to our coworkers and the patients. 2. She would lie to patients about being busy and would make them wait for things they needed longer than necessary, just because. Patients then would complain with their worries to me, and I had to make excuses for her not wanting to help them in that moment. \n\nStill, we never fought, as I always choose to \"kill with kindness\". I didn't go out of my way to be nice to her, but I was respectful, and occasionally would make a joke with her if I saw she was in a good mood. I always just preferred to keep the peace, so we can work in peace. \n\nOne day, the doctor got really sick and was in critical condition. By this time, I was pretty unhappy at work because I was tired of walking on eggshells around the medical assistant & I was tired of the new manager, who seemed to now \"have it out for me\". (She started assigning me trivial tasks that weren't meant for me, backing me up on my actual, important, assigned tasks).\n\nI called the agent that found me this employment & asked her to browse for new job opportunities. She quickly found me a great opportunity working in a high profile bank that would provide me way better pay & benefits, & was located on the 58th floor of a building with a spectacular view of NYC. \n\nInitially, I was scared. I didn't expect the opportunity to present itself so soon, & I was pressured to make decisions quickly due to competition. I mostly felt bad for leaving while the doctor was sick, and I didn't even know how to break the news to him. When I did, I cried & we hugged. He wished me only the best and offered letters of recommendation if I ever needed them. He also got me into what is now my favorite show of all time- Bojack Horseman. \n\nI ended up doing what was best for me & handed in my two weeks notice. The manager took it & said \"thank you\" with a smile. \n\nI later found out from another coworker that the medical assistant and the manager had plotted & intented to fire me, but my leaving saved them the effort (& me the anger/embarrassment).\n\nI also found out that two weeks after I left, the manager was fired because the doctor and his staff could no longer tolerate her incompetence. \n\nMoral of the story, when it comes to jobs, ALWAYS put yourself first.",

The car I was driving was a Camero sports car.  It handled great and had a low center of gravity.  There was a huge ravine with a ~20ft drop on the left side of the road.  Both sides of the road had mature trees.  A 2 (1 lane each way) lane rural state high, with no median.\n\nAnyway we were running about 55-60 mph and I had a few car lengths behind him.  Didnt notice the wood strapped to the roof, since I was too low.  All of a sudden his straps broke loose and the wind whipped the wood up in the air.  I hit my brakes but knew it was going to hit my windshield and more than likely come through the windshield.\n\nI served right on to the shoulder to avoid the wood which was about windshield level when I went by.  Couldnt go left because of on coming traffic.  Right a head about was a steel guard rail.  I swerved back left to avoid the guard rail.  At this time the ass end of the car hit gravel and broke loose, which kicked right and through the nose of the car into on coming traffic.  \n\nI missed the back end of a car coming from the opposite way by about 6\".  Meanwhile, I'm trying to get control back and keep from going over the ravine on the over the left side of the road, by steering right, to get back to my original lane.  At this time a truck blows by me in the right lane.   He was tailgating me, and ran right over the lumber that was now laying in the road.  He never stopped.  \n\nSo at that point, I'm trying to get the car back under control, when he blows by me, it startled me, and I jerked the wheel harder than I meant, and at this point the back end of my car passes the front end, and I am rolling down the on coming traffic lane, backwards about 30 mph.  But the car is under control.  Then I look in my rear view mirror and see a semi getting closer and closer very fast.  So I floor it and and get moving, and turn into an open driveway about 30 feet away and stop.\n\nThe whole thing felt like it lasted a few minutes, but it was over in under 10 seconds.  I stopped and got of the car, legs jelly at this time.  1 person who saw it happen asked if I was ok, pulled the lumber out of the road and left.  I stood there for about 10 minutes wondering if what had just happened was real.  The truck that lost the lumber never stopped.\n\nCar's transmission went out a week later.  And a year ago I see photos from an accident where a piece of plywood is sticking out of the windshield of the car.  The driver was killed.  Any other vehicle with a higher center of gravity I'm sure would have rolled over.\n\nTLDR, some guy with improperly secured lumber almost decapitated me, nearly cause a 4 car accident, then doesn't stop.

Hernia doc said yep its a hernia we're in a pandemic we can schedule you for whenever if you want to wait a bit there shouldn't be any problems no hurry. I decided to get it out of the way they had a cancelation so I scheduled for a week later. I wake up from surgery and the Doc says there was a complication they didn't get to the Hernia when they were going in they noticed my appendix was about to explode so they took that out instead (still not the tactical nuke). I asked about when they could fix the hernia he said the appendix looked funny and was going to send it to the lab and get back to me. The lab was really backed up from the pandemic so several weeks later I get a call from the doc. It was a really rare appendix cancer something that happens to around 1000 Americans a year, not only that but of the 2 kinds of appendix cancer based on lab work I had the worst of the 2, the kind that spreads everywhere really fast and cuts your lifespan down considerably even with treatment. The 1st kind grows slow and stays put but every once in awhile it will go into overdrive differentiates, pokes out of the abdominal wall and spits cancer slime everywhere that turns whatever it touches into more cancer. The cut off for it turning from good into the bad kind is 1 cm tumor, mine as 1.5 cm, under the microscope it had differentiated and they saw the cells that spit cancer slime had formed. There's really only one treatment referred to as the mother of all surgeries which is it's own ball of tactical nukes. I stew over that for a few weeks till they can get more tests scheduled (still in pandemic so it takes awhile). Go in for a barrage of scans, poking's and prodding's and the scans are all clean no signs of cancer spread (mostly). It had just turned from the slow growing kind that stays put into the fast moving kind and hadn't had a chance to spit cancer slime outside the wall holding my appendix if I had waited just a week for the hernia surgery, literally everyday that I waited  would have exponentially increased the odds of it spreading the mucin. They think they got it all when they took the appendix out. There's a few things they want to keep an eye on that they're reasonably sure is just scaring from the surgery but they gave me an 80% chance of being cancer free. I have more scans in December to make sure.\n\n\nUpdate Dec.30: My scans in December came back great. The thing they were keeping an eye on got smaller not bigger which is what they would expect if it was scar tissue from the surgery and not a tumor. Although not completely out of the woods (they're still going to do routine scans for the next 5-6 years) pretty much every scan is expected to improve my odds. I get to do the hernia surgery in 3 months, my oncologist will be there to take a look in case the surgeon see's anything weird while he's in there",

Then headed inland to the elephants and tea plantations.

All the places I had visited 3 days ago, gone. My drivers house, car, everything, gone. I travel with a hand-held world radio so once I fished that out of my bag, we found an English news station and that's when it got real.

My college was the victim of a school shooter.\n\nBack when I was enrolled, I had an hour gap between my english class and my math class, and the english building was only a few yards away from one of the school’s parking lots, so I would wait it out in my car. Almost every day, I would take a nap an then study, or maybe watch a show on my phone (Usually the latter, but I tried to do the former lol). It was actually pretty nice. But on this day, for no real reason, I decided to go home and eat something instead. No bad feeling in my stomach, no voice in the back in my head, nothing like that. I was just hungrier then usual, so I went home. I wasn’t paying much attention to my phone after I got home, but in the span 15-20 minutes, I had missed some 30+ phone calls/text messages from family and friends, and even ex girlfriends. And because I didn’t answer, they all thought I was dead. It was surreal calling each of them back and hearing the same thing over and over again from so many different people, and in so many different ways.\n\nTurns out, the shooter had started in the classroom right next to the one I had just left, and only minutes after the class had began. After he moved on from the classroom, he went around the perimeter of the building and shot indiscriminately at whoever he saw, right up until the police showed up and he killed himself.\n\nHe killed 9 people, 8 of them from the classroom, and injured over a dozen more. 3 of the 9 were in my graduating class, and all of it would have been only a few yards away from where I would have been parked.\n\nSometimes I’ll still wonder if I had walked past the shooter on the way back to my car without even realizing it. Or maybe if I had my windows down on the drive out of campus, if I would have heard the gunshots. Obviously, I’ve thought about what might have happened if I had just followed my normal routine instead of going home, but if I’m honest, that’s the one I try to not entertain very often. I think, most likely, I would have been fine. I was already in my car. But I also would have been sleeping, had a very literal front row seat of it all, and the shooter wasn’t being picky about his target.\n\nIn the end, I’ll never know.",

I didn’t want him to spend the money, but he was dead set on it since he travels for work and he gets nervous about home security when he’s away.  \n\nAbout a week later my husband is out of town and everything seems normal.  Then a neighbour mentions that someone scraped her car and asks me if I saw anything.  I tell her about my ring camera and offer to check the video with her.  \n\nSo I pull out my phone and we start going through motion alerts.  We didn’t find out what happened to her car, but there was a video of two guys on my front porch at 3:30 am.  They were holding a heavy looking duffel bag while staring at the ring doorbell.  One of them looked at his phone and said “Oh shit it’s a camera” before the other one said “We should leave.”\n\nThis all took place on the first night of my husband’s work trip.  We usually have two cars in the driveway, but that night it was just mine.  Pretty sure they had planned a home invasion knowing that my husband was out of town.  \n\nI bought four more cameras.\n\nAdding: I reported it to the police because I assumed that the guys hit other houses in the area.  The police said they didn’t need a copy of the video, but would get in touch if there were any break-ins.  So I think my house was targeted.",

That date was March 13th, 2020, the last day both the school and the library were open for that school year due to COVID. Since the library was closed, the job offer fell through (the library opened again but had limited hours and no longer had the available position). Once this news hit, I immediately emailed the assistant principal and rescinded my two week's notice, telling him that the second job was no longer happening.\n\nWhile school was closed and eventually switched to virtual, it was really unclear what would happen to the subs. It was eventually decided that the perm subs would continue to get paid throughout the school closure as long as we attended meetings a few times a week, while the per diem subs were out of work.

We'd usually get the bus back to his and crash there. In the daytime the bus went to the nearby shopping centre and that was a couple of stops before his house, but at night it went a different route because the shopping centre was closed, and we'd have to get off on this unlit back road, walk through a tunnel which leads to a field behind the housing estate, walk beside that and then get to his house. All of this unlit. \n\nSo, this particular night, we're on the bus and it's about 2/3am, my friend had fallen asleep and I was trying to keep an eye out for our stop coming up. It's pitch black and I'm struggling since I'm not used to the night route. Eventually I wake him up and he realises we've missed our stop but we would get off at a different stop further along, it was just a longer walk from a different direction. Fine. We do that and eventually get to his and crash. \n\nThat same night, a young pregnant teenager was mugged when walking through the tunnel  next to the stop we were meant to get off at. She was mugged for her mobile phone, stabbed and left to die. CCTV showed her walking in around midnight I think, and not coming back out. Her body wasn't discovered til around 7am. As we were on the bus at 3am we absolutely would have been the ones to find her had we not missed our stop. \n\nSo to my first point, I do wonder had we found her, could she maybe have still been alive at that point and could we have been able to get an ambulance to save her. But I also know if she was already dead/dying it will have been harrowing and traumatic and probably impacted me a lot.  This was about 15 years ago and I still think about her.",

That is, what I thought was the correct breaker. Because all the lights are now off, I couldn't properly tell. Get back on the ladder, remove the ballast cover, then twist off the wire connectors over neutral and hot. They are now sort of dangling in the air.\n\nSince those two wires are in the way of the ground wire, which is screwed onto the back of the fixture, I move my hand in to bend them back. For the purpose of leverage I grab the insulated portion of the hot wire instead of the exposed part, and this action jostles the exposed parts of the hot and neutral wires against each other. But who cares, since the circuit breaker is off? Nope. I see a huge spark, and hear the circuit breaker flip.\n\nBut for the random orientation of a couple of wires and my fingers, I would have eaten 120v fifteen feet in the air standing on a ladder; death would have been extremely likely, and perhaps even preferable to the non-death outcomes (various types of paralysis, brain damage, and severe burns).",

It was the same tour, the same helicopter, the same pilot (I believe) as what we were in not even two weeks prior. \n\n\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/us/5-killed-including-2-newlyweds-in-helicopter-crash-in-hawaii.amp",

The trip plans were already in motion, but I hadn't dated anyone in a while, we got along extraordinarily well, and I figured sometimes you have to take chances. So I explained everything to her and let her decide if it was worth it. She said yes, and we started dating about a year later.\n\nEverything *seemed* great until I left, and she completely changed tunes. She went from warm, sweet, caring, and supportive to manipulative, evasive, erratic, and mean. She demanded that I come home then and there, everything was my fault, and I needed to fix things. We'd known each other for a while at this point, were very close, and I had never seen this from her before. Hell, we had *planned extensively* so that my trip would be a healthy separation for both of us. So instead of thinking, \"This is bad, just bail.\" (Which would've been better) I tried to fix things. After throwing her weight around for several weeks and me trying to stand my ground, be understanding, and figure out what the hell was going on, she dumped me.\n\nNot long after, I was contacted by mutual friends. Ours wasn't the only bridge she had burned. She had done something similar to several of our friends. Then, they showed me a Facebook post where she admitted to having 5-6 untreated mental disorders, which she had learned to hide throughout her life. Several of these disorders are known to cause people to behave manipulatively when they feel insecure, and she fit the same profile. Not long after, COVID hit. I was \"lucky\"; when the worst of her harassment and bullying started, I was thousands of miles away, and she couldn't get to me.",

A parent dying flips your life upside down and you have to deal with the gut wrenching feeling that your life will never be the same. My parents were divorced, so my mom became our sole caregiver.\n\nFortunately, my dad was smart and insured that his life insurance policy would go towards myself and my brother for college, (we also received gracious donations of money from family and friends of the family). \n\nAs I grew older and could understand, my mom began to tell me more as to why my parents divorced, how he had been verbally, (and on occasion) physically abusive. Soon hearing those stories I started to put two and two together and realized that a lot of the things my father would do with my brother and I were pretty manipulative and abusive to kids. Telling us things we as children should never hear about (war, how our mom didn’t love us, how he still loved our mom but what she did was unforgivable, etc) basically trying to drill it into us that our mom was at fault for the situation he was in. A lot of the stories he’d tell us would pose him in a good light, while my mom just happened to have a completely different experience, cuz obviously dad was an abusive narcissist.\n\non the day he died, he was complaining about how other people around him weren’t speaking English and how “this is America, speak the language”. He was part of that crowd. So it may be safe to assume he may not have fully approved of the man I’m currently with. \n\nThe most fucked up part is if he had not died, I more than likely wouldn’t have been able to afford the 4 year college experience that I did, I wouldn’t have the degree I do, wouldn’t have been able to move out of state in prospects of a better life, wouldn’t have been able to travel abroad to another country for schooling, bought a car, or put a down payment on a house. Had my dad not died, my life would be completely different and that’s absolutely terrifying. The phrase “everything happens for a reason” holds so much weight to me since it’s literally the epitome of my life. Though he was far from perfect, I can’t help but feel at least some sense of immense gratitude for the situation I’m in, even if that meant I did lose a parent\n\nTL:DL Abusive dad died, had he not died my life would be a 180 and more than likely shitty and a financial struggle",

And I've posted this on r/creepyencounters before using a different throwaway I've since forgotten the password for, if it sounds familiar. \n\nAround the time I turned 30 (2010), I lost a large amount of weight. While I'd previously always looked my age or older, I suddenly looked to be about 5 - 10 years younger than I actually was. I started hanging out in Allston, an area of Boston known for its nightlife, often with people in their early-to-mid twenties.\n\nThere was a guy who also hung out down there who who really stood out. I never saw him in the bars, just walking down Brighton Ave. or North Beacon Street, usually carrying a gym bag, always alone. Unlike most understated Bostonians, he dressed in a very \"eurotrash\" sort of way. He had a light olive complexion with smooth skin and dark hair, which he wore slicked back.\n\nWhat I remember most vividly is that every time I saw him he was wearing reflective aviator sunglasses, so I never got a look at his eyes.\n\nI thought of him as \"Aviator Dude.\" Enjoying my new confidence, I decided to try to befriend Aviator Dude. \n\nThe first few times I tried to make eye contact, I got exactly zero response. No acknowledgement whatsoever. I suspected he was unfriendly and not interested, but maybe he just didn't see me. I wasn't done trying yet.\n\nFinally, one day in early autumn 2010, Aviator Dude and I stood across the street from each other, waiting for a light to change so we could each cross. I decided that this was my chance.\n\nAs the light changed to the \"walk\" signal, I made direct eye contact with him. I gave him a flirty smile... and then I winked at him.\n\nI immediately regretted this decision.\n\nAviator Dude stopped dead in his tracks. His jaw dropped a little bit, then his lips hardened into a sneer. I didn't need to see past the aviators to know that his face had twisted with disgust.\n\nMore than a bit taken aback, I kept walking past him. I looked back at him briefly. Aviator Dude was still standing there, in the middle of the intersection of North Beacon and Cambridge streets, staring at me with a disgusted look on his face. He shook his head, rang his hands, and walked on, muttering under his breath.\n\n*Well, okay, then.*\n\nAbout five years later, I saw Aviator Dude again, but not in person. In 2015, I was watching the trial of the Boston Marathon Bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, online via Twitter and the news updated in real time. Some of the evidence presented included photographs of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older brother who was killed in a shootout with police.\n\n I immediately recognized him - Tamerlan Tsarnaev was Aviator Dude. Not only was he a radicalized murderer responsible for the worst terrorist attack in Massachusetts history, one of the points brought up repeatedly by the surviving marathon bombing suspect's defense lawyers was that Tamerlan was abusive to those weaker than him, including and especially the women in his life. A domestic violence charge regarding an ex-girlfriend held up his US citizenship application, and his widow's college friends testified that they heard him getting verbally abusive and throwing furniture at her. It has been speculated that the man may also have been responsible for a triple homicide in suburban Waltham in September of 2011- about a year after the events described above.\n\nI'm really glad he rejected me.",

She had told him years ago she liked him and he kindly let her down hut told her he didn't feel the same. Move four years later and I met my bf and we started flirting. The ex friend decided she needed to be there everytime we spoke, getting between us, telling my bf how great they were together so on and so on. I said I wasn't super political, what does she do? Get wildly political and even try and call me a nazi and the things I like nazi based. We played dnd with a different group then normal and she yelled at me for wanting to fire a fireball into a small room before initiative started and decided I was still going too once the fight started, of course I wasn't. This lasted like ten minutes and these other people yelled at her to stop yelling at me and I obviously wasn't going to throw a fireball anymore. She took this out on them for months for \"siding with me\", including someone who was having issues. Double for them. When it was apparent that we gad started dating, things got worse and worse, we had to hire people just to deal with her just for the discord server. And when we did, she used her autism as a weapon. She was trying to egg me on to fight with her, call her a name, something to tell my bf I was bullying her. This lasted 2 years. She finally fucked up and acted this was in front of two of my bf's other friends who had been through abuse. They saw all the signs, coincidentally loosing her wallet, \"accidentally\" knocking into people or loosing things. She even yanked my hair and kicked someone else because we got along. We all sat down and talked to my bf. He was crushed to hear her do so much and even other people tell him stories off her. She lost closed to 20 people in a matter of days. I hadn't even known that she had been mooching off an entire group of people I haven't met yet. My boyfriend wanted so hard to believe she was good, that she could change, that she would accept his feelings for me. He's sweet and kind and that's part of the reason I love him. And I don't blame him for not wanting to choose between a friend and his girlfriend, I sure never wanted to be the girlfriend that makes my partner choose. Don't get me wrong. I AM happy to have that bitch gone. And apparently she pushed multiple potential partners out of my bf's life before me.

            "text": "I dodged three nukes with one bad decision that saved my life, my sanity and my future.\n\nIn the 90s, I had my heart broken by an ex I had rescued from a bad relationship and moved back to my hometown with. After my stint in the USN, she had started contacting my grandmother. I had little money but a decent job and an apartment. I left the job to help her.\n\nShe was being terrorized by a guy she had met after we were separated by me being taken by CPS and moved away from an abusive family. She contacted my grandma to ask for my help. Grandma was the only person in the family that I spoke to. I called her and agreed to help her get her things back. \n\nWe ended up together for 6 months before she called it off after reconnecting with her trashy hometown friends and hooking up with a guy at the E-club in San Diego. I tried to contact her a few times. She told me I was a stalker, then swore I had broken into her car. I had not.\n\nShe made it impossible for me to keep my new job by calling and complaining about me to my boss, so I gave away all my non-portable possessions and took a job selling magazines all over the USA. I was waiting for my GI Bill and financial aid to start school, but why sit there and wait a whole year? This was a bad decision, but it saved my ass.\n\nThe reasons for this decision being bad was the crew life. We went from city to city, state to state, selling subscriptions in parking lots and door-to-door. It sucked but I was good at it and had some fine adventures. Everyone else seemed to be into meth or cocaine or heroin, except for two kids from Oklahoma who I instantly got along with. I kept copies of every subscription I sold, which included the addresses and names of the people involved. This quirk (and my habit of keeping every piece of paper for years) would later save my freedom and my future.\n\nThe first nuke I dodged came in Wisconsin. Sometimes crews would send a team with a car handler to a separate location (a \"spur\"). I did not get along with the car handler who would lead the spur. I told him I didn't want to head out with his spur, and he said, \"Get on or get beat.\"\n\nI had been on the road for almost 7 months by this time and never gotten into any scraps. I just didn't feel like half the shit they argued and fought over was worth it. But this was, and I wasn't going to head out with a hard-drinking idiot who drove like a maniac in the best of times.\n\nShort version of the dodged nuke: The car handler tried to beat me up and got a busted nose, a raccoon mask and a sore set of balls for his trouble. The POS tweaker who usually helped him \"assert authority\" in the past did not wish to join in. Three days later, the crew manager picked me up outside the Harley factory (after a rad day selling to assembly line workers) and said, \"Well, they're gone, and I wanted you to know before you turn on the TV.\" \n\nThe car handler, drunk in Minnesota, had rolled a van with 10 other young adults inside, killing them all. Two of them were close friends, and the rest were just lost souls that liked things I did not (mostly drugs).\n\nThe crew manager, who was in some ways a decent guy, couldn't handle the guilt and offered to get us hired on with other crews. He was done with the business. But it was time for me to go home and start school in a month, so he paid me out, thanked me, and drove me halfway to CA (to TX) and got me a plane ticket home. Along the way, we hit a lot of strip clubs, bars and pretty amazing restaurants he had discovered near hotels over his years in the business. We became good friends on that last road trip.\n\nBack home, I had just settled into an apartment and called a friend to say I was in town and wanted to go buy some furniture. I didn't know that the whole time, before I returned, my ex had convinced everyone I was stalking her, harassing her husband-to-be/E-club sleazy hookup. While I was gone, she had filed for protective orders (which they never served and were thus dismissed), and had regularly filed police complaints about new \"incidents\".\n\nShe told the Sheriffs who were trying to serve and find me that I was, \"hiding out and selling drugs to get by\". Within an hour of that call to a friend, who truly thought I had gone rogue and underground, and was terrorizing my ex, my door got kicked in and I was arrested. I had no idea what for. What I did have was receipts; 7 months of them, all over the USA, from WA to NC to Michigan. What the police had was 5 reports, one every month and a half, of me assaulting, menacing, calling or burgling her. I was shocked, but I was innocent and knew it.\n\nI kept my mouth shut and demanded a lawyer. My Public Defender tried to sell me a deal, which I was not having one bit of. She demanded I explain how I would defend myself and I mentioned my magazine sales receipts and gave her my crew manager's home phone number. Two days later, the charges were dismissed. After that hearing, her squid guy served me with her fresh DVRO. 10 days later, the fresh attempt at a DVRO was dismissed with prejudice when I showed up to the the hearing with receipts and a written and Fedex'd letter from my former boss and now loyal amigo. Nuke dodged.\n\nShe left state with her POS sailor, who had finished his enlistment. They apparently had a rocky relationship after the first kids were born. She cheated on him often and he has hung in there. I have seen pictures of their kids (we still have childhood friends in common and people always want to know about that time in my life). She looks haggard, too.\n\nTwo of her kids look like a guy she cheated with from MySpace, something I was made aware of by one of the same trashy friends (who is friends with one of my sisters) who took her to the E-club and now gleefully spreads news of her shitty existence. She has filed multiple restraining orders against her cheat-exes and a couple against her husband, is diagnosed as having a BPD and suffering from manic depression.\n\nThe Nuke I dodged there was that I loved her, and I might have even taken her back after she cheated. She contacted me on FaceBook, and I immediately quit the app completely when I started feeling sentimental. Holy crap. No, lady!\n\nEdit: Minor punctuation fix.",

Fell backwards off the raised platform which was at least 12 feet off the very sharp and pointy rock ground. As I was tumbling over I somehow saw a chain in which I instinctively grabbed which spun me around enough so that I wouldn't land on the ground on my head/neck and more my butt/lower back. I still suffer a bit of back issues but I have been in car accidents and have had other injuries so not sure how much it played a part. If I didn't grab that chain I probably wouldn't be here right now. At the time I didn't think much of it but thinking about it now makes me realize how close I came to death. \n\nAs a side note as I am laying on the ground, shell shocked, one of the workers yells down if I am alive. After catching my breath I said yes and the asshole says to get back up and get back to work. He was the one guy actually from Alberta on the crew, the rest were Maritimers and this one statement is basically all you need to know about the majority of the people from Alberta.

My father was a paramedic for many years of his life so he told us that he wasn’t exhibiting any of the conventional signs of a heart attack (heart attack pains aren’t positional but his was, it was full chest not just the left side, taking some Tums helped it get better, etc.) so that he didn’t need to go.   \n\nFinally after me and my brother essentially yelling at him for a couple hours to get checked out he finally agreed, only to find out that all of the places he could go to get checked out were already closed for the night (I live about an hour from my metropolitan center and it was a Saturday night). He agreed that he wouldn’t go to work that night and would go to the doctor first thing in the morning and we left it at that.   \n\nNext day, I get a call from my mother crying while I’m out going door to door for a local candidate running for office. She had gone to a party that morning and left my dad home alone to go to the doctor. When he did get up he went to get checked out and was rushed to the hospital for a life-saving procedure. I immediately went back to my dorm, packed up the stuff I’d need to go home as fast as I could, and made the 3 hour drive home.   \n\nWhen I get to the hospital my dad, who’s awake at this point, tells me that what happened was he woke up and, at first, was just going to stay home and TELL US the doctor told him not to eat Italian food at 3 in the morning anymore and that it wasn’t a heart attack, but after a bit of thinking he finally decided that, considering his health and the history of heart disease in the family, me and my brother wouldn’t be happy unless he actually went and showed proof of his visit. Besides, it couldn’t hurt to get checked up and make sure everything under the hood is in good shape.   \n\nSo he went to the doctor’s office, got taken into a room, they did a physical examination and took some blood, he started joking with the nurses (like most dads his age he thinks he’s a comedian), and with that, a doctor walks in and says to him, “You were correct, you weren’t having a heart attack, you were having a massive heart attack.” They immediately threw him in an ambulance, rushed him to the hospital, put two stents in his arteries, and saved his life. What we were told was that he had a 99% blockage but the aspirin in the Tums he had taken the morning prior had opened his arteries up just enough to prevent the pain or any damage, but since it had been just over 24 hours since he’d taken it the aspirin would’ve been wearing off, meaning if he hadn’t gone to the doctor (like he was planning to do) he would’ve had less than a few hours to live.   \n\nThat was pretty much exactly 3 years ago and, to use his own words, he hasn’t felt this healthy since he was about my age. He lost a ton of weight (and has kept most of it off to his credit), took up yoga and does some weightlifting every once in a while, and, most importantly, he’s still alive.   \n\nMy family is extremely close with one another, and I was going through a rough patch in school (so was my brother, who was at a different college on the opposite side of the state, again in his first semester), so I can’t imagine what it would’ve been like if my mom’s phone call that Sunday afternoon was much darker. I’m extremely grateful that I don’t have to worry about that, all because my brother and I pestered him enough to decide to placate us.  \n\nEdit: fixed the spoiler for the tldr at the top",

As we were walking there, there was a guy on a bike standing in front of a house, he tried to make conversation as we were passing, “Hey what’s up guys, you guys going to the bar?”  He tried to give us a pound (handshake) and I’m like whatever dude, he’s probably drunk.  \n\nSuddenly, the door where we were standing in front of opens and a man with a revolver steps out, he fires the first shot at the guy on the bike, misses, then fires another 2 shots as the guy on the bike starts to pedal off, the fourth shot went right by my right ear (I heard it pass) and hit the siding of a house, the fifths shot went between me and my friend (on my left) and by the last shot I had my back turned, heading to the bar door.\n\nMy buddy completely froze in place, didn’t move in complete shock, I had never seen anyone freeze before, he was staring at the guy firing shots and didn’t even flinch.  “YO!” I call to him from the bar door, “What the fuck are you doing, get inside.”  I tell him also in shock, the shooter goes back into his house, the bartender is asking us what happened and if we’re all right.  My friend was still in shock “What happened, was that real?  Did that just happen?”  He was freaking out , the cops came and got statements from us, they though we were involved and I had to take them to my bakery to show them I wasn’t lying.\n\nThey arrested the dude at his house shortly after, so apparently what had happened was the dude on the bike had problems with the shooter in the house, he tried to engage us in conversation to make it seem like he was with more people, the guy inside the house sees three dudes out front, opens fire.  \n\n6 shots between 3 people and he didn’t hit any of us, the crazy thing is, this happened in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania, I’m a city boy I expect that shit out there, I moved to Jim Thorpe to get away from it after some dude with a gun broke into my house, but that’s a whole other story…",

They didn't see it and left. I was in a holding cell so i took the bag and flushed it down the toilet. Knowing how close i was to altering my whole life in that moment made scared straight.

I went to work and told my boss of my predicament and he was very understanding but he laid real world truths on me that day.\nHe told me that the reason the carpenter had fired everyone was because he wasn’t paying them, and he probably needed me to start immediately because ‘he was swimming up shit creek with a toilet seat’.\nI stayed with the company and became acquainted with all the trades people in our area.

Due to a lot of revising and studying I lost track of time and had to sleep. Since I take the metro to go to school I had to wake up a lot earlier than usual to catch the bus to make it to the train station on time. The class started at 7am but due to exam days it starts at 8am so I had to be at the station at 7am. The previous night after studying I had forgotten to set my alarm that I woke up at 8:45am. At first I was angry and in a rush to get out. I was so focused on time that I didn’t pay attention to the news choppers(I live in a crime populated area so it’s no surprise) on the direction of where the train station I take was. When I get to the station I learned there was a shootout at 7am that killed 5 people and left 13 injured. Made it to my class taking another route, luckily the Professor was kind enough to allow me to take the exam even though I was almost 3 hours late. I passed and I didn’t tell him about the incident but it has left me wondering, what if I did wake up on time and made it to that station. \n2. This happened during middle school. I was on my way to school and I always had to take the morning buses to get there on time which usually meant that I had to wake up earlier than the usual lot of students. This particular morning went by fast and I didn’t catch the bus I usually took to get to school. The next bus came 45 minutes later and I found out the bus I missed had gotten into an accident with a semi truck that left the bus turned on it’s side. Luckily there were no deaths, only injuries but the incident is still a mind blowing case.",

He said he was trying to see if I'd \"make a good gf or not.\" And then he got really angry at me when I was just \"nope nope nope worst gf ever, I cheat and I'm a clinger and I'm just so messy, terrible gf.\" I was not subtle at all, but I was really creeped out because we were on the top floor of our building on a wing that only had us living there at the time. He was in my room. He was four times my size. I was genuinely afraid.   \n\n\nBut he left. A few months later, he started spreading rumours about what a slut I was, saying I'd thrown myself at him but he rejected me because I was such a diseased slut. Come to find out a bit later that another girl had moved onto our floor and he pulled the same shit, except he forced himself on her and gave her HPV. A bit after that, he started dating this raging bitch on campus who just fueled all his rumors, telling everyone that his victim literally took payment for sex. The bullying got so bad that this girl tried to commit suicide and had to leave the program. I developed an eating disorder (in a fucking cooking school) and had to take 3 months off for rehab. When I got back, he and the raging bitch had broken up. She went to the hospital over some super vague story about falling down some stairs or some other cliche that domestic abuse victims use, before she dropped out.   \n\n\nI moved off campus around then so I didn't really socialize with my schoolmates outside of class, and I switched to night courses so most of my classmates were other working adults that didn't get involved in the dorm bullshit.

I had a crush on one of them.  One Wednesday our school was playing hockey against their school. I remember it was Wednesday because it was trash day and a day I'll never forget.   \n\nMy sister, who had a \"new to her\" used car and had her license only a few months, drove everywhere. She went to the girl's house after school and then came home to pick me up for the game. The two girls were in another car and we were going to follow them.   As I headed to the car, pretty excited to spend some time with this girl I liked, my mom stopped me in the driveway and asked me to take the trash barrels from the curb and put them in the shed behind the house.  My parents were pretty strict then and if you didn't do what you were told, forget it. You would kill any social life you had.  I'm not sure what came over me but they were leaving and I said \"I'll get them later\".  She insisted that I deal with them now and I stood my ground and jumped in the car.  That's when she said, \"You're not going!\".   I begged and pleaded and rushed to get the barrels outback but it was too late.  I had to miss the game and my chance to get to know this girl better.  It turned out it was the last day they were friends and my chance had come and gone.  \n\nA few hours later the police had knocked at the door and informed my mom that my sister was in an accident and needed to get picked up at the hospital.  He couldn't have been more wrong.  It would be months before she would get out.     \n\nWhat had happened was the two drivers were fooling around racing each other and my sister went to pass the other car on a side street.  All of sudden a car was coming from the other direction, she cut in to get back in her own lane, hit the other car, spun out on a patch of ice a the car flew into the woods just off the street.  The car impacted a tree at full speed on the passenger side causing the car to literally wrap around the tree.  There were 18 inches between the front and rear bumper.  There she was leaning against the tree and no passenger seat whatsoever. \n\nShe spent 11 days in a coma and when she came out she has never been the same. She spent several months learning how to walk and even comb her hair.  She's still pretty awesome today but I lost the sister I knew that day.  If I had taken the barrels to the shed neither of us would be alive today.",

            "text": "I was at the Boston Marathon in 2013. My sister was running the marathon and I was there to watch, support her, and to run the Boston Marathon 5k which is held the day before. The 5k went well. I walked a lot of it to take in the sights, and crossed the huge finish line, which is the same finish line as the one used for the actual marathon. This part is important.\n\nThe next day, the day of the marathon, my parents are dragging their feet about getting out to the race. I decide to go walk around downtown on my own, waking from the hotel to the race area and enjoying the city of Boston. This is also important.\n\nThe race happens. My parents decide that they want to stay to watch near the end of the race course, around the corner from where the runners make their final sprint on Boylston Street. I decide to walk down further because I didn't much like that area. I walked all the way until there was a bridge and decided that I'd be able to call or message my parents when I saw my sister running through and so they'd be prepared to cheer for her. This worked well. She finished the race in about three hours.\n\nAfter she was finished, it was time to go meet up with her. I told my parents to meet me at the finish line, but, because I had crossed a bridge over the running route, I'd be on the opposite side of the course without any knowledge of how to get across. I told them to wait where they were instead, and I'd meet up with them on Newbury Street. This was the first nuke dodged.\n\nSo, we walked down Newbury. There were port-o-potties here and my dad decided to use them. I thought to use one too, but they were absolutely disgusting, so I chose to wait. The port-o-potties were near the finish line. I had the thought to walk over towards the sides of the end of the course to take a picture of the finish line arch for Instagram. But I thought, nah, I'm tired. It's been hours. I just want to meet up with my sister. Besides, I'd already seen the finish line the day before.\n\nSo, my dad finishes up, and we keep walking down Newbury Street. And that's when we hear them. The bombings. The decision I made to not take that finish line photo was my nuke dodged (or, in this case, bomb). The rest of that day was wild, and, because I'd walked to the course earlier that day, I was able to lead everyone back to our hotel safely.",

A few of us cut class and took public transit from the Bronx out to Jersey to try to bag shorties for prom, which was coming up soon.  We had a good time but I do not think any of us actually brought any of them to prom. \n\nWe hung out pretty late then headed back to the city to split up and go home to our respective boros. My best friend since we were 8, in the third grade, lived right around the corner so we took the 7 back to Main Street. We must have gotten to the last stop around 11/before midnight because Wendy's was closing soon. I was hungry and wanted to grab something but my homie was tired or didn't wanna go since they were closing up shop and basically said he wanted to go straight home. He persuaded me so we continued on our walk to our respective cribs. \n\nHaving school the next morning,  I woke up to the sound of choppers overhead. Going to take the bus,  I saw mad news helicopters and a large police presence on the streets. It was apparent there was something going on but I was still not sure what.  Later, we found out there had been a massacre in that same Wendy's by 2 guys who had robbed the place.  One of them was previously a worker who I believe may have served me chili and nuggets in the past. Either way, I am extremely glad we never went that night.  Who knows WTF could've happened. \n\nI was best man at his wedding years later.  His wife was one of the girls we'd met that night. \n\n🙏 RIP to all the innocent lives lost that night.

They told us to go see if we could work in the entry level support call center (Mind you - this was before the pandemic so perhaps my outlook would be different now if those same circumstances came up today OR we could do QA work but not like QA scripts and the kind of stuff that developers do. I had been working on a project for almost a year and I spoke up for myself. I said \"Listen, I am really passionate about this. I want to keep working this project. If there is any way you can keep me working on that, it's become a project that I can see having an influence on my career path going forward.\"\n\nBasically, the director of tech (my boss's boss) said, \"We don't know. We don't think so.\" So I setup a meeting with the HR team and told them what happened. The HR rep said \"well, that's not what was meant to happen. They want you to stay in the IT department and do QA on your project. And not like QA scripting and automation or anything. They wanted me to UAT my own product that they were giving to someone else to build. I said \"That isn't what I was told and that's not a good option either. I want a severance package\". They said \"we will see what we can do.\" Essentially, they didn't want to fire my team because they would have to pay unemployment. They were trying to force us to quit. I had worked at this company for 9 years and I was going to be damned if I let them treat me that way. Nope. \n\nThat night, on the way home, I called a friend of mine who worked at a different company. He told me \"we are hiring like crazy. send me your resume.\" So when I got home that evening, I worked on my resume and put together a plan for how to weather the storm if I wasn't able to get hired at the new place. I sent my resume to the hiring manager (happened to be someone I used to work with) and he called me the next morning to setup an interview for that very same day.\n\nMeanwhile, I went back to the office and literally sat at my desk not knowing what to do while I waited for the HR team. I went outside at lunch and took the interview call. They called me 2 hours later to setup a second interview. \n\nThe next day (I think it was a Wednesday) HR team called me into their office and offered me a severance package. I said \"Great, so does this mean I need to give you my 2 weeks notice? They said \"No, if you sign this, your last day is Friday.\" Fuuuuuuck. It's okay. It's okay. I have a plan. I made a plan. So I signed. In all honesty, the shine had worn off anyway and I was ready to move on. They were just opening a door I was too afraid to unlock on my own. Thankfully, I made them give me a real nice coat before they pushed me out. Regardless, I was scared shitless. I had never been unemployed in my adult life. But I had finally come to understand my worth. And I was tired not being valued for it.\n\nI left knowing I was leaving behind some amazing people. I thanked everyone I could and I sent an email \n\n2 days later I did the second interview and also got a phone call from another company who wanted to interview me. A week later, I had offers from both. I took the job at the company where my friend and former colleague worked and negotiated to start 5 weeks later. That was the BEST 5 weeks of my life. I didn't have to worry about money, I didn't have to worry about work. I didn't have to worry about going to an interview.\n\nTurns out, the new job is fantastic. I love what I do and the company I work for. I love what we stand for. I'm the happiest I have ever been in my whole life. I am supported, I am growing and I am sought after for my knowledge. I jumped out of the plane wearing a golden parachute and landed in a much better place.\n\nMeanwhile, since I left, the other company has suffered scandal after scandal and overturned like 3 CEOs since 2018. A lot of people left to work at my current company which I love. \n\nI might have wound up in a much worse position than I am in. I feel so lucky and grateful that I was given the opportunity to feel worthy. To be worthy.\n\nTLDR: Job ended, wound up with a better job a severance package and 5 weeks off.",

JM told me he's going to BH house and there gunna do it all weekend, after that weekend JM told BH that its over between them and he admitted to only using her for sex, a week later the police arrest JM on rape accusations, the police said apparently, he forced himself into her home and raped her for hours. I knew this was a total BS JM is a teenage boy but as with most teenage boys most of them are just horny and stupid, but JM was defiantly not a rapist, I think I was the only was on his side, everyone turned against him even his own parents and his best friends the teachers wouldn't even speak to him.

We'd marry, get a few cats, have some kids.\n\nThat's all well and good but that was an incredibly violent relationship. She promised to kill one or both of us on several occasions, fucked with the car while I was driving just for the fun of scaring me (which I think is a reasonable fear if you are trying to pull the e-brake or cover my eyes on the highway), was really controlling... just ridiculously abusive.

Let alone all the psychological and physical abuse.\n\nShe had attempted suicide quite a few times, twice directly in front of me. She ended up completing suicide several years after we broke up. If we had moved to Philadelphia I wonder if she would have died even sooner, and if I may have been killed as well. The biggest bullet dodged is that we might've had kids and they would have witnessed or been targets of that violence too.\n\nWhat actually happened was that we broke up a few months after I graduated and never spoke again. I began a long process of healing, with lots of support from people in my hometown, and now lead a fantastic life. She did not graduate, moved to a third state, and died some years later.\n\nI am SO grateful we didn't move to Pennsylvania.

Being shy, I had a couple of my bros accompany me to her house for a swim. She wore a very small bikini, I tried not to look so I wouldn't end up with an awkward boner. While I was changing out of my suit afterwards, she had tried to get into the bathroom but I had locked the door. Meanwhile, my friends were accosted by her father who attempted to evangelize to them. Turns out he was a part of some cult that had a heavily-modified version of the Bible and believed the end of days was coming and they needed to be armed and ready for it. Later found out her parents were both formerly Scientologists but \"wised up\" and got out of it. As my friends were telling me this on the drive home, she started texting me increasingly flirtier texts and a couple suggestive photos. Then she mentioned that she wished she had her driver's license so she could come see me on her own. I asked why she didn't have one. She said it was because she had only just turned sixteen and hadn't passed her test yet.\n\nSo an underage girl trying to seduce me, while belonging to a family of absolute nutcases. Blocked, ignored, cut off. Told the classmate who set me up to go fuck himself.\n\nI later had a date with another girl who I got a weird vibe from, so I ghosted her. She apparently ended up on meth, got pregnant, got off meth, became an alcoholic instead, gained a ton of weight, and to my knowledge is now living with her boyfriend in a trailer park somewhere in New Mexico.\n\nI don't choose my dates anymore.

Went back to court for the car, took another 8 months to sort that out but it was done and she said she was done with me and blocked me. Thank fuck.\n\nCouple years later I get a random message from a random person on Facebook who I've never heard of but they work at a place I also used work at. I accept the message and they let me know that they dated my ex-wife and that she made their life miserable the entire time.\n\nHere's what happened in the time that she blocked me;\n\nCame out a transgender for the clout on twitch. Led a Facebook campaign where she demeaned anyone who called her, now him by the wrong pronouns. Proceeded to be the cheating dumpster fire she was whole her and I were together. Leeched of anyone and everyone she dated and lived with. Attempted to defraud disability by saying her depression was making her unable to work. Got evicted from the house her and I used to rent from screwing everyone else in the house with the same eviction.\n\nOne of her dates described that their 4th date was buying her did for the week. Their 5th date was buying her medication. Yet there was a constant stream of Amazon boxes delivered to her on a weekly basis with a normal turn around date of two days after saying she found something she liked them claiming that someone bought it for her.\n\nI don't talk about her. I don't like to take about her. But she loves to talk about me and how I left her with $15,000 in debt. But she always fails to mention that she was asked to provide a full year of transactions for each store card she had in her possession but only provided the most recent. Then was informed that if she wanted to fight to have that debt responsibility to be mine, to prove that the purchases were either by me or for me. Kind of hard to prove that a 26 year old male would spend over $3,000 on a JC Penny card at their Sephora store. Or $2,000 at Ulta. I did take ownership of the $7,000 bill from one store because both of names were on it and I had used it to buy two computers and a bed set during our 7 years together.\n\nI dodged that bomb and now my life is great! I took 9 months to get training out of state for an IT job that pays me quite well and works well with my needs. Had I still been with her, I know for a fact she would have fought tooth and nail using her textbook of manipulative tactics to stop me.\n\n**While funny, any typos are unintentional as mobile devices do not like to cooperate with me.**",

Thing is, she was obsessed with having kids, and in fact had a 2-year old already. What's more, she had previously confessed to me that she tricked her baby daddy into impregnating her by deliberately going off her birth control without telling him. Fortunately, I had Admiral Ackbar on my side and didn't fall for the trap.\n\nAfter that, over time, she became distant and cool, while also starting to spend lots more time with my younger brother. Eventually, I ended things, and sure enough, a few months later, my brother informs us that he's accidentally gotten her pregnant and he would be moving up to Quebec (where he doesn't speak any French) to raise the child. I ask how this happened, and he tells me \"the condom broke\". Naturally, I then ask \"why didn't she take the morning-after pill\"? To which he replies \"she can't, she's allergic.\" At this point, my bullshit detector is screaming bloody murder. \"What do you mean, 'allergic'?\" I ask. \"She says she gets bad stomach cramps\". Now, as anyone with a uterus knows, cramps are not an allergic reaction to the pill, but a normal and expected side effect.\n\nThey're married now, and she's my sister-in-law. My niece is adorable, but boy oh boy am I glad I didn't have to leave my entire life behind to move to Quebec.",

During the lesson, however, I ended up with some first time skaters during a close quarter exercise that caused a dog pile. In that dog pile, I almost lost my finger due it being pinned to the ice by the front of a figure skate and then got clipped just below my eye with the other figure skate. For those of you unaware of figure skates, the front is kind of jagged to all for stopping and what not. Both skates hit me with that part and it was someone falling on us, so it was nearly a full on kick. Looking back, it was probably dumb but I never pursued hockey again.

He sent me to the hospital and they took one look at my charts and pulled me right through, they put a cannula in my arm in the er and hooked me up to a 20hr drip with the antidote to Panadol in it, my heart rate kept spiking too so all the alarms were going off, they kept hooking me up to ekg machines.\n\nOne thing my doctors said was they had never seen someone with my liver charts who hadn’t been in excruciating abdominal pain and they were shocked they couldn’t find a rash, so what’s scary is if that first doctor in the clinic hadn’t decided to question how much medicine I’d taken, it might’ve not been picked up and could’ve went untreated.\n\nMoral of the story is never administer medicine to yourself if you’re too disoriented to keep track of when you’re taking it.",

When they called me in to take my initial vitals they looked worried. I was admitted immediately because my vitals were so low that the machine could not register them. Turns out I was septic and if I didnt go in I likely would have died.\n\nI was in the hospital for i think 14 days. When I was discharged (mostly because i wanted to go home) i had to continue taking daily antibiotics through a tube in my arm that led to my heart. I forgot what it was called. After 2 weeks i wasnt feeling well again. I had another kidney stone. I was admitted again and spent another 12 days or so in the hospital. This time they lasered all the stones they saw. Dr said he had never seen stones that were so hard they required several shots of the laser to destroy. They put in 2 stents and i still had to get daily antibiotics from a dialysis clinic.\n\nOne good thing that came of this was that my infection kept showing up in my blood work and my infectious disease dr couldnt figure it out. Thought it may be in my spine and sent me for an mri. There wasnt an infection but they did diagnose my back issues which for 20 years i was told was scoliosis and took nsaids for and now they said i had ankylosing spondylitis. I take humira for it and i feel loads better.",

Just never really hit it off with talking to people, especially girls. I would avoid conversations. You know the deal.  \n  \nI left home to transfer to a larger university and forced myself to transform into a more outgoing guy. I was a year older than everyone else. I'm a tall, muscular(ish) guy, now outgoing, and basically just ooze this natural charisma that I was hiding for years. I joined a fraternity to be be around these hot women and hang out with the guys that had the money and threw the best parties on campus. Women loved me for the first time ever and I kinda felt like the popular kids from high school.  \n  \nI go to a fraternity party and I'm talking to several girls but I get absolutely wasted and end up going home with this chick. We went for a roll in the sheets (only my 3rd partner ever at the time). It was good and all. We see each other a few more times but I'm a newly liberated fraternity guy at a campus with nearly 16k other women. I want to keep playing the field for a few years and then start settling down in my Junior or Senior years so now is not the time to be getting stuck on one girl. I nicely break things off with this chick and it all seems so amicable.  \n  \nShe still kept coming around the fraternity house which was cool with me. I didn't think there were any hard feelings. She was always really close by though. Like I'd be talking to other girls or dancing and she was always like 5-10 feet away, by herself just watching me. I thought it was a little creepy but whatever. It's not the largest fraternity house and the party rooms and outdoor area make it easy to find someone, even when you aren't looking so I think nothing much else of it.  \n  \nAfter about 2 weeks of this, she comes to a party and kinda corners me in a hallway. She throws her hand down my pants and tells me that she wants it. Still not really thinking with the right side of my brain, I take her back to my apartment. We have another good time. She spends the rest of the night and morning at my place which is kinda normal for me and girls I was with. She wanted to have a serious conversation about our relationship and I told her that the hookups were fun but I just wasn't settling down yet. It would probably be best if she doesn't make any advancements on me for a little while and I'd let her know when I was interested. I was kind of a dick but I didn't want her messing up the good times I was having.  \n  \nAfter that, she would randomly show up everywhere I was. Restaurants with fraternity brothers. Walking across this big ass campus. The grocery store. Even outside my classes. I would be talking to a group of girls at a party (most just friends or girlfriends of fraternity brothers). I would walk away and she would make a point to come tell them that I was her boyfriend and off limits. At this point, I figured she was stalking me and was a bit scared of her.  \n  \nOne night I was at a friends house pregaming a party. I got a text from her asking where I was and then about 3 brothers asked me the same saying she was at the fraternity house waiting on me. I told her I was at my apartment and then my roommates started texting me that she had shown up there about 20 minutes later. They had let her in and she was sitting at the top of the stairs leading to my room. I went to the party and she was blowing up my phone the entire time asking me where I was and sending me nude pics. I held off on going back home until 3AM thinking she wouldn't be there but she had passed out on the couch in the living room downstairs by the time I got there.  \n  \nI sneaked by her and went upstairs to bed. I was really careful to make sure I locked the door to my room. At around 8AM, someone started banging down my door. At first I had completely forgot she was there and thought it was my roommate trying to get my attention. I opened the door and she ran in my room and started screaming at me asking me where I had been and if I was cheating. I calmly spoke to her with all my roommates and their girlfriends awake outside my door. I told her we weren't dating and we had agreed to that a few weeks earlier. I told her she needed to leave. She wouldn't get up. I about walked over to her to grab her by the arm but thought better of that. I just had this feeling she would try to tell people I was abusive or something. We had to call the cops to get her out of there. As the cops were making her leave, she told them that I had grabbed her and hit her. Thankfully my roommates and their girlfriends were right there to call her a liar and I showed them the text from the night before.  \n  \nA week later, she showed back up at the fraternity house in the middle of the day and wouldn't leave unless I talked to her. I happened to be walking in for lunch about that same time. She hit me with the \"I'm pregnant and it's yours\" line. I called BS immediately because I didn't cum in women back then, like ever. I pulled out because this was a chief worry of mine. I wasn't about to have a kid out of wedlock but I would've done the right thing. I drove her straight to the pharmacy and made her take 3 different test with me back at the fraternity house. All came back negative. She tried to tell me those weren't perfect so I told her we would go to the campus health center and have them do it. If she refused that or refused to show me the results while there, I'd know she was lying. She refused.  \nI used the police report and testimonies from everyone else to help me get a restraining order which she broke multiple times while on campus and it resulted in her being expelled from campus.  \n  \nA year later, a man showed up to our fraternity house asking for me and it was her dad. He told me my name had come up a lot while the girl was in therapy and he wanted to know what had happened. I filled him in on all the details which is tough when you are telling a dad that you had sex with his little girl. Turns out she had only ever had one relationship before me that had lasted for 3 years and ended on her senior prom night the Spring before she came to college and met me. It ended when the guy she was with got into a car wreck going to pick her up to take her to prom. He had died just after she got to the hospital. The guy apparently looked a lot like me and the dad felt that she had tried to fill in that hole in her heart with me. It was kinda sad honestly. I felt horrible for her and her family having to go through all this mess.  \n  \nShe hasn't had an easy life since as I understand it from some of her friends. She married a guy about 2 years later and they both constantly cheated on each other. They both figured having a kid would fix the marriage and it didn't. The girl lost her shit and about committed suicide when the guy showed he wanted a divorce. He ended up keeping custody of the child because of her antics. She then tried to commit suicide again. She's back living with her parents.   Totally sad story and I hate I was a part of it. I know if I had actually gotten her pregnant that I would have lost out on a lot in life due to an unhappy marriage. I wouldn't have my career, my actual wife, or any of the great memories that came after she was in the picture. I know I'm super lucky about it all.",

            "text": "I have 3 that I can think of:\n\n1: When I was younger, (pre-teen years) my mom had just gotten her new Honda Odyssey and got rid of her Ford Taurus. After a day of driving around in her new car, I was in the front passenger seat and it was a regular ride on the freeway (forgot where we were heading to but doesn’t really matter) The vehicle in front of us failed to avoid a large piece of metal debris that was on the road and after running it over, it shot back towards us at high speed in my direction. Luckily it only hit her front bumper and only caused a dent. All I was able to think was, “would that have went straight through the windshield if we were in the Taurus?” I believe the height difference of the Taurus and Odyssey might’ve actually saved me from being decapitated. \n\n2: The night before my 23rd bday, I was out with really close friends of mine at the time and shit hit the fan and we had a pretty bad falling out that night. I was emotionally hurt so my way of coping through it that night was drinking it away. I drank way too much to the point that most of the night was a blur. Anyways, it was 2am and I was trying to call a Lyft to go home (still obliterated) and turns out I never got into my Lyft car. A completely random person drove me 20 miles across town to take me home, also lost my phone in their car that night and that was it. I didn’t realize until the morning after that it wasn’t even the Lyft I was supposed to get into since I reported the phone lost to the company and I was able to get into contact with the actual driver that was supposed to drive me. Fast forward 3 weeks later, I see on the news that the same scenario happened to a girl somewhere in the east coast and she was murdered. Shook me a bit. \n\n3. This year on my 25th bday, a lot of family drama was happening and a huge bomb was dropped on me and once again, I chose to drink the problems away. I was at my family’s place and got so wasted that evening I just ended up passing out in the guest bedroom. Woke up at 3am covered all over in my own vomit (it was a lot of vomit) Luckily I normally sleep on my side cause I don’t think it would’ve been a pretty sight for my mom to see that her son died choking on his own barf.

In the meantime, a consultant had come down to Resus to check on a patient of his before he went home for the night. Apparently out of curiosity, he’d asked what was wrong with me (I was out of it so I never met him), the doctor told him and he authorised to double the amount of medication they were giving me on the basis that if the dosage kills me, I was going to die anyways. The drugs slow my seizures and they rush me to ICU but tell my parents not to get their hopes up because I’m still very sick and I could be in a permanent vegetative state because there’s no way of telling what effects all of the seizures had on my brain. I woke up around 3am in ICU in a very confused/dazed state to my parents holding both of my hands with no lasting damage. In fact, my first thought when I woke up was about how much I needed to go have a wee and how much my dignity would be hurt by having to pee in a bed pan in front of everyone…I walked out of there in full health less than 24 hours later. \n\nFast forward a couple of months, I was cleared to return to University for the new academic year, I transferred to the Master’s program of my course (which I had wanted to do in my second year but due to bad mental health didn’t get the prerequisite grades), in my research year got to be part of a really interesting anti-cancer med project which could potentially help millions and now I’m in my final year just about to apply for Postgrad Medicine.

            "text": "I was interviewing for 2 different jobs. One for a small startup, ~30 employees. The other for a more established company.\n\nPart of the startup's interview process included a 2 HOUR deep dive on my past work experiences where they literally made me take a walk down memory lane and answer all these questions about all my past jobs, name my managers and colleagues, and describe all my highs and lows. Okay... Odd, and deeply personal in some ways. But I went with it.\n\nOverall, both sets of interviews with both companies went really well and we moved on to the references stage.\n\nThe startup proceeds to ask for 6 references, naming EXACTLY WHO they wanted to speak to (including my manager at the time) - the people they'd wanted me to name and talk about about during my 2 hour deep dive interview. Okay, super weird and annoying that they wanted me to reach out to people I hadn't seen in 7 years so they could talk to them. But, fine. I mostly did it- replacing some references with others e.g. my manager. All my references end up mentioning how half the call was spent talking about me while the other half was the startup trying to poach my references. Jesus, wtf? \n\nI eventually got both offers and started weighing the pros and cons to make my decision. \n\nA day or so after the startup tells me about my offer, they send me an email: \"Thought we'd send some Friday cheer your way :)\", with an attachment. I open the attachment. It's a zoom screenshot... with everyone I interviewed in the frame... each of their hands are forming a different shape... which I finally realize are letters - meant to be spelling out my name. Alrighhhhhht then.\n\nA day later, I'm talking to my partner and making dinner when my phone rings. I don't recognize the number, so I joke that it's probably one of those robot calls claiming that I owe the government money - and I pick it up. It's the startup CEO calling me at 8pm asking if I have any questions or want to talk things out to help with my decision. Cool cool cool...\n\nAt this point, this company seems to be so invested in getting me to take the job, and a part of me truly feels like I owe it to them to say yes. But I end up taking the other offer after going through lots of deliberation, pros, and cons.\n\nA week later, one of the employees who interviewed me reaches out to me on LinkedIn. They tell me they'd just left the company. We connect and set up a call - I'm so curious why they left when they seemed so happy. During the call, they proceed to lay out how toxic the work environment was and how it took everything in them to not let that show during the interview.\n\nEveryone worked till at least 7pm each day, and this particular person would barely break for dinner before they had to be back in front of the screen. The CEO had everyone's phone number \"just in case\" and it wasn't uncommon for then to call employees at 10pm, 11pm because of an \"emergency\" that \"just couldn't wait till the next day\". They would discourage people from going out of the office for lunch (pre-pandemic days) because \"what if other people end up wanting to leave the office too?\" If anyone complained about being overworked, they were gaslit or reminded that \"this is a startup\". They had mandatory \"happy hours\" on Friday that STARTED at 5pm, went till 7pm, after which people would continue working to wrap up for the week. If anyone wanted to take time off, they'd be reminded that \"this is a startup\" or accused of not caring about their teammates or told that it was too short notice. Everything was urgent all the time. And anyone who worked overtime, weekends, or during vacation or holidays would be propped up and given kudos.\n\nSo, yeah. I guess saying no was the best decision I had made in while?",

I was sleeping with a towel under my head because I would just drool in my sleep.\n\nGot into the doctor (PA in this case) who looked quickly, said, \"yup, that looks like strep\" and gave me a five-day Z-pack (antibiotics). Started taking them that night, 24 hours later my right tonsil was back to normal but the left wasn't. It was now Friday night and I would've had to go to urgent care for anything (yay USA). Still couldn't swallow without a lot of pain, had to get a bag of fluid for dehydration, but kept on the antibiotics. I could barely talk, sounded like I had a balloon in my throat. I used a pen and paper to communicate.\n\nSunday rolls around and I can't handle it, go to walk-in and happen to get my doctor from when I was a kid. He chats with my dad, looks at it and says, \"yeah, the ENT (ear, nose, and throat doctor) should check that, they might need to drain it.

Did the walkthrough, called the specialist and made it in for 2:30pm (the earliest the could see me).\n\nThe PA (a different one) checks my throat and says, \"whoa, the doctor will want to see this\" and goes to get them. He comes in, looks for maybe a full minute and says, \"those need to come out, today. Like right now.\" By 3:15 I'm getting prepped for surgery, emergency tonsillectomy. \n\nWhen I woke up, my now wife (we'd been dating for only a few months) was there, the doctor came in and said what was going on. My left tonsil abscessed, and if they hadn't removed it - my throat would've been closed off in 12-24 hours.\n\nThat would've meant I was either sleeping, or home alone in our new place with no way to communicate, suffocating on my own tonsil. I lost 16lbs (7.3kg) in two weeks from barely eating, and could've died without the surgery.",

When I was younger I got pneumonia every fall like clockwork into early adulthood until I learned how to manage it and then it was just bronchitis every fall instead. I had been doing pretty good the past couple of years of managing it to the point where I didn't even get bronchitis. Then one day I get a little cough and it feels like bronchitis. Also I start having this back spasm, so I'm worried that a coughing fit pinched something. I've already had my covid vaccination so I'm not too worried. But I want to get a jump on the cough and have my back checked out so I go to urgent care. They do some tests, I get an x-ray, and they come back with pneumonia. No problems with my vertebrae, probably just a pulled muscle. I get the typical antibiotics and directions to pump fluids and get plenty of rest. They give me a little sphigmometer to do breathing exercises and I'm out the door and back home. I lay in bed with my soup watching TV most of the day. I pump the fluids. The back spasms have mostly subsided and I'm in a comfortable position where I can breath and relax. \n\nTHEN I have to go to the bathroom. As soon as my second foot hits the floor the back spasm hits. It wraps all the way around to my belly and I can't breath. It's like some bully punched me in my gut as hard as they could. I was doing that desperate wheezing inhale. I'm in panic mode. I try to find any position to help the spasm stop and be able to breath but I can't. The best I can do is these short shallow and very rapid breaths like someone hyperventilating. I keep trying to tell myself \"it's just a pinched nerve, give it a minute and it will calm down\". It didn't. It wasn't. \n\nAs best I could I called 911 and started making my way to the front porch of my house doing tiny little sliding steps. Full steps would kick the spasm into high gear again. The ambulance came and coaxed me onto a cart and whisked me off to the ER. I found out that I had clots in both lungs and the lower part of one lung was starting to become necrotic. If I would have waited to for the spasms to subside I would have died. \n\nI spent the next 4 days in the hospital on blood thinners with a plan to be on them for another 6 months afterwards. No idea where they came from or how it happened. Just a \"it happens to some people, we don't know why, maybe sitting too long...\" Scariest thing that has ever happened to me.

This was our third year volunteering for the job so by this time we’d shelved the ginormous binder of documentation that had been handed down to us, smoothed out any kinks around the PTA budget, fundraising, volunteers, and an extra cool bonus was that our kids now knew the ropes and were stoked on helping so we gave them jobs too and were all working and part of the show. (2nd grade gal was handing out programs, our 3rd grade gal lead upcoming student performers to the green room backstage, and our 5th grade son was in charge of stage lights). \nThis year, we went all out and spent the entire budget -most of it going toward hiring a local AV guy who brought an entire setup of stage lights, a spot light, and a PA system which, combined with the decorations and concessions gave the auditorium an indoor concert vibe - really profesh, super exciting for the kids performing, and a cool show for the audience of their younger siblings and all their friends and families.    \nEveryone was having so much fun and the program was running like clockwork. My man and I were perfectly in sync all evening while directing backstage, setting up mics and chairs, moving the piano, and holding back happy/proud tears while we watched the kids from behind the curtain - he was stage-left and I was stage-right. There had been about 30 acts of kids performing whatever (school appropriate) performance they wanted to share on stage. We had dancing, singing, piano, violin, lip-syncing, choreographed light saber battles, roller skates routines, hula-hoops, monologues, karate demonstrations, jump ropes, tap dancing! The music was loud, the little kids whose older siblings were on stage were beaming and screaming and rushing the stage when their brother or sister was up there shining in front of everyone they know! \n\nThe last number and finale would be the 5th grade Guitar Club playing a Bob Marley's One Love. The instructor would play quietly on the side and I know a bit so he brought in his (really pretty and expensive) bass and asked me to play along with them in the background. \n\nThe second to last number, a trio of dancing girls, were in their places on stage and waiting for my son to turn off the lights which would cue the AV guy to announce the girls' dance, the curtain would open, and their music would start.  \nI had checked that guitars wouldn't be sticking out backstage and while headed to the front I pick up the bass and as I’m putting it over my head and moving back into view I hear the announcer say the dancers names and the curtain starts to open!\nI was in full view and start rushing my ass toward my front, stage-right spot as fast as my black wedges and skinny pants can move when the lights turn out! Its pitch black and I'm dashing forward, holding the bass and 3 feet from my spot when I TRIP SO HARD on the foot of a light stand! \nI FLEW through the air, my were feet off the ground I'm about to crash head-first through the unopened curtain while holding that beautiful bass guitar. I closed my eyes, yelled \"SHIIiiiiiitt!\" and crashed SO FUCKING HARD RIGHT INTO MY HUSBAND!!!! He was RIGHT THERE! WHY!?! He hadn't been on my side of the stage the ENTIRE night! WHY WAS HE STAGE-RIGHT!??!!\nI had to have been flying at a 40 degree angle when my shoulders and face rammed into his sexy chest. Whatever noise we made was drowned out by the dance music and when the show lights flashed across our faces my husband, son and I were all like WTF HOLY CRAP that was almost so bad what the hell just happened! \nAfter that the guitar club (plus bass!) kicked ass on their song, the audience joined in singing One Love at the end, and we went home with our hearts overflowing with love for the performers, excitement that the show went so marvelously, and immeasurable relief that I didn’t dive through that curtain.\nWhy was he stage-right!? \nI love him so much that I believe it was kismet.",

My parents were helping out in the purchase of the property and were also in town on the day. \n\nWe went to inspect the house with my parents, and everything was looking good. My mother asked the real estate agent what the neighbours were like, and the agent said he had only spoken to the neighbours on one side, but that they were nice. \n\nWe negotiated pricing for the property, and came down to a verbal agreement with the agent to send through the paperwork to start the formal proceedings. That night we cracked the champaigne in celebrations, and I started doing some research on the area. \n\nIt quickly came to my attention that there was a new service station (Gas Station) being put into the local area, including a 24 hour drive through service. Digging further, it became obvious that the reason the real estate agent had not spoken to the neighbours on the other side, was that they had sold thier properties to a developer and that entire property was to become the service station.\n\nAn immediate email was sent to the Real Estate agent withdrawing our verbal offer (no signed contract thankfully), and bluntly called him a scammy bastard.\n\nI moved somewhat close to the location, and recently found that the service station has been built, and that 24 hour drive through turned out to be a McDonalds. The drivethrough's collection window would have been less then 10 metres away from the exterior wall for the master bedroom...\n\nTL;DR: about to buy house, found service station being built next door with 24 hour drivethrough.

I was annoyed at first but realized that it ran during the afternoons so I'd have to leave the office at 1 & I'll be done after 4 after my training sessions.\n\nDay 2 doing my new job & training program & my boss calls me to remind me to leave \"early\" so that I have time to get something to eat & can focus in my training sessions.\nIt was about 1240. I had planned to leave at 1 but thought extra time for lunch isn't a bad thing at all. So I exit the meeting room with my laptop & backpack heading to my car.\nThe cars are parked in a parkade across the street. Separate building. Being such an obscure time of the day, the parkade is not busy. I parked on 4th floor & there's only 2 people in the lift with me. One lady whose trying to strike up a conversation & a serious looking guy who is on his Bluetooth earpiece & holding a briefcase.\n\nThe lady gets off on 1. Thankfully. Nice & quiet. Whilst the guy is cursing his network dropping - parkade is made of concrete so the network sucks.\n\nWe both get off at 4. But I have a thought in my head. My laptop charger is still on my desk.

I ignore it as I don't have that much time to waste.\nI get back to the 4th floor 15-20 minutes later - stopped to grab lunch at the canteen to go - & the security won't let me out. There's police everywhere with sirens & not the normal police. These guys look more like detectives Vs ordinary cops.\n\nTurns out Mr briefcase man was a hot shot lawyer. He had a case that week where he was a key witness against a high ranking political figure. He had 2 hitmen waiting for him at his car. They gunned him down. Took his briefcase & phone & left on a superbike.\n\nThe bullets sprayed into the concrete by the elevators.

Since our house is on a hill the yard surrounding the pool area maintains that hill and the pool area was cut into the hill and leveled with a large retaining wall and terraced gardens on one side and a fence with woods beyond on the other. \n\nAnyways, he was on the hill with the excavator parked facing down the hill he was next to it up against the fence (vertical metal bars) working on a tree when he noticed that the excavator was starting to tip, he had parked it oddly or something I wasn’t there to witness this part.

I was traveling with my dad and sister through Europe to visit my dad’s family and homeland.  We visited many places along the way.  We were leaving Amsterdam and taking an overnight bus to get to our destination.  As we prepared to board the bus, our friend told us that we should to hurry to snag the “best” seats at the back of the bus.  The thought was that those seats would be the most comfortable for lying/sleeping across which was valuable for a small family with kids.  However, I guess we didn’t arrive early enough, because there were only two open seats left on the back row.  We had to settle for seats in the middle of the bus since we wanted to sit together.  \n\nFast forward to that evening, middle of the night.  I remember sleepily opening my eyes and realizing that we were stopped.  I looked around and saw my dad get up out of his seat and walk to the front of the bus to see what was going on.  We were stopped on the shoulder of the highway, but also partially in the lane of travel, because the bus was so big/wide.  Moments later there was a very loud hissing noise—tires on wet pavement.  There was a gigantic impact and loud slamming noises.  We lurched forward and flew through the air.  The bus rolled sideways (I think it rolled 3.5 times total).  People and seats were tumbling everywhere.  After we came to a stop, I looked around for my sister and we found each other instantly.  We were in pain and beaten up, but OK.  We could not find my dad and started panicking a bit, so we immediately started trudging toward the front (exit) of the bus.  We passed many injured and bleeding people along our way; it was a tangle of dislodged seats and arms and legs.  I finally saw my dad near the front of the bus and let out a huge sigh of relief.  We hugged and walked out of the bus to a chaotic scene.  \n\nA semi truck had plowed into us from behind, at almost full speed, on the German autobahn.  The passengers on the back row were not moving—dead or paralyzed.  If I remember correctly, there were three fatalities, all at the very back of the bus.  Major injuries (paralyzation, internal injuries) were prevalent among those seated near the rear. \n\nAs you can imagine, I am glad we did not arrive earlier to the bus station that day.",

They refused to understand I had been sick for half a year and was losing weight.  Got fed up and just went to an ER.\n\nThe doctor there listened closely, did an exam, then ordered an ultrasound.  When the results came back he immediately ordered a CT.  A little while later I was admitted.  Once I'd been settled into my room a team of urologists came up.  Kidney cancer, early stage.  3 weeks later I had surgery to have it removed.  4 years later it is no longer an issue and likely never will be again.  If I'd listened to the first doctor, or the second, or the third, I would be dead right now.\n\nIf you know something is not right and feel like your doctor is wrong or not taking you seriously, go to a different one.  Keep going until you're satisfied.  Often an ER will do precautionary scans that private doctors won't order, or that will take months to schedule if they do.  You know your body better than anyone else.",

            "text": "I was racking my brain trying to think of something to post here, when the most obvious answer popped back into my head. I’ve largely tried to erase it from my mind because of how traumatic it was. And before I go on, yes, this was largely my own fault. \n\nTo put it mildly, I was pretty insecure in the years after I graduated college. I had no fucking clue what I wanted to do with my life, and I was questioning whether I had just wasted money on a useless degree. I was single, at that specific time my dating life was not going very well, and I only had really one friend who lived nearby. Needless to say, when I matched with an attractive girl on a dating site, I immediately tried to make something happen with her. \n\nShe wasn’t interested in dating, but she suggested a beneficial relationship. Essentially, she had a kid, and was a single mom. If I helped her with some bills, which at the time I did have some income that I could expend, she would be willing to provide me with what I really wanted: sex. I should make it clear, my sex life was not nonexistent, but the job I was working at the time had some odd hours that made a normal dating life difficult. Essentially we had this arrangement for a few months, then she dropped off the radar, I come to find her again a few months later, and try to re-initiate the arrangement we had. She agreed, and gave me her address, I had been to her home once before, she lived with her mom, but the story was that her mom was out of town frequently, hence why she was usually the only one there.\n\nThis particular time, I saw no reason to believe anything was amiss. When I went into her home, her dog jumped on me, so she excused herself from the bedroom to put the dog upstairs. I heard some footsteps, only to see a gun pointed in my face. It turns out that I was being set up for a robbery. But this is actually not the “nuke” that I dodged.\n\nYou see, they had stolen not only money from me, but also my phone, and strangely my shoes. But they allowed me to leave, I immediately went to the nearest convenience store, and used their phone. This was a small suburban town, so when I told them I’d been robbed, not only was every cop there in mins, but they made sure to follow up with me frequently. \n\nI’ll speed this up a little bit since it is getting long, but essentially the next day I received a phone call from a police detective. He asked me a few questions, specifically if I knew about her “illness.” I told him I didn’t know about any illness that she had, and that is when he informed me that she had AIDS. My heart stopped. I immediately arranged to get tested, but the next available date for me to be able to go wouldn’t be until the following Monday. The immediate results were negative, but it wasn’t until a few weeks later that I was able to get conclusive negative results.\n\nMy life is far from perfect right now, I still have a lot of shit to learn, and I still make mistakes, but that really put some shit into perspective. I have a steady job now, and a beautiful loving girlfriend, and I hope I never have to go back to the dark place I was when that happened.",

There was NEVER a time I was alone with the daughter nor am I a pedo; this was a way to get back at her mom.  I walk in the door and a few minutes later, the cops and paramedics are knocking on the door; my wife called them to talk some sense into her daughter.  Not usually a good idea.  I had a cop standing over me for 30 minutes while I sat on the couch as the paramedics talked to the daughter in another room.  Finally they came out, talked to the cop, and they all left together; the daughter apologized later.  The situation could have totally gone in a different direction if the cop had been overzealous and jumped to conclusions. I shudder to the thought that I could have been arrested, lost my job, lost friends, or put in jail for something that I would never have done.\n\nWe separated less than a year later and I never saw her kids again after I moved out.  It's sad, really.  The abuse from her first husband really gave her trust issues which contributed significantly to our eventual divorce.  It was sad to watch these two girls put in the middle between their two parents.  I gave it a chance (actually, a lot of chances) but there was so much anger in that house which wore down even my easy going, personal responsibility nature and I caught myself a few times not living to the standard that I had set for myself before I was married.",

One day I was driving down the freeway doing about 65mph when a full size wooden pallet fell off a truck in front of me. Cars on both sides, couldn't swerve in time and had to drive full speed right over that fucking pallet. Punctured my tire and fucked up my steering so the car pulled to the left from that point forward. That was the bullet I dodged. A couple of weeks later I'm driving north on the 101 heading back to the city, doing 70 no traffic jams and I'm dying for a cigarette, but the car lighter doesn't work. Genius that I was at the tender age of 22, I decided it was feasible to light a cigarette using a book of matches. Alas, I never mastered the art of lighting a paper match one handed, so I had to let go of the wheel long enough to light a match. The car was still pulling to the left and at 70mph, the second it took to light the match put me on a  collision course with the cement center divider of the freeway. So I grab the wheel and not being much of a seasoned driver at that point, I hit the breaks and yank hard to the opposite side, the car goes into a manic spiral crashes at full speed into the cement divider and literally bounces off across two lanes into the middle of the freeway. The force of the crash into the divider threw the automatic gear handle into reverse and knocked my foot off the break pedal so when I slam on the break I end up flooring the gas pedal instead sending the car back in reverse, engine screaming into that same divider again. The impact of that rear collision dislodged the jack from the back of the waggon, it hurled through the rear window over the divider about 60 feet into the southbound lanes. I have no idea how I survived that shit show with cars coming at me and crashing into a wall, not once but twice. When CHP came on the scene and looked at my car which looked like  an accordion they couldn't believe I didn't roll it. It looked like those cars you see in junk yards after they get compacted. I got out of it with burn on my shoulder blade from the seatbelt. That was the nuke. So yes! Smoking is very dangerous as is the stupidity of young drivers.",

We went through an tour company that planned educational trips like this. They handle all of the booking, tickets, transportation, hotels, etc…\n\nAbout 3 weeks prior to our planned day to leave, the company called our teacher and asked which flight she preferred, one going from our hometown to NYC and then direct to Paris or one from our hometown to London and then on to Paris. She didn’t want to go through a NYC airport with a bunch of kids and knew it would be very busy with people coming to the US for the Olympics going on at the same time. She opted for the flight going direct to London and then on to Paris. \n\nWe left on July 17th, 1996. The flight was uneventful. When we finally reached Paris and walked off the jetway into the terminal and to baggage claim, there are news cameras everywhere. Took us a while to realize what was going on. Eventually we see a newspaper that mentioned TWA Flight 800 had crashed. \n\nTWA Flight 800 left from NYC on that July 17th (the same day we left) and had a group of fellow high school students who were going to France just like us under the same booking company. Had our teacher not picked to leave from our hometown and fly to London then Paris and instead opted to leave from New York that day, we would have been on that flight. It was definitely weird and sad being there and knowing that 17 other students were supposed to be there with us who didn’t make it.",

            "text": "Gonna preface this with, this one is dark and leave a trigger warning for rape.\n\n\nWhen i was 17(m) i had a friend (19f) who i will refer to as Lisa. Id known Lisa for the majority of my being in high-school, so about 3 years. We were best friends and would hang out all the time. Eventually we ended up dating when i was 17 and while we were hanging out at my place we ended up making out. I was happy enough just doing this because this was actually my first time making out with a girl; but she wasnt. I repeatedly told Lisa that i did not want to go any further but she was not having it, and forced me to. (My parents were also home at the time which is the major reason why i never told them about this, i know that it would devastate them)\n\nBeing only my second relationship,  and the fact that i had just lost my virginity to rape, I was confused to say the least. All i knew was, I used to really like this girl, and she used to be really nice to me, and i felt like i should just let this slide; especially with all the new emotions that i had never felt before that come with having sex. This was obviously the wrong choice and the relationship spiraled out of control in terms of manipulation, and emotional abuse bad enough that all of this still affects me.  (im 24 now). Just one of the things she did was share photos of me to all the girls in the school, which, she denied at the time but i know for a fact because her mother told me later that she had shown her, as well as Lisa's sister, which was even worse because she was only 14 at the time.\n\nFast forward about 4-5 months later and me, Lisa, her sister, her boyfriend, and her mother were all eating dinner at Chili's, or something similar (her mother's ideal of fine dining). She dropped the most ridiculous thing i ever heard onto me. She told me that her mother had got pregnant 17, she got pregnant at 18, so it was prophecy (literally the word she used) that Lisa would get pregnant while she was 19, and that there wasnt much time left, and we had yo act fast. I let her know that i really was not in a position to be wanting kids, and i wasnt sure if i even ever would. I told her flat out that i would not do this and she told me that it was either get her pregnant or break up with Lisa. All while actinglike this was a completely normal dinner conversation. I didnt know what to say and was so embarrassed by the whole thing so i just let it slide and ended ul talking to Lisa later. Lisa told me not to worry about it, that she didnt want kids either, and I felt relieved.\n\nWe had always used condoms as birth control, and, i had a habit of checking each wrapper for air leaks to make sure none were damaged. Again, never having done this stuff before i thought one in a box that was damaged was just normal, well, more and more in the box was broken and i was thinking maybe this brand is just going downhill. So we switch to different condoms until finally a few more months after the \"prophecy\" incident i found a box where 2/3rds of the whole box had holes in them. I knew that this couldnt have been a coincidence anymore so i spoke up and Lisa got upset and said i was over-reacting and to hurry up and pick one. I said no, and it wasnt long after that that we broke up. Turns out she was seeing another guy (i think he was mid 20's) and they started dating. She got pregnant a few months later.\n\nMy experience with her was awful, and it has completely screwed up my choice in women. I just recently got out of a different emotionally abusive relationship that i am only just now realizing this trauma with Lisa was why i put up with so much abuse. Having said that, i cannot imagine what would have happened if she or her mother had succeeded in their plot to get Lisa pregnant. One of the scariest thoughts that I have frequently is if it had gone differently, i could still be in an awful abusive relationship with the person who raped me, with a kid that i never wanted, and never being able to get anywhere in life.",

One morning I was walking from my room to the kitchen and fainted twice from being so short of breath. I had to go into my husband’s room to beg him to take me to the ER because I didn’t think I needed an ambulance but I knew I couldn’t drive myself. He begrudgingly dropped me off at the ER and went back home to bed after making sure I knew he thought I was faking it for attention. I could barely stay conscious enough to tell the admitting desk what was wrong. They rushed me to a bed and immediately started me on blood thinners before they even took imaging of my lungs for a proper diagnosis. Turns out, I had over 30 large pulmonary embolism in both of my lungs, both my lungs were partially collapsed, and I had pneumonia. I was in ICU for 5 days, and in the hospital a total of 9 days. The ER doc told me I was within an hour of being dead if I had not come in to the ER when I did. The scary part was about a year and a half later I was in such a deep depression that when I started getting out of breath again and recognized the symptoms, I put off going to the hospital hoping it would kill me. Fortunately I had a dear friend talk some sense into me. I am now in a much healthier place, physically, and mentally, and the cruel husband is now the cruel ex-husband.",

His best friend was in the drivers seat and my boyfriend was sitting in the passenger seat. It was a coupe so my boyfriend had to get out of the car to let me squeeze into the backseat. I was so freaking close to asking him if I can sit in the front instead (I get really bad carsick in the back no matter how short the trip, so I always ask for the front seat). But, I thought to myself our destination is only a block away so just let him have it. That’s one of the last things I remember about that night. I woke up to people yelling and trying to pull me out of the car. When I got out, the car was barely recognizable. The entire thing was mangled and crushed except for the back seat where I was sitting. A drunk driver ran a red light at the intersection where we were driving and hit us. My boyfriend died instantly from the impact and his best friend was in a coma for almost a year. It’s been 6 years and he never made a full recovery. Death isn’t the only nuke I dodged that night, tho. When people were pulling me out of the car, I remember they had trouble getting the seat belt off of me. I thought that was fuckin weird since I NEVER wore seatbelts. Seriously, I absolutely refused. I told the people that was impossible and they said they unclicked the seatbelt themselves and the Police told me it was a good thing, since the seatbelt saved me from a lot of damage. They also asked me if I was drinking or distracted that night, which I wasn’t drinking. But I do remember replying to a text when we were approaching that intersection(which again, I normally would NEVER do bc of car sickness). The police said because I wasn’t aware of my surroundings and bracing for the impact, my body was kinda “loose” when the car hit us and that assisted in my body taking the least amount of resistance (I walked out with a bruise on my knee and that’s about it).",

            "text": "Years ago I was in top level government job and wanted to leave. I was informed that a lobbyist wanted to open a branch of his firm in the capital and was looking for someone with exactly my profile to be head of the branch. I met with him and got uncomfortable really fucking fast. The man had no idea what he was talking about, setting expectations that were not plausible in the slightest. In my experience people in that line of work that have that much of a disconnect with reality tend to be « fixers » instead of legitimate lobbyist, as in instead of putting the work in to convince the government of their objectives they do illegal things to buy their way in. I politely declined the job offer. \n\nA year or two later, I had become head of a powerful business network/lobbying institution. A few weeks after my hiring had been announced in the newspapers I was contacted again by that man. He also had changed jobs and was now head of some sort of business school for high ranking public officials in local administrations that was funded near entirely by his political contacts (school that, coincidentally, had the same initials as him…).  He wanted desperately to sign a contract with us for cooperation. I got, what, three to five messages a week on his part for two months ? I said no, politely at first but  quite firmly the more he insisted. There was just something that felt… off with his insistence, especially considering his local political contacts already managed to bully my members in the place he had his school set up in into signing a contract with him, a contract that they (wisely) managed to prevent from having any legal value whatsoever. The contract he was proposing had no added value, be it for my workplace or his except the ability to make a press release about it. Note, by the way, that a lot of my members actually provided the same services as he did so we would basically be helping a concurrent. \n\nUnderstanding that my door was closed he called the chair of my board and tried to convince her, using the same tactics. When she told me, I advised her to redirect any new inquiries from him to me and refuse to talk with him. \n\nThat’s when I got news from my aunt. See, my aunt was at the time one of the highest ranking public servants in the State and was approached too. She had the same feeling as I did and blocked him out but that got her curious. She discreetly looked into the inner workings of his business and his accounting. She… was not pleased with what she discovered to say the least. Word quickly got around to stay the fuck away from that man. My father, who is the owner of one of the biggest newspaper of the place, began to investigate and was quietly notified by the police to back off. \n\nA year later the man was arrested. The formation he was supposedly providing his students never existed. Only one class ever graduated. He took millions from his school to funnel into his failing business, with whom he had made the school sign a contract for paid services (a HUGE legal no-no). And that’s without talking about the wages he took from the school that were unheard of for a school of that size. Quickly it appeared that the school mainly served as a way for high ranking people to network together and go on « teaching trips » in foreign countries. The police arrested a lot of high ranking public officials that funded him, discovering payouts or in some cases sexual relationships between them and some of the workers of the school (which is illegal in my country: if you have a « personal interest » in a place you can’t decide anything related to that place). The trial is impending. \n\nTLDR: years ago I declined a job offer by a man I immediately distrusted. Some times later he tried to bully me in my new job to help him out in his new business. I refused. A year or two later he got arrested for corruption and fraud.",

I couldn’t walk through the gym building at my school (shortcut from where I usually parked, and warmer than the outside route!), I couldn’t look at a baseball field, I couldn’t wear crop tops or leggings, etc. Totally controlling. Extremely emotionally abusive and gaslit the Shit out of me. Gave me a concussion so bad I couldn’t read the next day. Kicked like 20+ dents in my car. Stained my interior roof lining red from a Taco Bell slushy he threw at me. Didn’t let me stay at my dorm because I was cheating even though his parents were VERY unhappy I was always over. Poured water on me and locked me outside in wet clothes (often after I woke up so it would be just a shirt and underwear) in winter. Refused to get out of my car when I tried to leave once so after spending a half hour asking, then telling, then letting him know if he didn’t gtfo of my car he’d be coming to my dorm and could find his own way home as I wasn’t letting him in, I left with him in my backseat. He threw himself out ON THE ROAD and lied saying he told some people walking he almost got kidnapped and called the cops on me. Had horrible road rash from it. Tried to kill us driving on the wrong side of the road in broad daylight. I stopped being able to sleep because he’d go through my phone at night while I slept and get mad I spoke to FRIENDS.\n\nThis man was PSYCHO. An abusive, raging porn addict. He refused to get a job or do anything but smoke weed and fill his ENTIRE phone storage with screenshots of Instagram models. We couldn’t save a picture together on his phone. The one time he had a job he quit after two weeks. Wouldn’t let me bring groceries to his house so I only got food if we ate fast food, which got REALLY expensive. I spent like 6k on this man from Christmas 2019 to the end of March 2020. This doesn’t count our meals. Doesn’t count my gas driving 45 minutes to his house, 30 to the breakfast spot he liked, then 3+ into the mountains every day. Doesn’t count car maintenance. Doesn’t count the clothes he made me buy. I drained my savings. I drained my spending account. I drained the money my family gave for Christmas as I was moving back to my home state to continue college and see him. \n\nAs you know, Covid ramped up 2020 pretty fast. I go to school in Seattle, which was a HUGE hotspot. My mother insisted I came home to their state, a three hour flight away. I refused. I hate planes. I’d be fine staying in the “dorm.” My bf at the time knew I had sensitive lungs from childhood illness and would come up with a Covid story every day to scare me into thinking we’d been exposed. Each week my mom would urge me to come home, crying on the phone. I was terrified of Covid, rightfully so, and so was she. But I knew if I left he would be so mad at me. He’d punish me by refusing to talk to me for days like he did when I was out of state helping my family move. He’d cheat more. He’d block me for days living with other women pretending he was just mad at me.\n\nFinally, as big name campuses were shutting down and sending students home with 24hour or less notice, I figured it was time to go home to my family. Quarantine was becoming a big and scary thing and my mother and I both feared that if I didn’t come home immediately, I’d be stuck in the hotspot unable to leave. My family flew out to see me on the next flight and we drove back, 24 hours all in one shot. I stayed inside for a year while he continued his shitty treatment towards me. He’d tell me to move on and we were over,then get mad when I hung out with another guy (I’m young, was single, had fun and realized I can’t keep up with the hoe phase) and spam call me.  He’d tell me he was killing himself because of me. He sort of stopped when I began telling his friends to check on him after he’d stop replying to me, but it happened so much. Everything was so much for being almost 2k miles away. \n\nAnd one day, after recording so many abusive phone calls where he’d tell me to slit my wrists or overdose again or get r*ped, I think he realized I was building a case against him. He scared me telling me he’d get me arrested instead since he was huge on reactive abuse and I gave up being kind to him when he was being verbally abusive to me. I didn’t go to the police. I didn’t ever file insurance claims for my car. I regret it so much because this shitty man is out there, proud to own a gun and probably finding another target for his shit. What can you do though.\n\nI’m alive, and if it wasn’t for Covid I know I would have been killed based on how hard he threw me into a window IN THE CAR while driving. I couldn’t read the next day. My brain looked at words I had known forever and they didn’t make sense. I’m lucky that was as bad as I got harmed I think. Covid saved my life while also being my biggest fear. \n\nNow I’m fully vaccinated and dating a man who has made me realize why people actually WANT to get married. The night and day difference is… crazy. \n\nFor anyone suffering from abuse, my dms are open. There is light at the end. Leaving isn’t easy for many reasons, but for those of you who are ready and sitting on the fence, do it. Be cautious, have a plan, let someone know, but DO IT.",

My blood pressure was 72/46 (approximately, I forget the exact number). 12 hr surgery, multiple organ failure, 2 comas, blood loss, grand mal seizures, memory loss, pneumonia, breathing and feeding tube, atrophy of legs, and 6 more months in the Icu, 3 months at home care, relearning to walk, move, eat, had ileostomy. All because the assholes at the hospital thought I was a druggy.",

Right before I grabbed it I tripped on a rock and stumbled like 6 feet down the side of the outcrop. My uncle came running over and he actually seen the big snake chilling there and seen me crying and said \"you woulda been more than crying if you grabbed that snake boy.\"",

He was working as an SVP for a mid size consulting firm (~600 employees) when he had city investigators show up because he was being accused of having tried to reach out to the NYC dept of transportation for insider info on upcoming contracts. The reality is my father had worked in the DOT for 20 years before going into consulting, & had just been speaking to a secretary or office engineer he had hired while there about how their life was going non business. But since he used the office phone, accusations were made by others, he had a tabloid article written about him about NYC engineering corruption lol (my dad wrote the writer an email asking her if she would like to actually speak to him so she can be informed & retract her bunk story.. She obviously never responded). His boss didn't like the negative attention and basically started distancing from my father. My father had to go to a deposition where he successfully proved that he was never talking about anything business related but simply having a personal conversation with a personal relationship. But because things became so awkward at work my dad told his boss that he'll resign if it makes things easier for them, and my father said his boss didn't push back against that at all and just said yes. I think that hurt my father more than anything considering this boss was the guy who convinced my father leave his government tenured position as Deputy Commissioner and come work in Consulting in the first place and now he's leaving him out to dry.\n\nWell the joke is on them because my father's name was cleared and he ended up at a much larger consulting firm (~4k employees) & ended up one of the main construction managers on the Mario Cuomo Bridge which was the largest civil engineering contract New York City has had in the past like 50 years. And his old company ended up getting raided by the FBI because it turns out my dad's old boss had illegally owned two other construction firms on the side under the names of his friends when he was really the one in bankrolling it the whole time. And he also was having all his employees get $500 donations to the mayors when he was running for office in order to circumvent the dollar limit that one person could give, and then the CEO was just paying that $500 back to all the employees as year end bonuses. So this CEO was able to give tens of thousands of dollars in donations should the marriage even though you're only allowed to give $500 or something. And then they found out he had a mole in the government office who was leaking major government contracts so that this eeo could develop better proposals faster. So it turns out this guy was corrupt as f*** and he didn't want to protect my father who was clean because he didn't want any of the extra attention on his Shady back dealings.

She kept telling me she lost the dog further and further into the woods, and we finally got to a place where I was unfamiliar and I started getting sketched out.\n\nFinally I saw some movement deeper in the trees and there were 2 men crouched back there hiding. I still remember one was wearing a white T-shirt and the other was in a white A-shirt.\n\nI turned and booked it and she was yelling at me to come back - there was a bunch of commotion behind me and I wasn’t able to move very quick in the roller blades so I thought I was a goner.\n\nJust when I was about to shit myself out of sheer terror of what’s to come a group of high school kids from my apartments that biked back there came popping out of a trail near some jumps they had and stopped when they saw me doing my damndest to sprint in roller blades down the path they were turning on to.\n\nI ran to them and turned around and the dudes were ducking back into the thicker foliage and the woman was nowhere to be seen.\n\nI explained what happened and they walked me back out to the parking lot and that was the end of it.\n\nI didn’t tell my parents because I thought they’d be furious I was so stupid as to fall for that age old trick... so I wonder now if those people ever ended up hurting other kids and I regret not saying anything. Granted - I’m not sure they could have done much back before everyone had a camera in their pocket, but it still weighs on me.",

Straight shots on interstate and some side roads and it’s normal to travel at high rates of speed in daytime hours. Headed back from Sioux Falls meeting to Pierre with my coworker in a 1995 Buick Park Avenue that was about 48ft long and handled like a boat that size, but could get up past 100mph pretty easily on the straight SoDak roadways. \n\nWe stopped at a gas station halfway back and my coworker says (doesn’t ask) “you drive the rest of the way.” I don’t want to because I’m tired but he insists that I’m driving which was not normal for him to be assertive in anyway. So I said sure and took the keys. \n\nRest of the trip was uneventful until about 10 miles outside Pierre, SD. I’m pushing the Park Avenue to 110-115 to get home, which was normal for that stretch of Highway. We come to a slight bend in the road way that had a small rise where I could see about 100 ft of roadway which wasn’t a big deal. Came over the rise and two semis were crossing the Highway perpendicular from a side farm road.  There was no way I could even attempt to hit the brakes. I remember my coworker screaming “do good, do good, do good” I aimed the car at a small spot between the front of one semi and the back of the other as they crossed and hit that small gap at about 95mph. To this day I don’t know how the car fit. Both side mirrors weren’t just knocked off, they exploded off the side of the car by hitting the two rigs and there was a gash down both sides of the car that looked like racing stripes put in with a chisel.  We came to a stop a hundred feet or so past the trucks where both drivers were already out of their rigs and super emotional. One guy said there was no way we were alive right now because he saw us fly through and knew we didn’t have enough space. My coworker was openly crying as he called his wife and then hugged me (we didn’t have that type of relationship) and said he didn’t know how I didn’t it, but he’s alive because I made it through that small sliver. \n\nTo this day, I don’t know how I did it, but know for a fact, that if I had not taken those keys at the gas station my coworker would have not made it through the trucks and we’d be two more statistics in Highway deaths. \n\nWhen people say the choices they make have no bearing on anything, I know 100% they are full of shit. I’m living proof. And too Matt Breske, wherever you are- hope that Park Ave lasted you a long time and you treated her right.",

I could STILL be in a prison in Nevada if the legal proceeding had broken against me.\n\n2) Seven years later, I was on a bender in Vegas again (I'm not a raging drug addict or anything, these are the two most egregious drug moments of my life), coked to the gills, and in the middle of the second day of a blackout (apparently) I decided I HAD to drive back to LA right that moment. So I (apparently) went, got my car from the valet, successfully drove over 150 miles to Barstow, CA, and then crashed my car into the back of a semi truck at 60+ on the highway. This is when my memory comes back online. I flipped the car 5 times and came to rest on the roof in the median--and somehow walked away without a scratch.\n\nThat same month that happened, a guy I went to high school with was driving drunk in our hometown, also got in an accident, and killed a girl we were to high school with. He got a mandatory minimum, did 8 years, and came out a completely different person, and not for the better.\n\nI think about those two incidents at least a few times a week, even all these years later. Any time I start to complain, I just think how lucky I am to have dodged these two nukes, and I say something grateful instead.",

That company was Radio Shack 🙂.",

I looked around and my mom's head, hand, and foot were bleeding. I still had a breadstick in my hand.

She was 6 months pregnant with my little brother.(he came out ok) I had hit the dashboard hard enough to cause cataracts in my eyes to develop as well.(an airbag would've killed me) The 2 carseats in the back cracked in half and our doors were jammed. I believe a passerby with grey hair came and said it'll be alright and that the people were on their way. I blinked and next thing I know I'm on an ambulance with my mom. I'm sitting in the corner while she's on a stretcher(sorry getting a bit teared up) I was asking for my step dad but he wasn't there so a paramedic was acting like him to calm me. Well I passed out. I wake up later on a stretcher. They're talking to my mom saying ima need eye surgery. I passed out soon as he said it. Next thing I know, I blink and I wake up with an eye patch on one of my eyes(I had gotten 2 eye surgeries). I can see 20/20 and am living a good life. My mom till this day, won't tell me who hit us.

He expected me to leave my son at home with my dad every night and go stay with him till just before my son left to school and drop my son to school just to come back to his house and stay with him. After one night I finally decided I was going to leave or at least attempt to get some advice and I went to my uncles house the next morning after talking to my uncle and he told me that I needed to stay away from my ex and never go back there again because it was dangerous. As I was leaving his neighborhood I heard car tires and before I knew it he had me blocked off on a main street in our city and demanded I get out of my car right there. I got around him but he followed me another mile and made me pull over after he pulled me over he wanted me to again leave my car I convinced him to just let me take my car home since I was less than a mile away and I would go with him when I took my car home . After I took my car home and got in his car he was just yelling how I was ungrateful about not wanting to spend all my time with someone who loves me and cares for me. After that he decided we needed to take a family trip up north with my son and him. I agreed and told him I would go get my son and get in my car to go to his house. We get there and he's upset about something instantly and I try to keep as calm as possible and thats when my son told me he wanted to go home and that he was scared, I knew I had to leave and never come back at that point. My son was only 7 and I told him to go sit in the car since my ex wouldn't be able to see him going out there. When I told my ex we were leaving I didn't give him a chance to talk to me or pull me back I just went straight to my car and never looked back. This is one of my greatest regrets as a parent exposing my son to this experience and I punish myself internally for this I can't believe I did this to my son. It's been 5 years almost 6 since that day and I can say I dodged this tactical nuke after about a year I found out he was the one responsible for his son's mother's death (getting her addicted to pills after he burnt her with hot cooking oil which resulted in her addiction and overdose). Last I heard he's an addict living out of state. (I was happy to find out he was living out of state since I was always terrified I'd run into him since we had lived very close at the time)\nI can gladly say now my son has someone who is there for him in the most positive way I could imagine and we are safe.

            "text": "Going back to school\nA few months before Covid my friend group got into a big fight. The group consisted of a lot of people who were popular in my school so everyone was sort of friends of friends there. I just happened to keep talking with the same friends I knew from primary/elementary so I was with them a lot, but I wasn’t a social person so it was being around so many people I didn’t know was awkward for me. My friends’ arguments got increasingly bad and a fight was about to go down. This was over text so it wasn’t immediate but I stepped in and started talking about how the conflict was pointless and how one of our friends was being a fake one in every aspect. This provoked him and so he and I got into a fight that happened shortly after. He said it would be one on one and a few of my friends said they’d come to help just in case. They didn’t, and the friend I was about to fight brought a couple other people. I let him throw the first punch and then just got him on his knees with a headlock. I didn’t want to hurt him because I was bigger and he was sort of my buddy at the time. Then, one of the people he brought in repeatedly elbowed me in the back of the head before I could do anything I got a nasty concussion. I backed off and then they threatened to just make it 3 on 1 so I had to leave, after all the guy who elbowed me was twice my size. After that, we tried to talk things out but it didn’t work and the rest of my friend group just laughed at me about it, mocking me for putting him in a headlock instead of just throwing fists. This is where I started to break off from my friend group. The concussion was seriously impairing me and I couldn’t do much besides rest at home, and in the meanwhile the friend I fought started talking all about the fight at school and people in my friend group got upset at me for fighting him. I’m not sure how the whole social gimmick worked so I can’t really explain their reactions but tldr they were all upset and some even threatened me. This was all in November 2019- now fast forward to January 2020. I’m only talking with a select few people from my friend group now but they’ve been progressively treating me worse. I think they shared feelings with my now-ex friends so they just started to show it more and more overtime. My concussion was starting to wear off and I was slowly starting to go to school more and more. At this point though I had almost no friends and a LOT of anxiety every time I went to school. People were constantly questioning and occasionally throwing threats or rude comments at me despite school staff intervention. Then in March, Covid started and I didn’t have to go to school. I haven’t had to since and I’ve been doing great in online school. Since the concussion and losing my friend group I’ve moved on and met a lot of new people and grown in many ways. I still have a crippling anxiety when I’m remotely near the school but if I was forced to go back in person my life would have been certainly worse. I tried reconnecting with my old friends twice over the pandemic and they haven’t changed at all, so things didn’t work out. In the end, that just goes to show that going back would have only made things much worse. \n\nI would elaborate on how it helped me out but that’d include sharing a lot more personal information that is outside of my comfort zone. \n\nAnyway, thanks if you read this",

            "text": "This has to do with my newborn baby. I had a very easy labor and delivery at 37 weeks exactly, we were released exactly 24 hours later and everything was going great. Baby was a little jaundiced, but they told me it was fine. Over the next two days she grew extremely Orange and I called her pediatrician multiple times and they kept putting me off as we were supposed to go in that Friday for her well-visit. On Wednesday morning (she was born Sunday) I was just really freaked out and everyone thought I was overreacting. We’d had 6 previous losses so my parents, husband, friends, and doctor thought I was just hyper vigilant, but I said I thought something was really wrong and called our pediatrician’s office the minute they opened. Once again, they tried to make me wait til Friday. I begged them to see her and that [Wednesday] afternoon, she had blood work done that showed her bilirubin levels were 17 (normal is 5-9) and they asked me to bring her in the next morning for another blood draw. By then, she seemed worse. After the morning blood draw, she just wouldn’t nurse and would barely wake up and I was really nervous, then they called us at 2PM saying her levels were 24 from the morning blood draw and we needed to take her to the pediatric hospital immediately and the nicu would be expecting us. By the time we got to the NICU her bili levels were 27. At 25, bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier and can cause permanent damage like developmental delays, hearing loss, and cerebral palsy. It was a really scary ordeal, but within 4 days she was released after receiving light treatment and two exchange transfusions. She recently passed her hearing test 2 months out, and we’re hopeful any negative effects were reversed! \n\nI write this to tell people to TRUST YOUR GUT. I just knew something was wrong and literally everyone around me blew me off and acted like I was just paranoid and traumatized by loss. If I’d waited for that Friday appointment, she would have absolutely had permanent brain damage from the rapid rise she was experiencing. Her pediatrician and the NICU team at the children’s hospital were really surprised that she was in that condition that quickly. Having a child with long term neurological damage isn’t the end of the world and I know many people who have been dealt that hand, but I probably wouldn’t have been able to forgive myself or those around me if that hadn’t been caught at exactly the last redeeming hour.",

My friends mom murdered him with sleeping pills and then leaving him to unconsciously inhale car fumes. She also tried to kill his older brother and herself but failed. If not for my mom thinking that lady was a whackjob, I'd probably be dead.\n\nI was once shipwrecked in a storm in the open ocean off the coast of mexico. If not for a ham radio, I'd probably be dead.\n\nThanksgiving night 2019 I noticed my leg was swollen, red, and really hot to the touch. I chalked it up to water retention from salty food. My anxiety was eating me alive about it when I noticed it was even worse in the morning. Went to a CVS clinic. Waited for hours. Some people waiting there told me to run because they'd been there even longer than I. I almost gave up, but decided to give an urgent care a shot. Couldn't roll up my jeans to show the doctor it was so swollen. They did a quick blood test and said \"get your fucking ass to the ER. You have a serious infection and your white blood cell count is sky high.\" I went to the ER. Spent four days in the hospital on a vancomycin drip. Doctor came in, told me I had staph and it was likely MRSA, and cut me loose with a bactrim script. If not for my severe anxiety disorder I would have ignored it, let it spread, gotten a fever, and then maybe I'd eventually go into sepsis or some shit. And then at that point I'd probably be dead.\n\nI stopped seeing my college casual sex partner after she described to me in very particular detail how she was having visions of our future life and children. She's a nut and ended up marrying a dude that looks like me. Nothing too crazy here but I found out she was cheating on her boyfriend with me. Which in my experience usually means she'd end up cheating on me and I'd find out after we were married with kids because I'm oblivious. And then back then I think I would drink as much as I can physically contain in my body until I can no longer lift a glass, and then I'd probably be dead.\n\n:)",

I had purchased an engagement ring, planned out a romantic date in the mountains, and set the day. Her favorite holiday was Halloween, so that was the day I chose. \n\nMy proposal was coming up quick, and I was giddy. It was maybe three weeks away. I couldn't believe that I was going to be with the woman of my dreams, my happily ever after... Until I was warned about a mutual friend of ours. I was told that my now-ex was sleeping with him behind my back, and I didn't believe it. A little less than two weeks from the big day, I found out the truth. God did it break my heart, shattered it even. \n\nI was at work when she came by to drop off my debit card, one that I wanted her to borrow so she could treat herself to her favorite restaurant. The place was a bit pricey, but I thought she deserved it, she was my muse after all. She came into my workplace, and I asked how she got there, because I was a little suspicious. She told me a BS story about how her lady friend was driving her around, one that I knew real well. Since I didn't quite buy it, call it intuition, I followed her out. She pretty much took off running, legging it back to the car she was in. Much to my surprise, she wasn't with a woman, but a fat tub of shit man who drove a white Crown Vic. I called her right after they took off, and she told me everything. She told me that she was sleeping with that man for four months, and it started of my birthday. She said she didn't love me anymore, that she never really did from the start. She apologized to me by hanging up the phone.\n\nSome time later, I found out she had been sleeping with my friends, needless to say they aren't in my life anymore. I also found out why my other friends quit talking to me, she had told them that I was an abusive wife-beater. That I was violent, and that I touched children.\n\nI was left homeless after, and I lived in a shed during a cold Midwestern winter. (And I loved it) \n\nTL;DR: My ex was a cheating bitch who tried ruining my life and almost did.",

Along this road they have to place huge concrete culverts which allow any water to pass under the road, they then tarmac over the top of them.

Anyway I had to test the ground of one particular location, quite low down. So I I'm about 20 feet below the normal ground level, and above me on an old section of road is a 60 tonne digger which is going to dump some stone onto the ground and then place the culvert once I'm done. I'm standing in a hole recording results, looking down when all of a sudden I hear men screaming at the top of their lungs. I look up from the bottom of this hole to see the arm of the digger and a bucket full of huge stones (around 6 tonnes worth) directly above me. The digger driver thought I was gone and was seconds away from turning me into a fine paste. I climbed out of the hole and seen two engineers nearby white as ghosts.

            "text": "Late to the party, but oh well. This is from back in the early 2000’s. \n\nI had been dating my girlfriend for 7 years. We started in high school, and then moved in together after I finished college. Everything began to turn at that point. She couldn’t hold a job, wasn’t planning on going to college, and was generally burning through what little money we had every month. I was looking for a way out of the relationship, but felt trapped due to bills, and that general sense of being afraid of change. I would lay in bed at night trying to come up with the courage to just break up and move on, but I knew I couldn’t afford our apartment on my own - what little she did make would cover the little bit that I couldn’t do on my own. My bank account was regularly overdrawn to buy groceries, and I was skipping bills in order to survive. I was not in a good place mentally or financially. We argued all the time. Little things here and there. Petty things. She was fond of throwing things at me, banging her head into doors or walls, all while screaming at the top of her lungs. Eventually things came to a head when I was woken up one night by the police knocking on our door. They showed up and said they were responding to a domestic disturbance. I figured one of the neighbors heard her having a tantrum and called. I was mortified. Unfortunately the police made the general assumption that I had beaten her, which couldn’t be farther from the truth. They checked us both for markings and found nothing, however I was still hauled off to jail. In my pajamas. Barefoot. She never once attempted to tell them that I had not touched her, which was the biggest betrayal I have ever felt. Her own mother came to the police station and told them her daughter was being a stupid cunt, and that if she had any suspicion that I had laid a hand on her daughter that I deserved to be in jail, but that she’s knows I did not. She was my saving grace. They released me the next morning and no charges were filed against me. The county prosecutor’s office did, however, inform me they would be filing false reporting charges against her. Turns out she had called the police, set her phone down so they could hear, and then put on her best performance (she had always been a fan of going from 0 to 100 in an argument). At this point I was through with her and I packed my things and moved out. Later that year I began dating someone who is now my wife. My ex ended up with one of my friends, who I obviously don’t speak to anymore. To my knowledge she is now a smoker, still hasn’t gone to school, still isn’t making any money, and has still not really made it in society. \n\nMy wife and I both have high paying careers, own a home on some acreage, living debt free, traveling all over the world, and are enjoying every second of it.",

            "text": "Almost exactly 3 years ago. It was a sunny fall Saturday morning and I'm (32M) sitting on the couch reading a huge stack of new library books to my 2 year old daughter. I'm in the middle of the couch, with the stack of books to my left and my daughter on my right side. We finish a book and she climbs over my lap to pick out the next book off the stack, and in the process, she knees me right in the balls. I immediately feel the familiar feeling of \"ouch I hurt my balls,\" felt a little queasy, tears in my eyes, hard to breathe for a second. The feeling goes away after a few minutes, back to reading, continue on with the weekend. By Monday, I notice my left ball is swollen, which is unusual, but not unexpected given that it got fully knelt on by a pointy kid knee. So, I keep an eye on it for a few days and don't think much about it. After a week, the swelling is still there and it's still sore, so I call my primary doctor to get an appointment. Of course he was booked up for 3 weeks, so I schedule it and wait it out, figuring it'll probably heal by the time I get there.\n\nThree weeks later, swelling and soreness still present, I go to my doctor's appointment. He looks me over, orders an ultrasound for the following week, and tells me it's probably a hematoma (basically like a coagulated bruise that can take a while for your body to absorb). Get the ultrasound, results look like a hematoma, so he says come back in a month if it's still there. A month goes by, still exactly the same, so I go back. He looks me over, says he thinks I might have improved slightly, and it still looks like a really persistent hematoma. Tells me to keep an eye on it for a couple more weeks and come back again if it's still there. That night, I get terrible chills and feel super nauseous. Start feeling like I have a fever and it hurts when I pee. I end up going to urgent care, and they tell me I have a urinary tract infection (very rare in men). So, I get some antibiotics and call my doctor the next day. He orders an MRI and refers me to a urologist, just to be safe.\n\nBy now, it's December. I get in with the urologist a few days later, and because it's a university hospital, he has a \"fellow\" (student doctor) with him. The fellow meets with me first and tells me that the MRI looks exactly like a hematoma and sometimes they can take up to 6 months to go away. So, I'm a little annoyed that this thing is taking so long to go away, but overall, not super bothered by this whole thing, and I'm ready to get out of there, as my wife and I have a cabin rented way out in the woods for a weekend hiking trip right before the Christmas holiday. The urologist comes in and basically agrees with the fellow. Says it looks like a hematoma, and just give it time. I thank him, and as I'm on the way out, he asks me if my primary doc ever ordered any bloodwork for me. I said no, so he says he wants to order some, and to stop by the lab on my way out. So, I do that, and my wife and I head home to start packing for our long weekend getaway.\n\nThe next day, the car is packed and we get ready to leave on our \"unplugged\" trip where we know there will be very limited cell service and no internet. I'm readying the last few things, and my wife starts violently throwing up pretty much out of nowhere. So, I contact the airbnb guy, ask him if we can postpone our arrival by a day. He agrees. I go on a hike near my house while my wife rests. Unrelated to overall story, but I see a freaking MOUNTAIN LION while hiking (first time I've ever seen one and pretty rare in Missouri). We wake up the next day, wife is feeling better, so we head out on our trip. We get about 2 hours away from home and stop for lunch. I get a call from the doctor and my bloodwork showed extremely elevated levels of three different \"tumor markers\" which can be indicators of testicular cancer, and he wants to perform surgery on me right away to remove one of my balls. He says he is getting ready to leave the country for 3 weeks because of the upcoming holiday, but he would be willing to do it tomorrow. So, at this point I'm obviously freaking out. Mad that my vacation is basically ruined no matter what I do, and just overall  irritated to have been dealing with this for so long, and very freaked out that I'll be losing one of the boys. So, ultimately we decide to turn around and drive 2 hours back home to have the surgery the next day (longest drive I've ever driven just to eat a Jimmy John's sandwich). Do the surgery, it goes fine. They do a biopsy, but because it's right before Christmas, I have to wait like a week to get results. Finally get a call as I'm heading to a work meeting, and it's definitely cancer. So, one full meltdown later, and I'm getting scheduled for 9 weeks of intense chemo. Luckily, testicular cancer can be cured if they blast the hell out of you with chemo, so I do that. 3 years later, chemo complete and a couple additional surgeries later, I appear to be cancer free. My doctor says that I likely had testicular cancer before my daughter kneed me, probably for up to a year, and didn't even know it.  Now that I'm \"all clear,\" every year that I stay all clear it, becomes more likely that I will stay that way for the long term. If I can make it to 10 years all clear, I will be considered \"cured.\"\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Had my daughter not kneed me in the balls, I ultimately probably wouldn't have found out that I had testicular cancer for quite a while, potentially putting me in a much worse state.\n2. Had I not gotten a urinary tract infection (still no idea why. As far as anyone can tell, they are not a sign or symptom commonly associated with testicular cancer), I would not have been referred to the urologist when I was.\n3. Had the urologist not stopped me on the way out the door and decided last minute to order blood work, we likely would have just kept waiting it out to see if it went away, and letting it spread further.\n4. Had my wife not gotten violently sick literally out of nowhere (possible thanks to Arby's for the food poisoning, but we don't know for sure), we would have gone on our trip the day we planned, and I would have been hiking in an area with no cell service and would have missed the call from my doctor that the tumor markers were elevated. Also wouldn't have seen that mountain lion, which, wtf. My doc would have then left the country for 3 weeks, which would have delayed the surgery by a month, again potentially allowing the cancer to spread even further.\n\nAnyway. Still here. Doing ok. Guys, check your balls in the shower for lumps, especially young guys, as testicular cancer is most common to happen when you're in your 20s and early 30s.",

My mum grabbed us kids and we started to pray he was safe.

A tornado outbreak hit the DFW metroplex, which happened to be where my sister and I lived. My sister had spent Christmas with her husband and I had flown to Denver to spend it with my parents. \n\nOriginally we were going to drive down to Texas a few days after Christmas, not the day after, but a blizzard was coming and my dad knew if we didn’t leave right away we’d not be going anywhere, and who knows when I’d make it back to Dallas.\n\nSo we start driving and somehow got ahead of the blizzard, but the wind on the plains was all but trying to blow us off the road, so we had to drive slow AF.

This should have been a red flag but I was like « it’s alright, I know this place better than my pocket, nothing bad will happen ».  I got up in the mountains, skied for a bit when I noticed it was getting even more foggy, at that moment i honestly couldn’t tell apart the slope from the off-slope. So I decided to ski down a bit to reach the ski lift and wait for the fog to maybe fade away. But when skiing down, at a moment, I had the impression that I couldn’t move my skis, so i looked down and was horrified to see that it was no longer my skis moving on the snow, but the snow moving under my skis. \nSo what happened ? \nWell 2-3 minutes after I began skiing down, there was a pretty big avalanche right were i was, and the snow running down the hill caught up with me and just swept me along for 15secondes before stopping. \nIn the end I just got scared and made it to the safety post to inform them to close the slopes, but if I had stayed up there 2-3 minutes more, i probably would not be writing this, now i don’t ski when it’s too foggy",

He asked them for directions to a main road that lead to the dorms, which they found weird because virtually everyone at the bar attended UF and were familiar with the area.

It was inside a sunglasses case along with a little pipe. \n\nI dropped my bag off at the bus station and was going to have one last toke before ditching the weed.  It was a 24 hour bus ride after all. Before I could leave the station I was surrounded by 4 cops who asked me to come with them.  I thought about throwing the case in the trash as they led me away but it didn’t seem like I could pull it off. \n\nThey sat me down on a bench and told me to wait till the captain was ready to see me. I know I’ve got to ditch this weed or I’m fucked. The door to the station swings inward and is held open by a door jam leaving like a 4 inch crack between the wall and the door. I’m thinking if I can throw the case between the wall and the door they won’t find it till I’m gone. Luckily this is a South American police station and not the US so there are no cameras and the other cops are watching a game show on tv while we are waiting for the captain to finish searching some other guy for drugs.  \n\nI look around and the coast seems clear. I take the case out of my pocket and toss the case five feet or so from the bench I’m sitting on into the little crack behind the door.  It makes what sound to me like a deafening thud but nobody else notices.  \n\nI finally get to see the captain who search me very thoroughly, even looking at the photos on my camera. With nothing on my person to find they let me go. The next 18 or so hours until I was out of the country were quite nerve wracking as we kept coming up to military checkpoints and I was expecting them to be waiting for me on account of the cops finding the case.

She came up to my room to check on me, at first she didn’t notice anything wrong and left, but it took me so much energy to just talk and say that I was in so much pain.\n\nShe initially thought it was just gas in my stomach and she got some remedy to try to ease it, but it didn’t do anything. I needed to go to the bathroom badly and she had to carry me there. After I used it, I was so dizzy that even with her help, I hit my forehead on the door. She then told me if I wanted to go to the hospital but I brushed it off and said it was no big deal. She called my sister and told her about what happened and she said that it was probably serious, and that I should be taken to the hospital. I eventually caved in and we went there.\n\nI got tests done, and it turned out that I had appendicitis. The surgeons came in my room and they suggested that I either get surgery to get my appendix removed or that I take antibiotics. I didn’t want to go through that hell ever again so I picked surgery. \n\nIf I wasn’t convinced to go to the hospital, I am pretty sure that I would be dead. Appendicitis is one fucking terrifying and dangerous disease.\n\n\nTLDR: Had a painful “stomachache” and I thought nothing about it until I got convinced to go to the hospital. And turns out, this “stomachache” was appendicitis.",

I started to feel pain in my abdomen but I never thought it was bad enough to need to see a doctor.\n\nOne day, I felt extremely fatigued and kinda just overall unwell. I skipped all my morning classes which was way abnormal for me. My roommate looked at me and said I should go to the school nurse and make sure it isn’t anything more serious than just food. She seemed rather concerned so I was talked into going to help ease her worry. Nurse basically said pain in the abdomen is something to be seen about in the ER and the. security drove me there immediately. \n\nIn the ER, I was expecting to be told, to my embarrassment, that I just had bad gas, a sensitive stomach or some sort of constipation. However after the doctor ran blood tests, pushed on my abdomen and heard my symptoms, he surprised me and said I needed surgery. He said I’d need surgery no matter what so no reason to expose me to the radiation from a CT. He thought I most likely had appendicitis so that’s what I thought I was getting surgery for when being put to sleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, I felt pain like I never have before and  actually begged the nurse to be put back sleep. I was informed my large intestine had perforated causing leakage into my abdominal cavity. I also had a large abscess and a bunch of deep ulcers in my small and large intestines. I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and was in the early stages of sepsis as well. The surgeon had to remove parts of my small and large bowel and completely empty and thoroughly clean my abdominal cavity. I later learned he had actually told my mom, I would have died in the next 12-24 hours had I not had the surgery. I have no permanent serious damage to my organs due to the sepsis. \n\nI was especially lucky that a amazing trauma surgeon from a big medical school associated hospital was spending a couple months working in that small town hospital.

He was stationed on a base in Saigon in the  depths of the Vietnam war. Fortunately, he didn't have to do much fighting, as his job was for helicopter and base security, moving people from place to place, and helping keep the aircraft in the air. \n\nOne day though, his CO came to him and informed him and his buddies that the mayor of Saigon was throwing a dinner party, and the US military needed to have representation there. The normal officers who would go were either on a mission or were out of country on R&R. Since nobody else down the chain had much interest in attending this shindig, my dad and friends were volentold for the job. \n\nThey got dressed in their uniforms, and headed out into the evening. Since their uniform strictly forbade the use of a visible sidearm, as they walked down the twilight roads, my dad walked between his two buddies, carrying a literal duffel bag full of weapons and ammunition. \n\nThey got to the mayor's house, were very quiet and polite, said what pleasantries they had been ordered to say, and then just sat down in a side room to sip drinks and wait out the evening. \n\nThey noticed a South Vietnamese general walk into the room. Upon spotting the three GIs, the general pulled out his sidearm, racked a round and began pointing it my dad and his buddies while screaming at the top of his lungs in Vietnamese. \n\nThey (\"very calmly\" in my dad's bone-dead dry humorous way of putting it) asked the interpreter sitting next to them why the general was pointing his live sidearm at them. The interpreter then \"very calmly\" said that the general had just come back from a disastrous mission, where apparently the CIA had given him bad intel, which ended with his entire battalion getting wiped out. \"The interpreter seemed quite unworried\" as he told them that the general was going to kill the three Americans to send a message to the CIA: nobody gives this general bad intel and gets away with it.\n\nThroughout all this exchange, my dad had casually let his hand drop down to the duffel bag which was almost entirely obscured from the general's view. My dad wrapped his hand around a 1911, as he decided which of his friends he was going to let die. The general had good firearms discipline, and each time he swept the men, there was only a couple split seconds when the pistol wasn't pointed directly at one of their heads. My dad knew his sidearm didn't have a round racked into the chamber, so he was going to have to pull up the gun, rack it back, and fire. He knew that wherever the general was pointing, that person would die. Then it was just a question who was quicker - the general bringing it to bear on my dad, or my dad getting a round into the chamber and then into the general. \n\nHe said it felt like an eternity, when in reality it may have only been a couple seconds.\n\nAll of a sudden, the mayor of Saigon rushed into the room, and starting also screaming in Vietnamese, but this time at the general.

My sister and I were walking home from playing at the park or the elementary school can’t really remember which one. Either way it was afternoon maybe 1/2. And it was the middle of summer so wouldn’t be weird for kids to be out. Anyways as we were walking home we noticed a car drive past us, no big deal happens all the time, then we notice it pull into a driveway and go back down the road passing us again. Still I wasn’t thinking anything big about it. Then we hear it turn around again and start to slowly drive behind us, creeping slower and slower towards us. My sister starts to get panicked, she doesn’t hide her panic or anxiety well. She pretty much grabs me like she is giving me a side hug and says we need to run. I start to get scared, then she pushes me and we take off. We manage to cut through to a small back alley behind some houses that only people that live in the neighborhood really use; some use it to park but not a lot of people do. Anyways as we take off we hear the car engine revving up and we hear it take a turn and try to find the back alley we were in. Again my sister says we still need to run and says we have to jump a fence. Now I’m tiny, and I’m still not very big, but she grabs me and helps me try to jump the fence. It wasn’t happening. So we bolted and ran to the closest backyard gate we could find and slam it closed hoping if he spotted us he wouldn’t be able to see where we went since all the gates are closed. We run into the yard, and a couple was sitting outside. We run up to them, I can’t explain what is happening cause I don’t really understand what is really happening and I was starting to cry. My sister manages to tell them what happened and the old man ran to the front yard and tried to see the car. Don’t remember if he did or not but we stayed at their house for a couple of minutes then we ask them to help get us home. We aren’t far away from home, and they walk us. Needless to say that my parents were hysterical, and didn’t let us wander far for a very long time. \n\nNot sure what would’ve happened but either way I just thank my sister she acted quick and got us the hell out of whatever terrible situation we could’ve ended up in.",

The guy had brought some vegetables for what reason from the fields, and wanted help biking them back home. I offered to help. He suggested we rent a movie and get pizza, I said why not. At the video club, the guy working there was well acquainted with me. While Mario went to the bathroom, he took 7 seconds to tell me Mario is bad news and I need GTFO and leave him be. I'm like ok, I gave my word for help so I won't go back on that. I ended up biking to his home, ordered the pizza, played some street badminton with his neighbors who were closer to my age, started watching a movie and 15 minutes in I say I got to go to my ma to help. At some point he said he had work I could do for some money for him, but I refused. He laments my departure a bit, but he was cool to let me go. I biked home no problem. I later learn from video club friend the guy is allegedly a pyromaniac who burned his mom's house over some money dispute. Yikes. But the worst part is this.\n\nOne year later, I do the cucumber job again, make new friends. A teen 2 years younger says his friend Alexandre Livernoche has been missing. He's sure a guy named Mario Bastien (I didn't remember the guys name right then) has him because he had offered the kid to do some work on the weekends. He's doing grand talk of breaking in Mario's house and figure it out.\n\n5 days later, big news of Alex Livernoche who got murdered by knife stabbing, in the woods so near my home.

We had a pregnancy scare very soon into our relationship that turned out to be nothing. But she had a kid from a previous relationship and had told me she had all the same feeling as before. We had already started picking out stuff for this new baby when we found out that she wasn’t pregnant. She straight up looks at me and says we should just try to have a baby now.\n\nTo paint the picture, this had already been a rocky relationship. She had broken up with me less than a month before and we were kind of back together and kind of not. We had barely been together like half a year total including breaks. She was 7 years older than I was and getting close to that “gotta have a baby now” stage but still had some years. \n\nI told her no, this wasn’t a good idea and she never really forgave me for that. We stayed together for another year and a half and it was a terribly toxic relationship.\n\nLater I broke up with her and She immediately found a New man and did everything she could to make me jealous. Shit like that doesn’t work on me, however it was frustrating because I was the most dad her kid had so I was still in their lives for the kiddos sake. If I could I would have had zero contact with her but she would use her kid to essentially make me talk to her. Anyways fast forward a year and she is pregnant by this New guy and found out while they were broken up.\n\nHere is the deal though. She was on the pill when she got pregnant and swears she never missed a day. Iono if y’all have checked but its pretty close to impossible to get pregnant while taking the pill correctly. I later found out from her close friend (after they had a falling out) that her new man had been trying to break up with her then BOOM suddenly she is pregnant and now they have to stay together. I learned a lot of shit from this friend like the lies she had been telling to everybody. I never knew how much of a liar my ex was and she lied about everything even to the extent of telling people that she had broken up with me (100% not true)\n\nY’all, I’m fairly certain she trapped this man with a baby. And that could have been me. My sister is still friends with my ex recently went to see this new baby and messaged me “this man could have totally been you. You dodged a bullet” true story. \n\nIt’s only in retrospect that I can see that she was trying to do the same to me. I just never allowed her the opportunity after we had that pregnancy scare to even have a chance of her getting pregnant. \n\nThere is so much more to this story that’s too hard to cram into a Reddit post but for real guys, I dodged a baby nuke.",

We matched the truck’s speed at about 50 mph, and then out of nowhere the truck proceeds to switch lanes. I was sitting in the passengers seat and the left front wheel of the truck was almost directly in front of me. It felt like time stopped. My friend somehow instinctually floored it and maneuvered half onto the island and flew past the truck. The driver obviously did not check his mirrors before switching lanes and came close to killing us, because there’s no other way that scenario could have played out.\n\nAlso, it amazed me that my friend floored the gas instead of slamming the brakes. Because if she had slammed the brakes, which is what I would have done if I was driving, the trucker would have never realized we were there and would have continued to switch lanes. I’m almost certain the back end of the truck would have taken us out because our car wouldn’t have been able to slow down in time to give the truck enough space to lane change.

They were horrific as a teenager, and right after college, I had a spell where things were constantly painful, and clearly something was wrong.  I wind up going to five OB-GYNs for help.  None examined me.  Most tried to well me on a weight loss program.  Two didn't even let me into the exam room, just talked to me in their office.\n\nMy GP came through and helped me, and for a while, it eased up a bit. \n Then in my early 30's, I cramps them so bad I wound up in the ER.  The diagnosis was pretty much, \"Really bad cramps.  Maybe endometriosis.\"  Yes, cramps so bad they thought I was in labor, that's all it was, me being hysterical.\n\nFast forward a few years.  I end up in the ER again.  They help me with the pain, send me to an OB-GYN.  She's nice, we schedule an exam (I had to be put under for it), everything goes well, she says, yes, endometriosis.  We'll put you on the pill.\n\nThe pill instantly gives me a HUGE blood clot.  It does not break loose, thank god, and we successfully treat it.  (Nuke #1 dodged.)\n\nI ask about a hysterectomy, but am told it's not a real option for me.  I don't remember why, but probably because I was in my 30's and hadn't had kids yet.  (Nor would I ever; I didn't want them.)  So we just cruise along into my 40s, and I get told, \"It's just endometriosis, it'll end when you hit menopause.\"\n\nFast forward a few more years, and I start having some small issues holding my bladder.  Then it gets more pronounced.  I'm convinced it's because I was fat, and if modern medicine  has taught me anything, it's that fat people do it to themselves and just have to live with it...  So I just live with it.  \n\nThen one day I stand up, and, well, I can't live with it anymore.\n\nI schedule an appointment.  I'm assured there's options.  Doc sends me to new OB-GYN to get that cleared before we do options.\n\nOB-GYN hears what I'm saying, listens to my history, and instantly goes into red alert mode.  She has me in imaging within a couple of days.  I was full of fibroids in and around my uterus.  The largest was softball size or better.  That's what had been causing the incontinence (and a hernia)--the weight of the fibroids, especially that one.\n\nShe schedules me for an immediate biopsy.\n\nI have cancer.\n\nA few weeks later, a few days after Thanksgiving, I'm cut open and carved out like a jack-o-lantern.  Uterus, tubes, ovaries, a lymph node, cervix, and the fibroids.  \n\nAll but one of the tumors are benign.  It was inside my uterus, was the size of a baby's fist isn't, and had angrily gnawed halfway into my uterine wall.  But, thank goodness, it was still self contained, making it Stage One, despite the amount and size of the tumors.  If I'd waited until the new year, or if that doctor hadn't gone into red alert mode, my story might not be the same.\n\nI wish I could remember that doctor's name, the one that went into red alert mode.  I want to send her a note and tell her thank you, for taking me and my symptoms more seriously than any doctor ever has.  (I still see one of my post-surgery nurses periodically.

I used my emergency radio to call EOD (Bomb Squad) who confirmed that it was live, and miraculous that I didn't set it off. They then sent us away and blew it up in place. Oh, and I was missed by a falling tree by 2 feet a couple minutes before stepping on the bomb. Luckily I still found all my points because I was not going back out there.",

In my early 20’s I had been diagnosed with PCOS and endometriosis/adenomyosis and everything uterus related was eventually blamed back on those 3 things. In July of 2016 our workplace insurance decided to give us all a $25 a month discount if we completed a yearly physical. This is the first time they’d offered it and I wanted to blow it off but maaaan, a broke bitch gotta. 10 minutes into the exam and the doctor is pressing on my abdomen and says “does this hurt?” It ALWAYS hurt, that’s endo. Turns out I had a softball sized tumor enclosing my left ovary, pressing against my kidney, and a uterus that was basically 95% cancer. They found patches up along my stomach (but not ON my stomach, thank fuck) on the fatty lining. But here’s the thing, I had had an ultrasound in February in which my left ovary was noted as located and normal. That tumor grew to the size of a softball in less than 5 months. I never noticed anything outside of my ordinary. Another 3 months and I’d have been dead. I was on the table for a full hysterectomy just 10 days after that first appointment. My oncologist is still in awe that I am doing so well. I’ve been cancer free since February 2017. NED they call it, no evidence of disease.

I was with my ex wife at the time and it was really late at night when we started our drive. I was exhausted and my ex wife was just awesome as she always was. \n\nIf anyone has driven in Montana, there are no lights in between the towns. At night, it is DARK outside. We were already on the road for about 45 minutes and I had not changed lanes, taken an exit, nothing. Just a straight road all the way up as we did on the way down.  \n\n\nAfter while, I noticed a sign facing the opposite direction and my ex wife noticed that I noticed that too. She said, \"I think you should be in the other lane\". At first I was like, \"but then I would be on the opposite side of the road, right? Wouldn't that be oncoming traffic?\"  \n\n\nWe continued driving for about 5 minutes and then I switch lanes, listening to my ex wife, and out of nowhere, this vehicle comes ROARING past us probably going about 100 mph easily in the opposite direction. We just BARELY smashed head on with this person.  \n\n\nWe immidiately pulled over into a safe spot and looked at each other like, \"DID THAT JUST HAPPEN??? HOW??? WE WERE IN THE CORRECT LANE THE WHOLE TIME!!!\"  \n\n\nTo this day, I have no clue why that stretch of road was the way it was, how we ended up on the wrong side even though we were in the right lane and the left lane was opposite traffic. I have no clue how my ex wife had a hunch to switch lanes and the overall vibe but she saved our lives that day for sure.  \n\n\nThose Montana roads can get confusing sometimes and we are from the east coast. We were not used to driving in the country like that.  \n\n\nWe may have divorced but there will always be a special place in my heart for that woman because she saved our lives. She's a nurse now.

I was really good friends with the dealer, so over the course of several years I met all the ppl he knew, both in and out of state. \n\nSince I was still able to find good weed, my friends would ask me to get them weed whenever I got some. So here I am, not a drug dealer, taking the same risk as being a dealer, but without any reward. So I started buying in larger quantities and before you know it I’m a dealer. \n\nFor some reason I can’t recall, I decided I needed to buy a pound from a hippie I knew in another state. I drove there picked up the pound and drove back one weekend. It was an ~8 hour drive, so I left early in the morning to avoid having to drive at night, or that was the plan anyways. Left a little later than I planned though. About 2 hours away from home, it gets dark. I drove very carefully and followed the rules of the road to a T. I come to an overpass and see a cop on the downhill side in the median. I was nervous, but knew I wasn’t doing anything wrong, so not that nervous. As I pass, I see his brake lights come on and then he starts moving. I’m more nervous now, thinking surely he isn’t coming for me. Oh but he was. He pulls up behind me and puts the lights on. I’m in pure panic as he pulls me over. He comes to the window and I’m so nervous I can barely answer his questions and my hand is visibly shaking as I hand him my license. He pulled me over bc one of my headlights went out. Had to have burned out that day bc I know it was fine prior to that day. He’s sus of me. Asks me to get out of the car and come with him. My life is flashing before my eyes, thinking I just lost the life I thought I was going to have. I forgot to mention I’d smoked weed in the car an hour beforehand. So we’re sitting in his car and he’s checking my info with the station. Tells me as long as I don’t have any warrants he going to let me off with a warning. Of course I’m all good and he lets me go. Thankfully, the wind was blowing hard from his back and I had both windows down while he was at my window. Otherwise I’d be working at  McDonald’s as a janitor right now. \n\nI pretty much stopped dealing after that. Never been more scared in my life. Thug life isn’t for me…",

Again we thought about it even had the ride attendants trying to convince us to go on but decided we wouldn't and would save the money for after the fireworks display and go on our favorites before getting some candy and going home and two girls got on instead of us.\n\nWe made our way to the crowed as the fire works started and all the rides briefly stopped for the first 10 minutes before starting up again as the rest of the display went on.  Near the end a bunch of cops went pushing and barging through the crowed and came back moments later clearing the way for two paramedics with a stretcher and a girl on it unconscious with a messed up leg and blood over her face and another girl following in tears.\n\nThe next day we found out by a local news update during the display one of the two girls had fallen from the ride after her seat belt failed and un latched as they were coming back down. Her friend held her arm briefly before she slipped but the girls leg got stuck in the bars of the cage just as it was nearing the ground but still to high for anybody yo grab her and save her, the leg she was stuck by slid from the bars and she fell onto the metal floor of the ride blow. \n\nLuckly she didn't die and later on in the weeks it was reported she made a full recovery and was ok except from a broken leg,  cuts and bruises and obviously being shook up from the events.\n\nHonestly it put me off most rides like that for life thinking how close me and my friends were from that being one of us.",

I didn't have a house to stay in so I got a storage unit at the Uhaul location where I got my trailer and just paid for a monthly until I found a place.  When it came time to move my stuff from my Uhaul I parked in the Babies R Us parking lot and used a rented panel van to move my stuff to the house.  The move was easy and I eventually came back and dropped off the van.  I left the storage unit and walked over to the Babies R Us parking lot, got in my Honda and said \"Ok Me, it's time to swing over into the Uhaul lot, grab the last bit of stuff out of the unit and head to the new home.  \n\n\nThat's when I dodged a nuke.  \nI turned left out of the Babies R US Parking lot at about 9:00 PM on Friday night onto a pretty busy street in a city I wasn't too familiar with... into oncoming traffic.  There was a car behind me that leaned on their horn as I was making the turn but I was tired enough that I didn't realize it was me that was getting honked at.\n\nI got lucky and into what would have been the far right lane of oncoming traffic in my dark gray Honda.  Fortunately there are lights all up and down this road so I didn't turn into speeding traffic.\n\nAbout the moment I realized what had happened and then shortly after realized that there was nothing I could do about it I got AS FAR OVER TO THE RIGHT (so now in the leftmost lane) and noticed a painted police car pulling up RIGHT BESIDE ME going the correct way, the \\*\\*\\*SECOND\\*\\*\\* I saw the paintjob I turned my headlights off and panicked and the MOMENT he was behind me (going forward) I swung into the Uhaul parking lot and drove through the gate.  \n\n\nI'm so glad that no one was hurt in this ridiculous endeavor, I'm also real grateful that the officer (hopefully) had better things to do or was maybe just looking the other way.

I never stand near the edge of the platform for obvious reason. I notice a woman walk past me then walk back. I’m not paying too much attention but I’m always alert to some degree. A few mins later she comes up to me and goes “excuse me, does this line go to ______ neighborhood” and I respond with “I’m pretty sure it does, yea”. Immediately she turns to a man standing behind me and she says to him, “the train does go there.” I turn to him right away because I’m uncomfortable with anyone standing directly behind me on a train platform and I repeat the info to him but this man is not looking at me at all. Not only is he not making eye contact (he’s looking down and away), but he’s also physically turning his face away from me. My stomach dropped so fast the second I realized how close to he was standing behind me and how much he was avoiding me seeing his face. I immediately back away from them and use the excuse of, “let me just go double check,” since the train line they asked about happened to be pulling into the station. I walk towards the train, look at the panel w/the route on it, and I confirm to them from a distance. She’s looking at me with this frozen fake smile on her face and neither of them have budged from where they’re standing. That was all the confirmation I needed that they were up to something and I speed walk away to the other side of the platform. I look over and she is standing in the same place I left her, staring at me out of the corner of her eye, not breaking eye contact. At this point, I just run to the complete opposite side, where I could be hidden/out of their line of sight and my heart is pounding out of my chest.

Just had a sense of doom and general unwellness. My wife at the time said it was probably just nerves and malnutrition from driving for 12 straight hours, I reluctantly agreed.\n\nAbout 24hrs later I didn't want to eat and kept feeling worse and worse. We were in Colorado and she suggested I try some weed, which I never had before but everyone kept saying how it's so amazing and could help with general issues of feeling unwell. So, I got some, smoke WAY more than I should've, because I had no idea, and passed out where I was sitting within 10min.\n\nFast forward 2 days later I'm still not feeling well and feeling very winded when I just walk around (this back in late 2018, so no COVID). I drove us home and tried to sleep it off, but the following days I just kept getting worse. I went to 4, yes 4! different ER's over the following week and everyone kept saying I was fine, but I knew I wasn't! \n\nWent to the mall that same week to walk around and see if it would help, it didn't, only made me feel worse. On the drive home from the mall I got sudden chest pain but my wife at the time (she's my ex-wife now for many reasons) convinced me that I was fine even though I wanted to go to the ER because I thought something was wrong.\n\nFollowed up with my normal doctor the following week and was told I was fine again. The same day as this I got MASSIVE and sudden pain in my leg that disapated just as quick as it came on after I took a few steps. At this same time I got MASSIVE sudden chest pain. Like shit wasn't right type pain. I said fuck this I'm going to the heart specialty hospital.\n\nWhen I arrived I told the tending that was standing at the door like I feel I'm going to pass out and get me a wheelchair. I sat down and the next thing I know I'm waking up in a bed with about 10 people around me ripping my clothes off and everything was in deafened slow motion like in a COD game when you get hit with a flash bang.\n\nDoc was trying to figure shit out and I just blurted out \"I think I have massive blood clot that caused a heart attack and turned into a huge pulmonary embolism.\" Luckily for me the doctor listened, ran the test and sure as shit I was right. I got started on some strong blood thinners and clot busting medicine and spent 3 weeks in ICU and now have a stent place in my Iliac vien... I was only 30 when this happened. I now have diminished lung function and a piece of metal in me for life plus life time blood thinners and a slightly damaged heart valve all because 5 other POS doctors had their heads stuck too far up their own ass and missed the most basic diagnosis of a PE, which is racing heart and feeling winded when walking very short distances.\n\nI almost died that day and because I was reading up on what my issue could be my lovely ADHD brain blurted out the thing that made me dodge the taticle nuke of death.\n\nThe so called reason everyone kept passing over it being a DVT or PE was because my O2 stats where above 95% the entire time, even after the huge 8.5cm saddle PE hit. I used to be in the military and was very fit until a back injury and PTSD took me out of the game, so maybe that's why my body was \"hiding\" that.

On the way up the driver, a year or two older than me, was \"fish tailing\" the jeep we were in down the desert road on the way to the campsite. It was fun and felt safe as it was still light out and life went on.\n\nFast forward 4 hrs or so and there we are, a little more inebriated and trying to go home, a few people got stranded and asked for a ride back since we were the last ones there. With a jeep full of 9 people now, and a driver who was way more inpaired then I originally thought, we headed back down that dirt road on the way back into town. The jeep was packed and only had 5 seat belts. Nobody had one on. We had the driver in his seat, myself and best friend splitting the front passenger seat, 5 in the back row, and one of my other best friends in the rear compartment where the subwooger was.\n\nFishtailing down the road we were all having a blast. So much that I put my body halfway out the window and took in what was a good moment for a 15 year old kid. The Fishtailing continued to get more and more aggressive and Before I knew it I heard a girl who we had just picked up stranded scream \"Stop!!! we're going to flip!\". The voice inside my head started to question my decision to be hanging halfway out the window.\n\nAt that point I made the best decision of that night and possibly my life. I stuck my head and body back in the car. Not even 2 seconds later it happened. BAM! We came around so hard that the tires grabbed and we flipped that Jeep Grand Cherokee 2 and 3/4 flips and struck the passenger side first.\n\nHad my head still been out the window I would have most certainly been killed instantly. It all happened so fast and I remember when the car came to rest I took a huge gaspe of air and thought, \"I have to get out as fast as possible\". I crawled directly up through the first window I could find and fell to the desert floor. I picked myself up limped about 10 ft from the car, turned around and took it all in. I didn't hear a single sound and the jeep I was staring at was completely destroyed and laying on its side smashed to pieces. Not sure if it was from shock, the ringing in my ears,or everyone just being speechless but I heard silence. At that moment I thought I was the only person to survive the wreck. After I few more seconds I heard a yell from who I assume was the same girl who screamed we were going to flip and I ran back to the jeep to pull out my friends.\n\nI'll never know how but every single person walked out of that wreck on there own or with a helping hand except one. The crazy part is we couldn't find him in the vehicle. He was one of my best friends and we were freaking out. It was pitch black out and we looked everywhere in the Jeep. Then we turned to looking outside and found him about 20 to 30 ft behind the jeep on the ground limp. He was thrown through the back window as the subwoofer detached and hit him. I ran as fast as I could and did everything I could to keep him conscious. We made a call and had a friend with a truck who had left 10 min before us come back and we put him in the bed not knowing if he would make it on the way to the hospital.\n\nThe next 30 mins got even stranger. A police helicopter started to circle overhead with its spotlight directly on us and the wreck a few minutes later, and we were convinced that the cops would show up in cars at any moment. We didn't call the police since we were all underage and most had drinken at least 1 drink. Fast forward and the helicopter just flys off and police never came. Driver tells everyone to start walking and leave while he used a crowbar to mess the ignition and radio up (although already messed up) to make the car look stolen. We leave and next day he tells me to not say shit and say the car was gone when we came out of a movie theater.\n\nTo conclude (sorry, long post) he totally got away with the stolen report, all of us kids never told any of our parents until years and years later, my friend who got tossed from the Jeep survived and is doing well to this day. I never said anything to my parents until later in my twenties as I was 2 weeks from my driver's license test and knew my mom wouldn't let me take it if she knew. Everyone survived with nothing but small gashes and scrapes other than our friend who got thrown from the vehicle. He had some major stitches, concussion, and messed up his arm a bit. Doctors said he only survived because he was limp when the accident happened since he was intoxicated. He told the doctor and police that he thought it would be a good idea to try and roll out the door of a friend's moving vehicle. I'm the end we got away with everything and it was singles handily the stupidest moment of my teenage years.\n\nInteresting Tidbits:\n\nOur friend tossed from the rear of the jeep had just lost his virginity to the same girl from the story in the same spot in the jeep that he almost lost his life in.\n\nI never saw that girl again until over 10 years later when my brother started dating a girl who was telling me one night in a bar about an accident she was in when she was a teenager. She turned out to be the same girl from that night and now my best buddy and brother are Eskimo brothers. 😂\n\nI passed my driver's test 2 weeks later and haven't been in a wreck since. 🤞\n\nLastly, I always contributed the outcome of that night to how well that jeep was constructed and how it saved us. I always said \"one day I will buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee\" and just a few months ago I did just that. I owe my life to that Jeep and wanted to repay my debts to such a fantastic vehicle. \n\n\nTLDR: Did some stupid teenage shenanigans in a Jeep in the desert and the voice inside my head and the voice screaming from the back of my head made me make a split second decision that saved my life.",

I was riding snowmobile earlier in the season and the lake we usually ride on had not yet frozen all the way this I did not know, as I was riding I realized that the snow and ice behind me had turned into water and I was slowing down. I quickly realized what was going to happen if I didn’t make it to shore but I was probably 100 ft from shore or more and I gunned it made about 10 more ft and my right ski broke through the ice and caught under the ice. (I was doing about 60 mph) My handle  bar jerked and my right hand and handle bar punched me in the helmet breaking my visor and nearly knocking me unconscious, messed up my face and hand pretty good my eyebrow had a nice gash. I was in 20+ ft of freezing water and ice and land wasn’t close by, my sled was fully submerged in about 10 seconds and I was left in the water with full gear on. I thought I was going to die and when people say your life flashes before your eyes it’s a real thing cause it happened right then and there, but I didn’t want to die yet. The ice was only about 2-3 inches thick so I starting smashing with my elbows on the ice using that to keep me afloat, i did this till I was almost to shore but as I got closer the ice got thicker and it got to the point where it was to thick and I couldn’t break through and it was to deep to touch the bottom. I was about 10 ft from land from safety, and I couldn’t do anything I was tired and cold and my energy was draining, i almost gave up but I still had my helmet on and I had a jagged piece of my visor on and I broke it off and it was just pointy and sturdy enough to stab into the ice and slowly drag myself up onto it. Once I was up on top of the ice I was so cold I will never forget how bone chilling cold that was. I got up and started running down the shore to a bridge that was about half a mile away by the time I got there I had almost passed out but thankfully a Good Samaritan had been driving down that lonely road that day or I might’ve just froze to death in the ditch. I will never forget that day or that man that saved me. \n\nWater scares the hell out of me now though.",

As most people we had a tour guide and a group of porters that would walk in front to set up camp at the various camp sites along the way. \n\nWhen we reached the last camp before the sumit, it was dusk and me and my friend were so tired we just ate and went to sleep into the tent setup by the porters before we arrived at camp. \n\nAfter a few hours I wake up feeling the need to water mother earth. Since we were both so exhausted and I didn’t want to wake up my friend, I decided I would not wake up my friend by turning on the head lamp I already had attached on my head. Moreover,  since our tent was a small 3-person tent with entry opening at both ends of it, I decided I would use the other exit (other than the one we used going in) to make less noice. \n\nSo I open the “door” and crawl out. It is pitch black, can hardly see anything. I try to take one step forward and then I stumble on a rock, causing me to fall to my left. I get back up and continue left for a few meters, do “my thing” and walk back to the tent and go to sleep (I can make out the tent in the dark because the tent lines has luminescent markings on them). \n\nA few hours later we get up and ready to make the climb to the top, using the normal tent exit this time. Then I put on my head lamp and as I am standing there I suddenly become aware that the tent had actually been set up 1.5 meters from the edge of a cliff, with a drop of ~50m vertical. And the tent exit I had used earlier that night was facing directly towards the cliff edge…..\n\nSo if I had not stumbled to the left on that rock when I was getting out from the tent earlier, I would most likely had just walked straight off that cliff unknowingly. That would have been a nice darwin award, found a the bottom of that “valley” with my head lamp not switched on…\n\nThe look on my friends face when I told him what ai had done earlier told me everything…",

The park was deserted that day aside from one woman and her young son and the two of us and we were not close to the play ground. He kept me there chatting for almost an hour while I tried to politely leave and he kept offering that if I every needed help or a place to crash or just “hang out” that I could go to his place because “all” the teenagers went to him for help. If that were true I would know because teens talk to each other, especially if it’s about safe places to go and places not to go and he was not someone I heard about. He made absolutely sure I knew exactly which house was his and that his door was always open. I knew exactly where he lived because I knew the elderly couple who lived behind him and helped them with house work from time to time. Finally he let me go, but not without forcing a hug on me. \n\nI left the park as calmly as possible and as soon i was out of sight of the park I booked it home taking every round about road and ally I could think of and cutting through as many yards as possibly just in case he followed me.

I'm from an African country and like it's not everyone who gets lucky enough to work under someone who is like from your country but has access to real global leaders. \nNow, working under her, I had lived through the worst conditions. First, she talks a good talk but doesn't walk it much. You know the bosses who want the employees to take ownership of their business as if we split profits 50/50. Who expect you to work ungodly hours, I'm talking 3am email that needs work completed by 10. So one day, after working a whole weekend that I was supposed to be off where I ran an event from MC to coordination to handling the PR and comms aspect, I had had enough. Why? On Monday, she gave everyone an off day apart from me. \nI showed up and guess what, it was for a meeting that I hadn't even been invited to where I was called incompetent for not being prepared. I got so mad since I had done so much already and I decided I'm going to quit.\nEveryone thought I was mad. Now fast forward to now, about a year later, I'm turning 24 and I work with a company that respects my time, in fact, I haven't shown up to the office in a month, just working from home since I deliver on my tasks. P.S. I'm the only one with that privilege. I got promoted 2 months before time and I run a department. Now people who remained in her company are as frustrated as they come and worst part is since she's kind of a brainwasher, they believe life should be lived that way, in total stress and tension.\nIt was hard leaving, thought I'd made the worst mistake since I lost on top of the job, my mentor who was one of her close friends. she basically told me how she thinks I'm not going to make it and I told myself, I have no business having a mentor who doesn't believe in me.\nAlso, she badmouthed me but what's funny is the people who she badmouthed me to wanted to hire me still. She told them that they let me go while I actually just quit. \nIt's not easy quitting and it's not easy rebuilding but what I've come to learn is that you should have some values that you are not afraid to communicate and stand for because if you do, others will respect it. In my interview for the current company I'm working with, I communicated how things like communication of expectations is key to me, things like having time to do my research and plan out strategies is important to me and now, my bosses really treat me with that dignity. \nI guess the big dodge wasn't the job really but the mindset shift. That to get treated right, you need to start acting like an expert who knows what they want and not an intern who is waiting to be told what to do.\nHope this helps someone :)",

Did 1 year and got out on probation, lifetime restraining order on me from him and got torn apart by the judge for being a trained soldier and boxer, decimating him and basically committing vigilante justice.\nStill, got time off for my army service and my guilty please, went down from 5 years to 2, so was happy. Apparently he is inside now for being a NONCE.\n\nI got time but I dodged a MASSIVE nuke that could have seen me get 20 years.",

First child’s birth was totally fine, but the second kiddo wasn’t thrilled at being evicted. About 12 hours in, my contractions started feeling…odd. I had the nurse come in and take a look and she immediately called the doctor. Doctor barely made into the room before I had a full placental abruption (placenta tears away from uterine walls) and began to bleed out. I passed out from the pain but my husband said that he’d never seen so much blood and it was the most terrifying thing he’d ever witnessed.\n\nI was immediately rushed into surgery and they actually sent for the hospital chaplain to sit with my husband because they weren’t confident about my chances. Thankfully, the room was already prepped for another patient who had chosen an elective c-section and was literally about to be wheeled in for treatment so they didn’t even have to locate the instruments necessary. I just ended up delaying her delivery an hour of so.\n\nKiddo and I survived without serious complication (besides the fact that I cannot have another child) but they told me I was so close to death that had the doctor not been right in the room with me when it happened, my son and I would have died. It was only because I had chosen to deliver drug-free and could feel that my contractions were off that both me and my youngest are alive.",

Also, it might just be buried among the thousands of replies to this post.  \n\n\nWhen I was 15, I started dating this guy that was three years older. My relationship before him (my first ever relationship and my longest one to date) was toxic as hell (disclaimer: got cheated on). Because of the toxicity of my previous relationship, I thought that the guy I was seeing (the topic of this post) was going to be alright - nothing could be worse than having a cheating partner right? Wrong. Maybe it was the fact that I was so young and he was so much older than me (I think we can agree that 3 years is big age gap when you're 15 and naive), but I felt the need to always listen to him and believe that everything he said was true. Before long, we became official and we met each other's families.   \n\n\nOne night, when he was 19 and I was 16, I insisted we went to his house to hang out and possibly make out. Truthfully, I did not expect anything more would happen that night since having sex was never in my mind. However, one thing led to another and before I knew it, he was on top of me. There was one other time that was probably the worst moment of the hell-bound relationship. I was at his place, taking care of him because he was sick and his parents weren't home. He asked if we could do anal and because of my naive brain that wanted so desperately for his love and approval, I said yes.   \n\n\nIt hurt so bad that I started screaming \"stop\". I pretty sure I was loud enough but he said he didn't hear me say it and that if he had heard me he \"would've stopped\". I think I knew at that time that it was sexual abuse but it took me years to fully grasp what happened to me. There was a time that I couldn't even get to finish a sentence talking about it before bursting into tears. Anyway, I moved away for school less than half a year after becoming official and needless to say, some sense came into me and I broke it off with him (still don't know to this day how I was able to convince myself to leave him).   \n\n\nIt sucks for me to admit that he still affects me to this day. I get triggered sometimes when I am reminded of him. One time, someone who looked so much like him came to install wifi into my apartment and all I could do was stare at this guy and think that he might pounce on me. He wasn't ever physically abusive but the emotional manipulation was strong. I prioritized him and his needs over my family, my friends, nd myself. He demanded my attention 24/7 and since I \"loved\" him, I gave it.   \n\n\nYears later, I found out that he had a girlfriend after we broke up that had gotten pregnant. Because of his sociopathic idiosyncrasies, he wanted to get his way. He told the girl to get an abortion because he would not support her or the child. I am not sure if she was forced to abort the kid or she opted to have him/her/them without his support. I don't have enough information on me to follow that up, but he is now in a mother relationship and they have a child together. I still think about what could have happened if I stayed and listened to my naive brain that made me think my worth was based on how much value I was able to give other people (how much I could satisfy them).  \n\n\n  \nSupplemental side story: I had met someone (just a male friend) a few months after he and I broke up and we started talking. I happened to share about what happened between me and my ex. We were really starting to get close when all of a sudden, he stopped messaging. A few weeks later, I asked him what did I do wrong and he revealed to me that my ex and a friend of theirs told this \"friend\" to \"befriend\" me only to collect information about me and then ditch me. It hurt a lot at that time because in my state of trying to heal from what happened, I thought I had garnered a friend after pushing away all of my previous friends as a result of being in a relationship with that excuse of an ass-wipe. Years later, this \"fried\" messaged me out of the blue saying how sorry he was about what he had done and that everything I thought about my ex was true. I guess it was nice to know that I wasn't crazy and over exaggerating what he did to me.",

Blurred vision, headache = migraine, right?  Painkillers didn't touch them but that's not unusual for migraines.\n\nI'd go to bed and they'd be gone in the morning so, again, seemed like a migraine.  \n\nI think I'd had two before the last one hit, but this one was worse.  Nearly fell over with the pain when it hit me.  Blurred vision and light sensitivity was immediate rather than gradual.  Barely made it to bed.\n\nSeems obvious now that I should've went for help, but I kept telling myself it was just another migraine and it would go away in the morning.  I decided to call the doctor if it hadn't gone away by then.\n\nWell, luckily, it didn't.  Went into the doctor and even a painkiller injection didn't touch it.  Puked from the pain.  Got sent up to opthalmology because I've got some other eye problems and they wanted to rule out anything eye-related.\n\nIt was glaucoma - high pressure in the eye - and it was such severe glaucoma that they thought I'd already permanently damaged my vision (by the time you have blurred vision and pain it can be too late, your optic nerve may already be damaged).  \n\nThey made me lie on my back to reduce the pressure while they grabbed the medicine I'd need, and that's when I realised: the two \"migraines\" I'd had that went away, I'd woken up on my back.  The third one from that morning, I'd woken up on my side.  \n\nI have no way of knowing for sure, but if those earlier \"migraines\" were the same thing, lying on my back must have reduced the pressure enough to calm things down by the morning.  Lying on my side meant the pressure had built up and hadn't gone away.  So it could've got my sight BUT it did make me go to the doctor.\n\nThey'd never seen someone with such high pressure before so I only found out later just how worried they'd been.  They really thought I'd already lost my sight, it was that bad.  But the next morning the blurriness had cleared up and I got emergency surgery to sort out the cause of the glaucoma.  The consultant did a full on happy dance when it was all over.\n\nNow I don't want to worry anyone; if you get what you think is a migraine, it usually is.  When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras - and this was definitely a zebra for someone my age.\n\nHowever!  It's worth getting your eyes checked out regularly and it's worth investigating if you get any change in vision, just to make sure you're alright.  Also worth getting migraines checked out too, of course, but don't worry that your next migraine is going to be glaucoma.",

He dove into the pond and it was not deep enough in that spot.  He broke his neck at the C6 vertebrae and couldn’t move.  Thankfully one of the friends was getting out of the pond to get another beer and tripped over him.  This was in 1974 when he was 21.  So they pulled him out and propped him against a tree.  He wasn’t able to speak.  Since he hadn’t moved they decided to dress him and drug him into the house.  Still no change so they put him in a car and took him home to his parents house.  They were all drunk and stoned, including him.  The guys had him by the underarms face down and head hanging and drug him to the house.  His parents knew he was in trouble and called for an ambulance.  He was taken to a large hospital in another town and the doctors didn’t even think he would live let alone walk again.  After days in traction they did surgery and he spent three months in a special bed being turned every day.  I still can’t believe that after all of that he didn’t have any deficits from it and he could do anything he wanted to until cancer took him five years ago.  I am still stunned by his recovery from a broken neck.\n\nNow the story of me and my stepmom.  I will start by saying that we did everything you are never supposed to do in this situation, but we were lucky.  Years ago my stepmom was bringing me home from seeing my neck surgeon and we had a flat tire on a highway so we pull over.  No cellphones yet.  We get out, me with a cane and neck brace, to figure out what we were going to do A lady leaving a subdivision stopped and had a cellphone and offered to call for help.  She also had me sit in her car to stay warm.  She had to call her husband so he could call for help.  I get out and my stepmom and I are waiting for help.  Right after that a pickup truck pulled over in front of us.  A guy in overalls with a brace on his hand asked if we needed help.  He tried filling the tire up but it went flat really fast.  Then a State Police guy stopped behind us with his lights on and stayed at his car.  The guy that did stop said that he lived just a little way further away and offered to refill the tire and for us to follow him to his place.  We did and he wanted to take his car so we could get in to take us to our town’s tire place.  A long way too.  He said he had to pick his son up from school first and then we would go.  The whole time I am thinking about warnings about men tricking women and all that stuff.  So we do that and the tire gets fixed and he drives us all the way back to his place.  He put the tire back on the van and we were ready to go home.  He wouldn’t accept any money for helping us and we thanked him profusely for all he did for us!  On the drive home I said that we did everything you are not supposed to do in that situation but we were lucky about how it all went.",

            "text": "When I was 10 my sister & I had a girlfriend that lived at the end of our block. Her name was Carmen. We used to go to her house a lot. She was older than us but she was super nice and more like an older sister. Every once in a while we'd see her dad when we'd visit. He was wheelchair-bound and never really said much but was always very nice. One day he came to our door and told our parents that Carmen was decorating for prom and needed help and could one of us go help her. He said it didn't matter which one. I volunteered because my sister just ignored him. So off we went towards their house. We went inside and he went into the bedroom to grab something. A few minutes later he asked for help. I went in to help him. He was just sitting in his wheelchair and he pulled me onto his lap. He told me to give him a kiss on the cheek. I was so scared but suddenly there was a knock at the door. He wheeled over to the window and said, \"It's my son. Run out the back door and go home. Don't tell your parents anything!\" I agreed and ran home through a field that was in the back of the housing tract. When I got home my parents asked why and I told them his son stopped by and he told me to go home. They asked if anything happened but I said no. I was afraid to tell them and super confused. I went to my room. My sister came in and she knew something wasn't right. She pushed until I told her what happened then she told my parents. They questioned me and I told them what he did. About 5 minutes later he knocked on our door. My dad answered and almost beat the shit out of him. He denied it and left. The next day my mom called the police and he was arrested. We found out that he had a long record of pedophilia. No surprise there and not a lot of punishment back then. This happened in the early 70's when kids weren't all that afraid of or aware of stranger danger. His son saved me from a lot of trauma.",

During my junior summer of high school, I was heading home from practice when someone driving in the left lane motioned for me to roll down my window. Yelling over the wind they said that my radiator had blown and smoke was coming from my car. I thanked them and proceeded to pull over to the side of the highway and immediately saw the smoke that had previously been blowing under due to the high speeds. The car I was driving was my brother's and a 1999 clutch Subaru but still, a reliable car that my brother barely had problems with so I was a bit shocked but mostly annoyed. \n\nI called my family's home phone but no one picked up. Trying a few more times I started to get annoyed and thought \"nothing could be more important than this, why aren't people picking up?\". Finally, I got a hold of my mom and told her what happened. She was very quiet which was a different reaction than I was expecting. I finally asked what was going on and she said that something had happened to my dad but she was very hesitant to tell me anything which made me more anxious. I was sitting alone on the side of the highway with a broken-down car thinking of worst-case scenarios about my dad. She finally said that his heart had stopped and that they didn't know what it was yet but they didn't think it was a heart attack. She said that they had gotten his heart started again and they were going through the procedure of gently helping his body adjust to the sudden stoppage of blood flow (this especially helps with brain damage). From there I was left to figure out the car situation while my brother drove to pick me up. I was able to get a hold of one of my coaches who had AAA and he drove to me to wait for the pickup truck. They had to tow it the 40 minutes to my home city because the city I was in had no good mechanics. My coach who is the kindest, and I am so grateful for him, had it towed for us for free using his miles. My brother made it to me fairly quickly after my coach arrived and took me to the hospital (he was definitely doing 90 mph the whole way). \n\nAfter my dad eventually woke up they put a camera in him to find out what caused his heart to stop. They didn't initially think it was a heart attack because he was so healthy, exercised regularly, and ate good foods. They said the three things it could be were a major artery blockage meaning heart bypass surgery and a pacemaker, an electrical issue that can be super difficult to deal with, or a nonmajor artery was blocked and a stent would need to be put in. We got the best of the three options and they were able to put the stent in when they found the artery that had caused the heart attack. He has now fully recovered and didn't have any brain damage, he just remembers some of the frisbee game and then waking up in the hospital. \n\nMy dad had been in the backcountry backpacking the week prior to his heart attack and in photos, he was very pale and sickly looking, he also remembers getting tired more quickly than usual. My dad, also usually bikes home from work, and hours before his heart attack he biked through parts of a trail that barely any people walkthrough, and wouldn't have been found for hours. When he did have his heart attack, it was in a park while playing a friendly game of ultimate frisbee and a guy on the other team had had CPR certification training the week prior. Also just across the highway from the park was a fire station and a bridge so that ambulances could easily cross the highway during emergencies. So my dad had a heart attack, not in the backcountry with no cell service, but instead, in a populated park with someone who was CPR certified, across a bridge from a fire station, in a state with the best hospitals, cutting edge technology and research. His heart had only stopped for one minute before the guy got it started again and the ambulance was there within two. \n\nAlso, after we left the hospital our water heater broke. But as they say, bad things come in threes.",

I pondered... standing a few hours watching planes fly or having fun on several attractions... tough choice ;) To the park we went. And the day was really nice. Dad and I had fun and when we got home, the air show was in the news: \nIt was the Ramstein air show disaster.\n70 dead, ~500 injured.\nFootage was shown: knowing my father, we would've been in the first row.\n\n12 years later: I'm on a train with two friends who work(ed) for Deutsche Bahn. On a small station we needed to stop so another train could pass. We go again and arrive at Cologne Main 30 minutes later or so. Here we learn that a few minutes after we left, a train derailed at the small station. 9 people died, 4 of which lived in my village of about 900. Yes, I knew them all.\nWeird coincidence: that small station is Brühl... also home of the theme park I went in '88.\n\nI also drove myself to the hospital with back pain in 2017 only to get surgery that same day (double bypass, two stents) because the back pain was a heart attack that would have killed me this very evening.\n\nAnd in 2020 I thought I had a large carbuncle (VERY NSFW to google) on my nethers, started getting tired, nauseous and indifferent to everything (like not eating or drinking) and didn't want to go to a hospital (why? Let me sleep...). My mom said she suddenly saw my abdomen glow red with a line to my heart and asked a neighbor to drive me to the Bundeswehrzentralkrankenhaus.\nDoctors there had to put VapoRub under their noses, because I actually had Fournier's Gangrene (EVEN WORSE NSFW), with a sepsis that would've killed me this very evening. (<- not something one likes to copy and paste)\n\nAfter a few days in a coma which I awoke out of the day my aunt died I was transferred to a hospital specialized in burn victims (flesh-eating bacteria seem to wreak havoc like that) that back in '88 (among others)took care of victims from Ramstein. \nOh, and then I almost suffocated, because of a clogged breathing tube.\n\nYeah.

At first I don't really mind it since were in a 65mph 104kph zone. But the car keeps speeding up.\n\nI let my mom know calmly that we were going too fast for my anxiety to handle and she just says \"I know.\" In an eerily calm voice that made the hairs on my neck raise. And then I could feel the moment my mom couldn't control the car on the black ice anymore and we started to spin.\n\nEven to this day I have a weird, disjointed memory of the car spinning as I just stared at my mom while we slid around into the opposite lane, our bumper hit the ice bank and flipped. We flew almost 35 feet from the road into the snow, landing upside-down. I can still feel the sensation of ice crunching against the roof of my car where I had braced my hand when we started to flip. I snapped awake hanging upside down and, for some reason my first thought was 'Aw man, my car!' followed quickly by 'Thank god we switched' because I know I wouldn't have been able to keep us from going over the railing instead.\n\nIn the end, we all got out of the accident (One of three we witnessed on that patch of road that night) with only minor bruises and a twisted rib for me.",

I stepped out and walked around the car to get the parcel. As I pulled the trunk handle, I could feel the car moving. The gentle tug of my hand was enough to set 3000 lbs of car in motion. I tried to withstand it and push it back, but at no use. It picked up some speed, and sled down the driveway towards a car parked outside the garage at about walking speed.

This would clearly get messy, insurance-wise and in terms of getting a rescue unit down the same driveway, but it wasn’t worth injuring myself as well.

I learned after the fact that Accords from around that year specifically had brake lines made from a cheaper substance, and there was a nationwide uptick in people bringing their Accords in for brake maintenance. My car hadn’t given me any trouble before, though. \n\nWe were driving down the highway going around 60 mph, which was the speed limit, when we came across one of those random highway stoplights you sometimes see on more rural highways—the ones that never give you any warning, and even if you’re going the speed limit you have to slam on your brakes to stop in time. So I did; I slammed on my brakes because I knew I wasn’t going to make it through the light before it turned red, and people in that area are known for dashing out as soon as their light turns green. \n\nSeveral other comments I’ve seen make this point, but it really is true that things go in slow motion when something dangerous happens. Both of my brake lines snapped as soon as I pressed down, and my brake pedal hit the floor while I was still going at least 50. I remember saying in disbelief, “my brakes just went out,” and my friends told me later my voice was so calm they didn’t even register what I said at first. I thought we were about to hurtle directly into the opposing traffic that was already inching forward as our light turned red. \n\nBut this is when my crazy luck came into play. Purely by chance, this happened at an intersection where the roads met at an angle where I could make a fast turn at 50 without flipping the car. Purely by chance, I was already in the right lane where I could easily make the turn without anyone blocking the way. Just my luck, the entire shoulder of the road I turned into was a wide expanse of gravel I could ride on to slow down. And as I was trying to get my car to stop, I remembered a physics lecture I had seen a week or two before where the instructor mentioned fluid pressure and how your emergency brake works on a different system than your regular brakes, so the e-brake still works even if your brakes don’t. (I know that’s common sense to anyone that knows cars, but that’s a testament to just how much everything slowed down, that I had time to remember a whole physics lecture). \n\nIn the end, I got my car to a safe stop on the side of the road before my friends even really registered that anything had happened. My best friend’s mom drove out to get us, brought us burgers and sat with us while we waited for the tow truck. I managed to wait till I got home and got in the shower before having the ‘oh my god, if anything had gone differently my friends could’ve died’ breakdown. \n\nI still get nervous if I see a stoplight going any faster than 40.",

I would make changes based on my blueprints and use controls that would turn rollers to slide it into a press.  A group on the other end would pull the pallet to their side thru the press when ready, assemble it with materials, and they would run it in an empty level to be shot with foam.  No levels were ready to be pulled at the moment, when one was ready I could raise the scissor lift to run out a completed panel and rearrange it again after using an overhead hoist to remove the products.\n\nI was training someone who was running an identitical system running parallel 15 feet behind me.  I had no level ready to pull and the trainee asked me a question so I came over to show them how to build something.  While I was helping the highest level on my side opened, it was unknown the safety switch had failed.  The other group immediately ran a pallet back into the press ramming the pallet still inside the press.  I saw a shadow and when I looked back  20 feet of pallet was hanging out until it snapped and fell .  It was the loudest noise I've ever heard.  If I had been on my side arranging tools or looking at prints it would have decapitated me.  They had to use 2 fork lifts to get the broken peice up.",

            "text": "TLDR at the bottom\n\nAbout 10 years ago now, my friend lived in Vegas, and I lived on the other side of the country.   He was staying with some friends out there, but he didn't have his car there with him.  It was still at his parents' house in the same city as me.  He called me up one day, and asked if I would be able to drive it out to him.  I figured it would be a cool weekend trip, start driving Friday, sleep, drive more Saturday, and either sleep again or just push through and finish the drive.  Then I would just fly back Sunday.\n\nOnce I got to Oklahoma, it was about 1 or 2 in the morning that Friday.  I was about 20 miles outside of Oklahoma City when suddenly the car's headlights began to dim, the radio started cutting out, and then eventually the car just died while rolling down the road.  It was pitch black where I was, so I could no longer see the road, but on my GPS it showed it was a straight shot.  I didn't have to worry about any sudden turns.  There was a gas station WAY off in the distance about 3 or 4 miles out, but none of the light from it was helping me.  I used the divots on the side of the road that help wake people up if they veer off the road to help guide me to pulling over.  Once I felt the divots on the driver's side tires I knew I was well enough off the road.\n\nI knew I had more than enough gas, but there was a sub woofer in the back that I was blasting both because I enjoy it and it was keeping me awake.  I called my dad to try to help me figure out the issue.  I explained what was happening, and he thought it might have been the battery.  I got out of the car, crawled into the back, and completely disconnected the sub.  I opened the hood, and disconnected it there as well.  I tried to turn the car on again, and the lights on the dash would barely light up.  I went back up to the front and checked anything else I could think of, the oil, any leaks, any wires broken or worn out, but nothing stood out.  My dad asked me to go around and get in on the driver's side and try to start it again.  I thought, \"Meh, I'll try from the driver's side and just reach across.\"  It was an older vehicle, so it's not like I had to put my foot on the gas for it to start.\n\nI get in on the passenger side, and as I go to reach across to put the key in the ignition suddenly the car is side swiped on the driver's side that I just almost walked around to get into with my dad on the phone.  All of the glass on the rear window, rear driver's side, and front driver's side explodes into tiny pieces and goes everywhere.  I'm on the phone with my dad still screaming every cussword in the book as I jump out of the passenger side and start jumping up and down freaking out.  My dad is on the other end going \"ARE YOU OK?  WHAT HAPPENED?\"  I look up from ducking to try to assess what just happened, and apparently an 18 wheeler with a double trailer hit me with the rear double trailer because instead of it being square/rectangle shaped, it was now on two wheels and looked more like a diamond.  He stopped about a mile up the road from me on the opposite side of the road.\n\nWhen I say glass went everywhere, I mean it went everywhere.  I was wearing socks and tennis shoes, and some glass got IN MY SOCK that was still in my shoe.  It was all in the hood of my hoodie.  The hood was on my head when the truck initially hit, but the impact knocked it off of my head and put a lot of glass in the hood.  I had shards in my pants pockets.  It was in the pockets of my hoodie.  I even had some in my lower back at my belt line.  I explained to my dad that I was ok, not a scratch on me, but the car I was in was totaled.  He was about 10 hours out from where I was, so I told him I would call the cops about the accident first.  I called the cops, made the report, and they told me a trooper would be out in about 20 minutes.  I explained that I wasn't hurt, but I wasn't sure about the truck driver.\n\nThe highway patrol came out along with a firetruck and an ambulance.  The firemen and the Ambulance crew were all looking at the situation and making sure I was ok while the trooper went to check on the truck driver and get his statement.  When the trooper came back, the driver was perfectly fine, but he was stating that I was parked out in the middle of the road.  The Firemen, Ambulance crew, and the trooper were all looking at the car I was in.  Both the front and rear tires were about a foot to the right of the yellow line, so I was clearly off the side of the road.  The trooper took pictures and let me know that if I needed anything for insurance that he would be able to help.  I explained that I was on a trip, and that I didn't have someone to just come get me easily.  He offered to drive me up to the gas station to wait for either my dad or a taxi.  I had a few things with me that I was bringing out to my friend, so I guess I seemed homeless.  It was raining out by the time I got to the gas station, so I brought the stuff inside and sat at a table by the window.  No one was there except 2 workers, and shortly after I sat down they were telling me I couldn't stay there.  I explained the situation about the wreck, but they must have thought I was lying even though the trooper dropped me off.  The eventually kicked me out, so I carried everything outside and sat up against the wall under a balcony so I wouldn't get rained on and the stuff wouldn't get wet.\n\nI called my friend and let him know what happened to me and the car.  He was and still is a great friend because he instantly said he didn't care about the car.  He was just worried if I was ok.  I explained that I was, and we worked on a plan.\n\nI remembered that my old childhood friend lived close to Stillwater, OK (about an hour from where I was), so I called her.  I explained the situation, and her and her boyfriend came out to get me.  My other friend's mom who lives in Vegas called me up after hearing about it and bought me a plane ticket from OKC to Vegas for a day and then a separate plane ticket to get me back home.  When my friend from Stillwater came to get me, they drove me to the airport in OKC and dropped me off for my flight.  I flew to Vegas, stayed the day, and then flew home that night.\n\nI did have some PTSD from it because about 2 weeks after I got back I was driving home from work and the same company 18 wheeler with the double trailers passed by me.  They weren't speeding or doing anything out of the ordinary, but I started uncontrollably crying.  Even while crying I was like \"WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME!?  NOTHING JUST HAPPENED!  I'M FINE!\"  I'd say it took a good year or two to finally get passed that.  Anytime a double trailer would drive anywhere near me I would just have to out loud tell myself \"I'm ok. I'm ok.  I'm ok.\" until either they passed me or I passed them.  The worst part of all of it was that I was on the phone with my dad.  The thought of the last thing him hearing would have been me screaming and then the silence really got to me.  Either that or I was there on the phone, and then suddenly I wouldn't have been.\n\nTLDR; Almost 10 years ago, I was driving across the country late at night in the middle of nowhere Oklahoma, the car died, I pulled over, and while on the phone with my dad an 18 wheeler with a double trailer side swiped the driver's side of the car that my dad had just asked me to walk around from the hood to get in to try to start the car.  Luckily I had chose to get in from the passenger side and reach across to start it.  Got dropped off at a gas station by a highway patrolman, realized I had a childhood friend who happened to live about an hour from where I was, and they gave me a ride from middle of nowhere, OK to Oklahoma City.  A friend's mom who lived in Vegas bought me a flight out, spent the day with them, and then flew home.  Suffered from some PTSD for a year or 2 anytime I saw double trailers on the road.  I'm ok now.",

            "text": "Oh boy this is going to be interesting. Spent a year of my life with my ex, she had some mental health issues etc., and the minimal changes I asked her to do she never did. I couldn’t handle the relationship anymore mentally so I decided to break it off as my mental health was starting to become at risk. She came over, cried to me for hours trying to get me back together with her and I refuse to give in and let me explain why I know I made the right choice. Five days later, she makes a tinder, announces she’s going through a “hoe phase” and has already slept with two guys. Cut her hair and dyed it and got a new tattoo. I wasted a year of my life building this person up, taking care of them, fixing the broken pieces and now this. She acted like I treated her poorly the entire relationship and how she wanted to get over me so bad yet, I always put her first. I always took care of her, was there for her and I never got a/n “you are appreciated” or “thank you for what you do and taking care of me.” That just completely faded out the last few months of the relationship. Remember gentlemen, you can turn a girlfriend into a housewife, but you can’t turn a hoe into a housewife. Take my advice, if you are in a toxic relationship and you can’t go on any further, leave the person. Don’t wait, don’t force it to be stretched out, just go. If they’re bad for you, don’t torture yourself and stay with them when there’s better out there. It isn’t always you. Took me too damn long to learn that.",

            "text": "I have dodged several. My ex fiance aunt (I will refer to as the aunt) helped me get a job when I was having trouble getting one a few years ago.\n\nThis is at a department store and my job would be to unload a truck every day and to sort materials and hang clothes. I was flexible and would work dressing rooms and stock shelves. Its not a bad gig.\n\nHowever my supervisor didn't like me. That's cool, sometimes people don't like you and thats fine.\n\nHowever, the aunt was a tattle tale and a busy body. She loved drama. She fed off of it.\n\nSo here's what happened. She and her friends at work trained me. Then I was told by them and the supervisor that that way they trained me was wrong do it a different way. While I was doing it that way, they told me to go back to the original way they taught me. This flip stopped for a long while.\n\nAt this time, the rumor mill started. The aunt and her friends were a bunch of middle school mean girls stuck in the bodies of 50 year olds.\n\nI wasnt the only one on the rumor mill. They claimed a coworker of mine was having sex with a manager. Got them sent to the office. Nothing happened to them.\n\nBecause of the aunt and her friends rumors I nearly got fired. My hours went from 40 to 10 and 8 a week.  I was blamed for things that happened when I wasn't there at the store. I was claimed for being unproductive. I was claimed my hearing aid was a lie. I was claimed that I was lazy. I was claimed for just about everything. A fucking kid threw a tantrum over a toy and that was because \"I put the toys out too fast.\" Hell I was even almost written up for not sweating (I'm not someone who sweats gallons of sweat).\n\nThree people quit crying because of the aunt and her friends. And a teenager was forced quitted by her mother after she found out this girl was worked without a lunch and for 14 days straight (she was 16) which I am pretty sure is illegal.\n\nWell I told the supervisor, as I was to go to her first and compile a complaint against the aunt and her friends. The supervisor fucking told them I told on them!\n\nIf I had some sort of proof on paper or something, I would have had a lawyer. \n\nAnyways the aunt retaliated by calling the law and claiming I was standing outside her mother's house smoking weed and stalking her family.\n\nEverything blew over because the \"weed\" was a dead skunk the sheriff pulled out of the ditchline, and the \"stalker\" was likely the kerson who put the skunk in the ditchine after running it over in the first place. \n\n I'm getting tired of people calling the law on me when I wont bend or break to their might and bullying. She is the third person to do that to me.\n\nThe other one is my sister and the second is my ex.\n\nMy ex, Fboy ( name changed) cheated on me, so I left. Because he took my virginity that I highly valued, and I had no self worth I forgave him. He left me for the community mule and she cheated on him. Anyways, he tried cheating on his new gf with me. I tell her whats going on, she leaves him.\n\nHe starts stalking me and threatening to kill me. Campus police tell me that basically you can follow someone around all day and tell everyone how you're going tk kill them and ruin their life. Eventually after another ex of his reports him stalking her, they take it seriously. \n\nSo he drags me to court and tries to sue ME over slander and when that case was thrown out calls the cops, who pretty much lsugh at him too.\n\nMy sister called the cops on me when I was 16 over a fucking candy bar. She claimed she was getting beaten by me and my mother and the cops came, and everything. CPS comes too. They remove her and charges were pending on mom and I because my sister told them she was scared of us and feared for life every day and can she please go live with dad.\n\nShe did that a lot. I never forgot how my life was almost ruined because she couldn't have a candy bar because she wasted her dinner and was also told to wash dishes. \n\nI do not have any warrants or anything against my record. Its clean but holy shit!",

We met with the estate agents, we talked terms.  After that things started to get weird, the nature of the business began changing in prospective partners mind.  All kinds of wild and crazy ideas, the terms of the lease was proposed to rely on the one person who had more cash.

I must have subconsciously sensed something as I had begun backing off and increasing distance and dodging notion of signing any contracts.  The time came when I had received a fairly moderate sized payment from a business dealing and refused this persons advice on a purchase unrelated to business idea and he went nuclear and exploded any friendship or partnership we ever could have had.  Turns out as time went on I found out he was seriously manipulative and actually abusive in personal relationships.  A proper sociopath.  I had loaned him money informally for a fix to a car (a trivial sum of about 500) and that of course was lost but I had already had trouble recovering it before any trouble.  That probably played into me distancing myself.  \n\nBullet dodged, nuclear financial disaster dodged as I could have lost tens of thousands in rent.  \n\nTo be honest it is incidents like that which led to me seeking a change in career as I suspect I need employment over these self employed construction and retail ventures.

My grandma(the one with way more common sense between the two) wanted to call an ambulance but it was too late... he was driving himself to the hospital. He pulls up to the hospital, walks in, immediately goes into cardiac arrest and falls down. In doing this he cracked his head open on the wall or the ground and had bleeding on the brain. He survived this! But to think if he went into cardiac arrest minutes earlier he would have probably crashed and died while possibly killing someone else in the process. Prob the best place to go into cardiac arrest... the hospital. \n\nHe lived a long healthy life after this, but sadly passed this year due to covid. We had to put him in a nursing home because we couldn't take care of him like they could... like lifting and bathing. BUT we were very worried because nursing homes are breeding grounds for covid(and he hadn't gotten his shot yet)... well we were right(and also the nursing home neglecting to give him his life sustaining water pill... which we are looking into) In the end he didn't suffer and got to finally see his wife again. Who knows maybe if they properly medicated him as the doctor ordered he might not have passed. Maybe if we tried to get him vaccinated sooner... his shot was scheduled a month out.

I reiterate that I was already 18 when he began dating, so no odd law-related stuff going on there.\n\nHe was nice - had been cheated on twice by two different people - and naive me back then didn't think much of it. After a while, all he talked about was sex. He was a chain smoker, had been involved with drugs, drank a bit, was obsessed with cartoons, etc. Never mind, I thought, no one is perfect. I should've bailed at the first sign of him talking about sex because it literally went to the extent of every online chat we had involving sex. Long story short, if I declined, he was abusive - mentally and verbally.\n\nThe last straw was when I had to go to another country (which he made up his mind to hate because there's a negative connotation to people from the said country) for work for a few days. On finding out that I was invited to my friend's house for dinner and that they took care of me when I got severely ill from the food, he blew up my phone nonstop, made suicidal threats with me on video call (by driving fast on the road), faked being fired from his job, and then accused my friend of RAPING ME.\n\nCalled off the relationship there and then, blocked all calls and messages, attempts to contact me, etc. He tried to take a flight to my home, threatened revenge porn (though I never knew he took any photos of me that were indecent), sent me links to porn videos he jacked off to that 'reminded him of me'.\n\nThe worst part? The country he's from makes anyone virtually related to the ruler almost immune to any form of prosecution, so I couldn't report him to the cops in his country.  He's the ruler's great-grand-nephew or something. Goodness knows if I had actually married him or visited him one more time... would've had hell.",

Our first hangout we decided to meet at our local mall. So I get to the mall and wait around for her to text me that she's there so we can meet up. She texts me and says she's here and I look out the window and see this girl sitting on a bench with very few similarities to her Facebook photo, now not to sound like a prick but I'm not into bigger women it's just not a preference of mine, this girl was taller than me face looked way different from her photos and I was debating on calling my ride to get me and tell her something came up. I didn't have the heart to do that cause i know I'd be really sad if someone did that to me so I hung out with her for about an hour or 2 and she took me to all these stores told me stories about past friendships like how she'd been betrayed, just kinda oversharing a lot of personal information with me. We had talked online about cuddling and sorts and I'm very glad she didn't try to touch me once the entire encounter because I would've cried. Look I'm sorry she was really ugly, I finally got home and never spoke to her again. Moral of the story, make sure you know what you're really talking to because snapchat filters are deceptive.\n\nAlso a few years later I found out that she had been a friend of a friend and they had a falling out and this girl had been stalking her social media and posting about her and she even still tries to subtly get my attention with Instagram dm's and even tinder cause I'm still searching boys. I saw her and swiped nope and saw in the people who liked me category and it was her photo but blurred but I could tell it was her.

We have hail and ride public transport in my city.\n\nIt was getting dark, but not late, where I was standing was dimly lit.  I noticed I was getting looked at, I thought to myself, “they probably think you’re a prostitute, go and stand close to that orange seller, she has a light.  So, I moved.  \n\nTwo or three young men who were part of the reason I moved also moved with me.  I sighed inwardly.  I was contemplating moving again when a station wagon came speeding from my left, the street I just came off.\n\nThe car was going so fast that when he hit an oncoming car, one of them went up in the air and flew across the road landing exactly where I was standing into drains by the side of the road, which didn’t have any covers.\n\nI remember thinking as I looked at the car, that would have broken me in half, and I would have died.\nCue lots of shouting and people telling me how lucky I was.  The young men were thanking me, for making them move. \n\nSo, a few minutes later, I get into a taxi and they join me.  I was like no, let me out of here.  They went from thanking me and giving me money to calling me names.  It was surreal, even now 20 odd years later, I still get shivers when I remember.  \n\nPlus the week before, I was walking down the road to buy bread, and someone drove into me.  He picked me up and dropped me down, I was underneath his car, I could see the front tire coming towards my head, I remember laying my head down on the wet road, ready to die and he managed to swerve, thankfully away from my head. \n\nSomeone else beside me managed to jump into one of those open drains by the side of the road.",

I was all the way in the left (fast) lane and hardly anyone else was on the road. The road was 4 lanes. Typically I don’t start getting into the right (one of the exit) lane until I’m about a mile and a half from my exit. But ten miles before my exit I thought “why the hell not” and moved over early. After two miles I suddenly start approaching cars that are at a complete stop. I start slowing down and realize all of them were at a dead stop because of traffic and I wondered if I had to get over. At this point I’m so upset because I know this would make me miss my flight and I felt horrible at the idea of wasting my bfs money (he had only been together for a couple of months). I decided to stay in my lane and I start passing them. For about six miles I pass them before coming up to the front. Then as I’m watching the traffic I realize the lane all the way in the opposite side of the road, knowing it’ll be impossible to get over I start trying my luck and start moving over then and there despite the fact that my lane is moving the quickest still. Suddenly a semi lets me in and before I can move lanes again, this one starts moving fast and the one I was just in stops. Turns out I was in the only open lane. Two were blocked off from an accident and one was blocked off for construction. I got out of that traffic in about 5 minutes and made it just in time for my flight.

Apparently no one wanted to go and I was told I said “if I hit it, will you all?” And I never made it apparently as I was told I hit either a rock or the front truck of the board gave out because it looked like I jumped off Head first. Friends called 911, I threw up that dominos pizza, I was flown to a major hospital over an hour and a half away (driving) and I woke up from a coma 7 days later in a neck brace dumbfounded as to where I was, and even more hurt that my undefeated Kentucky wildcats (alma matter) lost to Wisconsin in the final 4 and I never got to see it. I don’t remember any of it. \n\nNone of it. The accident, the idea of long boarding, and pretty much most of my freshmen year. The girl I was dating for about 2 months, didn’t remember her and that didn’t work out ultimately, as you might predict. Then came the road to recovery from the multiple concussions, blood clot formed on the brain and I gained like 100 lbs from being limited to what I could do my first few months back. Ultimately lost like 70-80ish lbs, still got some more I haven’t been able to shake haha. \n\nBlood clot gone thanks to steroid Tylenol’s I was given (although I definitely didn’t take all they gave me cause they sucked) Discovered weed for the first time about 2 months in. Those friends I grew up with from freshmen year of high school who I longboarded with, (who I apparently asked if they were ok in a state of shock I guess, I found out after reading group texts when the accident happened) no longer friends haha. \n\nI was told I should be dead when I woke up from a coma in a neck brace and catheter in my piece (IT HURT!!) never long boarded again (still skate though) and found my way in a new group of friends for the rest of my life. \n\nAll because I didn’t want to wear a fucking helmet hahaha. You bet your ass I’m that “old” guy in the neighborhood at 25 getting the kids to wear helmets.",

So young me just started make-believe in the front seat of the car that I was actually in a race, and I was switching gears of the actual car while doing that. We were on a highway, so naturally my whole family yelled at me and I stopped for a while. 4 hours after leaving, we stopped for lunch since I had started to cry out of hunger (I had a REAL problem with non-homemade food, so we avoided it as best as we could) . After around an hour from leaving that place with miraculously no counter-reaction from my body, I noticed that everyone in the back seat was sleeping, and I decided to have some fun again with my imagination. And, so while pretending to be a famous racer again, I shifted the gear two steps down. We were going at around 80 km/h so naturally the car gave a huge jolt. The car was steered sharp to the left and was stopped right after, on the side. I thought this was it, I'm dead now. Slowly stepping out to face my impending doom, I was instead hugged by everyone, even my brother who openly admitted he didn't like doing that. They were thanking me, saying that I could get whatever I wanted. Turns out, that even my dad, who was driving the car, had started to feel drowsy. When I did that, I was unaware that the car was slowly going into the opposite lane (It was a 2 lane road without a divider). That huge jolt woke up my dad and he steered sharply or else we would've hit a truck.",

One Friday these rival factions got into a fight outside and both sides were talking about \"coming back and handling things later\". So literally the next week I'm on my way to the club with some random chick and my car clunks out. Its like the distributor cap and coil went out and the car started jerking. As I think about it, actually it started doing this around 2 weeks beforehand. Anyway, the sputter got so bad I pulled over at a gas station. \n\nLong story, a friend had to come and pull the car. So we went back to my apartment instead and grabbed her car. Then we decided it was too late so we went to iHop. Around 45 mins into the meal a bunch of people come into iHop and they're talking about some shooting at a club. Come to find out, the two rival sides got into a massive shootout and several people were shot with 3 being killed. The next morning I find out it was an all out drive by instead of a shootout. In the exact area where I always park, most of the bullet holes were found which is front sidewalk right corner of the club. I remember this area because it was hard to see from the street and when I was cheating in my day I would park there so my other girl wouldn't see my car of she rode by with her friends or whatever.\n\nThey found 45 bullet holes along the side of that area. At the time the shooting happened,,I would have been sitting there on the cellular lying to my other girl about where I was. I know this because I arrived at this club exactly the same time every week and spent 10 mins on my phone with my other chick lying about my whereabouts. I was very tactical and foolish and a cheater back then. \n\nNeedless to say, I probably literally dodged a bullet.",

My boss overheard and basically made fun of me for being concerned and said I should man up and rub some mud on it. \n\nI ignored that and went to my doctor. Doctor couldn’t figure out what was up, did blood work, still couldn’t figure it out referred me to a nerve specialist. Nerve specialist does some electrical tests, thinks it’s a pinched nerve. Got referred to Physiotherapy, went a few times, and the physiotherapist said it was really weird the nerve didn’t react. Then had a follow up with the nerve specialist and he runs the test again. My calf is much weaker this time, and he books an urgent MRI (urgent in Canada still means like 5 months wait). \n\nI go for the MRI and the next day I get a call from the nurse saying I need to go back the next day for another MRI and the doctor will be calling me to explain. Doctor calls and says he usually doesn’t do this over the phone, but I have a tumour in my spine. Go through the whole surgery process, Tumour is removed and benign. My calve is still weak to this day due to nerve endings being cut off from the tumour growth. \n\nHad I not got bad shin splints that triggered the weakness, or listened to my asshole boss, or any of the various doctors I saw just written it off as a pinched nerve, the tumour would have kept growing and either paralyzed or killed me.",

The first two things he asked me whenever he first spoke to me were if I were single and if I liked anybody. I knew where his intentions lied but he was nice.\n\nEventually, after a few days he asked me out. I told him no thank you but that we could still be friends. He agreed but wouldn't let up and kept being very weird. He would still flirt with me, would call me beautiful, and didn't like it whenever I was around other guys.\n\nI then found out that he was very abusive towards his ex, cheated on her, and then wrecked her relationship with her new boyfriend.\n\nI started to distance myself from him, but one day he invited me over to his house. I was busy that day and did not want to be around him, so I told him no thank you. He was pretty persistent but eventually gave up.\n\nI found out that he ended up moving away. I didn't have much of an opinion on it.\n\nUntil I found out why he moved away.\n\nHe and his mother were living in a tent. They were living in a tent because they used to live with his sister until he tried to *murder* her and she kicked them both out.\n\nHe invited me over to his \"house\" not long after being kicked out.\n\nI told somebody he knew about what I find out and how he asked me to come over and they straight up told me that if I had gone over there then there's a big chance that he would have tried to rape me, murder me, or both.\n\nNuke dodged.",

On December 22nd 2018 me and my boyfriend (also father of our daughter, who lived with my mom by the way) were sleeping and I'm a bit of a heavy sleeper, well the phone rang early in the morning around  5-6am and he woke up and answered it. It was our dealer saying he got new stuff and wanted us to try it and see how it was, he would give us some for free. Well my boyfriend got up and waited for him. Normally he would wake me up too but seeing how we didn't have anything and I was sleeping I imagine he didn't want to wake me up until he got there so I wouldn't have to wait for him while being sick. Dealer gets there gives him some he draws up  two shots one for me one for him. I imagine he was going to do his then come get me but that never happened. It was  straight  fentanyl and hadnt been cut yet and it immediately killed him. If he had woke me up that morning we both would have died. I don't remember that morning or that entire day. I woke up the next day in the psych unit at the hospital. It's been almost three years and I still don't know what happened that morning, I don't know who called 911 I don't know if I saw him I don't know if I did cpr I don't know if it was the paramedics that woke me up. If I try to remember I can't. It's like that whole day is blacked out. I don't remember my mom picking me up and taking me to the hospital. When I woke up in the hospital I had no idea where I was or why I was there. All I did know is something bad happened. So even though I didn't get clean immediately after that I did eventually. And I still like to think that he saved my life that day by not asking me up. I miss him everyday. He was the love of my life. He was so smart, and kind, and loving. And he always did the right thing. He just had a hole in his heart that he tried to fill. He tried so hard so many times to quit but he could never just walk away from it. I love him so much and i would give anything to change what happened. I look at our daughter and she looks just like him. The only good thing is I'm clean today I have a house, a car, a job, my  daughter, and our  two cats and a dog. I love my life today and I'm happy but I lost a part of me that day and I cant ever get it back. He saved my life by giving his. I love him.",

I wanted to be his friend ofc because I was a social butterfly. He just so happens to have his seat assigned next of me. I start talking to him on the first day, really great guy. I start to have feelings for him. I’m walking out of the restroom one day and he’s staring and straight up runs into a wall. Everyone was teasing him, he made every excuse in the book. He and I were good friends but I mentioned it and he blew up, absolutely SNAPPED. My friend Sarah and I just kind of ignore him and go back to our work. The next day at lunch, he’s sitting across from us because for some god awful reason we had assigned seats at lunch. We try to start small talk but he is pissed. He starts arguing, and like the fourth grader I was, I argued back. Man says “Y’know, I just had the best thought!” And ofc Sarah had to ask just wtf his thought was. He responds, “I just thought about kidnapping you both and slowly shutting Sarah’s neck as ((my name)) watches.” We tell the teacher and she sits us far away from him. Not exactly the tactical nuke I dodged, only half way. Well, here comes middle school, and we had no classes together, great! During red ribbon week we had a competition to decorate a ribbon with our name on it and put it on our lockers. I decorate mine all pretty and sweets themed. So I put my ribbon on my locker, the next day there’s a note in my locker. 😟 it was from the boy- he was saying that he was gonna kidnap me because only he could have me, I was freaking out. Needless to say, I’ve moved since then and it’s much better.",

He just came back from a vet visit and was nervous, then accidentally i stepped on one of his paws and he reacted aggressively, trying to bite me. Now, i don't remember if i was already turned with only  the side of my face towards him or if i instinctively turned when he snapped his head, but i managed to avoid getting bitten in the face. He did bit my ear and tore a significant chunk of it off. Had to get it reattached, and now years later you can't even tell anything has happened unless you feel behind my ear, where there is a small lump of scar tissue. I never really thought much of it at the time but now looking back i see how ridiculously lucky i got. If he bit me that hard anywhere on my face, i could've ended up with anything from a big permanent scar to a half-missing nose or lip. \n\nActually, it's a miracle that i don't have any type of significant injury on my face/body/brain seeing how i got into at least 5-6 of what you could call \"significant accidents\" by the age of 10. Got 2nd degree burns on my whole chest caused by boiling water, was involved in a car accident where two people were significantly injured, a metal pole fell into my head, etc. and all i have to show for it is a couple of burn scars on my foot (unrelated to the boiling water accident) and a small scar on my brow where hair doesn't grow. Oh and a bigger,uglier scar on the top of my head caused by the metal pole that is completely covered by hair, praying i don't start balding soon.",

After minutes of searching, we realized all the good bikes were sold out. \n\nWe were driving home, it was daytime, and we started heading quite fast downhill. My mom, who is scared going fast on roads, asked my dad to slightly slow down. He did, thank god, because out of nowhere this van rushes to the middle of the road, causing my dad to slam on the emergency breaks. I remember the screeching of the tires and the car trying to slow down, but barely doing so as we were traveling down hill.\n\nThe emergency breaks did somewhat work but we still ended up crashing into the side of the van. The van flipped over and our car stopped from the immediate impact. My parents had slightly injured themselves but were thankfully fine. \n\nThe guy whose car had crashed into us had his van turned upside down and was hanging on by his seatbelt.

If my mom had not told my dad to slow down while he was going downhill, I think one of us would not have made it out that day. \n\nAlso, our car ended up being totaled and the company said there was no way they could repair it.

The experience was a bit scary, but hey, I was ok!  \n\nWe got on the bus they use to take the rafters back to the starting point.  The road is a bit curvy and hilly.  A pickup truck careens around a curve, sideswipes the bus, and flips end over end into the trees.  When it comes to rest, the top of the cab is level with the bed.  The driver did not survive.  \n\nWe get to the campground after a bit... the day was a little stressful for all involved... and my dad selects a campsite.  I have a bit of a hissy fit because the site is near the latrine and it smells.  I push to move to a site farther from the bathrooms.  My dad's not happy about it, but finally agrees.  We switch sites, set up camp and it starts to rain, so we turn in early. It's a noisy night with  lots of thunder, lightning, and rain.  We hear and feel a couple trees falling, but we're tired so we pretty much sleep through most of it.  The next morning, we wake up to a bunch of emergency vehicles across the campground.  Turns out the site we had chosen first was where the trees had fallen.  Two campers were crushed in their tents.  Never been so glad to be leery of bad smells.",

I wasn’t dealing with that and he was a sweet guy so I told him that him talking to his ex’s was a no go and she needed to be blocked or else I wasn’t continuing any further , he made a huge deal about it and said that it was just underwear . I told him he can choose the person who’s an ex for a reason or the person he was currently with and he chose me . Together for a while and we started to talk explicitly over text , he gets in trouble and his mother reads all the messages and we weren’t allowed to see each other for a while . He then sneaks his moms phone and logs into his Instagram to tell me he had cut my initials into his arm and even sent me a picture , 15 year old me thought this was normal . Time goes on and he was dumping all of his mental problems onto me while i was in my 9th grade year of high school and my grades were dropping dramatically because i constantly had to talk to him or else he’d think the worst . I finally had enough of it when all of my teachers noticed it was an everyday thing that I had to text him cause he was crying about something . So I told my mom to text his mom and tell him I was leaving him because I just couldn’t do it anymore , later in the day I find out that he had to be put on suicide watch because he had passed out and was freaking out because of it all . He then texts me after he’s home and tells me he’s sitting in front of a box of razor blades and was gonna “ do it “ after that I decided to take him back because I didn’t want him to hurt himself . He did all of this stuff to me but then after he came back from a church camp he “ found god “ and broke up with me because I smoked a cigarette 😐so yeah that’s how I dodged the biggest bullet of my life",

            "text": "Sunday nov 14 2021 was the start of a massive Mother Nature shut down in the history of British Columbia. I accidentally slept 3 hours in while visiting my long distance gf on Vancouver island and I live in the okanagan valley. I had therefore planned to make the 1pm ferry out of nanaimo to horseshoe bay Vancouver. When I left her house it had been raining pretty hard for several days already but the rain got worse the further down Island I went from CR towards Nanaimo. \n\nWhen I got to nanaimo I was greeted with 2 of 3 ferries down for maintenance and about 1 mile of cars backed up down an adjacent road waiting for the ferry. Little did I know that was the beginning of how it saved my life and for many others. \n\nI missed the 1pm ferry and was told I would be on the 845pm ferry at the latest (no.. I wasn’t…) out of nanaimo. While waiting for the 1pm ferry to unload, I overheard some travellers talking about how highway 5 named the coquihalla highway was shut down due to a mud slide. Didn’t think anything of it as it’s the 2nd biggest highway between Vancouver greater area and the rest of canada and that it would be cleared very quickly. \n\nI ended up missing the 1pm ferry and thought I’ll make the next one, well I didn’t. Long story short I sat for 9.5 hours and got the 1030pm ferry. By then, a whole world of issues arose while I was napping in the truck. \n\nHighway 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 93, 99 all shut down due to heavy rains, mud slides, avalanches and wash outs. I was frantically trying to figure out the best route to take back but there was none. We were cut off completely by ground. I had a bunch of tools, no passport or advanced drivers license so I couldn’t by pass through Washington state or fly. When I got to Surrey it was raining really hard and I was hitting all the puddles and pools on the highway trying to make it to my uncle’s house off Whatcom exit in abbotsford which later flooded almost 7 feet over the course of 5 days. \n\nWhen I got to his place around 2 am, I had heard that 5 bridges on highway 5 have collapsed, highway 1 between hope and chilliwack was flooded and covered by a mud slide, along with further north to Spences Bridge (access to merritt and kamloops and cache creek). Highway 7 and 9 bypass to Hope was washed out, flooded and covered by mud. \n\nMy uncle told me if I had gotten on the 1pm ferry. I woulda been turned around in hope from taking highway 5 to take any other highway. \n\nOver the course of 36 hours, a months worth of rain fell and people were stranded in their cars between slides, wash outs and floods for up to 28 hours before SAR and the Canadian military flew them out by helicopter. I could have been one of those stranded Motorists! Even worse, unfortunately 4 people have been found dead, 1 is still missing 5 days later fearing that this person is also dead. My friends got to Whistler before the Sea To Sky highway shut down. Some people went to pemberton to bypass the lower mainland and got hit with avalanches, mud slides and wash outs… highway 3 got flooded and a few wash outs and a couple mud slides between hope and Osoyoos. 5A to aspen grove from Princeton had a mudslide aswell leaving the only way out of Princeton was keremeos to Kaleden to Penticton. \n\nBy Tuesday morning, Merritt and Princeton were under water; Lytton, After being Burnt off the map 3 months ago, now flooded and all highways cut off in or out. Highway 1 to Spences Bridge had many closures and hope was cut off completely for days. \n\nI sat watching out the window of my uncles house (off Whatcom road) as the sumas prairies became a lake once Again! Although some people took some fun over there riding boats along the highway, many farmers were trying to save their livestock and helping eachother get out of the prairie. Wednesday hit and there was an RV dealer that caught fire burning most of the RV’s and close to 70 F150s.. the world felt like it was ending. Refugees were sent to kamloops and Kelowna and stores were getting picked dry fearing no food or gas would be coming through but the commercial routes for that were from alberta or the USA. \n\nMaking matters worse, after the nooksack River burst the banks, a dyke blew north of abbotsford leaving the pump station to hold back the sumas Fraser River from filling the valley and the mayor feared that any of the pumps would fail and it would be over.\n\nI had to stay 5 days in abbotsford before making my way to highway 7 through mission before I could get to highway 3 as they opened Yesterday at 3pm. Left at 930 got home in Kelowna by 330 am. \n\nIf I hadn’t slept in Sunday, my truck would still be out there on one of those highways as I wait for construction crews to clear a road out. Even worse I could have died depending where on what highway at what time I was at. \n\nI hope everyone affected by this force of Mother Nature is doing great and staying safe! Never since the coquihalla opened, has every major highway shut down all at once. Never. Stay safe guys. \n\nThose interested in checking it out. Google Coquihalla wash out or closures. Flooding in the lower mainland BC. You could also check out DriveBC’s website to look at the highway map and see closures. BC highway cams aswell will show you 15 min increments of photos taken of each highway. Many pictures and videos on social media of this force of Mother Nature taking back the lake we took from her 🙄",

Fun one is number 2.\n\nIn college a little over 10 years ago I was driving across state lines NJ -> NY around 1am helping a friend move some stuff from his apt back home. I had a quarter ounce of pot in the glove. I was bringing it because we were going to hang out getting stoned and play video games for the weekend while his parents were away before I drove back. I had it in the glove because I was an idiot.\n\nMy friend had a big board thing in my trunk that didn't quite fit and meant I had to have the trunk open and tied down most of the way. I made it through about 4.5 hours of the 5 hour drive no problems. I was in the last 30 minutes thinking I'm free and clear driving the speed limit on residential NY roads not a car in sight when the red and blues appear in my rear-view. Pulled over. Sure enough, he's wondering what the deal is with my trunk. My license is in my wallet, but my reg and insurance is in-- you guessed it-- the glove. And it's under the pot because I just threw the pot in there without thinking.\n\nHere's the move. BEFORE reaching to get my reg, in my best \"I'm not doing anything illegal\" impression, I casually mentioned that I thought he was pulling me over because of a headlight that was out, and motion to my headlight. This freaking guy WALKS AWAY FROM MY WINDOW TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR to look at my headlight and in that moment I can get my reg and insurance out of the glove without him seeing the quarter ounce inside. I should emphasize, my comment about the headlight was just nervous banter and NOT me trying to Jedi mind trick him into walking away. I go on to explain about my friend moving and give enough specific detail about the town for him to send me on my way without a ticket. We smoked the whole quarter ounce that weekend.\n\n...\n\n\nOkay second one, and this is nice and short and silly: a couple months back my girl's grandparents stopped by to see our new apartment after a truly lovely evening out getting dinner with them. I work in visual arts, so they walk to my drawing table to see what I've been working on over my shoulder. I pull out my computer to show how I start a piece on paper and finish it digitally. When my screen wakes up, it is sitting on my latest pornhub adventure. All the worst stuff literally right there, mere feet from these wonderful old sweethearts' eyes. I have a small heart attack and look behind me thinking this is the end, only to see that while their bodies are pointed at me, their heads are actually turned towards my girlfriend (who also is not looking in my direction) mercifully holding their attention in conversation. Misdirection seems to be my guardian angel. I quickly close out of everything using that precious half second, and the night proceeds to be a wonderful evening. I told my girlfriend what happened after they left and she cackled with glee like I don't think I've ever seen her do before.",

About a week after surgery there were planned military games where a few thousand people took part from different units (special forces, infantry, tanks, artillery etc). During the games, I was supposed to be part of a (special forces) 3 person recon unit (my CO, me and my pair), where we'd always be 100-200y ahead of the rest of our platoon. As I was on sick leave, Mike (for my platoon) took my spot in the recon unit.  \nAt the end of the second day morning exercise (which included having to occupy a cliff while being supported by artillery and mortars, my unit was walking back to camp on a side unpaved road. That road was also used by a group of Cascavel 12ton 6-wheeled armored recon vehicles/tanks.   \nThe driver of the 3rd in line vehicle (who unbeknownst to us had threatened the CO during a serious argument the night before), while en-route, turned the tank toward our CO, accelerated and then proceeded to change course the last second. This was probably in an attempt to scare the CO...with a 12TON tank...on an unpaved road.  \nAs soon as he was about 5-10 yards from my recon unit, he tried to realign the tank back to its original course at no avail. The dirt under the wheels caved in causing the tank to drift diagonally scraping the CO on the arm, shoving my pair on the shoulder knocking him slightly off-course and going over his ankle while it smashed Mike on the back of the head, knocked him forward on the ground and just rolled over his torso with all three wheels.\n\nOne of my friends (who was an artillery lieutenant, not taking part in the specific games) called me at home and asked if my company was taking part in the games. I confirmed and in a very shocked voice said \"there's been an accident. turn your TV on\". \n\nAs soon as I turned the TV on, the medic chopper was landing at the hospital and he was on a stretcher being rushed to the ER. As soon as the stretcher was off the chopper, the first doctor attempted to perform CPR. With the doctor's first chest thrust, he took a step back in shock as Mike's entire upper body jiggled like jello. Mike's dad passed away 3 months later after a stroke due to severe depression.\n\nStill haunts me to this today  \nRIP Mike 01/14/1999",

            "text": "tldr; i nearly slept with an unhinged girl that threatened me over nothing and i unknowingly slept with her friend a week later.\n\nokay just a heads up, i was also a dumb bitch on my part, in my defence, i was desperate haha. this also happened a couple years ago so the details aren’t as clear as i remember it. so i matched with this girl on tinder (before i got banned lol) that i’ve already met beforehand when i was out clubbing to see if it’ll lead to something. we talked for a bit, planned a date. my desperate lesbian ass wanted to meet her asap but she said she wanted to wait another week to get to know me better before going on a date and i respected her wishes. this is where i basically should’ve stopped talking to her. she opened up about her criminal charges for jumping a cop and how she cheated on her gf from her previous relationship. i didn’t think much of it as i thought she was owning up to her past mistakes. so fast forward to our supposed date, i was literally about to get ready and she bailed on me just so she could catch up with some friends as a last minute plan, went on about how much of an asshole she is and that’s just how she is. mind you i was already having a rough day and the date was one thing i was looking forward to so i basically cried and she made me feel bad for getting upset bc apparently it’s making her look more like a bad guy. that same night, me, my sister and her bf go to the city for some pancakes bc my sister was craving pancakes and the place was open 24 hours. the huge mistake is letting her know that i was at the city bc she was going out to drink somewhere close by. she begged me to come out for drinks with her but i kept declining as i had work the next day and i thought she’d leave it at that until me, my sister and her bf are going back home. she calls me and demanded, not even asked, that we pick her up when we already left the city and just a few blocks away from my house now. i told her we couldn’t pick her up as we already left and to use the last bit of her battery percentage to book herself an uber back to her place and before she hung up on me, she told me she was done with me and i don’t think much of it until (trigger warning now) she blows my phone up the next day while i was at work showing me bruises all over her thighs and her at the hospital and told me that she was raped by a friend that same night. i felt like i was at fault bc this wouldn’t have happened if we picked her up. the next night, she went out again for drinks and she begged me if she could crash at my place. i said yes because i didn’t want her to get hurt again. she comes over at my place really drunk and soaked in her beer so i gave her a set of clean clothes to change into. we lay in bed, she started telling me all the details of what happened the other night and i just laid there and couldn’t say anything bc i wasn’t sure if it was my place at all to talk. after she finished venting, my friend called (actually, a potential sneaky link) and i answered and told her that i have someone at my house rn so i couldn’t talk. she was a social butterfly so she started a conversation with her and cracked up a harmless joke, then the girl just lost her shit at her and threatened to bash my friend. she ended the call and she started getting up on me about how i didn’t defend her but i was trying to see what my friend said wrong. she now went on about how she’s going to go back out to drink and i told her she’s not gonna do that as she’ll get hurt again and i told her to book an uber back to her home instead. she goes back home and i call my friend back to apologise to her for what happened just then and suddenly, the girl started blowing up my phone. i wasn’t answering bc i was still talking to my friend and i just told my friend the details. the girl demanded that i answer her or “it’s not gonna end well” for me and she knows where i live. yes. she just threatened me for not answering her calls and then she started going on about how everyone just leaves her and accused me of not wanting to get with her anymore bc she got raped when that literally wasn’t even the reason and i never even stated that i didn’t want her. my friend kinda backed up my squiggly spine and stood up to her about how manipulative she’s been towards me the whole time and it ended as that. i just feel like adding this to show how “small” the lesbian community is. i slept with another girl and told her this incident. we exchange socials and saw that we’re both friends with this girl on facebook so i told her that she’s the girl i was talking about. she felt bad that the girl bailed on me so she could hang out with her. again, it’s been a couple years now since that incident, she now has a gf that i’m kinda concerned about and i hope she’s treating her well. i forgot to add a bit of detail that she has bpd which explains it but it doesn’t really excuse her behaviour.",

He just beeped and swerved behind my dad and flashing his lights at us, my dad was PISSED, he just floored it and left, everyone was beeping at the van becuase he was in the middle lane going 20,as we left the highway and entered another, a Hyundai elantra going 110 hit the bus in the back and there was a loud bang, if we were behind that bus still, we definitely would've been in the situation of injuring poeple behind us.

When we were standing in line, a man came through and stood behind us, waiting. I had this horrible feeling about this guy and told my boyfriend we need to leave and we will get food somewhere else. But at this point we are next in line and he orders our food. I couldn’t shake this feeling about this man. I was just scared? We pay for our food and leave. Once we get in the car I drive off explaining that I just had a feeling that the guy was going to do something horrible and I didn’t want to be there if anything were to happen. We went back to the cabin and forgot about it. That next morning, we get a call from family members asking if we are okay. They sent us an article online saying that there was a shooting in the neighborhood where the cabin was. I opened the article and it shows a picture of the man that was standing behind us in Subway. He broke into a house down the road and shot someone in the head. I think about this whenever I pass this Subway/Cabin area now.",
