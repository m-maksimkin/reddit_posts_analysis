            "text": "It would depend on a few factors...\n\n1) Depends on the home. Retirement homes and nursing homes, at least where I live, are *very* different - retirement homes are for those who can live pretty independently (i.e. can wash themselves, feed themselves, toilet themselves, etc.) while nursing homes are for people who need more care, such as washing, dressing, toileting, medication administration, etc. Therefore, interacting with people in a retirement home would be vastly different from those in a nursing home.\n\n2) Depends on the expectation of hours and types of activities expected of me. I work 12-hour shifts. On working days, I don't have \"a few hours\" to spare. However, I could drop down to a part-time job or one with less demanding hours if I didn't have to pay rent. Also, am I just expected to hang out and interact with the residents or do I actually have to do work, like washing people or cleaning?\n\n3) What are my living arrangements like? Can I bring my cat? Can I expect a reasonable amount of privacy? Can I lock my door? People with dementia tend to wander and I know some can go into the wrong room and rummage through other people's things....or worse.\n\n4) Is it only rent-free or am I provided other things, such as access to amenities, meals, etc.? If I don't have to pay for most of my food or pay hydro fees, then that would just sweeten the deal further and make the arrangement more appealing.\n\nOVERALL, I'd probably go for it as long as I only had to hang out with the residents (and NOT have to do actual work), especially if it were just a retirement home. I work as an RN. I don't mind the elderly. I can deal with most behaviours (but as I said, as long as I can lock my door). Death? Sure it can be sad, but death is not the worst thing in the world. For a lot of people, especially the very old, it's a relief.\n\nA lot of older people have so many stories to tell. I once volunteered at a nursing home and there was one lady who would carry secret military information in WW2. She would tell us of all the interesting people she met, too. One nursing home resident I looked after was a former nurse. As a nursing student (at the time), she would tell me what it was like to be a nurse when she was younger - a far different experience than mine. I love hearing what the world was like decades ago.\n\nNot technically a nursing home resident, but my dad has told me things that fascinate me. He remembers going to school before ballpoint pens were the norm. He said they would take turns refilling the ink wells at everyone's desk in the classroom. He told me how they practiced handwriting intensively and the teacher would correct them on things like the slant of their letters. He said getting his COVID vaccine brought back memories of him waiting in line for the newly-released polio vaccine. He watched the moon landing and gave money to Terry Fox as he ran through Toronto. All of this happened before I was even born.\n\nObviously, this would not be something I would do forever - it would just be for a couple of years, perhaps, while I saved some money to move into my own place.",

Suppose your tent is $700 a month (low, but not unreasonable for a young person with a roommate). That amount divided by an estimated 30 days per month is about $23 per day. If you had to spend minimum 3 hours per day to earn those $23 dollars, you would be getting paid a maximum rate of $7.66/ hour, which is a miserable hourly rate.

I might not be able to have that experience with them but if there’s a way I could share that with a resident who doesn’t have grandkids or is unable to see theirs or just someone who wants to pass down a part of their lives to someone else before their time comes I think that would be nice",

It basically means that you're a trusted person that handles someones economy, food purchases, bank accounts etc. Now, I'm not expecting you would handle that for the elderly, but every person who's ever been a \"Good man\" service for someone who needs that (I'm talking about Sweden for our part), has the suspicions from their families of fraud hanging over them every waking hour of their life.\n\nElderly tends to become attached to the ones they hang out (just like you do), they will listen to your stories and your wishes too, and not to seldomly - if you get well aquainted enough, they would want to help you out, maybe they will offer you a loan, buy you the dream item of your life, follow your investment ideas and whatnot, just to show some love in return.\n\nThis ALWAYS leads to a bad path, because typically family members that don't take care of their own and leave their elders to a nursery home - want's their elderly to be treated like kings for free, and expect to inherit all of their belongings (make no mistake, people are GREEDY by nature), and I might  be playing the devils advocate here, but questions about your relations to the elderly you hang out with - WILL come up, whether your are 100 percent innocent or not, that is fully besides the point ....because every family will be as suspicous about you as they would be if you where hanging out with their kid as their sports coach or caretaker.\n\nCan you handle the smell? Can you handle changing diapers on someone at that place? Because even if you don't have to do these things at all, it will come up eventually when staff is...well understaffed as they always are.\n\nThere's a fine line here, you might be the retirement center HERO for all that we know, but you will be under constant suspicion by their families and basically everyone. The senile and demented are the worst ones.\n\nYou risk being accused of something before  you know if. Who are people to believe, you? The helper with good will and good intentions, or their own family member, however demented, they will always chose family, and greed will always lead them to be suspicious of anyone, even if it's just something they didn't understand or \"thought\" of in their own imagination.\n\nIf it's for a short time - say 1 year, it's a great learning experience for you, and you may even end up with future friends (provided their families aren't total nut-cases).\n\nBut you will do a lot of stuff, heavy lifting of older people, helping them out and into bed, washing and bathing, running errands.\n\nJust so you are aware of what you'd be risking...other than that, go for it.",

Most of the people here are very old but are generally in pretty good health. Services provided typically go no further than helping to manage prescription meds and helping people bathe and dress. The average stay here is typically about 2 years before they either die or require too much care and move to a nursing home.\n\n* Nursing Home - Long term hospital (average age around 82). Typically entirely paid for by Medicare and/or health insurance. Doors are often left open 24/7. You are much more likely to be assigned multiple people to a room. Food is typically delivered to the room because most of the residents are not mobile. Sometimes people will stay in one for long term recovery of a surgery that requires intensive care but for the most part this is very sick people just waiting around to die.

Now, imagine that feces hurler and/or syringe wielding maniac is HIV positive with a bad staph infection.  And don't you dare defend yourself or try to restrain them because it's a federal crime and you'll end up in federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison of you do. Also, physical restraints, even seat belts in wheel chairs and bed rails are against the law to use. Same with chemical restraints like tranquilizer drugs.  Think you can just ignore the offenders and walk away? Nope, that's against the law, too; it's called \"neglect.\" \n\nNone of these people are ever going to get better/well because there are no cures for dementia, antisocial personality disorder, schizophrenia, or the myriad of other ailments they suffer from. The facility is run-down and dilapidated, and because everyone is on Medicare and Medicaid, the facility receives the lowest rate of compensation for their services, and in turn, provides the lowest legally acceptable standards of care. The employees are overworked, short-staffed, and underpaid. Literally no one wants to be there--neither residents nor staff. And you can't hire anyone to help, or at least not anyone with skills and options because the facility's reputation within the community is abysmal.\n\nThe only way you could convince me to take OP's deal is if my next best option were homelessness, just like the unlucky bastards who already live there.",

Some of them go right into college and end up changing majors a bunch of times, others take some time off school first to work before they decide.\n\nSo you set up a program for young people, starting at 16 part time and becoming full time at 18 if they decide to take time off before college, and staying part time at any time they are taking classes in college.\n\n* Rent for these young people is covered, in a location near their school and job\n* Cover basic food expenses\n* Health care is fully included\n* Tuition, fees, books etc is all covered regardless if it's a degree related to what they are working in or not\n\nI'd like for it to be a part of a federal jobs program; all the things we value as a society would be included. Construction projects, hospice care, climate programs, parks and national parks maintenance, social services, healthcare entry-level jobs.\n\nImagine if every industry had a jobs program that offered every \"entry-level\" job that required 0 years experience because it actually was intended for entry-level workers.

They really make you take stock of your life when you're in for a visit. It always made me grateful that I was young and healthy, and that I had the option to leave at the end of the day. I would make eye contact with the residents and just think they were my age at one point, they were able-bodied at one point. They were raising families, helping shape the future, contributing to society. Then I would think one day this might be me. I might not be able to take care of myself. I might need this type of help.\n\nThe other thing that the nursing homes make you think about is your own mortality. I recall one time glancing into a room, and seeing an elderly man being put into a body bag. I kind of just stood there and thought this guy had dreams, he probably loved and was loved, all the things that he experienced in his life, just gone. I then thought that at one point that's going to be me. At one point I will take my last breath, and I will be the one going into the body bag. \n\nI also got to meet some pretty cool people. I made time to visit with other residents while visiting my grandmother. I listened to WWII stories from one older gentleman. I got to hear what it was like to march with Martin Luther King JR. It was like a history book coming to life. Their eyes would light up when talking about their children and their grandchildren. Most of these people are the same as a young person, their bodies have betrayed them. They still like to laugh, play games, and just have a good time.

I know. But I live with my own folks now, and I'm pretty comfortable. Nursing homes can be pretty iffy places, and there's certain things I'd like to verify before committing to this deal. \n\nLike, will there be other 21+ year olds like me? Am I the only one? Since I'm a black female, do I have to interact with the racists? What about grandpa who think it's okay to still grab my ass because it was okay in his neck of the woods 50 years ago??\n\nNot to get like super deep, but my dad was in one of those retirement home/rehab centers for a while, and I used to see how lonely some of these older folks got; especially when they were super sick or their mental health had deteriorated pretty badly.\n\nAnd no, I'm not shaming anyone for not wanting to be around elderly relatives 24/7. It can get pretty rough or sad when \"Nice, sweet & bubbly grandma\" who baked everyone cookies and loved everyone at one point turns into \"raging racist grandma\" who's aggressive and regularly throws slurs at the nonwhite staff or \"Incontinent wheelchair bound grandma who stares at the nothingness, and occasionally speaks to her dead relatives\". If people don't want to deal with it, I get it. \n\nAnyway, having conversations with them were pretty great as I got to hear some pretty cute or cool stories--Unfortunately I couldn't hear much because usually I just came to keep watch over my dad who couldn't speak for himself, and then I had to rush to leave to catch a reasonable bus home. But when I did, it was pretty telling that most just wanted someone to speak to, and share what they had on their mind. \n\nOn the topic for this \"arrangement\", I'm sure some of them would LOVE to hear my woes of struggling in school and getting a job lmao. Like a Grandkid-Adjacent? Seems like a win-win to me.\n\nOh and plus the free shelter and (hopefully) free food?? Shit, I'd know each of them + the regular rotating staff by name by the end of the first week. \n\nHowever, if I'm all alone, going through with this deal, it's a no. As I said, nursing homes can be iffy places. A lot of those people are sad, old, and ready to die because their family wants nothing to do with them. It's depressing and when I left after visiting my dad, I was always in tears. Even if he himself was alright, the whole vibe was depressing. Hearing people with like dementia cry out, or seeing the wide eyed ones grab at the air. I alone wouldn't be able to fix the atmosphere and \"be the change I want to see\", esp with my own depression, you know?\n\nBut if other people around my age were in on this deal too, then it's a yes because there would be a less chance of me getting lonely myself or getting burnout after being forced to socialize so much with people who are probably too old to \"get me\", just to keep a free room over my head.\n\nEdit : I decided to treat this question more seriously than I did before.",

I could always pop down a few floors to where most the students were if I wanted the party vibe too. Was great to have the option to lay low or kick it up. I don't miss the fire alarms.",

I'd rather have my own place and do visits. So no I wouldn't but it's not because I wouldn't want to hang with the elderly, it's because those places are terrible unless it's a super expensive one which most cannot afford. The best part of the job was hanging out with them but it was heart breaking and my job was low level so I couldn't make much of a difference I felt. The was a sweet lady named pearl who just an angel. Her son stole her money and they sent her to that place that was absolutely a garbage place. The staff were horrible there. People got ignored.  I had been a caregiver in another state but didn't have licensing so while waiting for the next class I was a janitor and I wasn't allowed to help people. People who needed help with buttons or someone just to talk not even medical stuff. I got in trouble a few times for helping but staff would strait up ignore calls. When pearl died her shitty son didn't even call on her birthday that was three days prior let alone visit when he lived close. They were gonna throw out her belongings. She had all these cards from her husband and friend both who were dead so I saved them. I had to be the one to clean up her room and throw all her precious stuff out because her garbage son didn't want or even look at any of it. He did have them save her wedding ring tho. He convinced her to sign over her assets to him so he could sell her house to get her care. Her husband was some fancy Hollywood guy who worked with celebs in the 40s and she actually was well off but he put her in the shittiest cheapest place possible and bought himself a house and boat with the money. This place literally had 4 residents to a bathroom. It was mostly for medicaid users and impoverished elderly so the quality is terrible. No one deserves that but she could have bought herself a nice place. It was totally messed up. She would always say if her husband knew what her son did he would roll in his grave. Never brought the grandkids by to visit or nothing. Broke my heart. I legit got in trouble one time for helping a woman who had her shirt stuck on her head because she called for help and no one came so she did it herself and got stuck till I found her. They left people in urine for way too long. Another lady fell and stayed on the floor for hours. Her face was all super bruised and then she slept for three days before dying. There was also an old dude who super sweet but come to find out he was actually a murderer and they arrested him and he went to court n stuff. Pretty sure he killed his wife too. It was in the news and stuff. He was a total flirt and super sweet so that was a shock.",

New people coming in looking so hopeful just to see their soul literally die in a matter of days. See people who think they are young go through transitional care only to beg you to get you the fuck outta there.\n\nFucking terrible. \nFuck no.",

The latter make me sad, because they’re perfectly fine humans, but they’ve been ruined by a world that taught them to fear. \n\nWith the former, I’d love to! I can spend the rest of my time reading and studying what I want, and I get to learn from their experience and also do work that would feel fulfilling by giving them company. It’s abysmal that we throw old people in homes because we’re all too busy working 40+ hours a week to take care of them, and we should be ashamed of our collective selves for it.",

You ask this to a homeless person, obviously they will do it. Ask this to a mormon, you might think they'll obviously do it. That's the problem though. If someone already has a place, maybe even a great place, why would they live there? In fact, I don't quite understand what being 20-30 years old has to do with anything anyways. Is there a reason older people can't volunteer for this? Why can't you give a 50y/o the same opportunity as a 20-30y/o? It just doesn't really make sense. \n\nI think the real question here is would you go to a retirement/nursing home just to get the opportunity to spend time with people who may not get to see others outside often. Even then, I think this question is contradictory because (unless someone is actively trying not to fit in) most people would say yes to the proposal of it. But I'm almost certain no one would actually go out and do it themselves (unless there is a caveat like money, already have someone living in a nursing home, someone reminds you, you're bored, etc.) \n\nBad question, bad sub",

Apparently this is common for people suffering from dementia/Alzheimers.\n\nThe day that she passed was hard, but I was happy that she didn't have to suffer any more.

            "text": "It sounds enticing but I have *extreme* reservations about this from a legal standpoint. I am not a lawyer and my personal viewpoints on labor law and landlord-tenant law are though the lens of only having ever lived and worked in California (USA).\n\nI know that it is permissible under CA law to offer rent free living space as compensation for work, but it's pretty fraught and should be avoided. There must be ironclad contract terms that assign dollar amounts to the value of the employee's labor and the rent, even though no money is exchanged. Those dollar amounts may be subject to minimum wage regulations as well as withholdings for social security, federal state and local taxes, etc *even though no money is exchanged.* The tenant also has rights that may make it hard to fire them, since they have to be evicted at the same time. It's such a complicated needle to thread that I couldn't just give the employer the benefit of the doubt that they are scrupulous and diligent about avoiding practices that are technically labor abuse and/or tenant abuse. On the contrary, as a prospective onsite elder-care volunteer I would be very suspicious that the facility management might actually be using this system to get away with abusive practices on purpose, and I would want to see some kind of proof otherwise before I seriously considered it. Even if my suspicions in that regard were completely satisfied, I would still have questions about what other corners they might be trying to cut.\n\nBeyond that, elder care is **medical care.** I totally understand the benefit of increased socialization for the residents - better quality of life, better neuroplasticity, less likelihood of depression and more. It would be one thing to provide that kind of social engagement with system of trained but unpaid volunteers or interns. A system like that would attract young people who aspire to medical field careers, and would help the volunteers build a strong and unique CV. The training part is important because you have to consider whose face-time with the residents is being \"supplemented\" (i.e: replaced) by these unpaid workers - Nurses. Doctors. People with other types of degrees and qualifications in professional elder care. The kinds of people who have serious investment in their careers and who know better than an average joe how to actively look for symptoms of stroke, heart attack, cognitive dysfunction, signs of elder abuse, and more. People who are familiar with the residents medication schedules and aren't likely to look the other way if a resident tries to, say, sneak in a six pack even though they are diabetic. Or even something even more benign, like a resident asking to have a glass of grapefruit juice from the lunch buffet.  I'm not saying that everyone who even visits a retirement home needs to have gone to a high-falootin medical school. I just mean that even an unpaid volunteer position in a facility like that should be filled by someone who understands the importance and seriousness of their role explicitly, and that recruitment for such a position should be undertaken in a way that attracts very high-quality candidates. Using rent-free onsite accommodations to attract applicants would probably work, but it would muddy the waters with candidates who just don't have better living arrangements for whatever reason. There are lots of reasons why a rent-free apartment would be attractive to lots and lots of people, and weeding through all those people for the best possible candidate would be a nightmare. From the viewpoint of a prospective resident, or the child of a prospective resident, knowing that the facility attracts unpaid staff by letting them live onsite for free would raise questions about the quality of medical care available there. Not deal-breaking questions, but questions.",

Already did basically just that for most of July ‘17- September ‘18.\n\nMy grandmother lived in a retirement home that’s part of a chain of retirement homes, and they had a few spare rooms for residents to stay in who were traveling (i.e. she could leave the home in Dallas and, while traveling to Boulder, stay a night in one of the spare rooms at the home in OKC).\n\nAnyway, I was fresh out of college, very sociable, and needed a place to stay while I figured my logistics out (I was working as an HR temp for three days a week and building sets for a theater in Dallas in the evenings, so I was less a vagrant and more just a young dude with a lot of free time during the days). I’d done some work for the manager of that retirement home when I was in high school, and I was there to eat with my grandmother and her friends in their big dining hall for dinner at least four nights a week, so the owner offered to let me stay in one of their spare rooms if I helped the residents with their furniture-moving needs, ran their bingo games for them on Tuesday and Thursdays, and ran their movie nights.\n\nThe furniture-moving turned into a lot of chatting while I moved couches around, and some of the folks whose spouses had already passed would definitely ask me to help them move furniture just to have someone to talk to. I liked it a lot, the old folks are full of stories and often have nobody to tell them to. One old man worked for GM’s defense division back in the day and helped design the M1 Abrams tank, and he had a little wooden version of the tank on a plaque-stand that had his name and the team’s name, and was basically a thank-you-for-your-work gift from the company. Another woman had been a dancer on Broadway back in the late 50s and early 60s, and she had all these old newspaper clippings. She eventually became a teacher in a town south of Houston, and had some great stories from that time as well.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven’t been there in a little while. I got a place of my own at the end of 2018 and kept visiting, but then they locked down pretty hard back in March of 2020 and then my grandmother caught Covid and passed back in February, so there’s not much to take me back there now that they’re opening up again. I hope they’re all well, but I think that at least a handful of the folks I really liked there have passed in the last year.",

For example, if you get a nice 1BD \"apartment\" in a nice area of SF from that deal, and you are obligated to spend a minimum of 10 hours/week, then it's almost $60/hr at $30k annual rent ($2.5k average monthly) for 520 hours/yr to \"make rent\".\n\nNow $60k/hr is equivalent to >$120k per year annual income, so some 20-30 year old person may find that to be attractive, because they would have to work longer hours for the same living space. This benefit can further provide them flexibility in choosing jobs and making decisions without the burden of ensuring they have enough to cover rent. I know of a few people back when I was in that age group who would change professions if money wasn't an overriding concern.\n\nThere are still other outstanding considerations, however. For example, we'll still need to factor the tax implications of such an arrangement; just because you live rent-free doesn't mean the IRS will consider that as a zero-value gift (even if you do provide services in return). And for some young people, living in a retirement/nursing home may be enough of a mental block that it's unlikely they'll agree to it, regardless of the terms.",

When I was in high school, I used to go polka dancing at the VA and was usually the youngest person there by thirty or forty so years. 10/10 totally fun and probably what encouraged my love of dancing!",

As a nearly 26 year old with chronic pain conditions I can relate to that. It broke my heart to notice some of my older family members would talk to her like she's an old person. As if she was slow or worse still, talk around her. Whenever I was at a family gathering I'd like to sit beside her and make sure she is included in conversation and that she could hear everything being said. I would also purposefully bring attention to her for example with some of my cousin's children. \n\nI love hearing people's experience and stories and elderly people can be the warmest and most hilarious people!",

You'll mature in a much more robust way as you're bound to acquire the most efficient/good habits/traits these people have learned over their lifetimes, invaluable insight and mature perspectives that you typically only acquire with life experience, a level of confidence above most as you're around generally positive people that WANT to speak to you rather than snobby peers searching for social status... And the most bittersweet, a healthy appreciation for life as you'll be forced to learn to cope with death in a healthy way. \n\nThe most important thing though, you're helping people in their most desperate time. Some of these people see family members a couple times a year at best. The world has processed them, taken their most productive years then discarded them. It's scary to get old, it's scary watching your friends, family and icons fade away to be replaced with strange new faces, tech, etc. \n\nYou could probably even make a blog or document the experience (of course with the permission of the residents). \n\nI hope you do this!

Aside from that, there were also a LOT of residents who moved in before alzheimer's set it, but once it was onset their family would not move them to a facility that provided care for such things. They were nearly all prone to random aggressive outbursts, as they were confused and frustrated, but without any inhibitions to prevent them from seriously injuring themselves or others around them. \n\nWhen I started I quickly became friendly with this fun but sarcastic lady, who would basically just stand at the front desk and talk shit. She would often comment on the lady who was suffering from a severe case of alzheimer's, saying how sad it was and helping to keep her occupied. By the time I left the facility sarcastic!lady was still physically there but her mind was completely gone and her children had abandoned all responsibility for her. She and the lady with severe alzheimer's were day to day either the best of friends, or attempting to physically attack each other for knowing too much. This happened to 2 other residents in the short time that I was there. Their mental state rapidly deteriorated without warning, but the other two had children who responded by spending more time with them then before. It didn't make much of a difference but the other two residents didn't get into as many fights where I could see. \n \nAlzheimer's is a serious concern as it's only growing more common and it destroys a person. Obviously, they are still human, deserve respect and care, but they don't act like who they were- they don't know who they were. It's not a rude assumption to say senile people are violent, it's a medically proven fact. They can and often do prove a danger to themselves and others due to confusion, frustration, depression, and in general, loosing themselves. It's not their fault, they can't help it, they don't know any better anymore. \nAlzheimer's inspired Zombies for a reason. One day they are your loved one and the next they are seemingly mindless, it's the stuff of nightmares.  \n\nI wouldn't take this offer, because it's not if you get alzheimer's, it's when. Either you die of cancer or you get alzheimer's. \n\nLive while you're young: our generation does not have a bright future.\n\nAlso: if you have a loved on living in ANY kind of care facility in the US you need to listen to their concerns, document all bruises, and visit them as often as possible. Even during my training they underplayed how important respect, care, and treatment of the elderly was while boasting their treatment team as loving. I left after voicing and placing several concerns for mistreatment and abuse that were silenced as being standard care. This isn't a single location problem it is VERY widespread. Every kind of resident was mistreated in some way that they rarely complained about, after they are ignored the first time, they don't report again. There is gaslighting as a common practice, and if they are complaining about something that seems weird, random, and bizarre it might just be an easier outlet for their frustrations than what ever is really going on that they don't want to admit is happening to them. \n\nThere is a LOT of sexual assult and activity in general in these facilities, you cannot just stick your parent in a home and leave them.\n\nEveryone is complicit in this, and I was working in a VERY well known, well regarded, and highly rated facility. I would never put my loved one in a US \"care\" home after working at one. It was a traumatizing experience and no one took the residents concerns seriously, especially their children who were told by staff their parents were just \"loosing their minds\".",

I personally don’t want something to fall into my lap because that will never be as good as the opportunities I make for myself. Sure, it could satisfy me, and financially make me secure. It doesn’t mean I would appreciate the job the same way as if I built it from the ground up, or started the position because of a goal I made for myself and actually accomplished it.\n\nI feel like deep down this is why you see the ones who have everything and still hate themselves. They never had to struggle to get where they were. They can’t appreciate life because they never got to love or get a chance to fail. When so many people do nothing but fail in life, and you see someone you perceive someone as never failing but still end up killing themselves... it’s because they were never given a chance to be who they wanted to be. They never got to figure out what they wanted or why made them happy. They were thrown into a position most look at as “successful and exciting” like a football player... but it doesn’t mean that person doesn’t want to plant flowers the rest of their life or wants to drawl. It just means they were good at what they were told to do. Yea, they are successful and sometimes look happy when you saw the at interview of h em buying that thing they wanted on tv... they also wake up every morning just like that guy who hates his min wage job... and doesn’t want to start the day and wishing he could do anything else. All while being told by the ones around him that “[they] should be grateful they even have this opportunity because others would kill for this moment”.\n\nI’m already clinically depressed. I don’t need more reasons to dislike myself. And handouts are nothing but a pathetic reason to pretend you’ve ever done anything in your life worth while. Whether it seems like you’re doing something or not.. the truth is you didn’t do shit. You just fit while others are doin shit around you and you take credit for it. It’s not to say the person is worthless, but what they are, is nothing of value and they just fit comfortably in a place where others make the choices that matter. You just exist and collect. It’s just a sad way to live imo.\n\n\nFor the record I’m assuming this is the rest of your life. Not that you could move or move on. I’m taking the question as a “would you choose this for the rest of your life because it’s a freebie and could you adjust your life around this”. Obviously in a time of need and if it was only to get on my feet... yea I’d take this opportunity in a second and make the most of it.

Wheezing unable to breath coughing, but yet refused to get tested or go Dr because he didnt wanna get the \"FAKE\" virus.  He's unemployed and soaking up loads of church money \"to pay his rent\" which his landlord has been irate over him not paying and using the last year no eviction policy to just sit around and drink whiskey on his lanai. \n\nBig pass for me.",

I love history and loved listening to the residents talk about what life was like through key events like World War I, World War II, the depression, the 50s, the 60s etc. I loved hearing about what their daily lives were like. I loved hearing their wisdom. I met this amazing resident who was the first in her immigrant family to go past middle school and was the first woman at her college to get a degree. She travelled the world doing research and had the most amazing stories and wisdom. We used to play board games and she taught me great tips for increasing word scores in scrabble. She was a very revered professor and she used to have her old students come visit.

Sounds like a good idea at first glance, but the more I think about it, the worse it becomes.\n\nThe title implies you are spending time in exchange for rent-free living. However that just sounds like a regular job and while it could be nice at first, I think after several hours/day for multiple weeks, it starts to become exactly that: an obligation you do in exchange for a compensation (rent-free living).\n\nIf I have to work to pay rent, I'd rather try to find a job that aligns with my career. I'm not sure if you could even put this kind of deal in your CV but I know that it'd probably be useless compared to actually doing an entry-level job for the career I'm studying for. \n\nSo some people in the comments suggest they would be doing it because spending time with the eldery is nice and fun. However - You don't need this type of deal to do that. You can already do that \\*without\\* having to live there and without having to sign a contract obligating you to do this type of deal.\n\nI do believe however that it could be beneficial without the obligation, and with a more evened-out ratio. Maybe you could mix a student home with an assited-living home? People wouldn't be forced to do anything, but living near each other could \\*naturally\\* lead to contact, e.g when both order food and eat in the same canteen.

Meet one and they will probably hook you up.  Resorts have employees that don’t see 8% of what it costs for their time and knowledge.  The resorts rob their employees and there is zero respect.  Half the cost is huge for us and we risk getting fired because, why not?  They are terrible to us.\n\nWe care.  We just get torn down by greedy fucks who will replace us with a newbie and charge the same price.  It’s unbelievably disgusting and dangerous to costumers/clients.  If you side bar on their day off, everyone involved wins.  Fuck the buisness.",

I guess the answer would be...No. Not because I don't think it's a good cause, I think it's actually genuinely great... But, \n\nI was a caregiver for my mom who got a rare form of a rare illness, I think called primary progressive aphasia. Spent years watching her mentally decline while having to do things to take care of her that I wish upon no one. It was very difficult to say the least. \n\nDuring this the worst thing happened; my grandmother, someone who lived with me my entire life, that was basically my best friend since forever, who at the age of 90 was happily going on helicopter rides, walking on glaciers, went bowling every week- \n\nSomeone that was  was completely independent...Got cancer- I was caregiving for her while she went from independent, to needing lots of aid....then bedridden and passing in the span of ...IDK maybe a month. I was caregiving for 2 so so much was going on between caring for her and my mom at the same time. \n\nSleep at this point was a luxury. It was soul crushing to see my grandmother, best friend ever, someone I loved dearly die infront of my eyes while I was watching my mom die a slower death. If I didn't have my brother & my father along for all of this I don't know what I would have done.\n\nIt still hurts to talk about her for me. I'm questioning why I'm typing all this up when, who's gonna read this? Or care? Think I'm just falling down the stairs of self reflection. \n\nBefore all of this when I was a child my mom & I would visit my grandfather who had alzhiemers. I saw many elderly patents who were suffering from various forms of mental illness. Many years of visiting, then years of caregiving has taken it's toll on us.\n\nNow, I'm with my dad trying to care for him. He's depressed after all we've gone through, is doing better but is still trying to take back his life.\n\nIt's just too much to take for me at this stage. It's something I've gone out of my way to avoid talking with friends & family about. \n\nI apologize for the tangent, I know there are people who are doing as you asked in nursing homes, happily & it's something that's genuinely great! Seriously with all the above I've said, picture having a family of 6 siblings that either never visited or did so maybe once every few months, did nothing. \n\nThey deserve better. \n\n But, I've just seen so much, that I don't know if I could handle it after everything my family has been through.",

Best roommate I have ever had, even though she fought me off getting to bed until I told her how my day went “because the news is shit and frankly she was bored and had saved up her spunk to get her way.” My God I miss that woman so much. \n\nMy other grandmother passed away from old age but in a high level of dementia and her later life living with my parents was hell. I never was a kindred spirit with her anyhow. “Respect your elders” <- (even if they are rude, racist, mean to YOU and everyone else). \n\nSo to answer the question: Older folks can be absolutely amazing or the complete opposite. No, they can’t help it if they wet the bed or lose their whits. We are ALL once an adult, twice a child..  unless our maker calls us sooner. \n\nI distinctly remember the first thing that make me break down with COVID was I learned that the nursing home patients could no longer be with their family members. I thought of my Maw Maw.... and I just wept for everyone who didn’t get the same experience as I did, as she did. \n\nFor anyone reading this, if you happen to fall into that category... genuinely... physically... my heart aches for you.

The building was grand and historic in an amazing part of town, with large grounds and immaculate gardens. The newer buildings were so beautifully designed they could’ve been featured on HGTV. The staff did their best to keep everyone happy and healthy, with a remarkable programming lineup...\n\nNone of that changed the fact that nursing homes are inherently heartbreaking places. At my desk I literally listened to people die. I watched people struggle with their failing health, mourn their loved ones, be separated from spouses who needed more care than they could provide. I was repeatedly sexually harassed by a WWII Vet with dementia and still only felt bad for a man who was fighting and failing to just remember when lunch was (11am, every day).\n\nI think I’m a better person for working there. It greatly increased my empathy for others. I feel lucky to have met and spent time with the residents I met...\n\nBut I still regularly check obituaries for my favorite residents. It was hard working there and I still feel the weight of all of the suffering and death I experienced second-hand there. \n\nIf you don’t have a passion for elderly care, and training in dealing with everything that goes along with it (grief counseling, memory care, even properly pushing wheel chairs so you don’t injure the people you’re helping), I would not recommend it.\n\nAs remarkable and beautiful—and full of care and community—as the place I worked for was, many of the residents there would have lived at home if they still could. \n\nSo no, I wouldn’t live in a nursing/retirement home for free.",

And then...coronavirus hit. All the boarders got closed and the job I was going to have in the other state was canceled because of COVID19 precautions. I didn't know what to do so I spoke to my supervisor about the situation. The company I was working for didn't get any good candidates for the job so my supervisor gave me the opportunity to extend my stay if I wanted. Of course I wanted to say yes, but where I was living in couldn't extend my 'stay' because they already had plans with the room I was renting. At this point I thought about just moving in with my mother in a different state than the one I was living in. I let me supervisor know about my living situation and not being able to extend my stay and that's when she thought of the idea of me living at the retirement home. The residents were going to go through a hard time because families wouldn't be able to visit, they had to quarantined  from each other, and the person they engaged with 5x a week for 8 hrs a day was about to be gone (me). I took the opportunity. I lived rent free in a luxury studio, free gourmet meals, free cable, in a beautiful location with an ocean view. I will say it was the best experience I had because I explored the whole community from going down to the basement to sitting on the roof at night on a 5 story building just looking at the stars with the love of my life. Yes, my partner worked in the same building so she was able to visit as much as she wanted to after work and didn't have to worry about being late to work the next day lol. Living there also gave me a more inside look on how the residents lived and I was honestly able to connect with them more. I continued working my 8 hrs 5x a week as a Life Engagement Coordinator.

I also, have unfortunately been afflicted with a few chronic illnesses so it's not like I can't relate to that 😂 \n\nHaving nurses nearby also wouldn't be a bad idea... I literally slipped in the shower two days ago and my whole left side is very bruised right now. I joked to my friends I skipped middle age straight to being an elderly person 😂 They joked back that I may need lifealert. I genuinely freaked for a few minutes because I couldn't get up and I am living alone, with nobody else in this city who would even think to check on me.\n\nAnd not having to pay rent would ease my worries a lot of course; nearly 2/3rds of my monthly expenses go to rent. As a kid I also usually preferred to chat with adults anyway.\n\nAs long as I get to keep my cat with me (and tbh I think she'd like old people, what I can gather from her life before I adopted her leads me to believe she was an elderly person's pet), I wouldn't really mind at all. Sounds pretty nice.\n\n...This is, of course, only if it's a proper retirement home that like. Is actually well maintained and staffed and everything.

People paid good money for the spot. Let me just quickly list things that were happening there.\n\nKeep in mind it was a nursing home: that means people with alzheimers, people with cancers on their deatbed, people with dementia, after troke, paralyzed, etc. The rooms looked more like hospital rooms, with 2 or 3 beds, than that what you see in tv shows, where it looks like grandma's house. Maybe retirement homes are different, I don't know. \n\nHere's the list:\n\n* People calling their mom in the middle of the night waking everyone up\n* People tied to wheelchairs because they would fall when tried to walk\n* People calling nurses witches, whores, motherfuckers, everything\n* People tied to beds at night because they would rome and harass other patients\n* People taking other people's things\n* People eating their own shit\n* People smearing their shit all over their room and neighbours\n* People trying to masturbate in the hallway\n* People dressing up and trying to go home\n* People asking you to take them home to their kids 10 times / day\n* People kicking, screaming, punching, pulling, shouting (until they were on right meds)\n* People healthy in the head who had to witness all that in horror\n* Constant smell of sickness, piss, shit, vomit, death and besores\n\nI'll just like to add that there are some good things too, not every patient is like that, some are always smiling, happy, gentle, some are good conversationalists, some confuse you with their kids and hug you, feed you candy their faimilies left for them etc. Those moments are great and memorable, but I still wouldn't want to work there.",

Before we parted ways, we exchanged numbers. She didn't really have anyone else in her life, and I legitimately was excited to have her as a friend. Plus, she lived in the huge retirement village apartment building across the street, and would be easy to catch up with, once in a while. She even said she'd leave my name with the apartment concierge so I could stop by unannounced, if the mood struck and I didn't have her number handy.  \n...When I hadn't heard from her that week, I was a bit surprised; and after ten days passed, I tried to call her a couple of times, left messages, all that, -and didn't hear back. I went in to her building, considering what she'd said about stopping by anytime, even if it was unannounced. The concierge said she'd died, peacefully in her sleep, on a date that I worked out was just the day after we'd met. I still don't know how to feel about that. But I feel we both missed out in ways.

My grandma, who passed in 2014, was there with him/us every night, knocking on the walls, talking to him and us, along with his mother and her friends and family.. they would have literal ghosty dance parties in the living room above us each night. I'd go up there expecting to find him wandering around out of bed only to find dark emptiness in a now quiet room. Back down the stairs I'd go and hear them start back up again. When he eventually became unable to walk, and I was still hearing the dancing.. I knew.\n\n But the craziest was the night he passed. He passed shortly before 5am, but between midnight and his passing we heard some truly bizarre stuff. Banging on his wall next to him. Hard banging. Hard enough to knock the photographs of his four daughters off the wall, landing beside his bed. Again, this was a man literally on his deathbed, 5 feet from the wall, when we heard all this. And my wife heard it all, my aunt who was there that night heard the knocking.. and we all ran upstairs, fully expecting to have found him laying on the floor but he hadn't moved a muscle. Said someone was trying to talk to him and pulling on his leg. So we weren't surprised when he passed, and felt a sense of calm and relief that he was no longer in pain. And the next night, halloween, was the quietest night we spent there. Not a peep from the afterlife. Nov.1 it started right back up again, but I like to think there was one more dancer up there ❤ (during this time spent there, my cousins fiance whom I'd become close with, took her own life along with their unborn son. And between then. End of Sept, and March 1, beginning of covid, I lost 11 people I knew. None to covid ironically.)",

I loved listening to all their stories and letting them show me all the stuff they were proud of like their art, music, poetry and that. Age and memory problems didn't stop these people from still living their life to the fullest. I would spend extra time with everyone if there wasn't much else for me to do and loved being there for them cause they were just such lovely people who made me feel appreciated for helping. Memory problems scare a lot of people but you learn to look past that and help them to remember who they are by encouraging them to keep up their hobbies and tell us who are in their family pictures and stuff. It really cheers people up if you just spend a little extra time talking to them about the things they're proud of and hanging out rather than just doing the general duties and leaving them.",

Long term care facilites were desperate for nurses so I took a 4 month long contract position in a care home. I negotiated accomodation at the facility and meals into my contract. It was a pretty weird feeling being 21, a brand new nurse, and living amongst the residents. At first, I was extremely lonely because most social places were closed and I didn't know anyone in the area. Before long, I found myself talking to residents in the hallways (sometimes for hours) or heading straight to the courtyard to walk and talk with my neighbours at the end of my shifts. They loved to share their stories and advice, and it meant the world to them that somebody would just stop and listen. I was sad when my contract ended and I now work in a hospital. I will forever have a soft spot in my heart for the elderly. I will fight anyone who argues that \"it's only the old people dying from covid and they are dying anyways\". They are people who were not long ago lively and young like us. They treasure every second of every day and a little bit of love and attention means the world to them.",

The older they get, a lot of people stop chewing with their mouth closed (I have misophonia, I can't continue eating when I hear that, I get too sick). Your body just starts to sort of fall apart, you got all these ailments and afflictions and problems. I can't say what exactly makes me afraid, but I am. I have a hard time being around elderly people. Yes, that includes my own grandparents. That has little to do with their person, and mostly with the way they breathe, their smell, the way they chew, when they cough all wet and disgusting. I know you can't avoid that stuff as you get older, itll happen to everyone.\n\nI had a hard time with my late great-grandmother who passed away just when covid took off, bless her soul. She passed of old age, not covid. She was alive during the Third Reich (we are German). She had a lot of stories to tell. But the last few years, she was almost blind, extremely hard of hearing and increasingly affected by dementia. I wouldn't have wanted to be in her shoes. For the longest time, she remembered us all, she was just missing the last ~ 5 years. But whenever we sat at the table, she couldnt follow the conversation, she couldn't hear well enough. I don't know exactly why but she was too far along to have hearing aids fitted. She was essentially excluded. My designated place at the table was often next to her. I couldn't really eat because, well... Old people eating noises.\n\nOne time in elementary school we had reading day. You pick a book, you put your name on a list for a kindergarden, home, some Form of care organization and you go there and read for the people. That way you practice your reading and the people you read for have something to listen to and someone to talk to.\nI came too late for the kindergarden lists, my only option was a nursing home. Oh God how I dreaded it. We were a small group of kids, some of us were just dropped off in the common area of the home. My introverted ass was supposed to sit and read out loud. I started, but I got stared at by the entire room. I get that they would look at me, but that was all sorts of confused, mad, aggressive looks. I got yelled at by an aggressive and confused elderly lady. I was too afraid to continue reading. I talked to a nurse, got the teacher and booked it.\nIt happened again when there were very few spaces for kindergardens and I got dealt a disabled home. Again, this is nothing against the people living there. I'm sure they're usually perfectly fine, or it's not their fault. But the room was dingy and smelly, I felt like I walked into a room that had been sealed since 1980 and just now opened. The staff watched the disabled folks better and I didn't get touched or yelled at.\n\nIts none of their fault. But I'd rather live alone in an absolute shit apartment than he in touch with the elderly daily.",

I remember we had a picnic where we bussed a group of able people to a local park for a picnic, another time we arranged transportation to a high school play. This was such satisfying volunteer work,I will (still) remember the smiles, hugs, and general happiness of the residents.\nOne instance in particular stands out,there was a very old woman at the Home for Aged Hebrews, who I was told spoke no English, not to waste my time. I started visiting her every time I would go and we started playing backgammon when after awhile she started thanking me in english, no one had ever spent anytime with her and she had no visitors, she later explained that she felt no need to speak English when no one from her family would visit , she was stuck in her room with just the nurses coming in once or twice a day. she just needed to have someone spend time with her. The nurses were astonished that she knew English. A little time with some compassion  made a great difference in her ending life.",

My grandpa loved to watch the kids play outside on his balcony and waved back. I miss him. \n\nI would do this definately. It might be difficult at first if you are not used to working with older people. But eventually you get the hang of it, and it could reward you greatly. An insight in history for example, eapecially the war. I finally understand why we always get a cookie when we order coffee or tea. The cookie was considered a huge treat and happened only once a week. One cookie. When everything improved, the cookie happened more often and kind of turned into a tradition of wealth and restaurants did the same (partially because people started asking for it). Same with clothing, how we used to have two sets of clothing and flour companies started to put print on their products because people used it to sew clothing to wear. I knew some of it, but it’s interesting to hear it first-hand from those who experienced it.",

Especially thank you to the kind people who awarded this post.\n\nDue to the sheer volume of comments and chat messages, I can't address everything. But there are a few points I'd like to make. \n\nFirst, I am actually a graduate student who studies intergenerational relationships. In particular, looking at the context of cohousing programs (like the one I've suggested above). This question IS NOT part of my formal research but I was curious to find out what a few Redditors might think of the idea. I definitely got more than I bargained for.\n\nSecond, if you are currently interested in learning about what cohousing options are available in your area, you can Google topics such as Home Sharing, University-Based Retirement Communities, and Live-In Students at retirement centers. You might be surprised what you find.\n\nThird, I understand that there are fundamental differences between retirement homes and nursing (or long-term care) homes. However, these differences are usually very nuanced between different countries and regions so the question hopefully remains relevant for a huge swathe of the internet. I apologize if it confused anyone or led to misinformation in the comments.\n\nFinally, the sheer amount of attention this question got seemed to strike a chord with people. Some are firmly against the idea, either for themselves or all young people, while others are ready to sign up today. It has also drawn a lot of attention to some of the awful living conditions that some older adults are subject to in poorly managed homes. I hope that the conversations started here will move into life outside Reddit and maybe we can look forward to new ideas about generational housing models for the future. Just a thought.\n\nDon't forget to call your grandparents, grandchildren, and everybody in between. Take care!",

Even other units have residents with behaviors. If it’s not that you can hear the residents from the dementia unit screaming while you’re in another unit. \n\nWe are one of the best nursing homes in our area and residents are taken care of, but nursing homes are sad and they really go there to die. Some of the illnesses that I have seen nurses try to treat us ridiculous because they know the resident is on their deathbed but they have to do everything in their power to help them. Residents are there because they cannot take care of themselves and they’ll be there until they die or until their family decides to bring them home with hospice. They do need the human interaction, but if you lived there you would become another resident and it would be no different than them interacting with the other residents. They are encouraged to participate in activities and eat in the dining room with the other residents, so they do get to spend time with people. The employees (CNAs, nurses, dietary, administration, etc.) all go out of their way to talk to the residents as well. Family can once again come visit (if they’re COVID free). Residents that aren’t from the dementia unit are not restricted to their unit either, they can roam the entire facility. All residents can leave with family whenever they like.\n\nEveryone is mentioning the stories they would hear but I promise that after a week they would all be repeats. One of the reasons I actually prefer the dementia unit is because the other units tend to have grouchier residents (comes with age, I don’t blame them) and residents who think they’re entitled to your every waking moment. Which reminds me, some of the residents don’t sleep! It would be like living in a college dorm again. \n\nI already spent 40 hours a week there; I love my job and I love my residents but hell no. I can’t speak for retirement facilities, but as for nursing homes I don’t know of anyone that would make it longer than a week.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention the sheer amount of illness in nursing homes. Obviously elderly have weakened immune systems, but since working in a nursing home I’ve seen contagious illnesses I’ve never even heard of or haven’t heard about in a long time. I haven’t heard of anyone getting scabies since my dad got it when he was 5 and I started working in a nursing home and 5 of my residents have it. Things like C. Diff and MRSA are concerns, as well as pneumonia and the flu.",

Honestly I don't think I even want to live to that age.\n\nFirst of all, good luck maintaining any kind of clean separation between your life and theirs. If you're living there, you are at the very least mentally burdened full time. I've found that as people get older and less able to do things for themselves, they become worse than children. The little stuff they will endlessly nag you about, but it's the big stuff that is the worst. They tend to become more religious and pray nonstop and for every little thing because unfortunately they've realized there's nothing else they can do. It's a like a death cult and they will endlessly try to drag you into it with them. I want nothing to do with it. They're like drowning people desperately trying to cling onto anything they can. They will drag you into the grave with them if they could. \n\nAnd before anyone calls me heartless, just ask yourself why we put our parents and grandparents in nursing homes and retirement homes in the first place. It's not because we love them so much and want them around. It's kind of like babies -  they are awful to be around. Sure they're cute and fun to play with if you're just a visitor but if they're yours, you also have to deal with the diapers, vomit, crying, and ruining your sleep. We just want to be able to enjoy the fun times and then quickly stick them back in their box so we can pretend the bad parts don't exist. At least babies grow out of it though. The elderly only get worse until they die. And if you're living with them, you don't get a choice between which parts you experience. You get it all.",

The place I'm at is really really fancy and is almost like a resort (it used to be called The Healthcare Resort of *my city's name) with a salon and a pub where they let the residents have a drink a couple of times a week and I am really hoping to be able to mingle with the other residents more the longer I'm here.  I would love to chat with them and get to know them,  the elderly have so many stories and life lessons for us to learn from them,  I plan on having my nurse take me down to the pub so I can have some casual chit chat and get to know my neighbors and hopefully future friends. I used to volunteer with a lot of elderly veteran programs before my veteran dad died of cancer and I would really love the opportunity to get to know some of our local elders because it's just as important for them to have community and conversation, it's hard for all of us to be here since COVID has restricted any visitors (I got a special approval for my 6 year old daughter to have a 2 hour visit with me in my room which I'm so excited for because they told me at first that she could only come see me outside my window, there is a small covid Hotspot here and a lot of the elderly residents have a very hard time not seeing their families.) \n\nI'm doing what I can to make the best of my time here, being a younger person living in a nursing home with all of my health problems,  and I hope to get to know my fellow residents and hopefully bring them some joy and friendship  while they're here :)",
