Water shortages will be a major issue in the future of this planet.\n\nPlease reconsider your showering habits.\n\nEDIT: For those of you who are assuming I think that water that goes down a shower drain somehow magically evaporates from the earth, that's not what I mean. I mean that gray water requires treatment to be usable again for a similar purpose, and it requires a lot of energy. Someone pointed out that people's showers leave a relatively small footprint on fresh water usage, but the point of my post was that if everyone was taking hour-long showers, it wouldn't be a small footprint. Just seems wasteful and indulgent if you're in a city without some kind of aquifer/septic system that handles these things.\n\nEdit: TIL There are a hell of a lot of very angry hour-long shower takers on reddit.",

My razor is one of the glass bulldog ones because I kept injuring myself with my safety razor (stupid name for such a dangerous shave, but I understand that it’s predecessor was a fucking knife, so it’s “safe” by default..) but the bulldog one fucking sucks, so it takes forever to shave, (plus... I’m European, so.. it’s like shaving 2 people.) once I’m done the shaving, I do all the washing of my body, and then I rinse out the Conditioner, then I comb a hair oil through my hair to keep it soft & then I get out. In between all of that, I angrily stim at the sound of the water, I try desperately to remove the hairs that fall out of my head from my body because they’re a sensory nightmare, I scream a little bit, and I take some breaks to just sit and catch my breath cause I get dizzy in there.

But I do like long showers, 20, 30 mins, maybe 40 sometimes, can't be sure, don't time it, but I just, use the time to think.  I'll angle the water so it doesn't hit my face, just sit back in the tub, and just think about stuff.  It's a kind of meditation, where I let my mind wander, I could end up pondering how to handle a tough situation in life, or as simple as thinking threw plot points to a book or show I'm into at the moment.   Your alone, the warm rain feels good, the sound of falling water is always relaxing to me, and I just let my mind drift where it may.  Then the water gets cold and I get out.  (you clean yourself at the start then relax, it's a rookie mistake to relax first then finish your shower in cold water. LOL.)",

Most of my showers I throw my hair in a bun, wash my body and face and am out in under 10 minutes.",

It could also stem from when I was a kid we were really poor so my mother wouldn't give us  sink baths or reuse bath water to save money on the water bill so she had enough money for gas and groceries for the month. \n\n3) most of my time in the shower is spent cleaning myself  7 minutes of my time in the shower is spent brushing my teeth another 10 or so minutes is spent letting shampoo/conditioner do its job. I also have a skin condition called keratosis pilaris I will develop these small pimple like bumps on my arms and legs that are just my hair follicles being plugged up with excess keratin so I exfoliate my entire body to reduce the break outs. \n\nSo ya an hour might seem like a long time for a shower for most people but it's normal for me because I have to  be very thorough",

            "text": "I (18F) have four different types of showers I take. The first one is casual shower, where I just wash my body and NOT my hair. That shower takes maybe 5 minutes, sometimes a little longer if it's in the mornings and I'm tired. The second one, is about a 10 minute shower and I wash my body and hair. The third one, is the most thorough. In the third one, I wash my hair, body (x2), shave my legs and other places, as well as do part of my skincare routine in the hot shower. I finish the rest of my skincare routine wrapped in a towel at the sink. That shower can take 30 minutes or more sometimes. But the last shower, is generally the longest. I take showers when I get sad, irritated or angry and come out a brand new person. Depending on how much I want/need to think about and reflect on, it can be an hour sometimes. The hot water just helps me cope, brings me back down to earth. Sometimes I take that opportunity to just... sit there. Sometimes cry because i'm stressed, most of the time just to think.",

The scalding hot water feels good on my body and soothes away the aches and pains from the day before and helps ease me out of my morning grogginess, which I desperately need as getting up has always been a torturous ordeal for me since I’m a very light sleeper and struggle to fall and stay asleep. It regularly takes me an hour or two to fall asleep, which was fine as a kid when I could run on 6 hours of sleep mostly fine and wake up at the first alarm. Now it takes forever to get up. Since I’m working from home now, half the time I sleep in instead until work starts and then use my lunch to shower. Life is stressful though, and when I have the time and really need it, I’ll still take that hour when I can. I suffer from migraines, and like I said, I need that peace and quiet where it’s just me and my thoughts without intrusion.

It's not that I deliberately take long or do stuff like staring at the walls, I just... take so long.\n\nFirst I'll wash my hair. That does not add much to the time requirement, because I have female alopecia and thus am almost bald. Also saves me the requirement of all the other stuff most women seem to do, like conditioner and deep conditioner and rinses and whatnot - it's not really a market I am familiar with. I just use a small amount of baby shampoo, massage it in, let it sit for a short time, rinse it off and then I am done with the hair. Then I use a sponge with special cleaning product for the sensitive areas, followed by an exfoliant thingy with shower gel to go thoroughly over my body. I'll spend some extra time on the upper arms, elbows, and legs because they need the most exfoliating. Rinse. Shave. Rinse. Then I'll dry the shower which takes a bit of time, but saves lots of cleaning time because I have to do it way less. So squeegee on all surfaces, then use a dishtowel to dry what is left. \n\nOut of the shower, drying myself off and then I need to moisturise my whole body. Once that is done, hop into clothes, apply deodorant, brush my five hairs left and pin them up under a beanie, and then I am done.

These are formulas that contain D-panthenol, a vitamin-B-complex factor; polysorbate 80, a cleansing agent for the scalp; and natural herbs.”\n\n“Over the weekend I plan to go to Bloomingdale’s or Bergdorf’s and on Evelyn’s advice pick up a Foltene European Supplement and Shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine. Also the Vivagen Hair Enrichment Treatment, a new Redken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair. Luis Carruthers recommended the Aramis Nutriplexx system, a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation.”\n\n“Once out of the shower and toweled dry I put the Ralph Lauren boxers back on and before applying the Mousse A Raiser, a shaving cream by Pour Hommes, I press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair.”\n\n“Then I always slather on a moisturizer (to my taste, Clinique) and let it soak in for a minute. You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it – preferably with a brush, which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers – which I’ve found makes removing the hair easier.Leave the sideburns and chin for last, since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften. Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting.”\n\n“Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather. You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol. Never use cologne on your face, since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older. One should use an alcohol-free antibacterial toner with a water-moistened cotton ball to normalize the skin.”\n\n“Applying a moisturizer is the final step. Splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture.”\n\n“Next apply Gel Appaisant, also made by Pour Hommes, which is an excellent, soothing skin lotion. If the face seems dry and flaky – which makes it look dull and older – use a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin (it can also make your tan look darker).”\n\n“Then apply an anti-aging eye balm (Baume Des Yeux) followed by a final moisturizing “protective” lotion.”\n\n“A scalp-programming lotion is used after I towel my hair dry. I also lightly blow-dry the hair to give it body and control (but without stickiness) and then add more of the lotion, shaping it with a Kent natural- bristle brush, and finally slick it back with a wide-tooth comb.”",

Then I wash it again, because there no way doing it once cleaned it well enough, and there are still greasy/tacky spots. I work the shampoo into every strand, work to make sure it reaches through to my scalp, and behind the ears, and do my best to de-tangle the knots that developed simply from it getting wet. then I rinse my hair again. Then I spend some more time de-clogging the drain. Then I condition my hair. Using about a half gallon of conditioner to make sure it is evenly spread throughout the entirety of it and working it in so that there are no unconditioned spots. Then I let it sit. While I'm letting the condition sit, I wash the rest of me. Scrubbing down every corner of my body, I wont go into all the details, but as an example, I make sure to get between my toes, under my toenails, and the edges where nail meets the skin, as dead skin and sock lint tends to collect there if I don't do a thorough cleaning. Then I rinse off the soap and the conditioner, working the conditioner out so that none is left behind to form greasy spots when it dries, while also doing some more de-tangling. Turn off the water, and try to strain out the water from my hair the best I can. And of course, try to de-clog the drain again. Then I step out of the shower and dry off. One towel is not enough as it gets fully saturated just by wiping myself down, so hang that one up, grab the second one and try to dry off the rest of me that I can before moving on to my hair, which once I use there it becomes completely saturated and useless. Brush my teeth. Shave if I have to. Step out of the bathroom, and it's an hour and 20 min later.\n\nI hate fucking showering.",

Do face afterwards because showering likely brought to head a couple little whiteheads also, and trying to wash my face in the shower just pisses it off and gets me splotchy and rashy. \n\nI do shut off the water when I sit there and scrub so less wasting water and so water isn't just washing off soap or a scrub I'm trying to use. \n\nEither that or I take really really long baths to relax, scrub off and do a kind of reset on things, do a hair cleanse and mask, etc and everything else without a rush. It's easier to care for my weird skin that way too. \n\nI take shorter showers or clean at the sink for regular maintenance, but the once a week or every two weeks helps with feeling really clean and just pull everything off that the shorter stuff just doesn't cut it for. \n\nShort ones just feels more like for basic surface like sweat, pollen, dirt, or whatever else.",

After you're good and scrubbed, rinse off your entire body. You repeat the same process with conditioner and body wash getting your entire body so you smell good. you rinse off and do the smaller little things like scrub the sole of your foot with one of those hard rock brushes.   \neach takes around 5 minutes each, taking about 35 minutes overall, but this isn't including time spent staring off into space which may change the time.   \nFrom there, you need to dry off, so what you do is grab your towel while still in the bath as to not splash water everywhere, and dry off while standing in the tub/shower. At this point it has been 45-50 minutes, and then the last 10 minutes is used to brush teeth, put on deodorant, shave, and possibly dry your hair if you don't have time to air dry.  \n\n\nThere is a lot that you should be doing while showering, so I am pretty grossed out by anyone who gets in and out in under 5 minutes.",

Phone stays on the charger in my room.\n\nI trip over my words a lot, unable to spit out what I mean so I often practice speaking for a bit. Tongue twisters, try to put something complicated into words.\n\nIf I've been listening to some good stuff on Youtube, I like to try some of the thought experiments like brain in a jar or simulation,  etc.\n\nI also think about how history has pivoted on seemingly small or inconsequential decisions. The one lately on my mind was after hearing that someone saved Churchill's life when he had stepped off a curb to cross a street and was nearly hit by a speeding vehicle. If someone's reflexes had been slower, how would the world be different today? Also just a lot of geographical politics, if one nation did this how would others around it respond, etc. Or apply things that happened in the past to the present and think about reactions.\n\nIt can also be a punishment for myself. For not doing something better or correctly the first time, made a mistake, etc. I'll turn the hot water all the way up until it really hurts and just take it as long as I can thinking about the things I fucked up and how to not do it again. Everyone has to be their own harshest critic.\n\nEvery once in a while I'll get an irresistible urge to just scratch every square inch of my body, especially areas that don't get a lot of touch like shins, forearms, back, etc. All those areas generally feel are clothing or shower gel. And it'll take forever to scratch everything with just nails that I habitually keep short from my old job.\n\nAnd sometimes I just stand in the warm water after I'm clean.

The big joke is that I shower a little less often than they do, but when I do get in the shower, I don't just get in, I MOVE in, lol!\n\nIf you want an actual explanation, here's the best I can do:\n\n\\- Zone out. It's honestly so peaceful in there, it's not just me, right?? I can, like.. sleep with my eyes open. \n\n\\- Sort my thoughts, think about everything I have to do (and convince myself I'm not procrastinating them just because I'm still stressed out about them)\n\n\\- Do shower stuff. I'm a girl with thick hair, so I have to spend extra time shampooing and conditioning my hair, especially if I don't want to have split ends. I'm also on the swim team, so I have to shave EVERY TIME I shower!!\n\n\\- Dread my after-shower routine! After how chill the actual shower is, it can be an exhausting prospect to walk up the stairs, put on lotion and pajamas, wash your face, other girl stuff, etc.\n\nHope this helps!

If you have curly hair like me you really only need some cold water (no shampoo or conditioner), keep doing that for 2 weeks and your hair will always be smooth and have more volume. Every once in a while of course use some shampoo and conditioner, but leaving your hair alone and letting it do its thing will be very healthy for it.",

Soak your head in the water on ice cold until your whole head tenses up and it's almost unbearable. Then switch it to hot water until it becomes too hot to stand. Repeat this for 10-20 minutes. \n\nNot sure why it works but I'm guessing it has to do with tensing and relaxing your muscles.

If I do my skin care routine after, that's another 15 minutes to make sure everything is set right. Then if I'm doing make up, depending on the occaision that could be another 30 minutes.\n\nI break my self care up into specific days. If a girl uses the excuse that she's going to wash her hair that night and is busy, she's busy.\n\nAll of this being said, my usual shower routine is 15 minutes. I have a cowash hair cleanser (conditioner that cleans your scalp) and a body wash for everyday. I only have to shave my body hair once, maybe twice a month (I'm so lucky), and my skin routine is a bit much (I admit) but I do it before bed or to protect from sun damage and pollution (like make up and sunscreen).",

People don’t bother you in the shower so I tend to really use up that hour to the fullest. I drink tea, I email people back, I write  stories. It’s a relaxing experience. >< it will soon end as my school pays for the water I use and I’ll have to shorten it to 30 or even 15. So yeah :3 super fun shower time.

At least in my experience, it’s a fair assumption that he, at most spends 2/3rds of that hour, actually showering, but guarantees that there will be 0% hot water at the end of it. Id assume he is not the only one, the trick is to learn what the sound of the shower water hitting the wall when no one is in there. You might be a victim of similar malfeasants. If so wait until they are in the shower and turn off the hot water tank. Thank you for reading my TED talk.",

            "text": "So, I’ve got a set of answers...\n\n1) I suffer from severe dry eye syndrome, and when I’m not wearing my giant af scleral lenses (Boston Scleral Lenses [PROSE(R) Lenses]). These are highly uncomfortable RGP (Rigid Gas Permeable) lenses that cover almost the entire exposed surface of my eye. It’s the best option I have to function like a normal human. High-humidity environments are the only place my eyes don’t feel like they are being chemically burned when I’m not wearing my scleral lenses or literal prescription Speedo(R) swim goggles (yes, this makes me look as goofy as you’d think). I try to make due outside of wearing either of these options, but I can’t make it more than 10-15minutes before it hurts so much I can’t take it anymore. I’ve primarily decided to take the stance “F Captain Planet and Gaia” when it comes to water conservation because of this condition I have. I’ve also got a steam unit in the shower room, so it’s quite enjoyable to prolong my time there. I’ve had a >$1,000 USD water bill within a 1-month timeframe before. That one hurt so much that I haven’t willingly passed $300/month in awhile.\n\n2) My shower is 11’x7’ (335.28cm x 213.36cm), so it’s more of a shower room within the bathroom than it is just a shower. Anyway, I’ve got a 5’ (152.4cm) wide bench in there, and I also have 3 Children’s bathtubs that come with a built-in detachable stool that I often remove and place in front of the shower seat. Why do I do this? Because I sit on the stool and put my plate on the shower seat. My plate? That’s right, I eat my breakfast in there with hot water hitting my back because that’s what I classify as a sincere luxury considering my lot in life. What all do I eat in the shower? I’ve had pork chops, omelets, egg sandwiches, cereal (captain crunch, pops, fruity pebbles, etc.), toasted bagels with fake cream cheese (b/c the universe thought it would be fun to give me a good sensitivity when I was 20 y/o), ice cream sandwiches, popsicles (cause it gets hot in there with the steamer running for an hour), and honestly, the list goes on. I’ve even eaten the Vietnamese soup Pho 🍜 because my MIL made it for me (Free Life Hack: get an Asian in-law if you’re not Asian. Another of life’s luxuries). Drinks have included smoothies, flavored bubble water, coffee, OJ, coconut milk, Che ba Mau, chocolate cashew/oat/soy milk, wine, and even mixed drinks. In addition to the shower space, inside this 11’x7’ room is a 5’x5’ Japanese soaking tub that’s 30” deep, so I also spend quite a bit of time with in there.\n\n3) My wife and I also have 3 kids (all under 3 thanks to some MoMo twins), and since we’ve got three bathtubs, we take a good number of family showers in there. The girls are both almost 3 months, and the boy is 2.5 y/o. He plays with his water toys in there (pouring water is his jam) while we bathe the girls, ourselves, and then him. Then we just hangout in there.\n\n4) I do a decent amount of Reddit reading in there because my phone is waterproof-ish, and I stick it in a waterproof phone bag. It’s super frustrating to type on a wet, capacitive touchscreen, with or without the bag. Using the phone in the bag requires so many horrible autocorrect fails be corrected before sending a message that it may be one of the key factors increasing the duration of my showers. For the record, I can’t dictate because it’s too echoey in the shower room secondary to all of the antiqued mirror tile I put on all the walls that aren’t a giant pane of glass (background: the idea was to see boobies everywhere. It fogs. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Looks cool as hell when not in use though, so it worked out). \n\n5) My wife and I also have a good amount of adult fun time in there. If you bring a yoga mat, the tile doesn’t hurt too badly. Most all of the positions are possible in there! More importantly for me though, I can have sex without role playing as Michael Phelps when I don’t have my contacts inserted. My wife says it doesn’t matter, goggles or not, “[I’m] still sexy as ever.” She very well may believe what she’s saying, but I still get embarrassed wearing goggles. We all have our insecurities, right? I’ve also seen myself in a mirror though, so I’ll take it if necessary but would rather be goggle-free. Anyway, I push for shower sex frequently because I figure if I get laid in the shower, it does not necessarily mean I won’t get laid outside of the shower too. 🤓😏😘\n\n6) This last one is something that happened once...\nWe’ve been together for 18 years, so we’ve been through some stuff— like that one time with both developed SERIOUS “both ends at the same time food poisoning” while staying the evening at her 2 bedroom, 1 BATHROOM apartment. Being the gentleman that I am, I let my then gf take the toilet. Honestly, in hindsight, I came out miles ahead. I mean, I had a bidet with my accommodations (shower head with a hose). Comparatively speaking, maybe the goggles during sex aren’t all that bad given our charming past personal boundary issues? Anyway, the point is, sometimes a person is in the shower, laying down, hot water gently falling upon his/her naked body for several hours because he/she is unable to move, throwing up his/her insides whilst pooping his/her brains out. I know you wish you were me now!!\n\n\nI’m fortunate to have the ability to use a shower the way I do. Thank goodness I made it out of graduate school and earned some money before I did something regrettable. Chronic ocular pain sucks. Long showers give me a respite from my physically miserable existence. I’m confident Captain Planet and Gaia will forgive me for my abundant utilization of an ever increasingly limited resource. Since I can’t ask them, I’m just gonna continue under the working theory that I’m right about them. Anyway, since I’m kind of screwed and need this to make my life bearable, y’all should use less water. Help even the planetary scale a tad?",

Then people start to listen and the Rolling Stones magazine says that's a good album and we became famous. And we start an YouTube experience where we, now famous, go around the world talking and having some music jam with our favorite musicians.\n\n  \n\n\nHow would be to have so much money that I would be able to put drones in the rainforest and make footages of companies destroying it and then put lot of lawyers to make a case. Also would have to face the authorities, cause they allow that to happen on purpose and they don't like at all someone doing something about.\n\n  \n\n\nHow would be if Netflix or any stream service, accepted my idea of making a sitcom about the street where a grew up. Making everyone a character and do something like Trailer Park Boys with all these people who live here. They're poor to, some unemployed like me, some old without pension or retirement plan. How would that change their lifes? How cool would be when people start to come here to meet these people? I would be the director and also the main character. Would I have to argue with the producers to raise the wages when we reach some popularity? Would the neighborhood became more connected again? Would we reunite to watch it?\n\n  \n\n\nThings like that, and then a proceed to imagine me living them and lots of other adventures.",

After a long day of grueling school and many many hours of school work at home it was a reward. I could be alone and relax.\n\nI’d just stand there. Or sit there. Usually just change between the two positions. Sometimes bring my phone in with me or a book (keeping the water on my back). It was mostly just nice sitting there. Great for meditation or prayer or just... existing in a moment. Gave me time to think and it really helped with my anxiety. Was a great way to end the day.\n\nIn high school I also got up around 5:30-6:00 AM often and I’d take showers to wake myself up since caffeine has never been my thing. But I’d have to wake up earlier to accommodate showers that would be longer as I was more tired lol. But even in the morning I’d just sit there.\n\n\nI think simply just standing or sitting facing a wall is a very underrated activity.

            "text": "I have low porosity waist length hair. Low porosity means that my hair does not easily absorb water. If I take a single hair and drop it in a bowl of water, it will stay afloat. I was shocked when I learned not everyone's hair does that. This explains why I need more time to just wet my hair, then I have to quickly apply shampoo before it starts drying. After shampooing my hair, I put my hair up and wash my body (and face, if I haven't done it before the shampoo). Then rinse from head to toe. Next step is to apply conditioner or mask on my hair, otherwise it will tangle. I brush it to make sure the product is evenly applied, to detangle and remove dead hairs before stepping out of the bathroom. I put my hair up once again and proceed to wash my intimate parts and shave my armpits. The next steps are optional, I might exfoliate my body, shave my legs, exfoliate my feet with pumice stone or some other tool, trim/shave around my intimates. Not to mention rinsing in between. Finally, after letting the product on my hair take effect for a couple of minutes, I rinse it off.\n\nMy minimum is half an hour, but adding the additional steps, it might take up somewhere in between 30 and 60 minutes. Sometimes if I don't feel very well I'll take a bath. I always open the door in the end to let the bathroom dry.\n\nAfter the shower, I use a squeegee to remove the water from the shower glass doors and mirrors. While I'm drying, I clean my ears, brush my teeth, do some skincare, might cut my toenails. Then I put some leave-in on my hair, detangle it with my fingers or brush if needed and let it air dry. The upside of low porosity is that drying is pretty quick.\n\nA shower thought of mine is just how much time and efforts women put into their care routine. I can't wash my hair once a week, I've tried, it doesn't help making my hair less oily, so I usually shower every other day. I don't style my hair, and the only makeup I apply daily is just some mascara.",

(Takes guaranteed 45+ minutes, if I'm not washing my hair it will be more like 20.) I have long thick hair that takes forever to thoroughly wash and rinse, and I have to pay special attention to my scalp if I want it to not get itchy between washes. \n\n- thoroughly wet hair\n- turn off water and shampoo scalp/roots for 5 or so minutes\n- turn on water to rinse shampoo\n- turn off water and spread conditioner everywhere, have to finger-comb the lengths quite a bit to make sure all strands are coated\n- pin hair up to keep it out of the way while the conditioner soaks in, and then turn water back on\n- use body wash on genital area\n- take the showerhead out of its holder and get up close and personal while rinsing to make sure no soap gets left in any crevices\n- wash hands with bar soap bc I'm a germaphobe and paranoid about getting genital germs on the outside of my bottle of body wash when I grab it again\n- use body wash on feet\n- again with the germaphobic hand washing\n- turn off water and use body wash on the rest of my body, in the following sequence: upper torso, lower torso, legs, arms, armpits. (I stop and get a new squirt of soap between each area because I don't like using a loofa or anything so I need to re-up on the suds periodically)\n- turn on water to rinse off soap\n- bend forward with head upside-down so I can rinse conditioner without getting it all over the body I just washed. (rinsing conditioner takes a long time to do thoroughly in hair as thick as mine, usually my neck is sore by the time I'm done)\n\nI have no patience for hygiene tasks and the niceness of hot water doesn't please me longer than a few minutes, so I really am trying to rush through this whole process and I wish it didn't take so long. People seem to think I'm just wasting time in there but idk how I could be any faster. Someone please help me budget this, my family is dying",

Its more well-known cousins are trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) and onychophagia (nail biting disorder).

Rent every apartment in that fucker for enough to keep it running well, pay the taxes, and make a small annual profit, and using that profit to buy up the surrounding properties so that, instead of jumping the price by improving it, I could slowly start to lower the value and get people who need housing in. \n\n\nThis spiraled out of control to me making deals with local neighborhood gangs to sell pot out of a legal dispensary and reduce crime because I lobbied the state I live in to fully legalize recreation Marijuana usage. \n\n\n\nThis is not a rare occurrence.

            "text": "I’ve only ever spent an hour showering maybe 5-10 times in my whole life but there are a couple of very legit reasons for it.\n\n1.\nI’ve lived with clinical depression for over 20 years. Many times when I’m going through a deep depressive episode, I will stand under the water totally spaced out for the first few minutes. It’s something only people who live with certain mental illnesses can fully understand, but it happens to a lot of us. \n\nAlso part and parcel of depression is sometimes not showering/bathing at all for extended periods (up to a week at my worst, but for some it can be much longer). COVID life only added to that tendency, though on the plus side the world has probably saved a shitload of water in the last 15 months from fewer showers. Plus, when you’re not leaving the house, who cares as long as your hair looks nice for the odd video call?\n\nWhen one showers less often, one typically also neglects certain aspects of personal grooming for longer than usual as well. Chief among these for me, and most other women, is removal of body hair...which  brings me to the other reason why I can easily spend the better part of an hour in the shower.\n\n\n2.\nI am a hairy gal. Yep, I’m shoutin’ it out for all to hear. There are a ton of us out there but you would never know it because we spend hours upon hours shaving, waxing, sugaring, tweezing, lasering, and epilating excess hair off of our bodies so as to appear presentable in everyday life (calm down radfems, I know we don’t *have* to be hair-free, but I choose to be).\n\nIn the summer, I have to be shaving my legs at least every 2 days or else they become stubbly. I’m fair-skinned and I have medium-dark hair. It’s not super coarse, thankfully, but there’s plenty of it and it’s visible. My arms are just as bad so I shave them every 2-3 weeks as well. Yes, my forearms and upper arms, not my armpits; though of course I shave those too. Oh, did I mention the bikini area? Also my big toes (quite hairy LOL), and my upper lip. When I have the money and places are open I get waxed or sugared but 95% of the time shaving is the easiest and most economical choice.\n\nYou can imagine that shaving one’s entire body (essentially) would take a while. Add in extra hair growth from an extended period of not shaving - due to depression, cold weather, dry and sensitive skin prone to nicks, all of which I deal with - and you’ve got the perfect recipe for a long shower.\n\nSure I could, and often do, spread the shaving out over a few showers to save water but sometimes I have no choice but to do it all in one go. And y’know what? I don’t feel guilty about it. When I’m that far down in a depressive funk, it’s an amazing victory to have a shower and I revel in that feeling. Too, if I don’t shower for a week, that equals about an hour’s worth of time and water I’ve saved (20 mins 3 times a week when I’m more healthy). Some people do 20 minutes or more every single day (20mins x 7days = 140 minutes per week showering), so I’m sure as hell not gonna fret over one 50-60 minute shower.\n\n————-\n\nAll of ^^ this ^^ to say that for some of us an hour in the shower is not wasteful but necessary. It can be the reset we need to try to take on the rest of the day, week, or month when we’ve just been shut off for a while. \n\nShoutout to all my fellow Sasquatch girls! Where ya at?! 😄\n\nEdit: formatting",

His work colleagues and other friends came to look for him, the mail was piling up. His phone had always power, but no one would pick up or answer messages.\n\nTurns out he had a 3 month depression episode where he hid in the cellar of his parents and just told nobody.",

            "text": "Wow, I do shower for an hour and had absolutely no idea people who have long showers don't spend it all washing?!?\nI enter shower, ensure I am wet all over (thick hair can take some effort to get water all the way through it). Then shampoo my hair, rinse it. Sometimes if I've been having a particularly hormonal week and my hair is super oily I'll give a quick secondary shampooing to just my roots. Bear in mind that each step there still has the thick hair issue so rinsing and lathering all takes time to actually get through my hair rather than just sit on the outside layers. Then I squeeze a bit of the water out of my hair to start applying conditioner from the tips towards the roots, this part is kind of a moment of peace for me so I like to be a bit slow and gentle about it. This would be the time that I spend thinking the most I guess. \nWhile my hair conditions I'll shave my armpits/legs/bikini in that order because each step is progressively longer so if I know I've taken a particularly long time I'll skip the next one. i.e, it takes around 1-2 minutes to nicely shave both armpits so I always do them, but it can be 2-3 minutes per leg So if I've had to shampoo twice for example, I'll stop there, but I might shave my legs but then not my bikini area. After that I'll rinse my conditioned hair - which takes time because I hate the feeling of conditioner drying in my hair so I rinse very, very thoroughly. Then I spend anywhere from 1-5 minutes cleaning my body and cleaning my face. Always scrubbing my armpits, usually scrubbing my feet. I can save a lot of time by not washing my legs though because I have really extreme eczema that will flair up any time I start scratching them, so typically I skip them all together or just the  rub shower gel around with my hands.\nThe whole shower takes around 35-40 minutes on average, then I'll spend anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour drying my body in a stupid tedious patting motion (thanks to the aforementioned eczema there's no luxury of rubbing my skin with the towel or letting any water air dry off of me). But the drying usually happens in my room so at least it's not all time spent using the bathroom.",

Then I do another set of shampoo because the first one kinda “activated” the cleaning of my hair and then rinse, then use body wash in my private areas to clean them up. Then I was my hands with the running water and brush my hair a bit again because all the scrubbing of shampoo gets my hair messed up.

I spread a fist of soap over my body and scrub from neck to ankle. This actually takes long enough to shut off the water, but I like the heat and rinsing in sections. This is when my nails get cleaned, so I can hand wash my delicates. I then might have to shut the water off and scrub a second time. It feels so good when your skin is in full flush, both from being so clean and from the scrubbing. If I shave there needs to be some time with cold water; I get goosebumps too easily to just shave in warm water, it would be a waste of effort.

If I stand for too long, especially in the shower, my blood pools in my legs (they turn red, then purple. Also, very much dizziness and I'd rather not faint in the shower again), I generally don't tolerate standing for long due to joint instability and I am chronically fatigued.\n\nThen again. My average per day is 20 minutes because I only shower twice a week (showers are exhausting). Sometimes I'll do most of it in the bathtub and then rinse the last bits in the shower.\n\nHair care routine is so extensive because it saves me a lot of work the rest of the week. I don't get bed hair. Only have to run my fingers through my hair to get rid of some tangles and pin it up if I go out (to keep my mask in place, my ears are super floppy, mask will just fall off my face). I'm planning to get a silk sleeping cap to prevent the tangles and frizz for even less work.\n\n\nAnyway, that's shower things. When I turn off the shower I first squeeze a lot of water out of my hair, then I grab a towel and start to slowly dry off. Gotta be careful because if I slip and fall I'll dislocate a whole bunch of things and need to put those back in and take a lot of rest in the days after to not aggravate the injuries.\n\nLife with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and comorbidities is fun /s",

And then at that point I will sit down in the tub, and turn the water to the hottest it will go to further enjoy the rest of the hot water on my achy body. It's just a really nice way to relax and wind down after a long day. Usually by 20 mins all the hot water is used up(luckily it's only me and my SO so it's not awful that I do that, and our utilities are included in rent so water isn't my problem.)",

Then it’s what I imagine Japanese zen  shower style would be, first meditation using some semi wim hoff practices to relax and cleanse the mind,  followed by cleansing the body fully and methodically starting with the hair and finishing with a good foot scrub / massage. Once mostly clean I go from lounging wide out Sumo Samurai style on my shower bench to turning the water from hottt to mostly cold and as the water slowly starts to get colder I stand to stretch, and wash / scrub my face. Once I’m clean and the cold starts to creep in, I set it back to hot once again and start to place stuff back in its spot ending with moving my shower bench to the far side of the shower area to dry. Finish with a good shave with a sharp blade and I’m a whole new person in no time flat.",
