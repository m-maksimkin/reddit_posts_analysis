Like if an electrical engineer gets really excited talking about some electrical engineering related problem they'd like to work on, or if someone who already had a PhD in psychology goes on about other questions in psychology they wish they'd had longer to investigate, it's kind of wholesome to know they get paid to do what they love.\n\nAnother kind of person is someone who has no fucking clue. There is two subtypes: people who are passionate about everything and can't choose just one thing who rattle off a half dozen disparate areas rapid fire, and people who are passionate about nothing and can't think of anything more torturous than having to study anything for years. I find the latter subtype very sad and I sometimes feel bad for them, as they're often depressed I think, but other times I think they are just people who don't/didn't like school, or they like working with their hands or doing something active more.\n\nThen there are total oddballs that give you really weird answers that you didn't even imagine were options. One woman said she would like to go undercover and study sex workers. My favorite answer was a sofware engineering coworker who answered immediately with a dreamy look on her face, \"Arthurian legends.\" After I heard her explanation I wanted to learn about the legends of King Arthur too.\n\nThe second best part about this question is not only does it give me a lot of information about my date/coworker/new friend, but then when they turn the question back on me I get to talk about how much I love math.",

The response that I get is genuine because they have to think about  the answer and it is therefore very likely the thing that is currently on this persons mind the most is what they will bring up. The answer tells me soo much about who they are..\n\nA few days ago a guy came over that my roommate knows for a drink and dinner. He brought a girl along that was a bit quiet, so I asked her that question. She answered \"my song is finally finished\". Turns out she studied music and wants to make music for movies a la Hans Zimmer, but never talked about it with anyone outside close relatives because of a crippling fear to fail.

I loaded modern warfare on my stepdads ps4 but I could only access warzone.  I downloaded the multiplayer packs and everything but it needed the credit/debit card of my uncle as a two factor authentication, but he didn’t want to put his card on that PS4, only mine, making modern warfare restricted.  So flash forward a couple of months and I get my PlayStation back and put in modern warfare but I run into the same problem.  I downloaded the multiplayer packs except this time it didn’t ask for the card and all it says it installation suspended.  If anyone has solved this problem can you please share the solution.",

Pay attention to their body language. Pauses or shifty eyes, changes in vocal tones or weight distribution. \n\nAnything that induces changes in body language can tell you a lot about them. Moving around can indicate that they are uncomfortable, or that they are excited. If they don't answer right away and start looking around, or at the very least look away from you could indicate they don't normally think about this and you caught them off guard. And for learning about them, this is good. They would be less likely to intentionally lie or tell a false truth.\n\n2.) Pay attention to their answer. What is their priority? Do they buy a house? Party? Quit their job? What kind of house do they buy? How big and lavish is it? What are some special things they say they might buy? \n\nThe order of which they buy things can tell you a lot about their ideas of priority. Homes are good indicators that the person thinks at least a little about the long term, since a home is a big investment and usually a one off thing. If they look to buy big, expensive homes or cars, you can rest assured that they do not concern themselves with long term costs, or how they will maintain this new lifestyle. Since it's all hypothetical to begin with, don't try to justify their answers because it's possible that their ideal \"self\" would do this but if it actually happened, they might do things differently or not at all.\n\nOverall it's a fun 'what if' question. And what if questions are excellent at being able to open people up to discuss things that they otherwise might not.

(Does it make it or break it?) So here's a few examples:\n\nMake it or break it, they're perfect for you in every way EXCEPT they always wear the color green. They will never not wear the color green. Different shades of green are fine, but every single piece of clothing they will ever wear for the rest of their lives will be at least 95% green. Even at like funerals.\n\nMake it or break it, they only eat pizza ever.\n\nMake it or break it they will never drink.\n\nMake it or break it, for one day once a month, every month on the exact same day, they leave town for the whole day. But they never tell you where they're going or what they're doing, and they never will. If you ask them about it, they say \"you just have to trust me.\" If you try to sneak and find out what they do every month, bam relationship over, you're dead to them.\n\nMake it or break it whatever they eat, they drown the whole thing in ketchup, and they always will. Even ice cream. They carry around a little travel ketchup bottle just in case they eat at a place without ketchup. They'll never change.\n\nMake it or break it they hate animals.\n\nNSFW: Make it or break it they've sucked 500 dicks.\n\nMake it or break it they want an open relationship.\n\nMake it or break it, whatever thing you're most passionate about, no matter how hard you practice at it, they will always naturally be better than you (bonus: and they don't really even care about the thing they're good at, it's just kinda meh to them).\n\nThese are examples I've come up with collectively over time while playing with people. They can be serious or goofy scenarios and you can play with anyone. It's a super fun game that you can pull out any time it starts to get awkward, and eventually you and the person are going back and forth coming up with new Make It Or Break It scenarios.

For instance, he was in his mid-twenties, living in NYC, and had somehow avoided ever paying a nickle in rent. Like not once in his life. I personally witnessed him not only refuse to pay his landlord for six months, but also walk away with $3,000 compensation when the matter went to court. From there he ended up in a free pad provided by a real estate broker who hired him on the spot while he was looking for an appartment. Seriously. I've never seen anyone so consistently fall ass first into a basket of rose petals as this dude.\n\nBut that's about the time I lost contact with him because he went full time into real estate brokerage. Which was just as well because he wasn't really a very good employee. He wasn't dangerously incompetent or anything, just kind of slow and lacking any sense of hustle. I kept him on just because he was so entertaining and had this ability to keep everyone else's morale up. We called him \"the Jam Burner\" because he would fixate on certain bands, and play these really badass tunes, but play them so frequently that everyone would be completely burned out by the time his focus shifted. \n\nAnyway, he would go around asking these asinine questions of everyone, as though he was conducting a Heathers poll. What's your favorite animal? What's your second favorite animal? What's your favorite body of water? How would you describe it? Would you rather have a yacht or a sport car? Would you rather have an asshole on your elbow,  or an elbow on your asshole?\n\nHe had graduated college with a psychology degree, so I was aware that he was just probing us all, but I like to think I actually learned a lot about MYSELF from his inquiries. I often think about him warmly. I hope you're doing well, Will, you mystifying, jam burning leach.",

Sometimes people just have interesting answers, and sometimes they don't. It's fun to ask strangers as it pulls them out of the standard \"how are you, I'm fine, have a good day\" scripts we all say.\n\n2) What are your hobbies and interests? Hobbies are a thing you do for enjoyment, whereas an interest is something you like or find interesting and maybe keep up with intellectually, but take no further action on. Hobbies show what someone does to relieve stress and enjoy themselves, interests can become fun talking points with people. Examples: I homebrew soda, paint miniatures, and rock climb as hobbies, but I have a keen interest in rocketry and nuclear fusion reactors. I *do* the first 3 things and *don't do* the last two.",

I ask them if they could have a superpower, what would they choose; if they were a color, what would they be and why; and what is the nerdiest thing they have done and if they liked it.\n\nExplanations as to why I ask these things:\n\nThe superpower question is a good \"we just met question\". Depending on the answer, I can explore why they picked that specific power, how they would use it, and compare my chosen power to help feed the conversation if necessary. It's good for groups, too, because then other people can chime in. \n\nThe color question is a bit more personal. Notice the question isn't \"what is your favorite color\" its \"what color would you BE\". It gives an insight to the person's perceived personality and their values. For example, if they pick yellow and say that it's because it is a bright cheerful color and that is how they describe themself, that tells me a lot. Like the super power question, I can also make conversation out of this one. \n\nFinally, they question about the nerdiest thing they have ever done. I'm a big nerd, and there are few typical nerdy things that I haven't done. Usually, people are hesitant to admit they like anime/D&D/star trek/math/whatever. However, I have done most of these things or at least know about a lot of nerd culture and can carry on a conversation about it for a long time. So I have found that when I get people to open up about their nerdy interests, they get a little more relaxed and open. It gives me a good insight into their interests so I can get to know them better, and then they feel more comfortable because I'm not going to judge them for their interests. (it should be noted that I don't find most these things actually \"nerdy\", but I think society has defined some things as more nerdy than others, so I call them nerdy to help people know what I'm talking about).",

It’s even a part of my voicemail message: “Leave your name, number, and favorite color and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can!” \n\nTurns out your intimidating boss isn’t so scary after you hear him adorably describe why an exact shade of green is his favorite. My mom’s favorite color is fuchsia or magenta, and hearing her say it so excitedly every time (evvvery time) gives me joy. Even telemarketers leave their favorite color sometimes, and I like to think it makes them smile. \n\nIt’s less about the specific color and more about what they say. Are they really specific? Is it something you didn’t expect? Does their reason have something to do with a certain memory? \n\nIt’s a somewhat silly but beautiful jumping off point, no matter how well you know someone.

It's a challenging industry to become specialized in, but most people start in the same place: usually young, inexperienced, box-pushers who just act as hands on set.  \n\nYou'll find these people in the music, film, television, live event, and broadcast industries, and one of the jobs they will undoubtedly be asked to do once the event is over and cleanup starts is to coil cable. Power cable, video cable, audio cable, data cable... there's usually a lot of the stuff around after a job finishes up, and it all needs to go back into road cases or onto storage hooks.\n\nThe newbies almost always do this incorrectly their first, or even first few times if they aren't caught out quickly. And it's very likely that *you* coil cable wrong, too.\n \nYou know how your headphones always get tangled up in your pocket? Ever experienced the joy of a twisted, kinked, power extension cable that constantly knots itself up when you're trying to use a drill or a saw? Ever tried to run out a length of rope and ended up with spaghetti that you have to spend a bunch of time picking through? If you've ever been frustrated stuff like this, then you may benefit from learning the [Under/Over coiling technique, which this page explains quite well](https://www.point-sourceaudio.com/2018/01/25/how-to-properly-coil-microphone-cables/). It'll not only extend the life of your cables (sometimes dramatically), but will make storage and handling easier, too. \n\nSo! My question to get to know people in my industry better is, simply: what was the first time you learned about Under/Over cable coiling? \n\nThe answers are usually funny stories about their younger years, when some salty old road hand asked them to clean a pile of cable, only to come and check on them a few minutes later, usually to find them tangled in a rat's nest of messy black spaghetti. It usually brings a smile, a laugh, and then the realization that they've been doing this for *far* too long as they settle back into the ennui.",

Note that I’m not talking about broad stereotypes like “you listen to pop so you’re boring”, but more little details.  For example, one of sisters doesn’t like complicated, loud, or otherwise overwhelming music as a rule—she likes calmer stuff with thoughtful lyrics. She’s a very anxious person and a musician herself, so I think her taste in music reflects on her desire for peace and to grow as an artist by picking apart and analyzing the work of others. The other likes classics—stuff our mom and dad and grandparents listened to. She’s very empathetic and has a fierce love for her family, and I think music helps her connect with them when they’re away.  My dad’s music is all acoustic guitar and lyrics about relaxing in nice weather with your loved ones (that man LOVES Jack Johnson), which is what he’d do all the time if he could help it. I listen to bits and pieces and odds and ends from all different genres and eras and my library is constantly shifting and expanding, which I think reflects the fact that I’m curious almost to a fault and constantly need to be experiencing new things to feel content. \n\nI also think “I’m not really into music” is an equally interesting response, because for a lot of people, music is a way to engage with complex emotions or experience catharsis as well as to just have a good time or enhance an already positive experience/improve a negative one, and if you’re not into music you must get all that stuff from something else, which I will also be interested to hear about, and will also tell me something about them.",

Unfortunately for us, we didn't really check the weather forecast and the temperatures dropped so we were all freezing during the night. We also put our tents on a small incline, and it started getting windy/raining. So our tents came loose and we slid down. Basically the point is, we all go miserable sleep. I woke up god knows how early just before sunrise and my buddy had made a fire and handed me a cup of coffee. It was the combo of lack of sleep, sore, wet, cold, but getting to drink a warm cup of coffee and enjoy a sunrise with friends after a night of suffering together that made it the best cup of coffee.",

Sometimes I get a reply as in a job interview because the other person is nervous or has never thought of it, so I throw a joke like “very good you’ve been selected for the job, now tell me on a more personal level”, it’s not really funny but it releases the tension and makes the other person really think.\n\nThank you for reading, I hope this helps!",

Most people are, apparently, very humble about their dreams.\n\nI don't know, I like to serve both of these questions in a fairly casual way and they work best that way.

For instance, I knew that people who didn't have an answer the next day weren't going to be any fun to be around, and those who deliberately picked another \"professional\" wrestler's entrance music (and described their signature moves during the entrance) were either going to ace the class or bomb out in the first module; there was no in-between with those guys.  Some people just picked their favorite songs, which told me their taste in music and told me a good-sized chunk about their personality, and the one person who put a lot of psychological thought into their choice were probably going to be the honor grad.  \n\n\nGranted, the above doesn't have any documented psychological basis, and the first time I gave the \"assignment\" it was out a joke, but it kind of became my traidition and I started noticing trends in the responses.",

What do you think, how do you feel?\n\n4. You're looking up at the sky, you see a flying bird. What bird is it, what emotions are feeling? \n\nNow slow down, take your time & really think long/hard about your emotions & what actions you would do in the following scenarios:\n\nA. Its evening time, you're lost in the woods, you see a cabin with lights on in the distance. How do you feel about this situation and what do you do?\n\nB. You're standing behind an infinitely tall and wide wall with a small hole behind which you see an oasis. What do you feel and what do you do?\n\nC. You’re in a fog, there's a grey haze in every direction. How do you feel and what action would you take?\n\nD. You're in a desert, completely exhausted & thirsty, suddenly you see a water jug. What do you do? \n\n\n.\n\n\n\nHow you answered these questions reveals something about yourself on a subconscious level. For instance, the bird I saw was a Crow and it’s trying to pluck my eye out.

Ie, do they just have outdoor dogs or cats that they consider working animals more so than pets, or do they consider pets every bit as important as human members of their family, or do they fall somewhere in between. If they do have pets, those pets include cats (or possibly even if they don't include cats, but they do include a whole menagerie of other rescue animals), if those pets are mostly or strictly indoors, spayed/neutered, and they consider them family... then chances are I'm gonna like that person a whole lot more than someone who doesn't tick those boxes.\n\nThen asking about hobbies is just an easy, obvious way of seeing what we have in common. If someone's hobbies include crafts, certain outdoorsy things (ie hiking, kayaking, cycling, gardening), and/or reading or watching the same types of books and shows I enjoy, then we probably have enough in common to pique my interest. On the other hand, if their hobbies are more along the lines of spectator sports, video games, other outdoorsy things (ie hunting, fishing, four-wheeling, motocross), and reading/watching things I have no interest in, then they're probably gonna turn out to be someone I have very little interest in getting to know further. If they fall somewhere in between, then whether I want to know more will depend on just where and how they fall between... or if they fall totally *outside* those lines -- say they have less common hobbies, or hobbies I have never even heard of before, then I'll probably want to ask more questions to find out more information about them, until I can decide whether they're interesting enough to me to keep going. \n\nBeyond those two things, most of the information I want to know about someone new is going to have more to do with personality, attitude, intelligence, competency, politics/religious/social views -- which are all either things you find out by either observing, more so than asking about them directly, or they're things it's generally considered rude to ask about, so you have to wait for them to volunteer that information rather than via point-blank questioning. \n\nI might ask other things too, like where they're from, what their work history is like, where they went to school, etc... but unless the answers to any of those questions are outside the usual, expected ones, that's typically more just small talk than stuff I'm genuinely interested in finding out.",

It's a fave question of mine because people reveal so much of their lives, their dreams, their potential, what they consider important in life, etc. You can actually see them looking off into the distance dreamily, thinking of their old ambitions and pondering their life path. I even managed to distract a psychiatrist who was treating me with this question, he spoke of his own life for a good 15 minutes before pulling himself together. \n\nMy favorite response was when this very strong female character in my life, who was a teacher responded that she always wanted to join the Air Force but her father refused to let her so she had to marry, have kids and be a teacher. She said she would never trade her current life for anything but I could instantly see her potential in that role, it made perfect sense and fully utilized her passion and personality traits. That question allowed us to bond pretty well. She saw a lot of potential in me and seemed to see some part of herself in me afterwards.\n\nI usually ask this from full-grown adults in steady employment btw. It's amazing how few of us actually achieve our teenage ambitions, and I always see them in a different light after hearing what they actually wanted to be.",

It's a big empty area as far as the eye can see so you can't use your environment at all. They spawn every 5 seconds 10 meters away from you and run towards you. The bodies do not disappear (meaning you can use them as you wish). They have no conscience, their only goal is to kill you. No you cannot survive, you will be killed by them eventually.\nThis is a good one, especially in groups lol. Some people answer \"idk like 5\" and some people discuss their whole plan and what they do with the bodies.",
