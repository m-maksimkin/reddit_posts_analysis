A house that a local family lived in got sold last year they put like 100-200k into it after buying it for 320k or something. And now it's renting for 2800$ a month. That is a lot for a town that has only a hand full of jobs that could sustain that cost. Lucky me that house is not very far from a home I own so it is raising my property values a lot. However I really just would like my town to go back to being a community and not just a vacation spot for people from Texas and California to hang out in. It really lost a lot of the small-town charm and locals are kind of just going away because it's becoming too expensive to rent and if you own property it's very tempting to sell it and just move somewhere less touristy. The local government is actually pushing it to be this Airbnb town bs they are very greedy and could give two shits about the people they represent.

The pub is full of anti social people resulting no local or tourist visiting it. I mind you, pub culture is very important here\n- Same family recently opened the only cafe in town. Serving cold fucking sandwiches and sugary ready made pastry. No croissant, no fresh produce, no artisan coffee, no craft pastry or baking.\n- We have an artisant bread maker from other town who started to drop sourdough breads of all sorts as you like(they take orders as well), me and my wife along other couple of people wept. I literally cried. Others kept buying toast bread as usual. Cringe\n- The town has one GARDAI(wink) station, its almost empty all days of the week. People park on double yellow lines in front of the guards, no fucks given. Gardai also parks on double yellow\n- Towns children ring bells, do vandalism of all sort and nobody gives a fuck. I am very angry to that anti social behaviour as I know these children will be the next criminals. Meanwhile I open a thread ranting about it, gets deleted by mods lol . Explains the country in general\n- The town society has littering problem of manual workers or school children littering everywhere on lunch times. Reported this couple of times to the council, they debated me against that the town doesn't need trash cans because households thrown their own house trash in it. I guess I am responsible to enforce law. Lol\n\nMany more which cringes me to death because again, the society and the town is very wealthy yet live like animals",

Let me explain. \n\nIn my area of America, Hasidic Jews, the ones that have the curls, wear suits, top hats, fuzzy hats etc, have carved out a little empire in my county and have taken over two cities(more like villages) completely and are quickly moving into the non Hasidic areas. Here’s the problems. \n\n1)They mark their homes as places of worship. This gives them tax breaks. \n\n2)They marry in the temple and not in the state so women can receive benefits. Women are treated poorly in the community and are basically child producing slaves. More kids they have, more money from the government. \n\n3) They build substandard housing that accommodates way too many families. They use shoddy building material and do not build up to code and in many dwellings there are often beds strewn about the house to accommodate multiple families. This is so bad and even killed a firefighter a year ago which became national news. The building owners, who are Hasidic, are getting the book thrown at them for exactly above. \n\n4)The more that move in, the more housing values decrease. These people will often come into neighborhoods and knock door to door offering to buy their houses on the spot, people will begin to sell once more move in and they get out of the county. \n\nIn closing, I will share the worst of the worst when it comes to them. New Square. It is a specific community where only certain Jews are allowed in and nobody else. If you drive there, they block you in with school busses and if you get far enough, people throw rocks at you. They have their own court system and run general stores out of basements. They have a hospital all to themselves and they were fighting for the longest time to keep the water bucket brigade instead of having the local fire department come in. And the worst part about it? It is the only place in the United States that has segregated, repeat, SEGREGATED sidewalks. Men and women are not allowed to walk on the same side.

Must have been about 30-40 of the creepy little things.\n\nAnyway, one day a picture showing several of the gnomes with a ransom note pops up on a local group page. It says they have been taken against their will but will be returned after they complete their missions.\n\nClearly someone took them unoticed  from the garden and was having a bit of a joke. For several years someone or several people (there were suspicions of multiple offenders) proceeded to take pictures of ten of these gnomes in  (a) comprising positions (b) different spots all over town (c) in different outfits (d) engaging in all sorts of other rather hilarious antics. I believe several of them even travelled abroad.\n\nAll the pictures were posted onto the local community group app and private neighborhood social media page. This must have went on for 2 odd years until one day they were returned back to  the owners.\n\nTo this day no one has ever found out who the culprit/s were.\n\nFrom speaking to the couple who owned the gnomes personally they seemed to get a kick out of the gnomes adventures and quite enjoyed the whole thing. I definitely don't think they were responsible but for a while over lockdown etc it provided some light relief and gave everyone a giggle. \n\nI checked for pictures and the page has been closed down I will try to see if any fellow neighbors have some saved.",

One of her kids went on her phone and was scrolling and found nudes on her phone of car salesman. The kid sent it to his friends and the friends sent it to even more people. Now basically the entire town has seen this red headed man nude wearing cowboy boots. Beloved restaurant owner quit and business is no longer booming because he has no cook. Car salesman is getting a divorce and closing the restaurant and this happened only 4 days ago.\n\nEdit 1: Wow! Thank you everyone for the upvotes! This post has more upvotes than the population of my hometown (1.7k)\n\nEdit 2: sorry for the confusion regarding local bicycle. I told this story as if it's to someone in my town who would just understand so that's on me. Reddit we gotta talk, a lot of you are trying to stand up for this lass, good on you, but she's a lady with 21 kids with 19 different lads and all but 4 have a reputation in the town. The 4 that don't are because the fathers have full custody of them. She's really not a very redeemable character in this situation. \n\nEdit 3: a few asked for the photo to be uploaded and what the heck!? Lol you guys are wild!\n\nEdit 4: so the beloved restaurant owner left the car salesmans restaurant partnership because of this fiasco. Some say there was some tension about how the business was ran and some say there was tension because he was cheating on his wife. \n\nStatus Update: the latest rumor off the old grape vine says the restaurant owner got a killer deal from the local real estate guy and will renovate an old closed business downtown into his new restaurant! Fingers crossed because he really knows his stuff.",

Definitely not confusing when you're looking for an address and don't know which house belongs to which part, but you get used to it eventually.\nNot only does the street have enough names yet, but they wanted to rename the section in question after a famous person who went to our town when he was a child.

He went on holiday during the summers.\nNow, since that is the only really famous person we ever had in town (not counting local celebrities), one party in the city council wanted to commemorate him in some way and make our town more attractive to tourists.

So they fought. And fought. Eventually it did not get renamed but it definitely caused some.... friction. \nHonestly it's just hilarious at this point.

An older woman donated her nutcracker collection to the historical society. Something like 2,500 nutcrackers. I think because her kids told her flat out they would dispose of them after she died if she did not make alternate arrangements.\n\nSo, the town decided, well, they had all these nutcrackers on display. This could be good for tourism. We could be known for something.\n\nPeople were bewildered and predictably upset. A lot of townsfolk don't *want* to be the nutcracker town. All the local businesses have been pressured to buy these giant expensive cardboard nutcrackers from the local print shop. They are *terrifying.*\n\nThere's been general outcry. Facebook groups, the whole nine yards. And still the town persists.

I ran inside to grab the pellet gun to scare it off, and it took 5 shots to the side for the damn thing to flee. They were bold as hell.  \n\nNow, we had a mayor who was great, by all counts. He ended up retiring, and some young hotshot took over.

Lost. Their. Minds. We all loved our stray cats. I myself had about 5 regular visitors, one of which my mother took in and spayed and made a housecat. The cats were all spoiled and well loved.  \n\nSo people start protesting and leaving food out even more and in greater quantities. They called the new mayor a cat-hater. He ups the ante and says that anyone caught feeding a stray will spend the night in jail and face a 1000 dollar fine.  \n\nPeople were literally spending the night in jail to express their love for the stray cats. The mayor is literally begging people to use reason. The cat food is ATTRACTING the raccoons and possums and making them bold, people. Just stop feeding the strays so the raccoons will go back to fleeing and eating garbage under the cover of darkness.  \n\nNnnope. People ignored the law and the mayor gave up. I gotta say that neither side dealt with the issue at hand very well.

In high school, there was always this deputy from the sheriffs department who looked after kids in tough places sometimes. He was the liaison officer at the school. He built a lot of relationships with students of all kinds. He would go to everyone’s grad parties, and everyone always saw him as a nice guy you could talk to about anything. You felt you could rely on this man. \n\nIn my case, I used to miss a lot of school after my mother passed away. It became a huge habit to skip school and just play Xbox 360 all the time. Sometimes they would send him to my house to get me to school. Other times, they would have me sit down with him and he would explain to me what could happen if I kept this up. He would ask how my home life is and all that jazz. Of course, my life wasn’t very great. I had no discipline, no rules. I would just do whatever I wanted. I moved in with my father when I was 12, right after my mother died and lived with him up until 17. That’s when my brother took me in. Fortunately, this deputy never did anything to me. I never felt in danger or uncomfortable. \n\nIt turns out, this man was actually bribing male students in tough spots for sexual acts. I won’t say what sexual acts they performed, but it was very very disturbing. The first student came out about a year and a half ago. That ended up inspiring another former student to come out. I heard around town that he was offering to buy one kid a car and other stuff.

It is mostly heard at night, since during the day it is drowned out by the everyday sounds of the city. The authorities have been notified and so far both the water network and geological phenomena have been ruled out. Residents are afraid and insist that it may have something to do with natural gas pipes or the water network. Here are some links. The webpages are all in greek but you can translate them. The sound can be heard very easily on the second and fourth video of the first link, as well as third video of the second link.

So, they decided to install the fancier ones like the borough wanted but refused to turn them on. We had new (ugly) street lights for 3 months before they finally settled things and turned them on around Christmas. \n\nNow, some of the local clubs who decorate the town for holidays are pissed because none of their old decorations fit the new street lights.

This walkway is in great disrepair- it's rusty as hell, creaks and wobbles and students don't feel safe on it, so often they cross the road at the crosswalk. One year they even shut it down citing an investigation into it's structural integrity, but the next year is was reopened without repair. Apparently it passed inspection.\n\nThis has led to many complaints from both sides of the argument- parents who are afraid of the aggressive morning commuters not respecting the crosswalk and potentially hitting their kids, and the morning commuters who complain about the increase in traffic caused by students opting to cross the road instead of going over it. Both are valid- people do whizz by the high school well over the speed limit, and the crossing students do back up traffic for a good hour. It also makes parents dropping kids off at the front door have to wait much longer to turn into the school's driveway.\n\nEveryone wants the overhead walkway repaired for multiple different reasons, but the town refuses, citing budget constraints. Their first solution was to mandate that students use the walkway, and when that didn't work for obvious reasons, they put a cop at the crosswalk to both direct traffic and protect students from the irritable morning driver. I wonder how much that cop costs on a yearly basis when you compare it to the cost of replacing the walkway? Lol.",

Like, they’d let their kid who was way too old to be acting like a hooligan just run around yelling and being obnoxious, meanwhile the mom and dad would just sit there with this odd grin on their faces. Like smiling as if everything’s fine. I know the mom has worked with the youth groups at the church, which is also why this news is disturbing. Turns out, weird mom had been HAVING SEX WITH HER SON!! Apparently for a while now!! I don’t know how it got out, but honestly that’s probably why the kid seemed to be a little off. The whole family always had a strange vibe, and my mom would never let me around them without her there lmao. So yeah, i dunno what “perfect church” did about it, but chances are its a big hush hush type deal because they either sweep things under the rug or make you publicly announce them in front of everyone to admit that you did something wrong. Glad i don’t go there anymore.",

Hearing that he approached the vehicle until he was about 20ft away and noticed a burnt body next to it. He then called 911. Nothing was known about who it was till a missing person was reported later that day, car and body were so burnt no identifying could be done immediately. Two cameras caught the whole thing from local farm grain bins. Video showed the car in the field and then light moving as if it was stuck and trying to get out. Assumptions are the catalytic converter started the fire but no one knows for sure. All happened at around 2 am. Not much controversy but definitely the talk of the town. Funeral for the man was a week and a half ago.",

Turns out she had been doing that for the past 10 years and husband didn't suspect a thing.   Her and the neighbour both ran away together after that got out, and nobody's heard of them since.\n\nThe church had a guest speaker in, who was also very high up on the school's PTA.  Stood up and did an entire pretentious-ass speech about being s*ooooo* christ-like and close to God.  When everyone started leaving, the same women nearly ran over a dude just walking by, blasted her horn, screamed at how she was going to \"beat the shit\" out of him and swung her fist out of the window.  In front of almost the entire church.\n\nThe dentist cheated on his wife with so many women he gave her several STDs.  She's now (understandably) suing the living shit out of him.\n\nMy Dad also cheated on my mom with multiple women and also disappeared to another town.  But my Dad is also the person who is in charge of the Church's Facebook page.

He was taken to the local police station, he apparently was so mad and furious that he had minor heart attack that took him to the ER.\nAfter this incident, the city and the millionaire started slugging each other in court with every lawsuit imaginable.

Owner starts sleeping with one of the waitresses. Everyone in town is talking about it. Especially after he buys her a new car.

People are concerned that having tourists manoeuvring caravans down the steep street will be a recipe for disaster.\n\nDozens of complaints were lodged with the local planning authority, some with quite florid language and even computer mockups of how intrusive the new structures will be.\n\nThe only people in support of it are the family themselves, and the family that runs the pub next door to the caravan site. They keep claiming that it'll boost the local economy, but we have two pubs and no shops. In protest, villagers have started drinking in the other pub.\n\nTo add to the drama, the husband of the family is also on the Parish Council, the people who get the final say on whether the plan can go ahead. There was a village Zoom meeting held with the council, but the council didn't vote on it properly and now district council members have been roped in to back up the disgruntled villagers!\n\nIt's simultaneously very exciting and exceedingly banal; I love it!",

Shortly after 1: a teacher at the local high school took down her U.S. flag, stating that it didn’t represent her and what she stood for (as she had to take down her pride flag); The board had a fit and stated that it was a requirement to hang a U.S. flag in the building (it is, oddly enough). I believe she wasn’t fired, but suspended. She came out later stating that she had received hundreds of death threats from people across the country. 2: in response to all this turmoil, a teacher at a local elementary school decided she would make things worse and show up to the school in black face; stating that the mandate for teachers to be vaccinated was like being back in the times of slavery. \n\nSo, yep. This all happened in the span of 3-4 weeks, late August into late September, 2021. \n\nAs of recently, many of the people have taken to hanging up signs that asked for the recall of our main, conservative superintendent. Voting for the recall ends today. Results may come in within the next few weeks. Odds are, even if he is recalled, the other members of the board will just try to push a new, more conservative superintendent into his position. Until we can vote for an entirely new superintendent, I doubt much will change. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: Education board is hella conservative, teacher showed up in blackface, recall possibly in progress for main superintendent (of education board).",

This was the talk of the town because the wife’s family owned the most popular bar in town, which meant that everybody knew about it almost immediately. The whole thing ended up in court and he was placed on house arrest. The wife stayed with him and even blamed the teenage girl for everything",

This got a significant amount of interest because it tried to put a lot of restrictions on ponds that people were not happy with. \n\nEventually this took so much time and created so much animosity that several of the appointed township officers resigned and were not replaced because the elected board members were split half and half on the pond issue so nobody would agree on anything. A recall election for the Township Supervisor was conducted and he survived it, BUT he was unintentionally incorrectly re-sworn in to office (wrong person performed the swearing in). One of his opposing people on the board discovered this error and intentionally did not say anything until after the date specified in the charter that he needed to be sworn in had passed and then she mounted a legal challenge that he was illegitimately holding office and asked that he be removed. \nThe town rallied behind the sitting Supervisor and made enough noise that he was re-sworn in. He and his wife (clerk) were promptly voted out in the next general election later that year because he kept pushing the pond ordinance that nobody wanted. \n\nIt was a mess for 8-10 months in our township where absolutely nothing got done. I got stuck in the middle because we were trying to get a solar panel installed and there was nobody to approve the site plan or inspect anything. We had it lucky though other people had various stages of home remodels stalled for this long for the same reason and a new desperately needed cell tower was complete and waiting to be switched on pending an electrical inspection for a full year because there was no inspector. \n\nThe pond ordinance remains topic of hot debate and is still not written, but ponds still get dug. 🤷",

They want to build three brand new high schools, with huge emphasis on football fields. We already have three decent condition buildings that need some TLC and adjustments to the roofs to stop water from pooling when it rains.\n\nThey asked for 60 million, which failed as people wanted to refurbish the buildings, not tear down and rebuild. They got the lesser sum of 45 million. During all this COVID business, the money is gone. No one knows where it went. So ignoring the referendum, the school system has reached into emergency funds for a quarter of a billion dollars to rebuild three schools.\n\nThis comes two years after the last Supernintendo was let out of jail for defrauding the Feds, money laundering, and counterfieting. Our school corporation was raiding by FBI and the Secret Service, the superintendent drove the wrong way down a one way street to get away, and a bunch of phone records were discovered and published, including the owner of the landscaping company and his wife demanding more money. In the millions. And someone just below the owner in authority in the business \"committed suicide\" two days before he was to meet with the Feds with evidence. \n\nSo the taxpayers are on the hook for over 325 million dollars as we're still paying for the initial funds and having to rebuild the emergency funds.\n\nSomeone tried to assassinate our superintendent.

Auditors came in from government and found what he was doing was illegal so the whole thing ended up getting stopped.\n\nClosed off a local river that belongs to the town so no one can access it despite it being public land (which means in my country it's available to everyone) and refused to open the gates during summer so people could actually use it.

School 2- the pizzas (the owner of that place owns a successful pizzaria in town). School 3- the Gym.\n\nThe gym isn't really that relevant.\n\nSo the alphas is the dominant school in town. Run by one man (we'll call him Paul) for 25 years. His right hand man we'll call Uno, cuz he's literally the best. Paul the owner also has a son (junior) and wife who help out with the family business. It's literally amazing. I spent most of my childhood and teenage years there, learning how to fight. \n\nAs the years go by, though, things change\n Paul's son is growing up and wants to be more in charge of the business. Junior and Paul often fight and can't stand one another. But that's okay, because Uno, the right hand man, is always there to pick up the slack and teach awesome classes. \n\nBut as the years go by, things are starting to get worse. Let me mention- there's a lot of politics and favoritism in both Paul and Juniors classes. Uno's classes are relatively fair and inclusive. Uno makes sure everyone is included and gets detailed help, regardless of wether or not they're the favorite or not. Like I said, uno is the heart and soul of the place, and without him the whole thing is kind of sour because Paul and Junior aren't very sociable and have little to no people skills, but decent martial arts. My point being, if you're not they're favorite, classes aren't enjoyable for you. \n\nThen all of a sudden Paul sign the place over to Junior. Classes become more like gym classes, and it's more of a mcdojo belt factory than a martial arts school. He's not trying to teach self refense- he's trying to sign up as many kids as possible to make money. \n\nThen I fall out of favor with Paul and Junior. I quit the tournent team. It's been a long time coming- I just wasn't enjoying it anymore. I wanted to do more mma stuff but Paul said I had to stick to point fighting. \n\nAt that point I become a pariah, but it's okay- I'm exclusively going to classes taught by Uno at this point, and when I tell Uno after classes how unhappy I am, he decided l to start his own martial arts school. Me, his girlfriend, and a handful of other students leave with him.\n\nThis causes a shit storm we don't stick around to see. Paul is kind of a narcist and has told his instructors they \"belong\" to him and that he will \"bury them\" if they decide to undercut his business.\n\nUno doesn't care. Opens a small school just outside of town. I have a decent rank and experience at this point, so I'm helping him run the place along with his dad who also does martial arts.\n\nThings are great- Uno even buys his own house and me, his gf and I all hang out and have dinner there, ECT.\n\nThen- Uno's girlfriend goes batshit crazy. Writes him a bad check on the houses accuses him of cheating on her (he didn't) and just has a completell mental break. She's goes from zero to 100, and I'm shouted and screamed at several times for no reason, leaving me in a fragile state.\n\nIt all comes to a head one night when I get knocked out during a sparring match. It was an honest mistake, Uno and I were sparring after hours. But I'm fucked up with a concussion and half conscious. Uno helps me to the car and drives me to the hospital. As this is happening, his gf is calling and texting.him threatening to kill herself if he's not home STAT. Not the first time she's done this, but he's not abandoning me at the hospital and can't go home to make sure she's safe, so he calls the cops and she gets put in a psych hold.\n\nTo make a long story short I lived and Uno and hid gf broke up. A month after their breakup I admit I've always had feeling for uno but didn't want to step in on what was his happy relationship.\n\nWe start dating. \n\nNow his crazy ex gf has gone to the OTHER martial arts school in town (the pizzas). She's starter a smear campaign telling everyone all sorts of crap about her ex uno. We know this because one of Uno's old friends goes there. \n\nDuring this time, one of the old students from the Alphas joins us. Like us, he used to be a favorite but quit tournament team and got tired of being a punching bag. He has a blast with us and we love having him. \n\nFrom them, we learn the Alphas situation has deteriorared- basically all the ranking teens and adults \"volunteer\" ie provide free labor for junior and Paul runs the \"leadership guidance class\" that they all attend which is basically him power tripping the whole time. \n\nAlso- they filed a suspicious PPP loan for $11k with some strange details on it. It's sketchy enough I mentioned it to the gov't tipline because that's taxpayer dollars.\n\nSo yeah- I help Uno run his school, and we've been dating for 2 years now. The police have told his ex not to contact him again, but every now and then we see her around town and she glares at us. \n\nI joke with Uno all the time that even if we break up we have to be friends, because due to the state of politics/karate drama in town I doubt I'm welcome at the school his ex goes to or the school we left. \n\nHit me with any questions you have. It might sound crazy but it's my life lmao.\n\n(Also before you ask- I did not cheat with Uno. She wrote him a bad check for the down payment.on the house and I told him that was fucked up and from there she spiraled into her mental health crisis.).",

There's no helipad or airstrip within 30 miles. Sheriff's office said there was no emergency situation requiring response, no car crash or accident requiring rescue, no flight plans filed from the nearest airports (30 and 45 minutes away). Many of us ran outside on the 2nd or third pass. A few reported they thought it was a military helicopter. The local newspaper investigated and found that a military helicopter did land at the public airstrip at Telluride, CO (a resort town 45 minutes away). It refueled, the pilot and passenger had dinner in town, then the chopper took off around 8 p.m. There was reportedly no signature on the fuel charge, and no one at the airport volunteered any more info. Regional military and air force facilities deny any knowledge. But it would appear it was a military helicopter, I'm guessing piloted by some military asshole who took a woman to dinner in Telluride, had a few drinks, and then took his date on a little joyride over our quiet hamlet with his spotlight on. It's unlikely any more details will be forthcoming.",

It's fairly easy to project when a system like that would hit capacity based on number of people. But anyway, the muni lets everyone know, but there's a ton of people who have bought land or are part way through building based on permits (that the muni approved!!!) to hook up to the sewer system, and those people are SCREWED. Many can't fit septic systems on their lot, so they also can't sell the land. They just have a useless lot or halfway built house that won't ever have working toilets, according to the muni. So yeah it's lawsuit city. The best part is that the council approved a new municipal hall for themselves costing $4 million, which ALSO won't be able to hook up to the sewer now. People have really rallied behind using the $4 million to upgrade the sewer system and pay lawsuits, and let the council remain in their old quarters. It's the most sewage talk I've ever seen and ever hope to see.",

And then a couple of years ago, a town vote determined they were allowed on town streets. \n\nWhich was… mostly fine until COVID which sent a wave of Southern vacationers to our little town. With those vacationers came some really ass behavior. Speeding on the dirt roads through town passing our houses going 55+ MPH, one of them HIT A CHILD on a bike and DROVE AWAY. \n\nYou couldn’t go to local restaurants without hearing the tourists talk about how nice it is that they can DRIVE DRUNK on our town streets and onto ATV trails. \n\nSeveral dogs have been killed, these things are loud as hell and our entire town is annoyed. To make matters worse, a non-zero percentage of tourists have decided that it’s important to bring their politics into town with them. So locals are confronted with flags, getting yelled at if they appear to go against the tourists politics, and crazy amounts of insane social media drama between locals and tourists. \n\nLuckily, a petition in town set this whole thing up for a revision vote. Unfortunately, the opposite group also made a petition which resulted in the worlds most confusing ballot. \n\nBasically the options were:\nBallot A: maintain the status quo (on the dedicated ATV route)\nBallot B: ban on all town streets \nBallot C: allow on all town street \n\nBut then the semantics on how these ballots interacted with were also confusing. One of the town employees releases a notice describing how they interact 4 months before the election.\n\n\nThe election arrived. The outcome is announced. One of the town TRUSTEES starts to spread misinformation about the vote (saying the outcome, which was Ballot A - was invalid because of the combined number for Ballot B and C - which literally makes no sense). A person in town called them out on it, which upset the tourists and resulted in a wild social media backlash from the tourists. \n\n\nAll is fairly calm now, but we will see how the next summer goes. Several of the businesses said they needed the ATV tourism to survive - many of the tourists claimed they won’t be returning since they can’t drive on town streets. \n\n🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️ 🤷\n\nAlso we are a superfund site with no affordable housing and a barely surviving economy and remote workers are invading so there’s that",

He warned me I could be putting myself in danger ..people would come after me etc\nThen he asked me what approach I planned to take... since I used to be an online contributor for a now defunct hip hip magazine and Kendrick's case was getting really no attention at all.. I told him I wanted to interview a few prominent hip hop artists ..get their opinions not just on the kendrick Johnson story but on the unjust killing or black people across the country... but many of my connections were now underground artists and others had just dried up. Peterson put me in touch with black thought of the roots manager... he agreed to be interviewed for the project...Killer Mike agreed to be interviewed for the project...\nI had thought about investing some money in it and getting some investors and turning it into a short video doc. \n\nBut see here is the catch.. my father who I didnt grow up around so much... is a scout for the hs football team at lowndes..and at that time the main suspect was a star football player. Brian Bell..like.. really good football player..he had a scholarship to FSU.. people protested ..they revoked his scholarship...\n\nThe justice department eventually decided to drop charges on bell... who's dad just happened to be an fbi agent at the time of Kendricks murder.\nHell.. bell was fishing at my dad's house one day prior to this all happening..I went over there to see my mom.. and my dad introduced me..\n\nAnyways...the FSU shit was after I quit my project on Kendrick Johnson.. why did I  quit... Dr. Peterson was right \n\nNot even a week after I spoke to him and had emailed back n forth with black thought killer Mike and a few other potential people that agreed to help the project ... what dr Peterson told me came true.\nWhich is odd...because I use an alias on twitter where I was asking most the questions and making connections. Nobody in the small town knew me by that name. Not one single soul.\n\nMy parents started getting harassing calls mainly making threats towards me.. but then it turned towards threats towards my dad's job working with the hs football team which is basically the love of his life even tho he wasnt the best father to me.. I decided to squash the project which I regret till this day because the only way they could have found out who I was and my family tree was via that kids dad being a fed or retired fed and having those connections.\n\nAnyways things got quiet after awhile ...bell went on to play football for Akron and had a decent career.. recently one of his cousins turned a tape into the lowndes county sheriff with someone admitting to killing johnson..to which the asshole racist sheriff shrugged off and said that the cousin was a known liar.\n\nThe case still remains unsolved and is the biggest controversy definitely in that smaller town I grew up in..\n\nThere is now a documentary film about the Kendrick Johnson case ..I've only seen bits of it so far but they probably did a better job than me but hey I tried..\nI just didnt want my work to fuck with my family and make our relationship even worse.. post trump era my dad has gotten worse and turned into a total fucking asshole so I still regret it... but he is still my dad... and football is the only thing we have in common.  Been kinda cool to get to occassionally see nfl stars play in hs over the years but yea.\n\nWatch the documentary if you can. And google kendrick Johnson. Brandon bell Brian bell.. supposedly they were beefing over a girl before it happened to I'd ad.\nThe documentary is on paid platforms like Starz apple TV ..prime..roku TV and you can rent it on YouTube.  Its called finding Kendrick Johnson.\n\nCan watch doc free here \n\nhttps://watcha.movie/movie/finding-kendrick-johnson-2524\n\nNot sure if this allowed if not pls domt delete my post just tell me and I'll take it down.\n\nAfter watching 15 mins of this and seeing he was obviously beat to death I'll never be able to forgive myself for not finishing what I started.\n\nEspecially since I had famous people willing to speak on it. The documentary is excellent so far.\n\nBut Americans listen to celebrities more than the do the president.\n\nFuck.",

And the bloke works for the local undertakers, so I think he also uses his position to reduce costs for the undertakers using the church, and doesn't pass that saving on to the people who use the church through the undertakers, that pure speculation though based on me knowing him and his character.\n\nNot only this, but the couple have actually been the active cause of the church not being able to get more people coming, because the other church in the village and theirs sometimes works together, with joint services, shared advertising, that kind of thing and these two have been really outspoken against greater cooperation with the other church to try and get numbers up, while still being sour over the fact that the church probably won't last another 5 years.",

But even that’s a problem. My late dog and my other dog and all the dogs in that stretch of forest got deathly ill one summer. We had to drive with our poor dog three hours to an actual animal hospital. Most people think Gil did it. But he also contributes to the shelter a whole lot money wise - which is desperately needed.\n\nSo we’re not quite sure what to do with him.",

Since we live in a fairly dangerous place climate-wise, we're fairly interconnected. \n\nThere are several infamous characters, the most unpleasant of whom is this retired dude Jay. He's easily the most aggressive and abrasive person I have ever met. He has begun every conversation we have ever had at an 11, and just works himself up from there, frequently raising his voice to me while I sit silently behind the wheel of my car, waiting for him to finish so I can get into town. \n\nThings Jay cares about: 1) access to his property, and 2) the fact that he spends \"thousands! thousands!\" of dollars \"every year!\" to plow a particular short stretch of road up to his house. Everyone who might ever drive on that stretch of road leaves during the winter, with one exception: me. I moved in less than a year ago, and he has brought this up during every single conversation. I recently offered to give him money, and he insisted it isn't about money, it's about respect, and he wants me to \"work it out\" with him. \n\nHe says he's \"big on favors\" and likes to \"barter.\" He often uses the phrase \"you scratch my back,\" but weirdly doesn't ever include the second half of the saying.\n\nHis wife is infamously banging someone else in the valley, they've been off and on again for years, and are apparently \"open\" but everyone is scandalized that she's sleeping with one of the neighbors (and imo that's pretty fucking shitty of her, and she's actually as creepy as he is based on two encounters with her thus far). \n\nI can't imagine who will ever read this, but recently my car slid off the road and got stuck in a sort of precarious place. I had to leave it where it was overnight, and returned the next day with help, only to find he had snow plowed me in. The last time we spoke in person, he jokingly threatened to push my car off the mountain. In those words. I was furious, and spent hours shoveling the snow plow pile out of the way so the tractor (a very kind neighbor lent us) could pull me out. I would LOVE to share the texts with you if anyone is interested because I'm still pretty pissed about all this.\n\nedit: [the messages](https://imgur.com/a/utfhqRE)",

He moved here from another state, but he grew up in this state, just not here. During his time in other state, he attended school and became a lawyer. This has not been great for him.\n\nAt some point in the past 5 years, Mayor X had worked with an investment group to try to acquire a couple buildings in town. He did not actually follow through on this, but he did distribute presentations to people involved with the project. Somehow, one of these leaked. \n\nThe backlash was really intense and several conspiracy minded folks in town ran with it. There is now at least 1/4 of town that thinks Mayor X is a baby eating satan worshipping liberal Democrat looking to buy up all of town and push them all out and hand the tourism in town over to skiers. The rumor mill has been intense for almost a year.\n\nThen last fall, he and the town board made a controversial vote that upset the conspiracy crowd. They began to look at anything they could dig up on him. Someone noticed he sits for the pledge (and another member of the board citing moral disagreements with the current version of the pledge). \n\n As a result, one of the town board members called 🦊 news lamenting that our mayor is anti-American and so on so forth. \n\nThere was a vote to recall the mayor in the fall. It did not pass. The conspiracy theorists have been oddly quiet ever since, but I’m sure it’ll come back come spring when half the town population returns.\n\nLots going on this town of 200 full time residents, 500 part time 😩",

Man takes out restraining order against woman (I believe it was because she drove the car through the house and narrowly missed him and one of the kids… but that could be off). About a week after filing the restraining order, he shows up at the house to pick up some stuff and/or the kids, and she meets him outside and proceeds to shoot him in the gut with a shotgun, in front of the kids. He dies. She was arrested, made bail, and then nothing. It’s been about 3 years, and there has not been a single mention of the incident or a trial or so much as a hearing since.

We were the 'raiders' allegedly. The school colors were maroon and white (similar to redskins. Maroon is just a darker shade of red). Obviously most saw the issue here. Eventually basically overnight it was changed as soon as people put 2 and 2 together. But the funny thing is, the official statement from the school was that \"this mascot is obviously racist and bad, and since the start of the school in 1938 we have never adopted an official mascot\". The amusing part about this is the school has been selling merchandise of this mascot for the last 30-40 years, it was painted on our football field, the scoreboard, and even on the website. Conveniently enough a wind storm took out the scoreboard and they had the field re done around the same time to get rid of these logos. I think the funniest part was the denial of it ever existing when everyone basically already had a sweatshirt with this logo on it, I mean EVERYONE (the school was a big part of the town, football games were a huge deal, hell we even have people wear red face paint, I mean the cheerleaders even. Keep in mind this is considered a very progressive town that believes In cancel culture but nobody ever stopped to compare it to blackface when it's arguably worse). \n\nI think there was only a large \"holy shit they were serious moment\" when they started taking the red Indian badges off our school laptops. They would collect the laptop throughout the day, wouldn't tell you why, and when you got it back the badge was gone. Some people who weren't in school managed to keep them.",

I can't help but think this dude has a personal vendetta against punctuation as strong as his hatred for this judge, his ex, her boyfriend, her brother and the mother of either his ex or her boyfriend.

Jack replied that his grandfather had been the one to sign the petitions because his grandfather is an assessor and that made the petitions official. Dude A again said that all notarized meant was that they were signed. Jack replied: \n\n\n**Randomn Dude A**,*Petitions need to be notarized so I can have it put on the ballot so people can vote on it The county won’t put it on the ballot if The documents aren’t notarized So get out there and vote and not everybody can notarize a document.*\n\n\nSeveral commenters replied that he was crazy and also basically stupid for posting all of legal drama on social media and naming names. The following are all of his comments in the first thread, laying out his case. \n\n[In response to being told he sounded like a crazy person and that no one knew what he was talking about]: *It’s been all over Facebook on 10 different pages when I go door-to-door I’ll explain it to you to much to type but you can look at previous posts on other groups*\n\n[In response to a WTF gif]: *Why don’t you ask Jane Smith why she brainwashes and fucking up our kids life  and why Dan Jones beat her eight times* 🤷‍♂️\n\n*I’ve been dealing with this for 11-year judge Banks has been on the case since then enough time has gone by where this is the only option make it public and get a petition which I did ,get it notarized which I did and now we’re going to get people to sign it so I can get it put on the ballot to have him removed*\n\n[In response to the question 'Aren’t all court decisions public?]  *I believe they are when I get home today I’ll put the case number up on Facebook you guys can go dig into it and try to make sense of all of this I sure as hell can’t*\n\n*Hell I’ll post 20 something letters over the past three years and Have been sent to that court with motions we’re nothings been done about it besides her getting a slap on the wrist and told not to do it just so she can get out of court and continue to do it again*\n\n*It’s exhausting so pretty much done with the court and I’m just gonna take this Avenue with getting petition signed putting up political signs going to that courthouse is just a waste of time Hell I can’t even have these people get back to me in a reasonable time with a court date it all just a joke and they messed my kid up pretty bad*\n\n[In response to being asked \"If you think gou can do a better job, why don't you run to be a judge?\" ...^I ^swear ^these ^people ^have ^no ^clear ^understanding ^of ^how ^the ^system ^works] \n\n*Ask yourself this. Full-time job for 11 years provided health insurance for 11 years precinct captain Patty Pennyfeather allowed her to move back in with the woman beater with a laundry list of police reports and a lengthy criminal record 90 days later we’re in a court room and my visitations are being thrown up in the air Because he had some criminal on the bench giving testimony*\n\n*Any other judge would have separated the woman beater criminal until further notice two years later this is where we’re at*\n\n*The judges is unfit would you have your children around some guy who beats women eight times with a laundry list of police reports She’s also sent me pictures of her and her boyfriend of my kid Banks done nothing videos of her lying and her drama Banks does nothing*\n\n*I don’t wanna be a judge but I’m gonna tell you this any judge who makes crap decisions like this should be removed and if you think that his decisions are good I don’t know what to tell you*\n\n*So ask yourself that question would you allow your child around some guy who beat women eight times and there’s a laundry list the police reports if the answer is no sign my petition*\n\n[In response to someone saying *Judge has him around the kids, and not you? Sounds like a good opportunity for a little self-reflection. 😎*] \n\n*So I should just go and beat some women and break the law right I should have my dad pay me cash at Doug’s auto body so I can put my son on full-blown welfare and rip the state off then will I be allowed around my kid*🤦\n\n*sounds kind of crazy right sounds like the judge should probably be removed*🤷‍♂️\n\n[When the same person then said \"Judge Banks is an honorable man. The one who sounds crazy here is you. Sorry you're in this situation. I hope things get better for you.\"]\n\n*You still haven’t answered my question. do you have kids would you allow them in a situation like that I put the pictures of the house up a while ago*\n\n*If you have a daughter I would really reconsider calling this judge honorable* to which the guy replied \"# 1: It's the judges place to decide these matters. # 2: I don't owe you any answers. A judge's job is to interpret the law. I have a daughter and three sons. And none of them have been inside a courtroom.* \n\nJack Brown: *and that’s the whole point of the petition to call him out on his decisions and get him removed nobody’s going to think this is ok* \n\n[the guy replied to say]: It's a good thing I'm not a judge. I'd order for you to be euthanized.\n\n[They continued going back and forth, with Jack saying]: *So see this shit is common sense it’s not even a difficult decision. Well I signed the paper for the court weeks ago to get a court date but they’ve kind of giving me the runaround probably because they’re embarrassed about these decisions they’ve made. Where does it State in the law she’s allowed to violate a court order tons of times and not have anything happen How come Judges down here (he is currently in Illinois) think this is crazy* \n\nThe rest of his comments, replies to other comments and a later post:\n\n[Someone said the judge was great] *By Great you mean putting a woman beater around children who beat a woman eight times right and the guy faked three suicides on  record with the court right. David Renon The guys a joke go check out the pictures I posted of the house a couple months ago that’s your great judge*🤦\n\n*Would you allow your children in that situation Then explain to me how he’s a great judge*\n\n*For two years I sat here and called things out he did jack shit now my daughters life is turned completely upside down because her mother is mentally insane*\n\n*I’m gonna post a police report probably later tomorrow my daughter had to barricade herself in her room the last time he Beat up Mom and Patty Pennyfeather allowed her to go move back in fucking wild*\n\n*well he had a criminal woman beater on the bench in my trial that was Mom‘s witness fucking joke*\n\n*Also Patty Pennyfeather had two private conversation with her  in court ethics violation after ethics violation It’s just nonstop pretty sure they know her stepdad but But I really don’t care who they know my rights don’t stop when they know somebody so hopefully the petition gets enough signatures and hopefully people get out there and vote*\n\n*I have I had to do wellness checks on my daughter side go weeks without speaking to her on the phone brought that up to Banks and Patty Pennyfeather they both did nothing*\n\n*That’s why I’m going this route with the petitions*\n\n*I’m also going to be posting some pictures of me and my daughter the funny thing is the woman beater who is a criminal and mom who obviously has a motive tried to say that there was trauma at my house Which is a joke well you look at those pictures and videos and you tell me if you say any trauma*\n\n*Also years back when I did you three supervise visits Jane, the mom was inciting things and the supervisor had to cut her down and say none of that happened Jane likes to incite things and coach my daughter up asking her the same question over and over again until she gets the answer she wants judge Banks done nothing about this*\n\n*The judge just knows her or knows  her stepdad and that’s why she’s getting away with all this but now it’s on Facebook and at least people where I’m from think this guys a joke lol*\n\n(Continuing in 2nd comment because for the first time ever, I hit the character limit)",

Keeping in mind this involves drastically modifying how kids are getting to and from school, fucking up their schedules.\n\nSo every student in this town for the next 3 years is gonna be fucked. The principals and parents and community all voted and spoke against this insane plan. But gov wants to sell the land the other 3 schools were on, because the only liberal thing about our gov is their greed.\n\nSo instead of having 4 different schools covering different districts and competing with each other, we will have one school with a monopoly on education for 50km in every direction. Not mention the logistical nightmare of have 6000+ kids getting to and from this place at 9am and 3pm everyday on the main road to enter the town.\n\nBut that's not even the worst part. They are laying off tones of teachers. Bigger school, less teachers, hows that work?",

            "text": "I grew up in a small town of about 1,500 people. I left there about 16 years ago, so it's not a CURRENT local controversy, but it is definitely one of the most defining stories of my small town...despite happening about 25 years ago, there are still reminders of this event at the  local hockey arena AND high school. \n\nSo, in any small town, there are always a few families that are the \"untouchable\" ones. They run local businesses, one member or another of their family is usually the mayor, they are your typical pillars of the community. In our town, there were three of them (the Smiths, Joneses, and Wilsons - not their real names, but going to keep the names generic). \n\nKeeping the whole family background out of it, suffice it to say that these families were all very tight with one another. Going back three generations, they had been friends, farmed right next to one another, went to church together, got together on weekends to watch football. They all had kids around the same age and those kids went to school together, played football and hockey together, and were best friends, just like daddy and granddaddy before them. \n\nThen, the event.\n\nYou see, around the time this happened, our town was smack dab in the middle of a massive oil boom. Every male in our community over the age of 18 worked in the oilfield in some capacity...and I mean Every. Single. One. And that included the young men of the Smith, Jones, and Wilson families. These particular young men worked for an oilfield service company and their job was to drive around to an assigned set of wells on a daily basis, make sure they were all operating properly; and, if they weren't, fix them. They all had their wells they went to check and that was that. Well one day, Smith is out checking a well; and, seeing an opportunity for both him and Jones to get home to their wives and kids earlier that day, he calls up Jones and proposes that they switch the last well of the day. Smith was closer to Jones' well, and Jones was closer to Smith's.\n\nMakes sense, right? Why would they not do this. Jones wholeheartedly agrees to switch wells and thanks Smith for letting him know this brilliant idea to shave 20 minutes off each of their work days. \n\nSo off they went, Smith went to the well that had been assigned to Jones, saw that nothing was wrong, and went on his merry way home. Jones, arriving at the well that had originally been assigned to Smith, opened the door and was instantly engulfed by a cloud of H2S. For those not aware, H2S (or hydrogen sulfide) is a common gas created at oil wells. In a high enough concentration, it will kill a person almost immediately. This was a small room with a door that had been sealed since the well was last checked. Young Jones had no chance. He died almost immediately. \n\nWhen the story leaked to the town, it was quickly discovered that the well change had been originally suggested by Smith. In the eyes of Jones' parents, Smith was responsible for the untimely death of their son, and they were not about to let it go. The entire town quickly divided between Camp Smith and Fort Jones. The more reasonable people understood it was a freak accident and it could have happened to anybody. The more unreasonable wanted Smith investigated and potentially charged with murder. \n\nConsistent badgering instigated by the Jones' eventually caused Smith to have a mental breakdown. Keeping in mind here that not only was he being accused as a murderer publicly while trying to go about his normal day, but the person he was being accused of murdering just so happened to be his best friend of nearly 30 years, who could blame him. He attempted suicide and was eventually sent to a psychiatric facility for the better part of two years. After leaving the psychiatric facility, he ventured back to our town and was met in much the same way as he had been before. Public sneers and accusations. He attempted suicide again and barely made it through. After that, he turned to alcohol and eventually got so bad that his wife (a local school teacher) left town and took their kids. Still, the more hardcore people in town blamed Smith. \n\nUntil the second instalment of the event.\n\nIn the second act, a new player was drug into the story. I'm unsure how, but this was never discovered until years afterwards. You see, in addition to Smith and Jones, the Wilson family also had a young son who worked for that same company doing the same job. Several years after the event, and thankfully after the Wilson son had left town (in his own walk of shame...completely unrelated, but still shameful), it was revealed that the last time that well had been checked before Jones died out there, it had been checked by Wilson. It was revealed, for some reason, that Wilson had left a valve open during his check at that well, which had allowed the H2S to escape, fill the room, and eventually kill Jones. \n\nWilson's parents still lived in town and were essentially forced out. His father owned an electrical contractor company and was bought out by his partner and told he wanted nothing to do with him. His mother was the local hairdresser and all of her clients left her in very short order. They left town under the auspices of \"retiring to the city\" and never came back. \n\nAnd that's the story of my hometown. The Wilsons are all gone now. The Jones are still in town and are still considered the pillar of the community. The vast majority of the Smiths have left. I think there may be a cousin of the Smith in question still in town, but that's about it. \n\nTo this day, some 25 years later, a small shrine still sits in the local hockey arena displaying the hockey jersey and some beloved hockey photos of the deceased Jones boy. In the high school, another shrine with the high school yearbook from 199x (whatever year the Jones boy graduated) permanently opened to the page with his profile on it. On the other side of the fold, somewhat ironically, is the profile of the Smith boy. Two smiling, happy young men forever remember by one tragic event...all because they wanted to get home 20 minutes early.",

If you go about a mile down the smaller road, it turns into a dirt road and one ranching family owns the land on either side of that for about 100 yards.  They do not own the road, but the road is really narrow.  So, naturally, people drag race up and down that 100 yard strip every night.  The family who owns the land is fine with it, their son is sort of the major coordinator of it, but everyone else is enraged about the whole thing.  The cars are loud and keep people up at night, but also the cattle on neighboring ranches get distressed and make noise all night.  In addition to that, lots of drug/alcohol use at the races.  According to everyone, the sheriff doesn't care because he's friendly with the family.  \n\nI live right before the road turns into a dirt road in a small subdivision, and the town police seem to have posted up right at the entrance/exit to the races and pull people over at the end each night.  Personally, if it was just racing/being loud I don't care all that much.  I've helped out on the surrounding ranches during summer and there seems to genuinely just be one cow that gets distressed...sucks for that cow but it's really the same cow every single time.  But, given what may happen when all those drunk/high folks leave it seems like a good idea to try to put a stop to it all.  Regardless, my job sometimes requires me to attend city council meetings and give updates and if I don't get on the agenda before all this is put on the agenda I end up there until about 10pm.",

They even did a groundbreaking ceremony for it's installation and had a sign \"future site of the giant lava lamp\".  The problem is, it arrived in so many pieces and broken and no one knows how to put it together (nor do they have the million dollar funding to do so).  So it currently has sat in storage for like 18+ years now.  Somewhere around 2007 a farmer in town carved a giant lava lamp crop circle into his field which is the closest the town has actually gotten to having a lava lamp display.    But the dream still lived on so then the mayor endorsed an architect who designed a silo looking lava lamp that would use laser lights to simulate the lava.  10 years later this has also not been built.  People still bring up the lava lamp and I believe the town has a sign still for it, but there is like 0% chance this thing is ever getting built regardless of the city's wishful thinking.",

Someone's dog got a taste for chicken blood. One family has a small flock of fancy chickens. Said dog, managed on three separate occasions to 'run off' during his walk and slaughter a few of this flock. As one might imagine this caused huge upset and distress for the chicken owner, and for that matter the dog owner. On each occasion, the dog owner replaced the chickens like for like. It didnt help that there was already tension between the two parties concerning other matters. Anyway, the dog owner finally managed to resolve the situation by never letting her dog off the lead on a walk after that so ruffled feathers were smoothed so to speak. Then.... another person in the village started training a Harris hawk. Yes you have guessed it, it flew off during training and took one of the fancy chickens.",

Seeing drugs busts in the newspaper is *nothing* but when when it comes to the local food truck, oh lord. Summer is when all the drama kicks in with - churches fighting to have the BEST VBS program and attract as many kids as possible - food trucks fighting (physically and verbally) over territory and menus (there’s 3 different BBQ trucks owned by people in the town who have a group chat dedicated to making sure their menus don’t match and that they weed out ALL competition.) - This one lonely dude in the middle of NO WHERE will constantly call 911 and demand the fire station sends everyone to him ASAP only for him to yell at everyone who shows up saying that if he has to pay for it on his taxes, he will be seeing them every summer evening (and this caused an increase in taxes because of the gas they have to use to get there - it has people furious at him) - we have a lady now locally know for attempting insurance fraud (I was one of her attempts) - and we have 2 black trucks causing mayhem in different ways, one will hit and run constantly and run you off the road, the other removed his muffler, gets drunk with his friends and goes mailboxing 3 times a week (and we saw them in the act while waiting on police with the lady who was trying to get insurance money out of me!!)\n\nALSO: on a smaller scale, somehow I ended up being the town drama! I work at a local grocery and I only work there because my fiancé (BF at the time) dragged me in to work there (we dated before I had the job) everyone had a theory that we were dating because we were coworkers (which was obvious - we were) and that we were bound to get married and be the next [STORE NAME] Family (store name starts with an F so everyone made a clever name.) but he had a better job opportunity and had to quit, I still work there because I have my favorite customers that I simply cannot say goodbye to; so now lots of people (mainly old people) constantly ask where he went, if I’m going to run away with him, if the ring on my finger (it could be a glow in the he dark Dino ring and they’d still ask) means that I’m getting married. Then I said once “I’m nauseous I’m going to the restroom” and for weeks I was being interrogated for being pregnant. Idk why old people are so obsessed with making coworkers be in romantic relationships, so when they saw there was one, oh my god it just got worse.

Neighbors are all divided between me being an evil person for setting traps on my own 60 acres, and my neighbor being an asshole for letting their dog run loose.  It's to the point that one neighbor, that also has lost chickens to coyotes, is now blaming the neighbor's dog and threatening to shoot it, while another neighbor has been caught tresspassing on my property trying to find and remove my traps.\n\nFamily: My son's girlfriend spent a few days with us over Christmas.  She met my mother.  We haven't stopped apologies to the poor girl since.  On the positive, she hasn't dumped him and run to the hills.",

He’s traditionally kept to himself and minded his own business so no one really knew if the accusations carried any truth.\n\nAnyway so the firemen who put out the blaze are all comprised of volunteers from the same town and they swear remains of the pub had nothing valuable inside whatsoever. Far more than he would have reasonably been able to remove by himself while evacuating i.e. a walk in commercial freezer, any and all bottles of liquor, furniture, serving glasses, beer taps, the gas stove. You name it, it was gone. No one knows where.\n\nThe dude appears to have taken out insurance 2 months beforehand and is still fighting the insurance company.

This has lead to people just replacing the birthday message with either nothing (just washing it off) or the lost dog message again.

Also to stop people from shooting their old dogs right next to the road.  It has recently come up that this technically means you can’t set mouse traps or kill indoor or outdoor pests unless you are licensed pest control.  The city council has been arguing for over a month now on whether it is worth rewriting or removing the law (overhunting is still a massive problem and the law has helped some), or to just not enforce it for pests.  At this point, they could’ve just rewritten it and tackled more pressing issues, but instead they’ve brought it up and argued inconclusively about it every meeting since early December.\n\nIn my neighborhood;  A lady moved into a nearby house with a large property a few years ago and converted it into a party spot.  That already was plenty of drama due to drunk people driving away at night and almost hitting kids, considering her main driveway is on a residential street.  She achieved a commercial address by making a deal with a trailer park and clearing enough land to another road, barely wide enough to be a “driveway”, so she hasn’t technically broken a law.  Back to the present, a known drug dealer has moved into a nearby house on the street.  Party Lady is a recovering drug addict and *immediately* began “dating” him.  Her party business has been dying, so she used his money to support it.  Drug Dealer was the heir to half of a scrapping business, which he sold to his brother, so he has plenty of money.  He also has a kid and his baby momma regularly visits.  Party Lady’s daughter also moved in to her house after dropping out of college.  It turns out that Drug Dealer has been sleeping with Party Lady, Party Lady’s daughter, and Baby Momma.  Party Lady walked in on Drug Dealer in bed with Baby Momma and stormed out.  That night she and her daughter got drunk and both went to Drug Dealer’s house to yell at him.  Party Lady then sold all the furniture inside her home to support her business, and presumably buy drugs.  She has since started dating Drug Dealer again, and the drama continues.

            "text": "The controversy is birds. Pigeons, to be exact. \n\nThere used to be a really shitty bar in the middle of town. The bar was in a row of older buildings that were all connected. The bar and it's owner kept causing issues with the other shops/the resturaunt it shared walls with and was frequently in trouble with the town for various violations including serving minors. \n\nWell the bar was finally shut down and no one was very upset about it. The bar owner, however, left a terrible parting gift. The back door to the bar was a shitty looking but very sturdy wooden door with a frame on top that was supposed to have glass for a window. Someone busted the window out and the owner refused to replace it. When the bar shut down, he didn't board the window, but installed cameras on the door and locked it up tight. He then fucked off and left no contact information. \n\nWell, we have a lot of pigeons. And seeing an opportunity, the pigeons flew into the window and got into the bar. But they couldn't get back out because the window was in a stairwell that lead up into the bar itself. Unless the pigeons flew down the stairs and back out the window, they were now trapped. As pigeons are not the most intelligent bird species, hundreds of pigeons flew into the window, very few came back out. \n\nThe businesses that shared walls with the old bar called the city repeatedly because pigeons were getting into the bar, getting stuck and starving to death. They wanted to save the living birds and remove the dead ones due to the smell. The town officials however said the only person that could enter was the bar owner and since he left no contact info, too bad so sad. \n\nThe fire department stated the mayor was aware and handling the situation so they could not breach the door. \n\nThe non emergency police line said they didn't handle wildlife enforcement, the fire department did. So they could not breach the door. \n\nWild life rescues were willing to house the birds, but without the owners permission to enter they could not legally go get the surviving birds. \n\nThe town building and mayor stated that since the building was still owned, they could not legally enter the building until the owner gave permission. But the owner was not contactable. And thus the circle of phone calls continued and no progress was made. \n\nFor the next several months the entire town rallied against the mayor and his officials to try and save these birds who would flock to the windows of the bar when they saw people and desperately peck at the glass for freedom. The fire department, police department, town building, local rescues and anyone else that could be called was called. And every call lead to the same answer: you cannot legally enter without the owners permission. \n\nPeople kept attempting to break into the bar to save the birds, but couldn't breach the door and it's security cameras. The police kept warning that charges would be pressed for anyone who successfully got into the bar. \n\nAfter MONTHS of this, the mayor caved and allowed a crew to go in and remove the birds. Except by now, almost all of them were dead and decaying. There were HUNDREDS of dead pigeons rotting in the bar. They were piled against windows, laying across the floor, stuck in sinks and cabinets, etc. The smell was so strong you could be on the sidewalk and get sucker punched by the stench of rot and death. There were so many flies they blacked out most of the street facing windows. \n\nIn the end, there were very few surviving pigeons. While they could eat the dead ones, they didn't have a water source. \n\nThe amount of dead birds, bird shit and flies were deemed a serious health hazard and the entire bar now has to be completely gutted. \n\nThe fire department was reprimanded for failing to intervene, since they are the ones that enforce safety and housing codes which would include wild life infesting a building. But the fire department has shot back stating that they didn't act because the mayor didn't want them to. So it's been a public shit show of finger pointing to pin the blame, and the town is furious that these birds were left to die the way they were. \n\nThe building has been vandalized repeatedly and the mayor has been designated the Pigeon Murderer.",

He will be known as LibGuy\n\nThe problem started when he decided to have chickens for his own eggs but he lived within the city proper which had a rule against farm animals within the city (this is a rural farming area I live in). One of the city council members (he shall be known as A-hole) discovered he had chickens a few weeks after he got them and the city sent him a letter telling him he had to get rid of them. Well, he was not going to go down without a fight. So he spent some time looking into things and discovered the A-hole who reported him lived within the city and he also had chickens.  \n\n\nWell, this of course caused a bit of a scandal. The city ended up claiming there was a grandfather clause for anyone who had livestock within the city prior to the rule change 17 years ago. The problem with that was that clause applied to the A-hole's father, not the A-hole who lived at the same address. Needless to say, the war was on!  \n\n\nA couple of weeks go by and the town cops are messing with Libguy over petty shit. Libguy somehow gets a recording of A-hole calling the police and lying to them about what Libguy was doing. Police now want to charge Libguy for some absurd ridiculous recording law that really doesn't apply since it was someone with the police dept who gave him the tape not that he stole it. This gets blown up to the point where the bigger cities news crews are now showing up to city council meetings that are being called to address this issue. These meetings are getting absurdly blown out of proportion and in all honesty somewhat slimy and jicky in how the city is handling it. Libguy subpoenas the city council emails to show there was a concerted effort to fuck with him and cover for A-hole.   \n\n\nWell in the course of getting the Emails it was discovered that there was a sexting issue going on between three of the city council members. LMAO, believe me when I say this did not involve people that would be considered sexy. all three (2 women and 1 male) were married, 200lbs plus, and in their 50's. I mean Emails about double-dildos, pegging, swinging...etc..It was hilarious.  \n\n\nIn the end, the Libguy got the last laugh. he lost his chickens but found a loophole where he could actually own Llamas in the city since they were not considered [livestock. So](https://livestock.So) he put up a fence all around his yard (ugly chicken wire fence) just tall enough so the Llamas could not get out by jumping. People actually would go by walking their dogs and pet the Llamas. The problem though was that Llamas shit like cows and it stinks in such a small enclosure. This went on for about a year until he sold his house and moved (it stunk for at least a block around his property and he lived right behind the town's grocery store). Two of the council members involved got divorced over the sexting issue and the third one sold her bar because of it.\n\nThis was the infamous chicken scandal that plagued my town of 4K for 3 years.",

Also, there’s already a sidewalk on the other side of the road, thus rendering this addition even more pointless.\n\nAnyways, there was supposed to be funds set aside by the local government for just this sort of occasion, but they made us pay for it out of pocket, for some unknown reason. So yeah, like $2,000 wasted on something pretty much useless. The neighbors and us could’ve taken it to court, but the lawyer basically said would’ve cost even more money and dragged it out even further for something we were pretty sure we’d win, but weren’t 100% certain.\n\nI was away for most of the legal stuff, but I think we settled out of court that they’d fix our roads (which are in not the best shape) and we’d pay for the corners.

Gee, I wonder if her mom and cousin being on the school board has anything to do with it.\n\nThis teacher has it out for our principal, who has many faults, but gave me my job so I respect her. Her mom and cousin are on the board, and her other cousin is another teacher at our school who cannot approach problem without turning it into conflict. They all dislike my boss.\n\nSo, we have these huge maple trees on our campus, but they've lost two large (3-400lb) limbs this year due to stem rot during wind storms, so the board decided to cut them down for the safety of the kids. The kids picked new species of trees to replant. And everything was good to go.\n\nThe morning the tree crews show up to cut down the trees, sabbatical teacher and her 6 year old got into one of the trees, claiming a protest to cutting down \"heritage\" trees she claims she has a personal connection to because she grew up at our school.\n\nShe refused to get out of the tree. Eventually some parents showed up to side with tree sitter teacher and raised their voices at staff. They say it isn't safe! They also shame my boss for having the tree crews work on a school day. (We live 90 minutes from the next town. Weekend trim crews are hard to come by. Oh yeah, and the board approved this.)\n\n So my boss calls the sheriff to get her ass out of the tree to resolve the safety issue. (It's a 90 minute drive for the sheriff, too.) Sheriff shows up and kooklord is out of the tree before the sheriff can exit their car. She argues with them for a bit, and they leave. Then, the angry parents collect around here like she is some kind of prophet and sit on the grass while she preaches to them. School had ended at this point and two other teachers and I were just watching these idiots. \n\nThe community harassed and harangued my boss, and the board did a pivot (gee I wonder why) and asked for the trees to be limbed instead of entirely removed. The issue of falling limbs still exists, but at least I get to look at ugly fucking maple stumps shooting 30 feet in the air with no branches. \n\nMy favorite part of this story? Said teacher lives in our \"downtown\" and had a bunch of 100 year old trees in front of her house last year for safety reasons.",

Our school district received a letter from the Mohawk Tribe of New York formally asking us to stop using their name for our school teams. This has been an ongoing debate for 30+ years if we should change it or not to be more politically correct. Well, our school board voted to change the name and all hell broke loose. Boomers, gen X, and early millennial citizens of the town are in absolute outrage-99% of them are white with probably no indigenous ancestry. ‘It’s just a name’, ‘we aren’t hurting anyone by using this name’, and my favorite ‘we chose that name to honor them’. We didn’t choose that name to honor them, it goes back to teams wanting to use the names of indigenous tribes as an intimidation tactic because white people are scared of anyone different than their European ancestors. Also, we are in Iowa, the Mohawk (aka Kanienkehaka) Tribe didn’t even live here.\n\nAnyway, those who are upset are mostly former alumni from the high school who never participated in any sports or extracurricular activities-or even left the town after graduation. Almost all those in favor actually participated in school and don’t care about changing the name because the name isn’t part of our achievements. Changing the team name doesn’t take away our varsity letters and state competition titles. Our team name doesn’t define us, our actions do.\n\nOne of the nights the school board was meeting to discuss the name change, one of the town’s head racist asshole organized a protest. They thought they would have hundreds of people show-only 40 came. Our infamous insurrection attending citizen used her friend as a prop. The friend is a POC and had told others previously that she was of Hispanic descent but held up a sign that said something like ‘I’m native and I support keeping the name’. It’s a mess and even my older liberal family members are upset about the name change because they don’t think it’s necessary. I’m glad I don’t live there anymore.",

We're a horribly split town race wise, vast majority of minorities live in low income housing and its *rough*. Talking non-livable rough, and completely separated from the rest of town. Our city council is two white folk two black folk, and of course the vote to simply remove this painting was split 2-2 in the way you'd expect, so it fell to our Vice-Mayor. Well, my dad (progressive but hates talking politics) is a pastor here and the Vice-Mayor happened to go to his church, so he came to my dad and they had a long conversation about his decision. Ultimately, he voted to remove the painting. This is where shit went insane. A two page ad was taken out in the paper cursing the Vice-Mayor's name, signed by nearly 500 residents including many from the church (much to my dads dismay). His kids started getting bullied *bad* in school, I believe they ended up getting pulled out for a while, and people were coming to his house tormenting his family over his decision. There was a serious attempt to have him removed and run out of town. All because he decided that the portrait of the KKK Grand Wizard who held no significance to the town hall should be moved.

There are a lot of deer running around so naturally people feed them. Some people set up feeders but most just feed by hand.\n\n50% of the people love feeding deer and the other 50% absolutely hate them for it. Since last February the police have been called to 5 fights between feeders and non-feeders. In December a car with 3 people in it drove into the neighborhood around 1400 and shot 3 deer under a feeder in someone's front yard. Two dudes jumped out and grab one of the dead deer and tossed it into the trunk and drove off. Now there is a conspiracy that the deer drive by was done in retaliation to a non-feeder getting arrested for assault after one of the fights because the deer they killed where apparently well liked by the feeder that pressed charges. No arrests in the drive by but the sheriff says they have a suspect. About 6 people saw it but no one got the license plate number or description of the guys, just description of the car.\n\nYesterday the neighborhood watch Facebook group split in two. So now in theory there are two neighborhood watch groups, one pro feeding the deer and one anti feeding the deer. We have a block party every April around Easter and they are already talking about canceling it or setting up competing block parties.\n\nThat's the way it stands right now. It is looking like it will get more ridiculous before it gets any less ridiculous. \n\nI am friends with the guy that owns the ranch, he lets me shoot deer on it, and my back yard backs up to the ranch with a an alley between so...I am just waiting for the day one of the feeders sees me drag a dead deer off the ranch across the alley into my yard lol.",

There were loads of objections based on it being out of character for our little, very old town (we have several medieval buildings still in use, and most of the high street is older than 1900), and the reduction of car parking availability, which was already a problem for the town. In the end, though, the project was cancelled because the land is owned by the adjacent supermarket and leased to the council for car parking, and there's a covenant in place that means no for-profit structure can be built there, so that puts shops out of the question.\n\nWell now it's been developed again. Half the car park has been redeveloped with long overdue new tarmac, and automatic barriers have been installed. The other half is blocked off, waiting for construction of an old people's home (because our town apparently doesn't have enough of these already).\n\nBut the developer got started before they got planning permission, so even though the supermarket covenant doesn't apply because it'd be a social care setting rather than shops, they still can't do anything because the council hasn't approved it. So they're left with half a car park that's not useable because the layout has been interrupted for the contruction of the new layout of the other half of the car park. They'd have to redo that half to make it usable as a car park again, but there's no point in that if they get planning permission soon, so they're losing out on the income from some 80+ car parking spaces. If it weren't for Covid, the town would be up in arms about the lack of car parking, but there's been a marked reduction in demand so it's not.",

Some people will claim to have heard it, others will deny it, there will be speculation as to what it may have been (gas vent, propane tank bursting, accident, fireworks, farmer shooting coyotes or other predators). \n\nEven better is who cares? It doesn’t matter what it was. It’s not really an area where people care about farmers shooting predators, it’s not like it’s a driveby shooting. I had to shoot a Racoon in my driveway because it was rabid and tried to attack my dog one year. My neighbor had to scare off a bear in a similar manner. It’s not “did someone get shot?” “ Or why are your shooting a firearm?” It’s more a question of what animal was it and was it dangerous/how dangerous… and people know it’s a gun shot. Except if it’s 3AM. Then it’s a mysterious phantom boom or bang.\n\nIt’s very rare the cause is anything to even be concerned about. The most significant I remember is a propane tank burst in a garage. So there might be something like 30-40 mysterious booms and bangs a year and in the last maybe 10 years it’s been something of concern maybe twice. \n\nThat said it won’t stop. I fully expect to see the posts of the next mysterious boom and bang in the next week or two. Sometimes I make sarcastic troll posts if there hasn’t been one in a while like “thank god I was getting worried they had stopped”.",

On top of all that, he showed up to meetings and professional trainings in old jeans, a variety of Hawaiian shirts, and always unshaven when the dress code was known to be Business Professional.\n\nHis seat is up for election this year.\n\nHe gave a very angry and entirely unapologetic interview to the local paper, which was run as part of the article about his censure.

            "text": "Our town isn’t small compared to most folks on here, but there are less than 10,000 of us. Its found a bit north of a large and long highway that runs 300 miles through Virginia, part of U.S. Route 60. Most who live here make their living working with their hands, farmers, mechanics, and the occasional businessman who trades the trek into Richmond for the cheap housing. \n\n\nCurrently there is a very prosperous logger who owns a good portion of undeveloped land throughout the county. For a bit of scale on the size, my house sat next to a portion of the logging land. Some miles down the road was a road that divided this portion from the rest, about 80 to 100 acres in total between our house and that road. On the other side of that tiny road was another 800 acre stretch of land that he was planning on logging as well. So all in all he had at about 900 acres ready to be logged, quite possibly more as if stretched back into a part of the county unreachable by road, and I’m not keen on trespassing where everyone and there mother has a gun.(The logging occurred when I was still in middle school so I don’t have exact measurements, take this with a grain of salt). \n\nHe logged that land for a good while, up until I was a junior in highschool. I was a bit sad when it started, being a kid and all. If you drove by it on just the right night, the moon would peak out just above and light up the edge. You’d be greeted with this eerily beautiful view of nature.. I felt something deep for those small woods, but it’s just trees and they’ll be back one day when I’m long gone. Funnily enough, accidents went down once they logged it, so I guess I wasn’t the only one who’d been staring.\n\nNo one in town really minded the logging. It was his property and he wasn’t bothering no one. What they were weary of was what would come after. A lot of people were scared of new housing, an influx of outsiders, turning the quiet country into a loud suburb. I never minded that idea though. All those new people, maybe some company would finally see reason to bring in broadband to the area. And so people waited to see what would happen. And waited. And waited until it all just fell into the back of their minds.\n\nWell imagine the shock when everyone in town gets the same thing in the mail that day. A crisp white letter with bold red ink stamped by the local government. I remember seeing and think it looked important as my dad went through the mail. A few minutes later I heard a loud “What in the Sam Fuck” from the kitchen. What was in the letter was a plan that called for the creation of a solar farm by a brand new LLC, and an invitation to a public hearings that were to occur  a few weeks before the project began.\n\nNow for context on why people got a bit angry. In 2019 the county came up with a long term plan for what the town would look like in two to three decades. It included a list of objectives and what people should generally expect to happen. Nowhere on there was there talk of the creation of a solar plant right next to peoples houses. And this was no regular solar plant either. Remember how there were over 900 acres of logged land. Well 927 acres were to be used for the solar plant, and this was already next to a 160 acre solar farm.For reference, it’s recommended that plants never exceed 500 acres. \n\nThe logger and the LLC were also engaged in some very questionable behavior regarding zoning. They knew that trying to rezone the property would most likely get rejected, because of the size of the property. So they instead applied for a Conditional-Use-Permit, which would let them use the land however they see fit even if it did not comply with the current zoning ordinance.\n\nA small part of it would also be built on a few acres of state park grounds, disrupting wildlife and migration patterns. During one of the hearings, a ecologist came forward with findings on how that this would really fuck with the park and the animal population.\n\nMost people who were upset weren’t upset because it was a solar plant, but because it was a massive project that the company was trying to slip through the bureaucracy fast enough that no one would’ve known what was happening until it was too late. The board of supervisors were also bought along with the promise that this farm would make the county a lot of money, which somewhat shows because they granted the permit 5-0. It also doesn’t look well that they never told the public until days before they happened. So to the people of town it felt like the county and the company were conspiring against them.\n\nJust so no one claims I’m some far right extremist who thinks solar farms are secretly brain washing people or whatever, I think solar farms are cool and a good way for clean energy.",

I can't recall the exact reason, but that's essentially the jist of it. \n\nPeople obviously think that's a stupid rule, and don't listen to it. You can tell that the police don't care either, as they loosely enforce it, but once in a while, the police will have to come over to the island and knock on someone's door because some resident ratted on them.

There's a lot of British people here. A few years ago there was a guy in my town called Pete. Pete liked to get drunk. And people enjoyed drunk Pete. He gained the nickname \"Party Pete\" but then there were problems. One night he'd been out at a club till 5 AM. He couldn't be bothered walking home so he went to the takeaway where he worked, unlocked it and passed out half in half out of the door. The owner's wife found him in the morning and woke him up. He called her a \"fucking bitch\" and staggered off home. Obviously, he got sacked. But he still wanted to live the \"Party Pete\" lifestyle, so he started selling drugs. His friend who still worked in the takeaway was selling them in there for him. \n\nOne Christmas Day, I was round at a friend's having dinner. At about 11:30 PM Party Pete showed up, unannounced, spilt red wine down a girl's nice dress, knocked photos off the walls and got thrown out. His last post on Facebook at about 11:45 was \"fuck yall\"\n\nIt turned out that he decided to drive home that night. He crashed into an old woman's car that was parked in her driveway. She came out and he begged her not to go to the police. He tried to offer her 2000 euros. She told him \"well, no, you've destroyed my car!\" so she got the police. They asked him for ID and he didn't have any. So they took him to his home and told him they'd wait outside while he went to get his ID. He walked inside and promptly fell asleep. So the police waited, then came in and found the huge amounts of drugs that he'd just left lying around the place. A fruitbowl full of weed, apparently. Pills and coke scattered around. So they arrested him, of course. \n\nHe then gave up ALL the local drug dealers - including the guy he lived with, who he would have to continue living with after that. He also gave up the guys in the valley who were the big suppliers. He had to go into hiding as they kept coming up looking for him. He tried to carry on living here but it was just impossible. He was unemployable, he had pissed off a lot of people so he couldn't go out....in the end his parents came and got him and took him home. He has no social media presence now and I do sometimes wonder what he's up to these days.",

Owns tons of farmland and the largest construction company in the area. The entire family is corrupt and has used that money to, for example, make their oldest son's hit & run DUI charge vanish years ago. The family he almost killed, who weren't well-off, suddenly had *two* new vehicles, then sold their house to good ol' boy and moved away. Rumor was they were offered more money than they could refuse, and good ol' boy laundered the bribe though the house sale. They tore the house down and used every square foot of the lot to build a gigantic metal barn right in the middle of the neighborhood to store equipment in.\n\nThe factory also had a reputation. Most of the employees were people who did hard time, hard drugs, drifters who would come and go. A lot of drugs went through that place and most assume the sons had a hand in it. The sons also acquired half the business spaces around the town square several years ago, ran a campaign to \"Restore the Square!\", people donated, the sons got funding from the gov, and it's been a dormant state of construction/renovation for over 5 years. Half the buildings are empty, half are small businesses with zero parking because of the stacks of scaffolding and the ridiculously large fork lift they keep parked there that looks like it belongs in some sort of large scale mining operation. Sometimes they'll come in with a semi, block the entire street while they load it up to use for their construction business, then bring it back when they're done. \n\nAnyway, the factory fell in and the state sent some people to inspect it. It was recently leaked that what started as an inspection has turned into a federal investigation into the family that has been going on for almost a year. \n\nA local worked her wiles and is marrying one of the investigators.

So over a MILLION DOLLARS worth of fiber cable is underground not doing anything. Just sitting there. The icing on the cake?

The current controversy is one I’m involved in: I contacted a company from about 20 miles away to come clear an access road onto my 25-acre property. I’d initially planned to have a local man do it, but he’s delayed over 6 months and I need to have the trees felled before the leaves come back. Apparently I’m a big city out-of-towner who thinks I’m too good for a the local guy. My wife is from the area, so she hears everything through family members. What sucks is that all other business decisions usually have to go through someone or some business in town, and now that I’ve used a non-town company to cut my access road, I’m going to find it difficult to get much done. Rookie mistake! The fix for now is to have my wife do all the things that need to be done, while publicly disagreeing with my decision. She has to tell people “I told him NOT to have that big company do it and just wait until Todd is available!” Privately she wants her house built, so she supports it lol.",

The controversy is the story about how the fire started. It is said that the cafe has timers on all their coffee machines that turn on at 4:00am and one of these timers short circuited and started the fire. This would kind of make sense if it weren't for the fact that the baker would have arrived at the same time the timer started, and the baker said that the place was already alight.

Town board is run by a couple of families in the republican bloc who believe in minimal government to the extreme and continually cut services under the guise of saving money, but also contract certain improvement projects out to family businesses who are also in the bloc.  They now have millions in the bank and no plans to spend any of it. The town could have a nice pool and rec center or any number of other things to make life better, but no, that costs money and why would we want to waste the free money we're getting from the landfill to better our neighborhood?",

Now jay grew up around in a small little town where everyone knew everyone in the middle of Minnesota, but he and my aunt (let’s call her Amy) were high school sweethearts and they’ve been together for 20+ years. But after they got out of school they moved down to New Mexico and i really wasn’t close to them because they lived so far but jay hung out with the wrong crowd and he was doing meth and heavily drinking. After he had his first two kids he quit doing meth and got his life back on track, after 15 years of living in New Mexico they moved back to Minnesota and jay found out his best friend (let’s call him chad) was in the area and they reconnected and he introduced chad to his family and friends. But recently jay and Amy have been going through a rough patch and he has been sleeping at a friends house. After a while it seems like they are starting to get along till one day jay is riding with chad and he asked chad to use his phone and found Amy’s number in his contact list, he went to the messages between chad and Amy and saw pictures, messages, and all the times they met up before he introduced them. Chad looked at him muttered something and just smoked jay in the lip, so jay pulled him out of the drivers seat and starts to beat the hell out of his best friend (now jay is one of those people who you’ll get along with just fine but if you get on his bad said you’re screwed big time). They ended up in the ditch and couldn’t get out Bc it’s the middle of winter and they snow was up to the windshield. Now they were stuck in the van for and hour and a half chad ended up with a broken nose and a black eye while jay had a few cuts one his face and a fat lip.\n( this all happened last night so if anything happens I’ll inform you wonderful people of Reddit)",

So my parents built a house on the land, surrounded by farmland, nearest neighbor is at least a hundred yards away.\n\nEventually, the owner of the farm passed away, and the daughter and son-in-law inherited the farm and moved in.

He didn't get permits for this, so he did all the construction/terraforming at night.  By the way, Maryland has no natural lakes or ponds.\n\nOne night, one side of the pond he constructed gave way, and the water rushed out and flooded his field.  He still rebuilt the pond, though.\n\nSome time later, he and the wife divorced, and I saw her at my job (I worked at a local pharmacy as a teenager) and she went on and on about how he got the farm in the divorce even though it had been her parents' farm.\n\nAt some point, he stopped by my parents' house to ask their opinion about how he was considering applying to the state to make the farm protected grasslands, something like that.  Apparently, he gets money from the state for this.  The land can apparently still be farmed, but it can not be plowed.\n\nAs the conversation progresses, he tells my mom how he's been getting calls from Pakistan from people with British and Pakistani accents, telling him that he needs to convince President Bush to end the war in Iraq (this was pre-2008).  If he doesn't answer the phone, they sometimes leave a message, so the Secret Service is coming to pick up his answering machine tape...\n\nSome time later, he got into some dire financial straits.  Someone came to repossess his truck, so out of spite, he drove the truck into his pond.  He was to be evicted from the property, so he busted all the windows and doors out of the house.

I don't know too many people that can say to their boss \"I don't respect you\" and keep their job, but I digress.\n\nHe ultimately was ousted from the position and people are *pissed.* It's all rantings from people who claim she's doing this because \"she's a liberal,\" \"she's power-hungry,\" and \"she was upset that he told her what he thought about her and didn't care about his performance,\" completely ignoring the fact that he wasn't doing his job in notifying her about incidences that are pretty important for her to know about until concerned parents told her, as well as him telling her outright he didn't respect her. People are now calling for her head and everything really just fuckin sucks lol.\n\nI graduated from there two and a half years ago and now coach there. I was fortunate enough not to have him as my principal. The principal I had retired after we graduated and then came in this guy. The students I interact with through coaching have told me the general enthusiasm from the student body as a whole is just super low. Granted, it seems to be on an up now given he was a hard-ass and his temporary replacement is a guy well-regarded by students and faculty and really invested in the school, but given all the things that went on while he was in charge and still just firing the principal in the first place has all-in-all ruined the year for most of them. Shit really sucks there right now and I'm just hoping it improves for everyone.",

If the train is long enough it blocks all three main roads and creates traffic jams, meaning you are unable to leave the town or even really drive anywhere at all because the damn thing is usually stopped for 30+ minutes and the traffic extends past the borders of our town. I've been over an hour late to work, and one time a school bus was 2 and a half hours late to school because of the train.

(It would not have been as difficult as they made it sound; the location is 1/2 mile from main street on the south end of town.)\n\nTo achieve this they; closed off 2 traffic light intersections on the state highway, built a huge overpass on the far south end of town, complete with four roundabouts to keep traffic controlled (so much for directly accessible). Its been there for about 5 years and everyone hates it. The entire venture successfully killed 80% of the businesses on the south end of town. Without the traffic light intersections, we no longer have access to the south west side of the highway without; taking the highway to the overpass, driving through town to reach the overpass, or taking a back road into town to come in from that side. A local landmark went out of business right after they built it and in the last year was finally torn down. Now there is a huge empty lot right in the middle of the southern business area. Many try and fail to start their own businesses on that side of town.\n\nOur hospital still outsources many of the things that having new hospital was supposed to be able to cover.",

            "text": "TL;DR: City has been ignoring one of its ordinances regarding mandatory guard rails around specific types of fountains and all types of water reservoirs for almost 7 years. Took 3 accidents (one involving the death of a child) over the past 7 years to get them to put a dinky ass rail next to the fountain. \n\nFull story:\n\nMy brother works for a local news station. He's only a cinematographer/editor, yet he's been researching and uncovering a story for the past couple weeks. \n\nWe have a huge fountain in the middle of our market area that sits at the bottom of a decently sized slope, just off the highway that cuts through our town. \n\nWell while doing research, my brother found out that there was an official ordinance regarding fountains in particular that stated something along the lines of (paraphrasing here) \"any fountain and/or water system that is 1. Linked with the main piping infrastructure of the city; and 2. Sits below 30 centimeters (or inches I can't remember but this definitely sits well below 30 inches) must have a guard rail.\"\n\nWell, it's been almost 7 years since that ordinance was put into place. Only now are we getting a guard rail. Why is this a big deal?\n\nWell, 3 accidents occurred in that span of time. 2 of which involved people that got charged with a \"DUI\" and the other was a city work that was having to mow this steep lawn right next to the water. You can guess how that ended. \n\nOnly one (of the 3 we know of at least) resulted in death. Turns out, a guy I work with (I'll call him Jim) and whom my brother also used to work with has a brother himself (I'll call him Bob). Bob was driving his kid home in heavy rain one day. \n\nThe officials say bob was intoxicated, lost control, crashed into the fountain, and showed no signs of attempting to help his kid after only saving himself, resulting in the child's death.\n\nWell, Bob's family called complete bs. Supposedly, Bob is much like Jim in the sense that they won't even touch alcohol. The family says Bob hydro-planed and lost control that way. There was this huge lawsuit about it to that I'm pretty sure the family won. \n\nThe kicker? This happened in 2017. TWO YEARS since the ordinance was put in place. \n\nThe other Accidents? Last. Year.\n\nAfter finding that out, the \"DUI'S\" started sounding more like the city and officials trying to cover their asses.\n\nThis seems even more apparent since the \"guard rail\" was \"completed.\" \n\nThe guard rail they put there this past week doesn't cover the entire perimeter of the fountain; only on the side next to the highway. And it's not even on the shoulder of the highway. Instead, its on the slope as close as possible to the fountain. It's also very short and rusted to hell. There are few things this dinky ass, rusted ass rail is gonna stop and not a single one of those things are motorized vehicles. The slope itself is deep enough that anyone driving fast or that loses control could just bounce right over it while rolling down the slope. \n\nYet, the city claims this is good enough. That the rail is done.\n\nYeah, a complete shitshow.",

I've not talked to lawyers or anything but I'm about $2000 into this so far just trying to get permission to build on MY land. The kicker is I'm the last house in this township too so if I was 100' to the south none of this would be an issue. My plan Z is buy land from my neighbor (super cool farmer guy) so I have the needed 400 feet of frontage and then destroy the crops on the section of land so I can more appropriately \"preserve agriculture\".

This tiny town is run by a “full time” Mayor who works and lives out of DC literally every day that the Borough  is open, but the typical day to day is handled by the former mayor who got himself appointed to a handful of positions in the Borough, while still the mayor, and has set himself up nicely with an 80K/ year clerk position.  We also just watched as they reappointed a police officer that is one of the better ones we’ve seen (as compared to the sergeant that was essentially gifted a lieutenant promotion after not being able to pass the test himself, and the detective who’s married to a council member and that’s on camera violating the home and civil rights of a different former council member), only to see them a week later say “Nope, we didn’t appoint you” and they appointed the former mayor’s son instead (someone that has been reported as problematic by a number of girls at the high school that he attended).  This is also ignoring the entire year of failed OPMA compliance, and gaslighting about it from both the mayor and their scummy solicitor.  I would have to say, though, that my personal favorite was when a member of council moved out of town something like 8 months before her term was up.  During a Zoom meeting, mayor shared his screen, showing an email from her where she stated that she was resigning because she was leaving town.  Another email further in stated that [the overpaid clerk] was arranging for a place for her in town.  She didn’t stay, but held her council seat until October, when mayor and council force-fed us another “yes man” without a vote.  And that was after we were on them literally every month trying to get her replaced, only to be told by the solicitor *every* time “We will not discuss the personal matters of a member of council.”  It’s important to note that this particular council person was the head of the public safety committee, and the pepper spray incident that occurred here was on her watch.\n\nIf anyone cares, I recorded the council meetings for years, and posted them so other residents could see them.  I barely scratched the surface of the nonsense going on here, and the state doesn’t want to do anything about it, but these people are the worst.\n\nhttp://www.woodlynne.net",

They eventually built a little stage and had bands and food trucks. It was super fun honestly.\n\nThen the local neighborhood right next to the bar started to complain about noise. And dog shit. And parking. Basically the bar patrons grew very disrespectful toward the bar neighbors and the neighbors were not having it.\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting: the guy who ran the bar started having a meltdown about it. Social media posts about how he was getting “fisted” by the neighbors. Characterizing all the neighbors as a bunch of “Karens and chads” (his words).\n\nCome to find out!!! That nearby neighborhood? It is a historically Black community full of elderly  Black families who have lived in those homes for generations. This is the American South we are talking about, so some of these homes have been owned by these families LITERALLY SINCE SLAVERY WAS ABOLISHED. And the bar owner and crowd, you guessed it, super duper white. \n\nCome to find out it wasn’t just noise complaints - the bar owner would rile up his customers complaining about the neighbors, and the drunken bar goers would PUT DOG SHIT IN THESE PEOPLES MAILBOXES!!!!\n\nSomeone in the neighborhood had an (adult) son who is a lawyer. He is kickass, and he basically just alerted the local government about the bar owner not complying with zoning laws. The local government gave the owner a chance to rectify the situation, but he just basically threw a tantrum, posted about how everyone was out to get him, then shut down the bar. \n\nSo in the end it is a success story for the neighborhood!

            "text": "Letchworth Village.\n\nThe question is whether the local Town's golf course properties should have been sold to a private developer. Because in my opinion, we had the perfect opportunity. And we missed out on it.\n\nGoogle \"Letchworth Village\" for context. And please bear with me, as I wrote this I got more and more heated. This might get a little tl;dr.\n\nSome history: Letchworth was originally an institution for the mentally and physically disabled, up until the late 1990's. The residents were transferred to individual group homes, including my special needs uncle, one of the sweetest, gentlest human beings I have ever known. The new system turned out to be great for the residents.\n\nThis Letchworth property spans hundreds of acres between the two Towns, and has been on each Town's tax rolls for 10+ years, with no profitability. There is a private golf course, mismanaged I might add. Not on purpose, but in my opinion - private business manages stuff better. Granted, that's just an opinion. But the fact is that the course loses money each year, and several years ago the catering hall closed up shop. \n\nIn the mid to late 1990's Letchworth buildings were subsequently abandoned by New York State. The Towns of Stony Point and Haverstraw bought the property, and currently is divided pretty much down the middle between the Towns.\n\nFor the rest of this, I'll only refer to Stony Point's side of the property.\n\nThe many stone buildings on the property need asbestos remediation. The estimate is approximately $5 million for remediation, but it's probably much more, because many of the buildings are currently decrepit, dangerous and uninhabitable.\n\nOur Chamber of Commerce has worked with both Towns to look for a suitable developer FOR YEARS - an entity with a vision not just for the property, but for a plan that would integrate nicely with our area. \n\nExamples:\n\nRocking Horse Ranch. \n\nGreat Wolf Lodge. \n\nAt one point Legoland was interested, but we rejected it because the traffic would have sucked. (1.2 million more cars per year was too much)\n\nAlso: We're alongside the Hudson River, and the potential for tourism is huge. That's not even counting West Point and Bear Mountain, 20 minutes north, and a top 5 NY tourist destination.\n\nSo...FINALLY - we find someone. Self made millionaire. Lives local, with family. Business is local. Owns the largest # of cell phone franchised stores in the Northeast. Has partners that also live local, and not that race matters, but the partners were of diverse cultures, and all family-oriented persons. In my estimation, it was a perfect fit for this area.\n\nThe developer presented a detailed plan to the Town Board. His vision was to fix the buildings that ran along the main Town highways, demolish the rest, run the golf course profitably, and build a conference center for businesses to come for retreats from NYC (35 miles from us).\n\nIn addition, he and his group also presented a plan for partnership with a five star hotel to occupy/ build on a portion of the property: The Ritz Carlton.\n\nMultiple meetings over 2.5 years. Traffic studies. Concessions and accommodations for the Town's Justice Court. Outreach to community before, during and after meetings, to provide public input. \n\nI'd say about 70% of the Town, maybe more...was on board. Contract negotiated, posted and discussed amongst more Board meetings. Sale approved.\n\nAnd then...\n\nJUN 2021: A small local environmental group (that opposes everything that takes up more electricity than a Google LED light bulb) gathers petitions to recall the vote, based on their claim that \"the information, negotiations and contract\" were done in secret. Which is absolute, unmitigated, bullshit. They flat out lied. Everything was 100% transparent, legal and communicated via multiple local channels and avenues, in person, online and more.\n\nJULY 2021: A local Lawyer mounts a challenge campaign to run for Town Supervisor. The Lawyer and Environmental group team up.\n\nAUG: Our Chamber of Commerce allows both Developer and opposition group to speak at subsequent Chamber meetings, to give a fair voice to both. \n\nThe Developer's meeting is open, respectful, and provided context, as well as a plan for how to finance the plan.\n\nThe opposition group presented an alternate vision for the property, but with no plan for how to pay for it. Also, an argument between the Environmental group and the Lawyer broke out at the end of the meeting.\n\nSEP 2021: Recall vote approved for early November. Group mobilizes to convince swing voters to turn down the sale, door to door, emails and social media overwhelm the local residents. Polarization begins.\n\nNOV 2021: Voters head to the ballots, and shoot down the sale. Developer expectedly becomes disenchanted, all the work over the past 3 years was for nothing. He diplomatically exits all future negotiations.\n\nSo now, we have no idea what's going to happen to that property next. It will likely sit there, with nobody interested. For years. \n\nThankfully, the Town Supervisor got re-elected.\n\nOh, and that environmental group? We haven't heard a damn peep from them since. Why?\n\nBecause they had no plan to begin with. Except for the word \"no\".\n\nI'll remember that when I pay my property taxes over the next few years. \n\nTl;dr: A small group dismantled a legal, multi-year transparent, and beneficial effort to sell a huge Town parcel, one which would have helped to transform this region for decades to come. We're now back at square one. Thanks.",

After starting the fire, he went aggressively banging on doors looking for help. One of said doors belonged to a locally run group home. Instead of calling the RCMP, the night shift worker called her supervisor. Instead of calling the RCMP, the supervisor called another shift worker and told all 120 lbs of her that \"a guy was knocking and nigh shifter is crying, go make sure the doors are locked and relieve night shift worker\". Relief worker is dropped off by her husband and finishes the shift.

I guess the part about the knocking guy actually being a screaming knife wielding meth dick was missed somewhere in translation between the supervisor and relief staff.

The hospital on the other side of the border is significantly closer to town (about an hour). However, if you have insurance it's likely that it won't cover your visit due to that hospital being out-of-state. \n\n- Owner of hospital knows this. Him shutting down the hospital in town gives people practically no choice but to go to his second one. If getting an ambulance ride, they will automatically go to the second hospital (unless stated otherwise, but I personally learned the hard way that they will argue with you until you threaten staying and dying).\n\n- Shut down hospital was given the opportunity to be rebuilt/reopened by the hospital from over state lines (they heard about it). Our community council denied them. This caused a local protest. \n\n- Hospital over state lines was upset about being denied. They started allowing payment plans so those in our town can still get treatment even if we can't afford the full medical bill upfront.

Inside, the young child was found beaten to a pulp. Carl had lost his shit on the poor kid and beaten him within an inch of his life, his face one giant bruise covered in blood. When he had come to his senses he panicked and fled the scene, leaving the boy there alone.\n\nWell obviously there was a warrant for his arrest, and he was eventually caught by the police. The scandal is not the abuse of the child itself, but rather that the judge gave Carl a plea deal and he ended up not spending a single day in prison. The town was OUTRAGED, with the child's grandmother in particular being vocal about the obvious miscarriage of justice. There was serious talk of a lynch mob forming, but Carl was smart at laid low, leaving his job and everything. Nobody knew where to find him.\n\nBut it gets worse. After things blow over a bit, the son of a bitch has the audacity to get a job as a handyman at the apartment complex where his ex and her son live, and the damn property manager sees no problem with this. Now, from what I heard he DID end up losing his job there, but it had nothing to do with a child abuse. He was caught having sex on the job... with his new underage girlfriend. \n\nHe is STILL not in prison, and nobody can figure out why.",

            "text": "There’s a huge debate on whether or not it’s ok to harass women & men who choose to use planned parenthood for any of their services. What caused the debate was that a church group, not from the area, decided to camp out there for 40 days & nights and harass anyone who attempted to go in. Naturally this attracted counter protesters, so they hired armed off duty cops to protect them. One day when someone was trying to talk to the church group, the off duty cop peppered sprayed them and multiple of the counter protesters. Actual cops arrived on scene and the church’s “security detail” was arrested. With all this taken place, and with video proof, many people still think it’s ok to attack anyone who tries to interact with the church group or attempt to go into the planned parenthood. Luckily, the city decided on a 15 ft buffer zone, which makes it so no group, unless going into the clinic, can be within that distance of the physical place. People are pissed!!! They really want to harass people getting STD tests, birth control, and so much more!",

Turns out that several fires were started on our street over the previous few nights, and one house was nearly burned all the way down. This went on for a couple days, little fires all over our tiny rural town. \n\nWhen they finally caught the firebug, it was discovered that she lived just a few houses down from us and across the street from the house that had nearly burned down. This was her primary target, and she did it because the couple living in the house were always up her butt about things like not taking in her garbage bins fast enough, and so forth. On top of it, she hated that they had built their house where they had, as it spoiled her view. One day, she lost it and set their place on fire. They put the fire out and she came back and set it on fire again. After that, she set fires around town to make it seem like some crazy person was randomly burning things down (hoping it would keep the heat off her). She was even interviewed by the local news, and talked about how scary the whole thing was (before getting caught).\n\nThe entire thing was absolutely batshit, and she wound up in psychiatric care.",

The mayor (who has a laundry list of dumb spending examples of poor, rural town's money in \"get rich quick\" schemes) spent hundreds of thousands of dollars that this dying town doesn't have to get a giant topiary chicken that was going to have an AirBnb loft in it. Topiary guy put up 3/4 of a frame and bailed with the money. Now \"Rusty\" the rusting framework of a chicken stands as a testament to the ideocracy of the former mayor. The town isn't sure what to do with it now. It's our \"Ice Town\". You too can see \"Rusty\" by googling for \"Fitzgerald, GA giant topiary chicken\".",
