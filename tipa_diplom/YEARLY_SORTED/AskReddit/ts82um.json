Jada really controlled that whole narrative as well as how Will was allowed to feel about the \"entanglement.\" He was made a fool of. Good loyal men have been emasculated by their wives, this shows how someone's spouse can ruin them. It had nothing to do with Chris Rock and everything to do with him trying to reclaim his manhood in her presence\r  \n\r  \nThe look on Jada’s face after Chris's joke said it all in that moment. There were expectations and if Will didn't meet them, it would become his problem. Will didn't want another televised of him looking like the \"pussy husband\" but he still laughed at the joke! If it was truly offensive, he wouldn’t, simple as that.  One look at his wife's face and he knew Jada didn't like it and had to react to safe face. Not justifying Will's actions, this is what happens when someone is publicly cucked out.\r  \n\r  \nJada told the world that she cheated on him to find herself, that he couldn't please her sexually, told the world that he was a shit father, and made it her life's work to run the \"fuck Will\" show, and that's just what's public. Imagine if Will had started fucking one of his daughters’ friends...... \r  \n\r  \nThe joke by Chris Rock lobbed was really soft.

Good for scalpers too. Sir, how much you pay for your ticket (some high number). Damn, I gotta put up my prices. Supply and demand. There's only one touring comedian who's been asulted by Will Smith on stage at the Oscar's and everybody wants a pice of him. I love capitalism. (Big chris rock smile)",

This is an event that millionaires in this field plan on for years and years to even be a part of, let alone get awarded by. They’re on their best behavior and have tons of people around them lobbying for their visibility so they can sell their movies.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if Chris Rock needed a while to process it before either roasting the ever loving shit out of Will Smith (it was such a fucking gross and humiliating thing to do to a grown ass man) or never speaking about it again to protect this fellow representative who clearly had a violent psychotic break. I think he should tear into the Oscars and the room for giving that standing ovation. Like what a bunch of fucking spineless bitches. That was truly dark.\n\nAlso, would Serena Williams dad feel super weird about Will Smith saying they were alike during that weird ass apology?

Will laughed at his wife's hair loss, got caught mid laughter, and received, what any married person would refer to as the death stare. It's a look like, this is exactly what I've been talking about! Will was fucked 6 ways to Tuesday and he knew it. His only chance at saving face, from the argument that was going to rain down on him that evening like the biblical flood, was to go on the offensive. So he stopped laughing and attacked Chris. \n\nNow the real question is did all that prevent the ass chewing from commencing? I think not. A woman's scorn holds no bars. It does not forget. It does not make exceptions. She wasn't pissed at Chris. She was pissed that Will, her husband, disrespected her on live TV by laughing at her.
