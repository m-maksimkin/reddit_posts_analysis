This is the ONLY official website where you can receive it for free and extremely helpful in a country that runs off credit.\n\nPro tip: Request your full background report once from a different bureau every four months. By rotating it this way, you’ll get the most use out of the free report from each bureau and the info reported should be exactly the same from bureau to bureau (not always the case, but discrepancies/errors can be disputed)\n\nSource: Worked at a background screening company.

Updated every three hours. It looks fucking lush.\n\nhttps://map.worldweatheronline.com/ - very similar but a flat 2D map.\n\nOther cool weather map sites:\n\nhttps://www.ventusky.com/ \n\nhttps://www.windy.com\n\nhttps://www.wunderground.com/wundermap\n\nhttps://www.meteoblue.com\n\nhttps://www.accuweather.com/\n\nhttps://whc.unesco.org/en/interactive-map/ - Location of all UNESCO sites.\n\nhttps://time.is/ - 7 million locations, 52 languages, synchronized with atomic clock time. Not quite a map but still good.\n\nhttps://en-gb.topographic-map.com/ - I love this topographic map which helps you clearly visualise the elevations of various areas.\n\nhttps://historicalcharts.noaa.gov/ - this is the best one I can find for ocean topography. However https://seabed2030.org/ aims to change this by 2030.\n\nhttp://metrocosm.com/global-migration-map.html - a visual map of global migration between 2010 and 2015.\n\nhttps://www.lightpollutionmap.info - shows exactly just how much light pollution there is\n\nhttps://darksitefinder.com - looking for the best stargazing locations? use this.\n\nhttps://www.eurobirdportal.org - helps you visualise the bird migration.\n\nhttps://www.carbonmap.org - factual carbon emissions map plus other categories.\n\nhttps://www.carbonbrief.org/interactive-map-historical-emissions-around-the-world\n\nhttps://www.shipmap.org/ - amazing shipping visualisation. However slightly irritating when you click play, it keeps jumping to different countries whilst im in the middle of zooming in a specific area. Make sure that is paused to zoom freely.\n\nhttps://restor.eco/map - just recently launched map of tracking areas with biome restoration.
