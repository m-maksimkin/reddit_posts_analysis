Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",

I find myself taking interest in the most mundane things and knowing that I'll never be able to properly communicate what I found interesting to my sober self. \n\nI also find that sober people actively hate ideas from when we're high. It's like a weird mental block that's a boundary that's impossible to cross. I get paranoid because when I'm high my phone ends up running out of battery with no access to a charger and then I start writing it down in books that go missing. I have a video a friend filmed of me talking about it while high and it is impossible for me to watch it. There's a really strong emotional block there.\n\nMy last experience I came out of it thinking that our minds essentially have a load of parallel monologues going on. That the voice in our head changes without us really being aware, but each voice is still in control of our actions, which is why we do so much subconsciously without understanding why. \n\nSo for example you might go about your day and be on the neutral monologue track, but then you get depressed and you change channel to your depression monologue mode. Once you've changed to this lower state you can look back over the day and feel shit about everything that happened even though you were enjoying the day fine up to that point. This monologue is very closed off and really struggles to derive joy from anything, especially external things.\n\nThe next day you might wake up and get back to neutral and decide to get high and you access a new channel and monologue that seems so much smarter and aware of everything in a more visceral way. You can derive pleasure and interest out of everything, but there's something about the language of this experience that's impossible to translate back to your neutral state just as it's impossible for your neutral state to tell your depressed state that everything is fine.\n\nBeing high makes me feel like my mind has upgraded its operating system and the old operating system can't read files generated by the new operating system. It's like going from 8bit colour to 10bit. \n\nAnyway, I was high last night and this is kind of residual stuff I've been trying to retain from the experience and I really feel like it won't make sense to anyone or even me tomorrow. \n\nI feel like that game Disco Elysium touches on this stuff, but I don't think I'll be able to make sense of it sober.",

Found a .txt on my desktop next morning called \"double slit experiment.\" I vaguely remember starting to think about this, but I don't really remember going as far as to fully write it out.  Seems as good a place as any for it.  \n\n\nImagine shooting a(n ideal for this scenario) projectile across the surface (halfway in and out) of a pond, creating trails of ripples as it travelled, not decelerating until it hits something.  If you set up a double slit experiment in the pond with this in mind, and repeatedly fired projectiles down the surface of the pond toward the slits, I see this happening in my mind:\r  \n\r  \nThe waves in the water from each projectile will still pass through both of the slits, EVEN IF the projectile hits the first wall with the slits and does not go through.  This will not create a result on the reciever (as it is looking for discrete, quantized projectiles) but will still have an affect on the space between the slits and the receiver and create an interference pattern present in the water between the slits and the receiver.\r  \n\r  \nThe part that I'm not certain about is: Would the projectiles that did make it through the slits tend to \"follow\" the interference pattern in the water by sitting in the troughs of previous projectiles?  This might cause the result of showing an interference pattern on the wall with single projectiles over repeated attempts.\r  \n\r  \nI guess what I'm thinking is: Could electromagnetic radiation (the ripple) be a the result of the motion of a photon (the projectile) interacting with some constantly present field (the pond) that photons interact with, making ripples this field as they travel, so that the photons that make it beyond the slits follow the interference pattern left by previous photons in the field?\r  \n\r  \nAn antenna would then possibly be like transmitting energy by singing in this field, and causing a wine glass to resonate from a distance, although probably far more complicated.",

And I really liked that idea and wanted to do something very similar. \n\nSo I thought of this lady who meets different men and the ones she sleeps with.... She collects their smell in a jar and store it in a big shelf container 😂 I dead ass wrote 2 pages of what's happening in the movie and when I sobered up and after figuring out my broken English, it looked really fucking weird.

He was also a big proponent of marijuana legalization. Like, he talked about it all the time. I told him I thought it would be hilarious to go up and ask the cops their thoughts on marijuana legalization. We were both still pretty baked and he thought it was a funny idea too, so on a whim he decided to do it. He took off his jacket and set it on the bench next to him and walked calmly over to their table and began talking with them. I couldn't hear what they were saying but the conversation appeared to be polite and lasted a minute or two. He came back to the table with a big stoned grin on his face. \"Aw man, those cops seem okay to me. They both said they think weed should be legal and it's a waste of their time to go after pot smokers.\"\n\nA little while later the cops finished their food and left. One of them even smiled and nodded to my friend on the way out. We watched them get into their patrol car and drive out of the parking lot.\n\nWe stayed for about another half hour and then left to catch the bus home. We got to the bus stop and just as we both lit up a cigarette a cop car pulled up with the same two cops inside. They had been sitting in the parking lot next door with their lights off waiting for us to come out of the diner. We obviously weren't old enough to be smoking cigarettes, and a check of our IDs confirmed that. They searched both of us and found a five sack of weed and a pipe in my friend's jacket.

One’s clearly an athlete, the other is not. They’re on a football field, running plays. The non-athlete is wearing a whistle and has a clipboard.\n\nVoice over from kid’s mom explaining that her boy’s always wanted to be a coach. Play it over a short montage of kid really putting in the effort.\n\nNow we’re in a doctor’s office. Shots of complicated charts and x-rays. The doctor explains to mom that her son has permanent kid syndrome. He’ll be an adorable 9 year old forever. Mom looks devastated as she stares through the window at her son drawing up offense schemes on a blackboard out in the pediatrician’s waiting room.\n\nJump ahead 8 years. Best friend is now the star quarterback of his high school. Kid is still the kid. High school coach lets kid be in the locker room and on the sidelines; kid is his most valuable assistant and the real brains of the coaching staff. \n\nA scout comes out to watch the best friend. He’s from one of the big schools. Best friend tells the scout he needs to consider the kid for a coaching scholarship. Scout crushes the kid by callously explaining that opportunities like that don’t go out to permanent 9 year olds. \n\nA couple of years later, at college. The program is getting crushed. Coach is desperate. Best friend calls in the kid. Coach scoffs at the idea. But at the next game, down 21-0 at halftime, he swallows his pride and gives the kid a shot. \n\nThey almost win that game, but the other players don’t trust the kid. Montage of kid winning over the team one by one. He coaches the star WR on his algebra. He coaches the senior DE on how to propose to his girlfriend. He coaches the Coach into getting his classic Dodge Charger up and running. \n\nThe team manages to crack the rankings and secure a spot in a bowl game. School finds out about the kid, they’re furious. They fire the Coach. Team refuses to take the field unless the Coach AND the kid are reinstated. Something something the money, Coach and kid walk back into the locker room triumphantly. Coach tells kid the game is his to run.\n\nOut on the field, it’s a hell of a game. Team executes a gutsy play and the kid is shown with his headset and clipboard celebrating with his teammates on the sidelines. In the stands, a spectator leans over to the fan next to them. It’s mom.\n\nSpectator: That kid’s a pretty good coach!\n\nMom: That coach is a pretty good kid.\n\nTITLE: Coach Kid\n\nThat’ll be $100k, pls",

It would give them something to do and interact with on a daily basis, then I woke up the next day and realized that's just a smart watch, and in order for something like that to run it'd have to have some pretty high end tech that kids obviously couldn't afford or parents wouldn't want to spend the money on, if it would even run at all, with the chips and processors we have today in something that small.

Using reaction wheels in the weight, rotate the beam 180°, then move the weight to the other side of the beam. Then repeat. \n\nThe whole point is that the rotation will be around the weight, and by moving the weight in the same direction every time, every rotation would move the beam that much further in a single direction.\n\nWhen I woke up in the morning, it finally clicked in my head why I somehow had solved a well known problem with space travel. I hadn't.\n\nWhen the weight traverses the beam, thanks to fucking Issac Newton, the beam moves backwards.

I’m talking, Samuel L Jackson’s scene in Pulp Fiction (you all know what I mean) level of incredible.  \n\nThe noise from the bar must’ve woken me up, and I immediately thought “wow, I dreamed such incredible dialogue, it’ll never come back to me so I’d better write it down now”. \n\nI jotted it all down on my phones notes, and then went back to sleep.  \n\nThe next day I remembered what I did, so I eagerly opened my notes app expecting this dialogue masterpiece, like the next “There Will Be Blood” and what I got was the biggest fucking string of nonsense bullshit I think I’ve ever read in my life. I’ve seen similar levels of unintelligible gibberish written on a wall in human feces.  \n\nI was disappointed and my vocation firmly remains “*not a scriptwriter*”",

People that are \"magical\" don't have some sorcerous ability.  They just see glimpses of our world and bring them into their world.  Ultimately that's what most fantasy writers do on some level.  They impart some of their world into the fantasy world.  Consider the reference to a \"train\" in Tolkien's work.  And keep in mind that GRR includes anachronistic references in his work as well (\"Giant vs Cowboy\" and \"Hey check out MY kingsguard!  Their cloaks are every color of the rainbow!\"\n\nSo for example: \"The past is written, the ink is dry\" doesn't seem to make a lot of sense because Bran seems able to *change* the past (even though it was already changed, but lets not get into time travel paradoxes here).  But what if the Three-eyed Raven isn't talking about the past of Westeros, but the past of our world?  Nazi Germany happened.  The past is written.  The ink is dry.  Let's make sure it doesn't happen again.\n\nHow about \"The Long Night\"?  Pretty lackluster in the show, right?  But it's just a legend.  It's an echo of our real world and it may not have happened.  Thousand-year Reich, anyone?\n\nFinally there's the concept of \"it's *said* that when a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin\" and the whole \"lets invent Democracy\" end scene.\n\nIt's never confirmed whether the Gods exist, which Gods exist, etc in Game of Thrones.\n\nSo who are the \"Gods\" they are referring to?\n\nWho is flipping the coin?\n\n[We are](https://unaffiliatedcritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Daenerys-in-Game-of-Thrones-3x10-Mhysa.jpg)\n\nDany's vanity was indulged by people.  Jon's was not.\n\nThat's why Dany failed.\n\nSound familiar?  A civil war tearing the kingdom apart?  A vain outside wannabe leader?  Hell: the pale fucking mare (didn't appear in the show IIRC)?  Something that was promised but was never delivered (~~a great wall~~ elephants)?\n\nYeah - this is where I realize the theory is nutty.  But it's so fun.\n\nAnd the story of Game of Thrones isn't about the Game of Thrones.  It's about a sulky bastard finally finding friends.\n\nAnd that's why the final scene is the way it is.\n\nGame of Thrones.",

D fluid mechanics) and i (BS mechanical) thought we’d start up a company that made those laptop privacy screens, but big enough to cover full sized home windows. We figured out the way they work is by having millions of perpendicular fins so that when you looked straight through the film, it minimally obscured the view since you were basically looking at a knife edge. But when you move off center, you viewed more and more of the fins’ sides until they overlapped and your view is completely blocked.\n\nThe million dollar idea was to use this same principle, but have the fins horizontal and applied to windows. That way, in the morning when it was still cool you can get some light into your house, but in the afternoon when everything got too hot and too bright, the film would block out any direct light coming into your home. But since the windows are people height, they would barely obscure your view of the world. You could even adjust when it totally blocked out the sun (but still allowed reflected light off of everything through) by adjusting the spacing between the fins.\n\nAfter an hour of working the details and sobering up, we realized we reinvented blinds.",

It goes a bit deeper though, I had heard that cavemen started eating psilocybin mushrooms and it helped with the development of the human brain and that most animals dont trip and get the same effects from them as humans so where I landed with it was that the ETs put mushrooms on earth for us to discover and use as a means of communication so that we can evolve as a species and that we had co-evolved with them to be keys which uniquely unlock our brains to ET wavelength. I got all my homies on board and kinda started a cult. Half my friends thought we were on to something the other half thought I had lost it.",

Those springs would then be molded into elastic nylon sheaths those sheaths would then be grouped into simulated muscle groups that would be bound to the trapezius and pectoral muscles via a silk mesh that would be threaded both above and below those muscle groups and cross threaded to the adjacent supporting muscle groups.\n\nThe Skeletal structure was comprised of carbon fiber, and had a ball joint at the elbow and at the shoulder. The hand was a nightmare but it came down to ball socketed joints, a knuckle plate, with a silk threaded pulley system that would tie into the end of the nylon muscles for the forearm. The Skeleton would also have anchor points for the synthetic muscle groups to bind to. \n\nThe next day I looked at my notebook substantially hung over. And I saw the so may flaws it wasn’t funny.

I was thinking about a kaggle dataset problem(it's like a competiton for machine learning where you need to code and solve a problem with an algorithm you create). It was a bunch of stocks and you needed to predict the volatility of the stock, based on the slotted trades and actual executed orders. \n\nSo I was thinking on it all day before actually sitting down with it. Later that night, I decided to dabble with the devils lettuce. Sitting out on the patio I had an amazing idea. Group the stocks using a technique of k-means Cluster by grouping them up based on the stock price. So like every 5 or so dollars,  every stock in a similar range would be grouped, then I would use the data from them to predict the unknown one. \n\nI text my wife my plan so as to not forget. The next morning I sat down with a cup of coffee and a brilliant idea. \n\nAll of the stock prices were $1. There was no groups. Plan foiled.",

We chilled in our living room with the goat for a little bit, then we drove around trying to find a house with goats near by to no avail so we took it to a farm that rescues animals.

But my brother didn't get it and just kept saying \"But we are filming...\"\n\nAlso about an hour in we realised that he hadn't been in view the entire time, so in the movie there was going to be this big reveal at the end where there's a wide angle view of the opening scene but my brother isn't there and it's just me talking to myself doing both sides of the discussion. \n\nNow I've typed it all up, it doesn't seem like such a bad idea.

We were discussing life and religion amd this is what we came up with. You be the judge.\n\nRegardless of whether someone may think they've cracked the meaning of life (e.g christianity, islam etc) no evidence would confirm this individual's belief unless death or 'God' confirms his existence to humanity and either 100% supported or disproved (in the case of a science based belief e.g Atheism) this persons theory, in the sense that their belief is correct or not.\n\nHowever, until 'God' proves his existence to humanity, our theory is valid in that that questioning the meaning of life is irrelevant because the belief that it IS relevant cannot be confirmed unless death or 'God' confirms his existence to humanity (which we have no fully proven evidence of so far.)\n\nTherefore the actual meaning of life, is the realisation that questioning the meaning of life is irrelevant, because we are going by a truth that will only be contradicted by death or 'God' proving his existence to humanity. Whereas people who follow either religion or the basis of science rely on no proof until they die, or the confirmation of a 'God'. Making that specific belief a complete non productive use of life unless their specific theory is confirmed. \n\n\nWe propose that religion and science based ways of living are incorrect until proven right. Whereas our theory is correct until proven wrong and enables the individual to live freely with the knowledge of the development of human beings having instinctively learnt the basic universal laws of morality (e.g NO MURDER, RAPE etc) so that all human beings can live together equally as a unified community. Thus validly supporting the idea of each human being living a productive life instead of living a life based on religious or scientific beliefs that lack(s) a productive way of living if their specific belief is only confirmed by events that have not yet occurred.\n\n\n'In conclusion, it is true that we will never know what happens after death (unless the confirming of 'God's' existence in our lifetime) but this theory enables a guaranteed productive life that each individual deserves.'\n\n\n(Our names, redacted) \nFinished 23rd October 2011\n10.40am - 12.40pm\n14 hours\nWith 12 hours being soley conversation that unintentionally contributed to the realization.",

Plus what happens after you die as the animal? \n\nAlso couldn’t understand how money was so valuable. I mean it’s just a piece of paper right? How is a piece of paper so important and why can’t we just print more of it? Lesson for any kids who was in my position. Money is only a representation backed by something of value. Some countries have oil backing their money, some have gold backing their money, some countries have nothing valuable backing their country and the money is worthless or they printed more money than they had valuables to back it. Basically if you have $10 trillion in gold, $2 trillion in oil and $1 trillion in goods then your net worth is $13 trillion but that’s not including the trading you do and what your yearly gdp is. The dollar is only as meaningful as the business and goods to back it, so if you go into major debt or print more money than goods you own the money will lose its worth.

One time while too drunk to drive for more beer and using this service I decided that there should be a specific service that delivers you any food from any restaurant. I was told that that was dumb and no one would use it so I accepted it as another one of my super drunk stupid ideas.  I'm sure it wasn't a very unique idea because doordash and whatnot were about 10 years away so people were clearly already thinking about it.  It's one of those things where if I were a trust fund kid and had the time and money I probably could have made that work.  But instead I was a drunk fun kid and that idea went by the wayside.",

The mighty music of the triumphal march into nothingness reverberated through my brain, and filled me with a sense of infinite possibilities, which made me an archangel for the moment. The veil of eternity was lifted. The one great truth which underlies all human experience, and is the key to all the mysteries that philosophy has sought in vain to solve, flashed upon me in a sudden revelation. Henceforth all was clear: a few words had lifted my intelligence to the level of the knowledge of the cherubim. As my natural condition returned, I remembered my resolution; and, staggering to my desk, I wrote, in ill-shaped, straggling characters, the all-embracing truth still glimmering in my consciousness. The words were these (children may smile; the wise will ponder): 'A strong smell of turpentine prevails throughout.'\"",

(L ron Hubbard being the founder of Scientology) (and Allaster Crowley being a founder of a prominent satanic religion at the time.) \nSo in my drug addled mind I became aware of a vast satanic conspiracy to control the space program for a nefarious satanic reason. \n\nSo yea wasted a night making a graph of how this all worked.",

The idea is that a pod would descend at a predetermined location and you could climb inside. Then it would retract into the sky a safe distance (higher than buildings but probably lower than planes?) and you would plug in your destination…and then just wait. The Earth’s natural rotation beneath you would eventually bring your destination around (your pod could slide along to adjust for latitude) and when the time came the pod would lower you again and you would arrive.

Once a society is infected with Christianity, it is hard to get it out. There is a correlation with Christianity and loyalty to an nation and willingness to serve military duty.

Which is why you always seem to come up with the \"BEST\" ideas ever when you're stoned: Your brain is having trouble accessing the memory circuits that tell you, \"I've seen/heard/done this before\" and so you \\*feel\\* as if you're discovering things for the first time. \n\nProbably why people tend to feel like they're more creative when they're stoned, too.

I thought, buy a nice house and make it the perfect place for CSNY to stay when they came to town to play a show. Since i knew EVERY SINGLE THING about them, i could cater to their every whim or desire. Their favorite foods, home cooked, 1000tc sheets, plush beds, sofas, anything! Well, it WAS a great idea. 3 girls in Ft. LAUDERDALE did exactly that and it worked. CSN and Y thank them on their albums. That's how I found out they did my idea. Son of a BITCH!!!!!",

I has seen the movie once or twice before and liked it, but when I was watching it that time, I had a huge epiphany about it.  \n\nLike there was some whole other subtext to the movie beyond what was going on with the story in the song lyrics and everything, I just got this amazing message underneath it all that tied the whole movie together and explained it on another level, and it made compete sense to me at the time.  \n\nBut after the next day I just couldn’t quite put my finger on whatever the hell it was.  Or ever since!  Honestly I’m quite sure there really isn’t any secret meaningful subtext to the whole story other than what’s mostly on the surface and the themes that can be interpreted from the lyrics.    It’s just that LSD sometimes can cause us to feel something akin to meaningful connections with others or, for me, the fictional characters and a movie i guess.   \n\nIt’s like I tricked my brain into feeling like I completely understood something by mimicking whatever chemical process your brain has for that.

            "text": "I took ten hits of acid at Warped Tour years ago. I was a goddamn idiot. \n\n\nSo would take 2 hits about every 30 minutes or so when they would dissolve in the mouth I would pop some more in. It's not the most efficient way to take them but I wasn't aiming for what happened. Of course any logical thinking I had went out the window. I didn't plan to take them all, I wanted to share. But I didn't. \n\n\nThe peak started around 8 or 830, it was late July so the Sun was setting in the west and the moon was coming up in the east. I thought that was so incredible. The band on stage was Simple Plan. I enjoyed their music. It's about humanity. All of their songs explain fundamental human emotions. We all want to find love, be happy, enjoy life, we get angry, jealous, sad, and we just want to avoid that even though they are beautiful in their own way. \n\n\nI had complete Ego death. I realized we are all just pieces of the universe that is councious of itself. Every human is a different tendril of the universe experiencing the beauty of life in every possible circumstance. Some of us get to experience being in a crowd listening to the band, and I'm the same as the person on stage playing, and we are the same as the boy in Africa or the woman in China, we are all tendrils of the universe experiencing different lives but are fundamentally the same. \n\n\nWe are all just energy, atoms in space and time, fundamentally just frequencies of vibrations that cause certain atoms to exist, which arrange in such a way to allow conscious thought. We will all live and experience the same emotions, we will all die and our energy will scatter across the universe. Our consciousness will return to the universe, to the universal mind or consciousness which all things extend from. We are all the same, and we should ourselves, and by extension should love everyone else. \n\n\nI felt as though there were maybe 7 major points that made up this circle of life, consciousness, and existence and I felt as though I had connected 6 of these 7 major points and that if I was able to connect this last point, to truly grasp the nature of everything, that I would be truly enlightened and would cease to exist in my body. I thought I might die and return to the universal consciousness because human beings aren't able to exist in the physical world while knowing and having experienced the true nature of the universe. There is no one God, we are all God, and we are all one. The universe is God, and we are the universe, and we are love. \n\n\n I felt I was on the cusp on True enlightenment. I felt love, I felt content, I felt sadness and empathy, I felt overwhelming gratitude, I felt no worries about my future. I existed in the present moment, and as it always was and always will be, it was perfect.  I had no qualms about passing thus physical life and entering back into the universal consciousness, the one mind. All was well. \n\n\nI remember trying as hard as I could, writing this all out in a Facebook post on my phone. I needed to share this with the world before I forgot it, or before I died and couldn't share it. It was of the utmost important that others know this and experience this. Maybe we can find world peace if everyone can experience this. Luckily my phone died just as I was finishing up the Facebook post because I may have been committed to a mental instituon if I had been able to post it. \n\n\nI blacked out. I have a few memories of that time. I remember a black guy with big bug eye like sunglasses and I was trying to explain this to him, and he was kindly listening with a big smile on his face agreeing with me. No doubt looking back that he encountered a lunatic having a psychotic drug induced break and was agreeing with me as one might with a child who one wants to appease. I heard an ambulance at one point and remember hearing people ask \"are you okay?\" \"What's wrong?\" And other concerned questions. Were they talking to me? Where am I? Who am I? \n\n\nI came to while looking for the people I had come to the concert with. I was frantically trying to find them as it was time for us to go. Alas, my phone was dead, so I was really just wandering around aimlessly, hopelessly lost, frantically searching for someone to ground me to reality. \n\n\nAll in all, it was incredible and one of the most meaningful experiences I've ever had. It all felt so real. Was I really experiencing enlightenment, or was I just under the influence of drugs that severely warped my perception of reality? What was reality? I still think about this experience now. It's been years and I still don't know how to feel about it. Was I the same as any other stupid hippy who has \"Deep thoughts?\" Or did I experience something that few people ever get to experience. I don't know, but I still think the world would be a better place if more people experienced that. \n\n\nAll that being said, be safe, practice harm reduction, always have a trip sitter, don't trip in public, and don't do dangerous things. This isn't meant for everyone and drugs should be researched and tested and used safely if one chooses to indulge.",

But there were just some repeating tasks, which you could do to make more money in the game, like the business stuff in GTA, but to make this faster, you were able to buy some boosters with coins. But you have to buy the coins with real money haha. But you could earn those coins with minigames, which you could only play every few hours,\nand on top of that, the minigames were competitive against other players, and the winner gets all your coins. But the minigames were also a pay-to-win game with buyable objects itself. At any other point there were also gambling machines involved with lootbooxes and shit.. i don't remember correctly.\n\nAnd as longer we got further with the idea of the devilish-snowball-pyramide-scheme-cashgrab-game, we laughed and giggled more and more.",

I got super high and mowed the lawn while listening to Taylor Swift’s Folklore album (I’m probably not someone you’d expect would listen to her, just FYI). \n\nAnyways, I had this idea to establish a percent for universal healthcare by implementing this on a local level. This would mean EVERY citizen in a county/city would be “offered” the county/city (to make this easier we will say “city”) healthcare via a one time payment through their taxes. If a business were to open in said city, they would pay a tax to the healthcare initiative for having a business in the city. However, an incentive could be given for x amount of employees who sign up for the city healthcare since they work IN THE CITY (even if they do not live there).\n\nThe only expectation would be that any Medical Practice (hospital, Primary, OB) would be covered. Even, maybe, a minimum copay if needed (like $25-50). Everyone would have a deductible as well. \n\nSomeone wants more coverage, they can pay extra. But everyone, every child, every senior gets a baseline version of healthcare paid for by their own taxes. Because you tax businesses as well, their is an incentive to grow the pool of those on the plan. \n\nAlso, because wealthier people will most likely pay more for premium plans while also being less at risk, they will help (not resolve) but help cover the cost of lower income people. \n\nIf you would like to attend a practice outside of the city system. Cool, a larger deductible can be paid unless there are no such services provided in the city that also meet the set standards of excellence set by the city and a team of experts in each field. \n\nIf it works, this system could be implanted at a larger scale (county) and then moved to a regional level with local governments and then moved to a state level. \n\nAny thoughts, ideas, criticism (be positive at least) is well accepted.

You could also make like a whole festival out of it in whichever country is chosen to do it, people from all over the world could come and celebrate the music and culture of said country and the money gathered from the festival would pay for the probe, given to charity or help out whatever needs the country has. \n\nWhilst also aiding space exploration and hopefully aliens.",

They rush to the hospital and Hank is PISSED cuz he misunderstood the details of a car accident and thinks that Lucky was driving drunk with Luanne and Gracie in the vehicle but it turns out none of them were drunk at all. Then he’s lead to believe all 3 of them are dead and he’s immediately distraught and in his emotions about all his anger and his hatred over the years that came out on Lucky and Luanne. Then by some miracle baby Gracie survived the accident and Peggy has to go to court to keep Luanne’s mother away from taking custody of her. Meanwhile Hank still dealing with repressed emotions wants to take aim at drunk driving. He finds out the driver that killed Lucky and Luanne was underaged but served alcohol at a festival put on by his favorite beer Alamo. He tries to meet with Alamo’s superiors to kick someone’s ass but he’s never able to get through them. He finds out that Alamo is not only not apologetic about serving an underaged drinker but they feel like the government will protect them from everything. This leads Hank to a years long journey to become the Governor of Texas. Hilarity ensues as call backs and regulars are all featured on Hank’s journey. The movie ends with Peggy and Hank winning custody of Gracie and Hank becoming Governor of Texas in a landslide. The screen goes black and shows the King of the Hill logo with a touching tribute to Brittany Murphy and Tom Petty in a recording booth. \n\nWhile I don’t think sober me thought this was a stupid idea but the series finally was absolutely perfect and ending with a movie is somewhat redundant.",

The app would be called Whiff, and could be used to identify whatever scent you were smelling at the time. It happens all the time, youre with out with some buddies and out of nowhere you all smell something amazing and have no idea where its coming from; with the Whiff app, in only a matter of seconds you can find out exactly what the smell is and even where its coming from, but how you may ask? My high ass came up with an answer. The Whiff scent database would be open and available for all users to access, allowing you to log your favorite scents, and where they originated. That way, as the app grows and more people download it, you’ll have millions of specific scents that can finally be identified. The only flaws I found with this app idea was that the technology to make all this work would probably be very difficult to acquire and also there would be a LOT of farts, and I mean a lot.

You start to drift asleep when suddenly you realize \"I have to take a piss!\" You know you are going to be up and down the rest of the night/morning as that case of beer winds it's way through your body and evacuates through your bladder.\n\nThen you remember you made one of the wisest purchasing decisions ever: The Home Cather System™. Modeled after the in-the-wall vacuums found in fancy houses in the 1980s it consists of a port near the bed with a retractable house and a receptacle installed in the attic or garage. While remaining in bed you simply pull the retractable hose, insert it into your uretha, and drift away knowing you can remain in bed without fear of an embarrassing accident.\n\nAct now and we'll include at no extra charge one of our deluxe pre-lubed retractable hoses to avoid any...discomfort...upon removal.\n\nCall in the next 27 minutes and we'll also include free installation and an extra port for your gaming room. Never hold up your guild's raid again.\n\n(Ask about our new Dookie Removal System, patent pending. Sold separately.)",

So many laughs and stories and interesting things. There would always be like some amazing invention idea or some hilarious inside joke that came out of them, but later after sobering up, I'd never remember any of it because we were so baked. So my friends and I, also while a little stoned talked about a tiny camera you could put on a pipe when you pass it around a session.  Then you could record the session and relive it vicariously, and never forget the funny stuff that came about. My friends and I thought it was revolutionary, we could have an entire booth at festivals dedicated to just that, and then sell copies of the sessions to the participants for 5$. We never figured out if it would be like emailing a file, or giving everyone a Microsd card with the video on it? Idk, we didn't think that far ahead. We even had a really cool name for it: The SmokeaBowlPro (like a go pro but for your smoke sessions). \n\nYeah it turns out, when we were sober, we cringed at the thought of smoking pot on camera or being recorded at all. How would we market it? \"Come inside, we want to film you smoking and sell the video to you when you leave!\"",

This way people can incorporate some of this feedback from the robot in order to solve the problem. I personally would find it very useful if someone actually recapped what has been in a serious argument (objectively) so that I don‘t lose my train of thought. There are scholarly articles written about this but no one has actually put this idea into action yet and obviously there are many hurdles to overcome in order to make this reality but technically it is possible.

You could clip it to keys, the TV remote, your wallet etc, and push the button when you lost them and just follow the beeping sound.\n\nWe were pumped aboit it, wrote down some notes on how it would work... The next day we sat down sober in the students common room and basically realized so many flaws.... what if they were out of range? Where would keep the button, at home? What if you lost your wallet ok vacation and didn't have the button? If you carry the button, why not just carry your keys etc, it's just another thing to carry... And what about batteries?

            "text": "Once, when my wife and I were stoned as hell, we came up with, and thoroughly developed, an idea called Car Buddies. We did UI mock ups, use case analysis, a Kickstarter pitch, everything.\n\nThe gist of it was to let drivers communicate with each other on the road. You'd press a button on your dash or phone app, and it would bring up a list of cars on the road with you within a small radius. Then you'd select the car you wanted to talk to (the blue Acura to the left) and send them a voice message.\n\nThe applications of this idea were numerous:\n\n1. You could use it to break up the monotony of long road trips. You'd be like \"hey guys! This is the red Mazda, where y'all headed? Oh cool, Phoenix? Yea, we're going to LA! Let's hang until exit 27\"\n\n2. You could casually let people know something is up with their car. You'd ping them and be like \"hi, silver Ford Focus? Yea, your back right tire looks wobbly, better get that checked out. Also your blinker's been on since exit 27\".\n\n3. You could apologise for accidentally being a dick, thus helping reduce incidents of road rage, like \"oh hi, sorry, red Volvo here, sorry to cut you off there back at exit 27. I didn't realize the lane was ending; I don't take this road often. Sorry again!\" And they'd message back like \"no worries, friend, stay safe!\"\n\n4. You could notice something about their car, like a \"Baby on Board\" or \"Student Driver\" sticker and chat about a shared experience. \n\n5. Emergency vehicles could broadcast messages to all the cars on the road, advising them which lane to actually be in.\n\nThe possibilities were endless. The biggest problem we were trying to solve before passing out was market penetration (heh). An app like this only makes sense if everyone is on board, so we were trying different avenues and pitch strategies for integration with Waze/Google Maps, maybe some Bluetooth foo, or whatever OnStar uses?\n\nIt wasn't until we looked over our labors the next day that we realized this whole thing is a terrible **terrible** idea. Friendly happy people from our high fantasy would be way too shy to use something like this, and people who aren't would just use it to export their road rage to everything in sight.",

But enjoy my high writing that's full of fantasy tropes, reddit~\n\n**Prologue**\n\nThe scene is a desperate one. X is slowly turning to stone, fighting his way through hoards of skelebros. He has numerous wounds on his body, protecting Sithe, the girl he loves with all his life. The girl is prophesized to die of a disease, and is dying, so X is going to The Timekeeper to change fates, something that is thought of as impossible by frail humans. He is fighting through hoardes of undead, just on the gates of the Timekeeper, and is simultaneously turning to stone, when he almost petrifies and the girl dies when a skelebro knifes her breast. The stabbing scene will be the epilogue while the prologue is simply the desperate struggle of a petrifying man, carrying his girlfriend in his arms. The girl is a religious fuck who doesnt think anyone other than the gods can change fate. She dies in her love's arms, praying to the gods, disbelieving his ability to alter fates by his own two hands, killed by a skelebro. \n\n**the story is man's struggle to change things on his own, against the will of gods**\n\n\n**Main Plot:**\n\n\nThe main story starts with a man of legends. A warrior who is infinitely known as but a story. The story begins with the beginning of his life. His early years and how he was thrown in an unfair and unkind world, with no one but his own self. Then slowly he reaches a semi stable place where he fights. He is a beast, and audience to one of his matches is this religious girl person, who meets him and tells him that he is nought but a monster, who kills for himself and doesnt do the deed of gods. She tells him that he cannot challenge fate by his own, Unworthy, calloused, imperfect hands. They fall in love, and just when they are about to fall for each other, he encounters a being who predicts their fate, telling him that she will die of disease, and nought else. And their love will be known all around the world as an example against stupid things and such. His struggle is to encounter the Timekeeper, to reverse this Fate. This is how he slowly reached the Timekeeper, setting up the epilogue.\n\n**Brief Epilogue**\n\nThe death of his lover is the epilogue. When all hope seems lost. When the MC's deeds have been wasted, and the world seems hopeless and unfair. [Remains to be enlarged, so that the Timekeeper, angry with the Gods for blemishing his untainted honours, gives the MC a labour to somehow bring down gods and then his girlfriend will be revived]\n\n**Characters+ Book 2**\n\nThe Timekeeper: a timeless entity whose very presence is lineked to the roots of the very world they all exist in. He is a simple being, who is all powerful, even more so than the Gods, but knows nothing but his duty towards the Fates and keeping the timelines or whatever untangled. Is something like the Knight, our Vessel, in Hollow Knight, in eays like- No mind to think, no body to be hurt or some shit and no voice to cry suffering. In the emd, impressed by the MC's deeds and simultaneously angered beyond measure by the Gods' fuckery with the Fates, he becomes Corrupted Timekeeper, grows a mouth and details the deed that X needs to do to vring down the Gods, so tha Fates gets avenged and then he will revive the girlfriend.

The majority of people don’t know how to properly cook a steak right? It’s either underdone and too bloody so you put it back on the grill and immediately it’s over done shoe leather. So here’s the deal: \n\n Steaks are cut into jigsaw puzzle pieces with the puzzle difficulty being in direct correlation with how you want your steak cooked. \n\nRare? Maybe three pieces. You jumble them up, throw them on the grill then by the time you turn them and reassemble them into the original steak - done! \n\nWell done? 15 maybe 16 pieces you throw out there. You’re turning them over and upside down trying to get them all to fit back into the single steak shape and with it being that difficult once you get it- well done! \n\nMeat puzzles! (all rights reserved) \n\nI have no idea how you’d go about selling that and now that I’ve written it out I can see I was probably higher than I originally thought but still— MEAT PUZZLES!

I called my friends and we had some drugs and a party. After the party we decide to watch a one of my early favourite horror movie (which I love but It does not scare me or make me feel the same as I first watched). My parents have a really good home cinema which used to be mine in school days. We live in area where the houses are a little apart with a huge uncut garden. So it was fucking cold outside. In my country we usually don't have heater as the winter are short and not particularly unbearable cold.\n\nWe watched the movie. Whole time we were watching it we were all screaming and really terrified. By screaming I mean the screams that would scare the neighbours. We were terrified when the movie ended. After that during the climax we ran away because the empty quiet house seemed scary and we went to neighbour. We knocked and she saw us without our red eyes and expression. She took us in our room and called my parents.\n\nSo, the entir neighbourhood now know that I do drugs, my parents were very angry. But I loved that I enjoyed that movie more than the first time I watched it.\n\nNever did it again while at home.",

Was I satisfied just dealing with it even though women told me I had was had the perfect penis? Well if that were true then where would my Butch girlfriend be the 49 year old to my 33 years old even though I look like I could be 21 or 18 because she's never here she used me for sex just like everybody else and then she dicked out on me and if she's never over and I didn't cry anymore and you're alone and it's nice big room that could house myself all of myselves. I just like to thank the seemingly one person who knows exactly what I look like or would have looked like almost as Moika.

I figured out the equations to find how many numbers were to the left of the chosen number and how many pairs of numbers there were that added up to that number. \n\nSo with our example of 5, and looking at the number line (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9...) we can see that there are 4 numbers to the left of the chosen number, and there are 2 pairs of numbers that add up to 5 (1+4, 2+3). \n\nI was incredibly proud of what I figured out, and kinda felt like i had discovered something new. I had written it down, so the next day I looked at it again, and realized that to find the numbers to the left, just subtract 1 from your number, and for the number of pairs, just divide by 2 and round down to the nearest whole number... nothing groundbreaking at all, and something just about anybody could figure out.",

I don't remember why but I think I was feeling upset that other people my age have all these cool drunk / getting high stories so I guess I wanted to get drunk because it would be cool. I tried to get drunk a few times and it turns out I could hold my liquor. So I ended mixing 7 different kind of whiskeys with the added touch of moonshine in a 24 oz cup. I downed it in my room while my family was asleep (around 12 at night). My memory goes blank a few minutes later but I wake at 11:00 am in the morning still drunk (apparently that can happen, didn't know at the time.) Decided to fall asleep again and woke up again around 3 pm with a killer hang over (which I also learned that could last for multiple days) and my room that was totalled and covered in pee. To make matters worse I was talking to a friend at the time I was drunk and I also learned that I am a very talkative drunk and told every secret I had. I haven't drank since.\n\nTl;dr\nIm stupid and could have killed myself by alcohol poisoning and embarrassed myself in front of my friend",

Probably the most fun trip I’ve ever had.\n\nAfter staring at the living, melting floral wallpaper in his kitchen for an indeterminable amount of time, we made a short trek out to the edge of his neighborhood where there was a small pond.\n\nSitting on the bank of that pond, delirious from laughter, I stumbled upon a comedic gold idea that still amuses me to this day:\n\nBest described as the tasteful and artistic combination of two long-coveted indulgences that most can appreciate regardless of orientation, chili cheese and titties. Also known as chili cheese titties or simply “chitties.”\n\n(For safety, chili should be only slightly warmer than room temp. Vegan chili substitute also works well)",

Before we knew, we were making and using as many bongs as possible, out of things ranging from soda bottles, liquor containers, to eventually food items like hollow bell peppers and such.. however, we didn't take into account that food spoils after a certain time period.. so one day after work, we sat down around 5pm and just grinded up some real kill bud, and loaded a bowl we rigged into a bong, made out of one of those mini water melons. It had sat for I don't know how long until we used it again. So my homie goes to take the first rip, and a deep one indeed.

            "text": "Yeah, this might not sound like anything related to getting drunk but is closer to what you may call as \"high\".\nToday was Guru Purnima, and in the evening there was an online Satsang (which can be understood as a meet) with Sadhguru.\nWe've been having these satsangs for about 4 months now, on full moons, and each time he introduces us to various types of meditations.\nTonight's meditation was on Akash (ether). It was a 20 minute meditation, but this one had a lot of instructions from Sadhguru. He wanted us to sit relaxed in a way that wouldn't stress our back or neck.\nThe experience of this meditation was unique, and 20 minutes felt like just 3-5 minutes. He made us consciously enter a trance like state, and it felt really great.\nBut my favorite one was the meditation on the water-element. I really got high with that. I don't remember how exactly it was done but it felt so good. The meditations happen on full moons, every month. It's called Full moon flirtations, if any of you would like to explore.\nYou don't have to draw smoke or fill up with chemicals to get high, just do what works efficient.\nEven if you take in something, it actually only triggers stuff already within the body. Hope you guys try it out.",

There's a gap in my memory but I remember we were up all night playtesting, and when I woke up the next day to look at my deck (I run shaddolls) I was so fuckin confused. The monstrosity I created apparently bodied him like 9 to 2 as I tweaked it over the night. This deck was a Mashup of 2 archetypes that by all means shouldn't work, but did. I somehow fused shaddoll with red eyes. I figured out how to play it sober enough to remember and went tabletop with my other cousins, battle Royale style. They all 3 targeted me with dismissal, exodia, and phantom knights. I beat them all 1v3 and most of them won't play anymore. So it ended up being a good idea. Won a couple locals with it",
