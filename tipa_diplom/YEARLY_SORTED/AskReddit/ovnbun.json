I'm over hear on the couch tearing up as my little girl sings 4 non Blondes obliviously across the room.\n\nOkay, so Wishes are awesome and here is why: these kids are going through or have gone through stuff that leaves a mark on them. Physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually; these kids and their families have taken a beating.\n\nWe found out our daughter had severe heart issues before she was born. We were advised to terminate the pregnancy by one of the doctors who were trying to explain what this meant for us and our daughter. Three months later, she was born 4 weeks premature and was airlifted from the hospital to the closest children's hospital (5 miles, but she's a princess already). Nine days later she has her first open heart surgery, so she's had a scar on her chest as long as she can remember.\n22 days later, we take her home, which is amazing seeing that kids who are in the top 10% go home after a month, and some never do. My wife built a friendship with the mom of the girl in the room next to us. Her daughter and ours shared a variation of the same name. Her daughter did not have a positive outcome. Survivors guilt.\n\nAnyway, little girl came home. We went into lock down. No one in or out unless you basically bathed in hand sanitizer because of how susceptible to infection she was. Isolation\n\nEverything about our daughter was critical. We measured how much she ate, how much she weighed, what her oxygen saturation was. We had to log everything. Oh, and she refused to eat. She had to be right at that little gap between asleep and awake to eat anything. Too awake and she would fight and spit it all back up. Too asleep and she would aspirate. Lack of sleep and stress.\n\nThings progressed. We went to her cardiologist every other week. She grew and developed a wonderful personality. Awesome! But we were on the lookout for her next surgery. When this one started to be ineffective, they have to do something different. Constant heightened sense of awareness.\n\nAt 9 months, she had her second surgery. They changed some of the plumbing in her heart, and it raised her blood pressure in her head and torso. She had constant headaches until she adapted to it. We left the hospital after 2 weeks with a little girl who hurt all the time. She adjusted to it, but we had to keep an eye on things because once her sats got low, it would be time for her third surgery. If her heart made it that far. Our girl wanted to run and play, but after about 10 minutes of activity, she had to rest for an hour. We used supplemental oxygen occasionally, always had it, just in case. Toward the end of her 3rd year, she didn't run much. Most of her time was spent just lounging. This girl loves the outdoors. Loves hiking. Any sort of nature activity. So, I would put her in the pack and we would hike. She would walk for a few minutes and I would carry for an hour or so. We were all tired. We were scared, but none of us would say as much.\n\nHer third surgery was in 2017. She was 4. This one she remembers. Waking up naked and hurting with tubes and wires literally everywhere. Three chest tubes, IVs in both arms and a foot, arterial line in her neck, and catheterized. She did not handle the restraints well, but there wasn't much we could do. Within 48 hours they had her out of bed. 48 hours after having her body cooled down, her hear stopped and replumbed, she was taking steps.\nMy girl is the sweetest thing ever. She really is. She cried, but was always polite and understanding. She rode around in a wagon handing out stickers to the nurses. But, pulling lines was a fight. I'm sure it hurt. Her arterial line was the worst. Her nurses let her help pulling that one. It was the only way to keep her focused and not freak out.\n\n\nSo, I said all that to drive home the point of what a Wish is: it is an escape for reality. It is the opportunity to not think about the treatments of the past or the prognosis of the future. My daughter chose a Disney vacation. Give Kids the World, the resort that Wish kids use, is a thing to behold. They pamper your kid. Ice cream, mani/pedi, mini golf, pizza and cookies, they mayor drops by to read a bedtime story, characters for Disney and Universal come by for those who are mobility limited, it is awesome. And the Disney experience is something that few people will ever be able to achieve. You want to meet Chewbacca? Here's the front of the line! You want to sit and talk with Ariel? No problem, you guys wait here while we bring another Ariel for the guests, this one is yours! Rey give you a hug, Buzz and Woody are at your disposal. Nothing is an inconvenience, and you waiting for anything is not an option. For reference, the main ride for the Avatar was a 3 hour line. We walked up, through the door and were in the ride without breaking stride.\nAll the Disney parks were at our disposal. Universal and Legoland as well. My girl was up early, running hard, and down late. I got to see her be a \"normal\" kid. I got to see her see herself as a normal kid.\n\nThat Wish replaced all the bad things she had been through. All that stories about \"Remember that time in the hospital\" got over written by \"Remember that time at Disney/Universal/Give Kids the World\"\n\nWishes, and especially the people involved in making them a reality are a special breed. I encourage everyone to find a way to be a part of it. Only about half the eligible kids get their wish granted.",

They travel to the family’s home or a public place, help with paperwork, and send the family off on their wish experience. It’s the most time intensive of the volunteer commitments, but extremely rewarding. Another former employee went into detail earlier in the thread.\n\n- Translator/interpreter volunteers accompany wishgranting volunteers on wishes (or help out over the phone) to help ensure every family feels comfortable, heard and understood throughout the whole process.\n\n- Event employees help out with fundraising events like walk a thons, golf outings, and galas, helping to check people in, coordinate logistics, and make sure everyone has a great experience\n\n- Office volunteers help around the chapter offices, stuffing envelopes for holiday mailings, filing paperwork, etc.\n\nYour local chapter might have more opportunities beyond the ones I’ve listed - check them out here: \n\nhttps://wish.org/volunteer",

Their faces were lit up. After they left, I had to take a half a day off, I couldn't keep myself together.

Here are a few of my favorites (as best as I can remember them):\n\n1)I wish to be a worker in a pickle factory. Turns out that during his chemotherapy, the child’s favorite food became pickles and was one of the few things he could manage to enjoy so he wanted to meet the “people who put the pickles in jars.” The organization made it into a big deal and you bet those pickle factory workers were thrilled to experience his joy that day. There was a photo in the office of this little boy in a hair net with a beaming smile as he watched pickle spears move by on a conveyor belt. Melts my heart.\n\n2) I wish to have the experience of a WWII fighter pilot who crashed on a deserted island. During some of his hospital stays, this wish kid had visits from a few veterans who told visit the hospital and tell him stories of their experiences. He became really interested in military history. MAW worked with a big contingent of people from Hawaii, including the U.S. military, flew him to a little uninhabited island in Hawaii, and he got to experience (with his dad and a few safety experts) what it was like to be “deserted” for about 48 hours.\n\n3) I wish to have a pet dragon. This was a tough one (out of Idaho I believe) to make happen, but this child wanted a “pet dragon he could train”. So the volunteers started thinking about how they could make this happen and stumbled across someone who had some experience in this kind of thing…the creator of the Furby. MAW set up a meeting between the two to help design it, and the wish kid was able to eventually get a a little mechanical, very lifelike (think Toothless) dragon he could train.\n\n4) I wish to be a National park ranger. This wish was featured on CBS Sunday Morning. This wish kid loved the outdoors and national parks had played an important role in how his mom had met some important people in her life. He spent a few days learning the ropes of being a ranger at Yosemite National Park and was even named an honorary park ranger.\n\n5) [I wish to go to Mars](https://youtu.be/P9Q8Ed8IjVg)\n\nI’ll reply to this post to more as I remember them. It was such a great experience. What I loved the most about MAW is when volunteers first sit down with kids, they literally learn about what interests this child, what makes them tick…they ask them “if you could wish for anything, what would it be.” This process gives them the opportunity to think about all the possibilities. Some kids have very specific requests; others simply want to go to Disney World. But ultimately this wish is so individualized that it is the perfect wish for that child. And there are a ton of benefits to the child and the family. It’s a great organization.\n\nAlso feel free to ask me any questions.\n\n[edit: some spacing issues]",

I probably still have the master tape.\n\nAround 25 years ago in the mid 90s, in the town I lived in up in the far north-west of Scotland, there was a Community Radio Station.  We were trying to set up a local radio station so we had a six-week run using borrowed equipment from Moray Firth Radio to gauge popularity and interest.\n\nNow the first programme in the evening after the news was one run by a couple of high school kids.  We'd get a few kids in, they'd record a few idents and stuff, we'd run the idents, then at five past five their show would go up.  Tunes they liked, shout-outs to their friends, that kind of thing.  They \\*loved\\* it.  They had a blast, just tremendous fun.\n\nNow there was one wee guy who was a wheelchair user who wanted to do a programme but he couldn't get into the studio because it wasn't wheelchair accessible - it was up a long flight of stairs in the old nurses' accomodation in the local hospital, and there aren't many wheelchair-user nurses (and certainly not in the 50s when the hospital was built!).  He couldn't even be carried up the stairs because he had severe spinal problems that meant that his back, chest and internal organs were pretty squashed and he had to be moved very carefully.  He was one very sick wee boy, and there was no way he was getting up to the studio.  He was totally out of luck on that one.\n\nNo, he wasn't, though, was he?  Because it occurred to me, he could tape his programme with one of the portable recorders we had (little Marantz high-speed cassette recorder), give me a track listing, and I'd cut it together, play it to him, and if he was happy we'd play it out for him.  He wouldn't get to do it live, but next best thing eh?\n\nSo, we did.  I dropped off the tape recorder, microphone and so on, and a day or so later I collected it from him with his running order, track list, and a stack of CDs.  Perfect.  He even sounded like he'd really bashed on his script and sounded pretty damn good.  Copy the tape to 1/4\", copy the tunes to 1/4\", edit it down, and boom.\n\nExcept!  He had a cold.  A snuffly snottery cold.  Every sentence was punctuated with <SNIIFFF>  <SNURK>  <SNUMPH> snotty noises.\n\nI can tell you now that a <SNIIIFFF> is about |---------------------------------| that long on 3-3/4 inch per second 1/4\" tape, and also cats absolutely love to play with all this brown tickertape confetti you're flooding the bedroom (where my editing gear was) with, and there were dozens of them.  Eighteen hours of cutting, sticking, redubbing, finding a bit of dead air juuuust the right tone to fill the gap, cutting, sticking...\n\nBut when his programme went to air?  He sounded fucking amazing.",

We decided that we should really know a few more songs before we went, so trekked to a record shop (in her wheelchair) and asked the young guy for their album. “Which one?” Turned out they had released 3 records already! \n\nWhen we got to the concert, we thought the warm-up act was the real band and were gobsmacked to see 5 guys in One Direction as we thought there were only 4 (apparently since then, one quit). When they sang a cover of ‘Teenage Dirtbag’ by Wheatus and the young girls in front of us announced ‘OMG this is their new song, it’s so relevant’, we knew we were far too old to be there.\n\nAlso, as the concert was mostly 12-17 year olds, the bars were closed!

But he was 5’8, all heart, he was just like Rudy in that Notre Dame football movie. He fought it for 6 years. Somewhere around his 22nd birthday he and I were talking about having something worth living for. I told him it didn’t matter what it was but a vision for the future that he would fight for was important and encouraged him to find something to give his life too. We went on a vacation soon after that, and because we were broke from medical bills and four years of battling cancer as a family, this was a HUGE deal. We hadn’t had a family vacation for a long time. A family friend put us up in their beach house and gave us some money to have a good time there. My brother came ALIVE on the trip. It was so impactful to him that he came home and decided to start a non profit organization. He called it “A Week Away”. It was very similar to make a wish - terminally sick patients apply and benefit from an all expenses paid vacation with their family or group of caregivers. That was a big deal to him to include the family because, if you’ve ever gone through something like that, you know it’s not just the patient who suffers and loses their freedom, it’s everyone they are close to. \n\nHe worked his ass off to start the organization. He formed it and began sending families to places like the outer banks and ocean city and other east coast beaches. A week before he died, he launched his first big month long fundraiser. He passed away knowing that he had raised enough to send like 10 families on respite weeks. It was like he was passing the baton off to others who could keep on fighting. The org is still going strong today. If anyone is blessed to have their health and a sweet vacation spot you’d like to donate for occasional use by sick people all coordinated by an awesome organization, I’d encourage you to reach out to the A Week Away folks.

Apparently, sloths are very nervous creatures, so it's a little tricky to actually hold one. \n\nI found a local company that does visits to schools and whatnot who had a sloth. Sloths only poop about once a week and the sloth could only travel the day after he pooped (because they get nervous, any longer than that and the sloth has stress diarrhea). So basically, we had to wait until the sloth pooped and then set up the visit for the next day. The sloth pooped on Thanksgiving, so we set up the visit for the next morning. The patient was able to hold and pet a very sweet sloth. The patient died about three weeks later, and I am very happy I was able to help give her some joy in her final weeks.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Wow, guys, I did not expect this to blow up! Thank you so much for the awards!\n\nThe hospice I worked at had a special program called Faithful Wishes for any of our patients, regardless of age. As the Volunteer Coordinator, fulfilling these wishes was part of my job. I do believe there are other non-profit organizations that grant wishes to adults, but nothing as large as Make-a-Wish.\n\nYes, the sloth was tame and lived in an animal preserve. He would also visit schools and retirement communities, schedule permitting. And yes, I absolutely learned more about sloth bowel movements than I ever wanted to 🤷‍♀️",

Her crater is much more vast than I imagined. There were active lava flows near the sea that were amazing at night. How mom drove back to the opposite side of the island after dark is also amazing to ponder. It was such an amazing time, saw so much of the island. However, the whale watching was cancelled. At least I got to snorkel on a reef and swim with a (captive)bottle nosed dolphin at the resort. I still remember the tiny sour red plums at the breakfast buffet. I am so glad to have seen the volcanos. It was awe inspiring. Very different than just the random dormant mountain volcanos in the background of places. Best family vacation ever. Thanks make-a-wish people, you made the end of my decade of treatments amazing. My mother was with me at all my appointments and held my hand every treatment, so doing my wish as a family was very important to me. I feel very fortunate to have had this experience and also, you know, still be alive. \n\nHope to visit Pompeii and Herculaneum, if I survive these plague times, and sing ‘Funiculi, Funicula’ while visiting Vesuvius.

I told her no, as much as I would love that, it was her wish, not mine.  I'm sure they would have found that a bit strange for a 5-y/o. Her 2nd  choice was a trip to Hawaii.  While that was more feasible, I knew it was super expensive and I knew something she would like more.  So I reminded her that she had been asking us to take her to a certain place for a while.  It took her a while to figure it out but finally landed on going to Disney World.  It was a great trip, totally amazing what they did for her and our family.  I know she doesn't remember a whole lot but we have been back several times since and returned to the \"Give the kids the World\" village for a visit, where they have the Make a wish families stay, so she could refresh her memory.  I still cry just thinking about what they do for these families. She'd only been done chemo for about 3 months when we went on the trip so she was still very fragile and got tired really easily, and had been hospitalized twice before the trip.  Luckily she was healthy enough to go on the trip though we made use of the free wheelchairs we were given for her use everywhere we went.  The Disney staff were great too as she wore a pin that they knew to look for and she got special treatment there too.  She made a full recovery though, recently graduated from college.",

Now my  wife was absolutely shocked.  She had worked there for years and seen the princesses and Mini/Mickey Mouse do hundreds of Make A Wishes, while the villains had never done a single one.  She thought today was her lucky day and she was going to be making a wish for the rare Cruella superfan (this was years ago before Cruella had her own movie and was popular).  \n\nNext my wife enters the private audience room , which she hadn’t even been in before and puts on her Cruella attitude.  Before she knows it she sees this diminutive teenage child being wheeled over who is pointing her finger and yelling.  As the child is wheeled closer my wife hears the child yelling, “your a creep!” Over and over again.  She tried to play it off saying all the standard Cruella lines and making jokes, but the kid just kept screaming “your a creep!!!”  While the family laughed and took photos.   Now the kid wasn’t 100% there mentally so my wife didn’t take it that hard.  But it was pretty hilarious and confusing for my wife.  \n\nTLDR: kids make a wish was to spend 15 minutes berating Cruella in person who just so happened to be my very confused wife.",

To compensate they asked us with less than 24 hours notice to send cosplayers to meet the girl at a hotel with her family. The hotel was decorated with palm trees and leis and all sorts of stuff, and our costumers did tricks and sang songs and talked with her even though she was non-verbal and basically paralyzed. At one point our Maui started spinning his hook around his wrist and the girl visibly smiled. Her mother later pulled me aside and told me it was the first time she'd seen her smile in weeks.

My GM had approached me the day prior, explaining that Make a Wish was actually going to be visiting the store to fulfill a child’s wish, and that he thought I’d be just the right person to help. He wanted me to help the wish recipient go on a shopping spree inside the store. If I remember correctly, even though make a wish was paying for it, I was told that we could throw a few things in ourselves (this was many years back, and unfortunately my memory is pretty terrible lol). \n\nI was pretty nervous all the next day, waiting for this moment where I could actually help make some child with some health issues’ day and make a difference. Then all of a sudden, they walked into the store, it wound up being someone I went to middle school with (I switched schools, and I think at the time I was either a senior in high school, or had just recently graduated). I was friendly with this person back then, but hadn’t talked to him in years. This definitely wasn’t the “small child” that I was expected, or that I had falsely thought that make a wish only helped small children, so I was completely caught off guard. I almost didn’t know what to do/how to react, as I knew I couldn’t ask what was wrong or know what he had going on, but it all was just so surreal for me. \n\nAfter a bit of awkwardness and me saying, “Hey, I know you!”, I did the best I could to help this old friend out, and give him the best damn time while shopping around the store. We chatted (he recognized me pretty quickly and knew who I was, and I remembered that he was into gaming - hence the shopping spree I suppose lol), and we chatted about college I think and gaming and such. It wasn’t a very extravagant or unique Make a Wish story, but it was unique to me. \n\nTrying to remember this experience, got me wondering, and it doesn’t look like he’s posted anything on Facebook in about two years.. I really hope he’s still around 😞",

There are three rooms at the Anna and Elsa meet and greet with three sets of actresses meeting guests at the same time, so it was easy to block off a room for a Make-A-Wish guest without shutting down the whole attraction. The MAW kids would be able to have the sisters’ undivided attention for however long they wanted to stay and play.\n\nLots of happy memories were made during those visits! I remember once a little girl stayed so long playing hide and seek with Anna and Elsa that I think the actresses got to go home early that day. They are only supposed to be in costume for an hour, tops, before they get a 30 minute break. (They’re not allowed to eat or drink on set.) They played with the little girl for almost 2 hours!\n\nI can remember another shy little girl, probably no older than 6 or 7, who was so starstruck by Anna and Elsa. They had a long conversation and Elsa asked her if she had any special powers, like Elsa’s ice powers. The little girl paused to think for a long time and said, “Well…. Is being nice to people a super power? My mommy and the doctors say that I am good at kindness.”\n\nThere wasn’t a dry eye in that room. I think Anna made a big show of looking around for Olaf so she would be able to turn away and compose herself.",
