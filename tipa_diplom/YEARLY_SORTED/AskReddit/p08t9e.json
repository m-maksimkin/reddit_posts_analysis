You may know it as autochorissexual which is an older term we no longer use. It's a part of the asexuality spectrum.  \nNow every aego's experiences are different, of course. Personally, I can't find humans sexually attractive. I just can't. But I do find myself drawn to certain fictional characters...  \nand before you all bite my head off about bestiality, every character I'm attracted to fully passes [the Harkness test](https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/1b6coo/the_harkness_test/), so shut it.   \nWeirdest one is probably Grimm from Hollow Knight, since he's technically a bug. Although he's not a normal bug - he's the vessel for an ancient being called the Nightmare Heart who created him and uses him to perform a ritual to keep itself alive (hollow knight lore is complicated). anyway there's 20k comments already so hopefully nobody sees this",

I took a trip north to clear my mind and just reset before the busy fall months set in. \n \nGirl I've known for a few years lives there. It's not that this person is not attractive. But I hadn't really ever had thoughts about her or anything, she was always just a friend of a friend. Kind of unique in how quiet she was. And she was very comfortable just being alone in nature all time. Admired small things about the world. It all was fine. But at first it was weird to me a little and I never felt attracted to her. \n\nFast forward. I'm single in this small town and she reaches out to hang. Of course I say yes because we were friends. Guys. Let me tell you. \n\nThis girl is probably one of the nicest human beings on the planet. She is so beautiful. So fuckung SMART. MY GOD. clever. Caring. Compassionate. Altruistic. It made my heart hurt! Because we spent 5 days straight together and then I had to leave. \n\nShe honestly amazes me and I think about her every single day now. Hurts people. Hurts to not have her in my life. And it is crazy how much you can be attracted to someone for that. In my eyes. She is the one. I could so easily fall in love. I already have a little by accident haha. \n\nThat kind of person is rare. And it is so. Fucking. Hot. And so fucking admirable and attractive. \n\nPeace!",

I love pixie cuts, buzz cuts, bob cuts, bald ladies (if their head is suited to it.) Honestly, anything above the shoulder, I'm into.\n\n- Smiling genuinely. If I can tell that a smile is forced or prescripted, I'm not into it. But if something makes you laugh, or you see something that makes you happy, I'm smitten. \n\n- When women with long hair put it into a ponytail. Like, the action of reaching back to gather up their hair and pulling a hair tie off their wrist - in a totally non-sexual way, it means business, and I love when a woman needs to eliminate the distraction of their hair. \n\n- High ponytails, a la Ariana Grande. 'Nuff said. \n\n- Looking at three of the last four, apparently women's foreheads? I hate when people have bangs (EASILY my biggest turn off,) and obviously I'm into both short hair and long hair pulled away from the face. \n\n- Any attention paid to me by way of action. Someone cleans my dishes? Someone puts on a song because I like it? Someone prepares a dish because I want it? Even someone genuinely saying \"thank you\" - I'm smitten. \n\n- Literally any indication of underwear on the top of her clothes. Panty lines, tight shirts that show where the bra lies, no bra (hard nipples under a t-shirt are THE best,) any underwear color showing above the pants or through the shirt - any indication about underwear at all. \n\n- When ANY woman approaches me for anything. \"Hi, do you mind if we take this chair for our table?\" \"Excuse me sir, you're not allowed to smoke here.\" \"Hi, I'm Emily, I'll be your server tonight.\" Hi Emily, I'll be hoping we hit it off in the next 45 minutes and I leave here with your phone number. \n\n- When I make a special order at a restaurant and the woman giving me my food tells me exactly what's in the bag and what the special order was.\n\n- Servers who bring extra chips or breadsticks without being asked\n\n- Any female bartender. Period. \n\n- Virtually any woman under 40 in a two-piece bathing suit; most women under 40 in a one-piece, providing their shoulders are the widest point on their body; and thinnish women in any bathing suit of any age. Helen Mirren in a bikini would absolutely end me. Beyonce in any bathing suit would be burned into my mind forever. Christina Hendricks? Forget about it. \n\n- Any laughter with any kind of nasal involvement. Snorting, coughing, laughing by inhalation - it's all genuine enjoyment and I love it.",

Like, it's SO easy with my own breed of human.\n\nAnd most of them would also rather stay in and play music or video games than go to overwhelmingly brain-shutting-down places, too, like.\n\nPlus there's no pressure to mask.\n\nWe both say what we mean and mean what we say and understand it easily and don't misread non-existent hidden meanings into it and then get aggressive over nothing.\n\nWe are monotone and our monotone = neutral/positive, unless stated otherwise.\n\nAllistic people decide that a monotone ALWAYS MEANS THAT YOU MEAN THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AND SO IT'S TIME NOW TO HAVE AN ARGUMENT BECAUSE YOU COMPLIMENTED MY SHOES IN A RUDE AND SARCASTIC TONE TO GAIN MAKE-BELIEVE SOCIAL HIERARCHY OVER ME THAT ONLY EXISTS BECAUSE ALLISTIC PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED THAT IT DOES AND THIS NONSENSE IS MEANINGLESS TO AUTISTIC PEOPLE WHO DON'T VALUE PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR STATUS, AND YOU ARE RUDE AND MEAN AND WEIRD AND HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT YOU LIKE MY SHOES SO SARCASTICALLY EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T AND YOU DO LIKE MY SHOES BUT NOW YOU DON'T LIKE ME BECAUSE I'M BEING A FUCKING KAREN AND THE MORE THAT YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT I HAVE MISREAD YOU, THE MORE OFFENDED AND INSISTENT I WILL GET THAT YOU ARE LYING AND WE'RE BEING MEAN ALL ALONG BECAUSE ALLISTIC NEUROLOGICAL CULTURE IS FUELLED BY SHAME AND FEIGNING PERFECTION, IT'S LIKE A DIET VERSION NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER FOR A LOT OF US AND I CAN'T JUST SAY \"WHOOPS, I WAS MISTAKEN, MY BAD\" AND BE PEACEFUL LIKE A MATURE PERSON, I HAVE TO BE A STRESS MONSTER.\n\nAnd it's like that.\n\nSo yeah.\n\nI have Resting Bitchy Voice, like Daria, but the attitude of a (albeit, sweary) My Little Pony.\n\nAutistic and ADHD people use different muscles in our face to speak than non-ADHD Allistic people and it's emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting to us to put on a good customer service tone of voice to patronise and coddle Allistic people with, just so they don't scream at us about being rude when we weren't.\n\nIronically, being forced to mask and doing it is us being rude, in our minds, like, wow, I have to talk to this person like they're a baby otherwise they'll scream because they communicate almost exclusively by tone of voice and not by word definitions, whereas were the other way around, like.\n\nAnd if you don't look like the ableist caricature in their head of a cross-eyed, groaning, non-verbal, drooling person fuelled by Nazi ideology in WWII and STILL circulating throughout the medical community TO THIS DAY, they have the audacity to say \"You're not Autistic/You can't be Autistic.\"\n\nExcuse the fuck out of you, but plenty of us are incredibly attractive, and you don't get to dismiss our lifetime of trauma caused by your people's cruelty with your ignorance and privilege and magically make it reality, that's not how it fuckin' works.\n\nI get strangers tellin' me without prompt - men cross shops to talk to me - very exhausting trying to reject them without incurring their possibly misogynistic, bratty wrath!\n\nNot that I don't want good looking privilege, it's a good thing to have, but men be scary: especially Allistic men.\n\nYeah, gee, an attractive Autistic person?\n\nGod, it's almost like we're human or something and not all the same and like you should treat us with a basic level of human courtesy regardless of our appearance, or something.\n\nThat's called sarcasm.\n\nIt's not natural to us in our default settings, but we can learn it and use it well as a DLC from observing Allistic people doing it.\n\nI don't have the energy to give every Allistic person who interacts with me a TedTalk about Autistic people and so I have to say some other reason for not being interested in them when an Allistic man wants to be in a romantic and/or sexual relationship with me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like mellifluent, pretty, verbose, and musical Autistic men.\n\nLike, that's my type.\n\nLike 0.2% of people.\n\nWith rare exceptions.\n\nSome ADHD Allistic men are alright, but like, they don't rev my engine as intensely as my same neurotype does.\n\nPray for me to find these men, people!\n\nI'm so sexually frustrated in quarantine, and then even when the plague is finally, definitely over, it will still be difficult to find he's gents!\n\n(Like 1 to 2 in 48 people are Autistic, 10% of those people are geniuses, and something maybe like 20% have learning and motor control and speech difficulties, and then the rest of us are pretty average people - y'all never hear about us common types of Autistic people - the ableist documentaries are all about the 10% and the 20%.)\n\n[Allism Spectrum Disorders: A Parody.](https://neuroclastic.com/2018/09/23/allism-spectrum-disorders-a-parody/)\n\n[\"It's a Spectrum\" Doesn't Mean What You Think.](https://neuroclastic.com/2019/05/04/its-a-spectrum-doesnt-mean-what-you-think/)\n\n[They a little confused (outdated, ableist language), but they got the spirit!

It‚Äôs the embracing of the great joys of life, and a rejection of restraint.  When we snort-laugh, for one beautiful moment we‚Äôre not thinking about how we look, or worrying about the rules of beauty that linger constantly in the back of our heads even when we reject and try to fight them. We‚Äôre thinking only about whatever it was that made us laugh so hard, and for one shining instance, we are free. Seeing that in other women makes me feel like I‚Äôm getting a glimpse of who we could be all the time if we were free of the beauty myth and all of the sexist expectations placed on us, and my heart soars and I instantly find that woman so much more attractive because I‚Äôm getting a glimpse of her bright shining soul.",

Not teeth that are rotten or grossly out of shape. Specifically elongated eye teeth (not sharpened but natural), front teeth that lean towards the back of the mouth (again not in an extreme way but subtle). \n* Lips in one of a few very specific shapes that I can't explain without pictures. \n* Small breasts. \n* Narrow hips. \n* Blond hair but also any long and thick hair (including natural red). \n* Medium to pale skin on the one hand and on the other very very very dark skin of the type found on many African women. The ultimate fantasy is to be with both types together. \n\nI think it's also helpful to list what it is that I find incredibly unattractive so herewith another list:  \n\n\n* Any kind of plastic surgery that has been done for purely aesthetic purposes. I far prefer someone with flaws than with fixed flaws. \n* Unnaturally shaped feet from wearing ill fitting shoes. I'm not very keen on a dancers feet but I can appreciate them more than feet that have lived in stiletto's for the sake of being attractive. At least a dancer sacrificed her feet for a noble and beautiful cause. \n* Rude, obnoxious and unkind behavior at any time. \n* Ugliness towards others especially regarding body image and expectations. Everyone is beautiful in one way or another and body's of every kind need more credit than they are given. They also need more love than they are given. \n* Overly flirtatious and dominant personalities. While I very much enjoy risk taking I do not enjoy being forced into a situation that I have no control over. Be a little assertive, suggest something risky and work out how we do it together. If you force me I'm out and you will know it. \n\nMmmmmm.... I have over shared very much in this post but it's also a good thing for me as I'm working on sharing a bit more and lurking a bit less. I hope that some of you find my words interesting or at the very least amusing.",

Like, not an older woman who dresses or acts \"sexy,\" but just an older woman wearing semi-nice clothes. They have such an elegance and gentleness and sagacity about them. In fact, the first time I realized I was *really* into ladies was with a high school teacher. She was thirty-something years older than me and always wore these plain-looking blouses with long skirts and sweaters -- like the female equivalent of the tweed jacket-wearing college professor. One day I asked her a question and as she answered it I realized I was utterly smitten with her. And the other day I saw a lady who may have been in her 40s or 50s with this gorgeous blue dress and a fancy braid wrapped around her head. She was just so put-together and elegant-looking and she smiled at me and just-- ugghh if she asked me to jump off a cliff I'd do it, no questions asked.\n\nNot to go on a rant, but I hate the way we look down on aging women. Whenever I see an ad for anti-aging cream or makeup or whatever I want to punch a hole in the wall. Lines and wrinkles are shadows of your previous facial expressions! They show you can feel!

Well, here is a funny story. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I had a girlfriend in my college days 20 years back. She had this unique body scent about her which was extremely attractive to me and also it was soothing and calming for me etc etc. Things happened we moved, at some point I left my country and came to US. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne day, just driving by highway near my town, I suddenly feel that same scent and I suddenly felt like I was going to cry or something. Such a nostalgic smell. It was faint, like coming from far but it was in air. I wondered if there was some chemical factory nearby. It happened over next year or two when I kept feeling that smell around similar place on highway but then here and there and always loved it. Coincidentally, I was always by myself when this happened so I could not ever ask anyone else about what factory it was coming from.\n\nThen one day, it happened that I was driving with a friend and I felt that scent. I instantly asked my friend, what is this smell and where is this coming from? He made a weird face like how the f\\*\\*\\* you dont know this. This is a dead Skunk smell. He he :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo this date, I really love when I feel that skunk smell in air. No, I have never encountered the full intensity of it but I am talking about that low intensity one you find while driving nearby etc.. like the gasoline smell at the gas station. Back in my country, we dont have skunks (at least never heard of them), so there was nothing to associate that skunk smell is bad. Its interesting to think that we are actually \"trained\" to like and dislike smells from social perceptions most of the times. (jackfruit is another good example of this)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Had a girlfriend who smelled like skunk and now I love skunk smell :D :D",

Almost any time I see a guy and find him attractive I realise afterwards that he's short (ie under 5'7 or so). And if I find out a good looking guy is short it instantly makes him more attractive and if I find out he's tall slightly less. I'm not even good at gauging people's heights and am bad at telling if they're taller or shorter than me unless it's extreme and I don't think it's really about their height in relation to mine (I'm 5'5) or in relation to other people. I just find the look/proportions of shorter guys aesthetically pleasing.\n\nDidn't used to think there was anything remotely strange about this (just considered it the same as some girls preferring the look of tall guys) until I googled to see if other women agreed and it's crazy how rare it seems to be to actually prefer a shorter guy (or a guy around the same height as yourself) rather than to prefer taller or just not mind. Even when you do find an example it often involves a dominant/submissive or power thing, when to me it's not that at all it's just an attractiveness thing.\n\nBut yeah the weirdest thing about this to me is learning that apparently it can be considered weird.",

E.g. I may not know anything about sea turtles, but watching someone genuinely tell me why they fucking love sea turtles is just endearing. And generally I'm gonna want to get to know them more, because they have passion for a thing (not just endless facts, though those also have a place). \n\n2) \"Older\" women. Obviously people and not things, but since at least my late teens/ early 20s, women over 60 have been super attractive to me. I had a friend ask me once if I had an age cap, as they knew of my interest, and without a second thought I said \"whatever age Jane Fonda is\" and meant it. Still do. \n\nNot just physically (though definitely still that); but also mentally, emotionally, and intellectually. There's less bullshit, more honesty, cool stories, fun hobbies, solid self awareness and emotional range. Either they'll like me or not, we'll get on like gangbusters or like pickles and jam. I know each human is different and generalities suck, but...yeah. The whole package is my jam. Bonus fun if their hair is white, silver, or something funky like magenta and teal. \n\n3) Historical fashion. Take someone wearing whatever the latest seasons outfit is, and swap it for something from Spain in 1590, or Paris in 1897, and I am *riveted*. \n\nGive me women in 1920s cloche hats and men in 18th century waistcoats any day of the week. Send me non-binary people wearing whatever they wish from 17th century Netherlands. \n\nAll the colors and fabrics and textures and historical garments!

In order from most people to have it to least is women, gay men, men, then lesbians. The smell is stongest when someone starts a plant based diet, like new-year's-resolution-vegetarians, but then gets weaker as they continue their diet. The scent gets stonger as people loose weight, but weakens when they gain weight by muscle or fat. I had a friend with the scent, but it dissappeared as soon as they started taking heart medication.\n\nI don't know what the scent is, and I'm worried that I'm the only one looking for it.

I think it's because I had a really endearing teacher in school who stuttered, and it was just really cute. I find kilts very attractive. This probably isn't unusual, but to look at me I probably wouldn't strike most people as a kilt-lover. I'm really shy but I've managed to bring my awkward ass to compliment a few men on their kilts over the years and they always seemed pleasantly surprised. Oh, I love really dark-eyed gingers. People with light eyes and red hair are pretty too, just black-looking eyes, especially very large dark eyes, with red hair I rarely see and it's a really striking combo. I've had a couple Arab/part Arab friends that looked like this. Waardenburg Syndrome and heterochromia are really stunning. Moko kauae on Maori women has always been very attractive to me too. I don't know what it is, but I think it's gorgeous. The tradition is dying out but I think more people are trying to bring it back. There's probably more things but I never really know what's considered 'weird' until I bring it up and people act like it's strange to be attracted to a certain thing.",
