No water.\nBut lots of pit traps and gaps we had to jump over.\n\nSo we used this magical canoe to get over all of his traps that he had planned out. Get over the gap, deactivate it as we went, and tucked the boat in our pockets until we needed it again. Certainly saved my ass from falling into a few traps.\n\nHe also left us a circlet of teleportation, for us to use if we ran out of supplies/needed to return to the nearest city for any reason.

Each one protected its wearer from one form of damage, and some time ago, his rings had been taken from his priests.\n\nAs the god of death, he realized that this would be a terribly difficult mission and gave the party amulets that would return them to life at dawn of the next day, but that their power was limited. They could only return to life 10 times. \n\nI thought it clever, giving them a way to avoid permanent death, for a while. The threat is still there. More so because IF the amulets were removed before their resurrection, they wouldn't come back, but they were keyed to the party so each once would only work on its initial bearer.\n\nWell things went well for a while until an orphanage caught fire. I don't believe they started it, I think it was part of a raid, but one of the party decided to race into the orphanage to save people while the others didn't. A few failed rolls later and his character is dead. Which is slightly better than the rest of the party who is arrested for being a part of the raid (they weren't really but they didn't do well on proving their innocence either).\n\nSo, with sunrise the next day, the dwarf who died lifts himself from the burned wreckage of the orphanage, no one's around, but someone starts yelling at him. Not too far away is an ogre skull whose spirit has failed to move on and is just berating him for coming back to life when he worked so hard to make sure everyone died. I really, REALLY meant it just to be a neat little, \"oh, I can talk to ghosts now\" moment. Instead the little shit decides he's keeping his angry friend and dragging the skull along.\n\nCue the prison break adventure. I hadn't really planned too much for this, having someone punch a guard seemingly randomly, but now we had a guy on the outside. He made his way back to their room and raided the gear left in a hurry, nabbing a cloak of invisibility in the vein of Harry Potter where you must be under the cloak for it to work. He also collected a large amount of lamp oil.\n\nSo he gets to the prison and his master plan was to pour oil on the ogre skull, light it on fire and hold it over top of his cloaked body while screaming body murder and racing through the prison until he found them and broke them out. He succeeded.\n\nOver time each character died and soon they all could hear the skull talking, and they decided to bring him back to life one day, but until then he worked as a good means of dropping info the party missed or didn't think of without it feeling like I was just giving them stuff. Good times all around.\n\nEventually, after getting a magic boat that could sail on grass, they did manage to bring the ogre back to life. They stuck him in the crow's nest with a red shirt that was too tight and a white hat, just like Gilligan wore. Good times.",

Sure, why not.\n\nThe party consisted of an arcane trickster with underground connections, a stone oracle with tremor sense, a debuffing wizard, and a Shadowdancer bloodrager.\n\nSo there were reoccurring system of underground casinos in this kingdom. It doubled as a black market, and characters could buy/sell magic items that were more questionable there. It was a nice flavor to the setting and the arcane trickster has been making connections there since session 2 (we were over a year into the campaign). No one talks about them, but everyone knows they exist type of thing, think prohibition era speak-easy. However, anything that disturbs the peace is swiftly and severely punished using... extra-lawful methods. Any cheating in the casino, or any spells being cast at all, is promptly investigated by high level investigators and it was made clear that  they will most likely be caught.\n\nWell, they needed to kidnap to noblemen. They knew which casino they go to.\n\nChallenges: The staff (other than security) are forbidden from bringing ANYTHING of their own on the job, and are searched every hour at random times. There is a constant alarm in public areas, so any spell (magic, divine, or psionic) would be instantly detected. All items going in or out were searched and catalogued. There were anti-divination wards everywhere, and everywhere that was staff only were fully covered with anti-magic circles, anti-divination circles, anti-psionic circles, the whole deal. Servers would replace decks of cards periodically to prevent any sort of cheating, and all decks were examined before the servers could see them.\n\nArcane trickster volunteered to work at the casino as a dealer, and after showing off his dexterity and being a well known member of this particular community (it was the party's home base city). The shadow dancer was quite attractive and got a job as a server as his private security in case things went south and they needed to brute force their way out. They found that each room was independently warded, and that doorways actually stood between the anti-magic wards. The heist was on.\n\nThe stone oracle stone glided beneath the establishment and set up a cave beneath them. He could tremor sense and feel everything going on at the table our trickster was at. This was where he and the wizard were at. They also stashed the deck of cards in the alley next to the casino. At the beginning of the shift, our arcane trickster tapped the four corners of the table to help calibrate.\n\nOnce their targets entered, and eventually they played at his table. The shadowdancer went to replace his cards. She went to the back, got some of the pre-approved decks.  She moved the lamp to cast a shadow on the doorway. As she stepped through the doorway, she jumped to a shadow outside the casino, replaced the deck, and jumped, back into the doorway. He was now dealing with the magic 1d2 damage deck. Every time he dealt one of them, he would declare an attack on the table. Eventually, the table shook due to the 1d2 damage. This let the oracle know via tremmorsense where the nobles were. He earth glided up through the ground, and grabbed their ankles, pulling them through the stone into his layer where the wizard had spells prepared to blind, silence, and deafen them. The trickster threw the table over to 'help' them, announcing he was actually using it as a launcher for the cards to ranged attack the ground. All traces of magic left every card.\n\nThe heist was successful and they weren't caught. The authorities also couldn't tell where he was the night of the kidnapping, because of how taboo talking about the casinos is.",

The party, including my character, a 12th level multiclass Druid/Monk, was exploring the ruins surrounding an ancient citadel, sunk deep into the mountains of Halruaa in Faerun. This citadel belonged to the fallen civilization of Netheril, a society of incredibly powerful, evil wizards, who ruled over much of the continent many centuries ago. Their hunger for power got the better of them, and as one of their leaders began a ritual to claim divinity, they succeeded in destroying the fabric of reality through which all magic flowed, known as the Weave. Suddenly powerless, their floating citadels were scattered across the continent, and crashed into the ground. Eventually, magic returned to the world, but the empire would never again recover the power it once held.\n\nUntil *I* came along, that is.\n\nYou see, as a result of the downfall of Netheril, pockets of wild magic were present in and around the citadel we were exploring. Spells would backfire, have wildly increased effects, take the effect of another spell, all sorts of weird things would happen. As an example, the warlock in our party vomited up 10,000 copper pieces (twice), and his skin turned blue. The DM was using a random wild magic table he found online for these effects.\n\nSo my player found some runes inscribed on one of the walls of the ruins, and decided to cast Detect Magic (a 0th level spell in 3.5, aka a cantrip) while perusing. While concentrating on his spell, my character ended up walking straight into a pocket of wild magic, and there was a bright flash of light as my spell went haywire. I made a few percentile rolls, and our DM just started laughing. He called me over to his side of the screen, pointed out to me what I had rolled, and just got an immediate sinking feeling.\n\nThere were two effects from this case of wild magic. First off - I evaporated. The first effect was a Gaseous Form spell, targeted on myself, lasting for about 8 hours. This was harmless, and mostly just an annoyance, as my exploration was delayed.\n\nNext, the DM described as the ground began to split open and shake violently. Earthquakes were rolled to be starting in the surrounding 100 mile radius of mountainous countryside. And because of the specific pocket of wild magic I had wandered into, all numerical environmental effects were maximized. Meaning a 10 out of 10 on the Richter scale. MULTIPLE category 10 earthquakes were occurring. For how long? Well, that duration of 1d6 hours was also maximized, so 6 HOURS. Just a single Richter scale 10 is equivalent to about 123,000,000,000,000 pounds (123 trillion) of explosives going off. For scale, the largest explosion ever set off by humans was equivalent to a mere 114,000,000,000 pounds (114 billion) of explosives. These earthquakes were a thousand times stronger, and hundreds of them went off within a 100 mile radius of the citadel over the course of the next 6 hours. This effectively levelled the entire mountain range.\n\nThe DM continued to say how the ancient citadel slowly began to rise up into the sky, no longer impeded by the weight of the mountain. A thundering voice crashed over the sounds of the trembling earth, exclaiming Netheril's rule over the lands had begun anew. A doomsday event which could have been prevented was accelerated as a result of my character.\n\nSo what happened to the party? Well, the rest of them were able to escape into an extra-dimensional pocket plane until the earth calmed down. I however, was now a gas. Meaning I was completely immune to any damage the earthquake caused, but instead had to watch the spectacle of an apocalyptic event of my own doing unfolded before me.\n\nThousands perished in the aftermath. My animal companion, a beloved raptor-like dinosaur, was torn apart by the crushing earth. The dwarves who were excavating the citadel with us were almost immediately all killed. The countryside was completely levelled, and any buildings in the area were reduced to piles of rubble. The earthquakes themselves extended far beyond the 100 mile radius, as that's just where the epicenters were. The real range was close to about a 500 mile radius, meaning if the epicenter of one earthquake was in Kansas, it could be felt easily in both California and Tennessee. This was HUGE. The map of the continent would be forever changed because of me.\n\nAll because of a 0th level spell. The DM still hasn't calculated experience points for everything I accidentally murdered.",

            "text": "WHERE DO I EVEN BEGIN? The entirely useless item: A chair. A fucking ***chair***.  \nNow, a small disclaimer: This is not a story about *successful* exploitation. Instead it is a story about one player's staggering tenacity and the sheer, unrelenting number of attempts to exploit this most mundane of objects that, I feel, makes this story worth telling.\n\n**Here's the story:**  \nI have a Chaotic Nonsense player who, every Thursday night for four years, has attempted to exploit every single item, character, interaction or word choice that I make for his character's benefit.\n\nSo this player, who we'll call Gordon, is playing a Bugbear Echo Knight with the worst Russian accent you've ever heard. But Gordon doesn't *just* want to be an Echo Knight with 3,000 attacks per turn. Nay, he *also* wants to be a wizard and sorcerer and wild magic warlock trickster rogue who can bend time and space to his furry, thieving will.\n\nHe's known for saying such eloquent things as: \"I'm going to attach these deer antlers to this chair, and then carry it around on my back to rest on. The antlers are because it looks cool and... gives me advantage on nature/survival/animal handling checks?\" (No.)\n\nI have made it clear: this chair is a microbe just north of useless. It's sole purpose in the universe is to provide a shaky foundation for his character's 8 foot tall, hairy ass. Despite this proclamation from Thediem, he has carried this chair through thick and thin. The Chair has, despite aggressive rolls to determine its fate every time, survived combat with giant corrupted spiders, earth elementals, undead dragons and Nightwalkers, sand worms a la *Dune*, and the corrupted form of an ancient, undying titan in the Astral Sea... People, when I tell you that this chair will not die, I mean that this fucking chair **will. not. die**.\n\nHere are the many ways in which Gordon has attempted to exploit the chair and everything else around it:\n\n* He has tried to use the chair to increase the speed of a short rest.\n* He has used the chair to carry companions AND then try to turn them invisible with him because he has a ring of invisibility.\n* He has asked the High Archon, magical advisor to a Dwarven king and incredibly powerful wizard to, and I quote \"Make it so when I sit in the chair I get a long rest.\"\n* He has added the chitinous carapace of the aforementioned sand worm to the chair to \"reinforce it and increase it's AC\". (Honestly, this was too funny to deny a +1 to The Chair's AC)\n* He has attacked spiders with it like a lion tamer and tried to infuse / combine it with every magical item you can think of.\n\nNow, our current campaign is nowhere near done. We've got another year or two of The Chair at least. Here's my prediction for what's going to happen with this chair:\n\nThe shenanigans will continue. The armoring, the enchanting, the experimentation, the \"Can I use this chair to gain advantage on my stealth check because other chairs exist in the universe\"... will all happen week after week, over and over. And somehow, somewhere, some way, I'm going to make a mistake and give it a trait, a feature, an element of lore whose ramifications will haunt me. (If I haven't already)\n\nThat Chair is going to be the thing that saves the entire party from a TPK. It's going to baffle the BBEG. It's going to stop the Tarrasque. I don't know, something awful. But whether due to the constant exposure to random magic, like some Irradiated Arcane Chair of Madness, or the completely unnecessary layers of armor applied to its exterior, this chair is going to save the goddamn world.\n\nAnd I'm going to both hate and love it.\n\n(Disclaimer: I love this player, despite how much of a pain in my ass he is lol. I don't need DM advice for handling him. We've got it covered. 4 years running and it's going great. Thank you in advance <3)",

For those who don't know it, it revolves around alternate versions of Earth where something is fundamentally wrong and the player characters are able to travel between these worlds, having been gifted with psychokinetic abilities. \n\nI was (I believe) a Pusher, so I could accelerate things beyond their normal speeds. Bullets would travel out of my guns at double or triple the velocity, doing tons of damage. I was our group's driver, playing a Jason Statham \"Transporter\" type character. \n\nFirst mission of the campaign we were sent to a version of Earth called Icebox, where humans messed around with the climate and created a new Ice Age. We had to head to a research outpost of some kind to check on operatives we sent in, and we took modified Snowcats that had trailers to deliver supplies along the way. The driver of the Rig, a nice guy named Jensen, got to know my character pretty well on the drive. \n\nAbout a day into our trip our Snowcat got attacked by bandits on snowmobiles. Due to bad luck, my guns fell out of the cab while my party members were fighting from the back trailer, shooting at the bandits. I asked our DM if I could search the cab for another weapon. I rolled really poorly, so instead of a gun, I looked in the glove box of the cab and found a flare gun. Seeing as how it was the only weapon I had left, I decided I'd use my powers to shoot the flare out at one of the bandits. I rolled a critical hit and the flare accelerated like a grenade launcher at one bandit pair on a snowmobile and they completely exploded in a huge fireball. \n\nEveryone was dying that I killed these bandits with a flare gun, we could not stop laughing at all lol. So I'm like \"I've got the rest of these guys, team\" and proceed to shoot out the rest of the bandits with the flare gun. I lit two of the snowmobiles on fire and outright killed a few others. Along the way though, a stray bullet had hit our driver, my buddy Jensen, and he died. \n\nI took the flare gun with me on our adventures from then on, scratched his name into the flare gun, and named it Jensen in his honor. I went on to shoot down helicopters, burn nightmarish mutant bears, blow up nanobot zombies... it ended up being the best weapon in the party for our campaign.",

They all immediately latched onto the idea that the box *must* signify something/lead somewhere/hide something. It doesn't. There is literally no end game there. Its the biggest red herring that I ever made and they keep stumbling into other adventures because of it. The puzzlebox has featured in several campaigns across several of the 40k FFG RPGs and nobody has caught on.\n\nThe exploit is that *somehow* they constantly keep retrofitting what the box says into the various campaigns, which leads them down actual paths of investigations.

It was a higher level than the PCs, so the idea was that they would need to flee every encounter and take measures to avoid being followed; having someone on their tail constantly tracking them that could and would actually kill them was supposed to inject a sense of urgency into the game.\n>\n>On the first encounter, the werewolf was shown methodically slaying a large group of town guards and a high-ranking paladin. The characters were around level 5 or so, the NPC was probably CR 12 and would scale as they leveled. They interrupted the combat, and the idea was that they would attempt to fight the werewolf (who didn't consider them a threat initially, and so wouldn't just murder the whole party), see it killing a high-level character, and go \"Oh shit, we need to run from it\" while it slaughtered the rest of the guards.\n>\n>So at first, they rush in to help and attack the werewolf, doing little damage because they don't have silver weapons and I gave this particular NPC a regeneration ability only stopped by silver. I have the werewolf attack one of the players with a secondary bite attack, which should put them to fairly low health without killing them outright.\n>\n>That player pauses for a moment, and then asks if he can try to block the attack with his hand. I'm not sure what he's getting at, but I humor him and say he can do that with a DC 10 Dexterity check, although it won't affect what kind of damage he takes. He succeeds. He then asks if he can jam his hand into the werewolf's mouth. I say... sure, but he's probably going to bite it off, and you'll need a new hand. He says \"Even better.\"\n>\n>I describe the werewolf doing so. The rest of combat continues until the player's turn, who seems undisturbed by the loss of a hand, and on his turn he says \"I activate Quaal's feather token to make a tree.\"\n>\n>This token is a magic one-time use item that creates a 5 foot diameter, 40 foot high tree. It's a handy utility item that our playgroup was fond of- previously we'd used it to do things from just making bridges and crossing walls, to providing a druid with a way to use a particular spell in plant-less areas that require trees. It didn't seem to have much use here.\n>\n>I ask him where on the board he's activating it. He points at the werewolf. I say that the most that's going to do is knock the werewolf prone, and he gets a fairly easy save to prevent that. He smiles. \"No, it's in the werewolf.\"\n>\n>\"What? How?\"\n>\n>\"I was holding it when he ate my hand.\"\n>\n>Me and the rest of the party are kind of silent for a second. I'm trying to think of a valid reason why this won't work. I fail. The werewolf now has a five foot wide tree growing out of him. The fact that he has regeneration doesn't particularly help when little bits of him are plastered on walls twenty feet away.\n>\n>The entire party celebrated and they got a reward from the town and an ally in the paladin who was supposed to be dead.\n>\n>I had to make a new NPC.\n>\n>Clever players are awesome.",

Not wanting to tpk, and with the boss in surprisingly worse shape than I expected, I have him taunt the Barbarian and start to fly away.\n\n\"Brock is going to take his attack\" the barbarian says, throwing his pet with all his might.\n\nCrit, max damage on the roll, boss drops to -1 hitpoints and faceplants at the Barbarian's feet for the coup de gras, also performed by Brock to \"finish what he started.\"\n\nAnd that's how our party's pet rock gained a temporary flight speed of 40 feet, and \"favored enemy: verbose sorcerers.\"",

The Blast Scepter was sort of like a buffed wand of fireballs, but also gave the wearer resistance to both explosive damage and fire resistance.

It is now an inside joke.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe seagull's corpse was obtained during the very first session (we had only new players and they were toying around with the world; it was still the most random act I've ever seen happen) and used during the second (I asked them what they wanted to do and they wanted a classic dungeon crawl, so I designed a very stereotypical crypt sort of thing), to more or less circumvent my first custom bossfight. Basically, it was a door with a bowl and a knife in front of it. There was also some writing on it, but noone could read it (basically a failsafe, should they not immediately understand what was going on; the wizard knew \"comprehend languages\").  \nAnyway, they immediately understood they needed to fill the bowl with blood to open the door, and the druid was about to just take that one HP of damage, because who cares. The wizard stopped the others though, saying: \"Ah, nono, wait a moment. I've got blood on me, just a sec. - \\[I pull out the corpse of the seagull I got last time.\\]\" - I had completely forgotten about it, and just planted my head on the table. \"Aight.\"  \nNow, the plan was for one of the players to offer their blood, which would then open the door. Afterwards, they'd find themselves in a room with a sarcophagus on some sort of elevation. As soon as they fully entered the room, the doors would fly shut and the sarcophagus open, with whoever offered their blood coming out of it (an empowered version of that, anyway).  \nApparently, the wizard immediately knew what I was going to do (with the other two not expecting that kind of boss) and even apologized to me; she didn't know \"\"\"derailing\"\"\" or simply cheesing bosses was very much part of the whole game.Anyroad, I thought about what exactly to do, but decided to just use the same mechanics I would've used for the players, as it was the most funny and practical solution to me. The seagull actually went first in initiative and managed to hit the Druid quite badly (I think it was a crit, but I don't actually remember), but the wizard just completely annihilated it.  \nMy other ideas were to either just not let it work with non-humanoid blood (which I immediately disposed of, because that's no fun) or to make it some large gull-esque abomination, but I was very inexperienced as a DM and I wasn't sure if I could balance that on the fly. Would've been the best solution, probably.  \n\n\nThere was also a broken wall somewhere in the crypt though, with a small natural cave thing adjacent.

Now I also need to preface this with the fact that I have a custom house rule called Bonus point that I took on and modified from my brother. A bonus point can be earned by doing something really cool and smart or just hilarious that makes us all laugh, but it can be used to add a d6 to ANY role ore to impose disadvantage on me as the DM for any roll. \n\nNow that that is out of the way I can get on with the story. This particular time my party (lvl 12 at the time) decided they wanted to get involved in some high level political espionage and try and prevent a large scale battle before it began, so they snuck into the camp of this invasion force (did pretty well for having a Paladin in full plate) and managed to get to the quartermasters tent where all the food was. Now a long time prior when the party began I gave them a random potion that they never had identified but they found it in a cave so they kept it.\n\nSo without having previously planned what they were going to do in the camp, they chose to find the food and pour in this random potion. This potion was a random coughing potion when injested you have to make a con save and if you fail you start uncontrollably coughing until you pass out or can make your save, but you can't breathe right during this time.\n\nI made the roll and one of my players goes \"did you just roll something?\", \"Whatever roll with disadvantage\". So I did and I rolled a freaking 1. So this entire force at dinner starts to cough until they pass out.\n\nA potion designed to trick them into drinking it in a bind, ended up solving a large political squabble. I was dead.

Internally I reasoned that the gem must be indestructible or the curse would be too easily subverted, so I thought it would illustrate this point well to have the stones crack under his blows. Of course the player reasoned that if he could crack stones with a few blows of his fist, what he had was not a cursed gem that prevented him holding a sword but actually an extremely powerful club permanently affixed to his body, or at least, an extremely effective battering ram if it only affected inanimate objects. At that point I just said screw it and let him have it so we could move on with the session. He had to fight with his off hand, but any locked door? Shattered to splinters with a single blow.",

He’s a fast talking pin stripe suit and boater hat wearing salesman with a transatlantic accent.  He sells for Pinnacle Magic Items.  Every item is intended to be a total dud and force the players to get creative.  \n\nCosts are based entirely on a d100 roll.  So, party got lightning proof armor for <600 GP.  It was plate mail with a faraday cage in copper all over it.  To be lightning proof you had to drive at least one of two copper spikes into the ground.  Took a full action to sink one or pull it up.  Each spike was connected to the boots of the armor giving you very limited movement when you were lightning proof.  Party bought the armor, then cut all the copper crap off.  No longer lightning proof, but some very affordable plate armor for the fighter/tank.  \n\nI think my favorite was the scroll of C Harm person.  Hand written on a scroll of notebook paper.  Party did not pick up on the capitalization.  Thought they’d cast charm person, the somatic component on the inside of the scroll read “top of the bell curve.”  The caster did a rough mean of their damage through the session to the target.  C Harm person is a C average harm to the person.  \n\nThe wizard who had just learned fireball cast it.  It was bad.

            "text": "I was the player in this scenario. We were attempting to scale the outside of a tower to toss some magic item into a portal to the Plane of Destruction at the top. The tower belonged to a wizard, so of course had no doors or windows. There was a moderately powerful mage that had been harassing us for several sessions trying to get the item, and he had a gorecrow as a familiar (think raven but a bird of prey). I had an actual penalty to climbing, so I was hanging out on the ground \"keeping watch\" (read: eating lunch) when I saw the gorecrow flying near the top of the tower. I didn't have any weapons that could reach that far, and I wasn't a spellcaster, but I was stupid enough to try some dumb shit. I pulled out my hand mirror and tried to flash the gorecrow. They have bright light sensitivity, so when I managed to flash it, it was blinded for one round. One round was just long enough for it to miss a party member and fly into the portal, where it was destroyed. Fun fact about familiars, their death causes the caster to lose a spell slot of their highest level, take 1d4 Wisdom damage, and LOSE CONCENTRATION OF ANY ACTIVE SPELLS. If you were, say, invisible and flying, now you're not. Which is exactly what happened to the mage who was following us. He was 200 feet in the air, which translates to 20d6 of damage, averaging to 70. Spellcasters with a d4 hit die don't break 70 hit points (on average) until level 17, and the average hit points for a d4 hit die at level 20 is only 82. So a level 7 spellcaster, with an average of 30 hp, is almost certainly going to die from that fall, and even a level 20 spellcaster could die from a 200 foot fall if they were a little unlucky. Needless to say, he died and we carried on. And that's the story of the time that a level 2 character with an NPC class killed a level 7 spellcaster with a mundane item.",

But other times they were quite useful, for example, one rat they fed to a yuan-ti, and made him laugh whilst he was chewing him, the npc failed his con save and I let it count as an instant kill from choking to death.\n\nHowever, the bag has turned into a huge plot point. One of the players formed a hatred of the giant rat who makes all of the rules (from this video https://youtu.be/OXQwx1EolD8), and they would fight, he would throw it as far as he could, and in every occasionally session I would have the rat appear in random places or he would accidentally roll a 19 when using the bag of rats and summon him.\n\nI’ve decided that because of these dimension crossing abilities, the giant rat who makes all of the rules really should make all of the rules, and once they defeat the big bad, they meet the giant rat in his true form, a great celestial god",

I had everyone create a character (focused on personalities: likes, dislikes, fears, etc) and when I got to my dad, he said \"I'm a rock.\" I asked his name, and he said, \"I don't have a name. I'm just a rock.\" He couldn't talk, and there wasn't anything special about him. He was just a rock.

Dad's rock was far more valuable. You see, the quest I gave them involved recovering a stolen ring that a tribe of goblins had stolen from a giant. (The goblin king was wearing it as a crown.) My family fought their way through the guards and into the main hall to confront the goblin king. They barged in to find themselves surrounded by goblins, who were startled for a moment, but quickly started reaching for weapons. My brother held the rock high and announced that he had a magical rock that would destroy their whole tribe if they didn't give back the ring/crown. After a moment of hesitation, the goblins decided \"That's just an ordinary rock. You're bluffing!\" and moved to attack. At this point, my mom pulled out a magic wand (she had a bag of them with random effects) and cast a spell on the rock. By chance, this spell turned the rock into, effectively, a shiny disco ball. The next wand she pulled out made exploding sound effects. The goblins were astonished, and in the end, my family agreed to trade their \"magic\" rock for the giant's ring and the goodwill of the goblins. \n\nSo even though he refused to play, my dad was the hero.",

Like a comb that always untangles hair, a hankie that cures seasonal allergies, magic boots that prevent all foot ailments, or a diaper that changes all fecal matter to air and a puff of talcum powder?  Then the adventurers would usually resell them or use them in trades.\n\nThe diaper came in handy for a trade with some kobolds.\n\nBut one I didn't think of, \"the bowl of neverending spaghetti.\" Just a normal bowl, and when taken out, it will always have nice, hot spaghetti and a delicious tangy sauce.  Well, in an attempt to be annoying with one player who was hoarding magical items, I made it so that the bowl always has to be kept upright.  Otherwise, spaghetti would keep falling out and self-generating: filling his backpack, ruining scrolls and maps, and so on.  Well, then he put it in his portable hole, and there was an argument about just how much space was IN a portable hole.   We settled on whatever, but he got a bit salty about it, and reversed the \"just continually pours out unless upright,\" by \\*holding it upside-down over open pit traps\\* until they filled. Or made a pile of spaghetti to cushion the fall after a large jump (like off a ledge). After an argument about how hot the spaghetti was (\"can we burn an owlbear?\"), I managed to have it stolen by a very angry, high-level kuo-toan priest who created the magical item who was tracking the party and suddenly appeared: demanding to be paid for all the pasta they had been consuming.

I think the jar was later used to conceal some of the PCs and transport them through part of a dungeon for some reason I don't remember.\n\nNow for context, the tundra they're in was made when the goddess of winter's daughter was killed and she created a set of magical weapons which act like nukes and used them to destroy the civilisation which used to be there. A side quest the PCs went on was to retrieve two of these weapons from an ancient crypt so when they found them they put them in the jar. After some shenanigans involving the destruction of a city (for like the second time in this campaign) they left with one of the weapons and later used it to kill an embodiment of pure chaos.\n\nSo yeah, the jar was already kind of powerful and I anticipated that it would be used in a few ways but not to carry around a nuclear weapon!

One card would summon a 4th level fighter to help the group so I rolled a d% on a table I made with fighters that matched the description and it landed on \"Diseased Fighter\". This NPC was canonically braindead to an extent, think of him as a special needs character. They named him Opie. \n\nOpie tagged along with the group, tied to a rope. This NPC would wander off if they didn't watch him while they did their own thing and he would get into shenanigans like entering a tavern and causing a huge scene, much to the dismay of the townsfolk who blamed the party for bringing him to town. Opie tagged along in the campaign for a good 6 months until the group came upon an old tavern in a remote village. The party would soon get distracted as a fight broke out nearby the tavern, and Opie would make his escape out of fear and hide nearby unbeknownst to the party.\n\nAfter the scuffle, the players found a dark secret hidden below the tavern foundation - an old amber prison that housed a centuries old lich. One of my players, being a Paladin, just wants to smash the evil thing, so he proceeds to clobber the amber and crack it apart, freeing the lich. I described this as a cold dark shadow fleeing the room immediately. Shortly after, the party notices Opie acting strange and confronts him, causing him to lash out and run away via spider walking on the ceiling and screeching, exiting the area.\n\nThe party would go another 6 months or so with no sign or mention of Opie. I decided it was at this time I was going to pull the campaign to a hard left for fun if I had my opportunity - and I did. I had a loose knowledge on how a lich worked, but I assumed if the lich regenerated and didn't have a new body, he would find a compatible one to link with. During this time my party had decided to explore a very trapped tomb in search of riches. This unfortunately killed the party via traps and engagements due to very poor rolls on their part and mine behind the screen. Normally I would fudge some things to keep them from TPK but I decided to let it go this time.\n\nAt the end of the session, I asked the players to hand me their character sheets and not bother with new ones. They all were sort of confused but agreed to it and after they left, I modified all of their sheets to undead counterparts with necessary changes being made as a result. The next session, their characters rose from their graves a few years later as undead thralls to the new lich - Lich Opie.\n\nThat is the story of how a Diseased Fighter with brain damage became an almighty lich and subjected the world to war and suffrage.",

I rushed the goblins with my party behind me and after we killed them, I rolled it up and carried it with me like a club. \n\nWhen I was split up from my party and didn't want to fight, I hid behind it while sneaking by some particularly stupid guards. I failed my sneak but I was able to convince them I was just a talking rug and I got back to my party unscathed.\n\nLater I got it appraised by a dwarven historian,  and it turns out, this really dusty rug was woven of mithril fibers and was an exceptionally lucky find.  You're damn right I carried that thing with me throughout the entire campaign!\n\nIn the end, it was used to block water from draining out of a room in which we were fighting a fire elemental by covering the drain. What was supposed to be a tricky fight kiting the elemental into shallow pools and gradually weakening it, became \"the elemental drops into the room full of chest-high water and dies in an explosion of steam. Everyone rolls a 2d-12  for damage minus your distance in feet from the elemental\"",

            "text": "Today is another chance to post the glory of 5RLP.\n\nIt is not a question of what I gave the party, but who I gave to the party. \n\nI’m currently running two groups in the same universe that starts out with a terrorist attack by some goblins in a university town, as a distraction for the BBEG to sneak in and take a bunch of powerful items for nefarious purposes. For session 0, I made one of the groups play as the goblins blowing up a wall to ease everyone in to the mechanics and rules. \n\nI read somewhere the idea that goblins take their name from a feat they have done and received recognition for, otherwise they have either a number or a guttural grunt or something for a name. I thought I’d have fun with it, so I gave them awesome names: Bloodchoke Gutshank, Really Large Hat, Too Many Knives and the hero of this story Five Rather Large Potatoes In His Mouth At One Time (5RLP for short). His back story was that he was a goblin assassin, who was so good at assassinating his foes that he wasn’t even known for it, because no one lived through his attempts. What he was in fact known for amongst his clan was (you guessed it) fitting five rather large potatoes in his mouth at one time. \n\nSo they play as the goblins, successfully blow up the wall and that was it for session zero. \n\nFor the next session, they played as their characters, and are first on the scene to crush the goblin scum. They don’t realize it at first, but eventually it dawns on them. The giveaway was actually Really Large Hat, who in fact, had a really large hat, and got found out by the players. The realization dawns on their faces as they realize they are murdering the goblins they played last time, with three of the four goblins dead and bleeding. With only 5RLP left to dispatch, the party concocts a wildly hairbrained scheme to attempt to convert the goblin to the forces of good, and after an absolutely absurd set of rolls and a wee bit of Devine intervention from the paladins god, they pull that shit off. \n\nSo now they’ve got this goblin following them around. He’s not feral, he’s actually fairly smart, and has just seen the love of a god for the first time (the god in universe of love and justice) and he’s smitten.\n\nI thought at first they would just bring him along on a quest and just forget about him, but boy was I wrong. They kitted this dude out. They play a protect the goblin comp when it gets down and dirty. They outfitted our resident warforged with a turret mounted crossbow on his back for 5RLP to sit in. They’ve brought him into major government meetings, they’ve brought him all over the world. 5RLP has met gods for chrissakes. He’s useless in combat, but they’ve turned this goblin into such a sweet and caring boy in the light of his goddess Solasta that he has become an absolute RP monster. He’s ascended to folklore status, to the point that the other group operating in a totally different part of the world HAS HEARD OF THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE GOBLIN 5RLP.\n\nSo they now have this goblin boy who now just loves life and has over the course of the year and a bit we’ve played become an absolute paragon of justice in game. He’s seen the world. He owns an inn now, he has his own school for those who want to repent and atone in the light of Solasta. He now has a range of hot dog carts that are spreading rapidly throughout the western kingdoms (aptly named 5 Rather Large Hotdogs in your Mouth At One Time For Less Than What You Would Expect 5 Hotdogs Purchased At Once to Cost You).

So the dress had been enchanted as a makeshift prison for gooses so that he could never escape. My goal as a character was only to kill this goose. Every goose that I collected into the dress eventually died of starvation or took a hit from a sword at some point and died, but not him. He would frequently poke me while i made attack rolls, or squawk when I tried to sneak just to screw me up, and I would stab him a couple times when he annoyed me. I discussed this with the dm and she knew 100% this was supposed to be for fun and I had no reason other than that for the handicap.

Honestly, his droid supremacist RP was actually really funny (\"You have a point....meatbag.\").\n\nHowever, in the context of party dynamics, it was really hard to trust him as he was mostly our ally of convenience. And so, upon visiting a nearby droid shop, the party face (and resident force sensitive) asked the GM if he could procure a restraining bolt, just in case he needs to use it on our resident murder droid.\n\nThe GM rolled his eyes and allowed it and we had a good laugh. There were some overtures to hide the existence of the restraining bolt from our murder droid. I think we had to spend some Fate points on it or something.\n\nThen, many, many, many sessions later (something on the scale of a couple months). Our GM had to move away soon, so we started a series of campaign ending games to uncover and confront the Imperial Mastermind that's been behind our woes.\n\nWhen we finally meet him, our force sensitive felt no life from him. It was then revealed that he was some sort of pseudo-clone super battle droid made to look like a human and we're about to have a big climactic battle.\n\n...Oh hey, GM, we have this restraining bolt. Can we use it on him?\n\n\"...I forgot about that.\" as he proceeds to face palm.\n\nOur force sensitive then use some mix of trickery and force powers to roll pretty well for attaching the restraining bolt.

I’m sure some rules were broken at several points. As a joke the DM gave me a satchel of “Bit-Coin” at the end of a session which were supposed to have no real value and weren’t accepted as currency anywhere. I only had it for the next session before he decided to nerf it. To mimic the unstableness of bit-coin, every day I would roll 5 D-20s and that would be the amount of bit-coins the pouch contained that session. I ended up rolling pretty high numbers. During that one session I used it constantly to trigger traps, often only using about 1-3 per trap. At one point, there was a room with a bottomless pit and invisible platforms and a time limit that we were supposed to traverse and it was supposed to be tense. I scattered 30 of them in a cone in front of me to figure out it where platforms where, and picked them up as we passed them, cleared the room easily and I still had like 20 left without using a single one of my spells for the day. The end of that session was a boss fight, and the DM planned to have it be that we were supposed to be unable to kill the boss, only survive for a bit before the boss figured out we weren’t actually enemies. The boss was immune to most magic and physical attacks. This was quite a few years ago so I don’t remember  how this spell works exactly, but one of my few spells was a motion activated explosive ward that I think took maybe a second or two after it was placed to become active. It was meant for trapping things to protect them, and could only be used on objects. I had to touch the object to place the ward on it. I used all three of my days spells on three bit coin, then threw them all at the boss, which caused them to go off directly on the boss. The boss was not immune to explosions. I rolled very high numbers that entire turn and they all went of and killed it instantly. The satchel was changed to not generate anymore bit-coin, and the spell was changed so that significantly moving the object the spell was placed on before it finished arming caused the spell to fail.

If I remember rightly they also found some way to make torpedoes with exploding skeletons too, but I don't remember exactly how that one worked\n\nHe also came up with a homebrew race of magical spirits, the name of which I don't remember. Either way they were bound to obey the orders of whoever owns them, and would always do exactly what you say. The downside of this is that they always do \\*exactly\\* what you say...in the most innaffectual way possible, as they generally weren't happy about their end of the bargain. As an example, tell them \"Throw these spears at the enemies!\" and they would stare you dead in the eye and start throwing them in the direction of the enemy, but sideways on.\n\nThese are only the ones I can remember off the top of my head, but hopefully you guys will enjoy them.",

We're still talking feywild shenanigans here, so they could have encountered anyone from ANY time period in my setting's history.\n\nFlash forward to the final confrontation with the hag. Most of the party is fighting for their lives in a toe-to-toe battle against the hag...all except my Ranger, who has taken it upon himself to ransack the hag's hovel and make a grand entrance at his leisure.\nAs the DM, I'm scratching my head, all but convinced this is simply bad form on his part, but he insists that I trust him as he pleads with me to let him continue with his sidebar shenanigans. I'm a little worried about him being the death of the other characters, but I know him well enough to know he would not be so deliberate in screwing his teammates.\n\nLong story short, Ranger charges in at dramatically clutch moment, PINS THE HAG to thr FLOOR with his bear animal companion, and FORCE-FEEDS her the pearl of lost souls.\nI'm stunned, the players are high-fiving each other, and the dice cooly nod in agreement.

For instance, to hit with a bow was a Dex roll below your Dex score. 20's were critical successes and 1's were critical failures.   \r  \n\n\nI wanted to play a pixie fairy, which was not one of the races he had in mind, but he agreed as long as we would alter my stats. He gave me a huge negative to my HP and Strength, but in return super boosted my Dex. I rolled my stats and assigned my points and ended up with a Strength of 4 and a Dex of 23. This meant I could not miss a shot unless I rolled a 1. \r  \n\n\nHe then asked what weapon I wanted to use, and I said something ranged like maybe a blowgun. Since I couldn’t miss my shots we agreed that instead of doing damage my darts would have a series of random comical effects: itching, explosive diarrhea, sleepiness, sexual attraction, blindness, etc. \n\n\r  \nThe game begins and our goal is to defend a castle from a coming threat of an Orc army. The Orcs brought two giant T-Rex's and the leader of the Orcs was riding a sabertooth tiger. We hear a war horn and see the orc army charging across the field, their leader galloping full speed atop his mount. With my high Dex I got to go first:\r  \n\r  \nMe: I fire an explosive diarrhea dart at the sabertooth tiger the Orc leader is riding. \r  \nDM: OK...?\r  \nMe: If the Orc leader was riding a horse, then it could run and poop at the same time. Unfortunately for him, cats cannot. \r  \nDM: Oh...Oh! Ok, so the tiger abruptly stops running (rolls a dice), throwing off his rider due to the sudden stop. The orc leader lands on the ground and (rolls another dice, crit failure) bashes his head on a rock and dies. \r  \n\n\nThis was just the start of the shenanigans for that game session. Front line Orcs were blinded and trampled to death. Orcs trying to scale the tower were put to sleep and fell to their demise. At one point I made one of the T-Rex's itchy (thus angry) and another one sexually turned on. Needless to say, that didn’t end well for either of them and took both of the largest threats off of the board. By the end of the game, my tiny pixie fairy with no damage dealing weapon ended up killing more enemies on the battlefield than any other player.",

The INTENT was that we'd go on an epic journey, and in the final stages come back to open our chests, assuming we'd earned our rightful place as 'heroes of legend'.   \n\n\nI'll admit I started it, when I asked if my barbarian could lift their chest and carry it... but when the DM said we wouldn't be able to find a lockpick for a chest with no lock, I gave up on that line of thinking.   \n\n\nMy half-orc friend on the other hand took that idea and ran with it. Using a length of hempen rope, he tied the chest around his waist to drag behind him like a big ridiculous hobble... which he then proceeded to use as a flail-type weapon at every opportunity. Thing is... he kept rolling 20s. The DM was making him roll for strength and pretty much anything else at every opportunity, trying to get control of the madness that was this massive chest just bashing along behind this half-orc like an out of control wrecking ball. There was nothing that could be done... while the rest of us were playing a fairly standard storyline, the halforc decided to 'go on ahead'.  \n\n\nThe half-orc entered a tavern (without picking up the chest, so it just knocked over tables, people, chairs, you name it...), ended up talking to the NPC that was going to set us on our journey, and somehow in the courses of this conversation ends up \\*accidentally\\* killing the NPC. With the chest. Seriously (while trying to be fancy while pulling the chest onto the table, he ended up rolling... you guessed it... another 20). This ended up causing a bit of a ruckus, as you can imagine, and the whole thing ended in an epic barfight-turned-streetbrawl. Guards were called, and while he put up an impressive fight, the half-orc was eventually subdued into several small pieces.   \n\n\nLike a shooting star, his rise and fall was a glorious blaze of incomprehensible luck and unpredictable aggression.

Some players in our group were already notorious for trying to exploit everything we interacted with in any way we could in other campaigns. Things like baiting monsters into their own traps or advanced things like using a bag of holding and portable hole set up on a special apparatus that, when fired with a ballista, would trigger a wormhole on impact. Our DM was already wise to these shenanigans when we started. \n\nSo during our new campaign as low level characters we were exploring a Dungeon as you’d expect. We came into the dining room of some goblins and were low on resources at this point, with a goblin horde close behind us. We asked if there was anything in the room. Already aggravated with our shenanigans my brother (DM) said “there is a large dining table. That’s it, there is nothing else in the room.” \n\nWe of course asked how it could be a dining room if it was 4 walls and a table, but that didn’t really matter. Before long though we knew we were in trouble as the goblins were at the door, so we did what any group would and flipped the table over for cover. This 10 foot by 4 table was evidently quite thick and durable and we used it like a wall and fought off all the goblins that came to attack, since giving our entire group a cover bonus was very useful for battle. \n\nNow this strategy worked so well, we carried the table with us throughout the whole rest of the dungeon and even beyond. Battle after battle having essentially movable cover was exceedingly useful. We would go on to enchant the table with permanent ironwood spell, (this was back in 3rd edition with the broken permanency spell) added adamantine reinforcements to the edges and legs, as well as steel handles in various places on the underside to grip it easier. We’d even use it for its original purpose when we were taking a long rest, and had a custom cart built that had the same dimensions as the table so that we could attach them in the corners and use the table as a roof of our cart. \n\nOriginally we had used it out of spite, but the table soon became a character of its own in a way. We ended up pouring way too much of our gold into that table and it’s upgrades, but our DM ran with it because honestly it was so much fun. And it all came from just a boring mundane Dining room table.",

I disguised myself as a waiter, but in that moment realized what I wanted to actually do. I positioned myself between the two characters with a serving tray, on the tray was a pouch.

He was dying and a little out of it so before he could say yes I started surgery and gave him Rock- it launcher arms. Since they were proportional to his anatomical size they could launch really big items so it mainly was meant to launch ( grenades, rail spikes, scrap metal, cans or anything around that size). Since heat was used to create pressure to launch the items I also created a compartment that made popcorn. The whole time he had the arm upgrade…. he used it to launch the dicks… yup dicks… he would scavenge the dead bodies of any Raider we killed and would launch dicks at any other Raider we would encounter. So it was pretty useless. The one exploit he did use it for has ranged healing. Since there was no magic or ranged healing options for the party our DM allowed him to place stimpacks in the luncher depending on where he would aim we still took some damage but the healing we would get was definitely worth the painful experience.",

The item in question was a magically reinforced metal can with a lid that screwed on. They then chucked a hunk of troll meat into the can. The rules for troll meat at the time allowed chunks of it to regenerate into full-grown new trolls, it just took a long time. So what these players did, was when they camped for the night they would open the screw top and let the troll meat slowly regenerate and ooze basically out of the top of the can. Then they would take a dagger, slice it off clean, and throw it on the campfire to cook, nullifying its regeneration and providing the party with an endless supply of hypothetically tasty troll meat patties whenever they were out of other food.",

His mother was a half orc and was knocked up by a dwarf from a campaign we had years prior. Mother raised him in the woods and he was nothing like a traditional dwarf. Anyways in the current campaign I stumbled across an axe and decided to keep it. The DM described it and it was a basic aged axe. I had an axe with similar stats already, so I decided I could sell it or barter for other items at a weapons shop on our next stop. I took the axe into the shop and the shop owner immediately offered me a very large sum of gold for it. My dwarf being non traditional and not crazy for money, thought this was odd and decided to keep it. We played for a few months after. Me using the axe occasionally. Then one session a perfect storm happened. Which the DM did not expect. But his Dm'ing style was to let what happens happen. We were in a cave and tripped a trap that sprayed a potion that turned friend into foe, vice versa. I failed my check miserably. Any ways as I'm fighting my team mates and them fighting the actual enemies. I rolled a crit. Then my damage which was 2d10. Then the dm made me roll a saving throw. I dont remember the specifics but I did a lot of rolling by my DMs request. He said \"fuck\" out loud. My axe struck the team mate I was fighting and vaporized him and half my other teammates died. Like dead dead. The axe did damage, then a shockwave did more which I rolled damage for as well. It was a mess. Turns out he had planned for us to find the axe when we were at a higher level, to fight bigger monsters. Which is why he tried buying it back. When he couldn't he put in a specific prerequisite I would have to roll. Like exact numbers. And I did. We were all lower level so our HP weren't crazy high. The PC I killed was my best friend in game. We had become close. It was terrible. We salvaged the campaign. But the DM couldnt find an exact way to bring back my elven buddy. The axe was a OP axe weilded by some insane fighter, it was called The Axe of Chaos. And it lived up to it's name.",

Turns out it was still inhabited by doomsday preppers from the 1990's, who had formed their own weird little society of jazzercising mallrats.  Among the technology they had for long-term survival was some genetically-engineered livestock, including a pig/chicken hybrid that grew into a 10lb sphere of confused animal that tasted like bacon.\n\nThe team made a point of collecting a bunch of these on the way out.  They would show up later at the team's base, wandering around in random scenes for a gag.  It was a pretty funny animal, and I couldn't see any way for them to exploit it, so sure.  You guys have access to spherical chickens.  \n\n\\---\n\nLater in the campaign, the team is trying to bust some allies out of a high-tech jail for Mages.  Just before they arrived, a recurring villain, a Toxic Shaman named Purity, snuck in with her sidekick and dropped off a bucket of mind-controlling Toxic Spirits.  When the team starts trying to open the ~~bacta tanks~~ mage vats to save the powerful NPCs, the Toxic spirits take over and turn the rescue into a battle against the most powerful magical allies the team has faced.\n\nOur magic system was a little more X-Men than classic SR.  Several Shamans were throwing around their Totem's most dangerous attacks while a Hermetic turned reality into knots.  The team was barely holding their own, and I had one more card to play - the last mage who was still emerging from the tank.\n\nShe was part of a Hermetic House I was very excited about, *Ad Astra*, whose focus was on using magic to become super-Idols.  They were big on flashy, dramatic effects that looked great at a rock concert, but they were far from pushovers...  I finally had a reason to let one show off in combat.  She was going to combine a full-on Avatar-state power pose with arcing electricity attacks, which should turn the tide of the pitched battle and force my players to adapt.  \n\nAll she had to do was float dramatically out of the room with the vats and join the fight on the main floor.\n\nThe team's Rigger saw it coming, got above the door frame, waited for her moment and ...\n\ngod, years later this is still hard to say ...\n\nShe glued a spherical chicken to the Idol's face.  \n\n\nI mean, the audacity alone.  How may people can claim to have glued livestock to an RPG boss in the middle of a fight?  It's unprecedented.  It's unbelievable.  It's an achievement to be proud of.\n\n\"It's blocking her line of sight.\" \n\nThe implications hit me.  Spellcasting in Shadowrun is absolutely dependent on line-of-sight. With a...(sigh) spherical chicken glued to her face, there wouldn't be any Tesla party tricks.  Her grand entrance with the floating and the glowy eyes and Ad Astra finally getting a chance to shine...thwarted.  I tried to recover.\n\n\"She's being piloted by a Toxic Spirit, though, right?  So she should be able to target her spells astrally.\"  In Shadowrun, spirits are native to an Astral plane, the place of raw magic and pure life.  Mages could peer into the astral to see invisible spirits and the solid auras of living things.  A spirit could plausibly use Astral vision to target spells, right?  We can keep this going.\n\n\"The chicken is a living blindfold.\"\n\nThat was it.  The coup-de-gras on my little plan.  Living things were solid in the Astral;  By gluing a living, spherical chicken to my boss, they had eliminated line-of-sight in both planes.  The rest of the NPCs were subdued and the toxic spirits exorcised.  The *Ad Astra* mage's dignity never recovered.",

Shouldn't be too hard for a literal murder-hobo, a literal clown sorcerer barred from an ever increasing number of establishments, and the filthy, disease riddled dwarf ratter. A little over a week and two riots into the city, they're relaxing and the clown tries to put on a song and dance number in a square, ends up sprouting cabbages within 30ft of them. Seeing the moment to both advance their goal and get them in trouble with the law, I take this  literally, and the cabbages begin sprouting from walls, the ground, people's spinal cords, etc. I also give them the obviously cursed item named the Suspiciously Cabbage Shaped Emerald. While they do nothing with it, the sorcerer later loses control of their magic, again, and the emerald replaces their wild magic effect with sprouting more cabbages. This kills several more people and leads to the building burning down. The party, hitherto more interested in merely becoming corrupt cops pivots immediately to use this to cause chaos and destroy property before pooling their resources to become landsharks and enforcers, driving down land prices until they can muster enough sheer land to actually get a political foothold in the city and just be lazy and bad politicians, turning my political intrigue campaign into D&D Monopoly edition.  \n\n\nBut my favourite comes from hearsay from a friend of mine well known for taking RAW and just... abusing it, even accidentally. You see, he gave every character he played some quirk and tidy backstory. Usually, this quirk was something harmless and the backstory was mostly because back in the 3.5 days, Knowledge was related to a specific field you had to pencil in. It's also worth pointing out that in 3.5, if you weren't aware, you could allot points to particular skills. Now, this character was a War Domain cleric who made sure his faith's buildings of worship, where they existed, were Siege Certified. So he had a variety of knowledges such as: Siege Engineering, Engineering, Architecture, Mathematics, Navigation, Construction and you get the idea. If it related to building, he knew it. His quirk was, well... he liked rope. How much? Aside from his starting armour and weapon, everything else he replaced with rope. Loot? Sold it for rope. Gems? Rope. Rare magical items that would have been really useful to have? Rope. He did this every session for a little over six months.  \n\n\nEventually, the DM managed to get the entire party to hit a wall, or more specifically a pit. The floor was part of an elaborate trap and it dropped out from under them. It was designed in such a way to be 'humane' for back when the ruins were inhabited, and the switch made the floor unlock beneath them and drop several dozen feet quite suddenly, greatly injuring everyone involved. They couldn't climb up the supports because they couldn't grab the edge of the ring, and they couldn't see how far down the ground was. The only way out was with spider climbing or flying, effectively, and no one had either of those. So it seemed like the party would die.... except the Cleric, my friend, got a rock, cast light on it and threw it to the ground. The DM, surely trying to doom them, fills him in that he loses track of it before it hits the ground in the darkness below. He at least can hear it, however, clack and roll in the eerie quiet. Spurred on by this, the cleric follows up  with can he get a guesstimate of how far it went, based solely on the amount of seconds before noise. The DM makes him roll for it: Nat 20, so the DM gives it to him, but not without  a devilish twist. He names a number, an arbitrarily high one that for the sake of the story I will say is about six thousand feet. The Cleric nods, looks at his character sheet and says 'Not to worry, I have 8000 ft of rope'.",

The only way to use another weapon is to have the sword far enough away to not immediately pop into their hands (at least 90 ft.)\n\nThe thing I love about this weapon is that Ownership is not a curse.  Curses can be removed.  The owner of the sword wanted to never be disarmed and thus enchanted it specifically for this purpose.\n\nI gave this sword to a group who had the usual response of \"why am I attacking with this\" and attempting to drop it mid-combat.  Eventually they figured out through trial and error that it takes the straightest path.  So they started having the rogue take the sword, sneak to the other side of a group of enemies, and lay the sword on the ground.  Then the person with the sword started to attack, causing the sword to fly through all of the enemies in the way.  I started planning my encounters better after that :)",

We haven’t really paid much attention to the guidelines or rules or whatever, and that’s mostly because myself and a friend are, while totally eager, wholly inexperienced. Luckily, our DM is witty, smart, and experienced.\n\nAlmost immediately i get thrown out of the starter tavern by a man with no tolerance for yo momma jokes. So I sit like a child outside in the gutter, wherein I happen to meet an ordinary rat. I immediately ask DM if I can befriend, which I do. I name him Charleston and he becomes my companion, and the party’s reason to live, but no-one readily useful. \n\nEarly on we discover a sort of magic shop, with a ton of spellbooks. As I peruse I pick a book with an interesting insignia of a green skull. The DM, eager to see me finally advance in any aspect whatsoever, asks if I’m interested in buying. I say yes. He begins to tell me what I’ve learned, before I interrupt and declare that I’m not the one reading it. I pass the book to Charleston, who squeaks and looks at the pages before the book disappears, having fulfilled it’s one use limit. Everyone’s rather peeved with what they consider a waste of a spellbook, but I tell them to have faith in my street hamster. The DM tells us that since Charleston cannot speak English, we have no way of knowing if he actually learned anything. Henceforth, Charleston is now Charleston the potentially magical rat.\n\nA hop, skip, and a foiled assassination attempt on a king in another town, everyone except me is getting handsomely rewarded for their civic duties. Citing my attachment to the would-be assassin’s “Mozzarella Stick Man” persona, as well as the fact that my involvement in foiling the King’s assassination was totally accidental, I am denied my payment. I get heated, choice words were said, and everybody gets booted out of the city’s walls.\n\nMy companion is happy to share the gold he got, but I’m angry. I got shorted, scammed. The King disrespected me, even after I fought a man I once loved as the Mozzarella Stick Man. I was emotionally distraught. Seeking vengeance, I pull Charleston out of my shirt pocket, look him in his eyes, instruct him to let loose on the town, and I set him on the ground facing the city.\n\nWe wait for a few seconds, and nothing really happens. Then, the sound of dice being rolled is heard, and a sigh soon follows. The DM describes how Charleston unhinges his jaws, and lets loose a giant cloud of slow moving acidic poison. It engulfs the city, liquidating everything and everyone, including the bastard king. Nothing is salvageable, flesh and stone is indistinguishable, it’s all goo. My companion and I stare, dumbfounded at the sheer magnitude of our atrocity, before turning tail and fleeing with Charleston the now definitely magical rat.\n\nWe later told any NPC we came across about the Nazi village we decimated in the name of equality and love, because we figured that while the power exemplified by our actions was something marvelous, genocide was generally frowned upon.",

Broken to the point that within a few building points leveling up a 'beam' type of power, you can target anything in the known universe. I had to invent this pink crystalline substance to coat things in, that was indestructible to all known forces.\n\nSo I let my players go a little wild, with the caveat that everything had a consequence. It got so bad that they had to live in a space station, because no country on Earth was legally letting them in.\n\nOn a routine space mission that involved liberating some space aliens from another crooked space empire, I set the scene with a little background description. They awoke in a slave-holding cell, amidst several various aliens. A few mantis-men, some women in varying shades of green, and a couple of slugs piled in the corner.\n\nSo as it turns out, my brief mention of the alien slugs was enough to enamor my players with them, who then carted the non-verbal, expressionless, barely sentient slugs through the entire mission, whispering reassuring things to them about how they'd soon go home to their families. \n\nBy the end of the mission, two players had secretly conspired to steal the slugs, and smuggle them back to their base. They succeeded. The healer of the group, a shirtless, open-lab-coated, goggled man called Dr. Lazarus, put them into a glass cage, and went to bed. \n\nWhen he awoke he asked what happened when he checked on them. I told him that overnight, the slugs had taken over the entire cage, and a significant corner of the room, coating it in slime and birthing a million babies. He then spent his earned XP points investing in, and maxing out, an ability called \"Inter-dimensional pocket\" which basically meant he could fit an infinite amount of matter into... the pocket of his labcoat. \n\nWith that, he scooped up every slug and ball of slime he could, then put them into his pocket. It became a running joke across sessions. We began with Dr. Lazarus checking on the slugs, and I decided the mechanic would be that whatever he gave them, they'd just over-invest in, in the course of a few days.\n\nBy the first session, their population was in the tens of millions. He introduced them to a granola bar. They cultivated granola and fed themselves. He gave them a piece of technology, robotics specifically. By the next session, they were three generations into the Robot-Slug-Wars. He calmed the wars, and made them happy by leaving an iphone in his pocket- which played a constant loop of \"What's up?\" by 4 Non Blondes. So, every time he checked on the slugs, that song played at the table.\n\nIt got to the point that he had put points into \"summon minion\", which then let him put points into the abilities of his minion. From this random background detail, we ended up with our healer summoning slugs in robot suits to fight for him. \n\nAnd final kicker. Once, the slug slime was introduced to the jet-fuel-fire of the tech suit hero's rocket boot. It hardened to a pink crystalline substance, unbreakable by any known force...",

When you purchased anything from him, you rolled a d20 and based on your roll, it was usually nothing, but occasionally turned out to be blessed or cursed.  Since he existed on a pier, you could buy before setting sail, but it was a complete gamble that might result in losing money and ending up with a completely garbage item.\n\nOne of the party members bought an item called \"mummy dust\" that would supposedly conjure a mummy to fight for you if you threw it onto the ground in battle.\n\nWell, this guy throws the mummy dust down a few days letter, and lo and behold, he gets... a small imp-like creature named Waffles.  \n\nWaffles is half-bat, half-monkey, and beholden to follow simple instructions but is also an incredible fucking nuisance.  Waffles can speak about as well as a 3-year-old child, in a very shrill, high voice.  Waffles can teleport (if he has a line of sight) which means he can get into any room with a keyhole, but Waffles is generally too simple to be useful for any sort of thievery.  Waffles is very loud, high-maintenance, and generally annoying.  \n\nWaffles eats birds (and also, anything with a bird on it, including coins, jewelry, and finery).  \n\nWaffles can't overtly disobey, but he also can't leave his master, lie directly (even if ordered), follow instructions of more than 2 steps, or concentrate for longer than a few minutes at a time.  Waffles definitely has some simple magic but Waffles is not a creature whose magic can really be directed or controlled.  He mostly uses it to find and eat birds.\n\nDespite his magic, Waffles rapidly becomes a massive burden to the party.  Having been conjured, you cannot get rid of him.  He is bound to whomever conjured him, and he's an incredible piece of indestructible shit.  He periodically shrieks, \"HI.  I'M WAFFLES.  I EAT BIRDS.\"  All efforts to make Waffles useful fail abysmally, and the party eventually just learns to ignore him.\n\nFast-forward.  My party has been sailing around a little archipelago and have come to an island.  The people of the island worship an active volcano and make sacrifices into it.  After weeks of adventuring on the island, the party manages to successfully stop a ritual sacrifice and free a bunch of slave women.  Waffles is with them the whole time and he has mostly just tagged along, eating birds.  (He has gotten them into trouble twice: once by eating a cargo hold full of exotic birds being shipped for trade, and once by eating a register full of coins stamped with a bird logo.)\n\nSo the island volcano begins to erupt, and it's revealed that the villagers weren't actually completely full of shit.  The volcano is actually the sentient avatar of a volcano demi-god.  The island *is* the god, and the villagers knew what they were doing, and now it appears the whole island is about to erupt into flame and fall into the sea because of its lack of sacrifice.\n\nMy party, instead of getting off the island, decides to run up to the peak of the volcano and do battle with the volcano god.  \n\nNeedless to say they get their asses kicked.\n\nThen, just as it seems like the whole party is about to be completely destroyed, the guy who is in charge of Waffles looks at me and and says, \"Hey, is it a clear night?\"\n\nI have him roll.  Yes, it's a clear night; they can see the stars.\n\n...remember how I said Waffles can teleport as long as he has a line of sight?\n\nThe player actually got choked up as he said, \"Waffles, I want you to grab onto the volcano god, and teleport into the sky, as far and high as you can.\"\n\nWaffles grabs onto the volcano god with his long fingers.

With an earth-shattering shake, the star lands on the island, breaking off part of it and obliterating a huge swatch of jungle.  The fallout from this event is absolutely catastrophic.  It destroys half the island, though it does save the other half, and, miraculously, the idiot party that wanted to fight an actual, literal god has all lived to tell the tale.\n\nEmboldened by their success, the party charges into the fiery wreckage to see what has become of the volcano god.\n\nIn a crater as deep as three men, amidst the rubble and burned-out hellscape that was once a lush jungle, they find Waffles, clinging to a black stick of a still-smoking tree.  His leathery wings are burnt away, leaving only sticks protruding from his back, and he is blackened with soot, barely living.  Seeing his master, he looks up, and stutters out, in his high-pitched, irritating little voice:\n\n\"Hi.  I'm W-waffles.  I eat b-birds.\"",

Later after a mission, they were partying it up in an anthill (long story) and the artificer, drunk, decided she wanted to make sending stones for the party. I told her there was no way in hell that was going to happen but to go ahead and try. I can’t remember the exact rolls but ultimately I decided that she made the party stones that looked exactly like sending stones, but when activated they just played Tubthumping by Chumbawumba at a wildly loud volume. It was an inside joke for the group and it got a lot of laughs and I figured that would be it, since they’d gotten a fucking HOARDE of wondrous items that they’d flat out ignored. NOPE. This group took those stones and became goddamn MacGyver with them, finding a million and one ways to use them. It was honestly so impressive.  Tie em to an enemy’s ears for a torture technique.

Party proceed to immediately exploit the DMs homerules, capture cart, seize all future enemy carts they encounter, and eventually use their fleet to establish a massive trading company rivalling the East Empire Trading Company. \n\n\nI wasn't the DM so much as a member of the exploiting party. A friend ran a Skyrim based campaign using a home brew version of the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay System. The system places unarmed characters at massive disadvantage when fighting armoured opponents, doubling any armour value when calculating damage, which the DM hoped would control the party enough at the start of the campaign to get us where they wanted. Unfortunately, the DM had also decided that Khajit and Argonians would have natural weapons due to their claws allowing them to circumnavigate this problem. The DM didn't really see an issue with this though as their was only one Argonian character and they were playing a non-combat class. \n\nThe campaign included starting the party as captives, unarmed and being transported via cart. Instead of listening to our DMs repeated warnings that we would need to either wait and see what happens or escape incredibly quickly to avoid being overpowered; our murder hobo happy group insisted on capturing the cart. With the exploitation of many racial abilities and some lucky rolls we were successful despite wearing nothing but the classic rags and chains. This mostly involved the Orc Blacksmith using their prodigious strength to grapple guards one by one, leaving them unable to defend themselves while the Argonian Servant clawed them to pieces and the rest of the party ran temporary interception on other guards. \n\nSo began a tradition of capturing the carts or wagons of any opponents, adding each to our growing caravan. Our more diplomatic party members were able to convince a number of bandits to actually work for us as a response to the eventual problem we faced; too many carts, not enough drivers. Arguing that steady pay was preferable to facing down a party of armed travellers, and promising to help their families as well. We eventually established a transport and trading company using our commandeered vehicles and became large enough to challenge the East Empire Trading Company.",

The team is trying to throw rocks on it to trigger it from a distance. I step outside the tent to piss. Right as my buddy goes to trigger the trap, all they hear from outside the tent is “WAIT!!!”\n\nA long pause later and I unzip the tent still zipping up my pants…”I HAVE A ROWBOAT!!!” I shouted with a huge shit eating grin on my face. \n\nThe DM just dropped his head in his hands and said he was done.

It was  basically a cursed (can't be removed non-magically) ring of sustenance in disguise that had the added effect that the wearer no longer produces bodily waste. (blood, sweat, tears, saliva, pee, poo, vomit, etc.) Instead, whenever they would produce waste it is teleported out of their body over the head of an adult dragon. Whenever that happens, if the DM ever rolls 100% a stinky doodoo-brown dragon has found the wearer and is on its way to kill them. \n\nThe party I was DMing for at the time was a bunch of (six irl engineering majors) CN min-max murderhobo edge-lords that liked to break games. So as soon as they realized what the item was, they immediately gave it to the party artificer to make everybody in the party one for each finger and toe. Then, they ate and drank a ton all the time to increase their odds of encountering a dragon. \n\nThe bastards started a dragon-slaying business and proceeded to casually murder every dookie-covered dragon they crossed paths with until they literally went extinct. Then the party wizard wished more dragons into existance. Rinse and repeat. They got uber-rich quick, reached epic levels quick, and built several mega-cities decorated with the bones of every dragon ever. \n\nThat party of dragon slayers became the villians of my next campaign featuring the same group of players.",

The DM rolled behind his screen, laughed, and said I had found my bells, had a lovely day, and met a unicorn (one of my character's stated life goals).  He had me roll CHA to see what kind of impression I left on the unicorn and I nat20'd it.  So he gave me one (1) set of silver ankle Plum Moon Day Bells that, when rung, would summon an elder unicorn who now owed me one (1) favor.\n\nThey were promptly forgotten about for months.\n\nIt's the end of the campaign.  The BBEG is winning, we're rolling badly, our party's pet NPC (Chosen Prince flavor) is in rough shape and needs to rally his armies and his horse is dead.  I look down at my stained, battered character sheet and spot a scribbled note in the far corner of my inventory.\n\nThe Plum Moon Day Bells.\n\n\"Guys,\" I say, \"Briar's got a unicorn who owes her a favor.\"\n\nThe faces around the table light up.\n\nMy character rings the bells and blows her one favor on getting the unicorn to let the Prince ride him.\n\nOur party rides forth with the Prince as his vanguard.  We are busting out Mass Combat Rules for this shit, and the Prince riding on the symbol of his House is providing massive morale bonuses to our troops, and the elder unicorn is also fucking shit up as essentially an extra high-level mage.\n\nAnd then the BBEG gets a nat20.  Prince is dead before he hits the ground.  Our characters and the unicorn gather around his body.  He is SUPER dead.\n\n(When I say this was our pet NPC, I am in fact understating how much every person at the table adored this imaginary man.  There were tears, is what I'm saying.)\n\nThe person playing the quiet, notes-taking character looks up, stares the DM dead in the eye like he owes her money, and asks if the elder unicorn knows Wish or True Resurrection.\n\nThe DM, who is a big fan of \"say yes or roll the dice,\" rolls the dice behind his screen.  He facepalms, picks up the spiral notebook with his homebrew stat blocks in it, throws it over his shoulder, and says, \"You're not going to let him die, are you?  Yes.\"\n\nOur characters make one big concerted Persuasion check against the unicorn.  Whole party, every bonus, every magic item, every spell thrown into this.  We succeed wildly.\n\nThe unicorn lowers his head, touches the Prince with his horn, and the Prince lives once more.\n\nThe BBEG's minions promptly fail some morale checks, the BBEG is left alone and scrabbling at his plans, and with our pet NPC we save the world.\n\nAll because it was Plum Moon Day and I forgot my bells.",

I had skipped getting my mount because I was being very ... well, for a word, diva-y and I wanted something special. A war pony would just not do. This story has nothing to do with me getting a mount, but still.\n\nWe wound up in a dwarven hall, having just defeated some dwarven stone mechs with some acid.  There was an archway in front of us with a tall, tall straight stairway on the other side. The DM had your typical, wicked smile so we proceed cautiously. \n\nOn the other side of the archway is a - the DM described it, we listened, and we basically boiled it down to something that looks like a security camera. The gnome makes an illusion and has it run up the stairs. A laser pointer starts tracking it and then ZIP the illusion is smoked by a beam of light.\n\nThe speedy elf (dick) bolts up the stairs. 40 feet per second. He avoids the tracking laser and is able to reach the top of the stairs. The rogue runs up the stairs, gets caught in the laser but is able to make a high heavenly evasion roll to dodge the beam. (or maybe the elf was the rogue? I forget.) The gnome and the wizard are up next, the gnome makes a bunch of illusions and has them run at differing speeds while and the wizard shoots the dome with a bolt as he runs up. The tracking laser stops but now the dome produces a wide swarth of a beam that sweeps up the stairs, obliterating the illusions, but by this point the wizard and the gnome are at the top of the stairs. (maybe they were the same character, too. Unsure.)\n\nSo there I am. A Dwaft Pally. 20 move speed. In full plate. I was already pissed about this session, and this seemed like a death nail. \n\nBut then I got clever. \n\nI went back to the pool of acid that was one of the rock mechs and tested it with my shield. My shield was acid proof. Cool. So I gathered up enough of the acid on my equipment and used my shield and fist as a sort of make-shift climbing gear, jamming the acid-dipped tip of my shield in to the wall and climbing the 12 up the arch. I took my sword - also coated - and began using it to break away at the stone that held the device to the wall. \n\nWith a couple of risky balance checks I was able to dislodge it. Sensing movement (not knowing that it was moving, not a target) it started to fire. A wide, sweeping beam of holy fire in front of me. I did the only logical thing a dwaft would do when faced with such craftsmanship...\n\nI used some of the melting stone to adhere it to my shield and then covered it with a cloak to prevent it from constantly BWAAAAAMing every time I moved. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say, 1 round to \"unsheathe\" before dealing 6d6 holy damage in a 15 foot cone in front of me on the next round made a lot of encounters a lot easier from then on. I guess I could've tested to see if I was just immune to it? Idk what my dm's idea for me getting past it was, but the table hated it from then on.",

So, at one point, our barbarian finds a set of painted wax apples- a red, blue, and yellow one. These apples can change the color of any object they touch for up to three days. I didn't think it sounded like it could break the game or anything, just some fun shenanigans here and there.\n\nSo, a couple sessions later, our party comes across a coastal town being plagued by a moving island that keeps crashing its supply ships- I went into great detail about how they couldn't import or export by sea anymore and how the town was dying and fishermen were losing theor family businesses and all that.\n\nThey meet an artificer who offers to pay them a crap ton of gold to retrieve a package from a ship that was attacked by this living island, and after some investigating, they decide to visit the island itself. I'm sure you know the drill- it's actually a dragon turtle with a cult of kobolds living on it, stealing supplies and treasures, kobolds try to kill them for trying to steal the package from the dragon's hoard, yadda yadda. When they found this out, they immediately want to speak to this turtle dragon. \n\nMy players are (generally) good aligned, they like to try diplomacy first almost all the time (which I love, frankly.) However, because they are so good alligned, I sort of expected them to have this poor little coastal towns best interests at heart. Nope. They tell the dragon \"If you give us the package, we'll show you how to lure even MORE ships in! With these magic apples, you can turn yourself into a spectacle that people will just HAVE to investigate!\" And, you know, it was a clevet solution and use of minor objects, kind of in character for the dragon to consider it. So I let them roll for it, and behold. They avoided a big battle, made an ally of a freakin dragon, and doomed an entire town and countless sailors for some money. All with some apples covered in finger paint.\n\nOne of these days I want to send them back to that town so they can see the full consequences. Just for giggles.",

Just as they were leaving the dungeon, there was a small force of 34 barbarians and 3 stone giants waiting outside the dungeon to fight them. He raised her thumb, and made a speech on how they just slew Thane Kayalithica, meaning that goliaths are superior to stone giants in the Ordning.

They had their eyes set on taking this town for a few sessions now because they didn't like the people who controlled it. Anyways, the giants served as the siege equipment and the barbarians as infantry. The party also used the stone giants' pet roc (giant bird), an airship that they got from some dragon cultists, and some well-placed fireballs from the party wizard for aerial support. The battle was close. However, about a third of the town's militia surrendered since they didn't want to fight giants or face the wizard's fireball. Another third fled and another third were either thrown 50 feet by the giants, dropped 100 feet by the roc, or consumed by fire. In the end, they became rulers of not only the town, but also the surrounding lands it influenced (about the size of a small kingdom) all because the barbarian took a thumb.\n\n\nTl;dr The barbarian used a severed giant thumb to convince other giants to join his army and take over a town.",

The fighter gets lucky searching Old Bonegrinder and finds it in a wall. Given he was a samurai with the sunblade, he wished to have lightning fast reflexes. He received the ability to block attacks when he rolled a dc20 dex save, and got a +10 to dex for this purpose,  but he gained the flaw that if he was startled, he would attack what scared him. He told nobody.\n\nThe next session, the promiscuous paladin found out about the paw, and given that there were 2 more party members and two more fingers on the paw, he took it. He said \"I know that this is going to end badly, but my character would do it. I wish I had a bigger d***\". So I rolled a d6, and it became 4ft long. He could use it at a floatation device, could no longer hurdle objects, and would pass out due to blood loss if he became...excited. \n\nAfter spending hours searching for a wheelbarrow for the newly endowed paladin, the artificer became irritated and took the paw, and screamed \"i wish his d*** was smaller!\". I rolled percentile die, and the paladin became an infant. The artificer, terrified at what he had done, threw the baby paladin at the fighter, who hadn't been paying attention. He turned around, shocked, to an infant flying at him, and rolled  a natural 19 on his attack roll, chopping the paladin into four equal pieces. \n\nAnd that is how the character with the most backstory in any of my games died.",

But anyways, my four friends were a warrior, mage, rogue and a ranger. Near the beginning of the game the mage asked me if he could obtain the power to summon literally anything he can think of at any time, I told him I would allow it but he would have to roll an 18 or higher to perform any super crazy summons that he might come up with. He rolled for the chance to get this ability, he got a 12, so I gave it to him. This power never really did them much good for the next week or so of the campaign, mage would try to act ballsy and summon something incredible and roll low and find himself knocked out or injured, but sometimes he'd be smart and summon something small like a flaming tornado to burn away the enemies. I spent 2 weeks of this campaign sending my players on a massive journey across the land through dungeons and battle fields planning a massive boss fight with Klauth, one of the oldest, most powerful and fearsome dragons in history. The party finally found themselves in a cave riddled with gold, face to face with Klauth with no means of escape in sight. When the mage's turn comes up he slams his hands down on the table and says \"I SUMMON MEHRUNES DAGON TO DEFEAT THE DRAGON BY SMASHING HIM WITH HIS BIG TOE\"! Unsurprisingly this caused myself and the entire party to roar with laughter, before realizing he was completely serious. For those of you who may not know, Mehrunes Dagon is a massively fearsome and overpowered Daedric Prince from The Elder Scrolls III. I told him to go ahead and roll for it. NAT. FUCKING. 20. I then had to sit back and let out a massive painful sigh, defeated as I knew I had no choice but to watch 2 weeks of hard work unravel before my very eyes. One of the funniest yet most painful D&D moments of my life to this day was uttering the sentence \"Your hands shoot up into the air and with a massive burst of shining light, a portal rips open from the very fabric of spacetime itself, and Mehrunes Dagon emerges, squishing Klauth between his toes like a grape before returning to the portal and disappearing in a flash of white light\".\n\n\nTL;DR: My campaign that I spent over 2 weeks working on was destroyed in a split second before my very eyes by a literal demon god from Morrowwind.",

I agreed, and at some point the bard gave it temporarily to the party's fighter. Fighter enters detailed Jurassic Park simulation where he begins getting chased by a giganotosaurus on horseback. In his desperation, he attempts to play the recorder. He has no performance buff, rolls so low on performance that combined with being bounced around on a horse, his music was so bad it destroyed the simulation of the dinosaur. Later on, as they were fighting Rick Astley on a t-rex, said fighter attempts to play the recorder again and does so well this time that the whiplash Rick gets from hearing the differences in music performance causes him to take psychic damage. As this is a boss battle, almost half the hp from this boss (Rick) was taken out via a fighter frantically trying to play a recorder.\n\nMuffins: Allowed party to buy muffins for cheap from this bakery in a town. Bard proceeds to buy 200 of them, stand in the town square, and begin preaching her cult while screaming and throwing muffins. Rolls high on performance, doubles her following.\n\nthe chickens: Rogue asks for 76 chickens that can fit and sustain themselves in a magical hat. I agree because why not. She keeps them as pets, they overall don't do much. Until she singles one out and begins training and levelling it up. It becomes stronger. Buffer. More intelligent. Until one day, it goes on a sidequest that helps take down the cult the party was working to destroy.\n\nthe seagulls: This one is actually mine. Rogue is now the DM of this campaign and I'm a player (wizard). I ask for baby seagulls, she agrees (I guess as a thank you for the chickens). I get 73 baby seagulls that exist in an alternate dimension. They are self sustaining and will age normally. They are completely useless in combat. As a player, I notice the potential of the untapped sushi market in the continent I'm on. I set out with the single goal of making a sushi empire. I begin making sales and establishing connections in various towns. I spend time teaching those seagulls various tricks (they now appear around me whenever I saw \"avengers, assemble\" and dab simultaneously when I tell them to \"perform the ritual.\" I use my seagulls and those tricks to endear myself to the people in new towns. Around those I need the respect of, this mysterious ability makes me appear larger than life. I allow those who are interested to pet my baby seagulls, as they are indeed quite cute. As a lone wizard who started at level one with no connections and very few resources, excelling in social situations becomes key for my empire to succeed. Because of my subpar charisma stat, my seagulls become an important tool in getting on the good side of some people.\n\nWill probably update later when I think of more.",

They haven't yet figured out that the items themselves are spawning skeletons, just that the skeletons are in the room. They keep killing them, the skeletons keep respawning. Well, Rogue decides that she wants one of the skeleton's skulls, so she pulls it out of the coffin. Once the arcane goo drips off of it, it starts talking to her. Naturally, she names it Yorick. They smash all of the coffins and stop the skeletons from spawning, but there's still Yorick. He's got the worst new york accent of your racist uncle from long island and a heart of gold. He gives advantage on history checks cause he's an awakened skull from a long time ago. Because Yorick's favorite phrase is \"WAZZAAAAAAP,\" he lives inside Rogue's bag of holding.\n\nFast forward eight months. The party finds themselves in the feywild being asked to determine the new ruler of a small homebrew fey court. Instead of picking one of their options, they decide to elect Yorick, who has gained gemstone eyes and a dryad skeleton. He can walk now and also see. Yorick is more than happy to be an agent of chaos and piss off the fey in the process, and of course get cool powers. The party teaches him about communism and seizing the means of production. They get him elected, and Rogue walks up to him to say her tearful goodbyes. Then she fucking rolls a nat 20 slight of hand to steal Yorick off his dryad skeleton and jump through the portal he just created to send them home. So now Yorick is a demigod and a god killing weapon and they still only use him for history checks.\n\nAnother three months later. The party has returned from christmas vacation for a beach episode to get them reacclimated to playing 5e after we had a short stint with pathfinder. Rogue decides she's bored of the party's bullshit and sneaks off to steal. Another nat fucking 20. She gets herself 400 platinum, a diamond necklace, and a cursed dagger, because I felt the need to teach her a lesson. Well, she gives the dagger to Yorick to identify, and Yorick rolls a nat 1 on his save to not be processed by the being trapped in the sentient dagger. He realizes that he's been kept in a bag for his whole existence and teleports away. I think that I've got a new BBEG! This is great!\n\nWell. Rogue then steals one of the lesser villains wish swords (works like the soul stone in endgame) and stabs herself, getting a wish and turning back time by 20 minutes so that she can't give Yorick the dagger. She's now dead, so they find a cleric to rez her, and she comes back to life, and everything is good. Except that I still have to deal with this fucking skull that has the powers of a 5000 year old archfey and Rogue likes to remind me of that every fucking session.",

All opponents are considered to have total concealment (50% miss chance) against the blinded character. Blind creatures must make a DC 10 Acrobatics skill check to move faster than half speed. Creatures that fail this check fall prone. Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.\n\nBlinded, and out of the fight, he tore the rest of the party apart.

They did hold onto it for a while, using it to dispose of some of the more dangerous items they came across. Nothing super crazy. The problem came about a few levels later.\n\nThey wanted a specific item from (again, a randomly rolled) magic item vendor's stock. The item in question was ridiculously expensive, and essentially transferred crazy power to one of their party members (belt of stone giant strength, I believe? It essentially gave you endgame levels of strength when worn, without caveats). Our barbarian was obviously super interested in the item, and was desperately rummaging around in her bag looking for something to trade. She pulled the bag of devouring out, and offered it up with a look on her face that was half hope, half chagrin at having nothing of value at that particular moment.\n\nSo I look up the rarity of the item.

I've characterized the shopkeeper they're visiting as loving weird, unique, oddity-type items (even going so far as to have him offer top dollar for a random barely-enchanted knick-knack they found at the beginning of the campaign for a laugh and a bit of a windfall), so I rule that he probably wouldn't even try to haggle. Triple fuck. She asks if he'd consider trading the belt to drop the price that he'd be paying for such an item. I jump on the opportunity, not wanting to overload my party with gold. I look up the price of the belt. It's a Very Rare item as well, thank fuck. I roll a 1. Quadruple fuck.\n\nMy party walked out with a near-gamebreaking item for their barbarian, several armfuls of lesser magic items, and 20k gold pieces left over, as well as a magic item shopkeeper that owes them a favor. Hooray for campaign balance from then on lmfao\n\n(Fortunately, it was a group of four women and one very quiet dude. They had just \"inherited\" an abandoned keep that they'd cleared out. It, oddly enough, cost them around 19k gold pieces to fully furnish and renovate. The only pain it really caused me was two sessions of interior decorating and drawing up floor plans for a keep. Well, that and trying to balance around a very pissed off dwarven barbarian that went from barbara walters to she-hulk in a single transaction.)",

But man there were a few times I was both amazed yet horrified with what they did.\n\nOne time, they were trying to capture this Netrunner that had stolen sensitive data from the Corp they worked for. One team managed to sneak through the front door and bypass the security system, while the other team was ready to blow a hole in a different location of the base in order to enter and rout any forces which may try to fall back into the base.\n\nAs their Netrunner was trying to get through the system, their fixer managed to sneak into the bunks and found a Security Officer who was extremely drunk and managed to mistake him for one of the men stationed at the base. After being manhandled for a bit, the player rolled for perception to see what was in the room. I told him there was just a few empty bottles of liquor, some cloth to clean weapons and miscellaneous junk.\n\nI discovered shortly thereafter that I had made a big mistake, as the player in question somehow managed to justify that they had or could cannibalize things they had on them along with items in the room to put together multiple molotov cocktails. Now, under ordinary circumstances this wouldn't be a problem. I just assumed that it would essentially be another grenade they would use, as they liked to keep stocked up on weaponry. It was, after all, a perfect tool to cut off a corridor, which is the sort of thing this player would normally do.\n\nHowever, this player decided he was going to use this to cause a distraction once the team blew open the other wall. Once they did so, he tossed the molotov into the bunk room. Problem is, he had deliberately arranged things so that it would spread fire as quickly as possible.\n\nWhat was originally envisioned as a tactical assault on an enemy hideout turned into the fastest game of \"let's see how fast we can force the fire to spread\" that I have ever seen. Not only did it take out the room, the player accidentally helped it envelop most of the base, nearly killed the target they were sent to capture, and nearly killed the leader of the group who had all the ties to the Corp they worked for. All because I didn't anticipate a molotov, which had been used before with very little effect beyond temporarily blocking a corridor or being used as fear tactics, to be used as the thrown equivalent of Napalm in a forest.\n\nThat's not even going into detail how, during all this, another member of their team found a pressure washer, managed to somehow convince me that it should be able to stun a person/be moved to the bottom of the initiative queue should the enemy be caught unaware, used a total of one time before managing to somehow make the grunts fighting in the hall think that they've set a large ball of explosives rolling after them since the grunts both got critical failures on their roles.",

So evil was running wild and it was up to the players to quell the bad stuff happening and figure out what happened to the deity and the angels.\n\nOne of the characters was an alchemist, so during the campaign I had him find an [Alchemy Jug](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/om.php?vo=alchemy-jug) for added flavor so he could use it to make potions and stuff. After looking through the list of fluids, he laughed at \"mayonnaise\" and suddenly he wanted to try using mayo on everything.\n\nLater in the campaign the party tracks down this evil demon worshipping cult to a seemingly abandoned estate. They find the secret entrance to a dungeon and discover a whole host of angels locked in cages under some kind of magical anesthesia, having their blood drained out of them and pooling together in the middle of the room that was draining and being collected somewhere down below. The group realize that they are collecting the blood for some kind of nasty ritual and need to think fast to disrupt the ritual.\n\nThe alchemist player looks right at me, eyes sparkling in delight, and says, \"I pour 2 gallons of mayonnaise down the blood drain.\" Everyone was laughing hysterically. I am in utter shock because that would totally corrupt the ritual. For his quick thinking, I quickly changed the story to the demon was summoned, but severely weakened by the...contamination in the ritual, so he turned on the cultists and killed them all and the party was able to easily defeat him.",

Slowly started to spread our religion as we traveled.  We would convince people to get in the bag or force them.  The bag says it is the mouth to a giant extradimensional creature.  So each person we put inside would be put in this other crazy dimension.  Basically, this would make the people we put inside believe in our religion.\n\nI had a barbarian that I had put a bunch of proficiency into History, so the DM allowed me to roll for history whenever we put someone into the bag.  I also had a huge STR bonus which allowed me to pull anyone I wanted out of the bag.  Basically, I was able to write a whole bible about the bag and those who have entered it.\n\nWe could go to town and find a church that had sprung up.  Our religion was spreading faster than we could spread it ourselves.  We kept converting high level people in towns, then spreading it through the rest of the town.  \n\nBasically, it got to a point where we had converted most of the world to our religion.  Plus, since we had control of the bag of devouring we were seen as the prophets.   We could pretty much get away with anything.    If we wanted to get rid of someone we would just convince them to get into the bag, after that we just wouldn't help them get out.  \n\nProbably one of my favorite campaigns, sadly we didn't get to finish it.  The DM had changed the whole story to start to focus on our religion and the bag.  It's just crazy because it all started from one item.

He homebrewed some weapon that was supposed to knock us out, have us boarded, kidnapped, and wake up weaker and without our gear or ship.

Most of the players were annoyed since we wanted to do a space-themed campaign and not a dungeon crawl.)\n\nThe bad guys show up and the everyone but me is knocked out,  thanks to my character's stat and the most epic series of high rolls.

In the shop he found, he bought a snake, which supposed to just stop him using up all our time looking for a pet. I immediately suggested he killed it and turned it into a whip of some sort, which when asked if this would actually work, the dm said it would decompose quickly. After some thinking, we realised that he could enchant the corpse of the snake to make it indestructible, which we thought was absolutely hilarious. Slightly later on, we found something (can’t remember what) that had the ability to revive this dead animal, so thats how my friend became the proud owner of an indestructible headless snake. Due to it being unkillable, we could use it to get across gaps, we scared off a gang when their leaders sword broke trying to slice through it, it once let us kill a fairly difficult boss because it was being so annoying the boss wasn’t bothering us.",
