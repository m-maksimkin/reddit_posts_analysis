Size strength and all of that doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs how you use everything. \n\n1. Touch or lack there of is one of the greatest things you could do. \nEx. When I am getting all lovey dovey with a girl and we are kissing I go down to her neck down her body. Around her nipple and down her stomach. Go slow and build tension. When you get down below do not repeat do not touch her üòº. Kiss around it and tease her. That will turn her on way more than you will know. The slowly kiss her clit turn it into sucking with some licking. Learn the clit and treat it as a treat you want to savor small flicks of the tongue up goes  a long way. \n\n2. Bending the knees helps you stay hard but not to blast off. At the same time her G spot it at the top of her inside. My favorite move to do is like doing a thigh stretch where you sit on your legs and stretch your thighs but lean back. Your pelvis will aim upwards and hit her spot right on. (I am avg endowed and have yet to not hit the spot) I am telling you this move is better than any other move you can do. \n\n3. If you want to go as deep as you can turn her on her side and put her leg up if she is not flexible have her bend her knee but still hold it up to her side as high as she can. \n\n4. If you want to go into the  üçë you need to warm it up sticking it straight in will 1. Be very painful and turn off. 2. Tear something that will never be the same. \n\nMy solution is when you are doing doggy style wet your thumb and massage the area then go slowly in. Once your thumb is all the way in grab it. (Take your time)\nI then proceed to use it as a grip to pull her forward and back. They love it and way to proceed. (Usually)\n\n5. The reason I have never been ghosted is I make them cum/orgasm before I stick my friend in using whatever I want. So by the time I go in she has already been satisfied so it doesn‚Äôt matter if I last 5 seconds. \n\n6. Wear a Condom!!!\nNo one likes them. Not you or her but bet your ass you won‚Äôt like catching something or someone in 9 months. (Idc what they say that they are on or whatever best believe)\n\n7. My 2 favorite lubes are baby oil and aloe Vera (plant) you can get them at a local grocery vegetable aisle. You will have to cut it and peel it but it is so nice!\n\n8. BE NICE AND COURTEOUS \nDon‚Äôt be a dick vibe with the flow and be patient it is better for everyone and 9/10 you will have a repeat session. \n\n9. If you are going to choke make sure they want it before you just go ahead and choke a bitch. They have an actual technique for sex choking look it up. It‚Äôs not the same as regular choking. \nAnd have her tap on your arm to stop. And for the love of Christ STOP. \n\n10. 90% of women are either pillow princesses or bad and being in control. Learn how to be dominant but not aggressive. Their is a 100% difference!\n\nUse these 10 tips and tricks and up your sex game cause everyone deserves to have a good time!!!\n\nBonus- cut your nails the day before at the latest when you cut them that day they are sharper then before and will be a turn off. Scrap the inside of your mouth and if it hurts you it will definitely hurt her. \n\nNow have fun my kings!!!",

Choking her with one hand whilst grabbing breast with other, get up and pull her by the ankles towards the edge of the bed in a rapid motion, picking her off the bed and standing up whilst still sucking on her clitoris, throw her back on the bed, stuff your fingers down her mouth etc. (easier when shes much shorter than you)\n\n\n3) show extreme affection and aggression at the same time. So like lightly pecking her cheek and caressing her face whilst lightly grabbing her neck and jackhammering for instance",

From all of my friends, one does like it hard and fast (and wet), but the most of us have a very sensitive clit and it will hurt. So always start with a light touch and not too fast motion and if she likes it, you can work up the pressure and the speed slowly. Preferences between women differ of course, so this is a safe bet.   \n\n\nAlso, vagina's elongate, get wet and start to loosen up if she is aroused. A woman with a very tight and dry vagina is often not a good sign...  \n\n\nAlso: if she asks you to do x or y (without being an asshole), don't let your ego be attacked. Listen to what she says and ask questions for further clarification. Now this seems like an outrageous tip, but unfortunately a lot of boyfriends of our friend group hate to hear what their women prefer. I myself have experience with someone who admitted to me he purposely would do the opposite of what I said I liked, because if he did something that he had not figured out himself, he would feel like a loser at sex.",

Maybe someone who was like me, independent and lQQking for a good time. \nI was reading a few posts about being single.  screw that, I don't want to be single, alone and bored.\nWishing to get laid, combing the streets and all over online dating sites, like locato and others.   Besides all them online sites are just hookers, out for a hook up or FWB, or some sort of tax for sex.   Rarely do you meet someone who wants to date or get to know each other, or straight out get busy.   Thats what I want.  I don't want to be alone.  I am handsome and I got sex drive in me.  plus I like to be romantic an go out to clubs or movies, anything outside of the house.  But I do have a place to live and a legal car to drive.\n\nI wouldn't mind tenting up some place, after I found a woman and brought her home and started a connection.   Taking this new tent I got and driving up into the mountains and getting busy sounds good to me.  This way there is no TV or Computers and we can grind all night long, because thats what I like to do.\nOn the other hand, having a shower or bath tub to get clean all the time, is a perk.  Nothing like a clean woman/babe.   So all you single men who take to long to find a woman, and say its cool to be single\ncan Kiss my A?? because I want  woman/wife or gf and have kids and a family.\n\nYou ever thought about that?  Or do you want to be 40 or 50 and have no kids or family.  Then your are just going to be some OLD FOGGIE or BATTLE-AX.   Life is much more interesting to share it with someone.\nNow you are all wondering where I am at socially.  Im in Hollywood or Los Angeles and I am looking for a girl, I see a lot of Tents and Homeless and I am not talking the type of Tent I suggested.  These Tents have peek a boo holes in them and duct tape holding up \"YOU GOT CHANGE\" signs on them.  Its real dirty\nand a lot of blacks have migrated to Hollywood.  I don't mind Blacks, just telling how it its in Hollywood.\nBesides Black woman have nice big round Butts.   And I see a lot of them that I would jump.  Besides they don't like whites that much and I am white.\n\nMy advise, its easier to survive with a woman who is independent or beautiful.   Don't Pimp her either, God have some respect for yourself and others.  Online dating is so like 20 years ago.  Its all automation and holographic and not real.   They are programs that try to get you interested in women or men if you have,\nand these people are not even real.  If you sign up the messaging is totally automation and not real.  Try getting laid with a Computer.  LOL\n  I\nLocal Ladies of Los Angeles,  I am   malepostureatAOLdotCOM  \nI live in Hollywood      I am easy to contact  its in my name",

Yup, you can eat out an armpit or a palm and for some girls, it's going to be kind of like when a guy discovers his prostate for the first time. They'll be blown away. Ears are good too.\n\nAlso, leverage. Thrust and pull with your arms, wrists, back, thighs, arches of your feet.... If you're using leverage, you can last a lot longer than 30 minutes without getting too tired. Change your muscle groups and don't be afraid to do something like installing handles or foot purchases on your bed.  \n\n\nSex has a lot of 'manifestation' in it. For example, if you start out fake moaning, that's ok. It'll get real pretty quick, and it'll get that way faster if you just of manifest it. For example, if you're not hard... just thrust anyway. Get them genitals bumping, breathe like you're into it, moan like you're into it, what do you know? Thirty seconds later, you're both totally into it and your equipment is now functioning. Playing along and just doing it is like pulling the rip cord on a lawn mower. Just go at it and a lot of performance issues disappear immediately.  \n\n\nThe first time you have sex should be with someone where it won't matter if it's shitty or sloppy. Ideally, a girl that you're not dating or in love with, but just having fun with. Ideally, you both feel the same way and just want to learn and experience. If you have sex with someone that you're in love with and they judge you, that's heavy losses.  \n\n\nWhat you see in porn ain't real. Women need a LOT of foreplay, sometimes a good hour of making out to get them properly lubed up so it'll feel good when the fun starts. Always have your own lube anyway, and use plenty of it.  \n\n\nHave an issue with climaxing too fast? Masturbate about 5 hours before sex. Just for post nut clarity alone, it's a good idea to masturbate before every single date. Have an issue with NOT being able to climax? Do the opposite, no masturbation for a few days prior. Also know that it's totally fine to fantasize. What do you think about during masturbation? That's going to be the same thing that helps you nut during sex. Sometimes, it also helps to stop focusing on her own pleasure quite so much, and focus on that dick and how it feels. You'll nut. Let her climax first and there's nothing to be ashamed about taking a few minutes to focus on yourself.",

            "text": "Disclaimer: My partner of 16 years says I should write a pamphlet teaching men how to get a woman to orgasm. I've given half of my ten partners their first orgasm. So, I think I know a thing or two.\n\nIt's hard to explain in a few words, but mental excitement, anticipation, and being dynamic are the keys to the female orgasm. Orgasms are 80% mental. That includes the usual stuff about mindset, consent, comfort, etc, but that's only the meta part of it.\n\nThink of the 20% physical part like the keyboard to a computer.  Being good at lasting a long time or knowing just how to touch a g-spot are definitely bonuses, but they'll only get you to 20% where orgasms are concerned. \n\nPunching the keys in a way that makes sense to the computer and gets the desired effect is the 80%.\n\nExcitement: It should be obvious, but the more turned on she is, the more likely she is to get there. This is true for men too, of course, but it's doubly true for women. This is why foreplay is so important. But, don't let foreplay be all you do. Talk, touch, flirt, verbally anticipate having sex. Build excitement for it between you whether it's in ten minutes or a week. *It will pay off.* Quickies have their place in a healthy sex life, but nothing beats anticipated sex.\n\nCorollary: Female genitalia are super sensitive. Sexual arousal mitigates this quite a bit depending on just how aroused she is. Don't go straight for the most delicate bits, work up to it, and you might get to so something you wouldn't normally. She'll be less likely to be painfully sensitive and things will feel better. Patience.\n\nAnticipation: The sensation of physical touch is governed by expectation. You can prove it to yourself in 5 seconds. Draw a circle on the back of your hand. Then, do it again, but start from your shoulder and trace your finger down to where you drew the circle. Congratulations, you just learned how to make good things feel **great**. How sensational physical touch feels is directly tied to how much mental attention you give the sensation. **I can't emphasize this enough.** \n\nFor example: If you want to give head, instead of just putting your head between her thighs, start from her feet and give a sensual massage working your way up to her fun bits, kissing her skin along the way. By the time you put your mouth down there, she will gasp. And that's a ridiculously simple example. You can start before the bedroom just by talking and touching. Whisper in her ear that you have intentions. It all pays off.\n\nBeing dynamic: This is the flip side to anticipation. Say that you figure out that your partner really likes when you do A, B, and C. (You should strive for a much longer list than 3!) You have fun, sexy time and doing A gets them to orgasm. Cool, congrats. \n\nNow. Do you keep doing A or switch to B? There's usually a right answer. I find that sticking with what you're doing is only advisable when it's an absolute favorite thing of your partner and you've already done less favored things that they like, especially if those things already got them there. \n\nIdeally, you should know how your partner ranks your favorite moves and work from least to most favorite, trying for an orgasm with each one. (Don't be boring and always do the same thing. This is why you develop a bag of tricks.) When you're convinced one isn't gonna do the trick, that's when you move to the next thing that feels even better. If it does work, you **keep doing it until her orgasm is over.** With that method, even if only the last thing gets her there, the O will be that much better for all of the build up to it.  \nThis pays off the better you get to know your partner and what they like. When you have a treasure chest of tricks and favorite positions, sex is an adventure.\n\nThanks for coming to my TedTalk.",

If they're not interested in having sex, they may have something that's putting on the breaks, and most of these are emotional or mental.\n\nExamples of brakes, or inhibitors, include: thinking poorly about their own bodies (because you teased them or made a negative comment), associating sexual acts with being an immoral person, not feeling accepted by you, feeling judged by you, feeling used by you, etc. Everyone is different, and though each person may have different brakes, you need to know what these are. In general, being positive, caring, accepting, and non-judgmental about a woman is the best way to ensure her brakes don't get in the way of her feeling comfortable enough to express her sexuality. Work stress, money worries, and other common life issues can also be a brake.\n\nAs far as the gas, there are lots of things that turn women (and people) on. See basically every kink, turn-on, or sexual fantasy around. Find out what does it for your woman (by communicating) and giving it to her or helping her experience it.\n\nCommunication and knowing yourself, as well as your partner, is where great sex comes from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, get that pussy in your face and take care of her ass if she wants it.",

Not only will every person's preferences vary, but so too will their role. You can end up losing sight of what makes YOU feel good if your entire sexual identity is based around how good you are at making the other person orgasm. My advice is to make sex equitable.\n\nBUT, if you really want to blow someone's clit off, (and you have a larger than average dick) get a wedge pillow to put under her butt/hips. Have her lie down on her back with her pelvis supported by this pillow. When you thrust, aim your dick up into the anterior wall of her pussy. As you pull back, drop more or less straight down so that the head of your dick levers against that g-spot ridge right before popping out. Of course, limit the range of your thrusts so that you don't  actually pop out. When you thrust back in, you'll hit the g-spot and then go even deeper. This can create a lot of sideways torque on your dick, so keep control of your movements so you don't hurt yourself. But this is basically how to hit her g-spot with both the in AND out strokes. It feels amazing. She may squirt. You don't even need to thrust hard or deep. Just rock back and forth with this motion, utilizing constant or steadily repeated pressure on that spot.\n\nFor an added bonus, get a magic wand (or equivalent knock-off) and have her hold it against her clit while you do this. Your neighbors will hate you.\n\n(Disclaimer: this may be too intense for some women. That's fine. But the ones who can take it will love it.)",

Some.\n\nThe only reason to skip foreplay is if she's already \"on fire\" and can't wait.\n\nDepth patterns:  Give them 20% of the shaft 9 times then 100% 1 time. Start patterns in your head counting out 9&1, then 7&1, 5&1 and work your way up to full shafting.  Breath deeply.\n\nThen go full depth and stay there.  Begin to grind your mons pubis against her clitoris. This is what pubic hair is for and it's best when you both have plenty.  If you're lucky you both will match up in size and your tip will toy with the opening to her uterus at this point.  Find what grinding pattern works best and stick to it.  If it sounds like she's going to come, don't change patterns or speed.  Keep doing the same thing. Maybe start grunting more. Most people like to hear the other person make noises, within reason.  If you want to extend the session longer go back to the 9&1 pattern or go to jackhammering or something. Breath deeply\n\nYour orgasms are not as important as hers.  Mens orgasms are easy.  If you can get her to come easily and regularly, you're going to have sex much more frequently because she will want more.  She will sometimes demand more/harder/faster.  If doing this will make you come early, don't do it.  Breath deeply.\n\nWork out. Do yoga. Go jogging. Eat healthier. Do kegels everywhere(Google it. Google it right now). Use the fact that it's going to make you more attractive and better in the sack as a motivator.  There's nothing wrong with thinking of tits to move yourself forward.\n\nDon't be afraid to slap her butt, bite her neck, pin her hands down, pull her hair a little and massage her butthole with your thumb in doggy(see anal).   Just pay attention and make sure she's into it. Some people don't know how to tell someone they don't like something and just go along with stuff they aren't enjoying. Make sure she knows she can turn down sex (you can too). Sex is NOT an obligation, it's a bonus. Talk about it together.\n\nEvery woman I've been with has enjoyed being dominated in some way. But that's just my experience. It's your responsibility to pay attention to her and make her feel safe.  Some women's dream is to be the \"dirtiest whore in the world\" but only with someone they implicitly trust.  In high school my two Ex's started to experiment sexually with each other and they felt the safest place to do this was in MY bed. Feelings of safety and understanding go a long long long way.\n\nAnal: It's not for everyone.  Start on yourself.  Congratulations, God put your G-spot in your man-ass and it's easy to get to. She'll trust you more if you know what it feels like. Her anal spot is usually about 2.5 inches in and towards the Vagina. Or sometimes it's all about that first inch and stretching the opening. Small anal toys can be harder, larger toys should be softer. Bad Dragon is a great company. Don't put your fingers inside anyones anything unless you've filed the nails way down.  Buy an enema bag at Wallgreens(USA).\n\nIf you don't enjoy performing oral sex then you should probably learn to enjoy performing oral sex. As joe Rogan put it,  \"if you don't eat her ass, someone else will\".  I was surprised to learn that the strategy of tonguing the ABC's, like you are painting them with your tongue, actually works. It is said that you should start like a butterfly landing on a rose, and end like a champion at a pie eating contest.\n\nAnd of course, communicate.  It'd hard to talk about the weird stuff you are into.  But your partner might have their own weird stuff and it may work out great.\n\nNever forget the Lord loves a working man, see a doctor and get rid of it, and don't trust whitey.  /s.\n\nEDIT: The joke at the end is from The Jerk.  A Classic Steve Martin movie.  And I'm very white.  I just like to tag this onto all advice that I give.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHo88cj3eAc",

            "text": "At this moment I have three partners and 3-5 additional friends with benefits (all female), so I've received a lot of feedback in the last years. It's 'ethical non-monogamy' so they are aware of each other. Three of these people told me it's their best sex ever. What I list is specific feedback towards me, from specific people and I'm aware it shouldn't be generalized. But here's my five cents... things that work for me or that I've learned:\n\nBefore sex:\n\n1. Talk about your desires and fantasies. I've been quite surprised about how shameless, straightforward openness works like a red carpet for amazing sex. You won't match fully, but at least you know where and with what. And you pave a way to talk about techniques and during awkward moments.\n2. Zero pressure. Most sex partners told me that a major factor in their decision to continue having sex is that they feel very respected when they state their boundaries and that they feel no pressure or expectations to do things that they are not comfortable with.\n3. Safer sex talk. Tell them when you got tested last, for what, and what your safer sex practices are. They will answer with theirs. If they don't, I see it as a red flag. \n4. Use your own body to test how things feel and experiment with their point of view. Have you ever choked yourself? Which hand position feels best? How does it feel to be dominated and what exactly is nice about that? Which kind of touch feels good from your face to your feet?\n5. Extend this line of thought to ejaculation. Would you want to be warned or asked before someone cums inside you (even with a condom) or on your face?\n\nDuring sex:\n\nIt's incredibly simple. 1-6 are basics and in my opinion enough for great sex. \n\n1. Give. I focus on giving pleasure instead of receiving and it makes me feel equally satisfied.\n2. Check-in with them multiple times. Ask for consent for everything you do at least once.\n3. Focus on foreplay and non-penetrative sex first. I generally don't think about penetration until she at least came once.\n4. Listen and ask. Every-body is different. Ask what she likes. In detail.\n5. Say what you like and don't be afraid to say 'this is not working for me' if a technique she's trying doesn't do it for you. (I still struggle with this.)\n6. Feel the vibe between you and not only your needs.\n7. Oral: I used to flick my tongue around down there without really knowing what I was doing. I learned that when I rest my lips around the hood of the clit and touch it with the back of my tongue at least as much as with the front, things get more interesting.  Adding a finger or two inside, palm upwards has resulted in 95% of the cases in a (rather fast) orgasm for her. Listen to her breathing and moaning. Don't speed up when she gives positive feedback.\n8. Don't stop after she had an orgasm. Fingering with pressure to the pelvic bone, which is clit stimulation from the inside (previously called G-spot) works particularly well at that moment. Middle and ring finger ü§òwhile I sit next her, made all of my partners squirt.\n9. Grab hair by the root and not at the end.\n10. Try to edge together.\n11. Talk about the pelvic floor. I've introduced some people to theirs and things got so much better. \n12. Take your time to get used to someone's body. Someone that was totally not my type ended up being one of my most satisfying sex partners ever.",

            "text": "Some general advice:\n\n- no piece of advice applies to all women. These are just guidelines that should be applicable to most folks, but communication is key (as I'll explain later).\n\n- hygiene: goes without saying. Keep it clean. \n\n- keep your nails short. If you forgot this until the last moment, clip them and run the edges on your jeans to dull them a little. No one wants to get fingered by Scary Terry, bitch.\n\n- orgasms are not always required. Obviously they're great, but if either you or your partner doesn't finish after you've given it the good old college try, don't get down on yourself about it. Sex should be fun even before the orgasm. Put her pleasure above yours and she'll probably take care of you.\n\n- use protection. Yes, it feels better without it, but let me tell you what doesn't feel good: child support payments. Chlamydia. Full-blown AIDS. Or at least I assume they don't, because I've never experienced any of those things. Because I use protection. When used correctly, condoms are 98% effective at preventing pregnancy according to the knockout blurb Google gave me when I searched \"condom effectiveness\". Look up a YouTube video if you're not sure if you're using them 100% correctly. And I don't care how strong you think your pull-out game is, entrusting a horny dude with the task of not ejaculating inside a woman that's saying \"fuck me harder, baby\" (like your partners will be once you're done reading this guide) is dumber than sending a kid to the Jared Fogle Summer Camp (that was a real thing, look it up). And get tested after each new partner, just in case. Can't be too careful.\n\n- don't masturbate with too tight a grip! You'll kill the sensitivity in your dick. Use a loose-but-firm grip and lubricate yourself. If you've already been doing this, switch to the aforementioned technique, no exceptions. If you find that doesn't get you off, well, too bad. You don't get to finish until you can finish like that, because otherwise you'll be in the unenviable position of not being able to finish while fucking. And then she'll get self-conscious, you'll be embarrassed, it'll be awful. Beware the death grip.\n\n- pee after you finish. It's even more important for women, but it goes a long way toward preventing urinary tract infections.\n\n- make some *NOOOOOOISE!* Probably. Most women tend to like it when you're vocal. Don't go overboard - grunting like a warthog (like a lot of porn stars seem to do) is probably too much. But let her know you're enjoying yourself! Tell her how good her hand/mouth/pussy/ass feels, how much you love her tits/ass/legs/pussy, etc. Unless she's not into dirty talk, which is fine too.\n\n- don't be embarrassed. Not getting it up happens. Shooting your load too soon happens. Farts, queefs, armpit-fart-noises-because-your-skin-was-suctioned-to-hers - it happens. Get used to it. Laugh about it. Enjoy yourself.\n\nOkay.\n\n1\\. Communication. \n\nThis is super-important. The most important. It turns out that it's much easier to do stuff she likes when you know what it is because she told you. You can work it into talking dirty, too - if you try a particular rhythm and she reacts positively, ask her if she likes that (as suggestively as you feel comfortable with). If she says \"harder\", go harder. But! If she says \"don't stop\" or \"right there\", keep doing *exactly what you're doing*. Same angle, pace, intensity, whatever. Conversely, if she's doing something that doesn't work for you, gently tell her so. It's better to correct that kind of thing early than reinforce something that doesn't do it for you (this is why faking orgasms is bad). And if they do something you love, make sure to let them know that too. If there's an opportunity to tactfully and respectfully ask some questions beforehand, do that. Is she into dirty talk? Spanking? Hair-pulling? Does she like her breasts/nipples played with? These are all things that a lot of people do like, but some people find distasteful, and you shouldn't spring them on someone without asking first. Communicate before, during, and after sex. Can't stress this enough. \n\n2\\. Foreplay\n\nGuys, by and large, are simple. If a sexual partner touches me on the penis with some lubrication, I'm happy. It feels good. Easy as that. Women are generally more complicated. Even if you've got lube on your dick, you can't just go shoving it in there (unless she specifically asks for that, in which case she's probably got the lubrication covered so go for it!) without a bit of prep. Set the oven preheatin' before you put the meat in. This can start long before the bedroom - sexting, talking dirty, the occasional touch or smack on the ass (depending on what she's comfortable with) throughout the day are things that can start her motor running long before you get in the car (not my finest metaphor but let's move on). Once you're about to get down, put your hands on her, tell her how sexy she is and how much she turns you on, how badly you want her. A lot of kissing is good, on the mouth, neck, breasts, stomach - see the direction I'm moving here?\n\n3\\. Oral Sex\n\nGet good at this. Learn to love it if you don't already. The statistic I last heard was that only 25% of women can orgasm from penetration, so better to get take care of it sooner than later. Not that this should be treated as a box to be checked off - enjoy the journey and it's that much more likely that she'll reach the destination. As for technique:\n\n- don't neglect the clit. That's the little nub at the top of the vagina (it may be shrouded by the clitoral hood, you may want to gently pull it back - but extremely gently if at all! This may not be pleasurable for some women! It has nerves too, be careful), and it's the thing that would've become the penis if she'd have turned out to be a guy in the womb, so keep that in mind. Do you want someone mashing your dick around like they're a professional Smash Bros player and it's Final Destination, Fox only, no items? Hell no. So be gentle with it. Caress it. Massage it. If she tells you to go a little harder, err on the side of caution - genital pain is a turn-off for the majority of people, so just be cool, okay?\n\n- don't neglect not-the-clit. Remember the thing you're trying to get your wang wet with? The hole that's your goal? Give that a little love too. Lick it from top to bottom once in a while. Get a finger in there and curl it toward yourself in a beckoning motion, like you're requesting that her orgasm come hither. If you feel a spot that's rougher in texture than the rest, make that your focus - that's the G-spot, and guys' equivalent is the prostate (which is a major pleasure centre). Again, pay attention to the lady. If she likes something, do it more. If she doesn't, try something else. \n\n- enjoy yourself and enjoy her body. Your free hands - or just hand, if you've boarded the S.S. Fingerbang Ferry - should be roaming around her body, playing with her nipples if she's into that, just exploring her. If your jaw or tongue are getting sore, tag in your fingers and kiss the inside of her thighs, her stomach, etc. \n\n \n\n4\\. Penetration\n\nIt's time for the train to enter the proverbial tunnel. Maybe your partner just had an earth-shattering orgasm from your twisting tongue technique, or maybe she pulls you up off your knees because she needs cock inside her right that second. Or maybe neither of those things happened. Whatever. Point is, she wants your penis in her vagina. If she isn't sufficiently wet, put some lube on your tube. If you're unsure of positioning (which is okay), let her guide you in. It's probably going to feel pretty good. If it feels so good that you finish right away, don't panic. Come clean (no pun intended) and maybe go back to eating her out or fingering, that usually more than makes up for it if you know what you're doing (which by now I've done all in my power to ensure that you do). Do Kegels every day if that's a common problem for you, masturbate an hour or two before sex, whatever it takes. If you have the opposite problem, don't worry too much - it might just be a temporary mental block, and if not they've got little blue pills for that. Anyway. Throughout the fucking, keep kissing her, touching her, etc. Get your hand down to her clit if it's not too sensitive (which you will know by asking her). Try a few different positions. Have some fun! Starting off with long, slow thrusts and then crescendoing isn't a bad idea. But different strokes for different folks, pun intended. The reason you want to get her off first is because if she's among the 75% that doesn't orgasm from penetration, you've at least done your best to see to her first and now you can have your fun. If you're using a condom (which you should be), finish wherever; ask before you finish on her ass/back/breasts/face (contrary to what porn would have you believe, sex does not have to end with a facial). After you've finished:\n\n5\\. Aftercare\n\nCuddles. Most people love them, I find. Spoon that lady. She just let you put your dong all up in her biz, the least you could do is give her a little affection afterward. If it's uncomfortably hot and sweaty, feel free to take a second to cool down a bit before you do this. Maybe take a pee break (UTIs are a drag, or so I hear). If you had fun, tell her so. Maybe don't ask if she finished. It can kind of come off as insecure, or like you're looking for some sort of macho validation. Which I guess is also just insecurity. Just snuggle up, play with her hair, maybe kiss her neck just a bit. Unless this isn't that kind of sex. That might come off a bit clingy if this is just some girl from the club. Did I mention that not all advice applies to all people?\n\nAnyway, I hope that's ‚Äãenough to get you started. If you have questions about anything specific, fire away, I like talking about sex. Good luck and have fun!",

If you struggle with rhythm, try putting on music with decent bass.\n\n\nIf she starts breathing hard, twisting around, or especially says \"I'm close\", change nothing! Changing things at this point can be very effective, but it's also complicated, and usually requires a good amount of communication. If you are looking for sex tips, start there: change nothing when she is close.\n\n\nTry to focus on your partner, exclusively. Many people are hyper aware during sex. They can tell if you aren't really paying attention. It's not a good feeling.\n\n\nIf you are self-conscious about finishing fast, find out what you need to get to round 2 (protein shake? Cuddling?) And talk about this with your partner. Many women *like* the idea that they can make their partner finish fast. They also like to finish as well. The simplest solution here is to have sex twice. If you struggle to have sex twice in a short time period, keep in mind that penis-in-vagina sex is often the worst way to help a woman finish. Learn to give good head.\n\n\nStop being self-conscious about your dick. There really are cons to a big dick, and pros to a small one. And the only reason to really care about it's size is because of how it affects your partner. Your pleasure has nothing to do with your size. Even if you have a micro-dick, seriously, stop worrying. Your best bets to helping a woman finish are, in order, your words, your tongue, your hands, then your dick. You can learn to use all four better. You can't make your dick bigger. If none of that can help you stop fussing about it, consider that confidence is itself attractive. Even being self-depricating about your dick (which is still healthier than most people's relationship with their dick) is not confident behavior.\n\n\nA lot of this read as \"chase your partners pleasure more than your own\". Keep in mind that they should be doing the same thing! If you feel like your partner doesn't care about your pleasure, talk about it! Guys can also have bad sex.\n\n\nThe single best tip for sex is often the hardest, due to how we tend to treat sex: communicate!",

Be comfortable in your skin. \n3. Laughter and Kindness are better aphrodisiacs than an extra inch of penis, and wayyyyy better aphrodisiacs than talking about your penis.  Unless she explicitly expresses an interest in your dick; then you can go ahead and talk about the D.\n4. Good manners go a LONG way.  I can't tell you how many times women have mistaken my politeness for interest.  Be polite.  Have a conversation that is not about sex or dating. Look them in the eye.  Treat women as people.  Seriously guys, we need to be better in this department.  Be polite and gentlemanly, and not in a knight in armor kind of way.  Don't do it so you get accolades and attention.  Do it because it's the right thing to do. And as a nice side effect, you'll get more chances with the ladies.  But don't let that be the reason you do it.  Let it be the cherry on top.  But first, be a decent man.\n5. Lastly, understand and appreciate that women want sex too.  Sometimes more than we do.",

            "text": "Okay this won‚Äôt get much vision I‚Äôm sure, but if you‚Äôre already comfortable with your partner and they are comfortable with you then this position usually helps facilitate female orgasms (in my limited male experience with multiple partners). I don‚Äôt know the name of this position despite many searches so if anybody knows please share. I‚Äôd also like to preface by saying that I by no means am an expert or know better than females, it‚Äôs just that in my experience I‚Äôve had partners squirt and orgasm in this position very often. Some of which have never squirted before. \n\nPrerequisites:\n\nFirst, you have to know how THEY like their clitoris stimulated. Not all women like it the same. Once you know that, then this position puts in work. \n\nSecond, as if it hasn‚Äôt been said enough, foreplay foreplay foreplay. \n\nThird, I find this works well either half way through sex or towards the end. \n\nThe position:\n\nAt some point, transition onto your back and and have your partner laying on top of you with her back. This is easier to do if you‚Äôre already inside of her. For example, if she‚Äôs reverse cowgirl or you‚Äôre in a side cuddle position. \n\nDepending on the height difference, her head should be close to your head as you both look up towards the ceiling. She shouldn‚Äôt be trying to support herself with her arms and should just be laying on top of you. \n\nPut your legs on the inside of her legs and plant your feet on the bed so that your knees are up. Use your legs / knee area to keep her legs open if she ends up squeezing them more closed out of pleasure. Her knees should be up as well. \n\nPut both of your hands on her hips / small of her back and raise her slightly so that you have enough room to thrust. The first part of this position allows your penis to be angled more upwards and closer to her g spot rather than pushing back towards her uterus. Consistency with thrusting is key as it‚Äôs better to be consistent and ask your partner what she likes rather than try and go to pound town. If she‚Äôs into that then by all means do it. \n\nAs you get into the rhythm, you can take a hand and rub her clitoris how she likes it. In between thrusting, you can also grab her chest with your other hand. Remember, it‚Äôs not all about pushing your penis on and out of her. Keep your penis in and let her arch her back while you play with her. \n\nAlternate between thrusting and playing, and if you‚Äôre deft enough you can do both. \n\nThis is one of my favorite positions for pleasuring a partner and gets 9/10 of previous partners‚Äô approval.",

            "text": "One thing I've yet to see is noise. Women like sounds. A lot of them when watching porn get off more on the sounds made than what they see. Let's face it, sex from most women's point of view isn't gorgeous. Don't be silent and creepy. Get into it a bit. I'm not saying scream or take it over the top, but there's got to be more than just heavy breathing. \n\nGet her off first. The clit is sensitive, so getting her off before penetration preps her to keep getting off through sex. It also eases your anxiety, which will help you perform better. Noises still apply, while you're rubbing her down there don't be silent. Give her something to think about while she's got her eyes closed going into ecstacy. \n\nDon't finger her vagina hard. I've not met many chicks that are in to hard core riley reid style fingering. That doesn't mean just rub the clit, the whole area is sensitive, but definitely focus on the clit. Make sure your hands are clean and nails cut before you do anything to her. The last thing you want is to cause discomfort down there, it's 10 times worse than if you hurt her arm. \n\nPussy eating was well covered by the gentleman who mentioned butterflies and bulldogs. \n\nCommunication was also well covered. Don't ask a ton of questions during sex, but make sure you aren't doing things she doesn't like.\n\nBe selfless. You can get off whenever you like. It'll feel so much better if you are patient. And it'll help you build stamina. If you have to stop and calm down, do it. Tell her she's so hot and you don't want to cum yet, then rub her or massage her. Trust me, she will dig it. The anticipation is huge, as they can't just beat one out. \n\nEye contact is good, but don't go over the top. Think about your facial expressions and what she is seeing. If you're bug eyed and locked into her gaze, it's creepy. Same goes for giving her a double chinned gaze. Being manicured and clean definitely helps. \n\nSet the mood. Music can be huge. Think of songs that make you a bit horny. Lofi beats are also good. Drowning out the rest of life so you can focus on each other and be present is huge. Also, clean your damn sheets. Nobody wants to fuck on a dirty ass bed. \n\nHygiene, though covered on this thread, will be repeated. Clean your stinky ass. Smell nice. Remember that there's 5 senses. Stimulate all of them. \n\nTalk before sex. Let her get her worries and frustrations out before you do the deed. She'll have a clear mind. If she's thinking about work or chores or her family, it won't make her in the mood for sexy time. Better yet, do some dishes and clean. Women love men with dishpan hands. It shows you care, which is sexy to her. \n\nSome women like aggressive sex, others like sensual smooth sex. It takes time to figure out what she likes. And that's okay. It's not always about the orgasm. I don't even cum every time anymore, and I'm fine with it because my goal is to be present, connected, close, and relaxed. \n\nRemember, it's more than just sex and orgasm. If you treat it as such, y'all will cum buckets. Massages, smells, touch, taste, sounds, feelings. It all comes into play. Treat it like it's the most amazing ride in life, because it is definitely one of the most amazing things about being alive. Cultivate relationships during sex, even a one night stand, and it leaves the partner longing for more.",

Even if she‚Äôs super wet naturally, it always helps to get her started and makes her cum faster.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if anyone needs to hear this but women are capable of having multiple orgasms during sex. When she cums it‚Äôs not over. You should give her a minute to savor it and get her shit together but she‚Äôs probably not done yet. So don‚Äôt think you have to be close to being done or have to finish when she does, although it is awesome if she likes it when you cum in her.\n\nThis last one is pure speculation so take this with a grain of salt and probably not real advice‚Ä¶\nI have only had sex with 3 women my whole life. All of them were long term relationships. The last one I have been with for over 10 years and we are happily married. All three of them were squirters. Not the spray the wall shit in porn, but actually spasms with pussy juice gushing all over the place. The common denominator is very simple, it always happened while they were riding on top while I was gently rubbing their clit. When I felt their pussy grip a little tighter I would increase the intensity of rubbing the clit. That‚Äôs it. I never ask about it because I don‚Äôt want my wife to even think about it nor do I want to create any pressure. I just love doing it to her because I can literally feel her pleasure. My theory is that they are having 2 different types of orgasms at the same time. It doesn‚Äôt happen every time, but it is common, especially when the mood is right. Dark room, loud music in the back ground, and no thinking. We both just let go and get lost in the moment. I don‚Äôt have a magic cock.",

Ask what she likes and doesn't like BEFORE getting into sex, too.\n\nLike a few other comments here, most women like consistent buildup, not changing what you're doing all the time. Be enthusiastic and show emotion, they usually like seeing what they're doing to you, too, don't deadpan stare at them(or anyone really lol). Take interest in their pleasure and yours will come, being a selfish lover isn't good. Unless she's into being dominated or stuff like that, they probably don't appreciate being used like a fleshlight.\n\nGuys interested in experimenting with other guys, be safe. Just because we generally can't get pregnant, wear condoms, unless you're absolutely sure everyone is clean. Beyond that, be casual, you're a guy, too, you know what we're like. Also, you know how to please a man naturally, since you're also a man.\n\nOh! Whoever you're with, or by yourself, experiment with your prostate, it's the male g spot and feels incredible. It may even be overwhelming at first, but doing kegels/prostate stimulation, it'll make your orgasm crazy. Just use a lot of lube, especially if you're new to it. You think it's enough lube, get more, and go slow. If you find a woman that'll play with your ass, rimming/fingering/etc, treasure her. Women that are into guys like that are fucking heroes to this gay guy.\n\nLastly, fucking clean yourself before doing the sex. Finger yourself in the shower and rinse well if you're doing anal, minimum, though enemas are better. Unlike douching, you can generally enema often and safely.

It doesn‚Äôt just involve body parts and the sight of genitalia like it can for guys. It‚Äôs about the surroundings, the mood, the sensations, the chores you did that week (seriously), the acts of care and consideration you‚Äôve done in advance of everything. Then, when it does finally get to body parts, it‚Äôs much more than just genitalia. It could be an earlobe, kisses on the neck, a brush of her knee and it‚Äôs usually multiple parts and ways of touch. Also, every woman is different and it‚Äôs good to ask what they like. In fact, it‚Äôs good to communicate in general. Don‚Äôt be afraid of asking if they want something a certain way. Just don‚Äôt come off too needy or uncertain of yourself. It‚Äôs like when you encounter a bear, they sense the fear and lack of confidence. \n\nTo summarize, learn that the sensations and sights and sounds are much different and far more complex for a woman than a man.

When fingering, those fingers **SHOULD NOT BE DRY!!!** Do whatever it takes to moisten your fingers before reaching down there. A vulva has a mucus membrane. Its not meant to be dry!\n\n2. Incorporating toys will definitely improve things for both of you. You should see how girls faces light up when I've suggested to bring out a vibrator. And honestly, it takes a lot of pressure off of you. Most girls know how to get off using their toys, so why not let her show you? And most of these toys can feel great for the guy too.\n\n3. When you think you're getting too close to the edge and are about to finish, really focus on your breathing, and begin taking long, slow, and deep breaths. Most guys tend to start taking quick, shallow breaths as they reach climax, which signals to the brain that the end is coming. Switching your breathing helps avoids this, and also helps you shift your focus away from the impending orgasm, which helps extend the length one can last",

I have next to zero confidence in my bedroom skills beyond that, but the alphabet trick has knocked it out of the park for me without fail.\n\nEdit: Also, I'm sure someone else has already mentioned it in this thread, but no matter what you're doing, if she says \"Don't stop,\" then DO NOT stop!

Just like that\", it literally means **JUST LIKE THAT,** do not change anything.\n* She is as if not hornier than you are: Take that bloody stupid image of the man who is obsessed with sex and the woman who uses it to control him. That is mostly bollocks. Different people have different sex drives, some high, some low, some average. Finding someone you're comfortable with is far more important. Also, men are allowed to not be in the mood for sex, it doesn't make your cock any smaller.\n* Have constant reminders: Intimacy and love are not switches, they're more like glasses that you're continuously filling and draining. In the sense that you can't expect both of you to be at the same level all the time. What does help is giving each other small reminders throughout the days that you both are too busy. Give her a hug that includes a breast fondle, nibble her ear while she is cooking, slap her bum while she carries the laundry, send her a flirty message at lunch. This will create anticipation and need in a more healthy way.\n* Apart from complimenting her tits and arse which is all well and good. Trying and find other things she does that you find cute or attractive. For me, I dated this lass who had the cutest chubbiest cheeks and would constantly compliment them, and she did eventually tell me that it was one of the things that she loved the most about our relationship.\n* All women are different... No, really, they are. There is no playbook, there is no secret ancient mythic Tibetan art for tonguing a clit. Something that drove your ex-mad, might leave your current squeeze dry as a fatman's plate. Communication and honesty are way more important.\n* Always good to have a wee chat with your partner about consent and how far you're each willing to go when it comes to any rough stuff, as fun as it is, it can get out of hand.\n\nAnd that's it, I could probably come up with more, but these were the first that popped into my head. I'd say that the last thing is to have fun, enjoy your partner, let yourself be enjoyed, etc...  \n\n\nFinally, Hail Yourself, Hail Satan  \n\n\nEdit: Typos, clarity and forgot the Hail Satan.",

Even if you‚Äôre not concerned about whether or not it‚Äôs ‚Äúgay,‚Äù there‚Äôs a lot of vulnerability and feelings of submission that come with playing with your ass, and even more so having someone else play with your ass. As men we have been taught our whole lives that we have to be dominant in all situations, and that ‚Äútaking it in the ass‚Äù is the absolute worst thing we can do. The stupid thing about this notion is that it denies us of some of the greatest pleasure we can attain for literally no benefit. \n\nStart out very gently by yourself in The shower and get a lubed finger into your ass (body wash works). Then squeeze your ass as hard as you can and then relax. Do this a few more times until you‚Äôre comfortable with the relax part. Thats the key. Anal is all about being able to relax your sphincter. Then start to work your finger in and out and jerk yourself off until you cum.\n\nYou‚Äôll never be the same again lol",

When fingering her, slowly pull your fingers up until you feel the bump. Or, simply ask. The vaginal canal is about an inch up from dead center, between front and back. If you can kinda maneuver your dick while hard, try and aim for it without your hands. With my own experience, if I slip out, I can just as easily slip back in. If you have a longer dick, say, longer than 7 inches or so, going balls deep every thrust will hurt. Unless she's a masochist or truly doesn't feel the pain of *her cervix being bashed every second* don't do that. It's painful for her and, in my experience, uncomfortable. The g-spot is about an inch or so inside and on top. That rough spongy spot that's kinda a bump? Make a \"come here\" motion with your fingers. Or just hold them still and go in and out. For anal, if she isn't used to it, you gotta train it slowly. And I mean it about training, and slowly. Look up some training tips online. Remember, only do it if she wants to.",

Tell her that.   It will get her to relax and she'll have a better time not worrying about \"that\".\n2. Before you start, talk to her and let her know that if she wants you to stop just say so.  After too much time, women can get sore.   Tell her you don't want to make her uncomfortable.\n3. Tell her that if you do something that she's not ok with to just let you know and you'll stop.\n4. Ask her if there is anything she especially likes.   If she doesn't have anything specific ask her if she'd like a finger massaging her g-spot.   If she doesn't know about that then you get to try it on her.   If you don't know then you haven't done your homework on reseaching the G spot.   this is important for you to know.\n5. Forget that advice about doing the alphabet.   it's not important.   Some women enjoy some pressure (after a while) on their clit to make them cum.    ANd don't be surprised if, when they cum, they ejaculate (squirt).   It's a wonderful thing when a woman squirts their cum in your face.   lap it up.  it's delicious !",

Feeling physically adored can sometimes allow a woman to remove the shackles of self consciousness, which also helps create a safe space for opening/orgasms.  How can someone orgasm if they're focused on how a belly roll looks or something like that.  \n\nCommunication helps, but I let communication take it's natural time.  You don't have to spell out all your kinks and desires straight away.  Sex doesn't need to be some transactional exchange of fulfilling each other's desires in the name of openness and being a good partner.  Some people open like flowers rather than books.  Sometimes physical intuition is the best to learn a partner's body and finding/developing the connection between two people. \n\nThis may sound a bit woo woo but I think those ingredients made my partner go from not being able to have PIV orgasms with anyone ever to being able to have many of them every time we have sex.   \n\nFinally, you have to be in touch with your own body and own desires.  If there's shame hidden away, maybe see a therapist.  \n\nMore basic mechanical stuff that often happens:   \n\nI let a my partner ride my face for a long time and while doing so I jerk off to the view of her body on top of mine.  We're both thoroughly satisfied and that usually gets at least a few orgasms.  By the time we're done there's a burning desire to fill and be filled.  \n\nI used to be obsessed with porn, and would edge myself for hours.  Apparently this skill comes in quite handy.  The sexual energy grows for both of us during sex, but right when I'm about to finish I hold everything back while she goes over the edge.  I use all my concentration to stop myself, and after about a minute I can start going again.  The orgasms then come easier and easier for her.  Eventually I finish when her vaginal muscles are able to overcome my withholding, or I just feel like gushing, but this can be after A LOT of orgasms, almost continually for her sometimes.  \n\nAlso, we get pretty stoned on weed and I think this allows us to bypass the thinking side of the brain and just be in the moment.

Not like right before it, but earlier in the day, maybe as part of getting ready.  This way you‚Äôll likely last longer if you have sex.\n\n2. If you‚Äôre having sex, concentrate more on your breathing.  Don‚Äôt think about how good it feels or how hot she is, just think about and focus on breathing and slow your breathing down a bit.\n\n3.  If you‚Äôre having sex and feel like you‚Äôre getting there, slow down, even stop for a few seconds to kiss her, either on the lips or the neck or where ever else she might like.\n\n4.  If you‚Äôre having sex and feel like you‚Äôre getting there, slow down and then change positions and while changing positions do so kind of controlled and slowly, kiss and fondle her while changing positions.

So if she says something like ‚Äúmost guys I‚Äôm with have 8 inches or so‚Äù it‚Äôs probably 5 to 6 inches and she got it wrong or she‚Äôs been around the local horse farm a couple times. I‚Äôm more inclined to think the former though. Hope this helps.",

Playing with a woman's inner labia, especially the clitoral legs while gently exploring the vaginal opening, can make your woman cry she came so hard. The clit can be easily over stimulated, think the head of your cock after you came. You can get there, and understanding how your woman likes her clit to be touched is the key to giving her an orgasm,  but you don't want to immediately start heavily rubbing the clit because you are so proud you know where it is. If she says yes that, don't go faster or harder because you think she is about to come and you are taking it to the next level, do exactly what she asks you to keep doing. \n\nLearn where the g spot is (it feels like spongy corduroy or the ridges on very soft cardboard just inside the vaginal opening on the top (think if the clit extended back like it was the head of a dick and the clit is that place on the underside of the head that feels amazing) and learn to gently caress it.\n\n Fingerbanging or fingerblasting is one of those things from porn that rarely works the same way and makes dudes think they are doing way better than they actually are. When it does work like that, it is after she is the kind of turned on where your forearms are wet. \n\nSeriously, do some research on the female anatomy. Did you know the clitoris has legs? Being good in bed is hard and it takes work. Think of how long it takes to master the violin, now tell me genitals aren't as complicated. There is nothing manly about being terrible in bed, do the research, maybe take a workshop. They are all online now, shebop, cannasexual,  Luna Matattas has great stuff. The point is, find a class and learn like you would any other skill.\n\nAsk what your woman wants. If she doesn't know, you have gotta help her and encourage her to explore alone or with you. \n\nEnjoy",

Much of foreplay is really about getting a woman mentally prepared. The reality is you are not making her cum... she is using you to cum (aka if she says to keep doing something keep doing it rather than speeding up or using more force etc). Creating that environment is what you are really trying to do. \n2. **Be someone that a woman would want to have sex with.** Clean (already mentioned a bunch) is important... but don't forget to stay in shape! Be confident. Be interesting. Be the whole damn package. \n3. **Be in control of your body.** Make sure your lower abdomen is relaxed. Foreplay is great to slow you down so you can keep control.

It's mortifying for everyone involved, but it doesn't have to be something that carries on to the rest of your encounter or sours what's already happened.\n\nContinuing on gay-specific advice:\n\n**Tops***: Be attentive of your partner.

Take it slow, see what hits them just right, and you'll both have a blast.\n\n**Bottoms**: If you douche, give it a little bit of time before you jump into sex; you want to make sure that water has time to be absorbed into your body or to make its way down for you to expel.

Stop telling yourself, \"Oh man, I gotta get hard otherwise she is going to think I'm bad in bed.\"\n\nSometimes you fuck like a pornstar. Sometimes you fuck like a virgin. Read your horoscope.\n\nSpectating the situation will throw a wrench in everything and in my case will give you an ED problem that'll be hard to shake.\n\nWhen I started saying, \"Fuck it. She gets what I want to give,\" and stopped being ashamed of having to stop in the middle or going limp all of a sudden, suddenly I started working again.\n\nI hear a lot of guys say, \"I like to make my partner cum otherwise I don't get off.\" That's fine, but that's a lot of pressure to be putting on yourself. Dick's don't respond well to pressure (well at least mental pressure. Physical is a different story). Some girls are harder to make cum than others. Some girls won't tell you what will make them get off. Heck, some girls pride themselves in not being \"easily pleased\". Do your best, but if they can't get off, that's their problem, not yours.\n\nSo when you get floppy, do what YOU want to do, (respectfully of course). \n\nFor instance, I LOVE eating a woman out when she is in doggy style (assuming she's clean down there). I have a thing for asses. So if I'm on top in missionary doing my thing and my arms get tired and in my head I stop enjoying it as much causing me to get limp I say to myself, \"Tough shit for her if she likes this because right now I'm tired as fuck. She can deal.\" Then I pull out, flip her around, pull up her hips, and start going to town on her orally.\n\nSure as shit I'm so focused on enjoying eating her out that (and not having my arms screaming at me) that I get rock hard again and can go back to town! And you know what? If I don't get erect again, I'll eat her out till my tongue gets tired. And if it isn't good enough for her, tough shit.\n\n**TL;DR ‚Äì If you go limp, stop spectating your dick and do what you like instead of trying to make her cum. That shit will happen on its own.**",

It has to be rhythmic, have an intensity you both enjoy, and you *know* when you‚Äôre playing an instrument properly. If you ever try to pick up a new instrument, like a guitar, and try something crazy and complex you don‚Äôt understand, like a Jimmy Page solo, chances are you know if you‚Äôre gonna sound like absolute garbage and the experience you get from it won‚Äôt be too different. You touch the instrument in way that sounds beautiful and you know you‚Äôre doing a good job, then it feels good. It‚Äôs an art, a practice, and it takes time to get good at it, and you‚Äôll know when you‚Äôre good at it. I can think of countless musicians and men that think they‚Äôre are better on stage/in the sack than they really are and those are the types that lie to themselves. Don‚Äôt be like that, you know when your sound/perform well. When you touch in way that sounds good, you‚Äôll know how to keep getting better and you‚Äôll love it along the way.",

Not enough can be said for foreplay: my girl likes to sit on my face(and I enjoy this probably as much or more than her) for a while before hitting 69 for a while.  I will likely start with the girlfriend on the bed, naked, and start a sensual massage.  There isn't always time, but even a little massage action will score serious points with your SO.  Back to foreplay.  Once she's getting to the point of begging to have me in her, we switch over to intercourse.  Sometimes I just push her back on the bed and keep giving her clit and vagina more attention.  Tongue, fingers busy, don't forget she has nipples, too.  Haven't had any complaints, yet, and my girl knows I'm orally fixated.\n\nSo, after foreplay, put the lady in cowgirl.  Your objective is a little \"button\" which is usually situated at the back of the vagina, on the left side(facing her).  I've never encountered the \"button\" on the right side, but it's possible, as all women are different.  Anyway, your partner should roll her hips forward, pushing you as deep as she can take.  This motion is for her clit to be mashed into your pelvis.  If you're a husky guy, slip a finger down to massage her clit in time with her hip movement.  At some point you should be able to hit her g-spot(the \"button\").  If she hasn't been with a guy who could do this to her, she may stop suddenly, wondering what that spot is.  Either way, continue at *her* pace; let her set the rhythm.  If you're hitting that spot on every 2nd or 3rd hip-movement, you are doing well.  Don't forget she still has more erogenous zones you can hit: play with her breasts, using your mouth and fingers.  Don't also forget she has a big erogenous zone on her neck.  Much like guys, if you can find her special spot on her neck, she will go wild.  (I know where my \"spot\" is on my neck, but it is much better when I let my SO find it on her own; it gives her a sense of accomplishment, like, \"I found the spot that makes my guy go nuts,\" and, really, only 2 other women have bothered to find my spot, so it really is an accomplishment)\n\nAnyway,  keep going until she hits climax.  If she isn't feeling it, switch over to doggy.  Make sure you have her legs running outside yours.  If her legs are together, there's a *lot* more sensation for the guy.  Start slow, as this is very deep penetration(yes, there are different positions, this is just the easiest).  Keep the rhythm set to her liking: you're trying to please her, not be a one pump chump.  Let her set the time, and go with the flow.  Slowly she will build, and everything will get faster.  If she has an orgasm, try to stay in her while it happens: her entire vagina will squeeze, and it is highly likely your dick will be expelled, but the squeezing feeling is awesome. \n\nFor the whole session, your point is to take care of her every need.  If you have an awesome girlfriend/wife, she will be doing the exact same thing: looking after your pleasure.  There are women who have never had an orgasm outside of masturbation.  If/when you give your SO her first, it's a moment you can look back on fondly.  Whether she gets all quiet or is rendered into a slapping screaming mess, it's an incredible experience you should be cognizant of, recognize, and take appropriate action: cuddling, calling a break, etc.  Let her process the event.  If it is \"just\" your first orgasm with her, treat it like an event anyway.  Don't just roll off the bed and go clean up: cuddle with her, bask in the afterglow.",

Taking care of each other.\n\nOtherwise you're just masturbating with and into a partner. Which is fine. But we asked for great, right?",

It's important to last enough for your partner to finish but it's also important that you finish at all and get to enjoy it.\n\n2: Maybe this is not usually the case for men, but if you are having sex with a woman: foreplay, always foreplay. Kiss for a while, then slowly take her and your clothes, go down on her, touch her, kiss her all over, let her guide you if you don't know what you're doing or don't know what SHE likes (every girl is different). Extend foreplay until she basically begs for it. THEN you're good to go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: Also... ALWAYS WEAR A CONDOM",

Preferences can vary depending on your partner yes, but in the meantime find a pace she enjoys and maintain it, don't speed up or slow down, if she's visibly enjoying it then keep doing exactly what you're doing, if you change the pace halfway or worse stop entirely she has to start again from square one. \n\n- A longer time doesn't always equal a better time.\n\nFairly self explanatory, not everyone wants to fuck for hours and it can get pretty uncomfortable for them after a long while so don't think that you need to keep it in for ages, just make sure they're happy and satisfied and if they've finished maybe try and finish soon after, if they want more they'll let you know once you've had a half time break. \n\n- Talk to each other\n\nNeither men nor women are clairvoyant, if you enjoy something she's doing tell her and encourage her to do the same so you can reciprocate. Tell her how gorgeous she is, make her feel wanted, be a little romantic or dirty depending what mood you're going for, but nobody should fuck in silence. \n\n- Have fun and enjoy it.\n\nSex can be awkward as fuck and nothing like porn, you'll fumble over each other, hit your head on the headboard, sometimes struggle to get clothing off, sweat a lot and be subject to more than a few questionable smells. Don't overthink anything and if something daft happens just roll with it, you're doing something intimate with someone you care about who are most likely finding the situation equally as nuts as you are, so if something stupid happens just laugh it off and keep going.",

If she likes to be touched somewhere, don't do it for 5 seconds and think your job is done, use your hands, fingers, lips, tongue on whatever area it is, go soft, take your time and see her reactions, draw it out. Anyone can thrust for a minute then take a nap, but it takes an artist to really take things to another level.\n\nAlso, don't worry about your size, how in shape you are, what you saw in a recent porn video, none of that matters, this is your sport, you make the rules and you work with what you have. \n\nIf at the end she's breathing normally, hasn't broken a sweat and you haven't had her grabbing your hair or digging her nails or teeth into you or she hasn't twisted her body likes she's possessed or made a noise that you absolutely know isn't fake because no one would choose that sound. Then you haven't done a decent job.\n\nJust remember that first point, it's not about you, if she hates 137 things and only likes to do 4 things, then it's your responsibility to be an absolute god at those 4 things. If she's only experienced vanilla because most guys don't know what to do in that situation, ignore what she wants, do what they want and end up doing 1 of those 4 things and not well. Then the effort you put into those 4 will freak her out and she will crave you like a drug.\n\nSo talk to her, find out what she likes and doesn't like, when you're together pay attention to her reactions to things, don't do what does work and if somethings working keep doing that EXACT THING, don't change it up, don't see that as a win and move on, keep doing that thing",

The AFE zone is located above the G-spot (which is located on the inner wall).  Stimulating the AFE zone helps with the production of cervical mucus.

            "text": "Sorry for the long post.  I just want to be sure and include things that took me a long time to figure out, so hopefully your good lovemaking journey will start off better than mine did as the majority of what I learned was by trial & error.  Just remember that slow & steady wins the race. \n\nMy tips will be from my experiences as a man with women, but they can also apply to anyone‚Äôs lovemaking.  I‚Äôm 50 now so this is based on approximately 30+ years of lovemaking. \n\nRemember to take your time and warm things up slowly but surely.  Some circumstances will dictate different but this is primarily for a longer lovemaking session.  Although you can also apply some of these tips to quickies for a bit of afternoon delight as well.\n\nBelieve it or not when it comes to foreplay, good, intelligent, and slightly naughty conversation is a good way to start things off.  Nothing too graphic initially, just teasing innuendos here & there.  Then slowly intensify the teasing until it‚Äôs time to make good on it.  Once it gets to the lovin‚Äô, touchin‚Äô, squeezin‚Äô, part, start off slow and tease with the lightest of kisses/caresses just in front of her ears, to her ear lobes, her neck just below her ears, and light caresses to her breasts and nipples with your free hand(s) while you do that.  This would also be a good time for some kissing, whether it be teasing kisses with little tongue licks to her lips and the corners of her mouth, or slow deep kisses.  You can also suck on her tongue if she likes that.  I personally like to lightly suck on her bottom lip a little sometimes too.\n\nWhen you do move down to her breasts, lightly kiss and lick everywhere BUT her nipples.  After you‚Äôve taken some quality time showing her breasts some attention, lightly graze her nipples with your lips and gently use your lips and tongue on her areoles and nipples.  You‚Äôll be surprised how hard her nipples will get and how much of a turn-on this can be.  Be sure and pay attention to her reactions and you‚Äôll know what she likes and you‚Äôll definitely know what she wants more of.  Some women like their nipples slowly sucked and rubbed while some other women like their nipples nibbled on and pulled & twisted.  Be sure you know because it will be a quick mood killer if you assume and you‚Äôre wrong. \n\nWhile you‚Äôre pleasuring her breasts, take your free hand or your mouth (whichever applies) and use steady pressure, whether it‚Äôs the tip of your tongue or the tip of your finger or pad of your finger on her lips (labia).  As you slowly work your way to her clit, continue to pay attention to how she reacts and then use gentle pressure and the tip/pad of your finger or tongue or even the flat part of your tongue to caress her clit in a slow circular or tiny up & down motion and also a combination of both.  You will definitely know by her reactions what she likes and if you pay attention to her body, her reactions, and what she tells you, you‚Äôll be a good lover and you will both enjoy your time together more.  You can also insert your finger, or two fingers, (palm facing up) and use them to rub her G-spot (read up on that) with one hand in a \"come here\" type motion while you stimulate her clit with your other hand or your tongue.  The G-spot is on the upper wall of the inside of the vagina if she's laying on her back, and a few inches in.  It's location varies a little from woman to woman.  Her reactions and what she tells you will be your best indicators as to where it's at.  Just remember that your mouth/tongue and both hands should all be busy at the same time.  You can't go wrong with that.   When things get properly warmed up, then you can move on to the next phase.  \n\nA pillow under her hips is definitely a tip I wish I knew earlier on as well.  \n\nGetting blowjobs is good, but when the other person is giving them, their head facing up and hanging off the side of the bed and you standing next to the bed is a REALLY good way to get one. \n\nIt took me way longer than it should have to figure all that out.\n\nOne last thing, be sure and don't take yourself too seriously.  Doing that will only cause undue stress on yourself and the whole situation, which in turn takes the enjoyment away from the experience for both of you.  \n\nEnjoy the moment.  \n\nHope that helps.",

All this can will help you form an experience satisfying for your partner.\n\nThe second tip2 is one I read years ago. Certain stimuli are more widely found attractive than others. Two that I have read about that work best for me, that I been told at times by my partners' that they like, and that others' body language has also confirmed are the following:\nA) Low pitch moans. My voice isn't super deep or bassy. But I let a couple of low \"mmmm\"s out with my exhale and invariably their response is... moaning, griping tighter, grabbing, more enthusiasm in general, etc.\nB) See tip 1 and 2A before trying this one. A hand on their neck/throat. No grip at first. Read their body language. A little squeeze, read them! Adjust as necessary. It's just a little play / move that gets a good response for me a lot. But someone's life experiences, comfort level, or just preferences could make this one not be a good move.",

Basically it is this: about 10 or so short thrusts, (not deep at all!) followed by a couple of deep ones. The gist of it is: you are building her up; kind of like piling on the orgasm. And you have to do it even though she wants you to fuck her deeply. You have take your time, never deviate from quick, quick, slow. 10 short thrusts into her. You can make those slowish, but never as deep.\n\n>And she is really going to try and fight it by trying to pull you into her, but you must retract so that she does not get all of you. Quick, quick slow. After a little bit, you feel her waiting for it. For the slow. You must continue and don't give in just yet. You feel her wanting for it, her breath will get heavier. She will be used to the rhythm, pacing herself to you. She'll get more into it. The tease, is what is driving her crazy. She will make sure to make every slow, counts. You must keep with the short strokes! After a little bit she will start to get to the edge and will probably start to orgasm at this point, it is here when you give it your all! When she starts to orgasm, Fuck. Her. Hard! Her body has been used to all of this teasing, and not all of you so that the little or maybe not so little orgasm that she was having, has now gone into motherfucking hyper drive! If you come, keep going! Try to keep going as long as you can hold out, so that she can have as many orgasms as she can!\n\n>And after you can go no more, just take a break man. You have done well. Cuddle.\n\n>EDIT:Spelling",

This will consistently deliver 9.9-11 for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, once you get good at this technique alone.... \n\nTry doing things with your partner. Give her lots of orgasms and fake your own each time along with her. It might take her getting some used to that there is a chorus each time. But you can make your last orgasm with her a real one for you and the two of you can lay there blissed out for 30 minutes.",

Communication is KEY to a good time in bed.\n\n2: For Herero Guys: Make her/them cum first, and if you‚Äôre a quick shot, get really good a using your hands and mouth, and try to get them off first, after that they shouldn‚Äôt care to much if you‚Äôre done in a few pumps.\n\n3. (Which also connects back to 1) Learn where your partners most erogenous zones are, are always learn where the G-Spot is for a male and female, and learn and practice on how to reach them and use those spots just right. Listen to them and what they‚Äôre saying, as some people will like being kissed on the neck, or having someone nuzzle their neck, and some like being gently caressed or lightly scratched, while some will like it if you just go nuts and finger blast them.\nNo. Person. Is. The. Same.\n\n4: Keep your fun parts, your ass, your hands, and your mouth clean if you are sure you are going to have sex. No women likes a UTI because your dick, or hands, were unwashed and crusted with filth. And ladies, just because it‚Äôs harder for a man to get a UTI, doesn‚Äôt mean you can expect a man to always want to stick it into a smelly or dirty vagina.\nNo one likes to have a persons face next to theirs when that persons breath smells of garlic. Brush your damn teeth, use mouth wash, and chew some gum if you‚Äôve eaten dinner before sexy times.\n\n5: and now ladies, gentlemen, and everyone in between, the most important rule of all. CONSENT! No means No, Stop means Stop. Not everyone is into domination play, which should always be discussed before hand, and trust established between all consenting participants. Safe words are meant to be respected and adhered too. Failure to stop when commanded, failure to respect a safe word, and failure to respect your partner will not only ruin trust, but can make you a rapist.\n\nTLDR: RESPECT, CONSENT, AND LISTENING MUST BE ADHERED TO, IF GOOD SEX IS WHAT YOU WANT.",

All I do is use a really nice soap in the shower and put on deodorant and nothing else. No cologne, no Ax spray or anything like that. Just a little soap and deodorant and my manly musky scent.\n\nAnd make sure you brush your teeth!

Use it on her clit while you fuck her. If she asks for it to use on herself, let her cuz she knows her spots better than anyone else. \n2. The motion you should be doing is not just simply in and out. Try and go from an angle where your cock is moving as much towards your own body as possible because the g spot is stimulated from those kinds of angles. You want to feel like youre pushing into and off of the part of her vag that is closest to you. A pillow under the lower back helps enable this. Them riding you helps them hit the angle too, but if youre particularly big it might hurt her more than you thing and they end up perching forward more than angling backwards.\n3. Slapping some bootycheeks is widely enjoyed whilst doggy or reverse cowgirl. Harder means harder, its pretty damn hard to slap a booty too hard when they say harder. \n4. A finger tip in the butthole is a +. If they push your hand away or say no thats fine, but the majority of women enjoy it as long as you dont go too deep. Really just to the first finger knuckle. \n5. Lubricant is a friend. Use lube especially if youre larger. Flavored is a +. \n6. The flat of your toungue is just as much if more enjoyable than the tip. They feel all the buds. \n7. Pinching the clit between two fingers helps, THEN do the rotations",

Some women can cum just from rubbing your dick against their clit, don't even need to be inside.\n\nChange the angle of approach to stretch them out. Overall changing of angles in different positions is good too.\n\nMoving your body slightly up past hers will make it easier to engage the clit while thrusting.\n\nNot all of these are going to work for everyone, but I usually try each one until I figure out what works.

Make out with her, rub her shoulders, grab her ass, hold her tight, tell her how amazing her skin feels, kiss the ears, run your fingers through her hair or anything else she likes. Work your way to playing with her clit or oral (think like 10-15 minutes total for all of this, even more if you end up eating her out). This makes for way better sex! When you get to the sex part she's already soaked and begging you to put it in. You have a better chance of making her cum and you won't have to rely only on your dick and hoping that does the trick and you both end up disappointed if you don't. It turns what may have been a 10-15 minute experience into double that. Also, if you want sex more often re-read this again. A back massage while listening to her about her stressful day? You're gettin' it in tonight! And, Jesus Christ, you guys don't know to wash your nuts? Why is that so highly commented? Since this may be the first time you've been told this, I'll be your big brother today and to tell you how: Go buy a wash cloth, a bar soap and some deodorant. Don't just put soap on your hands and wash your body, pits and crack, you need more than your hands. Use a wash cloth and a bar of soap! Buy some deodorant for your undercarriage and apply it post shower. A different brand than you use for your arms so you don't get them confused. There you go fellas! You got this!",

I‚Äôve got a great sex tip for y‚Äôall:\n\nAsking ‚Äúdo you want to have sex‚Äù is unlikely to result in a negative outcome. \n\nEither she says ‚Äúyes‚Äù and you have sex, or she says ‚Äúno‚Äù and you avoid a potential allegation of sexual assault. \n\nConsent is of utmost importance, and too many people think they‚Äôll ‚Äúspoil the moment‚Äù if they make the implied consent they think they‚Äôre seeing explicit through words.\n\nIf she ain‚Äôt into it, you want to know, and *fast* before you make a mistake, hurt someone, and potentially ruin your life. \n\nSo make double sure whoever you intend to have the sex with actually wants to have the sex with you. I‚Äôve been with the same person for over a decade, and every time we have the sex it starts off with ‚Äúyou wanna bang?‚Äù And we go from there. It‚Äôs crude, it‚Äôs vulgar, and it *fucking works*.

            "text": "This would be broad advice geared for predominantly heterosexual men of Reddit, who are perhaps a bit inexperienced or may have some misconceptions of what sex is because they grew up on TV, the internet and shit their buddies said.\n\n1) YOUR PENIS IS NOT MAGIC, no matter how much porn has told you otherwise. In fact it's probably the least effective part of your body at getting someone to climax. A compliment and a steady hand will do more in 5 mins than \"pounding away\" ever will (Not to say that pounding doesn't have it's place). Women don't give a shit about the size of your penis. Frankly the larger it is the less things are going to be on the table.\n\n2) Performance issues are way more common than most men will ever admit, especially the first time with a new person. Trying to rush things or do something you're not comfortable with is only going to make you get more in your head. Relax and take your time. Surveys find it's rare for women and men to climax the first time, this period is more often than not about figuring what each other likes.\n\n3) Drunk sex is relatively terrible compared to sober sex. The older you get the more and more you will realize this. Avoid it for that and self-preservation reasons.\n\n4) HPV is fucking everywhere, most sexually active adults have it \n\n5) Everybody else seems like they're having way more sex than they actually are. George Costanza was supposed to be bad with women on Seinfeld and was regularly sleeping with women played by sports illustrated models. Were the first generation to have less sex than their parents. The reality is unless you're utterly committed and effective at being Barney Stinson, you're way more likely to have about a dozen flings and relationships in your life than have a partner count comparable to a sitcom character.\n\n6) Have fun! Find what you want to try, and see what your partner is willing to try and run with it. It's a learning journey that's never really over.",

One, she wont let me actually put it in her, although she does want to, which is because shes afraid of getting pregnant, which I completely understand, and I'm not going to try to change her mind about it. Two, she wont let me do anything oral towards her, which is what my question is about. Shes told me that shes very insecure about it, and I dont know why. I never push her to do anything she doesnt want me to do, and I never will. My question is, how do I get past her insecurity?

They may look super hot when they're ready to go out but when at home they can stink, fart, burp, and look not nearly as good as they do when they have makeup on.  I am only saying this to let dudes know women don't always look super hot.  \n\nIf you start to live with one, things are going to get way more difficult.  You'll see what I've mentioned above.  Again this is not a problem it's just reality.  You're going to find out the truth - women are nuts.  Sorry women, it's true.  You're going to have to figure out a lot of their psych/emotional crap.\n\nIf you don't believe me I'll just repeat a joke I heard from mark Normand.  Women need to FEEL sexy to have sex, if I needed to feel sexy then . . . I would never have sex.  \n\nTry to relax and have fun.  And don't put so much emphasis on sex and or being in a relationship.  Trust me its not all fucking rainbows and unicorns.  Another great line is from bill Burr on relationships - you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.  \n\nBest advice I got is to enjoy making out.  Just get into kissing her and grabbing her all over, ass, thighs, back, and sometimes just grab her behind the neck/head and tongue kiss her.  As many mentioned before 4play is essential.  Don't get lazy on this\n\nIf in a relationship, try not to jack off a lot.  Maybe twice a week at the most.  (I'm working on this now). It really does make your more horny and dick harder.  Also, guys not being able to nut or very difficult to nut is a thing.  It's most likely from too much jacking off; either that or nerves.  \n\nIf you are lucky enough to have a baby with a woman, just know that you are totally fucked (loljk). Because sex will be on the back burner for a while.  And if you thought she was crazy before holy shit you are wrong!  Take care of the mommas and the baby and at about a year shit should get back to normal.  That is if you can be a man and take care of your family.  \n\nI'm not a big fan of asking women what you should do to fuck them.  Sure if she tells you then remember it.  But act confident, explore around and be creative.  Don't worry if you don't have a 20 foot cock cuz hardly anybody else does either.  And surprise surprise, a lot of women can't even take a huge dick.  The bitches in porn are like the NBA of fuckers.  \n\nThanks",

I didn‚Äôt learn how to do it until I got married and kind of stumbled upon the technique myself, but it‚Äôs something I wish I learned earlier. And, to be fair, I‚Äôm no master at it but when I execute it properly it definitely helps me last longer. Basically, edging is when you are about to cum but you purposely slow down or stop altogether rightttt before you fully orgasm. This triggers a sort of ‚Äúreset‚Äù for your orgasm process and lets you last longer. You might release some pre-cum with this method but you shouldn‚Äôt fully orgasm. Be sure to listen to your partner‚Äôs cues because if they are about to cum they will be quite frustrated if you just stop right before they finish, lol. I‚Äôm sure someone could explain edging better than myself but that‚Äôs the basic idea.",

Does she like tongue? Like it rough or soft? Breastplay or no? Penetration? Clitoris? Maybe they like the pussy lips played with the most?\n\nIn foreplay, explorer. Make her have a good time and find out what she likes. Maybe even make her cum a first time. Then you start sex. She might be begging you for sex, but in my experience a lot will appreciate if you tell them no and just explorer more to pleasure them. This is of course not a rule or something. If you see her getting irritated or bored at the foreplay you can indeed start fucking. But don't move to sex when she tells you too per se. Move to sex when she gets bored, or you've given her enough and found out what she really likes.\n\nTry to incorporate what makes her tick into sex if possible.",

Lay the foundation. Flirt a little. \n\nWhen you go to do foreplay, don't start by touching obvious areas, touch her EVERYWHERE. Kiss her head to toe and make her feel like she's irresistible. Do that until she start fidgeting and getting ticklish (in a sexy way not a teehee kinda way) then go for the nipples, lick em, kiss em, whatever you gotta so, and when you get down to her cave of wonders, no matter what method you choose, play with her clit as slowly and softly as humanly possible. \n\nYou'll know when she's ready because at this point she's about ready to burst and will put it in for you, and if she doesn't, slip in just a bit and inch in real slow.

They all love this trick, using the pillowcase to then bind her arm(s) above her head or behind her back, while holding it in one hand, gently using it around her neck, blindfolding, etc. restricting her movements and pinning her down when done right is a turn on for the majority of the time with the majority of women.

            "text": "It is okay to zone out of the passion to focus analytically on your partners pleasure. Paying attention to their verbal and physical cues can help ensure that you aren't giving them second hand attention while servicing yourself using them. Plus, if you can at least temporarily break out of your passion mode, you will discover seemingly small things that will enhance the sensory experience for your partner. Maybe you have been to formulaic and ignored an unconscious request to switch the tempo, or you've accidentally found a preferred angle/pressure/spot that only gets minimal play normally. Just as too much attention in one spot can rub a sensitive spot raw, giving lesser noticed spots attention can increase sensitivity to heightened enjoyment as a result. \n\nWe hear our own heartbeat all day every day, and only \"notice\" it when it suddenly breaks rhythm, like when we are suddenly startled. Doing the exact same things in bed, even if enjoyable can become subconsciously boring and even reviled if an alternative that is/seems new becomes available.\n\nEdit: while reading comments, I recalled something. If it isn't working for you, but they are enjoying it, you don't have to stop. So long as you aren't being used or hurt, you can absolutely continue until they are satisfied. Discuss what was not working for you after the cool down lap is finished. Not during the encounter or the cool down lap. After, when \"the glow\" has pretty much faded. And don't be aggressive in explaining. Carry the joy you felt at their enjoyment into it. This will help color your speech and physical expression so that you don't appear negative. That will help avoid destroying the experience of your partner and help show that you are open to things that don't do anything for you but leave your partner climbing the walls in pleasure. \n\nAdditionally, it's completely, absolutely, unequivocally good to have sex/intimate interactions that DON'T result in orgasm. This shouldn't be the norm, and if it is, or starts to, become the norm then you need to have an open conversation with your partner. Maybe you are too stressed, maybe your body is changing (this doesn't end with puberty for men or women), maybe you have focused on one aspect too much, or maybe you (both or singly) have gotten too busy to really relax in your encounters. You might find that something you previously didn't enjoy is more fun, and can fall back on previous fun at times to avoid complacency.",

You don‚Äôt have to clear it completely, but at least tidy it up and get any hair off and around tour dick and balls. It‚Äôll make your penis look bigger, feel nicer and you‚Äôll get better blow jobs. Use a hair removal cream first; the operation will go more smoothly and you‚Äôll be less likely to accidentally pull out a pube or cut yourself.\n\nWhen fingering - stroke, don‚Äôt jab.\n\nAnd finally‚Ä¶ go to the toilet after you‚Äôre done, even a quick pee will clear out any left over sexy time fluids and keep your insides clean. Cock care is real, gents!",

Some women like a bit of su king action, some like tongue punching a bit, some like rotating the tongue, others like flicking the tongue, fast, slow, etc. Pay attention to her body language, and the way her muscles feel around her hips. If they start to contract, she's kind of squirming a bit, KEEP DOING THAT. The next time, build up to that exact technique that worked, and experiment a little to fine tune it. Once you've mastered oral, a girl will always want more. Then you move on to fingers. Same process. Some girls don't really like fingering at all, some just want the tongue, you need to find out. You can ask these things too, but keep in mind she has had other men that probably didn't know what they were doing and she probably thinks all fingers are violent and pokey, yours don't have to be - so give it a try, but be gentile and slow, again paying attention to the same ques. Btw, don't just finger, finger while you give oral. It's an additive if they want it, to prepare for the main event. When you give her the bigger stuff, she better be soaked. Start with the tip and really make this part last because they'll be dieing with anticipation. Just the tip means just the tip. Again, just the tip, probably for aboht 2 minutes while you're doing other stuff. By this time she's gonna be begging for it. Once you've worked that up enough, I have a move that never fails: (sorry if it's graphic) whisper in her ear something like \"you ready\" real slow and sensual like... Then when she emphatically says yes (she will), slowly slowly enter all the way. This is great because you ask for consent before doing it, but in a sexy way that's always sure to excite. Make her feel every bit of you until you reach the end, then from there just find your rhythm and pay attention to her body language like before. Same concepts.",

Try to set your own pleasure aside and focus on hers only, no rushing or anything, and with time(and patience) you‚Äôll get to know her cues and reactions to what you do right. The worst enemy for most women are our minds - we either start to think that YOU must think it takes too long or you don‚Äôt enjoy doing it etc. etc., so often we compromise on our own pleasure in order to please you(I blame unrealistic porn amongst other things).\n\nAnother culprit is when you think going all squiggly wiggly on our clitoris with your tongue(or fingertips); most often a firm and consistent circular or up/down motion is key, otherwise if you do something really really good only to speed up or do something different with your tongue/finger we lose ‚Äòmomentum‚Äô. \n\nHowever, it IS a two-way street, talking and communicating openly about sex is num√©ro uno!\n\n\nThat said, there are unfortunately a fair bit of women who either fake orgasms or don‚Äôt tell their partners how they want it and that is a massive disservice to women ourselves, because a lot of men seem to believe they‚Äôre the bomb when they‚Äôre, at most, mediocre and don‚Äôt really understand that female pleasure is individual, not universal. If I recall correctly only around 20% of women can get orgasms from vaginal penetration only; so the majority of women needs clitoral stimuli to orgasm - so do yourself a favour and learn how the female body works, it‚Äôs not rocket science - it‚Äôs simply caring about your partner‚Äôs pleasure over your own.",

            "text": "Hygiene and presentation matter!\n\nJock itch can is the result of moisture in and around your groin that has no where to go and can produce redness, dry skin, and irritation. It can be cleared up with Aloe Vera sun gel or straight aloe vera from the plant. Depending on how bad a few applications to the affected area will clear up in a week. If it takes longer than this to see results consult your doctor. After a shower get in there with a towel and make sure the area is thoroughly dry, baby powder can help absorb moisture out of your skin. If you work a physical job or are just a generally sweaty person consider moisture wicking undergarments.  \n\nClean up hair around your member, don't shave the day of action, especially with a new partner. There's a lot of wetness going on during sex and you can get irritated after a fresh shave.  Trim with scissors (or if you're handy with electric clippers) all around including your taint and ball sack making sure all hair is pretty much equal length. Shave the base of the shaft to increase the appearance of length, if your partner is into giving head they will appreciate this. It is normal to have hair on your shaft including a few stragglers that are higher up, tweezing can cause little bumps to form and potentially cause ingrown hairs which is something you DO NOT want. I personally have never tried a hair removal cream but scissors once a week keeps it tame. (If your partner is already on you about beard trimmings/shaving in the sink or shower be courteous and clean up after, face hair is one thing but genital hair will start a whole new argument, I personally do it over the toilet and damp wipe the brim or anywhere else it happens, avoid doing in the shower to not clog the drain). A dedicated pair of scissors for your groin is a smart thing to do, you can purchase mens grooming kits that have small scissors. \n\nWhen going down on your partner (can only speak of when doing this on a female but I assume it's the same for male on male) you will produce A LOT of saliva. If you've ever received a quality BJ before you're going to notice your whole region is now wet with spit and it's normal. If you try to swallow all the spit while going down you're going to make yourself nauseous, spit it out but don't make the \"pewtew\" sound when doing so, that only happens in porn and its not sexy. \n\nLike a lot of men here are saying it takes time and tactic for a female partner to reach climax during intercourse and while you're focused on pleasing your partner don't worry if it's not great for you. Please your partner and then take time for yourself, do what feels good for them then do what feels good for you, but make sure you switch it up sometimes for who goes first. \n\nFucking is it's own category of intimacy and should be treated differently than sex and/or \"making love\" (which is saved for the most intimate of experiences between two people that ACTUALLY care about each other, and it does happen when you actually care about the other person and it can be very special).  But treat fucking like a workout, you should be sweaty and tired afterwards, your hips should not be able to support you when you're done and your legs like jelly. Pound that pussy like it's the last thing you'll ever do on this earth, dont try and hurt her but there should be an audible slap as you thrust into her.\n\nWhen she's on top and the position is a little weird careful how much you get into moving your hips with her because if she's very wet and you slip out there's is a HIGH potential that your erect member is going to get bent in half. That will kill the mood, you might get some sympathy attention after if you're lucky and not in too much pain but the last time it happened to me I was too tender for a whole day after. \n\nIn my experience, women never talk about it but some of them love cum. When you're getting close to the moment ask them where they want it. If your partner is into you they will want you very badly to climax and when you start to moan when getting close their anticipation goes up, I will ask my partner \"Do you want it in your pussy?\" which is generally immediately answered with an intense yes and you can see the pleasure on their face as you climax inside, but if she's got other ideas in her head then she will say so. Recently asked my partner and she told me on her face where after I finished and practically collapsed beside her she grabbed her vibrator and went for round 2 by herself, no complaints on my end. \n\nWhich reminds me, don't be silent like ninja. Women are different than men and all of their senses are active when trying to climax. Make noises, tell them how fucking sexy they are or how good things feel. They will appreciate the feed back and get more into it. If you are already a ninja and have trouble making noises during sex start with just letting the moans out when you're climaxing and you'll get more comfortable making noise during intercourse. No matter what you do, do not emulate what you see/hear in porn. Be natural, don't force it.\n\nLastly, really guys don't masturbate when you're in a relationship. Death grip, getting to used to your own hand or needing to think of a actress or scene you too frequently spend your boys on is detrimental to your sexual health. It may not seem like a big issue to the younger guys but when you start rounding 40 you're going to want to take care of your sexual health. There are of course foods and supplements you can take (I take Macca pills once a day and eat mango once a week) but when it comes down to it if you haven't partaken in a few weeks or a month then you get with a partner your experience will be so much more intense you'll never want to skin your own again.",

Rather, just wanting to share something that I‚Äôve found massive success with. \n\nKeep in mind that your turn will come (no pun intended) and you will achieve orgasm. PLUS‚Ä¶it‚Äôs always better the longer you wait while building excitement and anticipation. \n\nFor me specifically, this looks like always having her experience and her pleasure be absolute top priority. Foreplay and oral are key!  At this point, I almost never approach penetration without getting my wife off via cunnilingus AT LEAST two times first. Sometimes though, I use oral to bring her right to the edge of orgasm and then stop and repeat this a few times before giving her an orgasm. \n\nWith either approach tho, the goal is to please her, focus on something (in this case oral) that makes HER the center of focus for an extended period of time. With my wife, it tends to drive her wild and makes everything even more amazing when it comes to my turn. Plus, now she talks about this with her sisters and girlfriends and, allegedly, they are all insanely jealous as they ‚Äúhave never gotten off so many times or so intensely.‚Äù\n\nSelfishly for me, it has made it so that giving oral is the aspect of sex I most look forward to each time. I let my hands wander her body while my tongue goes to work and it is intoxicating to feel her energy and pleasure ripple through her as she gets to cum over and over again all while still anticipating our enviable crescendo via intercourse. Lastly, I have found that this technique goes A LONG way in syncing our orgasms. So at this point, penetration leads to simultaneous orgasms a good 90% of the time. \n\nTL:DR - focus on nothing but pleasing her throughout and you won‚Äôt regret it.",

This is something that communication and being open to try different things will help you both get over. \n\nEspecially for women who are not super sensitive internally(ie. have a difficult time cumming from just vaginal stimulation) which is a lot more women that you might think. This would be a great time to bust out the toys and play with her, let her use her favorite massager and watch. Finger her while she does it. Then maybe move on to intercourse while she‚Äôs still using it . \n\nThis will not only result in an actually orgasm during sex, but your partner will slowly shed those old habits of faking an orgasm just to make you feel good. \n\nI‚Äôve talked to many of my female friends privately and almost all of us have gone through multiple relationships without EVER having an orgasm during sex. It‚Äôs sad really. So if you really CARE about your partners pleasure, have her show you what she does, mix things up from what YOU typically like to do to something she may be into, try to foster good and open communication between the two of you; it‚Äôll take time and patience and a willingness to try new things.\n\nAnd also moan a little, that shits hot as fuck. \nGood luck! üëçüèº",

The idea is actually to spend a lot of time doing that so when you do finally work your way down the clit is extended and easier to find (for you beginners it means she‚Äôs stimulated and turned on). In my experience it‚Äôs harder to find on thicker or fatter women, but the more extended it is the easier it is to locate on any girl plus she‚Äôs wet as fuck so it‚Äôs always important to spend more time up time or sucking on titties or all of the above then you realize so she‚Äôs extra stimulated. By the time you do finally get to the clit suck on it don‚Äôt bite it or ‚Äúflick the bean‚Äù like I often hear. It would be like a girl biting your nut sack. So just suck it with your lips, then finger her quickly and forcefully everywhere in a circular motion or however. The while doing both of these you will choke her neck. Squeeze around the sides (not hard with your only hand) to cut off blood flow to the head and not air flow dead center. This is my signature move I call it ‚ÄúThe Barclay‚Äù (My last name). I tell girls or use it on them and they never have dudes do this. It‚Äôs really fucking easy too and, self made and master level shit. You‚Äôll find if you get the opportunity to use this like I have been for years eventually most girls will tell you to stick it in after a period of time. Ignore her and keep using my triple threat move for a while longer. By the time you do stick it in she will more than likely goop all over your pubes and probably orgasm before you. People always ask how to make her orgasm first. This is my answer from having over 40 women in my bed as a REAL number not one of these made up exaggerated ones.

Make a gesture like you‚Äôre telling someone to come closer (use either one or two fingers, depends on your partner). Find the slightly rough spot on the interior front wall of the vagina, and drag your fingertips down it using the motion described above. Make sure your nails are short and smooth. You can then use your thumb to stimulate the clitoris (if you have rough, callused hands it‚Äôs often better to let your partner dictate the intensity of this stimulation by letting her move her hips). \n\nSome other basic ones:\n\n1. Thrust with your buttocks, not your whole body. This will create more friction between your bodies, which is good for clitoral stimulation. It also makes it much easier to kiss during the act since your head isn‚Äôt moving around all the time. If you find you can‚Äôt thrust with just your buttocks, you need to go to the gym. \n\n2. When she‚Äôs on top of you, flex your buttocks to raise your hips slightly. This will make it easier for her to grind her clit against your body. \n\n3. Don‚Äôt be silent. Lots of guys are guilty of this. Don‚Äôt make fake porn noises, but let your partner know how much you‚Äôre enjoying her. How would you feel if the girl was totally silent? Probably not very good. Don‚Äôt be silent.\n\n4. Everyone should be familiar with neck kissing/biting, but lots of people ignore the ears. The ears are an erogenous zone for many people. Try gently kissing and sucking them; there‚Äôs a good chance the response will be positive. Stop if it isn‚Äôt positive.\n\n6. Communicate.

If you're in a relationship it's mighty important to seduce in the simplest ways. Like, doing the goddamn dishes or any chore she generally doesn't like. Pick up the slack and do shit. Don't sit around playing your games or being lazy. Get up and do something lol. Then, you have to say things that compliment her as often and as genuinely as possible; sweet things, nasty things and just normal compliments like telling her she did a good job with something she put work into. Lastly, don't take your hands away, touch her bum, graze her thighs, kiss that neck every so often. It's mighty important that if you're trying to turn her on, you best put in some work well ahead of schedule. But a lot of women don't like to plan sex, so you can seduce her over period of time never sliding to the fact that you plan on doing it. It should be apparently clear but with a bit of mystery. Take her when she least expects it but clearly is desiring it. You can feel her emotions if you've been flirting, you'll know. \n\nSecondly, take a blow job as a gift not an expectation. When y'all ready to get down she might not want to put your dick in her mouth, maybe she just wants to get right to it. So do it. If you do your job right though and blow her mind, she'll be likely to suck your dick more often I can almost guarantee that ( doesn't apply to ever woman though). \n\nLastly, once your in, there are some important details; rhythm, vibration, pressure, teasing, edge and release tactics. touching in sensitive spots, repeat what works but not too often, just often enough. Some women like it rough some do not, you have to find out how she likes it without asking. Feeling her out is key. She will give you cues.",

Don't copy porn where the sex is open and just about thrusting. In porn they need to fit a camera in-between the couple which just isn't good sex. Having closed sex where you're body is rubbing tightly against hers also simulate her clitoris if you get it right. Don't worry about your weight on her. Rock your body against hers up and down instead of thrusting in and out, minimal effort is required this way. Trust me, if you get the position right, close sex is magical for both of you. \n\n3. Drink plenty of water prior. Half a litre to a litre at least. You WILL perform better and last longer if you are properly hydrated. \n\n4. Caress, stroke, kiss and simply engage her body. You will last longer because all your attention isn't on thrusting etc. \n\n5. Experiment with different condoms even magnums, and actually use a condom. I hate condoms but I've found 2 that I like and can use without hurting the sexual experience.  \n\n6. Give instructions. One of the hottest thing is when in doggy and the girl is thrusting herself into you. But she won't know to do that unless you tell her. Many guys complain about having sex with they're partner because their partner just lays their like a dead fish. Ok but did you give her any instructions or did you just allow that. \n\n7. Have fun. Sounds weird to say this but truthfully all the other rules can go out the window as long as you were having fun. It can feel daughting and like there's a list of thing you need to get right as a guy but ultimately none of that matters if you're not having fun. One of my mistakes I made with this girl who was an 11 was when we were having sex I was more shocked that I bagged this girl etc that I totally forgot to have fun. Truly one of my most stressful sexual experiences when it could have been my best and most fun. We aren't together today, i think it is mainly because i didn't add fun into the relationship or the sex.",

Many of my first sexual incounters were pretty straight forward and to the point. You put it in, you pull it out, and after a few minutes you're done. As years start to go by, and everyone continues to mature I noticed that my relationships were very short, even though they were filled with sex. During the end of my junior year of high school I had gotten back in touch with a childhood friend after helping my sibling move to FL. She was around during my elementary and part of my middle school years and we always hung out even though as a young boy I wasn't into girls because of the usual \"cooties\" trope. Anyways, while meeting for the first time in years in Florida we hit it off, and she mentioned how she used to have a crush on me since we were kids, I never felt the same way as she was not the best looking and I wasn't into girls at the time, but overtime she grew into a beautiful young woman, and we were in the hotel room drinking beers so at that moment I was DEFINITELY feeling the same way she was. So we start going at it, and thats when she starts directing me to what she likes, and thats the first time I had ever made a girl orgasm and multiple times on top of that. I left Florida and her behind and we haven't talked since, because she had a boyfriend and eventually they ended up having a baby. \n\nSo the lesson for the boys and even the girls out there who may come across this, just like for your whole relationship, communication is the key to a good sex life.",

Now, the clit isnt only the little bean under the hood, the clit extends out under the outer lips, bite on them lick them make her wet without even fingering her or even getting close to her clit. Try kissing a weak spot on their neck, belly, inner thigh, anything that you can feel that it turns them on. \n\nNow here's where the real fun begins so try out a couple of combos, as in technique 1 with no g spot or ps spot stimulation, later with g spot stimulation 1 finger, 2 finger so on and so on sooner or later one of the combos will hit her sweet spot (maybe its all five fingers in her and sucking on her clit or its only long and slow lick on her clit without any fingers in her at all it all depends on the woman) but if you still have things to try out move on to the next, this will tease her or she'll like what comes next even more. If there isnt a better reaction go back to the one that gave the most moans and start doing that till she cums maintaining the rhythm believe me if you go faster or slower she's gonna loose it. \n\nBonus tips: compliment on her flavor even if your not a fan of eating pussy and you do it to please her, complimenting her on the taste of her pussy makes fer feel estra hpt and that makes Cumming for her even easier. Also If you moan on her pussy she'll love the vibration of your voice on her clit\n\nHope this helps you improve or if its the first time eating a pussy.

Persistence with trying to 'land' one woman ___does not work, ___ AND it looks like you're desperate, but _not_ being 'persistent' when she rebuffs you, (but _be polite)_ will have all the, _other_ women, around her, thinking: \"She's an idiot, I'm not; I know a good man when I see him.\"\n\n_Be ready to commit._\n\nWomen do not want wishy-washy men, once it's serious, you bring your B-game, NOT your C-Game, and occasionally even A-Game hard and fast to keep her satisfied, both with you on the day-to-day AND in the bedroom, and make sure that you keep polishing up on that B-game So that eventually the B-Game looks like your old A-Game and the new A-Game is so customized to her specifically that she literally can not imagine anyone else even being worth her time. \n\nFor genuine sex tricks; some pointers.\n\nA man who has just the faintest traces of pussy on his breath is like an aphrodisiac to a lot of women: make sure that your girlfriend is down to poly before you try to use it, but do not be afraid to eat her out right before heading to the bar or other venue with her: though do a quick brush and rinse before you go.\n\nA lot of women are secretly yearning to be more adventurous than they want to admit publicly that they are, if you can get her beyond that uncomfortable space into a \"learning zone\" she will adore you.\n\nBDSM and kinky stuff is more than a toy to try, it is a lifestyle, or at least a lot of people think that: see if it is that for you as well, or just a way to be extra spicy. (Heck, you may even be one of those people who are not into the spicy stuff in bed, no shame.)\n\nMost women DO NOT like anal; they are not even capable of doing so. You have to have special 'extra' pleasure nerves wrapped around your anus to enjoy it as a woman, which most people don't.
