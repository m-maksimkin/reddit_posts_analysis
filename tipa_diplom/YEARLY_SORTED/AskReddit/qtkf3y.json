Gram wasnt hurt, and his friend and him both left...I called my mom and told her what happened. Then we informed security.\n\nFast forward to 2am. Phone rings and its security (gated community) saying the asshole was at the gate and wanted his stuff. Im listening on the other phone while gram talks to them and explains he cannot come here without the real police and security. In this time, I snuck into my moms room and stole her revolver, loaded it, and climbed out my window onto the roof...and waited. He lost security some how and next thing i hear is his buddies car ripping up the block. As soon As he got out he was ranting, high as the sky, and so I took a shot. I kept taking shots, until security and the cops showed up. He was trying to tell them to arrest the 16yr old on crutches while he was trespassing.

I used to work at a ski hill in Canada, and because of the low pay, and the fact I went to college and really needed money, so I worked so many hours, My work suffered extremely badly, ending up with my co workers even losing great deals of money because of it.  Now added on to this, I ended up having serious romantic feelings for this one of my fellow employees.  needless to say, possibly because of the money issues, and to a lesser extent, because of the romantic bit, they hated me with extreme prejudice.  One day, I decided to go back to said ski hill, thinking there was no real reason for them to hate me so bad.  I was on the hill, riding the chair, and I did not notice that I was riding up the chair with one of them.  I think I said hi to them or something of that nature, then I got off the chair, and we went out separate ways, or so I thought.  When I got to the crest of the run I wanted, I started down on the side of the run, where I usually preferred, as there is far more unspoiled snow.  Then, out of nowhere, this same person, appeared within close proximity to me, I surmise she was trying to make me fall down the side of the hill at speed, which I usually ski at or above 50 kph approximately.  Now down the side of that run, is a steep embankment, with many trees on it.  If I had went down that embankment, any one of those, with my speed, would have killed me.  I don’t know if that is what this person meant or not, but the outcome is undeniable.  Now I can tell you, I did not do anything worthy of being hated so much,",

            "text": "Idk if this even counts, but oh well. This happened when my kids were young and I was still with their father. We had a horrible relationship at that point. I hadn't been able to do much around the house and had been very ill for a few years because I had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and was going through a long relapse. Luckily the kids were at my moms for a few days. There were no clean dishes left in the house, and he was refusing to clean any so that we could eat. He said it was my turn and he was waiting for me to feel better to do them (I was on bed rest at the time). We had a heated argument, and he locked himself in the bathroom. I finally decided, screw my bed rest order, I would just have to do some dishes, the whole thing was so ridiculous in the first place. The dish soap and sponge were in the bathroom because we had started using the bathroom sink to do dishes once the kitchen sink was full. Yes I know that's pretty sad but that was the situation. I tried to get him to open the bathroom door so that he could hand me the dish soap and the sponge and he wouldn't. I got pretty angry as you can probably imagine, and I know I shouldn't have but I started hip thrusting the bathroom door instead of knocking on it. Right when I went to do a hip thrust, he ripped the bathroom door open even though it was locked and I stumbled into the bathroom because of my momentum. He then grabbed me around my neck from behind in a Chokehold and picked me up off of my feet and was holding me there. He was forcing me to look at myself in the mirror oh, I don't remember exactly what he was saying but I started to pass out and I knew my life was in danger. At the last second, I grabbed a small pan that was in the bathroom sink and tried to hit him with it but I wasn't able to get my arms up high enough. That was the last thing I remember until I woke up a few minutes later. I came out the bathroom and I could hear him locked in our bedroom and it sounded like he was stabbing our furniture with a knife and making suicide threats. I was still pretty Dazed and Confused but I called 911. They said that somebody had already called and they were on their way. When they got there they took him into custody as he was still acting irate, I told them what had happened and they had paramedics look at my neck. I said I didn't want to press charges and that I had also been in the wrong, but they said I didn't have a choice because I could have died from what he had done. I had a cut on my chin from when I passed out and he apparently dropped me but it didn't need stitches, and the only real damage to my neck was some bruising and I lost my voice for a few days. He went to jail and I stupidly helped his mother bail him out. We had a no contact order for a week before court. During that week, I had a medical emergency and surgery (I was told most likely from all the stress) and almost lost my thumb. So when we went to court, I convinced the district attorney that it had been just as much my fault as his, and that I really needed him around to help me with the children, so they let him off with anger management classes and dropped the charges. Only years later reflecting on the incident did I realize that while my behavior wasn't all that appropriate for the situation, his obviously wasn't either and I needed to stop blaming myself for what had happened. Ironically we have shared custody of my kids now and he loves to make my life hell at every chance he gets. I should have let him get charged (it was supposed to be domestic battery with attempt to kill, a two year minimum sentence) and left him in jail. That was many years ago though. I have been with wonderful man for almost eight years now and we are happy and so are my kids.",

We were supposed to meet up with the rest of the crew later so we head back to my house. Upon leaving the playground some dude gives my homie and I the meanest look like he wanted to fight but he didn't do anything. We get to my house and I notice the lights were on which meant my parents were still up and we reeked of weed smoke so we decided to just putz around the block til my friends showed up. Bad decision. As soon as I closed the front gate I heard someone scream \"THERE THEY GO RIGHT THERE!!!!\" and then began to open fire. My friend and I are running down the street at top speed in a semi crouch while the guy is letting off round after round. We turn down an alley and begin to head to my back yard to hide but before we could get there the gunman cuts us off at the other end of the alley! At this point we do a quick 180 and head to the nearest main street and try to get as much distance between us and the mysterious thug as possible. At this point my homie and I and the gunman were winded and we're all doing this out of breath power walk. I notice that the gunman meets up with another local thug that I recognize who is also known to carry a 44 caliber handgun and after they exchange a few words he joins the chase! By this point my friend and I have nearly regained our breath and we plan on making another sprint for our lives when by the grace of all the higher powers you can name we see an unmarked police car with its flashing lighs that was in the middle of pulling a car over in a completely unrelated incident. The cop car scares off our would be assailants and gives my friend and I the chance to live and tell this story.\n\nTL DR: My best friend and I were nearly killed by two gun toting thugs after smoking weed on a school playground",

He closed the gap and reached for my rifle at which point I unloaded 4 shots into him. I checked on him and was getting ready to provide medical assistance since he was no longer a threat but the crowd got really mad and started yelling things like \"get him\" so I took off running towards the police to turn myself in and to obtain safety from the violent mob. \n\nBefore I could make it to the police another convicted felon caught me and took his skateboard into his hands like a baseball bat and clubbed me in the head with it. I fell to the ground and before he could strike me again I shot him once. The bullet entered just below his left nipple and traveled through his thorax coming to rest at his right collar bone. He died on the scene.\n\nYet another convicted felon then caught up to me while I was on the ground and had a pistol in his hands. When I saw him and leveled my rifle at him to get him to back off. At first he raised his hands in fake surrender but then aimed his pistol at me so I fired a shot that blew his right bicep off.\n\nI then made it to the police and they told me to go home so I turned myself in to the police there.

My heart didn't get out of my throat until I got back to the shop.

I got this second hand and some bits were excluded because she didn't feel like incriminating herself and I was 13 at the time. This was back in like 2002ish and she was driving around town with a few friends. She was into a pretty bad crowd at the time and she and her friend Shannon ended up at a party. Shannon got into a fight over money and she and my sister and the third guy whose name escapes me bailed out when a \"skeevy bitch\" pulled a gun out. They piled into the car and my sister peeled out. The skeevy bitch followed and shot at the car as she was driving off. Car got hit 3 times, one of them went through Shannon's neck, the other two didn't hit anyone. Shannon started bleeding everywhere, my sister understandably lost her shit. She got a few miles away then got into a car accident running a stop sign. Ems arrived, Shannon survived by some ridiculous miracle and the \"skeevy bitch\" got arrested. I honestly don't know how that all resolved because that mess caused my sister to relapse and I suddenly had my own shit to deal with again.",

Had to repair that. Continued to beat my head into the floor any pull my legs behind my head. Holy balls I’ve never hurt so bad feeling those ligaments tear. I couldn’t walk for weeks. They gave me a separate room for for the duration of the honeymoon. Still not sure why he did this. He was admittedly drunk. NOT an excuse. Threw my phone in a pond so I was rendered helpless in another country. I gave him an ultimatum. He went to a domestic abuse counselor and court ordered domestic violence classes. Hasn’t touched me since (3 years) but admits he has anger issues. He is starting counseling again tomorrow. Thank you for asking this question, OP. Please people. Get help. Stand up for yourself.

In this private middle school mostly full of toxic and cliquey preteens, there was this one lanky kid who acted like the thug of the grade. Always a fun time, right? He picked on me all year, and he had a bunch of lackeys and people who just went along with him out of fear (including a couple who I thought were *my* friends. Great). One day, he decided to get everyone to throw freshly sharpened pencils at me. Each of these ~7-8 guys had about 10 pencils, it wasn't fun dodging/running from them. But the moment my life flashed before my eyes was when this kid decided to pull a little pocket knife with what in the moment looked like a 6-8 inch blade (was probably actually closer to 5? idk) out of his pocket and throw it at me. I didn't even realize until it had already landed past me after spinning past at chest height. When I realized it was a knife, I kind of freaked out even more, but there wasn't really much I felt I could do about it—snitches get bullied more in toxic middle schools and I realized that \"bullied more\" was quite literally unsafe at that point. I never talked about it until know except once, and I ended up seeing the kid again at a library (I didn't know he could read) once in high school, I almost physically ran away. Turns out he's now a 2nd amendment aficionado and Trump supporter, can't say I'm shocked.\n\nNot even sure if you count this as a murder attempt as much as just a sadist having his fun, and definitely not as horrid as some other stories on this thread, but it was def scarring for my 11 year old self.",

My friend in college had a really abusive boyfriend. None of us in her social circle liked him. On top of mentally and verbally abusing her, he would often try to be aggressive towards friends that would speak out against him, threatening to hurt them or beat them up. We all tried to get her to walk away, but no one had any luck.\n\nFast forward a semester or two, and she's living in the apartment below mine. The same day that my roommate had complained to me he didn't like her coming over unannounced, she did so to borrow some items. Given what my roommate had asked and that I was on a date when she walked in, I told her to comeback later and call first. She took it as me telling her off, and told her boyfriend who took it as an opportunity to threaten me. \n\nHis first messages I ignored because I was on a date, but as my phone continued to blow up I became annoyed. He wanted to know where I lived, presumably to try and fight me given the context of the messages. Annoyed that he would not leave me alone, and already disliking him for who he was, I gave in and told him to come up. I told my date to wait inside my bathroom cause I didn't want her hurt in a scuffle and so she could call the police if necessary.\n\nWhen he arrived, he wasn't alone. He had brought his cousin to jump me. When I opened the door, he swung on me, hitting me in my jaw. However, and not that I'm trained by any means, but I really REALLY did not like this guy, and my State has castle law, so I was within my rights not to retreat. I ended up stunning him with a jab and getting him into a rear naked choke. His cousin kept hitting me and trying to get me off of him, but I held on until he went limp. Him going unconscious freaked out his cousin, who then stopped hitting me to attend to him. In those few moments before he came to, I really thought I had killed somebody. I remember being dumbfounded at what had just happened, and nudging him a little with my foot. He ended up regaining consciousness, gasping and holding his throat like I had crushed it. His cousin helped him up and I went back into a defensive stance and told them to get out before I called the police. To my relief, they were terrified of being arrested for assault and I think shocked that I fought back. His cousin even apologized, and helped the boyfriend out of my apartments threshhold and back down the stairs.\n\nI still think about that moment often. It's the closest I've ever come to killing someone or being killed by someone else. I mean, I've technically had closer calls in car accidents, but I've never been jumped like that before and I'm just glad the situation ended with no one seriously hurt. Even though I couldn't retreat being in my own apartment, they had antagonized me into taking their bait and I still don't know what the legal ramifications might have been had I choked him to death.",

I had no idea if the road was heading to some kind of Main road where there is traffic. So, it was like 5am in the morning and there was a pretty thick forest arond my pathwalk where suddenly another road came along where there was a big house and 2  big black dogs laying down (dont know their breeds) watchin me walk the road ~250m away. I walked, they noticed, i noticed. Cannot remember if i freezed for second but i can clearly remember how both of those hungry dogs came running towards me. My only thought wss to run then also.. I followed the road for maybe 20-30m and then spicked into the forrest jumping over fallen trees and smaal ponds where eventually my sneaker stucked into the mud of bond and i laied down and started to observe barking. Barking came from the road i used to walk and they werent too much away, so my instinct was to crab the wet shoe from the mud and start crawling throughout the forest near the walkpath. So crawled a bit away from those dogs and decided it might be safe enough now. And right after i stood up on walk path, those 2 bastards still saw me and started to run at me, again. So i dis the same thing, ran right into the forest, laied town and started to craw through muddy forest once again, but this time i crawled a lot futher. This time, i had crawled so long that those dogs stayed too far behind me and they didnt see me no more. After the 1st run to the forest i also tried to reach emergency service with no battery phone. They managed to pick up the phone and dingdong.. phone dead. I managed to reach highway, this time when walking the road until highway i grabbed one wooden club, just in case another dog will attack me. Thats my story.

            "text": "I can only tell you what I told but first I'll tell you what I remember.  Please excuse grammar and spelling.... you'll understand why it sucks after you read this. \n\nI had a fight with my ex. I  went out bar hopping. Grabbed an Uber home, but the driver did not want to enter my apartment complex. I've lived there on and off for over 15 - 20 years at that point so I was like \"Whatever, I'll walk in.\" I don't remember anyone outside of their apartment, but we knew basically everyone that lived there. There had been an uptick in crime, but I've already seen two shootings near my building over the years, so I was desensitized to it. I also figured if I kept myself out of their business, they wouldn't bother me. It's worked so far. Why wouldn't it work now? \n\nI woke up in the grass two apartment buildings away from where my mother and I lived. I felt suuuuppperrrrr hungover. I thought I had been roofied. I couldn't really walk, or make coherent thoughts. I don't know how or when I made it into our apartment except I crawled most of the way. \n\nMy mother says I couldn't speak right but that I was insistent that I did  to not want to be taken to the hospital. All I remember I'd trying to tell her I fell and that I was roofied.  I guess I thought the brushing, cuts and all that was from crawling??? I have no idea exactly what I was thinking. My thoughts were like dreams and everything was jumbled up. \n\nShe ended up calling my ex after two or three days when my speech got worse and I got more confused. His step dad was a doctor. His dad said get me to the hospital immediately.  \n\nI remember my ex trying to get a wheelchair because I couldn't walk. I remember being exhausted in the waiting room and falling asleep. \n\nI woke up an unknown time later and tried to break out of the hospital because I had zero idea what was going on. Security stopped me and wheeled me back to the room because,  yeah, I still couldn't walk and had stolen a wheelchair from my room to leave.\n\nSleep. Wake up again being Ragdolled into a shower by the sweetest  nurse. I remember knowing I was modest, but not caring. I knew something bad happened but I couldn't care. \n\n\nSleep again, woke up in a different hospital.  I later learned I had been in the surgical ICU for two weeks. With two major bleeds in my brain plus major swelling. It was touch and go for a bit due to the time it took me to get to the hospital.  Then I was in a step down room during the time I tried to break out, and when the nurse bathed me. Now, I'm in the physical rehab facility.  \n\nSo what happened? I can only guess that the Uber driver picked up on something I didn't. I was beaten as a gang initiation and left for dead. I only learned this because my cousin knew the people somehow. She heard them talking about nearly killing a small pink haired girl and they were surprised I was alive at all. \n\nI suffered major brain damage. I had to learn how to walk, talk, eat, reason, control my emotions etal... basically everything to teach a child. There was no way I could take care of myself without help. \n\nIt was a mindfuck. I knew who I used to be and knew deep down I would never be that person again. \n\nTook me a month to walk with a walker, then I was booted because I didn't have insurance.  Fought to get disability for years. Tried to kill myself after a bit because I never got it. \n\nI'm still crawling out of that hole to this day. I used drugs and booze to hide the fact I was suffering massive PTSD. I still hate using that phrase because I only got beat up, I didn't see war. But.... that's what it is. I quit drugs, then booze a few years later. Got covid which put me in that life or death feeling again and it's exasperated everything mental all over again. I'm back at square one with my anxiety, and it's crippling. \n\nI really wish that Uber driver dropped me off at my apartment. I wish I didn't get slightly drunk. I wish I wasn't complacent about the illegal activity that happened around my house. \n\n\nBut, if all this didn't happen I wouldn't have ever met my fiance. I'd go through it all again in a heartbeat  to meet him again because he's been my biggest cheer leader. He's helped me heal in more ways that physical. He pushes me to do better every day. If it wasn't for him, I highly doubt I'd be around right now.",

I didn't really have any friends, at all. I've had many bullies during my elementary school years, but this one kid was the closest to someone killing me.\n\nThis guy, who I will address as \"FR\" was a tall kid for his age and kind of big. He, as I later found out, had anger issues. I was drinking from a water fountain during recess and a proctor was nearby looking the other way towards the playground. This water fountain had two nozzles to drink from, one on the left and the right. FR starts making his way towards the water fountain and snatches a jump rope from a group of girls that were playing about 3 meters behind me. Once he got ahold of the jump rope, he came at me from behind and wrapped the rope around my neck and started choking me with it yelling that I was on his side of the fountain. I struggled to breath and I felt I was getting rope burn. I managed to grab hold of his shirt somehow and started swinging wildly hoping to land a few punches so he'd let me go, even though I was skinny and weak. He was slamming my head into the fountain and tossing me around while choking me with the rope since he was MUCH bigger and stronger than me.\n\nThe commotion alerted the proctor, who became a friend of my mom's after this, and she blew on her whistle as loud as she could and yelled at FR to stop. She tried to loosen the rope and pull us apart, but it took him seeing I was about to collapse to let go and a good last ditch blow to his balls from my fist to make him let me go and breathe. She took us both to the principal's office and had explained the situation to him. FR got suspended for 2 weeks and I got suspended for two days as well for fighting with another student once again. The Vice Principal had us in her office so we could talk about why he felt the need to do what he did and why he and I were constantly fighting. I told her I didn't know as I never wronged him and hardly talked to him, he just decided to pick on me. He argued I was annoying and that my face irritated him.\n\nHis mom came in and she had him apologize to me and explained to the VP that he was a good kid and didn't think he'd be capable of this, that he just had anger issues and that she's sorry he choked me to near death. He apologized while crying and I honestly forgave him, but I still was resentful about it.\n\nWe became good friends at the end, though. So, I guess something good came out of that.",

She would drag me down socially not afraid to go to any extent just to make me miserable. One day on a field trip to a lake she would splash me. It drove me nuts. I splashed her back and tried to get away. Thats when she grabbed onto me, using her weight and strength to push and hold me underwater. She eventually I guess just got bored after I was thrashing around in the water and just let go and walked away to talk to someone else. Because this trip was hours away, I had to wait until the next day to report it to the principal. I didn’t tell any teachers cause I reported her earlier for spraying me in the eyes with sunscreen (knowing that I’m allergic to it), and I got “just stay away from her then” so I waited until the next day and the male principal started YELLING at ME asking “Why are you always in the center of drama?”",

I convinced them that if anyone saw someone other than myself behind the wheel of my car going towards my house or if my father saw them driving and myself in the back seat, he wouldn't hesitate to start squeezing rounds off before anyone had a chance to say anything. So these idiots let me have my keys believing full well that I'm going to drive them straight to my own robbery and eventual demise.\n\nI decided to have a bit of liquid courage from the endeavor and pulled in to buy 2 tall boys while debating on whether to call the police..what's the fun in that? I wanted to see them squirm like I did being completely out of my element in a crackhouse surrounded by people that want to kill me for money and pocket change at that.\n\nI buy the tall boys, get back in the driver's seat without saying anything or answering questions they had through the entire first 32 ounce can I pounded in order to creep them out as much as I could and it worked very well. With each pull I took from that beer we got another quarter mile away from their home, their comfort zone and hunting ground for victims like myself when first meeting them. I crushed the empty can and threw it in the back seat over my shoulder while displaying sheer apathy if it hit anyone. Not a word was spoken still while they all 3 exchanged nervous glances with one another in confusion, but I ignored them because on the inside I was Christmas morning excited by talking them into this rouge and didn't want my smile to give it away. In their eyes  It's turned from an easy extortion/ free car payday into being trapped inside some half drunk psychos car that they suddenly felt uncomfortable with and now feel victimized being taken against their will into an environment they're not familiar with and have no family around. Sounds familiar right? This is exactly where I wanted them to be.\n\nSo, around 40 minutes of driving later without so much as a roadsign, the car radio or a word spoken F was the first to break. \"You know I gotta be back by 3 to pickup my kids from the bus stop\" she whimpered.\n\n\"Uh huh..\" I murmured halfway through the second tall boy and the awkward silence. \n\nThe tension in the car was at it's peak and I could almost taste it pouring out of them.. and thats when I decided to let them in on what's going to happen. \n\n\"Man..feels good to get out of that crazy hood and drive a bit doesn't it?\" I asked not caring who or if anyone answered. Silence through the car along the sound of the highways asphalt creased subtle thuds.\n\n \"I've had this car for about 8 years now and wouldn't know what I'd do without it\" I say as I'm petting the dashboard like a dog. \"It would be just awful if someone stole it or maybe even forced me to sell it you know?\" ....thud..thud..the road cont. in utter silence.\n\nJ has a tone in his voice I hadn't heard yet while knowing him \"you you know...you don't want me to get on this phone I have and call my peoples right?\" He said in a half serious but half asking my permission to relax kind of inflection with a flexed eyebrow awaiting my response.\n\n Me- \"and tell them what, that you were planning on killing or extorting me and getting paid for it?\" I giggled. His mouth tightened up like a pursed lip forcing itself to be tough but I could see one of his eyes start to well up with tears. \"..tell them where you are\" I said knowing that he had no clue. J looks around but there's nothing but fields of grey because I'm on a backroad heading towards my house and he's never been there.\n\nMe: \"..you know you guys have been up for awhile now..6 days I think..\" \nMe: \"Do you know what day it is?\" \nJ-\"No..\"\nMe: \"Do you know my last name?\"\nJ/T - both shaking their heads no\nMe: \"okay..okedoke..\"\n\nMe: \"Do you think you'd have enough pep in ya to hold off my 2 cousins, my dad and uncle that are waiting for us to pull in my driveway right now and myself of course, you think you might hold us off from beating you to death and burying you deep where a plow rolls over and packs the soil at the lot right next to my house twice a year?\"",

If you've ever seen gore videos it's like that surprised but sad/shocked empty look the millisecond someone dies and is extremely rare and unfortunate to witness as it doesn't fade from memory that easy.\n\n...The 3 of them sat with that glare being too bewildered to stammer out an answer..\n\nMe: \"Then, so they won't know who has an ear of corn growing out there a** if and when they find you, we'll have already burned your hands and heads in the woodburner in the garage while I chuckle hearing your teeth pop like kettle corn as they heat up..\"\n\n*pop pu-pop pop* as they flinched everytime I made that sound (that's my favorite part)\n\n\" T - \"man you don't want our peoples up here man we just wanna go!

With J on probation who shouldn't be out of town right now, T is paroled but one more mark and he goes for at least 10 years and F has a meth pipe and God only knows what else in her purse along with shakey custody of her kids right now. You either all three toss the phones in the front seat and ill bounce or I'll come back in about 10 min with deputy dipsh*t and see how that goes.\n\nRealizing the situation, they threw all 3 phones in the front seat and the last time I saw them in person was when they were flipping me off in my rear view mirror. I was only in that way of life for about 3 months before checking into a detox center to make sure I was ok while getting all those toxins and chemicals out of my body. I have seen first hand what it does to people and have never wanted to or came close to touching that sh*t again for as long as I live. \n\nJ died of cancer shortly after robbing his 68 year old grandmother of over 20k in jewelry a few years back. Everyone else in the family wanted nothing to do with him and that's why because in the end he only cared about himseld. I've seen Ts mugshot posted at least 3 times a year since that day and he looks 60 now even though he's younger than I am and he hired a gutter bum to set his house (yes the crack house) on fire for the insurance money. Little did he realize that the bum accidentally caught himself on fire during the scam/fraud and spilled the beans the minute the fire department and police arrived on scene. I think he's in federal custody now. As for F she vanished about 2 or 3 years ago and one can only come to the worst case scenario when that happens especially leaving behind 3 kids under 10 yrs old while being an active user and homeless all at the same time. \n\nMyself on the other hand, couldn't be more grateful that even if it was only 3 months, I took away a lifetimes worth of knowledge when it comes to people and environments like that which feed on ill will and abuse. Misery loves company and that's why strip clubs and crackhouses are open 24 hrs a day.\n\n(I had no criminal history and still don't and had NO CLUE if that chubby sheriff even worked for that town anymore nor did I have anyone waiting at my house and they very well could have gotten away with taking everything including me but I know tweakers are paranoid, tedious and resourceful in the sense that if I hadn't have taken those phones and simcards out and destroyed all 3 after reporting them lost/stolen, they could have either found out where my house really was or where my parents lived or worked. You can put a tweaker inside a haystack and not only will they find the needle, they'll stack and sort the hay by grade and color..frikin spooks man.\n\nAlso a disclaimer: this isn't a \"one time I was a badass\" story as these people helped me get hopelessly addicted to a drug/drugs I had no idea how powerful of an addiction they caused but also I was bankrolling their habits too because I wanted friends in my life and those are the type you can buy with drugs. 2 weeks before the whole \"leave em on the side of the road\" thing happened I got jumped in a drug deal, had my left orbital socket fractured from whatever they hit me with and the cherry on top was I pissed myself after the first hit with whatever broke my eyesocket..I mean I'm not even saying it was a fear squirt or anything I totally pissed myself, down both legs, it was a full bladder evacuation 😆 so yes, I'm not Mr. Cool guy or whatever I just outsmarted meth heads who'd been up for too long and wanted to rob and kill me.",

            "text": "Super late to this, but wanted to share as felt like I needed to.\n\n\nAfter having just been dumped by my partner at the time, my mother offered for me to move back home. Her partner lived there with her at the time. \n\nHe was delusional (he was projecting on to me), and thought I had moved back home to steal things & money from my mother, that I had racked up 1000s in debt and would bring bailiffs to the door, that I was a drug addict and an alcoholic. \n\nHe had been getting angrier and angrier every day, every time he saw me. He started shouting at me all the time about these things, threatening me, telling me to fuck off out of my mother's life because just being in it I was hurting her, that I was a waste of space, and other random shit I can't remember. This went on for months, maybe 4 or 5. I told my mother all the time but he had manipulated her so much that she wasn't sure who or what to believe. He'd painted me in this picture somehow that she stopped trusting me. I would never hold that against her, she a kind and gentle person, easy to take advantage of. I understand. \n\nDuring this time he was taking my things and selling them, keeping the money so he could \"pay off your (my) debt (which didn't exist)\", he even sold my car to someone! I know, I should have done something about this, (but my mother was so brainwashed by this man that she brushed it aside. *I think* he had convinced her that I did have debt, me and him had agreed to sell my stuff to pay it off and that I was denying this so she would leave him? I don't ask my mother about it because I just don't want her to have to think about him ever again tbh), and I was just so drained and broken by his daily verbal, mental, emotional abuse & still being quite sore about being dumped, that I just accepted it honestly.\n\nHe was also calling my friends, where he got their phone numbers from I will never know, telling them I was talking shit behind their back, asking if I'm on drugs and all sorts of madness.\n\nIt's honestly just like he was on a mission to ruin my fucking life. \n\nOne day he must have just snapped. My mother was at work, and I'd just finished work and come home. He asked me to sit down as he wanted to talk to me about something, so I sat down on the couch, very relaxed - he wasn't being aggressive or shouting for once. I could hear him in the kitchen rummaging around in the cutlery drawer shouting to me \"I'll be in in a second, just grabbing something\", and this is when I got suspicious. What the fuck could he be looking for in there? But by the time I thought to get up and get the fuck out of there he was in front of me with *MY* chefs knife, ordering me to sit back down. I complied, as he was pointing the knife at me. \n\nThe specifics don't really matter but he was accusing me of the things I mentioned above, and I wasn't sure what to think, just denied it all of course. At the time, I only drank alcohol on special occasions, hadn't done drugs, didn't have any debt and would never think of stealing from my own mother! He didn't accept that, and told me I'd been doing it all on the sly. So I just shut up and let him rant on. He proceeded to spit on me, push the knife into my throat (the worrying part was that it was my knife I had brought back home and religiously honed and sharpened so knew any pressure and I was gonna be dead), showed me some videos on his phone of him assaulting people, one of setting a person on fire (I don't know if they lived or died but never heard about it in the news, or if it was even in this country or town) and told me that was gonna be me before my mother got home. He proceeded to slap me in the face, with the knife still at my neck, multiple times. He was throwing stuff at me, some cushions, some wood for the fire, and tools for the fire, like pointy pokers and shit. The cushions missed me but of course the wood and metal stuff all hit me on the head. He didn't throw this stuff so hard it was going to cut or bruise, but it still hurt. I remained calm as I didn't want to antagonise him any more. I'm not sure why but he moved away from me mid rant and started to turn around. I saw this opportunity and I ran!\n\nI ran up the stairs to my bedroom and dragged my little single bed in front of the door so he couldn't get in. He was banging the door like a lunatic, accusing me now of being a paedophile (because I had an expensive gaming PC at the time I think was his reasoning - and I refused to let him sell it, or give him the password so he could sell it while I wasn't home. It was just the only joy I had in my life and I wasn't going to let him take that) and tell me he is going to set the house on fire and trap me inside. Idiot didn't realise there was a small roof that covered our front door right under my roof. So I called a friend and jumped on to the roof and then on to the ground, luckily my friend was only a couple of minutes away at home and the guy was still outside my bedroom screaming. My friend had some mechanics tools in his car and got a torque wrench (I think, it was just a big piece of metal to me at the time), stormed in my house and told him something I don't remember, and we left.\n\nI called my mother immediately and told her what happened. I didn't want her to come home to that mental person and would have rather phoned the police but again she was so manipulated that she didn't know whether to trust me or not. I should have phoned the police but was too scared honestly. He had managed to get in my room and moved the bed back, closed the window, he'd tidied the room he had me in and stuff so there was little to no evidence it happened. Months and months go by and they're living their \"happy\" life. I saw my mother sometimes following this, and she seemed happy and safe. I was too scared to do anything about it and still hate myself for letting my mother stay with him for so long and that I didn't call the police immediately. I was just so shaken up by this shit. No one really believed me when I told them except my dad, who was in ill health and the time so couldn't offer much help. Thanks for believing me dad! The friends he called believed me because they'd experienced him, so thanks guys! She would always call me and ask me to come over to make amends with this guy, or ask me to get him a job where I worked. Of course I didn't do any of this stuff. It was like my mother was in a cult, lead by this guy. Crazy stuff. \n\nMy friend let me live with him for a while until I could find somewhere else to go, he really looked after me for the few weeks I was there. I got an apartment with another friend, well he wasn't really a friend just an acquaintance at the time but we're good friends now and he believes me about all this stuff! \n\nAt some point my mother was in hospital for surgery. He didn't visit once. I visited every day. This is what woke my mother up, I think. When she returned home, a couple days earlier than expected(she didn't tell him she was coming home), she found her car gone, and his laptop open and not password protected. For whatever reason, she checked the laptop first - rather than phone the police about the missing car - as she was sure he was coming home as his laptop was open and his stuff was all here. She browsed his fb and insta messages and seen he had been cheating on her for *months*. She saw that he had arranged to be with someone else in another town. Some of her siblings stayed with her for a day or so (they'd taken her home from the hospital) until he returned from his trip. She kicked him out, threw his stuff out the window and he never came back. \n\nThis was years ago and he's out of our lives now. Someone my mother knows, also knows him (through a friend of a friend of a friend) and he's a long way away from us now. They won't give us his real name or any details (because the friend of a friend of a friend won't most likely), but doubt the police would do anything about this from years ago. I think he's using a fake name anyway, as he always refused to open a bank account, register at the Dr surgery, always used cash, that sort of thing. He wasn't from our town. No way of really knowing but seems reasonable to suspect that. \n\nI never thought something like this would affect me, but I ended up abusing prescription pain killers, some illegal drugs, alcohol and having a really bad time. I had night terrors, I was paranoid, I swear I saw him wherever I went. It's not as extreme as some stories in this thread, but it fucked me up for a while and I am absolutely positive he was going to kill me that day. The months of abuse probably fucked me up the most.\n\nSo, these things:\n\n>He was delusional (and I later learned he was projecting on to me for some bizarre reason), and thought I had moved back home to steal things & money from my mother, that I had racked up 1000s in debt and would bring bailiffs to the door to collect the debt and they would take my mother's belongings, that I was a drug addict and an alcoholic.\n\nI found out later off my mother that he was drinking around 16 pint cans of lager a day, smoking weed, popping my mothers pain killers, and sniffing something she didn't know what it was (never seen him only heard him do it), and yes she eventually got lots of letters from debt collection agencies as he'd racked up over 20,000 in debt! My mother also found some of her family jewellery missing.\n\nAll in all, a shitty scenario that I'm glad is behind me, I feel like I'm over it but it still crops up every now and then. I'm sure I'll heal eventually but I'm doing fine, so I'll take that. \n\nMy mother and Is relationship is good, I'd never hold that shit against her as he manipulated her to the extreme. He never hurt her, mentally or physically, just poisoned her against me really badly and cheated on her a bunch.\n\nSorry if it is a bit disjointed, I typed it out, kept going back to add details in when I remembered stuff. I haven't spoken about this in a long time.",

I’ll explain.\n\nWe were kids, 12-13 or so, and skipped the last class of the day by hiding in the bathroom and waiting for the teachers to go into their classrooms so we could sneak outside the building. He told me about “the pass out game” (that was the common name, he actually called it “space monkey”) and wanted me to try it. This involved having me breathe in deeply, then exhale fully while bending over…When my lungs were empty I stood up abruptly and he strangled me. Continued until I started seeing black ink drops on my field of vision and passed out. Here’s where the story diverges.\n\nFrom what I remember: everything went black and I felt like I was flying, spinning, soaring. In the distance I saw a small object vibrating. As I flew closer, it started giving me the nauseating “that doesn’t look right” feeling you get seeing a bone out of place in an injury. I realized I was looking at myself, writing, like I was doing violent sit-ups with no rhythm or regard for my safety. I knew that I was watching myself dying and that this felt bad. I flew down into my body and woke up. \n\nMy friend and another student who had entered the bathroom shared their reaction as I woke up: “Dude you fell and hit your head on the urinal and then started having a seizure on the floor! Flopping around like a fish outta water and hitting your head on the floor!” The second student that came in and watched (big dude, D1 football player at a well known college some years back now) had kicked me in the torso and revived me out of it somehow I guess. \n\nSo I’d apparently fallen forward after blacking out, hit my head, and started having a near death experience during my seizure. When I abruptly woke up, I jumped to my feet and looked around wildly with red eyes. I had amnesia briefly and didn’t recognize myself in the mirror. My face looked scrambled and foreign. Not only did I not know who I was, I didn’t know **what** I was. Gradually, reality came back in layers. You’re that thing. You’re alive. You’re this body. Your name is X. You were just in an accident. \n\nI blacked out again and fell over, then woke up and had a sudden urge to go home. Class was being dismissed and the hallways flooded with teenagers ready to get out of school, as I wandered to my locker. My friend saw me in the hallway and looked confused at my demeanor; I grabbed him and said “I had a seizure” and walked off. Got my things from my locker and walked home a couple miles. \n\nSaw the dude again years later, we hung out. He said sorry for killing me and I forgave him, and we haven’t talked in many years since. Life is weird.",

            "text": "When I was 11, I had begged my father to adopt a stray dog who followed me to school everyday (and even hid beneath my desk during class) from the street, let's call him Rover. Rover was more or less 3 years old, he was the sweetest dog you can imagine, he cried in sadness when I left home and also cried in happiness when I arrived. But he was very aggressive exclusively towards elderly men. Other dog owners told me that he likely suffered abuse from a person fitting that profile.\n\nFast forward 3 years... Through love and care, Rover was able to overcome his trauma and was not aggressive anymore. Just to be sure that Rover wouldn't harm anyone, when I released him from the leash so that he could play my father told me make him wear a muzzle.\n\nIn the building beside to the one where I lived, a middle aged arab man (EDIT; no hate whatsoever for people of that or any other origin)  and his family had just moved. Let's call him Amin. My older teenage brothers and their friends started hanging out at Amin's house, because he sold them weed. But soon they stopped hanging out with him because they found out he was a total piece of sh\\*\\* who beat and abused his wife and kids regularly.  My brothers told me that he was always ordering his 2 sons not to go anywhere near dogs 'as they were impure animals'.  As a result, when they saw a dog they were utterly terrified.\n\nThe following happened in an evening during school summer holidays. My parents and brothers were away at work and school, so I was with my grandma. God how I miss her...\n\nIn that evening I was hanging out with 2 of my pals in the cul de sac near my home. When I left home, Rover started crying like crazy because I would always bring with me to chill with my friends and in that evening I decided not bring him with me for some reason. Since my grandma knew that I was just meters away, she put on the muzzle on Rover's snout and released him with the leash so that he would come to me, as she had done countless times.\n\nAs Rover came to meet me, Amin's oldest son appeared with a bag of groceries in his hand. He was about 20/30 meters away from Rover when he started screaming and running. Rover acknowleged his presence when he screamed and proceeded to run after him. In panic, Amin's oldest son was almost ran over by a car as he ran frenetically on the road. As this happened, Amin was at the window and witnessed the whole thing.\n\nI promptly ran as fast as I could in order to get Rover and try to calm down the boy. As I picked up Rover, Amin appeared  and gave me a huge slap on the back and, when I turned over, he slapped me hard on the face. I had grown to be a robust teenager, and coming from a bad neighborhood I was taught from an early age by my brothers not to take sh\\*\\* from nobody so I charged my hook and delivered a swift blow to Amin's face. He was caught unprepared. He never expected a 13 year old boy to fight back. In rage, as he picked up his glasses from the floor and ran to his house with his son by the hand he told me: 'stay here I'm gonna kill you for this! I'm gonna water you with gasoline!'\n\nI had heard from my brothers what this man was capable of, he was a violent man. He knew where I lived. He knew my brothers and parents were away...\n\nI told my friends to stay sharp and call me if they see him do anything. Looking back, I should've just called the cops right there but I was just a kid. I ran home with Rover beneath my arm, he had no clue of what had just went down. As arrived home, I proceeded to lock all doors and windows. And told my grandma to go to our neighbors house through the back door. In less than 5 minutes I get a call from one of my friends: 'RUN AWAY!! He just opened the trunk of his car and put on gloves up to his elbows. He has a huge knife in one hand and a white bottle in the other hand and he is coming to your house'!\n\nAs soon as I hung up the call I heard him screaming out filled with rage 'IM GONNA KILL YOU IM GONNA KILL YOOOUUUUUUU!!!'. My grandma started crying and asked what was going on. I told her to just go the neighbors house I will be ok. Outside I heard Amin busting up everything he could looking for Rover. As this happened my elderly neighbor opened her door and pulled my grandma in while she was crying. As the door closed I went back into my house, with Rover still underneath my arm, oblivious as to what was going on. I opened the kitchen drawer and pulled out the biggest knife I could find. I though to myself I'm gonna put Rover in the living room and close the door. He will start barking and that will lure Amin, then I'm gonna hide in the cranny next to the door and stab him in the back until he stops moving.\n\nAs I pulled out the knife, Amin threw a rock and smashed the windows. I was then able to see him. He was not alone. In the back I could see his 2 sons witnessing his dad attempting to commit murder, they were scared as hell. Seeing their faces made me change my mind, I don't want them to see me kill their dad or their dad killing me. So I did what was right and ran like hell through the back door. As I ran one my pals was ringing my phone. I didn't pick up, he then dropped a message. He told me to run to a local coffeeshop and hide in the bathroom. The owner of the coffeeshop knew me and my family and had my back. I proceed to hide there until the police showed up.\n\nWhen the police showed up I went back to my house only to find that it was all busted up. He destroyed dishware, opened drawers and removed all their contents. All the doors were busted as he had kicked them in. All the glass from the windows was shattered. The police were out looking for him but he was laying low elsewhere since his car was not parked.\n\nWhen my father got home he could not believe what had just went down. My family was a working class family, my father worked hard to put food on the table and clothes on me my brothers bodies, so this was a major blow for was. Even though he was furious, my father knew not to fight violence with more violence. He is indeed a wise man. My brothers...Not so much. In that night, without telling my father, they went to Amin's house with an hammer and axe, busted open his door and entered his house... All they found was his wife crying with their children in her arms, begging not be killed.  They apologized and left.\n\nA week later he appeared briefly and tried to run me over with his car, me and my pal tried to take me out of his car gta style but he reached for a screwdriver so we ran away. After that I didn't hear from him again, until after 2 years I heard the news that he passed away from a heart attack. His wife and kids still live in the same house to this day. His widow is so scared of him that she started crying in fear when a neighbor made a joke about Amin being reincarnated into a pigeon that was following her.\n\nAnyways Rover lived a long happy life. Where ever you are Rover I will never forget you my dear pal",

He had lost my favorite jacket at a festival two weeks before that move. It was a limited edition that was no longer on sale and also cost $150, so it was pretty pricey for us broke college students. He offered to replace it for me as my \"birthday gift.\" IMO, replacing something you lost isn't a \"gift\"-- it's the bare fucking minimum a decent person should do-- but I wasn't going to, err, look a gift horse in the mouth, as it were. I picked out a different jacket from the same vendor and it arrived at our apartment two days before my birthday.\n\nHe had a long history of aggressive, violent behavior towards me, but I tried so hard not to judge him for it or hold it against him because he was both bipolar and autistic. The day before my birthday, he had what I can only describe as a psychotic break. I got home from work and he started accusing me of trying to murder him and begging me not to hurt him. This was the final straw for me. I told him that even though we had just signed another lease together, I wasn't willing to continue living with him because he was completely divorced from reality and it wasn't my job to be his therapist. Either he could leave or I would find someone to sublet my room, but I wasn't going to deal with his bullshit anymore. I grabbed the jacket and went to my bf (now husband 🥰)'s house for the night to get away from him.\n\nAt 9am the next morning, he texted me demanding I return the jacket he \"gave\" me (even though it was replacing one he lost) because I was abandoning him and didn't deserve it. When I got home, we immediately started screaming at each other and it quickly devolved into a physical altercation. I am very slim and not at all athletic; he had a black belt, so I was wildly outclassed. He got me into a Full Nelson and started choking me. I slammed my hand repeatedly on the ground trying to tap out but he wouldn't let go. My vision started to dim and I thought, \"holy shit. Is this really how I'm going to go?\" My entire bladder unloaded itself involuntarily. It wasn't until he noticed the pool of piss spreading on the floor that he finally let me go.\n\nHe moved out a few days later and I never saw him again. I was completely fucking traumatized, so I sought out both a psychiatrist and a therapist. It took me years of therapy to even be able to speak his name out loud. I have finally been able to come around to viewing it through a more positive lens. After all, it directly resulted in me getting psychiatric treatment (which is how I learned that I, too, have Bipolar Disorder, as well as ADHD) and it got him out of my life forever. My most toxic relationship, somehow with someone I never even dated.\n\nJacob, I know you're on reddit. If you're out there, know that I hope you fucking rot in hell.",

            "text": "My (now ex) husband was very emotionally and physically abusive. He used to pin me down and tell me that he would chop my body up in little pieces and hide them in the walls so that no one would ever find me, and that our child would never know their mother. His mom was an FBI agent and her boyfriend ran security for the governor, and they had already helped get my ex out of multiple DUI and various assault charges. He told me he would get away with it, and I believed him. He was 22 and I was 17. I got pregnant and we didn’t want to be separated when he got stationed on the other side of the country, so we got married and I went with him. \n\nHe was active duty military at the time of this incident, and we lived on base so we dealt with the MP’s not the state police. He was very drunk and accused me of cheating/being a whore (typical accusations) and threw me over the back of the couch while I was holding our 6 month old baby. He is 6’4 and I’m 5’ tall, at the time I weighed around 110 lbs. I got knocked out, and woke up in the hospital. He had tried to choke me, and I assume kill me. The neighbors heard me screaming, called security forces, and one of the male neighbors came into my house and stopped my ex. I don’t remember any of that specific fight after I hit the ground. The last thing I remember is him charging toward me and curling my head/arms around my baby and begging him to stop. \n\nIn the struggle that night I had bitten my Ex’s hand near his thumb so hard that I had broken the skin.  He used this to tell the MP’s that I had attacked him first and he was defending himself. This was not the first time that they were called to our house, and they knew that my bruises and marks weren’t accidental at that point. \n\nOur child was temporarily taken from us by the state and I had to prove that I was a fit parent to get them back.  My ex husband was stripped of his rank. He had to live in the single barracks for 30 days and they gave us a 30 day “no contact order”. That was it. No actual charges. \n\nI left him shortly after the no contact order was up when it was clear he wasn’t going to change, and he blamed me for losing his ranks/pay.  I had to get help from neighbors and sneak out while he was on a 12 hour shift. He typically took my dependent ID and wallet with him to work so that i was stuck at home, so I made up an excuse that we had to go to the off base Walmart for diapers and formula and he let me take my wallet, ID, keys, etc. I had given bags of clothes to a neighbor while he was working the day before, and after I dropped off my ex, I parked my car in a storage unit and the neighbors took my child and me to the airport. I called him on our layover and told him that i had left him, and that he would receive divorce papers shortly. When we got divorced he was so loud and obnoxious in court and harassed me constantly, so much so that the judge awarded me a restraining order and allowed that we put in our decree that he had to stop harassing me.  That all happened in 2007. He still harasses and  bullies me. He has taken me to court multiple times, even made accusations that I was a drug addict (because I have a medical marijuana card)  and I had to go through a big home study to prove I wasn’t. \nI do believe that if I hadn’t been able to fight back and my neighbor hadn’t come to the house I would be dead right now. When someone tells you they’re going to kill you almost every day, it starts to become a part of life that you deal with. I guess I should have believed him and tried to leave sooner. \nI still have PTSD from what I experienced (among other things, my life has been pretty fucked up I guess), I go to therapy regularly and was able to move on and have a healthy relationship. My current husband doesn’t really know all of what I went through, but he knows enough to have my back completely around my ex, and more than once has told my ex to watch how he speaks to me, etc. My child just turned 15. I figure I have 3 more years of direct contact, and then I’m “free”. **edited to reflect accurate year that it happened. It was late 2007, not in 2008.",

It was incredibly warm in there and people were rough, pretty much a typical Travis concert. It ended around 11PM and my friend and I immediately went across the street to this 24/7 corner store to buy some water. After making our purchase, we exited the store and outside we were confronted by this man who was pleading to us to help him as he kept saying he “got stabbed in the face”. The man was about 5ft5 and had his hand covering his cheek; he showed us the wound and there was a hole in his cheek about the diameter of a pencil. I was concerned for him and asked if he’d like me to call the number for an ambulance, he kept insisting not to and that he could take me to a store that sells bandages.\n\nBefore letting him lead me to the store that sells bandages, I went back into the corner store and looked to see if they had bandages in there; they did. However, the man kept refusing those bandages and said it had to be a special kind of wrapping which was “only available in the store round the corner to the left” (this direction is important). This started to get fishy but I just went with it and started to follow the man outside. My friend could speak Urdu as a British Pakistani, as the man and I left the store, the shopkeeper pulled my friend to the side and told him in Urdu, “your friend is about to be stabbed and killed, that man is part of a gang”.\n\nThe man and I were about 20 meters away from the corner store we left and he said it would be the next right…However, only 1 minute earlier I remembered him saying the turn would be on the left not right. This is went reality struck me and I got a massive pump of adrenaline as my heart sinked. There was now one accomplice of his to the left of me while the man with the hole in his cheek was to my right. My friend shouted my name, and at that moment he told me he saw the man to the left of me bring out a kitchen knife and as he was about to thrust it into my kidney area, I immediately ran forwards and then sprinted across the road before immediately sprinting back to the concert area. My friend later told me he was convinced that the knife would have impaled me and he was dialling police. \n\nThe feeling was surreal, it was like a deep human instinct for survival kicked in and the situation I got myself into became so clear, it was like time slowed.",

They came out of their cars holding metal spears ( I shit you not 😅) we totally out numbered them so we rush them. They realized their odds and got back in their cars and try to leave. We threw rocks and whatever we can as they made their exit. \nCelebrating what we thought was a victory, some of us ditched and went to the local pool hall for the rest of the school day. So around 230, I hopped into my friends car and drove back to our school to drop off another friend (3 of us). As we approached our school the driver said, lets go hunting for these fools in case they still around. \nSure enough as soon as the driver opened his mouth, those same cars from earlier has spotted us and gave chase. Our drive who was acting tough, realized he was not so tough and try to make an escape. But instead of turning into the school he turned into the neighborhoods. After a few minutes, we ended up on an overpass of the highway (where cars were either exiting or entering the highway). \nStuck at a red light behind about 5 cars. I was alone in the backseat, when all of a sudden the back window blew out. The driver, exited the car so fast he forgot to put it on park. He exits and ran!!!\nThe passenger opened his door and put his hands up\n“You got the wrong guys”, he said \nThe guys chasing us, ran towards our car and surrounded me, holding those damn metal spears. They whacked and beat the shit out of the passenger as he had his hands up. Then they turned to me, I tried to open the door on the right side, but that window blew out and shattered the glass on me. I closed the door and try to make my exit on the other side, but had the same result. Dodging spears from both side and thought to myself, I’m fucked!\nLuckily, the car started rolling forward (because the driver that ran never put it on parked) hits the car in front of us and seeing what was happening behind them, all drove off. My car started rolling towards the intersection. I had to make a decision because everything was happening too fast. \nSo I jumped out of the slow moving car right before it got to the intersection and thank god because it got Tboned. Before I could even gather myself. I saw this guy running towards me with his hands pointing at me. I heard a pop and another pop. Without thinking, I ran towards the edge of the overpass and jumped over it. I rolled down the hill where cars were exiting the freeway. Took a nice tumble, but it saved my life. \nI climbed back up to check on the passenger because last I saw he was laying there in his own blood. I made it up and grabbed him and dragged him into the near sporting goods store. Went inside, grabbed a bat and waiting in the backroom until police showed up. Everyone survived, driver was unharmed, but sadly still friend’s with. Passenger came out with a few broken bones. And I was also unharmed.",

Combined not working with unemployed benefits paying out every two weeks I was an accident waiting to happen. What happens when clinically depressed, weak willed vulnerable people with a penchant for making friendships as well as doing drugs on top of all that? NOTHING GOOD is the answer NOTHING.\n\nAbout 4 months into the layoff I was climbing the walks out of boredom and since it was the middle of winter, it wasn't like I could go make a quick buck mowing lawns or whatever and it hadn't snowed much so shoveling driveways was out of the question as well. Cue to the txt I'd received to give a lift to this guy we'll call \"J\" and how it literally changed the course of my life for the next year.\n\nJ needed dropped off in the worst part of town, late at night, all while being 3 white guys, who nobody knew (included in the car was another guy named \"T\") and who barely knew eachother and only through drugs are these types of bonds forged. (Cocaine is a helluva drug) at this point in the bed time story I'd like to mention I'd experimented with coke and ecstacy with a little H thrown in there for good measure but I wasn't on the same level J and T were no no no my friends, I hadn't even looked under the bed yet and was stills scared of the dark compared to the degradation and filth those hardened gutter slime had already been desensitized to years before I'd met them. These guys were on a \"pickpocket a drive by victims pockets for loose change\" type of characters.\n\nJ took off walking after getting \"close enough\" to his destination and handed me a $50 bill that seemed fake when I touched it and T \"knew of a place\" to get hard drugs at 3:00 a.m. in the ghetto, I figured that since no cashier in their right mind would take this counterfeit note as well as being a crime to try to use it, I'd just send T down the alley and if I hear gunshot I'll know the fake $50 scam didn't work 😆 or the other option was to wait for him no more 10 min and realizing he's not coming back I'd just drive home because I'd only lost out on the bit of gas for a ride to the city and conversation with human people for that matter so I wasn't about to go look good for them and know when to cut my losses.\n\nLow and behold T's silhouette appears tromping down the alley at a pace which said, we're about to be on a different planet. Before I even asked him what he was able to get he would only reply, \"you'll see man you're gonna be happy I promise\" from there I really had no choice and wasn't abouts to get busted using whatever he's got ahold of in the car so we went back to his \"house\" which was essentially a rotted out structure with no running water and busted out windows letting the winter chill in. I wasn't trying to judge though because (cocaine is a helluva drug) I'd been in houses like that and they're usually referred as \"shooting galleries\" for IV users. So, T throws what I thought was a broken golf ball onto the cheap plastic table and couldn't make out what it was because it was wrapped so tight. CRACK ...it was totally crack. Immediately my stomach did a flip and my hands got shaky because I'd never tried, purchased, sought after or even ask anyone for crack. I was always a opioid/downer type of person because I'm naturally high strung normally.\n\nSo, I took what those who still suffer from the affliction called a \"Bell Ringer\" in my naivety by hitting it like someone would smoke weed and BOY O BOY was that the wrong thing to do! I almost simultaneously projectile vomited, sh*t my pants, had a mild stroke and broke out in hives all at the same time.\n\nCut to 2 months from that initial trial run and the decline of my unemployment benefits coupled with everyone in that house being severely impoverished on account of their habit. If you'd give them $10 to buy their kid a happy meal they'd come back with a $10 crackrock and a bologna sandwich from the local food pantry. It was that bad. Non of them had jobs, cared about their house or children or even their own personal hygiene. Ugh..the stories I have from only staying there for 3 months maximum could fill a book but without further adue. The day I almost died.\n\nT and J had already made plans staying up for 4 or 5 days straight at this point in order to get everything they needed together which they so lovingly referred to as the \"Murder Bag\". It was a red reebok duffle bag filled with hatchets, iron pipes, box cutters, nylon rope and lye. They were so high on meth and crack both that they went through the bag literally right in front of me without taking notice of my presence. Their \"mastermind\" scenario was to hide my car keys that I'd been clutching every night in case I had to bale, drive my car with me in it to my parents house, convince my parent's to open a legitimate bank safe built into the floor in order for me to get my car title, birth cert and SS# and then magically drive away with no questions raised. After obtaining my proof of birth and other info they were going to take me to a title loan place and try and get at least $1200 Immediately and they didn't bother to check I could have drawn 7k for a loan. Either way, car title money in hand they would have taken me back to their shack and into the attic. Over the next several days they'd beat, extort, rape and torture everything they could gain monetarily before using the murder bags contents as an expressive tool for their anger. After death I'd have been stuffed/lodged in one of the many holes in the attic that was an A-frame making it really easy to just slide me down into the insulation after plastic wrapping me for the smell and fluid that leaks out of all corpses. \n\nAll in all I'd say they would have gotten away with it for at least a year givin the state of the house being so disgusting but they'd also need to get rid of my car. If I get enough people that take the time to read this, I'll gladly explain how I beat them at their own game and why I'm still around and it's not them typing this. I don't want to bore anyone with it but will finish if anyone wants to know. Later gators 😁",

            "text": "About 16 years ago, I was leaving work to go to my last physiotherapy appointment (back injury). I worked in the heart of downtown, but physio was on the north side of town, so the quickest way to get there was to use the train (LRT) as the stations were close to work and close to the physio office, so I would not need to take the bus. As I got in to the train station I heard that my train was coming, so I ran down the stairs as fast as I could because if I missed this one then I would have to wait 20 minutes for the next one and that would make me late for my appointment. I got down to the bottom of the stairs at the train platform and turned towards the track where my train was coming in. As I turned towards the track, I suddenly felt 2 hands on the back of my coat pushing as hard as they could towards the tracks. With little to no time to process what was happening, all I was able to do was jump as best I could once I was at the ledge. I lept as far as I could, making it all the way to the other side of the tracks and the wall just as the train came rushing in to the station. It was such a close call that as I leaped across the track, the train struck one of my feet. It just grazed me as I got across to watch the train come screeching to a stop in the station. Once the train was fully stopped, I stepped up on the coupler in between the train cars and back on the platform where a group of other people were yelling \"He's right there!\" and pointing at the man who just tried to kill me. Filled with rage and a desire to remove his head from his shoulders, I started walking towards the man (who just sat down and tried to act like everything was fine) and thought to myself how I was going to end this fool for trying to do the same to me. As I got close to him, transit security appeared and stepped in between the man and I and potentially stopped me from committing a terrible crime. I even offered them $1000 each if they just turned around for a minute so I could at least give this guy the hardest haymaker punch I could muster, but they said there was cameras everywhere and it was just not possible. SO MAD. They then informed me that as transit security, they were only able to subdue the man once he was arrested and as there were no cops around it would have to be a citizens arrest and I had to be the one to do it. In order to do so I had to approach the man, tell him he is under citizens arrest, then make physical contact of some sort. I did exactly as the security said up to the point of making physical contact. When it got to that part of it, time froze and my mind ran the gauntlet of different scenarios about how I could possibly beat the piss out of this guy, but I was able to collect myself enough to realize that I am allergic to going to jail, so I just put my arm on the sleeve of his coat. Immediately after doing this, transit security cuffed him. While waiting for the cops, I asked him why he did that. His respense was \"George and Saddam told him he needed to do it, and that I was supposed to be his salvation. The security guards then searched him and in his coat pocket he had written a letter to the president of China, stating he needed more rice rations. Out of his damn mind! The cops came and took him away shortly after.\n\nHe was ordered to undergo a 30 day psychiatric evaluation. After that was done he was found not able to be tried due to mental issues, then freed back out to the public (WTF?). I found out shortly after he was released that he had done this before. 3 years prior, A woman who was 6 months pregnant was waiting for her train when he pushed her on to the tracks. She lost her baby because of it, but he got the 30 day psychiatric evaluation and found not capable of being tried because he was crazy, then released. What a joke. \n\nHow did it affect me? Well, I have not been on the train in 16 years. I also suffered from vivid nightmares for years about different ways I get killed on transit. Even to this day I still have a nightmare about it once every couple of months.",

It started when I was 19, a home invader who was an ex-boxer on meth tried to kill me and my family on the front porch of our home after he smashed it up in a random fit of rage (he’d beaten another man almost to death just before and the police were already looking for him.)\n\nHe had such a big size and drug advantage, I couldn’t hold him off long enough for him to not almost smash my head in with a big landscaping rock so I had no choice but to defend myself with a fishing knife I had on him.\n\nHe didn’t even notice and would not stop (he punched my Mum in the head so hard she got a huge lump the size of an egg and knocked her unconscious) until the blood loss finally affected him and he noticed he was pissing arterial blood.\n\nI wasn’t convicted of anything as it was a clear cut case of self defence but after he was free 2 years later, he first went to the media (a trashy tabloid show that’s not really news and never does any research to smear me, my family and even my band! a la cringey Hard Copy or PMRC stories.) The real news at least reported it accurately right after it happened.\n\nWe eventually were able to sue for defamation, it only covered our legal fees, we made no money but they were forced to remove the stories (2 of them) from their archives. They didn’t look into his criminal history (7 priors including assault and attempted murder.)\n\nIn the meantime after the attempted smear yielded nothing, he broke into my house and straight up tried to murder me in my house first by strangling me with a dog chain (I only survived that because I’ve had martial arts and security training and know how to get out of any strangulation which involves the garrotte being criss-crossed at the back which luckily it was) then tried to smash my head in with an iron fireplace poker. I prevented most of the blows making contact because it could have gone straight through my skull but the couple that landed required 27 stitches across my scalp and 8 more on my forehead which I now have quite a scar there for my troubles.)\n\nThe police, while they arrived in time to catch him red handed on the property after I eventually subdued him when his meth high wore off and the pain of my efforts to fight back finally got to him, but nowhere near in time to intervene.\n\nKnowing no-one was coming to help and that I was absolutely going to be killed if I didn’t act immediately, I cannot even describe. It’s the kind of thing every man thinks about but I wouldn’t wish on any man to find out it they could survive something like this.\n\nI don’t feel nearly as badass as I’ve been credited for. It all but broke me, ruined the life I had. I eventually came to terms that nothing would ever be the same and adapted but it’s not without its issues, major PTSD for one thing\n\nThis piece of shit struck my father with one of his weapons, cut his head open and dropped him to the ground, a then 62 year old man with a bad back, walking with a cane who did nothing wrong but try to protect his son.\n\nThe scumbag was charged with attempted murder with the option to plead guilty to trespass and aggravated assault with attempt to cause grievous bodily harm. He fired 5 lawyers in a row who told him there’s no way he would win at trial and he ought to plead guilty and lawyer number 6 finally got through to him.\n\nEven after dragging it out so long, he still only got 4 years reduced from 9 because of his sob story about his bad childhood and rough upbringing like it’s any excuse! In the meantime, the family completely dissolved, Mum went off the rails and abandoned us, my sister moved interstate and me being the only one left who visited Dad, cared about him and showed him I loved him, took his own life after one final phone call to “ask if everything was cool between us.”\n\nI went to check on him after not hearing from him in a day or so and found him dead in the bedroom of his flat. He took every medication under the sun that he had. He was a real one of a kind, amazing, generous, awesome king of a man who deserved better and not a day goes by that I don’t miss him. He died less than two months after my close friend hung himself.\n\nThe only good to come of it (I resent having to describe it that way) is that when my fiancés (who is the sweetest, most caring, lovely, wonderful, gorgeous and supportive person I’ve ever met and feel truly lucky and blessed to have)Dad died of cancer, I was familiar with and able to truly understand and guide her through her grief and we have an understanding about it that only we have. I do have positive things in my life and successes but sometimes nothing is enough to undo to damage or stop the pain.\n\nAnd that’s not even the only crazily traumatic thing that’s happened to me but it’s one of the major ones I can at least talk about. There’s more details that are just insane but it would take a long time to post and this is long enough already.\n\nTL;DR, had to fight for my life against a violent home invader attempting to murder me twice and it nearly ruined my life.",

I remember him turning to me and cold as ice explaining to me why I should jump. \n\nAt first I thought he was trying to show me how stupid my urge to self destruct was until his hands were locked around my wrists. \n\nWe were up on that bridge for hours with him desperately trying to get me over the railings while I pleaded with him to let me live and not die like this. I remember seeing peoples faces as they walked past silently begging them to realise I was in danger that it wasn’t just some lovers tiff but no one came to my rescue.\n\nAt one point he put me down knowing I was too exhausted from struggling to go anywhere and began grabbing my things my phone and bag. He was texting my mum as me telling her I was going to kill myself. I couldn’t believe it he had been planning this and I never once realised. He then called my mum from his phone pretending to be terrified for me and that he had lost me.

He seemed nice and started living with us after a while. One night she went out and he stayed home. He spent most of the night in our unfinished basement which was weird. She got home and they got in a fight about something and she asked him to leave. A little while later I heard noises downstairs. She went down to check it out and didn’t see anything out of order.

They came by and found his car down the road so they searched for him but he didn’t come out so they brought in a K9 to double check. Turns out he was hiding in our living room behind the entertainment center. He had previously moved everything in the room away from the walls ever so slightly so it didn’t even seem like anything was different at first but he did make room for himself to hide. After they arrested him they asked if our chest freezer in the basement was broken because all the food had been taken out. It wasn’t. The police assumed he spent the time in the basement prior to the fight taking everything out of the freezer to possibly hide our bodies in. They also discovered his car had stolen plates and the name we knew him by wasn’t his name. His ex wife had a restraining order on him also. He was charged with minor crimes and released. \n\nA few days later I came home from school and went upstairs to change. I came back down and noticed the basement door was open, it was normally always closed to keep the dog out. I scooped up the dog and ran to my car.

I had just gotten back home (was 21 at the time and in college) when they pulled up. He was belligerent and arguing with my mom. He pushed her and I got between them. Told him if he ever put his hands on my mom again, I’d put him down. Something along the lines of “how’d you like all your work buddies to know you got your ass handed to you by a girl).  \n\nI grabbed mom and we went to my bedroom, hoping he would fall asleep. He didn’t. Instead, he went outside and got a gun from his truck. I could hear his truck door open and close but it never started so I moved towards my bedroom door and slowly opened it to see where he was. He was standing with his back against the wall on the left side of my door, holding a Glock. \n\nI shut the door, locked it, told mom to hide behind a piece of furniture and call 911. I backed up to my desk where there was a snub nose .38 that the same drunken asshole had given me for protection when I was home alone (oh, the irony). I pulled the .38 from the desk just as he started trying to kick the bedroom door down. \n\nAs the door began to fall in towards me, I saw he start to lift up his gun and point it at me. Since I was stone cold sober, obviously my reflexes were faster. I got the .38 up and fired five rounds at him to his one round at me. \n\nDrunken asshole’s aim was way off so I lucked up. He, on the other hand, got two rounds in his face and one to the back when the first two spun him. The other two rounds went into the fall because HE TAUGHT ME how to lead (re: duck hunting). \n\nI remember talking to the 911 operator after checking myself for bullet holes. At first I was calm then I became a mess. Started asking what was going to happen to me. Shock has set in. Mom, the cucumber that she is, went out to make sure he was no longer a threat. \n\nTo everyone’s surprise, drunken douchecanoe was alive and was able to get up and HIDE his gun. He still had the presence of mind to try to make himself look defenseless. EMS arrived to find he had walked from my bedroom to the kitchen, leaving a trail of blood.\n\nI was taken to the local cop shop. The cop who drove me read me my rights and wouldn’t talk to me. That didn’t help my state of mind. When I got there, I gave my statement to the detective (hindsight: I should have asked for a lawyer regardless). \n\nWhen we finished, we walked out of the interrogation room and the detective put his arm around my shoulder and said he was “proud” of me. He said “most people, especially women (the fuck), would have frozen under that kind of situation and gotten hurt. You did the right thing. Never doubt that.”\n\nMy entire family was waiting for me. My paw paw (who taught me how to safely and proficiently use a gun) had made the hour drive to where I lived in less than half the time (I’m his only grandchild so, you know). \n\nI really don’t remember much after that other than going home and going to sleep in a room with a broken door. \n\nDrunken cockjockey lived. We had gone to the shooting range a few days earlier (more irony) and I hadn’t taken the “wad cutters” (paper rounds) out to replace them with the usual hollow point/home defense rounds. He lost his left eye, needed plates in his face and head, had a punctured left lung, and developed pneumonia in the hospital (that almost killed him). I missed his aorta by a hair, allegedly. \n\nFucked up part?  Mom actually stayed with him for almost another two years. She moved me out and paid for my apartment so she could be with that drunken moose knuckle. You could imagine the kick in the crotch that was. \n\nMom became a better human being after she finally left him and realized how she treated her only child. It’s been over 20 years since that all went down and I’ve long since forgiven her but she still feels guilt.

While in the hospital, he made a statement to the police that he was 100% at fault. He later tried to recant (his mom got to him) but the cops told him to kick rocks.

I asked him what he wanted and he mumbled something and then just ran away. I was confused but moved on with my day. That night, at around 2 in the morning, I heard glass breaking and footsteps. I peeked out the door to my bedroom and saw that weird guy from earlier walking around calling my name out. He spotted my head through the crack in the door and ran over to me and pointed a gun at my head and told me to turn around. I was screaming and he hit me and told me to shut up and take off my clothes. I was sobbing and started taking off my clothes when I heard another pair of footsteps. It turned out to be my neighbor. Now, let me describe my neighbor. 6 foot 6, 260 pounds of muscle, ex military guy. Lets call him John. Dude also had an entire arsenal of guns. I heard him yelling out something(I don't remember what, I assume it was asking what was going on) and then gunshots. The creepy guy hunched over and ran out of the house while limping. My neighbor ran over to me and started checking on me, asking if I was okay and such. Once he figured out that I wasn't physically hurt, he pulled out his phone and called 911 and stayed with me till the police arrived. At first they thought he was the bad guy cause he looks scary and had a gun, but I managed to explain the situation. \n\nJohn came over the next morning and brought me a cake. We talked for a bit and eventually I invited him over for dinner. We have now been married for 4 years :)\n\nA few days after the guy tried to kill me the police found the home invader in a stolen car. He also had a bunch of clothes belonging to various women(no idea how he got them, but I can only assume the worst). Now hes serving 70 years for various convictions including attempted murder, assault, breaking and entering, etc.",

He showed up at my house 20 minutes later. I lived in the hood and he climbed a 10’ fence to get onto the property. He violently banged on all the windows and doors screaming “YOU DON’T GET TO LEAVE ME!” I cracked open the door (with the chain still on and my gun in hand) and asked him to leave. He kicked my door open, rushed me, punched me, pulled chunks of my hair out and choked me until I passed out. He is 6’4” and I am only 5’1” so I can’t reach his body but I’m clawing at his arms til I’m blacked out. When I finally wake up, he’s sitting on my bed and crying with my gun against his head. I think he thought I was dead?\n\nIt took me an hour of telling him whatever he wanted to hear before he finally put the gun down, acted like nothing happened and left. I cried by myself for a few hours until I got a call from another guy I had been seeing, an attorney. I bawled my eyes out to him, he picked me up and helped me get a restraining order. The neighborhood gang said they caught him trying to scale the fence, pulled him off and roughed him up a little. I moved and changed jobs. My old landlord told me while he was sprucing up the place for the next tenant he came back and was screaming my name outside the house and left when he came out and said I no longer lived there.\n\n6 years later I got a FB message from a woman who moved in with him shortly after this incident. I gather from this timeline they must have began dating while we were dating. I think there was some sort of background check to move in together so he explained the dvro (I didn’t pursue assault charges, just the restraining order) as us being just friends, having an argument and me being some sort of vengeful psychopath and lying to law enforcement that he attacked me. Basically saying I was some Asian Karen who wielded my Asian privilege against a Black man. So she got this place with him believing his story and less than a month later she realized he was all bad when he punched his own dog and threatened to kill her cat. She tried to break up with him and he locked her in the bathroom and tortured her for over 6 hours - choking her with cables and cutting her all over with a knife. He had an erection while he was doing it. And then he got a phone call from his parents. He took it in the living room, she escaped, and people on the street helped her.\n\nThey gave him a fairly light sentence because the judge had some sympathy for him as a veteran. He got out of prison and she saw him on the street. She reached out to me to warn me that he was out after basically cyberstalking me for years wondering what really happened.",

They looked at each other and started up the stairs.\n\nI shot the first one right in the chest, later found out it went through his heart. He kind of gasped and then went down. I'm pretty sure he died within a couple of seconds.\n\nThe other one started running up the stairs. I shot twice, hit him in the abdomen with one and the second went through his side, then into his pelvis and spine. He collapsed on the stairs. The sheriff got there about 10 minutes later and I'm pretty sure he was gone when they got there.\n\nWe found out later that they were on drugs and probably thought that the house was empty. \n\nI've always felt a little bit guilty because I didn't have much remorse over it. I wish that it didn't happen, but I'd do it again. I've got no doubts that they'd have killed me and done who knows what to my wife.",

Obviously my Mom was devastated by losing a parent at such a young age. She made sure that if she was ever in a scenario with her life on the line she would know what to do. \n\nFlash forward to my Mom being in her early 20s working as a cocktail waitress. She was walking to her car after a shift late one night when she realized a man was following her. He threatened her with a weapon and forced her into his car. My Mom, being the amazing woman she is, immediately started on keeping note of every little detail of what was going on. What sort of car were they in, how many miles on the speedometer, where they exited, the name of the motel he took her to. Every little detail.\n\nFrom there I have less details because it was the worst week of my Mom’s life and she really does not talk about it. She was assaulted by this  man countless times. In between she would talk to this man and pretend that she was falling in love with him and that she understood his problems. He would spill details about his life to her that she would make note of for later on. She learned his full  name, his wife’s full name, he lived on a nearby army base, etc. \n\nEventually he became enamored with her and decided to set her free back in the restaurant parking lot where he took her. My Mom immediately goes to the police and informs them of everything that happened. They picked him up a few days later and discovered he had killed someone since letting my Mom go. \n\nAt his trial his defense tried to use all the misogynistic plays in the book. My Mom was asking to be kidnapped and assaulted because she is so beautiful and how she was dressed (in her restaurant uniform). When my Mom took the stand and was able to refute so many of their claims because she had taken such meticulous mental notes of what had happened. The man was convicted back in the 70s and got out in the 2010s. \n\nDespite this horrible time in her life, my Mom is the happiest and sweetest person alive.",

I stepped in to try to mediate, knowing that if he went off on her she would be severely injured immediately. \nHe completely snapped and picked me up by my neck, holding me against the wall and yelling at me. I couldn't reach the ground but I was kicking him and trying to pry his fingers apart. I felt very faint but I managed to get him to drop me onto the couch where I tried to breathe and told him he needed to go for a walk to calm down. Thankfully he did, I guess he realized that he'd taken it further than he meant to. There were other outbursts but that one was the worst by far. \n\nNo authorities were involved because they always hung up on me when I called (I was a kid at the time) or if they did arrive, they believed he wasn't really a threat, just a good kid who had a bad day. My parents either didn't know or didn't believe me about this incident for a while, but we've since talked about it. I don't talk to that brother or my mom much and I've had plenty of therapy to try and deal with all the feelings I have (rage, distrust, sadness, guilt, etc).\n\nEDIT: A little update on my siblings' current situations. My brother was (mis)diagnosed and then poorly medicated as a kid, which led to him having a hard time regulating and understanding his own emotions; I don't fully blame him for having a tough time but I will never be in a closed space with him again. He has improved somewhat over the years, post-puberty especially. My sister still lives with him and our mother and they all have shitty attitudes towards life and horrible interactions with each other, but given that she's an adult now there's not much I can do for her.\n\nRe the authorities not helping, this is the norm. I was 16 at the time of that event, but had been shielding my younger sister from our brother's outbursts since I was 10 or so. At first I tried to call 9-1-1 but the operators must have thought it was a prank or not truly an emergency due to how young I sounded, so I eventually gave up trying to call them at all. If a neighbor heard something and called and the cops did arrive, my brother would either have left to go on a walk so there was nothing they could do, or they would ask for his story first because he's the oldest and the only male so they would believe him over us.

My friend immediately ran to his car and chased after the perpetrators, with the rest of us following suit. Once we caught up to the car, we discovered two youths around 18/19 who were completely unapologetic. Well, my friend did not like that so took the rest of his fireworks in his car and snapped it in two to teach him a lesson. That was that - we parted ways, with the driver saying \"Enjoy your night lads\" with a very chilling smile.\n\nI had a bad feeling from that moment but remained in the park with my friends to continue the celebration stupidly, despite saying to my mates we should leave.

Me, wanting to protect my car, and not realizing what was going on, stupidly went forth to my car in an attempt to get to it and drive away. My best friend came with me for some stupid reason. The rest of my friends dispersed, running away. Once I got to my car, I jumped in and my hand was shaking so much that I dropped my keys in between the clutch and my car seat. I was frantically trying to reach it, and was making a bit of commotion so much so that the attackers noticed that my friend and I were in the car and beckoned the other attackers over.

I obviously didn't jump out of the moving truck even though I didn't visually see the gun. He forced us back into my house where he raped my friend (his gf) in front of us as a threat. His gf was an innocent, abused party and I never blamed her for what happened. He made us watch while he took a baggie of cocaine out of his pocket and cut lines on my dresser, got super high and beat his gf.

I lived in an off campus apartment (on the ground floor) and it was a block off a major street here in Phoenix called Baseline. ​These details are important.  \n\nIn the summer of 2006, Phoenix Arizona was plagued by two serial killers. One was the \"Phoenix Shooter\" who ended up being a team of two guys randomly shooting people, and the other was the \"Baseline Killer,\" a rapist and murderer. Having two serial killers put the entire city on edge, and everyone was talking about it. I even saw articles in Time or Newsweek about the situation. \n\nSo, the Fall 2006 semester had just started. Now, you may have heard this, but Phoenix is HOT in August. It would get stuffy in my apartment, and so I'd leave the window cracked a little because the morning air is nice. The blinds provided visual cover.\n\nAnyways, one morning, a strange sound woke me up. It was the crack of dawn-4:45 am, and the sun was just barely coming up. It was the sound of someone lightly tapping on the window...and it seemed intentional. In my tired state, I figured it could be a bird or some branches or something trivial. \n\nTap tap tap...silence. \n\nAfter about 90 seconds of nothing, the tapping returned, and it was absolutely purposeful. I was positive it was a human producing this noise.  I thought it was my boyfriend, who thought it was cute to try and scare me sometimes. I decided I'd be a bit of a brat and make him wait, but I was also getting really angry:\n\n\"How dare he pull a prank when I'm trying to sleep! This is just like him. I'm going to give him a piece of my mind about disturbing my sleep like this.\"\n\nTap tap tap...\n\nAt a certain point, I got up to get a glass of water, still being in the mindset of wanting to annoy my stupid boyfriend who thought this would be funny. \n\nBut I saw some movement through the slit in the blinds, and I marched over and yanked the blinds so I could see:\n\nDefinitely. Not. My. Boyfriend. \n\nI said very loudly, \"What the FUCK?!\" He sort of seemed taken back by my anger, but only slightly.\n\nThe man I saw will be with me forever, or more specifically, his eyes and the feeling they gave me were insanely...CREEPY. Honestly, words can't do justice to how terrifying his eyes were. \n\nThey looked like black orbs with no white in them. Absolutely predatory. When I see pictures of Ted Bundy or Charles Manson, that's exactly what he looked like. Even if you saw a picture of how they looked, it's different when you experience it in person. It totally floored me-something about this man was profoundly WRONG.\n\nHe was crouched down, like an umpire. He had on dark pants, a dark purple shirt, and a dark Nike hat. \n\nHe had dark skin-I thought he was Hispanic, but later I found out he was a light skinned black guy (you'll find out how I learned his name later). \n\nAnyways, after I yelled \"What the FUCK\" at him, he whispers to me, \"Can I talk to you?\" If you want to know how insanely creepy that is to hear, just whisper that sentence out loud to yourself right now. It still sends chills down my spine when I think of how that sounded...\n\nHis hands subtly moved towards his waist. I later learned he would blitz attack his victims and he probably had a gun. All that separated us was a mesh screen. \n\nNow, this is about a 3 second interaction at this point. For some reason, I thought of Ted Bundy and how he'd pretend to be crippled to target his victims. I thought of my mom telling me to not be nice to strangers-don't be afraid to be a bitch. My thinking wasn't as \"calculated\" as all that, but it was more the nano-processing of how to deal with the situation. \n\nSo, when he whispered that, I started yelling at him: \"Hell no, get the FUCK out of here douchebag!!\"\n\nI shut the window angrily and locked it. I can’t over emphasize how incredibly irritated I was that this person had the audacity to disturb my precious sleep.  \n \nI laid back down and wondered if I'd been too mean. What if he needed help? But that didn’t really make sense.  Why would he be, like, tapping and whispering if he was truly in trouble?  I decided he was a creep after all. I was too annoyed to go back to sleep, but I sort of laid back back down. \n\nI told my room mate about an hour later and she sort of jokingly asked if it could've been the Baseline Killer....\n\nWhen she said that, my heart sank. His face looked exactly like it did in the police sketches that were on billboards EVERYWHERE. The only problem is that those billboards showed him with dreads, and the man at my window had no dreads. Apparently, he was some sort of disguise artist who'd wear wigs (updating the police sketch would've been a nice move, but they didn't.) \n\nI called the Phoenix Police, and the detective I talked to agreed that it sounded like his M.O. The suspect would say something to throw off his target, and then he'd blitz attack. The detective said that my angry response probably made me seem like too much of a hassle and moved on. The only problem was that I thought the guy looked Hispanic, and the detective said many witnesses described him as black. \n\nI thought they might want to come out and try for samples or surveillance video or something, but I didn't hear back from the detective.\n\nMy parents freaked out. Then got us knives, pepper spray, and put up signs. EDIT: Some ppl asked why I didn’t get a gun. I can’t remember why I didn’t at the time, but I remember it being something I was open to when my dad brought it up. \n\nWe learned another tenant had complained that same morning! I never learned the details, but this idiot was apparently going around the damn complex trying to find a target. \n\nThe stupid apartment wouldn't let us out of our lease, so we moved to a 2nd floor apartment right above our old unit (Sidenote: the neighbors who moved into our old unit were HORRIBLE. Obnoxious tweakers who would do meth and play Pitbull on repeat for hours and have knife fights at 11am on weekdays. There were times I wondered if they might be worse than the actual serial killer who came to my window. So, that unit was cursed somehow).  \n\nAnyways, on September 4, 2006, they arrested Mark Goudeau. I think the detective didn't call me back because they were days away from arresting Goudeau. \n\nWhen I saw his mugshot, I was sick but also relieved. He was absolutely the guy outside my window. To me, he looked like he could be Hispanic. You can judge for yourself if you google it. \n\nHe's on Death Row in Arizona now. His wife tried to mount some campaign to show that the police were framing him or something. On a personal level, it certainly would make for an interesting coincidence if this poor innocent man who they “framed” was also whispering like a creep and tapping my window.  \n\n​I can't think of something more scary than a serial killer tapping on your window. That actually happened to me, and if it happens to you, just scare them right back. Don't be afraid to be downright rude to someone who's injecting themselves into your space. It could save your life if you're not afraid to throw your weight around and tell someone off.  TRUST YOURSELF!\n\nYou can still be a kind and generous person and still tell someone to fuck off. \n\n[Arizona Republic Article: Summer of Fear](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-best-reads/2016/09/02/summer-fear-when-serial-shooter-and-baseline-killer-terrorized-phoenix/89557694/) \n\n[Phoenix New Times: Baseline Killer](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/take-a-chilling-look-inside-the-baseline-killer-case-6451168)",

Some 2 decades ago my mother had a streak of boyfriends (yeah yeah OP's mom is a ho', and yes she is) and this one basically turned out to be a paranoia and drug-fueled psycho and parasite. He was ok for a while, lived with us and couldnt hold a job except a few IT things here and there like fixing or installing PCs (thats about all he could do). A few years down the line, my mother realised it was time to cut loose ends and that he was useless dead weight so she slowly started trying to usher him out.\n\nI was already getting sick of him as well, but being around 15 or so, there wasnt much i could do or say to a 30 year old moron that was a head taller than me beyond \"fuck off\". Except one day i made the mistake of laughing at him and taunting him on one of his off hand comments. It started off with him playing comedy and \"falling unconcious\" in the corridor. I saw him lie there, and then just left (i've fainted before when i was younger due to a lack of vitamins, and when it happens you're not comfortably laying on the floor, you're a mess of arms and legs bent like Peter Griffin after falling down the stairs) to go back to play on my PC. I could hear him get up, shuffle off and walk up to me asking \"didnt you hear me faint?\" to which i simply answered \"I did, and i dont care\".\n\nSo thats when the record scratch comes and you're starting to wonder how i got here, well here's the rest. He started spewing threats and other weak shit to which i had the stupid nerve to say \"Yeah, try me.\" Well the issue was, he did. I was sitting at my computer, my back facing him and he simply walked up to me and threw me on the floor and tried to beat me (he was really weak by then, probably trying to look miserable on purpose as he wasnt eating anymore). When he got off, i locked myself in my room, called my mom and packed a bag then basically ran away and we had to hide in a hotel for a few nights. Two days later, when we came back when he wasnt there, i noticed that i was **also** missing one of my hunting knives (i used to collect knives when i was a teen) from my wall, so thats when we basically decided it was time to call the cops and force him out.\n\nTurns out, that same night we left, the asshole came back and barricaded himself in our appartment by locking the door on all locks and bolts and the police had to break the door down and physically drag him out of there. Never found the knife, he even had the balls to blame it on me trying to set him up. I honestly wish i did think of that...but he dug his own grave on this one.\n\nLater we found out he also stole money and some jewelry from us, and while sadly he wasnt extradited back to his country...the thing that worries me the most and im still shocked it happened was that my mother, the fucking warrior she is, **DROVE** that fucking piss stain back on her own.\n\nSo yeah, Danny if you ever happen to read this: I hope you fucking die a slow, painful, lonely death, you useless piece of psychopathic trash.

            "text": "I have mentioned this before on Reddit related to my ongoing issue, and this won't be as viscerally dangerous as some other stories but here goes:\n\nAfter reporting being sexually assaulted by a female student, I faced a lot of harassment for years.  One of the most extreme examples of this was a SWATing attempt.  For those that don't know, that's when someone calls the police on you for a high risk and extreme situation hoping the police will harm you by mistake.  It usually happens to live streamers.\n\nSo I am still in school at this point, and I had recently been told point blank that officials will do absolutely nothing about the situation, and that \"if you are attacked you better not defend yourself or you will be the one in trouble.  You aren't afraid of these kids are you, after all you are a man?\" from an employee I reported the constant barrage of harassment to. They had been lobbing constant false accusations against me for a bit too, so I had begun recording everything and taking a strict routine between classes and went off of it to the adjacent shopping center and sat at a bar every day for the express purpose of having witnesses to where I was at all times in case of bullshit.  Came in handy a ton and made a few friends with the staff.\n\n So I was pretty on edge all of the time.  One day I'm at said bar and I'm working on a paper when I get a flurry of emails and a phone call from the head of security on campus.  He knew my routine and he asked if I was on campus and where I was.  I told him the usual spot with the usual witnesses and two security cameras here to confirm, so he sighed and told me to walk back to campus ASAP, he needed to talk to me about a serious problem that happened.\n\nWhile the administration had it out for me for reporting their inaction to the Department of Education, which has since lead to several investigations that are still ongoing years later, the head of security was a cool guy who understood how fucked the situation was.  I get to his office and sits me down, explains that I'm safe now, but some of the harassing students had called me in like an active shooter.  The police had begun to respond, but against protocol the head of security double checked with me to see where I was and took a big risk in telling them that this is almost certainly a false alarm and had successfully sent them away after contacting me.  He asked to check my belongings, no gun or anything obviously, wrote an letter on official letterhead that I was not a threat to campus, gave a copy to me and sent it to everyone else, pissed at the harassing students.\n\nLater in chat logs of harassing students from a group chat where they organized some of the harassment, they were practically salivating over the idea that the police were about to gun me down on campus. They were trying to guess where it would happen and if they could get a good view of it somewhere to watch and record it. \n\nNone of them ever got in trouble.  After obtaining those chats from a student within the group who thought the whole situation was too fucked up, the Dean revealed to the students that someone was taking screenshots of the group and apparently told them based on the last messages in the chat that \"it wasn't a big deal\" and was more angry that they did something that could have ended up on the news, even going so far as to advise them on how to make me feel uncomfortable on campus more subtly because \"nobody wants him here anyway.\"  At most one student had to agree to a formal apology she didn't even write herself through official school memorandum and she wasn't even removed from the class we shared.\n\n\nI tried finishing on that campus for another year and a half.  It was ruining me psychologically, so I eventually medically withdrew due to all of this non-stop insanity and how completely unsafe I felt at all times.  After I withdrew, I was eventually expelled after the fact in a complete farce of a process that broke nearly every guiding rule and law around Title IX, expressly for reporting the sexual assault to the school and speaking out about my experiences, which has landed the school in even more hot water.  Emboldened, the students continued to follow me off campus, only stopping the physical harassment after I got a TPO against my attacker.  \n\nI still get crazy messages sometimes to this day.",

He'd do and say the occasional innapproriate thing that made me feel uneasy, but not bad enough to be rude or make him feel alone and we both liked horses, so that's pretty much what we talked about.   \n\n\nI thought he was fine with this and things went on as before.

He said in a condescending tone \"You don't really think we are going to rape you, do you?\" and I felt stupid and ashamed and said no but they kept going on and finally I said I was going to the washroom and please get the jokes out of your system while I'm gone or I'll leave.

Cops beat us there and begin talking with the woman, we (me and my partner) get there and start looking at her head. She says she takes medicine but unsure what type of medicine, so she told me to go to her bathroom to check her medicine cabinet for the pills she takes. When I get to the staircase to head upstairs immediately there's gun shots. Thankfully my ninja reflexes saved me, jk. I think the guy just fired random ass shots down the stairs near me. The cops did not hesitate to take him out, they didn't even fire a shot, after the gun shots at me there was no more shots, guy came out peacefully. This isn't exactly a murder attempt but he did fire shots at someone in hopes to harm them so it counts in my book",

It was the day before memorial day 2003. \n\nMy mother is deaf, and she removed her hearing device and refused to look at me. The pull out couch was open and I stood on it trying to get her to acknowledge me. Finally she got frustrated and shoved me down and tried to fold me up in the pull-out. I laughed in her face because it was absurd. She clicked over to rage and left the room. I allowed the pull-out to open back up, and then she came back. She had a large kitchen knife, held in stabbing position. Her lips were peeled back and she had this crazed look in her eyes. She went around to my left and was walking up the side of the bed when she tripped and dropped the knife. \n\nI rolled off the bed in the other direction and grabbed the first potential weapon I saw, a belt on the bed. I was backing away, trying to get to my bedroom and maybe a phone, while she had recovered and was approaching me with the knife again. I hit her with the belt several times until she dropped the knife, then ran, grabbed the phone plugged in the hallway, and barricaded myself in the bathroom. I tried to call a friend (mother had caused a healthy distrust of police from calling them over me refusing to do dishes, and I had recently spent a year in foster care and didn't care to do that again), but right as we connected, mother started pounding on the door and screaming and trying to force it open. Then she unplugged the phone. \n\nShe called my stepfather at work to tell him her version and I spoke to him as well. I don't remember this part as clearly. But then we took my laundry out of the car (we were supposed to be going to the laundromat) and she left to do laundry. I got on the internet and was able to let my friend that I called know I was okay. She had almost called the police. \n\nThen a police car pulled into the driveway and I got off the computer very quickly. My mother had gone to the ER for the welts I gave her and told them she threw a knife at me, so police were sent to make sure I was alive. I then gave them the full story,  they took the knife, and they took me. They got a very long report from me on what happened, and then I was taken to JIAC - Juvenile Intake and Assessment Center.

The reason I became a counselor is because I worked so hard on myself that I developed the skills to be able to help others. Mine included a fair bit of a brain injury and a lot of trauma and I don't have actually know exactly what happened. It's taken years go piece together the details but I'll do my best to share them. It's honestly been so long since I last wrote about it that it's probably overdue for my own recovery that I write it again. \n\nI grew up in a small, remote community. Everyone knew everyone, bullying was rampant. I got beat up pretty bad at 12 and my parents responded by sending me to live with my cousins in the city. I went from living in an isolated community of under 2000 to living in the core of a city of over a million. I was too naive to survive. \n\nMy cousins weren't around much, it was pretty free range in their apartment. A group of older kids in the neighborhood took an interest in me, I looked up to them so much at the time and loved how they all seemed to have each others' backs and even dressed pretty similiar (they all wore the same color). One of the older girls even took a romantic interest in me! Oh I was in heaven, I had no idea I was being recruited. \n\nThere was lots of talk for a couple months about joining their group and how excited they were and all that but after a couple months... it just stopped. No idea why. They stopped taking me to the two houses they'd take me and I stopped seeing a lot of then. I've never pieced by that was. It ended up being just 3 of us who kept hanging out after that \n\nC was the girl who showed romantic interest in me. In hindsight I realize that it wasn't genuine at first but I honestly feel like something grew. I was 12+13 in the 8 months we dates, I was head over heels. She was 3 years older and treated me like a kid brother, I dont think she ever saw me romantically but she definitely looked out for me and spent a lot of time teaching me common sense. A spent years chasing the ideals and goals she set for my life. \n\nJ was an interesting guy. He used a ton of names, everyone knew him by a different name. To this day I have no idea what his actual name was. J's family were quite involved in the gang/ drug life, his uncle owned a shady pizza place where we all would hang out. J was 4 years older than I was and I felt invincible around him. I was like a puppy dog behind him, I'd do whatever he did. To me he was the most interesting man alive and he taught me a lot of life skills of questionable legality. J had his struggles with substances when he was around the bigger group but he'd only smoke pot when hanging with me and C. \n\nThis next part I have no memory of. From what I understand, we were hanging out in the alley behind J's uncles. We got pulled up on by a group of 4-5 guys who were looking for J's brother (a substance user who would piss a lot of people off). They weren't sober and wanted J to come with them. Apparently when things escalated I threw the first punch and was hit in the head by something hard. They put a beating on J and he ended up a block away. They left his body under a dumpster, he died from two stab wouldn't. The story with C is more confusing. The story I got is that she agreed to go peacefully with them where they raped and killed her. My clothes from that day though had her blood on them, I think she shielded me from further injury, I think she saved me. \n\nI don't know who called the ambulance/ police or how I ended up in the hospital or even much of the next 6 months (or most of my teens at all). The head trauma really played a number on my ability to think clearly for a long time. One thing I do remember is waking up in the hospital surrounded by lights and having someone questioning me about C and me being desperate to know where she was but not bring able to put together who she was. \n\nSo yeah, unlike a lot of others posted here, I don't remember any details of mine (probably for the best tbh).",

            "text": "This is probably one of the only things I've ever had a story to tell for on here.\n\nI was maybe 3 or 4 years old, very young. I typically refer to this event as my first significant memories as a child. As when looking back, it's essentially the first thing that I can recall from my early childhood years.\n\nThere was this young Preteen/teenage kid who used to come around and hang out at my place and talk to my parents and \"play\" with me. He lived down the street to the left of my house, maybe 4/5 houses. I didn't see him very often but he would come around. Apparently he actually lived out of state but would come back over to where I lived every so often.\n\nWell, there was this day during the summer when my parents had set up a swimming pool in our back yard. One of the Blue ones with the puffy dark blue rims around the top of the edge of it. I was playing in the pool by myself at the time, because it wasn't all that deep, I could reach my feet to the floor if needed and hold myself above water but was really enjoying floating around.\n\nFrom a distance I could see the kid referenced before walking towards my house/me from down the street. He was cutting through yards and made a direct line towards where I was. He was pretty close after a minute or so and started yelling \"can I swim with you\" etc. My dad was always at work when I was this age and my mom was, not very reliable, she had drug problems, alcohol issues, a lot of other things I did not know about. So needless to say, she was not the most attentive.\n\nHe came up and got into the pool with me, and everything was fine for 30 minutes or so. My mom had apparently seen he was in the pool with me at some point by looking out at us through the patio window but didn't think anything of it and let us be.\n\nAfter that point, I don't have much recollection of the specifics of what happened. I remember him asking me to have a \"hold your breath\" contest to see who could hold our breath the longest. So I went once or twice, he went once or twice, and I finally went one more time, but on that last time he decided to hold me under. I felt his hand wrap around the back of my neck and hold me down under the water, as I started to panic and not know what to do, he was shoving his penis into my mouth. He was holding me under the water and drowning me while doing this. I don't remember much outside of this.. I have very detailed memories of the experience itself and then everything just being black. I remember this intense feeling of helplessness and fear and the physical sensations of him holding me down under the water and, well, doing what he did.\n\nI came to with my mom freaking out screaming and crying and my neighbor holding me over his knee on the ground. My understanding is that he was either a firefighter or an EMT of sorts, not sure exactly but I was told he probably saved my life that day. He had seen what was happening from next door. There was maybe 40/50 ft of distance between my house and that neighbors house. When he came over to help, I was already unconscious and as he was coming over the kid had ran off and left/ran away.\n\nHe was never held accountable for anything. After it happened, my parents went to talk to his parent/s or whatever they were, legal guardians, over at the house down the street from us, and they said he wasn't there and that he had gone back to whatever state he lived in. It ended up being a situation where it was nearly impossible for us to do anything legally for some reason. I don't know why.\n\nFlash forward, years later as I was entering 5th grade. The kid who had done all of that to me was maybe 14 or 16 and was in 8th grade, he hadn't been there the years prior and had shown up for the final year back from the other state he had stayed in. He walked through the hallway by the cafeteria one day and as soon as I saw him I had this visceral reaction that completely overwhelmed me with fear. I yelled out at him, and said something like \"YOU, YOURE THE ONE WHO TRIED TO KILL ME\" and of course everyone probably looked at me like I was crazy.. everyone around me and my friends at the time didn't know what I was talking about. He kept walking, (assuming he was on his way to a class) and looked back at me but he was grinning at me.\n\nA day or two later I had come across him again and directly confronted him and he denied all of it, he denied even knowing who I was and said he had just moved here from out of state to finish his last year of school. None of my other schoolmates knew who he was before this, and he got along really well with everyone at the school, the teachers and students and what not. So I was treated like a lunatic over the whole situation.. I basically just resigned myself to pretending it never happened and having to spend an entire year of school walking around in the same halls as him and seeing him constantly. He would always randomly look at me and smile/wave or single me out by coming up to me, knowing I would be intimidated and then talk to someone who was right besides me at the last second..\n\nMy time in school for that period was hell.. the whole experience was.\n\nSorry if this is somewhat disjointed, it gets really hard to talk/think about the more I dwell on it.  \n\n\nEdit: I know I said I was entering 5th grade, but I feel like that's not right as it doesn't line up very well with the age gap between us at the time of the event occurring, I know for a fact I was 3 or 4 years old. So when he had joined up at the school, I know for certain that he was in 8th grade, I don't know exactly what age he was, he may have been held over a year, not sure. I want to say that it was somewhere between me being in 3rd grade to 5th grade, I'm not entirely sure on the details of which grade it was I was in at the time. I also corrected because I misspoke on his age at the time, saying he was 17 or 18 in 8th grade, which obviously is not right because 8th graders are typically about 13/14. So that's the age he would have been around that time and I edited it to reflect that change.",

He decided to go on one of his tangents about u.s. grants and blah blah blah, I was done with hearing it and got up to leave, he jumped in front of me and said I wasn't going anywhere, I pushed him and said \"move\", I got around him and went inside, before I knew it he was strangling me.

His girlfriend woke up and tried to intervene, he threw her across the bed with his other hand, I passed out from not breathing and hit the floor. When I came to, he came after me again because I was not dead. I had super strength at this point and picked up a dog grooming table and flung it at him across the room screaming for help, my mom came out of her room and intervened. He denied everything and said that I went nuts for no reason. I called the police, had him arrested and pressed charges. He spent a year in jail. We haven't spoken since then (4 yrs ago).

It’s the ex and he’s breathing heavy and telling me he’s gonna kill me. I’m all “whatever man, quit calling me” he tried calling again but I ignored it. 3-4 minutes later there’s violent pounding on my apt. Door. Apparently the heavy breathing was due to him stalking towards my apt. From a distant parking lot. He is screaming about he’s gonna kill me,telling me to come out. Well my neighbor across the hall, a older lady came out of her place clutching a baseball bat. She says “get outta here or I’m calling the cops”” I’m watching this through my peep hole. Finally he turns and heads towards the front door of the building so I figured he was leaving. I run over to my floor level window in the living room to see him go and as I pull back the blinds I see him staring at me, inches from my face. He punches through the window at my face. Thankfully I have good reflexes and was able jump back to only get some glass embedded in my face. The guy rears back and jumps head first through the window he just broke with his fist. He’s wearing a cowboy heat and a full length duster as if he planned on getting in my apt no matter what (I’m not kidding) I’m wearing shorts and nothing else as I had been woken up by all of this. He lands on the floor in a crouched position and I ran and jumped on his back trying to get my arm around his neck. He stands with my full weight on his back and starts backing into the shelving and walls really hard trying to knock me off of him. Pans were bent it was so violent. Finally when he slammed me into the wall the last time his chin came up and I was able to sink my arm around his neck tight. I then threw my body down and backwards and pulled. I was choking him so hard that his legs starting twitching after 7-10 seconds. I knew this meant he was out but wasn’t sure if he was playing possum so I just choked harder the whole while  screaming “ HELP! CALL 911! HELP CALL 911!” At the top of my lungs intermittently saying to the guy “FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU” I then started thinking about not wanting to kill this guy. Even if that was his intent, I didn’t want that on my conscious. So i let him breathe. When he finally snapped to he started trying to attack me again flailing his hand backwards, a hand with a piece of glass in it. So I had to choke him out again, Still screaming for 911. This happened 3-4 times before the police arrived. Thankfully the neighbor across the hall described us well and explained the situation so when they came in they just yanked him off of me as I was still on my back with my arm around the guys neck. He woke up in handcuffs.  As it all calmed down the first arriving officer comes back to me and says “ are you aware he defecated in his pants during this fight?” I said No.  I’m told “the guy says you squeezed the shit out of him and that he was here because you are on drugs” I tell the officer that it’s ironic to have a guy that jumped head first through a window to say someone else is on drugs. Fast forward through the PPO’s and plea agreements and he was ultimately charged with 2nd degree home invasion and that was it.  He spent 3 years of a 5-10 in prison.. nice , huh?

I was waiting at the bus stop, it was only me and an older woman waiting there, I had received a phone call from my partner a few moments earlier about how there had been a stabbing and that I should stay safe, a few minutes after that call a man crossed the road, walked up to me and hit me over the head with a wooden fence post. I blacked out, not sure how long it was for but I came to, on the floor with blood spilling out from my head, it's foggy, I don't remember his face but I know I looked up, said, \"What the fuck\" over and over, I somehow managed to stand up and run, I don't think he expected me to get up and was put off guard.\n\n I know now that around 30 minutes before hitting me this man had stabbed and killed a 24 year old man, I often think about how if I hadn't woken up in that moment I most likely would have been killed, this guy had done it before, he had the capacity to. I ran across the road, almost getting hit by a car and made it to a pharmacy where she amazing staff took care of me while we waited for an ambulance, I apologized many times for getting so much blood on their floor, I remember finding my wallet and phone in my pockets, realizing that this guy did what he did solely to hurt me made me break into tears. I made it to hospital, gave a 12 page statement to the police, they took my clothes as evidence, my favorite Balor Club shirt which was covered in my blood, I'm still mad I wore it that day.

            "text": "My older sister was incredibly abusive towards my family, but especially me (I’m away now, so no worries). When I was fourteen, our dad and her were having a super petty argument that just exploded into her trying to kill him while he tried to defend himself without hurting her.\n\nShe tried to stab him three times over but thankfully failed as my dad disarmed her. I could only watch this whole thing happen, completely frozen.\n\nShe then turned to me and let out a horrible scream that I will always remember. She grabbed a knife off the floor and lunged at me, knocking me to the ground. She swung the knife towards my eye while screaming something along the lines of “I’m taking your eye”. She kept pushing the knife towards it, but I managed to put my hands over hers and pull it off, my dad also tried to pull her off but when she got like this, she had this insane primal strength and could barely be moved. The knife then cut underneath my eye, nearly hitting the eyeball. \n\nAs usual with these events, nothing came of this and my mum and sister still gaslight me and say that I had some glandular issue and that’s how I got a scar.\n\n\n\nEDIT - Wow, I had no idea this would get as popular as it has. Thanks to those who are offering their support and sharing their experiences, it’s a very difficult thing to do.  \n\nA lot of questions and statements on here, some are ones I’ve heard all my life, others not so much. All of them are hard to answer.\n\nQuestion: ‘What’s the deal with your mum?’\n\nI love both of my parents very much and we still have a good relationship, however, the way they dealt with and still deal with my sister was at best, awful. When I say that I was abused by my sister my whole life, I’m talking as far back as when we were babies (we’re only two years apart). Whenever my sister would get violent or aggressive, sometimes my mum would step in and defend me. \n\nShe knows my sister’s behaviour isn’t normal, but she’s terrified of her and what she might do. My mum’s behaviour can be a little weird around it, but as I’ve gotten older, I’ve come to understand why she acts this way. \n\nAt times, my mum will downplay stuff and will mention how her older brother did similar stuff to her growing up. To her, this is normal. However, sometimes when I get flashes from my PTSD, she comforts me and confirms that what I went through was hellish, even going as far as saying she’s a terrible mother for not stepping in when she needed to. \n\nAlso, my mum wasn’t present during the actual stabbing, she was only there for the aftermath and my sister fed her a bunch of lies. For example, I once caught my sister punching herself in the legs so she would bruise up and make it look like my dad had hit her, when he didn’t.\n\nQuestion: ‘What about your dad?’\n\nI love my dad but he’s a deeply flawed man. He grew up very poor without education and has a very old fashioned way of looking at work and masculinity. My whole life he would joke around and say things along the lines of he didn’t think I was a real man because I was less ‘manly’ than other guys. A few comments state that my mum and sister are similar, however, this is the opposite.\n\nIn fact, my dad and sister are incredibly similar. My dad has never been physically abusive like my sister, but his behaviour is often erratic and overly explosive. My dad has had a long line of mental illness run in his family ( a fact I only found out a year ago), so it’s incredibly likely my sister has inherited it from him. She either used to bully me or bully my dad, because she has a control complex and wanted everyone to let her do whatever she wants.\n\nQuestion: ‘Where were the police?’\n\nThis is a question I get asked so much. As to why my parents never contacted the police, I have no idea.\n\nI think there’s a selfishness from my parents, for sure, and I think they’re aware of this. Nobody wants their kid to be ‘the crazy one who got arrested’. It seems like a stupid thing to state, but presumably once you’re a parent, your attitude changes.\n\nIt even took some convincing for my mum to let me go to therapy because she was sure I didn’t need it.\n\nAlso, the police aren’t equipped to deal with ‘domestic disputes’ like this. They just don’t give a shit. At best, nothing will be done and my sister would’ve had even more reasons to be angry. \n\nNearly every authority figure I tried to tell through my life has teased me about it. Once when I was 11, I tried to tell a school counsellor about the abuse while crying my eyes out. He told me that I was lying, that I was a “good actor” and that the fact I’m getting bullied “by a girl” shows how much growing up I have to do and that I should just ‘punch her’. Awful guy.\n\nJust after the stabbing, my mum came home and called my sister and said that if she didn’t come home (she had ran off) she would call the police. She promptly came home. \n\nQuestion: ‘Why didn’t you just fight back?’\n\nThis abuse was going on my whole life. It took 4 years of therapy and a therapist telling me at 20 years old, “you were abused”, to make me realise what a cruel joke my life was.\n\nFighting back only made it worse. You raise your voice a little? Get smacked. You tell her to stop? That’s another smack. You get aggressive? All your stuff gets broken, and a smack.\n\nThere have been few times where I’ve had to physically fight back because if I didn’t, I would’ve been killed by her. If I ever beat her in a fight, nothing would happen. Just the same shit the next day.\n\nAbuse was my life. It still is. If nobody is hurting me, then I have to hurt myself. It’s the way my brain will work for the rest of my life. I’m actively trying to get better, and I am healing, although very slowly.\n\nQuestion: ‘Why didn’t you get the hell out?’\n\nWhere was I going? I had nowhere to go, I was a child/teen.\n\nI left the city for another when I was 21 to pursue university, that’s when I knew I could feasibly get out and never talk to her again. I blocked her number the moment I moved in.\n\nI still haven’t spoken to her since June of 2019. She talks about me to my parents every time she sees them, faking sadness and saying how much she wants to see me. My parents refuse to tell her where I lived and I currently live with my partner where I’m much happier, she also knows of my abuse and supports me. \n\nHowever, I soon have to go back to see my grandma. I have been making an active effort not to run into my sister, but it’s inevitable. I’ll try and work it out.",

Also, before he married my cousin, he had another family who all died in a house fire.  All four of his children and his previous wife.  We all felt bad for him for suffering such a tragic loss, because we didn't know what he was like behind the scenes at home.  We never suspected anything off about that, just thought it was a tradedy.  Well, finally my cousin decided to leave him.  She took her two kids and moved away.  She had to leave abruptly, so she was missing a lot of important things.  Social security cards, birth certificates.  Stuff like that.  One day, after things cooled down some between her and her ex, she arranged for her to go over to their old house and gather the rest of their things.  He asked that she bring the kids, because he \"missed\" them.  Luckily, she decided to let them stay at their friend's house instead.  She went over to the house, and he was absolutely enraged that she didn't bring the kids.  He shot my cousin four times and then shot himself in the head.  He was planning to do a murder suicide with the whole family, that's why he wanted the kids there.  My cousin was shot twice in the neck, in the face, and in the arm.  Somehow, none of the bullets struck any major arteries or anything.  She was able to make it next door to her neighbor's house and get help.  She survived a murder suicide attempt, and her ex didn't.  That whole thing really makes me look at that house fire tragedy in a different light.",

The sounds from our struggle caught his attention and after seeing what was happening, he pushed the attacker off me and knocked him to the ground. He then woke the other roommate and together they restrained the attacker on his bed and called the university police. The police arrived around 15 minutes later and after we told them what happened, they called the actual cops. My roomamate was arrested and taken to the police station, there he had another breakdown and bit one of the cops. He was transferred to a psychiatric facility after that.

            "text": "Last year my neighbor plotted to kidnap and murder my wife and I.\n\nI was working from home one morning and heard a knock at the door at 8AM. I ignored it at first hoping whoever it was would go away. After a minute of knocking I opened the door. It was my neighbor who I had spoken with a few times. \n\nMy wife was at work and I could tell he was surprised when I opened the door and not my wife. He was expecting her to be home and not me. He noticed that I recently purchased a new car and asked if I could show it to him. He tried to walk inside but I asked him to walk around to the garage because of covid-19.\n\nI showed him the car and he was acting strange. Always kept one hand in his pocket. My garage is very small so we were in close proximity to each other. He kept inching closer to me which made me uncomfortable. He brought a opened coke bottle, filled with a tan liquid, and said \"I brought you a coke\". I declined the offer.\n\nAfter a few minutes he asked if he could see my gauge cluster. We walked around to the drivers side and I sat in the driver seat to turn on the car and show him the gauge cluster. With door open, there was very little room besides the side of the car and the garage wall.\n\nAfter turning on the car he pulled a large hunting knife to my neck. I immediately grabbed his wrist and slammed him back into the wall. At this point we are wrestling between the car and wall as I try to get the knife away from him. During this 30 second period, it seems like a absolute miracle that I was not stabbed. The blade grazed past my stomach multiple times.\n\nI was eventually able to grab the knife and force him out into the driveway. Immediately after grabbing the knife he started saying \"what are you doing!? I was just trying to show you my knife??\" and acting like I had just assaulted him. I was in such a state of shock that I actually started to believe him and wondered if I had overreacted. I know this seems ridiculous but I was completely delusional at the time and did not know what his intentions were.\n\nI stood in the driveway, hands shaking, with 911 dialed on my phone but did not make the call. He acted like nothing just happened and start asking my questions. Really suspicious questions. \"do you have a security system?\"... I lied and said yes. \n\nI asked him to go home multiple times and eventually went back inside the house but did not shut the main garage door. At this point I needed to drive into work and started getting ready. Showering, getting dressed, ect.. I assumed he had just walked back home.\n\nAfter getting ready I went outside and walked around the house to the garage with a can of bear mace. I searched around the garage and was worried he was still there. As I started to get into my car and leave, I saw my neighbor laying down behind some boxes in the garage... staring at me. I yelled and ran as fast I could back to the front door and called the cops.\n\nCops arrived quickly and my neighbor had disappeared. They searched around his house and mine but could not find him. They said they would stay in the area but were going to leave for now.\n\nMy house is surrounded by woods and I have a large back porch. Frightened, I stood in the middle of the porch while holding bear mace. I looked around and noticed my neighbor hiding in the woods staring at me. I ran back inside and called the cops.\n\nCops arrived quickly and pulled guns on my neighbor and arrested him. He later said \"I was just trying to scare him\". They found the knife, zip ties, vodka, and a note on him that read \"turn around and put your hands behind your back.\"\n\nIt was later discovered that the coke bottle he wanted me to drink contained pesticides. He was there to murder me or my wife.\n\nHe was charged with 3 felony counts and is currently awaiting trial.",

He came to my house the next day, as agreed, and picked up my car. At that time I gave him 100 dollars for a specific part he said he needed to fix it. Later that day, he returned to my house with my vehicle and another man. The car had not been fixed and he said he needed another 200 dollars for parts. Both men were clearly on drugs. I told him I didn’t have the money and that I would just drive him home and I would have him fix it in the next couple weeks when I had saved the money. While driving them home, the man who I didn’t know pulled out a gun and held it to the back of head and told me drive to a secluded location. On the way out to this location my gas light came on. He instructed me to pull into a gas station. When we pulled we exited the vehicle and walked up to an ATM just outside of the gas station. He held his gun against my side as we walked up to the ATM. I reached into my back pocket, pulled out my wallet and threw it toward the door of the gas station. I have no idea why I did this, I just knew I had to do something to throw him off. He immediately cursed at me and went toward my wallet and I took off running and went behind the gas station, and kept running toward a field. I never turned around until I got to a tree line where I could see the gas station behind me about 100 yards. I had no wallet, no cell phone, and I could see my vehicle going very slowly up the road in the direction I was hiding. With the driver side window down, this man was now driving my car. He reached his gun out the window and fired 6 shots towards me. He then sped off down the road. I continued to stay where I was until 3 police vehicles, with sirens going, arrived at the gas station. I then started walking back to the gas station and towards the police with my hands up. I was never so happy to be placed in handcuffs.",

Over the summer he had sublet to a local townie guy that turned out to be a nightmare and he was telling us about it (among MANY other things the guys had stolen all of the roommates' credit cards and IDs- strange since they were of different racial ethnicities so the IDs wouldn't help). \nAs he described the guy, we all realized that he was the \"crazy\" man we dealt with while walking over-there had been a dude saying real violent and crass things while walking next to us, uncomfortably close).\nAbout an hour into hanging out, there was a VERY LOUD POUNDING on the door!!! And crazy guy starts yelling \"Let me the fuck in, now! I know it was you!\"\nApparently, our buddy had (appropriately) called the police on the stolen cards and ID. Guy was yelling \"let me in, Im gonna KILL you!\" and pounding on the door so hard the deadbolt was starting to crack in the door frame.\nWe were juniors in college and my gf (wife now!) and her friends were freshmen and getting nervous- he had been saying things about \"rape\" when we were all walking in.\nSo we call the police but it was a weekend night in a college town and they told us it could take up to an hour for them to show up. The guy had been pounding and threatening for 10+ minutes and didn't sound like he was gonna stop- he clearly knew the doorframe was cracking too. So we push the ALL THE FURNITURE up against the door. Felt like we were in a movie- would have been funny if it hadnt been ridiculously terrifying. We were on 2nd floor of a building and the girls and one of our buddy were legit trying to build a rope ladder out of sheets to go out a back window.\n\nAll of the sudden the knocking and yelling stops. And its quiet for like 3 minutes. Then, from upstairs where a college party had been going on, we hear yelling and banging around and then a bunch of dudes getting really loud. Then there was the clear sound of someone falling down stairs and a building shaking BOMP! (Apparently- we found out later- crazy guy had gone upstairs to an open door party and started groping girls. It took 3 big dudes to push him out the door and he fell down the stairs and the BOMP was him hitting the drywall at stairs end.)\nGuy left the building after that. Cops show up 5 minutes later - apparently upstairs called cops too (to realize how dangerous this guy seemed, college kids were calling cops TO COME to parties). We had to unstack furniture to speak with the police and they knew EXACTLY who we were talking about as soon as we explained what was going on. \nUnfortunately- they didn't find him that night. He left there, stole our buddy's car, stalked, kidnapped, raped, murdered and burned the body of a 19yr old student that night. He wasn't exaggerating when he was yelling he would kill us or saying he wanted to rape the girls. \nThey caught him because he continued trying to use our buddy's credit cards.\n\nWe found out that IN PRISON he RAPED AND MURDERED a female correctional officer who was transferring him out of solitary confinement.\n\nDude was a killer and had us cornered... I am glad that we stacked that furniture. It creeps me out to think about how close it came to a face to face confrontation with a literal crazed killer.",

My dad had only been back around for a few months after being homeless for a while due to his 20+ year meth addiction. He had never been violent towards me before, but I later found out he had tried to kill my mother just months prior and she brushed it off as him having a PTSD episode.\n\nI came home from school, he surprise attacked me by suffocating me with a pillow/strangling and attempted to sexually assault me. I had just gotten a boyfriend and wasn’t around as often and by the language he used when trying to assault me, it was clear this was the source of his anger. He had the TV turned up to an extreme volume so no one could hear me scream.\n\nI ended up being able to get up and run to the bathroom- the only room in our house with a lock. He grabbed the door but I found a sharp object in the bathroom and told him to back up or I’d kill him. I somehow was able to shove the door shut and lock it. He tried to get in the bathroom but couldn’t.\n\nHe actually said “I’m leaving!” and open/closed the front door to try and lure me out. It was quiet for a while but then I heard him breathing outside the door. He eventually left after a few hours, taking my money I had hidden in my bedroom, and called a relative telling them I’d been in a terrible accident and he needed a ride to the hospital. He ended up running when dropped off and was missing for a year. Most terrifying year of my life.\n\nHis body was found by a fisherman at his favorite lake growing up. They found high levels of meth in his system and it appeared to be a suicide.\n\nLater, when investigating the home I was attacked in, they found hammers/duct tape/knives under my mom’s mattress and looked like he very much so intended to kill me.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the kind words. Certainly the craziest life experience I ever hope to have and therapy was a long journey. The craziest part of it all was that my dad from childhood was still there simultaneously with the horrid attacker. He cried outside the door for a while telling me he was so sorry and I wouldn’t ever see him again, but would switch to trying to lure me out and being aggressive. There were many moments I could hear the duality of who he was. The murderous cracked out crazy person and someone who was regretful and really sad inside. Idk- just thought that was an interesting thing to add for context. It’s not always just so cut and dry between a crazy/bad person and a good/normal person I’ve learned.",

His mental disorders (that I'm now aware of) included anger issues, bi-polar disorder, PTSD, and paranoia. He would tell me all the time that he hated me because I looked like, and reminded him of my mother who divorced him after he hit her. His abuse continued for years because he told me if I told her about it, he'd kill me and her, and my mom was unaware because he only ever hit her once, so I don't think she realized he'd abuse his own child. One day, he was especially bad, I remember I had multiple fractured ribs, a fractured collar bone, and several bruises/cuts. By this point, I was already into horror movies (thankfully) and all I could think of, because of that, was \"get a knife\" because the \"damsel in distress\" always goes for a knife. I managed to get some distance between us by running inside, I went straight to the kitchen, and grabbed a knife off the counter, then got down on my knees and elbows to use my body to hide it (it was a big butcher knife) I heard him stop behind me, and when I saw him lean forward, I turned and lashed out at him, leaving a sizeable gash across his face. It didn't kill him, but he died when I was 13 due to a heart attack, that was the last time I saw him, other than when I saw him in court, for my mom to get full custody. She asked me during the hearing about the gash, all I said was \"I cut him.\" But I think she put the pieces together because she never pressured about why.",

I went down the same streets and alleys I always did, cutting through the center of the city to the edge of the moat by RAM Hospital.  \n\nI passed by the technical college and saw a group of guys hanging on the corner, I didn't think anything of it as I entered the final alley that would put me at the moat and my apartment.  Two mopeds passed me and went into a alcove to my right, and as I passed it they zoomed out and cut me off.  4 guys hopped off their bikes and one approached and said, \"where you going?\" and decked me in the face.  \n\nAs I think, \"did this motherfucker really just punch me in the face?\" I look up and he has his arm up and holding something, in a swinging motion, and I did the only thing I could, put my arms up to protect my face, and yell out.  After several blows to my arm, I attempted to turn and run, but his buddies were there to stop me and kept cutting off my escape. After a couple minutes, could've been less it's all a bit of a mess of memory, they all hopped on their bikes and dipped, I have no clue why maybe it was my yelling, and I looked down at my arm.\n\nMy left arm, below the wrist, was cut halfway through, one of my bones completely exposed, marrow and everything, my hand hanging uselessly at the end, and I immediately knew I was in deep shit even though I didn't feel a thing.  I have minor medical training so I  took note that no arteries were severed, but I was bleeding profusely and needed help.  I went to the guesthouse nearby and asked the attendant for help, poor thing looked faint when she saw me lol.\n\nShe got me in her car and took me to RAM Hospital literally 100 yards away.  Turns out what they guy swung at me was a machete according to the doctor, I thought it was a cane or rod of some sort.  So that's my story.  It's important for me to say I stayed in Thailand for a year after this event, despite friends pleas for me to gtfo and come home.  I wasn't about to let that shit ruin a lifetime opportunity for me.  \n\nAnyway I have full function of the arm and hand now, and after 4 years of drinking to bury the memory, I'm happy to say I started therapy 6 months ago, I quit drinking entirely, was diagnosed with PTSD, and am finally addressing the demon who's been hiding in the depths of my mind, and that motherfucker has his days numbered.\n\nThanks for reading my story, it's one I just recently had the courage to tell in full, rather than passing it off as \"shit happens\".  Peace and love, redditors.\n\nEdit: cleaned up the wording.\n\nEdit 2: cleaned up paragraphs, too",

I swam fight or flight to get to the ladder on the side of the deep end and right as I was at the point that I couldn’t take being shoved under the water another time, I grasped the ladder and screamed “STOP!” - my stepbrother didn’t help, and I think was intimidated by this kid. The neighbor kid was laughing, and as I ran inside to tell my mom, he grabbed my stepbrother and threatened to kill him. \n\nI rushed in to tell my mom before anything happened to him, who ran outside, to find that they were by that time splashing each other and playing. My older bio brother had come out too about ready to fight the kid, and eventually he ended up beating the kid up a couple weeks later for what he did. My mom didn’t call the police, but made a complaint to management at the apt complex. Stepbrother claimed they were just playing around with me.\n\nI think the kid got arrested a year later for trying to rob the nearby Wendy’s.

He was pretty douchey and immature and you could tell he was he was definitely they kind of guy who wouldn’t have a problem starting shit at a bar. \n\nWell one of the nights we ended up at a particular bar that in retrospect was not in a great part of town (none of us were familiar with the area so we had no idea at the time). It was getting late - probably around 3:30am if I had to guess. I found myself on the patio with Jim and another guy in the group we’ll call Steve. \n\nAfter quite a few pitchers the three of us were sitting outside shooting the shit and realized the rest of the group left for the strip club. Steve and I were in a conversation and weren’t really paying attention to Jim when we heard a commotion a few tables over. Apparently Jim had made a comment to a group of older rough looking bikers that they didn’t appreciate and things turned south quickly. Tension was getting high and Jim and one of the bikers were mouthing off when all of the sudden the biker guy pulls out a large 6” hunting knife and points it at Jim. \n\nSteve - who is ex military - immediately went on the defensive and grabbed the knife by the blade, slammed it on the table, and stared the biker in the face. He turned to me and told me to get Jim the hell out of here. I took Jim inside - who was drunk and completely oblivious to the severity of the situation  - and told him to sit the fuck down at the bar and wait. I ran back to the patio and saw Steve and the biker still in a stare down. This badass motherfucker apologizes for our drunk friend, told him we’re from out of town and that he needs to put the knife away - that we’re leaving and he’ll never see us again. They biker guy struggled to get the knife away when Steve said “put the fucking knife away before you make a mistake and it ends up in your neck.”\n\nThe biker finally submitted and put the knife back in the sheath. We collected Jim, called an Uber, and waited in the parking lot for our ride. I honestly thought Steve was going to kill Jim himself after the ordeal settled down as he was still running his mouth and was completely oblivious to what just went down. \n\nNeedless to say Steve was a fucking legend the rest of the weekend.

I caught COVID in a bad way the weekend before I was scheduled to get my first vaccine shot.  Was laid out on couch for a week, losing strength and will.  Eventually, I got so weak and light headed that I called 911 and had an ambulance drive me to hospital.  Was admitted with ~50% O2 level.  EMTs had to force me to talk to keep me conscious.  Spent ~ 3 weeks weeks on a high flow canula on max settings.  First week there was a doctor who came in at 930am every morning to tell me if I got worse he would stick me on a ventilator.  Hospital asked me to sign papers about what to do about with my organs if they couldnt get me back and I ended up a vegetable.  When I got out of the hospital and began the process of recovery, she acted incredibly on edge and different.  After a heart to heart about what was driving her crazy she told me she left me to die on the couch, because she figured I would handle it on my own.  Her excuse for not doing anything to help was that she recently switched nursing jobs because she got burned out for caring for people.  After seeing me like that, it flipped her shit when she realized what she had done.  I forgave her, because I could empathize with the stress and burn out.  I mean I can understand burn out, and because nursing involves people lives, I can see how this scenario ends up.\n\nA few months later in an unrelated  conversation she mentioned that she kept me around because she didnt know how to pay for the mortgage, and the other things that I pay for our family.\n\nI cant help but feel now that its more money related and less burn out, but that isnt something you can talk to someone about and get a real answer.\n\nShe now wonders why I dont get intimate with her anymore and will never again. \n\nKeeping the family together for now primarily because I want my son to think he has a strong family, until he gets to college.

So my dad decided to drop me off at this older woman’s house, (who was some family friend I had never known), and left to see if he could switch the lights back on for a couple days because it was the holidays, and he wanted to be able to get me a Christmas tree with lights on. Anyway, it’s me, my cousin, who’s like two years a older than me, (I’d say I was 7, him 9) and this older neighborhood kid I had never known. He hopped the fence into the family backyard, and instantly began fucking with me. I seriously don’t know why. My cousin acted like he was cool with the neighborhood kid, but in reality there was no control over the situation, especially because the actual adult was like, and ancient 90 year old woman who likely didn’t even know a full grown teenager was in her back yard.\n\nAnyway, that jackass put me in what I now know was a brutal air choke, where it felt like he was trying to collapse my windpipe, and I was too small to fight him off, and too timid to really do anything about it. I black out, and he dropped me on the ground. I regained consciousness, woke up, and he put in the same choke, and then I shit you not produced a chrome snub nosed revolver and stuck it in my face. I could see there were rounds in the cylinder, so I was in real danger then. He seriously whipped my ass, and nobody helped me. \n\nThinking back on it, maybe it wasn’t attempt murder, and maybe just a random torture, but legally, I think it could’ve fit the bill. Haven’t even thought about that one in years. I ended up becoming super aggressive once I learned some martial arts, and during my younger years, I was probably more like him than I would’ve wanted to be.\n\n\n\nI also got randomly shot at in that city, but that wasn’t directed at me, because I wasn’t into it with gangsters like that.

Fast forward a few months to Halloween. I am at a party hosted by my friend, who was also friends with my ex's younger brother (EYB, who was our age). I didn't think anything of it, because we had all been at school together for MONTHS since the breakup and I was fully over everything. EYB is getting dropped off at the party by ex, who also decided it would be funny to egg us. It started, turned into a huge messy game with all the party goers. Led me to 'hiding' in the garage bathroom with a can of shaving creme I found. I was hiding in the walk in shower, waiting for someone to come in so I could blast them. It was dark, but I heard his lighter. It was one of those flip open butane lighters, the click of it opening, the sound of it lighting, then he was pulling back the shower curtain and I promptly blasted him with the shaving cream. He grabbed me by the hair, pulled me into him and wrapped his hands around my throat. I struggled against him, punching and clawing. He turned me around so that my back was against his front, one hand still around my throat, the other turned on the light and I was looking at us in the mirror. His eyes. He looked so crazed. Like he had nothing but pure hatred for me and he was going to kill me. I struggled more and managed to scream for help. The hostess of the party (another girl my age) came bursting in, launched at him, somehow got some super strength and broke his grip from me and rushed me inside her house, locked all the doors, and shoved me into her shower to calm down and clean up. I apparently never let go of the shaving cream can and had been spraying it all over. I was covered in shaving cream, couldn't breath from hyperventilating. All the while, he is trying to break in the house to get to me. The others, even his brother, told him to leave or the cops were coming. He left, after doing donuts in the lawn, and we never called the cops. \n\nI don't think he intended to come out to murder me. Not even sure why he snapped like that.",

But this one night was more overt than the others.\n\nWhen I was about 6 or 7, my mom drove to the graveyard of Jimi Hendrix with me in tow. It was late at night and the streets were empty. She was a fan of Jimi, and even tried to convince me that he was my REAL father. I'm not black.\n\nShe told me that in an emergency it was okay to leap from the moving car. If I tucked when I rolled I'd be okay. She kept emphasizing this. On the drive to the graveyard she tried to convince me with the threat of beating the shit out of me that I needed to leap from the speeding car right then for practice. I couldn't do it, and earned several bruises as she savagely beat me while driving.\n\nWhen we got to the graveyard she did doughnuts all over the place, desecrating the grave sites of many deceased people. \n\nShe then pulled out a big ass revolver pistol. Think Dirty Harry sized. It was massive in my mom's hands. She began blasting away into the air- at least I think it was the air. Hope it was the air. I counted 5 shots, a pause, and a sixth. The last shot came very close to me. I still wonder if she debated putting that bullet into me.\n\nThen we high speed fled out of there. There was a straight away in the graveyard, and she was pushing the car as hard and as fast as it would go. I remember seeing the dial pass 70 before I lost sight of it in the dash. We were flying so fast towards a wall at the end of the straight away. I did that thing where you try to move backwards, but impeded by my own seat, I couldn't go anywhere. My mom just shouted for me to jump- and I froze. I couldn't leap from the car, even though I knew what was coming was certain death.\n\nShe slammed the breaks, and we stopped short of hitting the wall. She then pulled out of the graveyard and we left. I don't have a memory of anything after that point, but it would have been on brand for her to give me another savage beating after that. \n\nThis is the tip of the iceberg. She wanted me dead, but she didn't want to take the fall. In the years that followed my dad took custody of me (she tried using me as a shop ligting mule, got caught by police, and the loaded handcannon lost her custody of me to him). He would tell me that my mom was genius level IQ. And when I think back to all the \"attempts\" it was always her trying to trick me into doing it myself. She seldom struck me in the face so that clothes would hide the bruises. She was setting me up to die so she could walk away free without anyone asking any questions.",

This happened several times before and everytime she would just block the door, grab him and hold on so that he couldn't leave without using force to get away.

This time he tried to force her away from the door so he could finally escape the nightmare. When she realized that he would not be intimidated this time, and that he was in fact leaving for good she completely lost it. She was huuuugely dependent on my buddy because she wasnt working, didn't have her own place (yes he had to escape from his own home), so she couldn't let this happen. So she just drew a pocket knife and stabbed him in the side of the neck. Luckily her aim was off and the tip of the blade got stuck on the lower end of his skull. Just one centimeter down from where she struck and he would have died then and there.  After that he gave her a big adrenaline fueled push and booked it out of there.\n\nAfter that, she left on her own while making sure to partially destroy or at least scratch all of his homemade furniture (hes a carpenter) that he was very proud of. My friend was so shocked and traumatized that he didn't press charges of any kind because he just wanted it to stop. He didn't want to deal with her ever again even if it were from different sides of a courtroom. He was just completely done. When things slowly got back to normal it was too late for him to poof that what actually happend. The scar behind his ear just proves that someone tried to stab him, not who did it or why.

            "text": "I’ve had a few…\n\nI used to be a stripper and that job comes with risks simply based on you being placed in private situations with complete strangers with little to no security supervision (varies from club to club). I didn’t do “extras” and never promised I would, but some men can’t let go of their expectations and can get angry.\n\nThe first club I worked at, during a private dance very strong and large guy put me in a violent choke hold with his arm while trying to (also violently) fist me. I tried screaming for help (he just laughed and said that no one would care about another dead hooker) but the guy watching VIP that day was the resident low-functioning junkie on staff so he wasn’t walking around keeping an eye on us like he was supposed to AND he was nodding off at the desk so he wouldn’t have heard me over the already loud music. The customer did this for about 8 or so songs until I stopped struggling, which I guess (luckily) turned him off and he just threw the cash at me and walked out while I was gasping for breath on the seat. I couldn’t turn my head without excruciating pain for a while after.\n\nThat club was a former hangout of Aileen Wuornos, so almost dying there would have been darkly fitting.\n\nThe next time this happened was in a tiny club in another city in the lap dance area (just a room with short cubicles with benches… no actual vip rooms there). During the dance the guy starts telling me about his rape and murder fantasies and that he was happy to find the right girl to fulfill his needs. I start try to leave the dance when he grabs me by the throat, flips me over where my back is on the bench and my legs are in the air, then wraps his hands around my neck and starts to choke me with this dead look in his eyes. The guy thought that no one was watching because the security guy’s chair was empty and we were the only people in the whole area, but thankfully we our security guy was was just in the bathroom and immediately ran over and threw the guy off of me when he came out and only saw legs in the air with the guy bending over me.\n\nThe worst event happened when I had just confirmed I was pregnant with my son, which was an extra huge deal for me as I was told that having kids was going to be unlikely for me. This was in the fall before COVID happened during day shift at a club on Bourbon Street. My neighbor drove me in after that day’s shift manager called me in a panic after his bartender bailed AND he had no dancers, so I reluctantly came in to do both things. Neighbor stayed for a while (club was empty) and chatted over a few beers that were on me as thanks for the ride. Soon after a couple come in and order a beer each and start talking to the neighbor at the bar because they were all about the same age (late 50s/early 60s) and loved guns like good ol’ southern men 🙄and HAD to talk about their guns and gun things and their rough-and-tumble, self-proclaimed badassery. They all disappear to the back patio and I think nothing of it until I hear shouting maybe ten minutes later. My neighbor decided to claim that he was security there (he was not in ANY way… first time even in the building) when the customer (I’ll call him Texas because he was from Texas and wouldn’t shut up about Texas anytime he spoke to me) decides to pull out his gun to show off. Unbeknownst to me, my neighbor ALSO had his gun on him, starts insulting the guy and then hits on his fucking WIFE while attempting (unsuccessfully) to take this guy’s firearm.\n\nSo neighbor and Texas are screaming at each other and start physically fighting while making their way back inside, both guns are out by the time they are in front of me and I just go NOPE and duck under the bar until their scuffle takes them far enough away from the bar where I could run and hide somewhere.\n\nAside from me, my boss and DJ are inside and I have NO idea where they are or wtf they are doing. Door guy is outside oblivious to everything going on inside. I’m hiding in the dressing room behind a damn trash can terrified that I’m going to get shot and I’ll lose the baby because there was nowhere to really safely hide bc every place was easily accessible.\n\nWhile I’m hiding (poorly hidden I might add), all I hear is Texas yelling that he was “looking for that stripper bitch” and that I had nowhere to hide from him. An undetermined amount of time passes and my boss comes in all, “oh, there you are, xenowife! I need you back at the bar.”\n\nI’m shaking, confused as hell. Apparently after stomping around trying to find me Texas’s wife finally convinced him to stop the insanity and leave. It takes a bit longer to make my neighbor get the fuck out, but they finally kick him out and he’s outside as well. Business (the little smidge of business anyway) just goes on like nothing happened.\n\nI have more but my toddler is up now and wants mama time. \n\n**NOTE!!!** *I do NOT want my stories narrated on any of your YouTube channels or any other platform, so please don’t ask.*",

He and I grew very close, then he confessed having feelings for me but we talked it out and mutually decided to make some changes in our friendship to prevent lines being crossed. He and his girlfriend helped me get ready for a date one night, but when I returned home after the date he instantly took his girlfriend home, and just moments later she is calling me crying and asking if he was there with me. Before I could understand what she was saying he bursts through the front door and sees me on the phone. He assumed I was speaking to my date and in a jealous rage he snatched my phone from me while screaming \"If you dont want to fuck me, fine, but you're not going to fuck another n***a while I'm living here!\" I told him that was actually his girlfriend on the phone, at this time his phone started blowing up and he asked incredulously \"you told my girlfriend I've been trying to fuck you?!\" I responded \"no, YOU told your girlfriend you've been trying to fuck me.\" He beat me, broke bones, held me captive for 2 days attacking me over and over. \n\nThat should have been the end of it, but my dumbass was conditioned to accept abuse. From early childhood on I had always been in abusive situations, my husband who had only died a year and a half before this was incredibly abusive as well. So, as stupid as it is, after a few weeks I resumed my friendship with him, but things were not the same. We had a tense relationship at this point, he was trying to be controlling, I was trying to stand up for myself, we were bickering and I told him it was time to find a new place to crash soon. I made friends with a lady that he apparently didn't like the boyfriend of, he tried to forbid the friendship but I defiantly stayed friends with her. One day my new friend called me and he got upset and again told me I wasn't allowed to be friends with her. We argued, he left, I went out to lunch with my new friend. When she was dropping me back off he was outside and saw me getting out of her car, she even asked why he was looking so mean. I made some excuse then went inside, he has a friend with him so the three of us hung out for a couple hours. It was nice, we had fun, then he took his friend home and I was expecting us to have a nice normal night.\n\nNo, he came back into the house and beat me badly for disobeying him and seeing Kay after he told me he didn't want me to know her. Held me captive again, broke bones, beat me any time I moved. After a day or so of this he went to the bathroom but didn't force me to come in with him so the moment the door was closed I, with a broken leg, hobbled to the front door and made a mad dash out. He heard the door open and chased me out but I made it to the light of a street lamp. I heard voices in the dark and flagged them down asking to use their phone. The neighbor was actually on the phone with someone when he approached me, I heard him say \"Yeah, it looks like he put his hands on her again\" then he got off the phone. My neighbor and his friend convinced me to return to my apartment where they would tell the guy he has to go. They swore they would not hurt him, but they'd make sure he left and understood he was not welcome in the neighborhood again. Upon returning to my apartment the neighbor and his friend confront the guy, everything is going smoothly, they tell him he's gotta go and if he comes back to the complex for any reason the whole neighborhood would step in and get him. He didn't like the threat, he grabbed me and tried to pull me back into the apartment. My neighbor and his friend jumped in, they were beating him up when a truck pulled up. It was the guy my neighbor had originally been on the phone with. The guy jumps out and joins the fight, now its 3 on 1 but my former friend is still holding his own. One of the guys pulled a gun and emptied it into him, then the 3 guys jumped in the truck and took off, they tried to get me to leave with them by pulling me to the truck but I went limp so they left without me. My background is in the medical field, so I held pressure on my former friends chest wounds, kept him talking till medics took over.  He survived but is doing 12yrs for aggravated assault.",

We did it every year. Her home life was rough and we wanted to help the best we could. Turns out that year my friend’s grandmother had been gathering evidence to take to cps in an attempt to help the girls father get custody of her. Their mom was a mess. She had my friend at 14 and was on and off drugs since. They had given full custody of my friend to her grandmother years before I met her so even though I knew her sisters situation was bad I never realized how bad until that night. \n\nWe got driven there by the sisters dad because we wanted to go trick or treating in the nearby rich area that gave out full size candy and toys. We got out of the car and walked in same as every year before that. Went to the kids room and my friend went to talk to her mom while I was making her sister an Elsa braid. I remember a lot of yelling. To the point that this poor 6 year baby girl crawled in my lap and was shaking like a leaf. I picked her up and was gonna just take her to the car and finish her costume prep there. When I walked out of the room my friend’s mother and her boyfriend were fighting and he had a gun pointed at my friend. Her mom was crying (clearly high) and begging him to put the gun away. He said something about us stealing his baby (The kid wasn’t his as they had only been together for about 2 years and this girl was 6) and proceeded to get angrier when he saw me carrying her. \n\nHe tried to get her to go to him but she didn’t and just kept hugging me. It’s worth nothing that me and my best friend had been friends for years at this point and I first met her sister when she was 1. They spent holidays at my house and sometimes lived there for weeks at a time. So me and my parents were a constant safe place in this 6 year olds mind. But yea anyway she was clinging to me sobbing and I didn’t want to let go. She was tiny and scared and at 14 I was old enough to realize that if he got a hold of her we were never gonna see her again. I tried to retreat back into the room but he pointed the gun in my direction and I remember crying but not making any noise. I didn’t want to scare the kid. \n\nLuckily I guess the boyfriend forgot that the kids actual dad was outside in the car waiting for us. He heard the yelling and called 911. I guess when he didn’t hear more yelling he got scared something happened and ran in. I don’t know what would’ve happened if he didn’t. He ran in started yelling at his ex wife about how this was it and now he was getting custody and she could kiss seeing her kids goodbye. She just cried more and her boyfriend was scared of the girls dad so he retreated. He hugged me and his daughter and grabbed my friend’s hand. Sat us in the car while he talked to police and then proceeded like he told the mom to pursue full custody. We still went trick or treating and he bought us a pizza. He talked to my parents and apologized but my parents didn’t think it was his fault since we usually went to that house all the time without previous incidents. How was he supposed to know his ex wife’s boyfriend was gonna go crazy that night. A couple of years after that me and the girl stopped being friends (for various reasons) but I have her aunt on Facebook. Her little sister is big now and seems to be thriving now I assume because her situation got more stable.",

At this point, he had convinced his family (who we were living with at the time) that I was having psychotic breaks and could no longer drive. None of this was true, but this helps set up the story.\n\nGo to the hospital (it's about 11pm), all they do is give me a pamphlet for some psychiatrists and a prescription for a uti. We go home, and everything seems normal, but I knew something was off with him. I wanted to take a shower. We were living in a camper on his grandparent's property with no running water, so I had to use the one in the house.\n\nThis is when the weirdness begins to ramp up. He wouldn't let me keep my hands hidden. He pat me down like a fucking criminal. He's acting like he's so scared of what I'm capable of, when the opposite was true. As I was showering he burst in and tool my towel away, saying I couldn't be trusted with it. When I get out, we try to watch some tv. I'm trying desperately to make smalltalk, but he's giving me cold looks and the silent treatment. He pats down the lining of my winter coat.\n\nEventually I ask him what's wrong. He refuses to tell me, saying I need to tell him. I genuinely have no clue, and this turns into two hours of me begging him to tell me so we can talk about it, him refusing saying I should know, threatening his family members on me to beat me up.\n\nThere's more, but this is getting long, so onto the murdery part. We're back in the camper, and he won't let me leave. It's 1am, and I'm willing to make the 3 1/2 drive in winter just to go home. He has my keys, and physically pushes me away from the only exit. He beat me over the head with my own cellphone, I saw stars. At one point we sat across each other, he hit me in the eye with the back end of a switchblade.

As he pulled into our neighborhood, a vehicle going the opposite direction pulled in behind him. My brother pulled into our driveway and the vehicle that followed him stopped at the bottom of the driveway. Brother just thought it was the neighbors and thought nothing of it. Next thing as brother is exiting his vehicle he gets shot (in the head) by people at the bottom of the driveway. He falls back into his vehicle. Couple people from the car at the foot of the driveway come up and demand his wallet. He's still conscious and gives it to him and they leave.\n\nI was on my way home from the hospital already (my friend had a seizure while driving and wrapped his truck around a tree) when I gotta call from my brother saying he just got robbed. I show up at home around the same time the ambulance did. Now mind you brother doesn't realize he's been shot at this point. He knows he was hit in the head with something and is bleeding. But he never loss consciousness and he's walking around just fine. The paramedics look at his head and say \"just clean it up, you'll be fine\". \n\nAnyway cops get a description of the vehicle and have one stopped matching the description nearby. In the ditch near where they stopped the car, they found brother's wallet and a little .22 pistol. That's when they call us and tell us he's likely been shot and should probabaly go to the ER. At the ER, they give him a quick cat scan and doc says he was hit with a bullet. Bullet never penetrated or fractured his skill but left some brushing on his brain and they wanna admit him until it's gone down. They have to transport him by ambulance to a bigger hospital. The same damn ambulance crew that initially responded to the scene is the one that transported him.\n\nTurns out there were 6 people in the car that shot my brother. 5 of them were juveniles and only one was 18. The 18 year old was a known gang member from a different part of town. Two of the juveniles were his brothers. No one in that car ever said who pulled the trigger. Nothing was ever official, but I'm convinced it was a gang initiation for 18 year olds little brother. All 6 were charged and convicted of agg robbery. The adult had enough of a history that he went to prison for 18 years. I think he's still got like 5 years left. The other 5 got charged as adults and got some sort of super strict probation or something. They never saw the inside of a jail for it.\n\nMy brother was out of the hospital in 3 days. Never had any long term effects from being shot.",

Just walking and snapping his belt to intimidate me.  Literally if the landlord hadnt come home id be dead.\n\nThis happened in september 2016 in farmington maine.  There used to be an article online about it but the page got removed at some point because i went to look it up and the link got removed.  You can see remnants of it if u google “erik cook maine”.\n\nI wanted and tried to press charges but i was completely alone and traumatized (still am) and didnt really have help.

I didnt even have a steady phone service at the time for the prosecutors or whatever to contact me.  \n\nStill have all the photos of all the damage he caused to my body.

Even going as far as to rape me (seems weird to say as we were dating but hed literally force me)….when this happened he was upset because i wouldnt give him my phone to use (i didnt want to because i had been in the process of trying to secure help to escape and didnt want him to see any messages), he broke his a few days prior throwing it because he was mad at me.  He tried to take it from me and eventually did and threw it across the room, i ran to grab it, he obviously chased, struggle ensued and i bit him HARD in the chest as he was pinning me down (he was a fatty with moobs so bit hard on his titty) and that pissed him off and this begins him trying to murder me.  I am a normal girl, educated, not some meth head.  It was just a very shitty situation for me, desperate for housing and staying too long in the abuse because i was so alone.

I remained eerily calm throughout and just kept talking. I asked him a lot of questions about him and his life. Eventually he broke down and decided I was \"too cool\" to kill. He ended up dropping me off at school. I reported it immediately to the school and he was later arrested and put in prison for 10 years. Because of the nature of the crime, he was put on lifetime probation, which is highly unusual.

My mom lives about 6 hours away, so naturally like any mom would do - she planned to come up to town to be with my sister and help her out with the newborn.\n\nHer new husband always had jealousy issues. He would get mad at her when she would hug my brother in law, even smiled at any other male.  \n\nThe weekend before she was to come up here, he started arguing against my mom coming to help, and even used the excuse that \"the baby could die, so why bother?\"  They started arguing, and from what my mom tells me, he yelled \"Te voy a matar, perra mendiga!\" The phrase literally translates to \"Im going to kill you, you begging dog.\"  But the intent of the phrase \"perra mendiga\" basically means \"worthless bitch.\"  He then started to strangle her.  \n\nShe said he got his hands around her throat and started to squeeze when the stool she was on broke and she fell out of his grip. She ran out the door barefoot and ran to her brother's house which is about a mile and a half away.  My uncle wasn't home so she stayed on his front porch until he came home.\n\nShe left him and stayed with my sister for a few months until she told me she and the husband were to meet with their local clergymen to discuss the matter.  I told her I was going to talk to him as well - with the full intent of beating the fuck out of him, and I'm pretty sure she and he knew it. So he actually had the audacity to agree with meeting me as long \"as the cops were around.\"\n\nWe ended up meeting at my moms church and I essentially yelled at him and threatened him for about an hour while her clergy guys were there to keep the peace.\n\nShe decided to stay with him, unsurprisingly/surprisingly, and about 6 months down the line he was mistreating her again, and she left him again.   She moved in with my sister for about a year. During that year, she was making plans to sell the house (which is completely in her name, he has no ownership on it and its paid off), told him to pack his shit and find a different place to live.  The entire time he begged and pleaded with her to return to him.   About a year later, randomly she decided to go visit her cousin in her hometown, and when she got there, she announced she was staying with him again.  \n\nIt's been about two years without incident so far.  She claims he's changed, and everything is going well. I believe my mom believes that, but I don't trust him. My sister and I figured out a system for her to tell us if something goes wrong so we can go get her.\n\nIm almost positive it will happen again, and I told her this.  I also told her that if he ever does anything like that again, I'll kill him. She knows I'm serious, and evidently so does he.\n\nMy mom is the smartest woman I have ever known, and she raised my sister and I to be (somewhat) normal people.

He used to live with his parents, sister and brother. We heard music from sister's room so we knew she's there. We went to my boyfriend's room to hangout and no later than 5 minutes, his sister enters with a knife in a hand and trying to attack us. He was faster and stronger so managed to twist her wrist to release the knife but she was still screaming and attacking. He slapped her and she ran away to her room. Their parents came back, their mom started to scream AT MY BOYFRIEND because we called the police. When police came, she tried to close the doors in their face but they came in, then she threw me out so I couldn't talk with the police.\n\n\n\n\nThe second story is much later. I used to work in a very posh restaurant in the centre of big city. We used to serve breakfasts in the morning. So one Sunday I had 2 tables, was making their coffees behind the bar when I man ran into restaurant. He looked like he was on drugs, smelled of alcohol and started to scream that someone is chasing him and gonna kill him. 39 seconds later another guy ran into and they start to argue. Customers starts to look scared, I was behind bar but it seemed like they were just arguing, nothing big. I left the bar and tried to go to customers to quietly calm them. When I was passing two arguing guys, my manager pushed me, I felt on the floor, guys started to scream even more and ran out of the restaurant. Turns out, when I was passing them, one of them started to take out a knife from his pocket. Thankfully we were all alright but we have no idea what happened with those guys.",

They didn’t even have/use the word “stalker” then, and nobody took it seriously. I did call the police because this guy had filled up my answering machine screaming random abuse, and he’d stand below my apartment window doing the same. All they could do was tell him to knock it off.\n\nThe strange thing was that we’d actually been good friends, but never anything more. I really thought he was gay. I’m not sure what happened, just work or classes, and I wasn’t as available to spend time with him. He took it as a huge insult, and literally tried to destroy my life, and anyone else’s I was close to. He caused a lot of problems, but nothing as bad as he hoped, so that was when the following me and screaming shit started. I knew this guy could be vengeful, so I always had my guard up. \n\nOne night, this literal old troll that my stalker had been hanging out with called me. The troll had had a huge crush on the stalker for YEARS, and stalker realized the troll lived about 250 ft. down the sidewalk from me. Great place to hang out, right? Well, despite being desperately in love, the troll felt obligated to warn me that I was in “deadly peril”. Stalker apparently talked all day every day about how much he wanted to kill me, and all of the ways he’d thought of to do it. Troll told me he’d set on a particular method, and timeline, which cemented Troll’s belief it was going to happen. Troll just wanted me to be aware, he didn’t want me to call the police. Uh, I appreciate the heads up, but no. \n\nI called the cops, and they took that shit very seriously and brought him in for questioning. Of course he denied it all, but I remember two of the cops exchanging a glance before one said, “There’s something really wrong with that boy.” Stalker was very handsome, very intelligent, and extremely charismatic. He wanted to be a politician, and he presented beautifully to 99.9% of the world. But those cops saw something.\n\nThey kept a good eye on me, and made it obvious to him that they were watching him. At some point the obscene phone calls started again, and I called to make another report. Another visit from the cops, where one of them finally said, “We could run him out of town today, but we believe if we do that, he will absolutely find a way to kill you.” They’d spoken with his professors, and stalker was set to get his master’s in a few months and apparently had plans to move then for a job. So we agreed to basically let it go, but increase my “protection”. \n\nThe stalker did indeed graduate and move, ending any further communication. Funny thing, though. I met one of “my” officers for coffee the next fall, to catch up. We got around to talking about the recent horrifying murders of five college students in Gainesville, the perpetrator of which had not been identified at that time. The officer said that their department had contacted Gainesville to offer stalker’s info, because several of them thought he was capable of something like that.",

I got on the first bus to head to the sky train station without anything out of the ordinary. Got on the sky train and still not much to bat an eye at other then you usual drunk crowd. \n\nNow when I reached the bus terminal after the second bus there were only a few of us left on the bus including the sketchy guy sitting in the corner, but as I mentioned its late and on the weekend so just figured that he was just another guy going home. So everyone gets off the bus and I pick up my stuff and get off the bus, I was probably the last or close to the last person to get off.  \n\nAround the whole bus loop they have the stations for buses to pull up and have the departure times posted.

I responded saying No thanks, I don't smoke. \n\nThe guy proceeds to take a step towards me and stabs me twice. Completely random and out of nowhere.

I just ended up falling to my knees and without much thought to it started yelling for help. \n\nLuckily for me there were still some people at the loop waiting for their buses and rushed over to help me. I remember this one girl who I believe was coming from the local mountain from a ski-trip or something like that ended up coming down to the ground and tried to keep me calm.  \n\nI guess one of the by-standers ended up calling 911 and from what I was told, the time from the call being made to the time I got to the hospital was within 20 minutes. The time for the whole event is kind of jumbled in my head.\n\nNext thing I remember the ambulance is there and are loading me onto a gurney and into the ambulance.  I guess the bodies natural reaction is to curl up into a ball to keep vitals safe, but the paramedics kept having to tell me to lay flat so they could do their thing but I remember that being one of the hardest things to do.  I remember them asking me personal questions like my name and where I live, just basic things like that and in my head I knew I knew the answers but at the time just could not vocalize them. I asked the paramedics in there how bad it was and if I was going to make it. Of course they don't answer which at the time frustrated me to no end, but looking back makes total sense, just to not freak me out more then I already was.  Last thing I remember of the night was being wheeled into the ER and grabbing onto someones scrubs...It all kind of went dark after that.\n\nI ended up having surgery on my kidney and heart, and have a scar going from my collar bone to just below my belly-button.  I was put into a induced coma for a few days so my body could heal, And ended up spending another week or so in the hospital after waking up.\n\nFrom what I've been told one of the top cardio surgeons in our province happened to be at the hospital and was able to push a less severe surgery back, to come and do the surgery on me.  If the other patient didn't agree to have their surgery postponed, or that surgeon didn't happen to be there that day there is a good chance I wouldn't be here today.",

            "text": "These aren't technically responses to the OP's question, but they fit the spirit of the question. \n\nBoth of these are old family stories, so they've come to be told more as funny anecdotes about how crazy the women in my dad's family are, rather than about the trauma that made them that way. \n\nI can say for certain that the first is 100% true, I have a copy of the coroner's report somewhere. Knowing about the time period of these stories, I don't really doubt the second one, either. \n\nThe first is about my great-grandmother. Her husband (my great-grandfather) was a sheriff in Texas in the 1931. He was in the barn one evening when one of his \"friends\", a moonshiner that he had threatened to arrest if he didn't stop, rode up on a horse and shot my great-grandfather several times. My grandfather was 10 at the time, and his mother tackled him to keep him from going outside (they were in the house) because she knew he would be shot as well. My great-grandfather crawled around to the front porch and died in her arms. \n\nShe went from leaving the door unlocked and welcoming to keeping a loaded shotgun by the door and instructing family that once they knocked and she asked \"who is it?\" they had to the count of three to answer. After that she was emptying that shotgun through the door. My dad always finished telling me this story with this line: 'So whenever I went over to visit I always started yelling \"Grandma it's me! Don't shoot!\"' He wasn't born until '58, so she was still like that more than 40 years after the incident. \n\nThe other was about my dad's great aunt, I'm not sure which side of the family. Her husband was a drunk, and a mean one at that. He would come home after a night drinking and beat her, often severely. This was during a time period when the police wouldn't interfere in a marriage and would take the man's word explaining away the wife's injuries. She could see where this was headed, but once again the way society was at the time of she left the police were more likely to return her to her husband than arrest him, so she took matters into her own hands.\n\nOne night, after he had come home drunk, beat her, and passed out on the bed she sewed him up in the bedsheets. When he woke up the next morning, she calmly explained to him what he had been doing when he was drunk, and how those actions were unacceptable. She then took her biggest cast iron skillet and beat him until he couldn't move. She then calmly explained to him that if he ever got drunk again that they would repeat that conversation, except next time she would not stop hitting him until he wasn't breathing. He reportedly never touched a drink again. \n\nOn a separate note, my grandfather's son from his first marriage used to go out and drink until he was shot and killed in a drunken bar fight. These three incidents made my grandfather very anti-alcohol, to the point where my dad has never touched it.",

It was summer vacation and I we had went to meet my cousins and some other relatives in Atlantic City for a week or so. On the boardwalk there is a mall that’s all glass and inside there’s this candy shop. So we are there getting candy (as a 9 year old would do) so when all of a sudden as we are walking out the fire alarm goes off. \n\nNow, as a 9 year old, I had been taught to walk towards the exit when the fire alarm goes off. My kid brain had assumed that this was what my parents, cousins, and grandparents were also going to do in this emergency situation. So… I just walk off towards the exit. \n\nKeep in mind this is peak summer on the crowded af Atlantic City Boardwalk in a narrow exit to this mall. \n\nSo I’m walking, thinking my grandfather or whoever is right behind me. Until I get to the exit and turn around and no one is behind me. I freak out, I remember very vividly my name being screamed so loud, I was probably screaming crying. It was so crowded that I didn’t know where anything was because all around me were people trying to get out as well. \n\nOk now the murder part. So as I’m freaking out and am about to scream again, this random pair of hands/arms wrap around my throat and mouth. I only half remember this but apparently the guy was holding me upside down in like a weird chokehold. I got dragged through the crowd being held like this for probably 2 seconds until this lady with her own kid noticed me, screamed and went to help me, so the guy dropped me and ran off. \n\nI was told I almost fell directly on my head but the lady and the crowd half caught me so I was pretty much fine. That lady held on to me until my family was able to make it through the crowd and get to me. \n\nIt turns out that the fire alarm was just a false alarm. And, what I didn’t know, is that the rest of my family had began walking towards the side exit of the mall instead of the front exit (because it was so crowded and apparently we were right next to the side exit lmao). \n\nAlso, please don’t go to hard on my family for not noticing I wandered off, they weren’t drinking or anything like that and they immediately noticed I was gone and came looking for me. It was just one of those crowded areas with bad timing, they are great parents lmao",

He kept trying to bend me over the couch to rape me and I was having none of it. I spit in his face and shoved him off of me. We had a scuffle in the kitchen as I tried to leave so I turned around and tried to get out the other door but it wouldn’t open. \n\nHe was drunk and on a whole bottle of barbiturates and now had trapped me in the back of the house. He was going to kill me before the pills took him. \n\nI got out of his sight but after what felt like a few seconds he found me in the shower on the phone with 911. He broke my phone and ended the call but I’d already given my address and said he was coming for me. \n\nAfter that, I was able to push around him and get outside to scream for help. I had hoped a neighbor or the fire department would hear me before he got to me. But the property was large and I don’t think anyone heard me. He came barreling out with his head still bleeding from when I shoved him down in the kitchen. \n\nHe rammed me into the tree/large shrub in the front yard, still about a city block away from the road. Then he used one hand to cover my mouth and nose while he had the other over my throat squeezing. I bit down on his finger as hard as I could. I got a little blood but he didn’t falter. I beat on him with everything I had. I don’t think he even felt it. \n\nWithin about two minutes of struggling, three sheriff SUVs come up the long gravel driveway and men are jumping out of the vehicles with tasers. Three tasers didn’t take my ex husband down but it was enough to make him let go. \n\nHe tried to take the car but was blocked in and eventually arrested. Apparently, after the struggle he lost consciousness and needed his stomach pumped. He was in a medical coma for over a week and then in jail for about two weeks. He got felony domestic assault charges. \n\nOne Sheriff was kind and helped me file a restraining order in the days following. The other two mocked me for being with that asshole. They acted like it was my fault. \n\nFor some reason I still loved him then. I never reported the attempted rape (or the successful attempts before that). I didn’t tell them how long I was there, suffocating in the tree. I covered for him and I regret it. I wanted him to get DBT.\n\nAbusive relationships are hard. The two weeks he was in jail gave me so much peace and clarity that I knew I had to stay away forever. \n\nIf you have been feeling like it’s time to leave. Just do it and never look back. This is how it ends and some are not as lucky as I am. \n\nIt’s 8 years later and I still worry for my safety because he pops around every once in a while. See? He DIDN’T kill himself and he didn’t actually want to. Don’t let them make you stay because they threaten you with that either.",

They turned me into some weird mandatory friend of his and would take me out of class to go calm him down and play games with him because he took a shine to me after I forgave him.  After they stopped pulling me out of classes he attacked some other kid to try and make a new friend and got transferred out.  \n\n2: This spans multiple years.  Art class in maybe like 4th grade?  Class bully is a huge kid standing behind be in line to leave the class.  Wraps his art smock around my throat, lifts me off the ground and just holds me there.  I have no memory of how I got loose or the immediate aftermath.  \n\nFast forward to 9th grade, had a toxic relationship with a girl who was suicidal and she would always call me when she was about to do it, all that red flag behavior.  She ends up transferred to one of those behavioral schools for a few months.  She met the kid who was randomly choking me out and he decided they were now a couple. He stalks her, shows up to her house and her parents just let him in.  Sexually abuses her. In an unrelated incident his family calls the police and rumor was he put his mom in the hospital.  Off to juvie.  \n\nAnother couple of years later in 11th grade, and I shit you not this kid is next to me IN ART CLASS. Spends the year making shitty edgy art taking about how he's a pacifist now.  One day he starts talking about how his ex was such a troubled girl.  A really crazy chick who really should have just killed herself.  I told him he wanted to just stop talking, right now. The people at my table knew something was off because I was generally the quiet kid.  \n\nHe shut up and waited for our teacher to get some supplies.  That door closed and he picked me up by my neck. Not choking me out just like holding me off the ground. I was weirdly calm that everything came back full circle and told him if I wasn't back on my feet in 5 seconds i was going to fight my way down.  He laughed and said \" Don't you know? I'm a pacifist. I'd never hurt anyone, you just needed to calm down.\" He puts me down and the teacher rushed in after a student went and got her.  Off to the office he goes.  \n\nLater that week he grabbed a girl by the face and slammed her into a locker.  Never saw him again.  I have to this day no idea how the hell he was still in the same school district with his history.  The end.\n\nNeither of these rate anywhere close to most of the stories here, but it's weird how those memories got stirred up after reading some of these.",

            "text": "Detroit for anyone who’s wondering. One time my friend and I were walking underneath a bridge along the train tracks. Tracks stretch for miles connecting all the cities from detroit to pontiac. We had come across a few people before on the tracks and some strange scenarios, but nothing like this. We both lived with our houses next to the tracks so it was quite common for us to walk between houses using the tracks as a traffic free  quick straight shot. We were just passing this bridge when we hear “Hey you guys ! stop wait up!”, or something along the lines. We turnt around to see four dudes running down the steep slope from above the bridge, sliding down and flagging us down. My friend and I were a bit startled but being young and naive, we waited for these guys. They ran up and stopped one by one and the first guy just goes “What’s up y’all? Y’all tryna smoke some weed?”. We had just purchased edibles and ate them, so that was all we had on us. The demeanor of this guy who had asked us was like he was in a rush, but also like he was holy, Like “You guys don’t wanna pass up the chance to smoke with US”. It was the tone of the voice and body motion which caught me as welcoming but a little alarming since he seemed so, rushed or worked up i guess. The four dudes introduced themselves as just graduated seniors from a neighboring high school we’d never even seen before, but it did exist. we walked up the hill to the underneath of the bridge , and the whole time three of the dudes were just talking messing around and somewhat talking to us. It was the guy who had first told us to wait who was interested in us, asking us our names and all that. He told us his name was Axle. Skinny white kid, looked like a stereotypical country boy who liked hunting. Orange and wooded camo clothes. He pulled out a dugout and started smoking with us, that’s when he really started to ask us questions like “where y’all going what are we doing how old are we where we lived” which started to seem quite personal as if he was trying to dissect our lives to make a decision, still acting hastily as if boosted up of coke. I hadn’t noticed, but my friend and i were sharing the weed ourselves while this dude just watched and didn’t smoke, with one hand behind his back in the waist band. We smoked his weed talked for a few after they all shared a bit about themselves and then we went on our way. Flash forwards about a year, i’m with my friend walking through a wooded trail when lord behold i recognized one dude we were walking past as a guy who was amongst the four. A nerdier looking dude with a sega shirt on, he seemed cool from when we first encountered. This dudes name was zack or some shit. I said whattup remember me all that he was like fuck yeah and he told me that that same day we ran into them, Axle had a gun and was planning on shooting us to rob us for our shit Including our shoes our clothes phone and everything. He said Axle was on drugs and needed shot to trade or sell. We smoked a blunt then went our separate ways. Another year goes by i’m with a different sort of trusted friend and we went to this dudes house he knew to buy weed. This guy was like a major dealer as he had suitcases full of drugs i hadn’t heard of, all sorts of pills powders crazy shit. There was this one dude in his basement who again i had recognized from the original four, this dudes name was Graham. He was beaten up badly eyes swollen nose trusted stitches and shit begging for anon to give him free pain drugs. I asked if he remembered me and he was like holy shit you were with axle that one time blah blah blah he ends up telling me his face is all fucked up and his arms broken and lungs punctured cause axle stole drugs from some mexican group and they got into a street skirmish. Only for a couple days later axle to rob this big dealer guy and apparently graham. They told me axle had been doing drugs for a couple years now progressively got worse and now robbed everyone he could for dope money, ran away from home at the age 19 to live in a van driving around 7 mile, and was now wanted by the dealer guy whose house i was sitting inside of. This dude was huge mean and had lots of guns so it was kind of alarming to see how close i was to some serious violence of what i’d consider to be gang and drug affiliated crimes.",

I was working in that small town and trying to sort my life out. We had a good relationship up until she stole some money I had, she basically did it in front of my eyes. Shit escalated quickly and shortly after she sold me to one of her son's friends. Thankfully I overheard that while trying to sleep and managed to get out of the house. I just felt so vulnerable.\n\nThat wasn't the end of it, she went full psycho and started threatening everyone on behalf of me(this I found out later on). One day I had to go to a city nearby with one of my girlfriends and her granny and I just had the strangest feeling the whole day we were shopping together. Long story short an organized band tried to rob us, they were pretty new at it and managed to stay one step ahead and get a hold of the situation. When we reached the terminal I was still in fight mode untill my companions took their bus. I had to go to my hometown to visit my family. The bus I rode was unusually empty and it seemed weird that the driver hopped off before I got in. Then when the trip started there was a new driver and just 3 more people, apart from me, on the bus.\n\nI was talking with my friend over the phone trying to calm her down and it just seemed weird that I was not completely calmed down at the moment. I told her I'd talk to her soon and hung up. The person in front of me was on the phone and had one of the strangest conversations I've ever heard. He was supposedly talking with his SO but it was just so unnatural. I strated texting my friends on the phone just to relief some of the stress. Then the guy in front finished the call but then the driver started talking over the phone and using code words in wich I'd describe as intimidation. He was talking about some \"extra passenger\" that had to be \"disposed\". I was full tilt right there and called my best friend but he didn't pick up so I just played it cool and made the other people think the call was still ongoing. Right when I reached the main highway of my city I told the driver to stop so I could hop down. He refused to do so and I told him that there were people waiting for me and his whole demeanor changed and he stopped in the next intersection.\n\nI reached my house and told my parents about what happened and also that my boss had threatened me over a french fry(that was at the beginning of the month) I thought it was relevant information because my ex-boss is a politician. They told me to relax and to just take a break and to go back to the town. I decided to go back to work but I didn't go alone. I reached the town and hopped off at my job and right when I opened the door I just had the most gut wrecking felling I've ever felt. I withered. I told my boss I was not going to be working and he told me to do some task before I left and so I did. He was acting all weird throughout the short time we interacted. I finished my task and right when I was going to leave my girlfriend reached the place(she worked there as well). I gave her a hug, unknowingly the last one, and then I left to my city.\n\n2 days went by and made some plans with my friends to go out and enjoy Karaoke night. The place was really nice and we had an overall good time. I even got to reunite with some friends from school that showed up to the place. But approaching midnight 2 hitmen came into the place and I had to run out of that bar. They couldn't do much because the place was really crowded.\n\nI ended up moving out of my own city but the trip wasn't completely smooth. The first bus I took to the city where I had to take my plane was almost empty and it took a turn and ended up taking a completely different direction. I got out of that bus and had to walk all the way to the terminal. On the second bus I took the bus was packed and 2 ex-miltars in front again started intimidating me. My phone was dead and there's a part of a trip where there's no signal, the person travelling beside me lended me his phone and I called my mother. I told her I went to the Investigation Department and they gave me an emergency number and also an email where I could send my report of what happened the prior days. They guys shut their mouth and left the bus in a different stop they said they were going to, almost the first stop, they said they'd go all the way to the terminal wich is the last stop(my stop was second to last). \n\nWhen I reached my new city all the info I needed reached me and I just felt so betrayed by everyone involved. The street term for what almost happened to me is social cleansing. It is a pretty awful experience that none deserves to go through, thankfully I made it out alive even though I was completely innocent people die wrongly accused. Not like the completely guilty should go down like that either this shouldn't happen today. It also revived memories from the past. I'm much better now and I started studying what I love and the relationship with my family has gotten better.",

I stumble around calling out her name and cannot find her, but the scent gets stronger as I move towards the bathroom.

I was shocked.  Stunned.  I could see her chest rising and falling so I knew she was alive, but beyond that I was utterly paralyzed.  Before I can finish asking her what in the world happened, she got to her feet.  My first thought was to reach out in case she slipped - there was blood all over the tub - but she must have seen it as threatening, and she lunged at me with the knife.  \n\nThere wasn't anything of the woman I was dating at the time still in her.  Her face was emotionless.  It didn't even look like she was looking directly at me, but passed me.  Maybe she was, maybe that's why I lived.

I told her as much and next thing I know she cornered me and wrapped a vaccuum cord around my throat. She pulled it tight and stared at me with gritted teeth as I struggled desperately to free myself. Luckily we were close to the front door so I managed to open it, praying someone would see and help. I was close to passing out by this time. When my mother realized the door was open, she stopped. Immediately. It was so jarring for her to do this 180. She drove me to work and never mentioned it again until she realized I told another adult and it was reported to Children’s Aid (they help kids up to 18 where I live), then I was in huge sh*t and things got so much worse. So this is the story of how my mom tried to murder me AND I was a 16 year old who had to move out on my own :D",

But i did have \"Fake friends\" wich was made up of  five people from the same apartment complex i lived in. Me, being a very guilable child, always hung out with them, not realising that they weren't treating me right. By that i mean they did really messed up stuff to me, like for example : shoot soapy water in my eye, blame me even though i clearly didn't do nothing and sometimes just beating tf out of me.\n\nWe had this thing were we did a sleep over every second week and they obviously always bullied me hard on those days. Yet, i am probably the least agressive person out there and never did anything against it.  \n\n\nNow we come to the Fun part :)  \n\n\nIt was one of those sleep over events and we discoverd something new. The persons house we were sleeping at had bunkbeds, so we took the top mattress and layed it on the floor to jump on it from the top. Keep in Mind that at that day i already was really pissed bc they have been pushing me around the whole day. So we continued jumping until a fluke happend. Me and a girl my age were on the top and the other kids tried jumping backwards and wanted us to try it aswell. Me, being the scared kid, obviously didn't wan't to do it. The girl was was on top with me, pushed me down and jumped right after not realising that i would need time to move out of the way. She compleatly crushed my crotch area with her knee. Me, who was already pissed and full of adrenaline, didn't feel anything but bloodlust at that moment. So i instinctivly grabbed a pillow and tried to suffocate her with it. I was in complete rage, there were veins poping out of my face, tears and slob dripping on to the pillow, with me just using my full force while screeching. That kept going for about 90 seconds until i realized that i am actually killing a person. After realizing, i let go and went home, sprinting and crying. Closing the door to my apartment with a big bang. I told my Mom not to open the door under any circumstances and shut myself in my room.  \n\n\nAnd yeah that's it.

By this point my vision was beginning to blur on the right side with blood and probably impact trauma.\n\nTurns out it was the guy, who had been lied to by his wife saying I’d known of her marriage, and that I’d met her and had relations with her. None of which was true.\n\nIn later months I found out she was covering for another man she’d been having an active affair with.\n\nAfter I managed to fight off his attack, he hopped in his car and sped off, not without warning he’d be back.\n\nI laughed this off ( I wasn’t really afraid off too much, we are all human, anything you can do to me I’m capable of returning)\n\nA year passed by, several hospital visits for my face, some stitches and a few months looking over my shoulder every now and then and I’d completely forgotten about it.\n\nA year, almost to the day, I was walking down the main high street of my town in the middle of an afternoon on a weekend, so it was busy…\n\nAnd I hear people begin to shout as I’m walking, I turn behind me to see a car up on the pavement speeding down toward me as people leap out of its path…\n\nI run maybe a couple of meters ahead of me and dive in the door of a small shop, seconds after this car crashes into the doorway of said shop and reverses, stops and out jumps this same guy, sides the hood of his car and charges into the shop swinging at me, this time I fight back fast, backing him out of the shop.\n\nThe owner already calling the police, the man panics and hops back into his car and once again says ‘I’ll be seeing you’.\n\nIf I had not seen that car coming I’d be dead, I know this without a doubt, this man has intended to do me serious harm both times he’s tried.\n\nIt’s been almost two years now and I’ve not seen him since, I know I will one day.

            "text": "My gf at the time needed a roommate, and accepted the very first guy she was contacted by via Craigslist. A few weeks go by and red flags are everywhere. He steals Foster's beers from the grocery store accross from the apartment and is always *wasted* by about 10 pm.\n\nOur neighbor Jessica regularly came by, and if we weren't home yet she would hang out in the living room with CL James until we got back. One night me, gf and Jessica all get back from the bar. CL James is lit on the couch, gf and Jessica join him in the living room while I start cooking some late dinner in the next room. I hear a drunken argument between drunk Jessica and Drunk James. Not even loud, more a heated wasted back and forth. Then my gf runs in the room and tells me James punched Jessica in the face.\n\nNow Jessica was a large enough chick to put up a fight, so by the time I run in and get between them they are kind of shoving each other and James reaches back to punch her *right in front of me.* I had been trying to tell them both to stop, but when he went to swing I popped him in the face. A full on brawl ensues, knocking over the living room table, punches flying. I get him pinned, and he reaches up and tries to strangle me. \n\nMaybe because he is wasted, maybe because he was already concussed, but his grip was weak and I was basically able to tuck my chin and still breath with his hands around my neck. I start effectively choking him, and the girls start kicking him. We are all yelling for him to \"Give up! Say Uncle! Stop fighting!\"\n\nHe finally taps out on my arm, I get up and stand over him. After a few seconds of catching his breath I help him up. As soon as he gets to his feet he swings for my head, misses, and I get behind him and put him in a headlock. I take him to the front door which is next to the staircase. I am able to pin him on the stairs he tries to kick at me but I hold him there while GF opens the door and we boot him outside and lock the door.\n\nAs we are calling the police, he is going from window to window yelling creative death threats about how he will come back with his daddy's gun, how he will murder us all etc etc. He kicks over my moped, starts kicking my car, alternating between trying to get me to come outside and then trying all the doors and windows to get back in. Eventually the cops show up and arrest him.\n\nFrom the back of the car he is still yelling death threats as we all give statements. He is even threatening the police and swearing constantly.. The police clearly don't care for him, and they ask to get into his room to get his wallet for him. We let them in, the room is a mess but his wallet is on the bedside where he said it was. They say \"I don't see it\" and leave. The vibe seemed to be \"fuck this piece of trash\"\n\nFast forward a year or two, police show up at my work. They came to me because I was the last person to press charges against CL James. They ask if I've seen him, and to repeat what happened before. They are very interested in how he tried to put his hands around my neck and how he hit Jessica.\n\nThen they told me most details, the rest I saw in the newspaper and through a couple I knew who ran my storage unit. Their daughter was found beaten and strangled in the back of her own car. CL James was in the driver's seat, she was covered with a blanket. The police were called because an intoxicated CL James had a disturbing amount of blood on his white shirt when he came into the gas station to buy Fosters. He then proceeded to sit in the car at the gas station and drink beer. The police showed up to ask about the drinking in the car and saw the blood. They saw the registration was female and asked to search the car. She was a friend of his who was just in town for the weekend, they had been out drinking together.\n\n\nFor me it was less of a murder attempt then an altercation, but had my ex and I not been around I think he would've murdered our neighbor, and he did murder my friends daughter.\n\nTl;Dr\n GF let's a CL murderer stay in her apartment until an altercation lead to his arrest for beating a female in our living room. He later killed a female in her own car and was found with her body in the back of the car drinking at a gas station.",

            "text": "Serendipity happened. I saw a screw drop to the floor that I knew I hadn't unscrewed while I taking apart some scenery after a musical, and I was so confused that I bent down to inspect it. The second I bent down a giant heavy hunk of plywood flew against the back of my skull with such force that when it slid off me it cleanly severed 8 bundled 1\" diameter saw cords behind me. I was unconscious standing up for about a minute and had no vision for 30 seconds after waking up. Had it not bent down it would've been my neck that got severed.\n\nThe context: I went to a US based international boarding school for high school that had a number of exchange programs and also give students the option to take theater tech as a sport option twice each year. That particular year they added some school in the UAE to the program without taking into account that a lot of families rich enough to be in that school had live in migrant servants from Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, and, therefore, might have some racial hangups.\n\nThe girl who came to my school was the quiet type of racist who simply refused to hold eye contact with or talk to those she deemed \"servant class\". She was very modest (didn't want cheering spectators) and didn't like hard work, so she refused the real sports options, even the all all-girls pilates class option, in order to do theater tech because someone joked to her that it was \"varsity arts and crafts\". She was taken by surprise that we had a real stage with a lift in a 600 seat theater, a black box theater, a full carpentry shop, and a rigging system, which included the ability to suspend/fly our student actors; this school honestly has a better theater set up than a lot of arts colleges. She was already miffed that she'd have to be on her hands and knees making load bearing scenery from scratch and learning how to use power tools. She went utterly ballistic when she learned that I, *that Black one*, would be one of the crew leads teaching her how to do everything and that the only other options were two male students who she refused to work with. She even tried to campaign to become her own shift lead and do work calls on another shift than me, but she didn't even know how to use a screwdriver and got shut down. \n\nShe went about the three months of build acting like an irritable toddler around me, but I managed to teach her how to use an impact wrench and construct basic platforms. Our show was The Secret Garden, so we ended up making these 8ft tall x 8ft wide x 4ft thick moving \"bushes\" that were faced with two layers of inch thick plywood on all sides that I had her bludgeon with a hammer for texture and irregularity. This 2\" thick 4ft x8ft sheet was the heavy hunk of plywood that hit me. She waited until I had turned away from the bush I was breaking down, climbed on top of it when I thought she was on the floor working on the other side, and readied the board against the top edge to shove down at my neck when I turned back around. If her dumbass remembered my rule of picking up every screw you unscrewed, it would have never fell, I would have never bent to pick it up, and I probably would have been beheaded where I stood. I've never seen such a look of hatred as the scowl she made when my vision came back and I saw her perched like a gargoyle above me on that bush.",

He thinks he has behavioral problems from so many concussions and so much head trauma. I agree. \n\nBy the time this happened, we were in the middle of a breakup I had initiated. I was sleeping in the spare bedroom, he came home wasted. He woke me up and demanded I sleep in the bed with him. I’m a lot smaller than him and was a little scared of him, even though he’d never been violent. I complied. He passed out, I couldn’t sleep so I was texting my girlfriend from work, trying to make a plan to leave. He woke up, saw me texting, and flipped out. He was completely naked. I was in pajamas. I jumped up and ran out of the room, grabbing my contact lenses and makeup bag and nothing else. I ran downstairs, he caught me at the front door. He picked me up by my neck and held me against the wall, alternatively strangling me and bashing the back of my head against the wall.\nI don’t remember exactly what happened, but he dropped me, I was able to crawl through his legs and run out the front door. \n\nThis was February in the Rocky Mountains. I ran to the neighbor’s house (H, another friend who was also his coworker, and who knew we were breaking up and how his temper could be). He tried to break into her back doors. He failed. We didn’t call the police that night for a lot of reasons, but I did go to the police next day to get a restraining order. They declined to help me. This was a well known and well loved guy in our tiny town; I left after being told it was a “one off” and he needed to “get it out of his system”. I had strangulation marks on my entire neck and popped blood vessels in my eyes. They told me to get some rest and to try not to antagonize him. \n\nHe moved out and I stayed in the house. He began to stalk me. Like I said, it was a very small resort town, not much more than a mile square. My friends would call me and tell me where he was so I could avoid him. His friends, who had formerly been my friends, would see me on the street and call me all kinds of horrible names. He called me incessantly. One day, driving around with H, the calls came one after another. I had over 100 missed calls from him in under an hour. She said it was time to get a restraining order. We went to the police, showed them the call log, and I was able to petition to get a restraining order. They told me I’d also have to press charges for the assault, and made it seem like I probably shouldn’t because it would hurt his career. I did. The DA (who was later charged with DV and financial abuse against his wife) wouldn’t charge him with attempted murder, although all parties agreed that was his intent, his defense argued successfully that he was “not of sound mind” because he was drunk and therefore did not mean to try to kill me. He plead out and got his guns taken away and had to go to 40 hours of anger management classes. He got his guns back legally after 90 days and my order of protection against him expired after one year. \n\nHe moved out of the country not long after we went to court. After he left, he never tried to contact me again. He lives back in the states now, is married and has a food truck in the Midwest. I don’t wish him ill but I certainly don’t wish him well, I just hope he continues to leave me alone. This morning I found out a good friend of his is an investor in a business I’m involved with through work. I just let me boss know that I can’t be involved in the project anymore. I don’t think I am in any danger, but you can never be too sure. I’ll always be scared of him. \n\nAs a fun (~s) aside, my friend H moved to my city about 5 years ago, which was about 4 years after the incident. She asked me if I still talked to him. I was shocked, of course. I told her no, he had tried to kill me, you were there. Her response was “that’s not how I remember it. Y’all need to bury the hatchet. Just let that shit go.” I have not spoken to her since.",

I saw this girl along with another friend of hers talking at the parking lot holding a pepsi bottle. As I passed them I said hi and she just waved. I picked up my notebook and was about to go back home when she called me out and asked if i wanted pepsi. Normally I would have taken a sip of it but that day for some reason I said no. She insisted, but I still said no and hurried back home and didn't think of it.\nNext day those two girls didn't show up for the exams and we all wondered what happened. After the exam I was called into the principal's office and was asked if I saw them both previous day and what happened. I told them everything we conversed. \nI was told that they had attempted suicide and are in hospital in critical stage. They had mixed rat poison with pepsi and drank it. Real reason seems to be love failure. I happened to cross her path and in that moment she had thought to take me also with her.\nI was so shaken after hearing that. She did recover eventually but I never went to see her or meet her again.",

            "text": "A wierd one here. \n\nIn middle school, 7th grade, I was pretty tall, 5,11. I was about 13 14 dont remember. I had this really rough relation with this one kid who had joined that year and i had joined that school that year before. I was still only just getting used to the place and this new school and this kid too but he had just transfered from a different branch so he was pretty used to processes and stuff. For some reason he always acted like he was better than everyone and everyone in that school was very nice, so nice infact that in the short time i had been there those guys became really great friends with me and i held them really highly in my heart. This new kid was really not nice and this one time me qnd my other friends were just paying around, we were very physical, just pushing each other around, playfully btw we knew each other limits and what we were ok with, and this is almost near the end of the year so we knew this other kit pretty well to and while were playing we just barely brushed against him, JUST barely like not even full sholder to shoulder like just the muscles on the side of the shoulder of my friend who i pushed barely BRUSHES againt the other kids. And about a whole minute later when were dont playing and on out way back to class this other kid chargers up and takes a running start and fucking yeets my friend that i was walking next to. My friend fucking collapses on the ground and the fucking sheer force of the push has me on my ass aswell. I get up. I'm mad as fuck. The other kid looks at me and says \nyou two pushed me back there\nI go up to him and i give him a decent push, nit enough to make his fall but juuuust enough to make bim lose his balance for a only a fraction of second but grab the wall next to him anyway. The fucking kid walks back up to and punches me right between the eyes. I wear glasses, i wore them back then too, i was wearing them right there too! My glasses fall off off and right between the two lenses when the bridge is and where that part sits on my face on top of the nose i start bleeding just a little bit, i dont notice at first but i see the blood between  my just and then it falls on my white shit. I fuckig lose my shit. Im not a violent person. I wasn't one back then i am not one now never was never have been never will be. I get really angry ALOT. I get that from my dads side. My dad my grand dad and his father before him all had huge tempers my uncles even. They, my dad, especially were very self conscious and they all tried their best to contain it and that rubbed off on me pretty well. I always felt that anger in my head like it made my head almost burst open but i always had it in me to keep it in and not let it out. Always found a way to distract my self or just bury that negativity down and just forget about it. But this time i didn't want to forget i didn't want  keep in all in the head. I went and pushed the kid first, made him fall waited till he was just about to get up to kick him in the face and then when he was down i went up tk his head and i was wearing dress shoes as part of the uniform and they had this really tough hard wooden heel and i knew it did and i always knew that if that had some decent momentum and hit someone in the shit or something it would really hurt. And i was fucking stomping on this kids face just non stop i remember to this day i was trying to make sure he wouldn't get up from where he was lying i didn't want to stop i made sure i was getting him on his teeth and i made sure i got his eyes i made sure i couldn't see his nose poke out of his face i made sure it was all flat. It got bloody really soon, his face and my shoe and other kids started crying and all and the teachers got there pretty fast after i had him on the floor and i had it in my head that i wanted that kid DEAD dead so if the teachers hadn't got to me as fast as they did that other kid would've actually been DEAD dead, im sure.",

After a couple of years, the aggressor had become radicalized and delusional in his unmedicated schizophrenia.

He was arrested two or three days later after he attacked me at work, strangled me on camera, destroyed store product, threatened my coworkers and customers... and now, after a few years of stalking me online and another few dealing with the court system, he has a conditional house arrest sentence and a 20-year registration in the sex offender registry. They dropped all of the other charges (forcible confinement, assault, sexual assault, etc.) and went with the easiest (sexual interference) because, despite all the evidence, the court didn't know how much his unmedicated schizophrenia factored into his behaviour. I am of the opinion that they have further stigmatized persons with schizophrenia because being schizophrenic doesn't mean you groom, lure, abuse, threaten, and stalk a child now woman for 17 years.",

            "text": "I was nearly gutted by the angry son of some foreign general named Asad, the country I don't recall, but they hated Jewish people I remember that.  \n\nAsad had problems.  His dad was actually a very personable guy, but teased his son mercilessly in front of his friends, which caused him no end of teen angst. He had a lot of racist in him, too, and I had a biology lab partner who was some girl of middle eastern origin, and he said women didn't need education to be subservient to man and some such bullshit. He went around telling everyone his name mean \"loin\" in his language, which we all thought was kind of weird, until my lab partner corrected him.  \"It means, 'Lion.' Do you know what 'loin' means in English?\"  And the entire class laughed at him, and called him \"Groin\" for a while.  The big thing was he would bully people to cheat off their papers, since his English comprehension obviously wasn't all that great, even though he spoke it fairly fluently. \n\nThe biology teacher we had kind of checked out late in his career. He'd leave the classrooms during exams, so copying was pretty rampant and open.  Asad didn't have many friends, so he would just get up and \\*steal your exam\\* and copy his line for line.  He did that to me a lot, because I got good grades, and it wasn't so much he was intimidating, he just took it before I had time to react, and then threatened to tear it up if you didn't let him copy.  One day, during the mid-terms, I took the exam before the school day started (with the teacher's approval, especially when i explained why), and then in biology class, purposely got every question wrong.  And I mean, wrong.  If there was an A,B,C,D choice?  I'd put \"E.\"  What kind of plant uses photosynthesis?  Ford Motor Plant. And so on. And because his English was not strong, and he was copying line for line, he didn't notice.  He got a zero, and wanted conference with his parents about it, especially since he had made some insults to the biology teacher (listing the teacher's daughter as a form of mushroom, for instance).  He was FURIOUS at the teacher, and said the teacher was lying because I got a B+ and he got a zero, and he had the same answers as me.  \"And that's why I want to speak to your parents.  We set you up.\"  Why the teacher didn't just stay in the room during the exam, I don't know.  Of course, his parents were embarrassed and furious at him.\n\nOne of my D&D buddies hated him, and after this whole debacle carved on a school desk, \"Asad is a commie rat-assed Arab.\" I don't know if Asad was actually Arabic, but he had dark middle-eastern skin, so this buddy just assumed. I didn't know HE had done it until much later.  And that was it.  Asad snapped.\n\nI was walking around my neighborhood, and Asad rode past me on his Vespa, stopped, backed up, jumped off his scooter and ran up to me.  He pulled out a knife, I think a butterfly knife, and stuck it in my belly.  He didn't got much deeper than a shaving cut, but it cut through my tee-shirt and drew a little blood.  He then looked deep into my eyes, accused me of writing that thing on the desk, and to give him an excuse not to gut me like a fish right then and there.  Because this was before my buddy owned up to it, I didn't even know what the hell he was talking about.  He told me \"Mike,\" someone we both knew, had told him I did it.  And despite having no anti-semitic upbringing, literally the first thing I thought of was, \"so you believe the word of a Jew?\"\n\nI still feel bad I said that.  WTF.\n\nAnyway, it was the right thing to say to HIM, as I knew how much he hated Jews, and hated Mike in particular, because Mike was \"an uppity Israelite\" or something. This question broke his brain.  I don't know if he made up that Mike said it or what, but in order to proceed, he would have to admit he was acting upon the word of a Jew, and I could see his anger suddenly break in indecision.  He put his knife away, patted my belly, and said, \"You're LUCKY!\" and zoomed away on his Vespa.",

He had forced me a couple times and had hit me during fights but coming from a home with DV, I didn’t really think anything was wrong at the time. \n\nI came home to find him in bed with his best friend. His male best friend. They had been having a relationship for years at that point and I had zero clue. At the time I was unaware but I was newly pregnant, and the shock of seeing them, I threw up right there. He came swinging at me, as I was struggling to straighten back up. He landed a few blows and I went to run. Our bathroom was down the hall a bit and I managed to get inside and lock the door. Shitty door. He kicked it in immediately after I locked it and just rained down punches and kicks. At no point do I remember his friend being there, so he must have left as this all went down. I’m not sure how long he beat me, but I did come to briefly after. I have super fuzzy memories of seeing blood all around me in the bathroom and just insanely intense pain. When I woke up again, I was in our bed. No blood, but bruises and sores all over my body. My face felt super tender and my eyes were swollen. My stomach and chest were so sore it hurt to breathe. My boyfriend wasn’t there but there was water by the bed and he’d obviously cleaned me up. I chugged the water even though it hurt and trying to clear my head. I couldn’t and I realized I was really really hot. Disoriented and kind of sweaty. Eventually he showed back up but I was getting worse. At some point I passed back out and came to in the hospital. I have no idea how much time passed between the attack and going to the hospital. I also have no idea what he told them. I was there for two weeks recovering. I had to have a DNC and I had a broken rib. I was very lucky it wasn’t worse. They tried to talk to me a few times but I had been raised with a no talk policy when it came to police and didn’t help myself stupidly. I eventually went home with him and convinced him that I need to go where my parents were. Looking back I’m terrified for young me, because that meant driving through the desert. I think if I had fought harder to leave him during that time, maybe he would have finished the job but I just kept insisting that we just needed a fresh start in a new place. When we got to where they were, one of my moms friends stepped in and gave me a place to stay away from him. She saved my life, because he definitely would have snapped again. He actually passed away years later after being beaten to death. I cried and laughed when I found out. Trauma is weird. Between this and my childhood, my psychiatrist stays busy.",

Everybody else was drinking/playing pong. Word got around the party that the 3 of us had taken acid and a younger girl (19) came over with her boyfriend (33) and asked if we had any more that she could have. I didn’t know either of them, but the guy had a generally creepy vibe about him. It’s hard to describe and I was already starting to trip pretty hard, but he was being really weird about buying this acid for her. Anyway we sold them a couple hits she took them and went about their business. \n\nMy friends and I were full on tripping shortly after and we decided we would go for a walk. A few people at the party inquired as to where we were going and we told them we were gonna go for a brief walk to enjoy the scenery outside. The girl must have heard us and decided she wanted to go with us so we obliged. Her boyfriend stayed at the party and we went and walked around the adjacent neighborhoods. We had a good time and we were all vibing and having a good time. Nothing weird or flirty just 4 people enjoying our trips together. \n\nI didn’t think we were gone for very long, but who knows we were all peaking by then. Right about as we were re-entering the neighborhood to get back to the party she gets a phone call and seemed immediately distressed. It was brief, but she was obviously defensive and worried. As soon as she hangs up this guy comes screeching around the corner in his car and stops maybe 30-40 yards away. We had stopped completely and we’re just watching as he turned his car right towards us, peels out, and drives right into our group scattering all of us. The 3 of them ran to the left as I ran right. He backs up turns right in my direction and tries to run me over again. I ran as fast as I could out of the way and behind a nearby shed. He backs up again and stops right next to the other 3 and gets out of the car. I can see them yelling back and forth while I am observing from my safe position behind the shed.\n\nAt this point I am full on tripping on LSD and pure adrenaline and am having trouble processing what even just happened. The threat seems gone with him out of the car and my other 2 friends with our new female friend and I finish the quick walk though some neighbors yards and back to the party. As soon as I get inside people can see that things are not ok from my face and ask what’s wrong. I tell them that dude just tried to run us over with his car. A handful of guys from the party rush outside as the other 3 come walking inside. The girls is crying hysterically and my friends tell me that the other guys are dealing with the perpetrator. We all decide we are just gonna get the fuck out of there and walk through a field and some yards (avoiding streets) to my apartment about a mile away. \n\nAt my place the girl tells us how her boyfriend is crazy jealous and has several domestic violence charges. At the time my daughter was 3 years old (she was at her moms for the weekend for parent time) and I went full on dad mode.

I happened to be hanging out near a friend’s apartment when a local bully came upon me. We started having a snowball fight and I hit him in the face with one. He went in to full rage mode… he chased me down, tackled me, put his hand on the back of my head and submerged it in the snow. He had his knee on my back to make sure I couldn’t get away. \n\nLuckily someone saw what was happening and yelled at him to get off me. He hadn’t held me down for more than 30 seconds so although my mouth and nostrils were full of snow I was unharmed. He later apologized saying that he didn’t realize that what he was doing could have killed me. I’d later find out he had a TBI that caused his mood swings, as well as developmental delays and lowered cognitive functioning. We sort of became friends after that, though whenever he saw me he never failed to say something like “hey, remember that time I almost killed you?”\n\nThe other attempts were by my stepfather by various means. His favorite though was to slam on the brakes in the middle of the open highway screaming at my mother that he’d let a tractor trailer plow into our car and kill us all. Good times.",

I was bullied at the time by almost the entire class and my friends that i had in school, had to redo classes or change schools, so my daily school life was rather lonely. Main Reason for this was me being bad at sports for having a childhood lung disease. \n\nAnyways, one day we had Sport and we played a team game. I, as usual, failed horribly and had a bad time. My team, with me as a handicap, wasn't happy at all. One of the kids in my team tho really took this to heart.\n\nAfter Sport i usually never showered in school due to fear and i always waited a very long time before changing so that i can do it alone. Once i was done and i entered the walkway to outdoors, that one guy who was seriously pissed at our team losing was waiting there. I was scared shitless already but so far nothing all too serious happened if it comes to, you know, physical abuse. So i kinda just thought to myself just stomach the insults and move on. But on this day he had none of it. When i got close he started screaming at me, grabbed me with 2 hands and started choking me. I dont remember much from this point personally but apparently when another mom came in to grab her childs stuff she saw me barely holding on to my consciousness while this guy was strangling me with his hands. Whether it actually was as serious or not, i cant tell as this part is a huge blank in my own memory and i only know what that woman said. The only thing i remember was being in the hospital for a few days afterwards and then coming home.\n\n\nI later learned that my mom threw a massive fit on a meeting between parents and teachers, but the school rode it off as an unavoidable accident.

However this kid could also be charming and funny. Once you got to know him it was easy to see he was deeply insecure and trying very hard to fit in. \n\nI never found out what the trigger was, but one day he poured antifreeze in his dad and step mom's drinks then attempted to hang himself in his room. Luckily everyone survived, however he was sent away after that to work with an \"uncle\" out of state. \n\nThe following year I had another 13 year old boy with very similar behaviors who found his dad's gun and was showing it to a friend (a 14 year old girl.)

My student was arrested but allowed to return home with an ankle monitor (which he was very proud to show off at school.)

So the experienced ones quit for private jobs, and are replaced by green recruits who lack decent training due to the more experienced staff leaving and lack of good leadership. Staffing becomes a revolving door. The few cops left have way too much area to cover by themselves and the prosecutors have no idea what they are doing.

His best friend and co-worker (who I eventually became best friends with too) was a few years older than him. (I was 17, boyfriend was 19, best friend was 25) My fiance would sometimes disapear for a day to three days, saying that he was helping his best friend move stuff for his dad. It happened rather frequently. \n\nOne night a few months later he was supposed to go with our bf to help him collect $$ for a stereo that he had sold and not got paid for. Our friend called, and acting real weird on the phone, told him not to come. That whatever happened, he was supposed to stay with me... The next day they had work and bf never showed. The day after that, we had a cop, a sheriff, and an FBI agent show up at our house to tell us that there was a missing persons report filed on him.  They questioned my fiance pretty hard, and I was VERY confused. Later that night we found out on the news that he had been murdered and his body dumped. \n\nLong story a little shorter, I found out that best friend and my fiance had been dealing meth. Best friend was dealing, and fiance was helping collect the $$. The FBI showed back up at my house and took my fiance for a few hours to question him again. While they were gone, the Sheriff told me I wasn't allowed to go to school for at least the next two weeks. Would not tell me why... When everything was over, and they caught the 2 guys that murdered our best friend, I finally found out why. The guys that murdered him KNEW us, they KNEW that my fiance was supposed to be there that night, and they were going to kill him too. (One of them had actually been at my house the night before, one I had known for years!)  When he wasn't there, they planned on finding him and finishing the job. The FBI found a notebook, left in our best friends truck on accident, that had MY school schedule, work schedule, the route I took to and from school, work and home. They had it all planned out that if they couldn't get their hands on my fiance, they were going to grab me, and use me as leverage to either get him to show up, or murder me as punishment. \nOf course I found this all out AFTER the fact...\n\nEDIT TO ADD: The two were charged with first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole. One was 18 when he went in, the other was 20.\nOne more edit to clarify: re-reading this I realized in my hurry to write it out, I didn't explain part of it completely and it was kind of confusing... In murdering my best friend, the two guys ran over him multiple times with his own vehicle. (After they had beat him severely with a golf club, hitting him SO hard they broke it.) AFTER they ran him over the last time, and left him for dead, they drove off in his vehicle and drove it to the reservoir to dump it there, driving it half way into the water. THAT is how their notebook was found in his truck. In re-reading it, I realized it sounded like my friend was in on the murder plot, and he IN NO WAY was!!",

He left her there and drove her car to an apartment complex, then walked to another place, where the other girl picked him up and helped him with an alibi. Our friend didn't know her throat had been cut, and walked over  a quarter of a mile to a home, where she found someone to call 911. They said if she had known her throat was cut, the panic would have caused her heart to beat faster, and she would have bled out quickly and died. Being so calm is what saved her life. She had a 5 year old son at the time, who thankfully was not with her when the attack occurred. She had been with this guy for 2 years and she says he never showed any violent tendencies. He liked having control, and didn't like her taking that from him by taking to the other woman. He was convicted and sentenced to 30 years, and is still in jail (he'll probably be out in another year or two though) The other girl was charged with accessory after the fact, but I don't know what happened with that.",

We knew that there was a couple living there with two small children and it sounded like they were screaming for their lives, few second later another extremely loud bang was heard, and screaming continued - since their apartment was right above we also knew that it had the exact same layout and I could hear the path that the girls screaming took, and the bangs continued after them like clockwork, 8 times or something, I can't remember exactly anymore, but it was all over in less than 30 seconds, and the only noise was some grunting. I managed to reach the police pretty much exactly when it stopped and I said what I wrote earlier, it sounds like someone is banging a sledgehammer on the floor in the apartment above, but fortunately I also mentioned that 'it could be gun fire'.\n\nNever in my life have I experienced even in movies, the police showing up so god damn quickly, they were there in just a few minutes, but unfortunately it took them over 5 minutes to get into the apartment, all the locks including dead bolts were locked and it was a steel door, \"security door\" of sorts. When the cops finally got the door open I could hear one of them cry out \"NOOO!!!\", it was horrible.\n\nMe and my friend were certain that the girls had been killed.\n\nAfter a while my friend had to go to her daughters daycare to pick her up, and we managed to get out just before the police closed off the whole apartment block, and I then walked to some cops doing the closing off and told them I had been the one to call. And one officer put me in his patrol car and started taking my statement, and he told me there had been a triple murder/suicide, the husband had shot his wife and his mother-in-law and then himself, and they were all dead when the police came in the door - but the children survived thank god because they were at daycare.

It turned out that I had strep throat. So they're typing out my discharge paperwork and my mother approached the desk where the nurse was sitting. Clearly stinking of alcohol, the nurse told my mother that she wouldn't be allowed to drive me home because she was clearly intoxicated. This sent my mother into a drunken rage, swearing and threatening the nurse. Who told her if she left the police would be called. My mother grabbed me and hurries me into the car. I start yelling at her about how irresponsible she is and how she is ruining her life with alcohol. This pisses her off even more. We only live less than a mile away but my mother has taken a different route than normal, when I ask why she just says it's the long way and she doesn't want to get caught. As we're traveling down this dark, Maine back road she begins speeding like crazy. We were doing at least 90 mph when she looks over at me with a blank face and says I'm sorry. She then pulled the E brake and cut the wheel sending us flying off the road. The next thing I remember is sitting in the front seat of a pickup truck with an EMT shining a flashlight in my eyes along who the president was. I responded that Bill Clinton was the president (2000). Apparently she had crashed us into a huge rock at the end of someone's property, directly on my side of the car. Apparently I crawled over her and staggered to the door of the property to ask for help. They put us in different ambulance and we headed back to the hospital we just left. Upon arrival, the nurse my mother fought with said \"I knew you'd be back\". My mother in a drunken semi conscious state kept saying I'm sorry I tried to kill you, I love you, over and over. She suffered several broken ribs, a broken collar bone, broken nose and cracked vertebrae. I had a concussion and some cuts on my face from the door window basically exploding on impact with the rock. She was sentenced to some alcohol program through the courts and some community service. She suffered severe depression and six months after this she took her own life in another car accident. She actually asked me if I wanted to go for a ride with her that night and I told her no, I'll see you when you get home. That was the last thing I ever said to her.",

In the state where we were living, children in those types of custody arrangements can choose to live with one parent full time when they turn 14, and I obviously decided to live with my mother. This enraged him and he kept trying to lure me over to his house. \n\nDespite the fact that I was terrified of him my mom decided that I needed to go over for his infant son's birthday party and to 'make peace' with him (spoiler alert my mom is also crazy). On the way back from the party he started berating me for 'leaving him' and 'being ungrateful'. He was swerving all over the road to  scare me and then reached over, unbuckled my seatbelt, opened the passenger side door, and tried to shove me out it. Thankfully I managed to grab the seatbelt and it locked, and I grabbed some part of the interior with my other free hand. We struggled for a couple minutes and I managed to distract him by kicking at the steering wheel, which gave me enough time to pull myself back into the car. We were almost to my mom's house by then and he started to slow down so I bailed and ran into the house. He came after me as soon as he had parked, but my stepdad made him leave. \n\nA month or so later my mom made me go back \\*again\\* because 'I had really upset him' and I 'owed him an apology'. When I walked in his wife told me that he was down in the basement and my stomach sank. I should have just turned right around, but you know, gaslighting and all that. As soon as I got down the stairs he shoved me into the middle of the room and sat down on the stairs with a rifle pointed at me. He told me that one way or the other, I wasn't leaving his house. There was a phone on the wall over his computer desk on my left and I ran for it. He started screaming at me and stood up to aim and I pivoted and ran at him as fast as I could. I knocked the barrel of the gun away with my arm and threw all of my weight into his side, knocking him over. I don't even remember my feet touching the stairs and I still have nightmares where I'm running down the driveway. My mom was waiting at the end of the driveway and I screamed at her to start driving (which pissed her off) but when she saw him run out of the house with the gun she got us the fuck out. We never spoke about it aside from her telling me to calm down and stop crying.\n\nI have chronic severe ptsd from the whole thing (including the abuse leading up to the attempted murders and my mother's inability to respond appropriately). It's still hard for me to sit in the passenger seat with a male driver, and I panic when men get between me and an exit. I'm still in therapy but I've made a really good life for myself.\n\nTL:DR When I was 14 my mom's ex husband tried to throw me out of a moving car and then later tried to trap me in a basement and shoot me.

As my sister stood in the doorway waiting for the rain to stop and finally relieved there was no more likelihood of seeing him again after that day and the fact he was being agreeable, he suddenly came up behind her and hit her over the head with a brick. When she came round he was sat astrid her with both hands on her throat and began to squeeze. She tried to fight him off but eventually she began to lose consciousness and she thought (this upset me so much when she told me) ‘so this is how I die and I’m never going to live to my 25th birthday’. I think he panicked or assumed he had killed her and he ran off. She was found by some people and rushed to hospital. When I saw her after she got back from hospital and the police station, I wept at the sight of her, she had no whites to her eyes, just burst blood vessels and her throat was bruising up and she couldn’t speak. All he got was 4 years. The legal system is so odd in the UK that when she was trying to move to the USA, she had to ask his permission to take their daughter with her, when the courts tried to find him, he was serving another 6 years for robbery and assault.

He walks outside to see if he can see who has taken it, turns to look towards the road which was up an embankment, and sees two youngish kids (about the same age as my brother and I at the time) trying to pull this heavy fire extinguisher up the hill.  My dad then walks up to them and calls for them to just drop the extinguisher and to leave, but as he does, the older of the two kids puts his hand down his trousers' waist band and pulls out a hand gun, chambers a round and points it at my dad and then tried to fire the gun.  It was only because the gun failed to fire that my dad is still with us as as soon as he saw the gun come out he dived for cover behind a concrete pillar.

It was late on a Friday afternoon, and I was walking from a frat house I had been drinking at to a bus stop to get to my dorm. (I’m a guy). My plan was to go back to the dorm, grab dinner, shower/change, and then hit the bars (this was a college town in the NE were a crappy chalked license could get you into half a dozen bars as long as your looked at least 17).\n\nI’m walking down a fairly busy street, about a half mile or so to the bus stop. I’m sort of buzzed, but in complete control. It was warm (at least low 70s) and still really light out. A pickup truck pulls alongside me and the driver (a guy who looked like he was in his early 20s or so) gives me a really friendly “hey!” I didn’t recognize him, but I had met literally hundreds of new people the last few weeks, so I figured it was a guy I had met somewhere along the way. I lean into the passenger side window and say hi, and we start making small talk. He asks me where I’m going, I tell him I’m going back to my dorm. He says something like “you’re going in this early?” I tell him no, I’m just going to grab dinner and change. He says “hop in, I’ll give you a ride.” I tell him not to worry about it (at this point I’m thinking nothing other than “wow, this is a friendly guy”). I tell him the bus stop is only a half mile away or something. He says “come on, the weather is crappy, I’ll drive you there…” I point out that it is sunny and 70 degrees. He says “come on, it’ll be faster…” (at this point I’m still so oblivious, I’m thinking nothing of it. I again say (very nicely) “nah, don’t worry about it.” Suddenly is demeanor immediately changes, he glares at me, and he says “get in the f$cking truck, NOW.” Maybe it was because I was a bit buzzed, but instead of being scared, for some reason i thought it was the funniest thing, I though the guy was just screwing around with me, so I just start screaming shit like “F$CK YOU! You f$cking homo!” (This was the 90s when it was still considered normal for teenaged guys to use homophobic remarks). I halfway expected the guy to start laughing, but he suddenly gets his look on his face and he takes off like a bat out of hell.\n\nI continue walking to the bus stop, and I’m laughing to myself about that crazy dude, thinking stuff like “that dude was hilarious! I wish I remembered his name, hopefully I’ll run into him again and we’ll hang out…” I get back to my dorm and tell my roommate, halfway through it dawns on me that I’m lucky not to be facedown a ditch right now with my pants torn off…",

I was between 11 and 13 (I don’t remember the exact age), my uncle lured me into his work garage.  He had a home business and he had machinery in a big barn.  He told me he wanted to show me something and to come with him.  I remember having an uneasy feeling.   But I reluctantly followed him anyway.  He was an adult and I was a child and I was taught to do what adults say.  I wish I had said no and had listened to my gut.  \n\nOnce in his work garage, he pinned me against the wall and put a knife to my neck.  He said, “You are not going to get away this time.”  I thought of trying to fight back.  But then I thought, “he will kill me for sure and if I die, there will be no one to protect my sisters.  Oddly, I remember my focus always being on protecting other people, rather then on my own well-being.  I was the oldest of my two sisters.  On multiple occasions I put myself in harms way to protect my middle sister and sometimes even sacrificed myself so he would leave her alone.  I was his favorite victim.  \n\nHe much bigger then me.  I was always very tiny for my age and I did not think that I could fight him off with him having a knife.  So he pointed the knife to my neck and forced me to lay on the ground.  I was terrified and as I was lying down, I felt myself losing consciousness.  When I woke up I was laying on the garage by myself with no pants on.  I was bleeding from my vagina.  \n\nI still believe that he could have killed me if I had fought back.  When he was drunk he would go into a rage and he seemed to have no self control.  I could have seen him panicking and murdering me if he really thought that I was going to talk.  He also was very reckless and seemed to get a thrill out of taking risks.  For example, on multiple occasions he physically and sexually assaulted my sister and me in broad daylight outside his house.  He lived in out in the country, but still.",

He was convinced that I was cheating on him. I did everything I could to make sure that I could give him some closure with the issue, like let him track my phone and go through it anytime he wanted. He would show up at my work unexpectedly to just try and catch me in the act. He went as far as to place a recording device in my car. I wasn’t cheating on him and there was nothing I could do ease his mind. After the recording device incident he had made a plan to kill me. He took me out into the middle of nowhere on BLM land. The only reason I agreed to go is because we had talked about going for a walk earlier that day to be alone and talk in depth about our relationship and what we could do to fix it. So we get to the destination, we walk around a bit and found a spot to put up a hammock and relax. About 5 minutes into the conversation he tells me he has proof that I’ve been cheating and pulls up the recording from earlier that day that he had secretly stashed in my car. He is dead set that he could hear me jacking of another man and that I’m moaning in it. None of this happened at all. I could hear my music and me dropping off my kids at the grandparents house that is 2 minutes from my work, and then I could hear me talking to grandpa and heading to work, that’s it. But he heard something different. I swore on my life I wasn’t cheating and that I loved him and wanted only him. He stood up from the hammock and called me a liar, I was so fed up with the accusations I said I was leaving. I went for my keys and he grabbed them first. He said I wasn’t going anywhere. He backed down the hill a little ways and uncovered an Ak47 he had stashed under a black towel and placed a bunch of shrubbery on top of it. He had picked this spot earlier that day and had it all planned out. He picked it up and aimed at me. I’ve never in my life felt so scared and in disbelief that this was happening to me. He said that I could scream all I want that no one would hear me, that I need to confess to everything that I’ve been doing and that we were going to die together. I pleaded and begged for 4 hrs. For my life and even though he had put me through this I begged for his life also. I could imagine my 2 kids just heart broken, my daughters father had committed suicide back in October of that year and she would’ve been orphaned. He screamed and yelled at me the whole time, while pointing the gun at me. I really truly thought this is where I was going to die. He told me his higher power said he needed to do this. I really don’t know what convinced him to let me go but he threw my keys at me, told me to leave and that he was going to go back up the hill sit in the hammock listen to the recording and blow his brains out. I loved that man more than anything, the last 4 years with him were the best time of my life and I truly believe we were soulmates and that we’d be married one day. Man... I loved him with all I had... I somehow convinced him to come with me to go get a hotel and talk. He said he was wrong and he didn’t hear what he thought he heard on the recording. We left. I took the guns he had and locked them up where he couldn’t get to them. And I’m so stupid for thinking he had a clear mind after all of that, that the next day while at home he started back up with the accusations. I flipped out took all his things and threw them outside, I told him to leave and he did. 2 months go by and no word from him. He finally reached out and I find out he’s in Ecuador. He apologizes and because I lived that man so much we talked about fixing things. The next thing I know I’m getting emails from him with his passport pictures, pictures of where he is social security numbers, and a statement saying that he loved me. I tried desperately to reach him but he wouldn’t respond to my messages.I didn’t hear from him again. His mom reached out to me about a week later and tells me he had committed suicide. And that he loved me more than life itself. This was in June of this year, I’m struggling so hard but I have to keep going for my kids. That’s the only reason I’m here.",

With any luck you'll break their finger. If not they'll be forced to let you go to avoid having their finger broken and you can escape or get into a better defense position.",

It was a rare rock to me, I had never seen such a beautiful pattern on a rock.  He took it and threw it outside in the rock bed, where it probably lays to this day.  I spent hours searching for it.  My mother left for AA, and my stepdad kept drinking.  30ish minutes after she left, he started SCREAMING from the front door for me to 'get my stupid fucking ass inside'. I was immediately terrified of the tone in his voice, he had never sounded like that before, never cussed at me in such a way. I didnt want to go inside, I hid under his truck.  He found me, grabbed me by my pig tails and dragged me inside.  The moment he had me inside he slammed the door, which hit my arm and scraped several layers of skin off. His giant hand went around my throat and held me against the wall for several seconds.  I couldnt breathe, the sounds I made still ring through my head on occasion.  My older autistic brother came out of his bedroom, excited over something, but the moment he saw what was happening he ran off and was mute for 4 months.  I considered kicking my stepdad in the balls, but even as a 7yr old I knew it would anger him more. I could smell the alcohol mixed with Old Spice oil.  I dont know how long he held me there, but he did let go eventually and let me run to my room.  I heard him slam the door to the garage a few seconds later, which always meant he was off to shamefully drink more vodka.  I stayed in my room, scream-crying, legitimately hoping my neighbors would hear and come rescue me (again).  My mother came home after the AA meeting and ignored my crying for about an hour before she asked my stepdad why Im crying.  \"I dont know, why would I know?\", he had mumbled drunkenly. She came into my room and I told her everything that had happened.  She called him into my room and demanded he apologize.  He did, and he took my in by the shoulder and held me against him in a supposedly loving way, which I hated but my mother let happen.  That was it.  Thats the day I learned apologies are worthless.  My mother didnt leave him over this, she didnt send me off to my grandparents for safety.  She continued to leave me alone with this man for several hours at a time, for several more months, before we finally moved out in the middle of the night (he worked graveyard shift).  He died within the next year from liver failure and brain damage, AKA alcohol poisoning in his case.  He spent his last months calling my mother, me, begging us to come back.  He even got ahold of my other brothers and begged them to ask us to come back, we still dont know how he got their numbers.  He had been drunk since 13, died in his mid forties. When I got my license and car, I spent months sitting in my car in front of the still abandoned house, crying and screaming at this ghost house I once called home.  It took me a very long time to finally let it settle in that his death was not our fault.",

To make matters worse, although I was parked in an uncovered parking, which in most condos is a visitor parking spot, there was a faded number which I could not see because it was nighttime and it was very faded. \n\n\nWhen I returned to my car he had plastered a giant sticker on my driver’s side window, stating that a tow truck has been called. The sticker was huge and would have completely obscured my view out of it. I was a young hot head and I thought he was putting advertising on my window or vandalizing my car so I angrily walked up to him and said, “Hey! What do you think you’re doing!?” He didn’t seem to hear me as he turned from my car and began walking away so I got on my tippy toes and tapped his shoulder (because I’m 5’2” and he was over 6 ft tall). I genuinely thought he simply had not heard me, so it wasn’t an angry push, just a tap-tap to get his attention. No sooner had I done this he turned around and immediately pointed a gun in my face.\n\n\nI was frozen, as I realized a gun was only inches from my face.

Sure enough he seemed to snap out of whatever hatred filled train of thought he was on, because he gave me a smug, half smile, and walked off. \n\nSomeone was sitting on their balcony and yelled down, “My gosh, are you ok? I saw the whole thing.” I felt like I had the wind knocked out of me but I stammered that I was ok. I ran back to my car and began peeling the sticker off my car so I could drive away, I was worried he would come back out. The person who saw what happened called the police and they arrived as I finished peeling off the sticker (it was huge and hard to get off).

She hesitated for a moment like she was about to help me but then looked around and realized everybody was inside. At this point I'm bobbing up and down and only able to gasp for air when I resurface every several seconds. At some point when I bobbed up again in the pool the sliding door was closed and the music had been turned up. \n\nI just kept focusing on trying to breathe but I was getting tired very quickly. It got to the point to where I would sink to the bottom and have to propel myself up to get air. Each time I went down it took a little longer to get back to the surface of the water. I spent too much energy thrashing around and was getting weaker. I didn't have the sense to float on my back or try to scoot closer to the edge of the pool. Despite my initial panic I did become calmer and calmer as I came closer to drowning. \n\nThen, all of the sudden, a young brunette man with wavy long hair scooped me out of the pool. His eyes were so wide and freaked out as he rescued me. I just remember him so clearly. He kept asking me if I was okay and if I could breathe. Wrapped me in a towel and took me inside. Then he screamed at my mother for leaving me by the pool unattended. I think she was forgiven pretty easily for it being an 'accident'.

He’s not mentally stable honestly and neither am I. While I have other siblings my brother and I both never have gotten along and have violent tendencies towards one another, some of this can be explained away with our mental issues. Some is just hatred. Anyways, some of the “attempts” I remember the most include;\n\nI’ve had fights with him that escalated to him holding me on the ground with his hands around my neck and his fingers pressed in to choke me, seeing as I’m larger than him (he’s small for his age and much lighter than me) I was able to overpower him and restrain him into a hold before walking away. \n\nOne of the times a few years ago, he was picking on my youngest sister. I was called by my other younger sister from upstairs to help, so I go up to the youngest sisters room and tell my brother to knock it off, I can’t remember every detail but he starts getting very violent with her, throwing her around and hitting her etc (she’s 4 years younger than him). So basically I interfere and eventually sock him in the face, we fight with our hands for a while and I get him in a restraint for a little while, before he ends up biting my arm. (I still have the scar) Our fight moved down the stairs  to the kitchen and he ends up grabbing the largest kitchen knife we have in the house and thrusting it at me, at this point I’m like, ok shit. Distance is needed. So I scream at my sister to take my other sister into her room and block the door. And they do. Not wanting to put my sisters at risk I run the opposite way of them and all the way down to my room, now. Our doors don’t have locks. So, I was barricading myself in my room with only my body as he pounded on the door and tried to force it open. I remember calling my parents in hysterics because it was escalating that much, back during this time we always fought, but this was the second time he brought in a real knife. My parents ended up getting home and yelling at him. I think he went to the hospital for a night or so than he came home. \n\nThe most recent fight we had was a few months ago just after or before I turned 16. He had hit my littlest sister again and I was yelling at him and he grabbed a stool. It was only plastic I think, can’t remember, and he hit me over the head with it a few times. I ended up pinning him to the ground and just beating on him for a little. \n\nSurprisingly enough we’ve never ended up in the hospital, never called the cops, and never broken anything. I have multiple scars on my body from the fights, and I try not to hurt him too much. Even though I am an asshole to him and am definitely not the victim. So yea, I have more stories but this is already long. \n\nSorry if it doesn’t count\n\n(While I was typing this he walked in to show me a video of some cartoon guy eating a plate of severed dicks at a telepath restaurant, it was fucking hilarious.

            "text": "Back in 1999 when I was 8 years old, we were having a pool party at one of my Cub Scouts friend's house in Tampa. Taller kid, probably 11 or 12, just kept trying to dunk me over and over again. I kept telling him to stop, moved a few feet away, and kept playing noodle-sword fight with my friend. This kid would not break eyes with me, and kept silently following me in a circle around the pool and wouldn't say anything. He finally backed off for a minute after my friend told him to stop, and we got back to playing. Suddenly, I feel someone grab my shoulder, the top of my head, and then dunk me with their full body weight. I figured it was the kid just trying to mess with me again, so I went to jump up, and as my head broke the water, he pushed me right back down again and put his full weight on top of my shoulders. He had his knees on my shoulders and was straight pinning me under while holding my hair and neck with both hands, and would not let me up. I'm flailing my arms trying to punch him from behind, and can feel myself getting dizzy and blacking out, and can barely hear my friend yelling.\n\nSuddenly, I feel the kid slide off my back, and my friend's mom yank me up by my arm. As I come out of the water, I can hear everyone freaking the fuck out. I'm gasping for air, my dad is making a run for this kid, who is now being yanked out of the pool by my friend's dad while his mom keeps smacking my back as I cough up water. All I remember was as I came back up, I locked eyes with this kid and he just had this creepy look in his eyes.\n\nNever saw that kid again after. I don't think my friend even knew him. It was one of the kids of his parents' friend. Kid got taken home immediately after.",

It was the second week back from summer so everyone was in a carefree mood because classes had only just started. We all drank until close and it was one of the drunkest i had been in years, although i still remember every detail. We left and went to walk a friend home two blocks away because a local gang had given him trouble a few nights before. As we get close to his place, what do you know, the same gangbangers are outside (one of them lived in the same apt building). They yell stuff and try to start a fight w our friend to which a few of my other friends didn’t like so they got aggressive back hoping to  scare them off because there was almost double the numbers on our side. Instead one of them threw a beer bottle at my friends head and charged him tackling him. A brawl broke out and one guy on their side got pretty beaten up. I pull my friend off him and break up the fight and tell them to get out of here to which they replied “we will be back, with poles.” I didn’t think anything of it in the moment and just made sure my boys were good then we went to walk home. Me and one other friend split off from our group to walk a different route for some reason and we get like 200 yards away from our house. Then a car comes screeching down the street and pulls up on the side walks in front of us and two of the guys in the car hop out. They cocked their guns and started firing. As soon as i saw the gun all instincts took over and i immediately ran towards my house as fast as possible and i was hearing the shots behind me which made me go even faster. My friend and i both made it thru our door without getting hit and the car screamed away into the night. \nUnfortunately, it didn’t even stop there. A week later, against my better judgement i went out to a different bar. I was there with about 15-20 people though so i felt safe. But, i look outside the bar and there the shooter is holding a fanny pack motioning for me to come outside. I shook my head no and started getting nervous as hell like what am i gonna do. Then, my gf and her friend get kicked out of the bar right then and so everyone starts to leave right then and I’m thinking im screwed so i tell all my friends what’s happening. To my surprise they actually all kind of turtled around me and we hustled towards a safe location but the gangbangers ran towards us and aimed their guns but we all booked it into a mexican restaurant and they called the cops. The shooters waited outside banging on the glass telling me and my roommate to come out and die. They heard sirens and took off and they were never caught even though the police knew their identity. They were even brought in for questioning and made many witnesses pick them out in a photo lineup but then before they could make an arrest they all fled town. \nTo this day I don’t know why they even targeted me because I didnt even throw a punch and I possibly stopped the one from landing in the hospital if I didn’t pull my friend off of him during the first fight. Since then the crime rate in my college town has soared and there has been 5 students shot this past semester from what i hear. Fucked up.",

I've known this girl for about 11 years, I met her through a ex girlfriend but only met up with her a few times over the years. Anyways I got to the apartment and brought a bottle of vodka and some molly. All 3 of us(me, the girl and her friend that is a girl) seemed like we were having a good time, but I started to find out she's part of a street gang but I've been around that type of thing throughout my life but never been apart of one so I thought \"whatever\". Then I find out they do meth and now I'm getting more cautious. My friend's friend leaves out of the apartment for a bit to meet some people and comes back about 45 mins later with a few guys that are apart of the gang and we all are drinking and I'm getting a little more cautious.  The girls go to the washroom with this one guy that seems like the leader and a bit of time goes by so I check up on them and when I knock on the bathroom door the guy opens it up and gets aggressive with me so I leave out of the apartment right away and drive home. Once home i message my \"friend\" and tell her if she wants a way out I can help her. She tells me that they all left and I should come back and just me and her can chill. So against my better judgment I go back and she let's me in and as I'm following her into the living room a guy with a bottle is coming at me from the living room and two guys are coming from behind me and one used a push knife. I tried to bolt for the door immediately but as I opened it a few inches they were able to come quickly and kick it shut and start punching, kicking and stabbing me. After a few minutes of that they stopped and told me strip down and shower off the blood. After I did that I was allowed to put my underwear back on and they told me to sit on a sofa chair in the living room where they intermittently gang beat on mostly my head/face over about 3 hours, taking breaks in between, having secret meetings amongst themselves. They keep telling me \"you know what you did\", I tell them \"I don't know what l did\" \" what did I do that was so bad to deserve this\" \"I have a son\" \"I just want to go be a father\" . They tell me to shut up when I bring up my son. They tell me this is the last beating, that I can go and they give me their word but they keep beating me and that's when I knew I can't trust anything they say. And one of the guys starts walking infront of me waving the push knife in my face and in that moment that's when I knew they were going to kill me. In that moment In my head I said to myself \"it's now or never, I can't let my son not have a father\", I wrapped my hands around the guys had with the knife and charged into him into the opposing wall with the livingroom window. The two other guys started beating on me in panic because I was trying to grab the knife and after the guy with the knife broke free they all stopped for a moment and that when I jumped up with everything I had left and dove head first through the living room window with half my body outside they were trying to pull me back in but I pulled myself out and told them \"to fuck off\" as I broke free in the early morning darkness, I ran to a public bus about 30 feet away that was stopping at a bus stop, while I'm covered in blood and stab eounds, my face swollen up and unrecognizable while just in a pair of boxers. I was banging on the closed bus door but he would not open it, I was very scared at this point, I see he was on the radio probably calling for help, I was so exhausted I laid down on the sidewalk. A few moments later the thought occurred to me that they could come out and finish me off so I ran down the street to the 7-11 and banged on the door but they would not let me in and then laid on the side walk, moments later police arrived and then paramedics. Idk when I started crying but I remember in the ambulance I couldn't stop, I couldn't stop crying and hyper ventilating, I was so scared, I don't know how to describe it better than that. This is the first time I've written this down and told the whole story and it definitely brings up a lot of emotions.

They sat next to me in the seats and the leader of the 3 pulled out a knife and asked me if I'd ever been stabbed before. He told me he'd been stabbed and that I didn't want to know what it felt like. He said he'd hate to have to hurt the elderly woman there too. He told me I was pretty and that each of them were going to have their way with me in the bathroom. I knew I couldn't escape them and figured my best bet would be to play into it with them to buy time until another bus or staff arrived. So I responded with things like yes I'd like that. He'd keep asking me if I thought he was sexy and I'd respond with everything I thought he'd want to hear, all while he was playing with his knife.

From packing my infected surgery site. To preparing meds to push through my picc line every few hours. \n\nI now have permanent plate that stretches from center chin to the end of the jaw. It has caused partial paralysis in my chin and lips. Most of my teeth were cracked, chipped or lost completely.

Slept on a couch with two cushions that were covered in dog hair and dog piss. It was gross. The shower never worked right. Her husband would keep all the lights on, stay up til 8AM the next morning, and would want me to stay up with him even when I had to go to work at 7AM. It was hell for 2 years. Mainly staying there to get tech experience on my resume working at staples which didn't amount to shit really. Never got me a good job anywhere else. Was ultimately a waste.\n\nAnyway 5AM he's drunk and he's been telling me all night in his passed out stupor for me to get my shit and get out and I drive him home and we go inside, pitch black dark, he goes back to his bed and I'm about to go to bed too, still fully clothed.\n\nHe said \"I want you to get your shit and get the fuck out in the morning\" and I said \"Alright... fuck it\" well he thought I said \"Fuck You\" and didn't give me any time to explain and next thing you know I hear \"ADAM NO\" and I knew somehow that he was fully alert and coming to kill me. Sure enough I bolt out the door, he's right behind me I get in the car, crank it, he has his gun ready to shoot me, and I fly the fuck outa there before he can rip my door open and clip me.\n\nMy sister took his side saying he did nothing wrong of course because fuck her. She's been trying to become close again ever since and I'm just avoiding her and she wont get rid of him. He's just a dickhead pill addict who lays in the bed all day and does nothing for himself. She's his maid, servant, etc. Everything but she chose him over me that day and that was it.\n\nShe knows I hate him and I've mad it clear because she's tried multiple times to get me to come down there to see them acting like that never happened 10 years ago. She also had another incident where him and my other \"brother in law\" (step sister; she's not married, but it's her fiance or some shit) got in a fist fight Christmas Eve a few years ago and she to this day still claims her husband did nothing wrong and was punched for no reason and all this bullshit when I saw it myself that he was running his mouth saying \"fuck are you gonna do about it motherfucker\" and then the fight broke out. He lost.\n\nStep sister's BF isn't much. He's a pothead, mooches off my dad's kindness, same as her, just scummy BUT he did punch Adam so he gets that 1 point of respect from me for woopin Adam's ass when nobody else would. Fucked up thing is back then I wasn't afraid of anything except getting shot. Wasn't afraid to walk outside at 2AM going to the store in the most dangerous place in the state. The detroit of NC. Also I'm white... so. Yeah. \n\nBut now I can be sitting in the dark, fully safe, not a damn thing going on and I've been having anxiety attacks and chest pains the doctor says are just anxiety. So basically the reason I was never afraid of anything was i bottled it up and now I can't get rid of it... so that's fun. Thanks adam for contributing to that you fat prick.\n\nTLDR; Sister's husband tried to kill me for a misunderstand because he's a drunk and she took his side.",

My moms side of the family all have severe mental illness- she’s got schizophrenia but my grandmother and uncle both are undiagnosed. Based on the way this illness is inherited and the way they behave, they likely have the same. \n\nI was graduating from high school. Still trying so hard to have a relationship with my mom. I had told her that she could not bring her family to my graduation since we had had stalking incidents with them in the past. \n\nWell, she brought her family anyway. My sister ran into our aunt and cousins in a hallway at the venue. Apparently my cousin gave her such an intense, knowing warning look that she knew something bad was going to happen. I had no way of knowing any of this as they forbid us from having any cell phones at all in our robes. \n\nAfter the graduation happened, we were all directed to walk together as a group to the front of the venue outside for pictures. We were walking, and I suddenly got this incredibly strong feeling and urge to run into an alley and find my dad. It was really weird because I had no real reason to feel uneasy. But I listened to the urge, and to my surprise the alley let out into the parking lot where my family was waiting. \n\nI was then informed that my mom’s whole extended family had showed up, several adults in the family had been smirking at my dad, and we knew something was happening but not what. I got the hell out of there and had to tearfully tell my mom that since she had broken her promise not to bring her family, I wouldn’t see her after. \n\nThen later I found out from my friends that my uncle had been circling through the crowds, outside. Hands in his pockets holding what seemed to be a gun. Asking for me. Asking where I was. Laughing like a psycho. \n\nAnd if I had followed directions and joined the rest of the class for a group photo I’d likely be dead right now.\n\nI guess it’s not exactly a murder attempt since he never got to me- but the intent was certainly there.

Paste? I never found out what it was. He walked over and shoved his face into mine and whispered: \"I saw you.\" as I was trying to lock my gate. I asked him what he meant and he started screaming: \"It was you! I saw you in the red car! Your following me! Spying on me!\" and he ran back to his house yelling that he was calling the cops. Concerned something might be very wrong I also called the cops and told them what happened. They told me they would come over and check too see if he was okay.  And btw; I owned and drove a black car at the time.\n\nDay Two: I wake up and look out my kitchen window and see said neighbor installing security camera's on his house, all pointed directly at my house. Mildly concerning, but sure. Go about my business the rest of the day without worrying much. Day ends, turn in for the night at 11pm. Wake up shortly later to the sound of a chainsaw running! Neighbor is using a chainsaw to cut SOMETHING in his house at nearly midnight. Call the cops immediately. Very worried, say they are on they're way. I can hear him start screaming something next door, so I take out my phone and start recording the best I can in pitch black darkness. Cops show up and the noise stops briefly before He starts screaming that AT THIS VERY MOMENT I'am trespassing on his property trying to break into his house and he is preparing to defend himself. No. I'am not. I'm on the phone with the cops, in my house, watching this go down. Cops calm him down and they leave.\n\nDay Three: 3am, just a few short hours after the previous incident I wake up to a blood curdling scream from my neighbors house. Shrill, loud, shrieking. Uncontrollable and unintelligible. Consider calling the cops again, but immediately fall asleep before I could reach the phone beside my bed. Wake up again at 5am to him screaming again, but this time I can make out what he's saying. He is screaming at the top of his lounges \"YOU RAPED ME! YOU RAPED ME BUT DIDN'T KILL ME! WHY DIDN'T YOU KILL ME YOU DEVIL!\" - immediately followed by gunshots. Gunshots that are very clearly hitting the walls of my house! I roll out of bed and call the cops one more time. They say they are dispatching more units and to stay hidden till they can contain the situation but be prepared to flee my house if he advances on me. I hide in the bathroom as he shoots out my windows while waiting for the cops. He continues shooting at my house for several minutes without stop. Screaming nonsense between shots. Fearing the worst I grab my gun and crawl to the back door and barricade it with my dryer. crawl to the front door and take aim at the door. If he's getting in, this is the only way and i'am not letting that happen.\n\nCops finally arrive like 20 or 30 minutes into the shoot out and he does not stop, Instead he is now throwing make shift fire bombs at my house! Glass bottles filled with something that he is attempting to set on fire. Thankfully they don't do more than singe my lawn before going out. Cops have arrived in full force and surround his house and some run into mine to make sure i'm okay. The cops circle his house and tell him to drop his weapons, as he is still shooting through my windows and destroying my car now! The cops in my house pull out a little map of the area and ask me how best they could sneak into his yard unseen OR evac me without getting in his line of fire. I tell them they could probably jump his backyard fence to get in but all my doors face his line of fire so I'm trapped. They agree and take up positions near the door and wait.\n\n7 Hours pass. He continues shooting and throwing incendiary's for 7 hours. The cops are unable to advance on his house without getting in his line of fire. I just lay on the floor with my protectors and wait it out.\n\nHour 8: The cops with me look out the window when they hear a louder noise and him begin screaming anew. I'am informed that he is standing on his porch, naked, holding two machete's. I can hear him clearly yell \"KILL ME!\" over and over again, I peak out the window as he runs at the cops.\n\nThey take him down with a taser and a dozen cops jump on him and shackle him with some crazy contraption. It looks like he's hog tied with steel chains and they drag him off kicking and screaming. I spend the next couple days dealing with the cops and them making absolutely sure I didn't do the things he claimed I did. Cops search his house and find several unregistered fire arms and the entire house and his furniture has been cut up, with the chainsaw, and made into make shift wooden crosses to cover the entire inside of the house. They also find a man living in his garage. On further questioning on why he was there he reveals he is a homeless man he let stay with him, and they became lovers recently. He was escorted off the property because he apparently had nothing to do with the incident... \n\nMy neighbor is now serving a life sentence at a mental hospital. I was assured by law enforcement that He will never be allowed to leave there under any condition. I moved shortly after to make sure he could never find me and sold my demolished car.\n\nMay he never walk free again.",

The first time, I was in the kitchen with my middle brother, doing chores, and I had back-talked to my step-dad. Something along the lines of \"if I'm not doing the dishes right, you do them.\"\n\nI was about 11 or 12, my middle brother was 8. My step-dad pinned me against the wall, his hand and arm around against throat and holding me up so that my feet were off the ground. He was yelling, but mostly I remember looking over at my brother and seeing his face. He was terrified and screaming at my dad to stop. He stopped only when I stopped fighting and trying to breathe.\n\nAfter that, things cooled down, but he followed me to my room after I was done with the dishes. He tried to strangle me again, I was lying in bed and he was on top of me, crushing me with both hands. This time was because I had apparently acted out in front of my brother, who should not have had to see the display downstairs, and it was all my fault that my brother was traumatized, and how dare I be so bad that I need to be choked like this, etc cetera.

We were toxic for each other. We fought constantly, would break up and get back together. It wasn’t always bad. He wasn’t always a bad kid. He was so smart and caring and I literally had a front row seat to watch as he slowly melted into mental illness. \n\nOn that night we were out and he was driving. I don’t remember where we had been and I don’t remember what we were fighting about but we were screaming at each other. He told me at one point if he was going to die, so was I and he started speeding and driving on the wrong side of a curvy back road with his headlights off on a moonless night. Somehow we didn’t crash into anything or anyone and made it to his mothers house where my car was parked on the street. He pulled up and parked behind my car and then he pulled a knife and held it to my neck. I couldn’t scream. I was in shock. I didn’t do anything. I remember starting at my car with my hand on the door handle just looking at my car. I wasn’t even crying at that point. I don’t remember if he was talking or yelling or if he was saying  anything at all. I remember a ringing in my ears. It felt like ages but it was probably only a few seconds. Then in a snap my boyfriend took the knife off my neck and exclaimed “what am I doing” and threw the knife at the floor boards, it bounced and hit my feet. I slid it to the passenger door and put my foot on it while opening the door and stumbling out. I don’t remember driving home to my parents. \n\nI don’t remember how long after, days, could have been a week, but he showed up at my house in the middle of the night begging to let him in and let him sleep. People were after him and he just needed to sleep. I snuck him in through my window and told him he needed to leave before my mom woke up. He kept chanting about cars following him (I’ve seen that red car before, 4 yellow cars, 3 red cards, all the same cars) he fell asleep and left out the window before my parents woke up. I found out months later that he had been put in a hospital when he called me from it. \n\nI found out years later from one of his old friends that my ex had kidnapped one of their mutual friends that didn’t live around us, took him for a wild ride down the highway shouting nonsense and saying he was going to kill the friend. He eventually dropped off the friend on the side of the highway and left him there (this was right when cellphones started being around and defiantly didn’t have service everywhere and not everyone had one) somehow the mutual friend got someone to pick him up and take him home. The old friend then apologized for how he had treated me when we were together and that I wasn’t the crazy bitch my ex made me out to be. \n\nHe had tried to contact me in the early days of Facebook but the spam filter at the time sent them to where non friends messaged went. He apologized and said he was in a sober home and he was diagnosed and on meds. He apologized for what happened and it was at that point that I finally believed that it did happen and it wasn’t in my head. I never wrote back and I saw him once in a store but I hid until he left. \n\nLast year COVID isolation was too much for him and he killed himself. I’m glad he didn’t take anyone with him.",

            "text": "I would be going too far to say I was nearly murdered without the situation having progressed but this is a scary one that I’ll remember forever.\n\nTwo years ago on thanksgiving, I had just driven to a whole foods to pickup some pre-dinner snacks for everyone. Its a fairly nice, low crime area. On my way out I was approached by this young Muslim girl, no older than 13. She told me that her family needed help since they were locked out of their car around the corner and didn’t have their phones. Not one of them…. I immediately had this off feeling from the way I was approached but brushed it off as anxiety since I was t-minus an hour from introducing my family to my girl. So I end up agreeing to pulling my car around and see what’s up. Let me tell you, I’ve never traveled such a short distance and felt this drastically unsafe from it. Mind you I went all of 30 seconds from where I was parked in front of whole foods over this tiny bridge that connected a separate underdeveloped but otherwise open lot. \n\nTheir minivan was oddly parked in this little clearing directly to the left of this bridge out of sight from anyone in the other lot. It was around 4:30-5:30pm so there was plenty of light out. The SECOND I pull up I could tell something was wrong. This mother and her three kids all quickly come up to my car window which I didn’t even feel safe putting down the whole way and practically begging me get out of my car to help them get in their car. They told me this sob story about how they’re just trying to get home with their groceries for thanksgiving. They had maybe 5-6 Whole Foods bags spread out standing up right, but I could tell from the angle I was viewing that these bags were NOT filled. The clearing they were in was laid in gravel/stone. The way the bags moved in the light breeze made it seem like there was something inside holding them down but just at the very bottom of the bags.. I made it clear in the nicest way possible I had no tools or anything else that could possibly help them get into a locked car but kept offering to call someone for them which they declined. The entire time they had their hands on my window ledge, over the glass threshold. What really scared me me was this woman’s son, a boy of 13-15 years old at most. Throughout the encounter he has this terrifying look in his eyes, like I was prey. If it weren’t for him I most likely would’ve been stupid enough to get out but all things considered I was lucky enough to have gotten myself out of there before anything happened. Even as I said I had to go and slowly let my foot off the brake, the boy held on and took a couple steps with my car as if he wasn’t going to let go.\n\nThe whole experience left me in such fear that I was - and still am - convinced I was one wrong move away from robbery/kidnapping/death. It was so bad I actually went out of my way to dial up 911 and let them know. I explained what happened and that I was most likely just paranoid but to send someone out to see what’s up and help them if they really needed it.\n\nNow this is the part where I had my suspicions confirmed that something was deeply wrong. No more than 20 minutes later after the cops had finally already arrived to check everything out, I got a call from a man that was with them. He immediately got angry and starting cursing me in Arabic and implying I’d regret calling the police. Mind you, he never showed himself to me during the encounter and I was told by the rest of their family that they were the only ones there. On top of that, it means they had phones too. I’m just glad I didn’t stick around to find out what would’ve happened. I really think I would’ve died that day\n\nTL;DR - approached by girl asking to help her family. “Locked” car tucked away from anyone in sight. They lied about multiple things to try and lure me out of my car. I deflected it all and was later threatened on the phone afterwards by another who hid and was not mentioned to me during the encounter. Got my number from police who I called.",

I remember just waking up and seeing my neighbor’s brother standing in the doorway.\n\nHe raped my sister and I repeatedly for what felt like hours, then started to strangle me when he suddenly stopped, then rose up like he heard something and opened the bedroom door. \n\nOur babysitter stood there in the doorway all groggy. He was my mom’s coworker who was a big guy and he said something along the lines of, “[guy’s name] is that you? What are you doing here?” (he knew him too because my neighbor worked with my mom and him). He looked over at my sister and I, probably realized what was going on, then hooked his arm around his neck and started dragging him down the stairs. Before leaving the room though, my assailant said to not tell anyone or he’ll kill us, but in Spanish so only we could understand.\n\nSo my sister and I kept it a secret for years. That babysitter never told my mother about the incident, and he never came back to check on us that night. I have no clue what he did after dragging him away. \n\nAll I know is when we finally told someone what happened and they tracked the guy down, brought him to court etc. that our babysitter refused to be a witness even though he was the only one. I’m glad he showed up when he did of course because he saved our lives but I feel some resentment and confusion to this day as to why he refused to testify. Could’ve put the fucker away for a lot longer than what he got…",

They got a kid which is now 7 years old.\nI knew her for some time, but really met her the first time at a birthday party of a common friend. For some reason her current situation became talk of the evening at the dinner table. She was living with her now ex boyfriend in the same apartment, because he was without a job and could not afford an apartment on his own. Also they live in Munich which has unbelievable high rents. For that reason and because her daughter urged her not to throw him out of the house he could stay, even though it was completly fucked up situation for everyone.\nShe described that he got drunk on a regular basis and recently he got physical with her, pushing her, loud arguments, etc. Main reason was that she got after 2 years started daiting a new guy.\nShe tried to argue with him that it‘s not his buisness at all and he should leave now. Which he didn‘t.\nAnyway, we told her that we would help her if she needs some strong man to take care of him. She was in tears by now with her story.\nAnyway, two days later my wife got a call from her, asking if I and two of my friends who were also at the party could come to Munich and help him move. She found an apartment for him - which she paid six months in advance for him outside the city. He threatened her life at this point.\nSo we arrived the same night in Munich and found a fucked up situation. She tried to pack his stuff into boxes and he hit her with his fist in her face. Her girl was gladly at her moms house a couple of hundred kilometres away. She was in one room and he was raging through the house like a tiger. As we arrived he launched at us, cussed and what not. I couldn‘t understand him, as he was talking in Spanish with a pretty accent. We tried to calm him and boy was he pissed that we were in the house. So our friend came out of her room to appease hin and that‘s when he took a kitchen knife. Like a bread knife and jumped at her. Janked her from behind to the ground and was about to slit her throat. Both my friends who came with me jumped at them and tried to stop him. One of them is a pretty big fella and he managed to smack him a couple of times with his head against his, knocking him out for a couple of seconds.\nI called the police and it felt like they came in seconds. Might be minutes but I was in shock.\n\nHe‘s in jail now, awaiting a trial. District attorney want to trial him on „Tried manslaughter“, which is pretty tough to get. So they might settle for a small prision sentence, on the basis of battery, likely on probation. But he will be deported after. Her attorney told her that she will get full custody of the girl, even if he never gets sentenced. \n\nGrain of salt is, he might not be allowed to re-enter Germany, but he still can travel to any EU country, making it unlikely to enforce it. So my friend will be on the lookout for him for a very long time.",

In my culture, it can be traditional for grandmas and moms to give girls in the families bracelets (usually gold or jade) for good luck. I got my bracelet from my grandma as a baby—I think it was a thin bracelet made of gold, but I’m not totally sure. I remember wearing it constantly, even when I went to sleep.\n\nThere was a girl in my class (preschool) named Rachel who became fixated on my bracelet. She was the “problem child” and bully of the class, always stealing other kids’ toys, pushing them, hitting them, and spitting on them. I remember her demanding (and then begging and whining) for me to give her my bracelet, saying she just wanted to try it on and give it right back, and I remember that being one of my first memories of not believing someone. I told her “no” and I’ll never forget the look of pure, silent anger and malice that she gave me.\n\nFast-forward to nap time, when the teachers turned out all the lights and the kids slept on separate blue mats. I remember going to sleep on my mat, and then waking up to a sharp pain in my neck. I opened my eyes to find Rachel sitting on my chest, her hands wrapped around my throat and squeezing as hard as she could while her nails *gouged* into my skin.\n\nNo idea what happened after that. I just remember waking up and not being able to breathe, and then all of a sudden I was at home and my mom was taking me into the bathroom. I kind of remember thinking it must have been a bad nap time dream, then looking in the mirror and being totally shocked to see my neck covered in bloody gashes and stripes. That and my mom acting really upset clued me in and I remember crying because I thought my neck was going to look like that forever. Being really young + shock just made that whole experience super bizarre, but I’ll never forget how cold and silent she was when she was sitting on my chest, trying to squeeze the breath out of me because I wouldn’t give her my bracelet.\n\nNo idea what happened to her after that; I’ve asked my mom but she didn’t speak English too well at the time and was upset by how that was all handled or something like that, she just gives a vibe like she doesn’t like to talk or think about it.

The bullet is still in my brain, and I had to relearn to walk, but other than that.. I’m doing pretty okay. It happened in October of last year and I went back to work after 2 months because I was depressed and had nothing to do.",

I'm a bit tipsy, English isn't my native language, and this will be long so apologies in advance.\n\nSo, this happened back when we didn't have covid vaccines, the summer of 2020. I'm a uni student and the lockdowns were just beginning in my country (a country where violence towards women make the daily news, usually because of violent men trying to get back at their ex), so I had to move in with my family, who liven a small touristic town. My mom and step-father were going through a divorce back then and with things being they were with the pandemic, he was still kinda living with us but in the process of moving out. I absolutely resent the guy; he's a total douchebag who only really cares about himself. Anyways, they were still in the process and were having ups and downs, but it was mostly downs at that stage. I have a brother by him by the way.\n\nOne day I'm just chilling in front of the PC, and hear his bike's engine coming to a halt outside. I figure whatever, he's probably here to pick stuff up while begging my mother to reconsider her decision. 10 minutes or so pass, and my little brother (11) rushes up the stairs. He tells me that his father showed him a pistol and made him handle it. Now, guns are illegal here or at least you need a license to own one, but my brother swears it was heavy and felt real so I'm mortified. It might've been a fake, but I can't take that risk so I immediately rush to the balcony and I can see them chatting by the bike, so I grab the stave I was working on to make a bow out of, take my knife in hand and sit on the porch, a couple meters away, pretending to scrape away at the stave as I try and listen. He's begging to talk to her somewhere private for 5 minutes about everything, disturbed by my sudden appearance, and my idiot of a mom agrees eventually. When she comes up to get ready I follow, and tell her of what I've learnt. She was stunned at first, but later said he's too much of a coward to do anything. I begged her to tell him off and never speak to him again, but she insisted and went with him.\n\nThe next 30 minutes consisted of me calling her for about 20 times. She didn't pick up most of the time, but she came back eventually. When she did, I called every mutual friend they had and warned them that he had a gun (fake or not) and that if anything happened to my mother and they withheld knowledge, they would be held accountable as I would be reporting this to the police (not that they would do anything, they almost never interrupt domestic violence). In between calls, I cried, screamed, thrashed at the furniture in our garden and destroyed some of it. When I was done calling everyone I just sat there groaning; the fury was so hard to bear I had trouble breathing. If he was there that night and if I'd found the gun, I'd probably kill him in my blind rage. It was that intense.\n\nSo, after all my calls he got rid of the thing the same day. Mom talked me out of calling the cops since she didn't want my brother to experience his older brother and father going to court. I was too exhausted to argue, and later I stopped caring as much for other reasons.\n\nHe never came back after that, he sent some mutual \"friends\" to pick his stuff up. I imagine he knows how things might go down if he shows his face around here. Which is for the best, since I'm not confident in my ability to refrain from punching the crap out of him.",

About six months later he decided to show up at my house and waited for me to get home from the store with a friend. My friend dropped me off and left and my ex came up behind me and said he wanted to talk and wanted to go next door for some privacy. \n\nI was living with my mom at the time and it was dark, but it was fall so it wasn't too late and she was still up. She owned the house next door and used it as a rental, but it was vacant at the time. He walked in first and as I walked through the door he grabbed my throat and slammed me into a wall. I was pretty blind sided and fell to the ground. He got on top of me and started to strangle me, but I put my chin down so he pressed partially on my jaw as well.\n\nI couldn't breathe and I heard a pop sound then I could barely hear. I was trying to reach for a screwdriver that was on the ground to stab him with, but it was too far away to reach. I looked the other way and there was a handle from a large floor jack laying within reach so I grabbed it and hit him as hard as I could in the head twice and he got off of me (it was heavy and had to hurt like hell). I could barely breathe and my jaw and ear hurt really bad, but I managed to get to my knees and try and hit him again. I started to dial 911 and he took of running. \n\nI ended up with mostly muscular damage to my jaw, it still cracks and hurts to have my mouth open really wide or for extended periods of time, like at the dentist, partial hearing loss and some damage to my throat. As if that wasn't bad enough, it gets worse. I went to the hospital in an ambulance and the cops followed for a statement and to take pictures of my injuries. I told them what happened and where he lived and they never did anything about it. He never went to jail or any sort of punishment. He got away with it.",

            "text": "I’m super late to this thread, and spent an hour reading through all the replies before I realized I could respond to this question.\n\nMy brother has always been an abusive piece of shit. He has autism and oppositional defiant disorder and a whole slew of other mental illnesses, so he never received much punishment for his actions. Up until this point, he had hit me more times than I could count, threatened everyone in my family with murder, sexually assaulted me, and kinda just done whatever he wanted for about 14 years. He had half-heartedly grabbed a knife and waved it at people before, but until this night, he never made a true effort to kill anyone.\n\nI was about 13 at the time, and we had just moved into a new house in a new city where they had a high school for kids with severe mental disorders. We thought he was doing better. Him and I fought a lot (especially after the move away from my hometown, which I being a dramatic 13 year old thought was the end of the world) but we hadn’t even fought this particular night. I woke up to him slowly shutting my door behind him, our biggest kitchen knife in his hand. I literally couldn’t make a sound. I opened my mouth to scream, and it felt like my throat had closed up completely.\n\nI somehow managed to stand up, and fought back when he stabbed at me with the knife. I was much weaker than him, and would’ve easily lost that fight, but I think I startled him. He ran out of my room, put the knife back where it was, and climbed back into his bed. After a few minutes, I calmly entered my mom’s room and told her “[Brother] just tried to stab me.”\n\nOf course, once again, he didn’t face any real punishment. The cops weren’t even called; they never were, and on the rare occasion HE called the cops (he liked to claim we abused him), they never did anything. After this incident, he was in a mental hospital for maybe a week. He was in and out of mental hospitals often, but knew how to manipulate the staff to get out. He never learned anything.\n\nMy mom and grandmother (who lived with us to help with my brother, since my dad is also an abusive prick) let him continue living in the same house with me. I never even had a lock on my door until 2-3 years later, and even then, he was 200 pounds and 6’1 by the time he was in high school. A lock wasn’t going to stop him.\n\nHe never tried anything so bold with me again, because I learned how to properly fight back. He kept hitting me, but at least after that I’d hit back. I always got scolded for this, but my brother put me through hell for over a decade, and I was sick of it. He continued to live with us up until last year, when he finally went to jail for a bit. He had chased me, my mom, my grandmother, and one of my friends out of our house with a knife (my parents never bothered to lock them up) and my mom had to grab a hammer to scare him off. He was over 18 now, so the police took him, but he was only in jail for a few days. My parents had immediately spent $5k for a lawyer, who managed to get the charges dropped. Still, they didn’t let him move back in; he stayed in a hotel until they found an apartment for him.\n\nHe technically lives on his own now, but he still comes over to our house whenever he wants. Just the other day he snuck in during the middle of the night and peeked his head into my room; I thought I was going to have a heart attack. He just wanted to pick something up, but still.\n\nI’ll have to see him at Thanksgiving. And I’m sure, as they always do, my parents will request I be nice to him. My extended family will continue to coddle him as well, because he is the golden child of the family, and I only exist at family gatherings to be mocked.",

At around the fourth grade, we got a new principal, who began to target me with humiliation and emotional abuse. One of the major things she would do would be to encourage other kids to go after me, both verbally and physically. This eventually led to a really out of control situation with the students, and any teachers who tried to intervene were immediately shut down by the principal. Several teachers were also involved.\n\nI can't say for sure if they were actually trying to kill me, but when I was twelve years old, three of my classmates went after me in an outdoor swimming pool (really more like a manmade lake), and held me under the water until I'd nearly passed out. I could feel myself beginning to lose consciousness, and I managed to kick one of them hard enough she let me go. I was able to wriggle free and started swimming as hard as I could. I must have passed out at one point, because there's a big gap in my memory after that. When I woke up, I was on the shore, lying on my stomach, so exhausted I couldn't move. I remember trying to move my arm, and all that happened was my fingers twitched.\n\nI was eventually able to get up and just kind of wandered around, catatonic, for the rest of the trip. The principal convinced me that I'd made it up/I deserved it, and it was years before I reconnected with a childhood friend who also remembered the incident. I'm lucky that I told my parents the day it happened, and they believed me. They couldn't get her fired, but she was moved to a new school the next year.\n\nEdited for some minor spelling and clarity issues.",

I only mention race/gender because it’s relevant. I was the only white female working with the people I was, and others thought it was shady and thought I was infringing and taking away from their money (I wasn’t, but I digress). \n\nTo make a long story short, my guys runner (the person who brings the packages/takes the money) was working for a “rival” on the side, unbeknownst to anyone. The rival knew of me, knew I was a user, and asked the runner to give me a sample. (This is common practice for runners to cut throat and attempt to start their own customer base. I assumed at the time that it was a sample from the runner, attempting to get my business). I had no intention of switching sides, but being an addict I obviously accepted the sample. I got home, did it, and immediately overdosed. I got lucky in that I had a friend with me at my house, which was rare because I used alone, and never brought anyone to my house as a rule. If she wasn’t there I would have died. I was able to be revived and spent 2 weeks in intensive care, followed by 3 months in rehab learning to walk, write, etc. \n\nI found out later through different sources that it was a hot bag and I was set up - the rival wanted to take me out. The bag was almost all fentanyl and god knows what else. This was years and years ago, long before fentanyl was what it is now. I got lucky because I had an incredibly high tolerance.

We chatted it up for a while and he commented about always running into people that knew me, there was another person I knew as an acquaintance on the bus so we moved back to talk to her as well. The first guy gets off and her I keep talking. She says she has to walk to meet her boyfriend before we get off and I offer to walk with until she meets him but she declines and we go our separate ways.\n\nI go to the store before headed home and grab some beer. Halfway through my first beer there is a knock at the door. A friend of my roommate, we talked for a bit and he left. Almost done with my beer and another knock, it is him again just asked if he could use the restroom thinking nothing of it I say sure and in flood three more people as soon as the door is opened the rest of the way. One of them the boyfriend of the girl on the bus.\n\nThe first thing said is \"why where you messing with my girl, dawg?\" As two of them opened butterfly knives and I tried to talk them down, I sat there calmly on the couch. They were quite unwilling to listen and I think sitting there calm and just trying to talk passed off at least one of them. The boyfriend is in my face waving his knife but he did not make the first strike, his friend jumps out from behind me and stabs me in the neck(It felt like it went in one side and out the other). I stood up grabbed my throat and said \"fuck I am going to die.\" I ran to my bedroom to get away through the patio door in there. I close one door behind me and I am going for the sliding glass door when there is a crash and a slam against the back of my head. They had kicked the door off it's hinges and it hit me.\n\nThe next thing I remember I swear I am in my living room again but it my have been me stumbling into the hallway again and I see two flashes. They reflected off of the man's glasses, there was an ambient light coming from outside but for a moment there were just those three flashes. \n\nI am suddenly on the floor looking up at the front door, one figure standing there I tell him \"just leave, I'm already dead\" the voice raspy and gurgling. He then asks where my phone is and I say I think it's is my bag. After he grabbed it and was out the door I hear a car squeal out of the parking lot leaving me for dead.\n\nI picked myself up off of my floor and stumbled out the door and started knocking at my neighbor's window and door for help. They looked out and right after the man is out with a towel telling his family to call 911. I have no idea how long it took but they start showing up asking me questions. The usual sort I guess, who and why and I was scared to talk because I thought every time I did even more blood poured out then if I were silent. The paramedics arrive to take me away and I tried to persuade them not to cut off my clothes because I was not wearing underwear(my thought now is delirium) I was trying to maintain some modesty I guess. They are asking me questions as they get me ready, on the stretcher and through the ride to the nearest trauma ward a city over. We get there and as they wheel me in to er I get another scare as one doctor says \"he's probably a junky that got messed up in a drug deal gone wrong\" and just before I go out I can feel an intense pressure around my neck.",

Anyways, at the very tail end of our insane relationship we were having an altercation where I confronted him about being unfaithful (really should have been the least of my worries considering how physically and psychologically abusive he was). Brave move on my part that morning. He had me cornered in a spot of the house where I couldn’t get out but when he turned his back for a moment I bolted past him for the front door. I almost made it, but he tackled me to the floor a few feet from the door. All 240 pounds of him laid his entire weight on top of my body and I couldn’t breathe. I kept telling him I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t really yell under the weight. I had my phone in my hand crushed beneath my chest but the screen was facing up and I could see half of it. Don’t ask me how (it’s been almost 7 years now) but I managed to call the person at the top of my recent call list, a girlfriend of mine at the time who knew how dangerous he was. I called her and managed to mutter once or twice for her to call the police. I remember hearing her say “do you really want me to this time?” which was not an unexpected response given the cycle of abusive relationships…so many times I cried wolf and then took it back. At this point he reached up and wrapped his hands around my neck while ontop of me and that’s the last thing I remember. A while later, I don’t know how long, I woke up laying in the same position with my pants and underwear down at my knees. He sexually assaulted me while I was unconscious, and when I came to he was on the phone with a friend trying to figure out what to do with my body. It sounded like he might have been leaving a voicemail but I remember him saying, “Hey man I need you to call me back as soon as you can, I have a situation…it’s (my name)”. I’m pretty sure he thought I was dead. I laid there for a handful of seconds to regain strength and then bolted through that door and never went back.",

            "text": "When I was in college I had very little money, so I lived in the cheapest dorm the entire time. No AC, crappy heat. Also zero security but 35 years ago that was the norm.\n\nOne night just before the end of the fall semester a random nutcase came into the dorm and into my room. I was about to go to bed and was just getting up to close the door (which was open because this shitty old dorm had terrible ventilation and it was the only way to keep the room at a decent temperature). The guy came in, ran at me and started to beat me. Tried to gouge my eyes out too. He got me down and started slamming my head on the floor. Luckily the commotion got some of the other residents' attention, they came in, pulled the guy off of me and then proceeded to beat him nearly to death while I was laying on the ground half conscious with a severe concussion.\n\nCampus police arrived eventually and immediately called the city police. One of the campus cops told everyone that had beaten the guy to split and they did so before the city cops arrived.\n\nThe nutcase was a hard core druggie and was fresh out of jail - had been accused of beating his drug dealer nearly to death. He apparently scored some PCP and went looking to rob someone. The dorm beating left him with broken bones, a couple of fucked up organs and severe seizures due to brain trauma.\n\nThe city cops hung around for the rest of the night waiting for people to return but none of them did. They questioned me until the ambulance came but I had no idea who'd saved me and wouldn't have told them if I did. They went door to door on the floor for the next two days trying to find anyone involved, no success. The semester ended and when everyone came back after Christmas there was no more investigation other than me having to make a formal statement.\n\nThe nutcase wasn't charged for assaulting me but he did get convicted of attempted murder of the drug dealer. Got a really light sentence (basically time served) because of the brain damage he got from my fellow dormies. He couldn't walk properly or speak clearly any more either. All this according to a newspaper article.\n\nI had cloudy thinking, double vision and couldn't drive for six months. Enrolled for the spring semester, got all incompletes, finally finished over the summer. The professors felt sorry for me and passed me more out of sympathy than the quality of my work. I eventually got better but for about two years I'd occasionally wake up and wouldn't be able to see straight or think clearly for several hours.",

Pretend to cut her wrists and hold the knife to her neck and so on. \nDecember 11th 2017, I won’t ever forget that night.

I tried to reason with her and tell her I needed to let them in and she just screamed no and brought the knife up to my neck. \nA couple seconds later the cops start kicking at the door and she throws the knife and bolts for the bedroom. I ran over and let the cops in and I SHIT YOU NOT, they were SWAT officers. Dude with a rifle was in front, guy with a handgun was behind him and two other guys with just tasers after that.

Well this little area only has one street light. For some reason I decide to count my money under said streetlight. While I'm doing this, some guy is walking super fast towards me. He came from behind a tree, in the pitch darkness where someone has no reason to be at 3am. My brain went into flight mode instantaneously and I ran 3 blocks down the street. Afterwards I looked back and the person didn't follow me. I still wonder if I was supposed to die that night.",

            "text": "Someone’s comment here just sparked a memory I haven’t thought of in years, funny how the brain works! I don’t think it fully qualifies as a murder attempt, but I’ll comment anyway. I was a runaway, homeless, drug addicted teen, so a very easy target and prime candidate for being victimized. I was 14 or 15, and had met a man who seemed nice and offered me a ride somewhere (and probably drugs, can’t remember) because it was late and I either had no money for the bus or it wasn’t running at that time. He drove me into a neighborhood and parked. From the drivers seat, he grabbed my arm and wouldn’t let go. I was able to open the passenger door and I tried to get out but he wouldn’t let go. For some reason I remember being rather calm about this, I didn’t scream or anything. I picked up my purse and dropped in on the grass outside next to the car (street parking). He then dragged me out of the car through the drivers side by my hair, and dragged me across the street and up a driveway to the side gate of a house. At this point I finally was able to get to my feet and get some bearing. This part is definitely fuzzier, but there was a struggle and I ended up on my back. I can’t remember if he stepped away for a second to go open the gate or not, but next I remember him bending over to try dragging me in again. This part is clearer, I specifically remember him having his legs slightly spread to bend over, and so I reached up and grabbed him by the balls as hard as I could and didn’t let go. In that moment I remembered a news story I’d heard when I was younger about an old woman who was attacked during a home invasion. Her attacker tried to rape her. She grabbed his balls in a death grip and wouldn’t let go, and apparently by the end of the struggle her attacker was on the floor begging her to call an ambulance for him. I think the irony of that is what made me never forget that story because it was almost comical. Anyway, apparently dude had had enough of the ball torture I was inflicting and took off running through the gate, leaving me there in the driveway. So I took off running, back across the street to grab my purse, and then hauled ass for a couple blocks till I knew for sure he wasn’t chasing me. A few streets away, a south sider posted up in his driveway with a coors light in his hand had seen me running and asked if I was ok. I told him what happened and he said “fuck that, not in my neighborhood. I’ll put out a green light”. Idk what happened to the guy after that, and tbh I couldn’t pick him out of a crowd of 2 much less a 6 pack print out of dmv photos (I’d had to do that once before already, and I was lucky to make it out alive in that situation too). It was late af at that point and I knew I needed to find a safe place for the night, so I ended up sleeping inside an empty fireworks stand that night, that was posted up along a busier main street, a few city blocks away from that house. It’s been quite a ride, and I’m very grateful to still be around as I know I’ve gotten lucky many many times over. I do have ptsd, but more so due to other instances, but that’s probably the reason I tend to “forget” a lot of these memories so maybe it’s kind of a good thing? Either way, for this story, big thank yous to Spooky and Grandma Deathgrip, the latter who may have unintentionally saved my life! Stay safe everyone!",

We’re halfway on a short street as I see someone that just turned on the same street we are on. I can see in the distance that he is holding something in his right hand, but I can’t quite make out what it is. He’s walking right under a big tree that was blocking all light. As we approach each other, I now realise he’s holding a gun in his left hand, but we are too close to each other for me to start running or to tell my girlfriend how to react. I was 18 at the time so I was pretty clueless anyway. We are now steps away from each other and my instinct is to grip on my girlfriend’s hand and pull her behind me as I see his hand lift slowly. I didn’t panic for some reason, but actually thought I’d ask what happened to him? \n\nMy girlfriend stood behind me and was in shock, so didn’t say anything or respond at all. He proceeded to tell me how he lost his mother’s house, he doesn’t care about anything and doesn’t have a purpose to live. I didn’t know what to do and just said to him that time heals and that he doesn’t have to do this. All this meanwhile a gun is pressed to my forehead. He eventually backed out,  offered to shake my hand, then to shake my girlfriend’s hand, who refused, making me think ok we dead now, but he said thank you and he proceeded to step in the opposite direction. I pulled my girlfriend’s hand and just legged it as fast as we could. \n\nCalled the cops, nothing happened. \n\nWe went on holiday the next day with a sense of relief that we are alive.",

I was head over heals and in the process of a promotion at work, and when I came back to my apartment (my 2nd that I got a deal from the landlord to get refunded for all the work I did.) so I was busy from the moment I woke up, til I went to bed at night. Well, about a month in, I am looking at my pill box and noticed something was off. I couldn’t put my finger on it but KNEW I needed a pregnancy test.  It never occurred to me that a BF would even touch my pill box. It was new territory for me. So I went to the Planned Parenthood on a break at work. (We worked together, if he messed w my pills, I couldn’t let him know I knew) so I talked w my manager earlier that day and set it up. \n\nI was at least 9 weeks pregnant. I was bowled over. I had some in savings 50$ if that and I needed to think about my next steps. I got back to work and the manager asks me how it went. My BF heard. \n\nThat night he beat me unconscious, all in the stomach while screaming he wouldn’t be trapped in a situation he didn’t cause! I had never been beaten so badly before. I drove myself to the hospital, baby was fine but I was very bruised and had two broken ribs. I was stupid and lied about how it happened. But I was most certain what my decision would be. \n\nSame thing happened the next night and the next. All the way up to the day of my abortion. He drove me, he refused to talk w the councilors. I was so heart broken. She (I knew sex and date of birth w/o ever having a ultrasound ). I Named her. She deserved to be remembered and loved. And I did not change my mind. The last night before the abortion he really went to town on me. My arms, my legs, my back and front. I knew for certain he would kill me w/o an abortion.  \n\nAfter the abortion, was the worst night of my life. He pulled out his hunting bow w 4 razor tipped arrow and had my cat not been positioned the way he was between us, u would be dead. He let loose the arrow less the 8 ft away and my wonderful, loving cat jumped at the precise moment to bat it to miss my eyes and graze the top of my head. As he jumped to do that I jumped up and grabbed the cat and ran for the pay phone. \n\nOnce the cops arrested him, I had a few friends come over and move me the fuck out of that apartment back to my parents. I put a protective order and he was in jail for 4 days. Then he started stalking me. The morning he got out he came right into parent house w/o knocking!! Straight up to my room. Luckily I had an aluminum base ball bat next to my bed, I was ready for him this time. I beat the ever loving hell out of him chasing him down the stairs. Dad called the cops again and we filed a breaking and entering on him. \n\nIt’s been years now, we are talking 25+ and my parents still to this day get an anonymous card, telling them I will be his, signed a secret admirer. Cops don’t care. I live my life as if he is still stalking me. \n\nEdit to finish it accidentally posted before I was done. Sorry so long. And no you don’t get a TLDR.

I yelled at him to stop pointing the gun at my mom and he pointed it at me. I honestly don't know what made him stop maybe he realized I had a friend over?

One weekend he took my mother and the four of us kids out on the boat, and we ended up connecting with his boss and his wife on their houseboat near Key Largo. We spent the day with them catching shrimp from their houseboat and a thunderstorm came up. My father said we had to get back to the car because we had church the next morning. The thunderstorm started getting nastier, and his boss and his wife said we should stay on the houseboat instead to avoid the storm because it was getting really bad. My mother wanted to stay, but my father demanded that we go back because he didn't want to miss church.\n\nWe climbed in the boat and headed straight into the thunderstorm. I was only 5 years old at the time and it was terrifying. The boat almost capsized several times all of us kids were crying and my mother begged him to turn around and go back to the houseboat. He repeatedly refused to go kept saying he had to get back so we could go to church the next morning. I'm not sure why he finally turned around, but he did and we went back to the boat, soaked to the bone, and still absolutely terrified. We spent the night there and went home the following day.\n\nCould have just been hard headedness, but a week later my father told my mother he was in love with another woman and wanted a divorce. It took about 40 years to put two and two together, but after I told my suspicions to my sister, she agreed he was probably trying to have a boating \"accident\" to get rid of his wife and kids but chickened out at the last minute.\n\nI'll never know for sure what his true intentions were, but I know after that trip I never wanted to be on a boat again.

I stayed with him because I assumed it was depression or anxiety and he just needed to work through it. He became super controlling and manipulative. He never hit me but would threaten to. One time he drove almost 130mph because he was mad at me.   But I eventually ended it and we went our separate ways. \n\n\nAbout two years later he apologized. He said he was in a bad place and after we broke up he went downhill. He was homeless and on drugs for a while but got his act together and started working.

He said when I stopped moving he assumed I died. I woke up later on the floor covered in my own piss and confused. He looked down at me from his gaming chair and told me he would give me a xanax if I rubbed his back.

This corn maze had clues to help you find your way every couple of turns and at one of the posts a guy in all black came up behind me and asked if I needed any help or if I was alone.

He put his hand over my mouth and another along my waist also trying to get into my pants. He whispered really horrible shit to me that I’d rather never repeat to anyone.

I thought I would pay it with my debit card just like I always had done.  Unfortunately this night the card scanner at the front door wasn’t working.  No worries I thought, I’ll run down the street to the bank and pull out some cash from the ATM.  The ATM was attached to the outside wall of the bank and not in a lobby with a door that locked behind you.  Long story short, I pulled $20 out and turned around to see three guys quickly approaching me…like within 5’ of me.  \n\nI had my wallet, the $20, and my debit card in my hand.  One of the guys pulled a gun out and told me to empty the account.  I think I was only able to pull $300/day so after fumbling around with inputting the daily maximum, the cash door opened, one of the guys grabbed the cash turned with put the gun to my head and pulled the trigger.  The gun either jammed, or misfired and I was still alive.  Ended up cracking me on the crown of my head with the pistol stunning me while they ran away.  \n\nThis is kind of therapeutic, I’ve never told anyone in my family or even my wife that this happened.

I biked up and instantly got a bad feeling in my gut. \n\nNeighbor girl was standing in front of her garage, which was open. Inside in a small mesh playhouse was her little brother and the other neighborhood boy we all played with (they were about 5 btw), hiding inside the small playhouse. I hoped off my bike and started walking up to the house to park and said hi. Neighbor girl spun around and hid her hands behind her back saying, “Hey! Guess what I have a fun game for us all to play today!!” I was about maybe, 10-15 ft from her, hands still on my handlebar. I asked what is it and she said, “it’s called you have to listen to me game, or else I’ll cut you!!”\n\nAnd revealed behind her a giant pair of scissors. I don’t know if maybe the fear in my memory is making me exaggerate them, but I remember they were huge, like sheers for cutting fabric. Neighbor girl then motioned me to go inside the garage and go into the playhouse or else “I’ll cut your arms open!!” With just this smile I still remember to this day, Wild like an animal. I just remember looking at her, looking at the boys hiding in the playhouse and it was the first time in my life I felt an adrenaline rush to survive. \n\nI hoped back on my bike and started peddling like my life depended on it. Neighbor girl started screaming and chased after me on her bike, screaming she’ll cut my stomach or my knees open if I didn’t stop running. I just kept biking and once I got to my driveway I just jumped off and ran inside my house and started locking all of the doors. I watched her for what felt like an hour but pry only a few minutes, casing my house and checking all the back doors to try and find a way in. I screamed at her out my window to get away from my house and she screamed back how she would “make me bleed.”\n\n\nAfter a while she went home, I think the other neighbor boy escaped while she was at my house. When I talk to him about what happened nearly 13 years later, he doesn’t remember it at all, but it fits with a lot of other weird, kinda psychotic behaviors she had like kicking dogs and trying to crush small animals with rocks. Whenever I think about this event, I know deep down if i had stayed or was just a pinch slower than her, I think she would have done what she said to me. Even as kids I do think she wouldn’t have hesitated, or at least on accident go to far. This girl was always aggressive and never was shy to physically hurt us when she was mad. Biting, punching, choking, she’s done each to all of us neighborhood kids at one point. \n\nI stopped playing with her after that. I still think about that grin and it always sends a shiver down my spine.  Her family moved away about a year or two after this event, after her mom had an affair with the catholic school principal in the chapel and was caught by the Pastor. I hope she’s well, and her brother, and she’s not as vicious as she was when we were children.",

My brother and I both knew about this and where he kept the guns. He had two rifles, a 22 caliber rifle, a 3006 six rifle, and a little 22 caliber revolver. One day we decided that we wanted to play with the little hand gun, so we went to my parents bedroom and got a little gun from one of his drawers in their dresser. He also kept the ammunition for the revolver in the same drawer. My brother took one of the bullets and put it in the gun and spun the cylinder. I told him to let me have it for a minute, and he handed the gun right to me. I pointed the gun at the window and squeeze the trigger. Nothing happened. I then pointed the gun AT MY BROTHER’S CHEST and squeeze the trigger TWICE. Again nothing happened. I pointed the gun one more time at the window and squeeze the trigger, and the sound of the gun going off was very loud in that bedroom. Of course, when my mom and dad got home there was hell to pay.\n\nI’ve never forgotten how close I came to possibly killing my brother, whom I loved, and I still let out a sigh of relief that he went on to have three daughters, and adopted two boys who belonged to his wife’s brother who had died of cancer. He saw to it that the kids who wanted to go to college, did go to college, and he was not a rich man. He just worked way harder than any man should have to work so those kids could have a decent start in life.",

            "text": "Storytime! Finally one I can answer lol. \n\nI live in Washington, and we all know the PNW is a serial killer playground. Lotta remote places to hide a body, or keep someone. \n\nYears back, my sister and I, then 27 and 25 respectively, took a cabin trip for my birthday weekend. My birthday is in autumn, so generally this time of year, folks have packed up their summer cabins and returned to civilization before winter rolls in. It's a great time to get outdoors because there are less tourists. \n\nOne night, around midnight or so, we took my dog out for a walk (shiba inu, world's least helpful dog breed) before calling it a night and getting some shut eye. \n\nWe were in a pretty remote area and though there were cabins peppered around the woods and surrounding this little lake we were staying by, there was almost no one around because folks had already made their winter exits. \n\nSo here we are puffing on a joint walking down a  dark lonely road lined by towering evergreen trees, just doing our thing. Nothing out of the ordinary, but I've been the victim of a past attack (rape) so I have a certain level of awareness that my ironically more paranoid sister doesn't share (she's paranoid about all the wrong shit and oblivious to some of the bigger things). \n\nNaturally, I was keeping an eye on our six. From a ways off, I noticed some headlights coming down the road. As the vehicle approaches, I notice it start to slow down, but once it comes closer into view, I'm able to make out through the darkness (we had a full moon that night thankfully) that it's just a police suv, county sherif. They shine a light on us and roll past us super slow, I hold up my bag of premium dog shit and give them a look of \"What, you want my dog shit? All yours buddy!\" and they see it's two completely unintimidaitng white bitches shuffling down the street walking a dog, so they opted not to shoot us and kept going on their way. \n\nAbout 3 to 5 minutes later, yet another set of headlights appear off in the distance to our six. I can tell it's an older set of lights, too boxy for more modern cars and definitely not a police cruiser.\n\nThough they're still a ways off, there's this little itch in the back of my mind. Not a lot of cars come through here this time of year, especially in the dead of night, and for some reason, something just feels *off*. \n\nNow, we're walking on the left side of the road by the oncoming lane, and this truck is coming up on the right. I'm keenly listening and watching, my sister is minding her own business, and I notice as the truck (diesel engine) grows nearer, it down shifts. It starts slowing a bit, and as it goes rolling by us, it was far too slow for a lonely mountain road in the dead of night. People fly by at 60+. Cops slowing down is one thing. A truck on the other side of the road slowing down? Nah, that isn't normal. \n\nAbout 300 feet ahead, there's a stop sign at a 4 way intersection. \n\nNow, I'm already on high alert at this point. Something is off. We slow down and watch this truck come to a stop at the intersection with its left blinker on, but the truck just sits there. Old 80s-something Ford F250. I can make out two silhouettes in the cab. I stop and immediately tell my sister to recede into the woods. She doesn't hesitate. I'm the risk taker. I'm the one who lives on the edge, and the one who's been through some shit. She knows if I'm uncomfortable, something is up and it's not a false alarm. \n\nEVERY single fiber in my body is alert and that itching in the back of my mind is now a low growel. This is wrong. \n\nMy sis goes about 50 feet back into the tree line safely obscured behind the thick underbrush. The lake is a ways through the trees, so we have an exit if needed. \n\nI slink to the edge of the underbrush and duck down, and watch. \n\nThis truck sits for a good full minute, maybe longer, hard to tell time when you're pumped full of adrenaline. So I watch and I wait. Maybe they're lost. There's no signal out here, so they might be looking at a map book or trying to discern the right direction. I make no brazen assumptions, but I'm not about to do anything until I know what they're doing. \n\nThe backup lights come on, and slowly, the truck starts backing up. I can see them looking through the window trying to find us. \n\nAt this point, I know exactly what is going to happen, so I recede further back into the underbrush and signal for my sister to get ready to book it. Sure enough, the truck comes back to the spot where they saw us and two men get out. They're looking for us. \n\nSilently, I recede further into the woods. They know we're close, but don't know where we went. I signal to my sister to stay silent, don't move, and if she has to, drop the dog's leash and run. The dog is a barker, and he's the least of my concerns at this point. He'll be fine. He's a fast little bastard. My sister is not. She' S 130lbs overweight. I can outrun them. She can't. \n\nUnder the cloak of night, I watch and listen as they begin to creep toward the treeline. I can hear them talking in hushed voices, but I can't make out what they're saying. I don't need to---I learned a long time ago to ALWAYS listen to your instincts. \n\nI still have a good bit of distance from them, so I decide to divert their focus. I quietly pad at the ground at my feed until I find a rock. I silently thank my parents for making me do ten years of softball, and I launch that rock as far as I can. It's far enough to exit the woods and cross the street and hit the underbrush on the opposite side of the road. \n\nThe two men immediately freeze, I hear them mutter something, and they head toward the sound. \n\nStupid bastards. \n\nThe moment they're far enough way not to hear me move, I dash into the woods to where I told my sister to hide and say, \"We need to go  NOW. Don't run, move quickly, watch your footing. No noise.\" \n\nSilent as the dead of night, we disappear deeper into the woods with only the moon and starlight breaking through the thick canopy to guide us. We reach a vacant, dark cabin along the lakes edge and some small part of me curses at the stupid hope that someone might be home. No matter, we've found the lake and just need to circle clockwise to make it back to our cabin on the other side. \n\nAs we break the treeline and reach the shore, we're in the clear to run and not make a shitload of noise breaking branches and kicking forest debris. \n\nFlight instincts are fully engaged, and we book it around the lake's black, depthless waters. My heart is hammering so loud in my chest by now that I wouldn't even hear anything over that sound, so at this point, we're not looking back. \n\nAfter the longest fifteen minutes I have ever experienced, we make it to our cabin and slip inside, lock the door, and proceed to have the post-adrenaline crash of our lives. \n\nAll I had on me was a buck knife. I haven't gone out without my. 44 since. \n\nWe didn't get attacked, but I didn't need to wait for that to happen to know what was going to go down if we stuck around. I don't need to wonder. I've been there once, and never will be again. That knife? That's not for self defense, that's for taking a motherfucker with me, but I am not keen to die just yet. \n\nBless the dog for being silent the entire time. I think he sensed what was going on. It's the only time he has ever NOT barked at shit, and I'm glad he listened because we might be dead if he hadn't. \n\nThis isn't the kind of place you fuck around with a truck and two men on a lonely, midnight road in the deep wilderness.\n\nTwo years later I had my first guard and protection dog. I solo camp and my #1 threat out there isn't bears or cougars or moose or any wildlife. It's humans. Men. \n\nI sleep a bit easier now. My dog will alert me to anything afoot and if he growls or barks, it's only when here's a damn good reason for it. He's sent suspicious men walking to the other side of the street to say clear the fuck away from me. He's put himself between me and a would-be attacker and demonstrated he's willing to brawl to protect me. He listens to my commands, and he's silent as death thanks to some huge fluff padded snow paws. \n\n\nRegardless of what those men truly intended to do, it was nothing good, and the sherif wouldn't be coming down that road again anytime soon. \n\n\nOf all the horrific shit I've been through in my life including multiple near-death incidents, this one was perhaps the most unnerving, and the most terrified I have ever been. To this day, I remember every fucking second that is seared into my mind. I remember the hammering of my heart, the tightness in my chest and throat, the churning in my gut, and the clear, intense focus that flooded my viens. Despite the fact that nothing ultimately happened, deep down, I know we escaped something horrific, and even just telling this story again so many years later, I feel that dread creeping back in, squeezing my chest and making my heart race, my fingers shake. \n\n\nBut few things are as vivid as my sister's face when we got back into that cabin. White as a sheet, she looked at me and said, \"I knew the moment you turned and told me to hide, that it was serious. If *you're* scared of something, I know you're not fucking around.\" \n\n\nI will walk down a dark alley at night. My sister will not. I will go places I shouldn't. My sister will not. I've never been attacked in places that seem dangerous. It's always been the places that felt safest---the places I let my guard down. People I thought I could trust. Situations where I feel safe. \n\n\nSo when I tell my sister to stop fucking worrying so much, it's my way of saying \"When you panic about everything, it makes it really fucking hard to tell when something is actually a threat. Like a dog that barks at a leaf drop. When you stay alert and keep your shit together, you can separate the noise of your paranoia from the real red flags, and you will see red flags you might miss because you're hyper-focused on all the wrong shit.\"",

My father’s loud mouth and threats to a couple of dead beats (long story) pissed off some bad people along with off this town’s meth-head white trash version of a drug lord. at first they did smaller things, like breaking our windows and spray painting our outdoor lights black. Next, we heard footsteps and barking one night in the back yard, and when we came out, our German shepherd was sitting on the second floor balcony with a bloody shoe in his mouth. Not long after, night time comes again along with footsteps and barking.

I was a VERY small child (also a small adult) and around 5 years old I’d probably be the size of a 3 year old.

By the time my mom got me out I was covered in sweat and tears and was horse from screaming and almost to the point of unconsciousness. My mom did have come checked immediately and the doctors said it was perfectly fine after the fact but that it was so important she got me out because given how she described my symptoms when she got to me and my current state in the hospital, it was clear I was very, very near suffocation. \nWe moved out the next day.

            "text": "So, I've told this story on ask reddit before, but hey let's go for it again. Idk if this means specifically first degree murder or just being in a situation where you could lose your life. This is the post I made before, I just copy/pasted it to here. \n\n\"I was 15 almost 16 and I was dating a 23 year old drug dealer. He was really good to me at first but it quickly turned abusive. I got into a lot of situations that I shouldn't have been in, including one where a gun was shot right next to my head. \n\nThis dude had a lot of enemies, to the point where I'm not even that confident he's alive anymore. He didn't care about any danger he put me in, so when he answered the door thinking it was one of his regular customers, there was a man holding a handgun, I'm not sure what kind as I was fucking terrified. He always told me that if anyone suspicious came to the door to duck into the bathrooms. I'm sure it was mostly because he didn't need anyone finding out he was dating a minor. When I tried to do that, I heard a gunshot go off and the bullet hole was right next to me lodged in the wall. I immediately fell to the ground and covered my head, and I felt arms go around me. My boyfriend, to his credit, was actually trying to defend me. So when this guy came up to him and stupidly pressed the muzzle of the gun into his chest and began threatening him, demanding free drugs, my boyfriend immediately went for the gun and it went off right next to my ear. My ears immediately started ringing and I honestly think I blacked out or fainted out of shock or fear, because when I came to my boyfriend was in the apartment alone, his knuckles decently bloody. \n\nLong story short: don't date older guys on tinder. \n\nTLDR: Drug dealer boyfriend is held at gunpoint for free drugs and I had a shot fired next to my head.\"\n\nThat's my story. Noises that sound like gunshots still make me panic and go into a state of terror. That's the closest I've ever come to dying at someone else's hands.",

I caught up with an old \"boyfriend\" (let's call him A) since we were in elementary school but I liked this guy in my class(let's call him Z). Long story short after things sped up with my old boyfriend I broke it off with Z. \n\nIt was February 8, 2008. Z went crazy and called the house phone multiple times that day. We were off of school that time during these phone calls. I don't remember what we were talking about but I know he couldn't take no for an answer. I ignored him as time went on and had a double date with one of my best friends and their bf and A. My mom had to go shopping so I was stuck inside with my brother until then but also the same time A showed up and waited for my mom too.\n\nZ went to the next level on crazy and walked maybe 2 miles from his house to mine with a .22 Winchester concealed in a blanket. He brought it out after he asked me what I would do if he had a gun on him which I reply to call the cops. He then pulled it out and pointed it at me. I don't remember what I yelled or screamed but I remember calling 911. A and Z were fighting for the gun until Z just gave it to A and emptied the gun and I took the gun away locked it in my moms room with me in it.\n\nMy mom got the call while she was checking out and rushed right over. My brother was safe as he hid underneath the computer desk he was maybe 6yo at the time. \n\nIt was a long process to deal with it. I moved counties that summer. Z got a slap on the hand, A got a hero award and a few words from my father. My older siblings were pissed about the situation because being the youngest and they weren't there for me. \n\nI always thank A for saving me. But I'll never forget how things like this can be reflected to my kids. I will teach my daughter to be clear on what she wants and I will teach my son about consent and not be persistant (well to both kids and not be persistant) \n\nI'm 29 now. I have 2 kids, engaged and have a house with the love of my life. He knows about what had happened and is super careful about stuff like this. As far as PTSD from that experience it has subsided. Therapy has helped in the past, which has helped with the PTSD. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read it.",

I immediately kicked him out after this event. \n2 months after our break up and next to zero contact, I got back from class and parked my car in the garage.

I opened the door, expecting to see my place in a mess but instead my ex boyfriend was sitting on my bed. For reference, I lived in a basement suite attached to the garage. \n\nI didn't ask any questions and immediately lost my shit. I was yelling at him to get out while he very calmly asked me to just talk to him. I wasn't having it. Then I noticed duct tape on the bedside table and I questioned it. He grabbed the duct tape and got up, wrestled me to ground, and taped my feet together, then my hands. He flipped me right side up and at this point I was screaming and crying, hoping someone would hear. He put a ball of socks in my mouth and duct taped over it. I almost choked to death on the socks - a blood vessel in my eye popped. I ended up having bruises all over my body from the fighting too. \n\nI was tied up for a total of 22 hours. After I had calmed down he took off the duct tape from my mouth. We would talk but if I said something he didn't like he would put the duct tape back on. Survival instincts kicked in. I had to convince him I still loved him and I had forgiven him. I told him all of our future plans were back on and pretended that the whole event has made me realize how much I missed him. We played a game and watched a movie while my hands and feet were still duct taped. I offered to take him to his favourite place for lunch, if he would untie me. I helped him get rid of the evidence and obliged to everything he asked of me. We had lunch on the agreement I wouldn't use the bathroom at the restaurant. After the restaurant, I was driving (he doesn't drive) and said we should go to our friends house to announce us being back together. This was his best friend - he was excited. He took my cell phone, passport, wallet and hid them in his pockets. We got to the door and once our friend answered, I looked at my car keys and said, I forgot something in the car. I got in the car and drove to where a friend worked. He filled up my car and I drove 4 hours away - straight to my parents house. I don't know how I made it all the way there. I was a wreck.\n\nWith my parents support, I went to a police station to make a report. He was arrested and my belongings were given back to me. Then released on bail. He made sure everyone in my phone contacts knew I was with him again, though. Our court date was set to about a year from the event. \n\n7 months later, I was living in a different basement suite, close to my parents place (4 hours from the city of my university). I was working, healing, and keeping to myself. I got a call every now and then from him - although there were strict no contact orders. He would call me from various pay phones and I would hang up as soon as I knew it was him. I got a phone call from him that day, he said \"I've done a terrible thing, I need to know you can forgive me\". I responded with a simple \"stop calling me\" and hung up. I regret not listening to him. Later that night, I got a call from my sister at 2 am, she said my ex just left my parents house and was on the way to me with my dad. \nMy ex had entered my parents house and threatened my 70 year old father with a knife, demanding them to make me get back together with him. He locked the doors, closed the blinds, and took all the phones away. He stayed in parents house for 6 hours. My mother ended up serving him tea and some food as he had been homeless since he had last seen me. He was waiting there for me to come home, not listening when my parents said I didn't live there anymore. He had called me from my parents house but I hung up on him like usual.\n\nHe took my 70 year old father to his car and put a knife to his side with orders to drive to my place. I hadn't had my parents over other than help from moving in, my dad's memory wasn't the best and he got lost. My ex cut him with the knife on the arm, saying it was a warning and my dad found his way to my place. During this time, my mother found an old land line phone from storage and used it to phone my sister to warn me. My number had changed so many times my mum didn't know it off by heart.\n\nAfter my sister's call at 2am, I jumped out of bed with the intent to just drive to safety. I hadn't even gotten out of my room yet and I saw a call coming in from my dad. I knew it was my ex. I answered and my ex asked me to come outside. I played dumb, pretending to be asleep and asked why he had my dad's phone. My ex just said my dad was okay. I immediately called 911 and gave them my address trying to tell the operator of the urgency and danger I was in. My ex smashed my window, I screamed and hid in the closet with the phone still on the line to 911. My ex found me in the closet and asked me why I was hiding. He helped me up and showed me his bloody leg from the broken glass \"look what you made me do\". He grabbed my phone and hung up. He looked at me, puzzled, I almost felt guilty. He said \"why would you call the police on me?\". My dad popped his head in the window and asked if I was okay and I told him to stay in the car. Neighbours from 3 houses down had come out after hearing my screams and my dad was panicking - trying to tell them what happened. There were multiple 911 calls at that time. My ex led me to the front of the house with intention to get me somewhere private so we could be alone. He was greeted by some neighbours with baseball bats and then a police siren. He ran as soon as he saw the flashing lights. \n\nAfter I finished the police report, I drove to my sister's house, about an hour away. The police escorted me the whole way. I found out later that the police dogs found my ex at 4 am the next morning. Once we went to trial, he was sentenced for 3 years. I had to relive the whole experience in the court room, it was horrible.\n\nIt was my first boyfriend. I'm grateful that everybody is still alive today - things could have ended up a lot worse.\n\nI don't tell a lot of people this story but when I do, it gives quite the shock!\n\nTL;DR My ex tied me up for 22 hours then broke into my parents house and cut my dad with a knife getting him to drive to my place",

            "text": "I’m going to hop in with my story about getting kidnapped. My abductors had no intention of killing me, but they wanted to cause me harm and I’m going to deal with what happened for the rest of my life. I just feel like the story belongs here.\n\nI’m not very afraid of walking alone at night anymore. Something you will see in this thread of responses is a pattern of people who are close to you and family members being the ones who attempt to harm you. I’m not saying a creepy van can’t roll up and snatch you, but it’s much more likely to come from inside the house.\n\nMy abduction like 98% of abductions was family based. Two family members conspired to abduct me as a child. Abuela wasn’t a very sound minded woman. She had been unhinged for years and from the sounds of it, my dad dealt with a lot of abuse in his childhood. Mental illness runs in our family and I’m trying to break the chain with medication and therapy. My uncle was mentally Ill and an addict. He was the one abuela sent to come get me. His only role was to be the delivery guy. He picked me up, brought me to Jersey City, and dropped me off at Abuela’s place. I think he might have had some idea. I remember bad vibes in the car. \n\nAbuela was a spiteful lady. She was mad at me for something that I can assure you was not my fault, and petty for her to take to this level. I wasn’t even aware of the incident she wanted to discipline me for. I had to piece things together from what social workers told me. But this psychopath acted like everything was fine. Like she had a surprise for me and that’s why I was there. We watched Ice skating on the tv and I went to sleep on the pull out couch. She kissed my forehead goodnight. \n\nI think it was around 3AM that she attacked. I was deep asleep when I was awoken to getting the beating of my life in the dark. Jersey city has a lot of light pollution so I could see a little that it wasn’t a stranger, it was her. She screamed at me to apologize. She ripped my clothes off and beat my bare flesh. I felt something pop and when it was over I couldn’t move my leg. She held onto me for three days, and I couldn’t walk the entire time. The rest of the time was just me alone in a one bedroom apartment in the projects with her. I didn’t leave. I didn’t talk much. I was scared. \n\nShe threatened me not to tell anyone, but looking back it was impossible to hide. I thought I was brave in coming forward, but any parent would have put the pieces together. I somehow got my leg back together and somehow got home. I don’t recall how. I just remember going to my mom and saying “I have to tell you something.”\n\nTo my mom’s credit, she took me to the hospital. She did right by me and got the state involved. It would have been really easy not to. Lots of family abductions don’t get reported. The whole family was pretty torn apart by it. There was a lot of blame. A lot of threats. \n\nThe doctors found bruise evidence of hand prints and blunt trauma from being beaten with a whip. She had weapons she used on me. I only saw her one more time before her death in 2005, and it was a supervised visit. I never got therapy for it as a kid. Just had to speak to weird church leaders who were very unqualified to council me.\n\nI try to talk about this experience because even twenty years later I don’t know how to. But I feel somewhat liberated because the chances of getting abducted twice are very low. So the likelihood of a rando grabbing me while traveling is statistically against me. But a few lessons I hope you get from this:\n\n1.) if a child doesn’t like a family member, trust them. I didn’t like being around my uncle, and he sold me to Satan for two corn chips.\n\n2.) if you don’t feel safe bringing your kid somewhere, they don’t feel safe. Every time I went to my grandmas I knew it was a dangerous situation and that she was not a qualified adult. I still don’t understand why my parents ever let her feel comfortable enough to take me on her own without telling anyone. I don’t understand why I ever went to her house. \n\n3.) you are probably thinking of a family member right now that you aren’t sure of. Unless you are SURE sure that they would never harm your child, limit their interactions. \n\n4.) I cannot stress this enough, these crimes are family crimes. Take honest regular inventory of who is around your child, and if it’s worth it for them to be. There was a history of abuse with this member of the family and I still became a part of that cycle. If you teach your kids stranger danger, also teach them to talk to you about anything they feel about family members or your friends. Ask them what they think. Trust their gut response.\n\nHope all of you are safe and that you all heal from these experiences.",

Talking back, smelling my own nuts per se. my dad use to try to do things to look cool to me (in hindsight), hitting on a lady at a drive thru window, flirting with a lady at 7-11…Now, granted, he may have just been cheating on ma dukes left and right, but it always felt like he was just putting on a show in front of me. \n\nAnyway, I always saw these things as disrespectful to my mom and would tell him that. (I was on some stupid high horse when I was younger, smh.) This would always piss him off and he would go on about me “staying in a child’s place.” I often would secretly catch him watching scrambled porn on tv back in the day. One particular night, he did something that pissed me off, broke my super contra snes game, and I told my mom about him watching porn. I’ll never forget the look of utter embarrassment in his face. \n\nHe storms across the room and throws me into this bookcase in the living room, kicks me in the chest, jumps on top of me and chokes me. I mean chokes me so hard that my eyes feel as though that are coming out of my head. I can’t breath at all. He wouldn’t stop. The look in his eyes said it all. He was going to kill me. He didn’t care. Fuck this little uppity bitch of a son. How dare you rat on me….I remember my mom just staring and begging him to stop, but he was on a mission. In my 13 or so year old head, I knew I was either dead or had to find a way not to be . I tried with all my strength but I couldn’t get this mofo off of me. He was too strong and things are starting to get dark, fade away…my left hand (probably both, but I distinctly remember my left hand) falling frim his wrist, to the floor where all the bookcase, picture frame shit was on the ground from his initial attack. I felt a glass shard cut into my hand, which gave me some sort of adrenaline rush, because i found the strength to wrap my hand around that bitch and plunge it deep into his shoulder. I could have killed him. I stabbed as hard as I could, at whatever I could. In hindsight, i’m so glad it wasn’t his neck or eye. That was still my father…\n\nI mean, blood sprayed from that shoulder like something out of a movie. He howled out in pain, released his grip and ran out the room…I blacked out and honestly don’t know what really happened after. My mom never really spoke about it. My dad was away from the house for a few days. I just remember it was really awkward when he came back. We didn’t speak or interact with each other for weeks. I was out a school for a few days because the whites from both of my eyes were completely red and my mom didn’t want me to tell anybody what happened….my dad and I were never close, but we were cool after all that. I respected him as my father, but that’s about it.I didn’t come from a lovey dovey home and can count the number of times we said we loved each other in that house on one hand. Years passed without I love you’s or affection of any kind. It was sort of an unspoken rule that “we loved each other”…we never had and physical altercations or arguments after all that. My dad passed away like 11 years ago. I cried, I mourned, and through it all, I still miss him dearly.",

I headed downtown to treat myself to a creamy coffee from Philz. The shop was right across from a state university so it was pretty busy/there were quite a few people out and about. I parked and was walking across an intersection when I heard something clatter behind me. I looked around and there were people kind of looking at me shocked and I don’t think they even knew what was going on.

I looked back after I get across the cross walk and I saw this man running to get the screwdriver and then he started running at me. I was not fit for running in that moment (I was wearing platform sandals not that I couldn’t run it was just difficult) and this man was yelling at me calling me all sorts of profane names and yeeting a fucking screwdriver at me. And I kid you not people just were giving me a sympathizing look as I ran by and not helping or calling 911. I end up ditching my shoes (which were just slip offs) and running as fast as I could into the coffee shop. I hid and watched the man LOOK FOR ME. I told the cashier to call 911. They did, the man eventually gave up and walked away. \n\nI ended up calling the police, didn’t want to press charges but def wanted him evaluated for mental health purposes.\n\nI was so confused as to what had just happened, as a woman who’s addicted to horror movies/true crime podcasts all I could think about while running from that guy is how that screwdriver could of, if thrown the right way, just impaled me somehow (which is my biggest fear).

I don’t know what my brother went through (though he claimed later he was abused by my grandfather and an uncle) but he was clearly troubled, perhaps a sociopath. It’s hard to know what was true and what wasn’t as he was always very good at lying. What I do know is that he wanted my sister and I dead. I grew up in a war zone of chronic psychological torture, sexual abuse, and a few murder attempts before my brother was forcibly removed from our house in a violent showdown when my sister and I were 7 years old. The first time I know of that he tried to murder my sister and I was when we were babies, though he claims it was an accident. He pushed our dual stroller into traffic. The social worker didn’t agree that it was accidental and had him removed from the house into foster care for a time. \n\nThe last time he tried to kill us was the night he was told to leave when we were 7. He said he’d leave after dinner and then lunged for the utensil drawer and the butcher knife within. My Dad saw him grab the knife and tackled him. He tossed the knife from his hand and forced him out the front door. I have no doubt he would have stabbed and killed us all that night if he hadn’t been stopped. \n\nHe moved away and lived as a pimp and drug dealer on the streets before moving across the Country and starting a family of his own. We found out many years later that he abused his daughter extensively over her childhood. He offed himself a few years ago after he was arrested for crimes against his daughter. My sister and I had opened a case against him as well but the police said it was too long ago. I have no doubt there were many many crimes he was never held responsible for and many victims out there. The world is a safer place without him in it.",

Neither of us has been to prom so we decided to go together but the night went to terribly towards the end. \n\nHis mental health has began spiraling out and he was constantly in and out of therapy, I was there for him throughout it all. This led to him becoming overly obsessive with me, feeling like he was in love with me. I didn’t feel the same when he confessed* but we stayed best friends anyway. He grew to touching me romantically when I would tell him to stop he would get visually upset. \n\nOne time in the car he kept putting his hand on my thigh and I kept removing it and tell him to stop. The intersection we were coming up on was kinda scary, the right side blocked my huge trees you couldn’t see around until you got to the stop sign. Just before we got to the sign I was getting upset telling him to stop touching me then he just pulled out in to traffic that would’ve hit my side of the car and killed me easily. After that in fear I let him touch me. Thankfully not in any of my private areas. \n\nA few months before prom I stopped hanging out with him as much but would still chat often. I ended up going on a date with a guy I really liked and he got really jealous. To the point he was threatening* suicide and he couldn’t talk to me anymore. \n\nThat blew over and we went to prom. His friends all knew he liked me a lot and kept pushing me to slow dance closely with him and kiss him all night. He ended up getting really upset that I wouldn’t dance chest to chest with him or hold his* hand when we walked around and ended up leaving. We got lost in our city and couldn’t find the parking garage and he kept trying to hold my* hand but I wouldn’t and he was getting angry at me. \n\nI think it was about two hours before we found the car and on the highway home he told me he wanted to wreck the car and kill me and see me hurt physically. That he was seriously considering killing both of us in a car accident. That day he pulled out into traffic he was hoping I would get killed by on coming traffic. I didn’t say a word in the car and thankfully made it home safe. \n\nI never talked to him again, never saw him again.

            "text": "I thought of a story for this post about a family I know. The husband had a sibling who was addicted to drugs and she got pregnant, had 2 kids and was on drugs while pregnant with the kids. Needless to say, she lost her children and her brother (the husband) and his wife adopted her 2 small children. \n\nThe youngest child was a baby when they adopted them. The oldest child was old enough to remember his mom and harbored a lot of resentment toward the husband and his wife for keeping him away from his mom. \n\nCome to find out, this kid has dead spots on his brain from his mom being on drugs while pregnant with him. The husband and his wife had the kid in all sorts of counseling and therapy. This kid was not able to feel/have empathy and compassion. He was extremely manipulative and was all about me myself and I. \n\nThis kid would intentionally pee and poop his pants and pee on furniture and everything to get back at the husband and his wife when they would discipline him for lying and being manipulative. \n\nThe wife has 2 older kids who are teenagers from a previous marriage. The oldest of her 2 children tried to take the disturbed adopted child under her wing and tried to take him places to have fun. He got mad at her and peed in the seat of her brand new car. \n\nThis type of stuff goes on for a few years. As the kid got older, things began to get worse. People noticed he wasn’t nice to animals and the wife even caught him trying to get his baby sister to eat a thumbtack. She asked him what he was doing and she said “do you realize if she ate that, she would die???” His answer was yes, and that was essentially what he was trying to do. \n\nEventually the kid starts threatening suicide and the family started taking him to a new counselor. This new counselor uses a technique where he just lets the child talk and doesn’t try to steer the conversation. Come to find out, the kid tells the counselor he hates his parents and he wants to kill them. He told the counselor he hated his baby sisters and wanted to kill them too. He said he knew where the husband kept his gun and wanted to kill them all in their sleep. The family already had suspicions about him and they kept all the knives in the kitchen in a secure place. He was never allowed to have access to anything like that. \n\nThe wife asked the counselor if she and her husband should be scared of him. The counselor said yes, that the kid was serious and he already had a plan. The counselor’s advice was to put a lock on the kids door and to lock him in his room at night and that he needed to be closely supervised, even if you were in the same room with him, you needed to pay close attention and not be on your phone. \n\nLong story short: it turns out that the kid has attachment/bonding issues. The wife and her husband were able to find a place for him to go where he will receive proper care and therapy. There’s a lady and her family who have a background in mental health and they work with children like this one. They have a ranch and the kids come to her to live with her. She works on bonding with them by just holding and rocking them. They all have jobs on the ranch and a structured schedule. If the kids who come to her with these problems are found to not be able to return home, she adopts them and they stay with her until they are 18. Last I heard, the kid seemed to be doing a lot better. The family told me she has another girl who is like their adopted child. The girl will not be able to return home because her parents are her triggers. The family said he would probably not get to come back to their house because his sisters are his triggers. \n\nHis sister that they adopted with him, come to find out, she lived in constant fear of him. Since he has been away, she is a completely different child and is doing much better. \n\nWhen I found out about all of this, before they found a place for him to go, I remembered thinking it was like a real life Halloween Michael myers type situation. I was just really glad they were able to find a place for him where he will receive the care and help he needs to be rehabilitated.",

            "text": "When I tried to leave my ex fiancé. \nThe night before I left him he hit me in the face and that was the final straw for me. The morning of he was being an AH and I was so over it I just walked out the door of where we were staying ran down the street until I know I was far enough away that he wouldn’t immediately see me and then took a couple of back streets so he wouldn’t find me as easily, I think that just made him angrier cause he already had abandonment issues as well as a meth addiction so by the time he found me he was furious! I was silly and I went up to the car window to throw the ring back and say it’s over but I just got close enough for him to reach out and grab my hand and he tried to pull me through the window with such force that my head slammed into the roof of the car, while continuously trying to pull me through the window breaking the monsoon guard so it was cutting into my neck. When he finally took go I tried to run but he jumped out grabbed me and threw me into the car and pushed me into the passenger side. I thought about quickly jumping out of the door but just at the moment and truck went by so I want able to (I still remember the terrified face of the child in that truck from what he just witnessed) Ex then took off driving like crazy through the streets going 80km/hr in a 50km zone, the same truck that had passed us when he threw me in the car realised what was happening and tried to follow and cut him off but Ex was driving so erratically that it wasn’t possible. When we got into the highway he started losing his shit at me saying crazy shit and punching me in the face while driving as fast as he could (around 140km in a 100km give or take which is fast considering the roads) as we came to roundabouts and areas where he would have to slow down I tried to jump out a few times but he held onto me so I couldn’t. Between thinking of how to get out and begging him to stop all I could think about was how sad my mum would be to hear that I was dead. As we were coming to the end of the highway and heading out of town I knew that it was the last chance I had to escape where there would be people around to help as I knew he was taking to this abandoned house that was completely isolated away from everything to finish me off. So as we were coming out of a roundabout heading out of town I kicked the automatic gear stick as hard as I could putting the car out of drive and distracting him enough that he took his hand off of me and was trying to put the car back in gear that I jumped out of the car and tried to run (the car was still going like 30-40km so I got a bit fucked up in the process) I tumbled a bit but my adrenaline was pumping and survival instincts were kicked in and I just had to get away quick so I jump back up straight away and run to a car that was lucky a bit behind us that had stopped as she had obviously just seen what had happened with me jumping out. I jumped in her passenger seat locked the door and told her to drive away as fast as she could. I was so panicked that he was going to chase after me and pull her out and take her car and continue on as he had jumped out of the car and was standing behind it just looking at us with the expression that was so pissed off I managed to escape. I was begging her to “drive, please, drive away” as it took her a a few seconds to register what was happening I’m sure especially with the state I was in, half my face was completely swollen and bruised (I looked nothing like myself for weeks after and couldn’t even open my mouth properly to put food in, black eye for a month) I had road rash all down my leg. She did drive off quickly but was so shocked she didn’t know what to and where to take me, I’m sure if I lived closer and told her to just drop me off home she would have and that’s all I wanted to do was just go home and hide away by myself but my house was to far away and I had nowhere else to go so I asked to be dropped at the police station and she just dropped me off and gave me her number so if I needed to give it to them to have her as a witness. I went in and told them what had just happened and they already had people looking for him because the people in the the truck as well as others had called in concerned to report what they saw so they found him eventually (near that house). He was arrested and only got 3 years. (Unfortunately that’s a good sentence in my country).",

It's business as usual up until about midnight (the usual drunks falling over, diffusing petty shit like some guy stepped on another guys' Jordans or whatever).  \n\n\nFor reference, the bar is SLAM PACKED.  I'm doing my lap inside and I see a heated argument going on between a male (classic roid monkey - 6 foot 3 atleast and 220 pounds of solid muscle) and a female (about 5 foot 4 and 120 pounds soaking wet) about 20 feet in front of me (i'm 6'2 so I can see over top of almost everybody there).  It catches my eye.  Normally a simple screaming match between a drunk couple is by NO means uncommon in a bar, but this one looked \"off\" (can't explain it).  He's red in the face and she has her hands up signalling a motion like \"get away from me\" or \"go away\". And also the sheer size discrepancy. She looks petrified.  I immediately divert my course and start pushing my way through the crowd of patrons to get over there to separate the two, but before I can the guy winds up and punches the girl square in the face with such force she flew back quite literally 10 feet through a sea of people.  \n\n\nLuckily (or unfortunately based on your judgement of my timing), I reached him just as he regained his normal posture and placed him in a rear-naked choke.  My support seen this go down as well so as one of my other bouncers attended to the female, the other was with me helping to get full control of this guy to drag him outside (bouncer with the female was dialing 911 for EMS and Police because this poor girl's face was almost literally caved in).  My support and I wrestle this guy out the front door and YEET him onto the street.  Take down his description but (surprisingly) he leaves without incident and literally runs the opposite direction.  Normally when you have to go hands on with somebody in that environment, when you release them 99% of the time you have to anticipate a punch coming your way.  \n\n\nPolice come, we exchange information, they take the description, the statements, and review camera footage but ultimately leave after about 30 minutes.  Girl gets taken by EMS.  Back to business as usual for the rest of the night.  Fast forward to 2:00am - it's closing time.  We get everybody out of the bar and start our routine clean up (chairs, sweeping, etc) and then we leave.  \n\n\nNothing you have read until now is the \"attempted murder\" portion.  It was all backstory.  But get ready for this.  \n\n\nAt about 3:00am, the bouncers are all leaving, we get dismissed as a group once the end-of-night duties are completed.  We all exit through the bar's rear door into the parking lot.  Because I was still relatively \"new\" I had the late-start time slot so my vehicle was in the back of the parking area whereas everyone else's was near the front, we say our \"see ya next weekend's\" and break apart.  I'm walking to my vehicle when I pass by a set of cars with a guy standing between them, seemingly trying to conceal his identity (i'm still wearing my security shirt).  Lo-and-behold, it's the fuck-stick we dragged out earlier who now the police are looking for.  Before I could even register that this is him and there's an inherent danger present, he blitz rushes me and stabs me in the chest, underneath my right nipple (and ended up piercing between my ribs and puncturing my lung), my immediate reaction was to punch this guy in the face, so within 1/2 a second I gave him a right jab to the left eye socket, caving it in and shattering his orbital bone.  He drops like a sack of Idaho 'taters and, fueled by adrenaline and nothing more, proceed to stomp him until he's incapacitated.... with the knife still in my chest.  \n\n\nTwo of my co-workers who hadn't departed the parking lot yet ran over and called the police.  EMS and police arrived at the same time, EMS took the guy with police escort, I was taken to the trauma center but made a relatively full recovery.  Last I heard guy was sentenced to 15 or so years for a variety of offenses, including my attempted murder (i think it was a lesser degree charge based on the mitigating circumstances).  Didn't have to testify because he took a plea deal.  \n\n\nFast forward, I still do the job (albeit for a different bar).",

I had $40 and nothing better to spend them on, so we agreed to meet around 6 at an elementary school close to my house. What I didn't know was that one of my ex friends who I smoked with heavily during the summer was there with him. The problem with this guy is that he was a really sketchy and unreliable guy, and he had been a big antagonist in my sister's life before I started being friends again with him. Any who, once I met up with my dealer and paid him, he asked me if I wanted to light up, which I assume was supposed to provide a distraction or make it so that I couldn't tell what was going on. I sat down with him, and what comes next is still a little hazy in my mind. I can't recall if my attacker stabbed me from behind while I sat with my dealer, or if he had done so when he approached me, but I remember feeling this dull, aching pain, like I had just been punched really hard on both sides of my lower back. I had no idea what was going on, but as soon as I saw the bastard, I knew exactly what happened. Months before, he had been texting my best friend, asking her to pass along a message. He wanted me to go to that exact place to \"talk things out\", which we both suspected meant that he was going to jump me. It didn't take long for me to understand the situation, and once I figured out who I was dealing with, I begged for him to let me go. I told him that if he let me walk away, I wouldn't talk to him again and this would be the last he'd see of me. Once I was free to go, I hauled ass to my best friend's house, fading in and out of consciousness. I could feel my shirt and hoodie soaked through, but I didn't want to think too much about it until I got help. When I arrived at my friend's place, I had her look at my back, and by the tone of her voice, IT WAS BAD. I came to find out later that I had been stabbed in both flanks with a box cutter (I assumed he was probably coked up during this so he wouldn't have picked the best weapon), with the stab in my right flank being dangerously close to my liver. Had I been stabbed any further, I wouldn't be here to tell this story. Fast forward almost a year later, I don't have much trauma aside from being uncomfortable with knives. Anyway, that's my story. Goodnight, and stay safe out there, friends. :)",

She grabbed me and said thats him! And pulled me back over the sidewalk. As he was flying by I got a good look at his vehicle. By the time I was in highschool I could name almost every make of vehicle I see and sub model even in the dead of night  just by looking at their headlights driving towards me. So I looked, 1996 jeep Cherokee xj with the 4.0, purple in color with bubbling tint, various stickers on the back with black wheels. I recorded this information as my body hit the pavement, police were called and he was found within hours of my description of his vehicle, we went to court, I was ready to testify in the Court room but she did it and I didn't have too. Convicted of two counts of child endangerment, 2 counts of attempted murder with a vehicle. 20 years in prison. I suppose I wasn't directly a survivor compared to some stories on here but I immediately thought of this story in my life when I saw this thread.

Me and some friends went out to this party before Christmas and about a week before my birthday(Dec 31st) , as soon as I got there I was handed a beer, well that beer turned into about 5 and then that turned into shots and about 11 more beers. And to mention that I was about 120 at this time, maybe 110 because of my alpha gal, gastritis and IBS. After I did the tube chug thing about 3 things I forget everything after that. I was super drunk and unconscious in the back room with my friend “P”, well I threw up all over “P” and she decided I needed towels and water. As she goes upstairs (we’re in the basement) the guy who threw the party and his buddy saw me passed out sitting in my own throw up. He thought it was a good idea to throw me outside, well outside the door was a concrete patio, very tiny. As they picked me up, they carried me to the door and just tossed me like it was a video game, I know this because there was a video and you could see me grab my head as soon as I hit the floor. Well he cracked my head open, and I had alcohol poisoning. So as I was dying and bleeding out people saw me and said I needed an ambulance, well everyone but one dude “S” actually called them, but they already had the cops on the way for a noise complaint. I do remember looking into a light and answering weird questions like what my favorite food was and what my name was and blah blah blah. But anyways I got to the hospital and they put staples in my head and pumped my stomach. Btw my BAC was .277, if you don’t know .3 is a coma. The drinking was on my fault but still, he didn’t have to bust my head open and leave me to die. I can still take action today because it happened when I was a minor and I have 1 more year to do something about it. I can put his brother in jail for giving liquor to kids and ruin his college plans. Don’t know if I want to or not but just thought I should commented.

He tried kissing me once, and would always show up around my apartment. One day I was sitting on the top step (we lived on the second floor) and he showed up out of nowhere. I remember he had this really scary look on his face as he started up the stairs. \n\n   My now ex stepdad had locked me out of the apartment so I was waiting for my mom to come home from work.  \n   As the boy was walking towards me, he said in a low menacing voice “you are going to do whatever I say”. \n   Thinking he was joking I scoffed and said “no I’m not” at this, he rushed me. To this day I have never felt such a swift feeling of dread and terror. I have also never moved so fast. \n\n  I jumped over the railing and bolted for my neighbors house. I was friends with this girl my age who was from India, and I just remember thinking if I can get to her house I will be safe. She was around the corner from me and on the second floor. \n\n  I managed to make it up the stairs, but before I could reach her door he tackled me, flipped me over and dragged me down a few steps. Then he straddled me, wrapped both hands around my neck and began to squeeze. I fought, pulling at his fingers and kneeing his back. I remember the dark look in his eyes, his lips pressed together in determination, his heavy breathing, and smelly breath. I was just praying that my friend would just open the door and see me. I was this tiny little blonde girl, and this kid was much bigger than me. \n\n   My vision started to fade, and I was at the point where I was about to start begging and would agree to do whatever he wanted. Suddenly he stopped. The three little kids who lived downstairs had come outside and saw what he was doing. They started throwing rocks at him and screaming in Spanish. He jumped up and chased them out of view. In my panic I ran and hid under those same stairs. He didn’t come back. At least not that day.\n\n  Some time later I was walking to that same friends house, and that boy showed up. This time, he had a friend, another kid that lived in the complex about his age. They jumped me. I remember being kicked a few times, before they tried to drag me into the bushes. An older man started walking up the path, saw them, and started yelling and running towards us. The boys claimed they were just playing and ran off. I just ran to my apartment crying. My mom thought it was just rough kids being kids. I wasn’t allowed outside alone anymore though and that boy and his family actually got kicked out of the apartment because he had broken a few windows. He came back to trick or treat for Halloween and had the nerve to knock on our door. I don’t know what he was planning both times, but I have my suspicions. Thankfully I was sent 4 angels who showed up just in time.",

So, since she would not give me any details, I decided to go check it out. The street was empty yet so full all at the same time. I’m not sure how to describe or put it in to words really.

It turns out our neighbor over the wall and the house across the street had some fights of some sort. Our neighbor behind the wall I guess snapped and went across the street and killed everyone but one. The scene I saw when I got to the street was bone chilling. There are organs and blood all over the street. I’m talking about brains and intestines everywhere with dead bodies. Inside the house was full of blood and some of the relatives that were killed. Our wall neighbor was shot by the cops.\nThe family immediately retreated from socializing and barely engaged in any thing with anybody anymore. Our town was small yet big(huge population, small place), everything travelled fast. And chismosa travels faster than the internet, not to mention the criticism of the Filipino culture. \n\nI have only been back once. Even then, I haven’t seen them out. Every time I think back to that day, it didn’t even seem like the kids and their mom knew what was happening.

He fully intended on shooting me in the face but the round didn't fire. He knew I was coming and I called him 5 min before arriving. My friend was sitting on the couch laughing and I tried to laugh it off. Buddy was already high and smoking a blunt. I sat on the couch, hit the blunt a few times and tried to relax. Then G put the gun on the table and said \"I need to run to the gas station (around the corner) as my sister can't walk that far ( his sister was a little person, we didn't know at the time)...here\" and pulled out 5 different bags of crack and started to explain the prices to us. G: \" This ones 25, this ones 50, this ones...\" then there was a knock on the door. G grabbed the bags quickly,put them in his front pocket, picked up the gun putting it behind his back and cracked the door. I still remember vividly what the guy on the other side of the door looked like and said. He was white, short, had thick glasses. He said \" I have a speaker system in my car I can trade you you, I just will that work?\". G shut the door and told us to stay put as he opened the door and took him down the hallway to our left. As soon as he was out of sight me and my buddy booked it as fast as we could out of that house and never told anyone about it. The next day his house got raided and his sister during the raid got butstroked by the police because she spooked them when she came running around the corner screaming. Tl:DR Made friends with a Convicted Felon, almost got shot in the face then his place got raided and his sister is a little person.",

            "text": "Not as dramatic as the others but tossing my story. If you need to cleanse your palate from some of the other stories, give it a read.\n\nThe Mid 90s, hanging out at my buddy's house (basement apt of.2 flat in Chicago) watching I believe Die Hard. Voice in my head is telling me. to go home, as it was about midnight, but it was nice just chilling out. The phone rings, my bud answers and is like \"Ok, I'll go check it out\" and goes up a flight of stairs and outside. Our area was safe, but I kept thinking I should go with him and see what's up. He's standing outside looking at the street when he goes \"Hey Ray, get the fuck out of here!\" I'm thinking what is he talking about? When two heads pop up and take off down the block. We both think, let them go. Whatever. When his younger sister comes flying out of the house chasing after them. Great, now we must get involved. Being as it's our neighborhood, we can see where they're going to go and we know a shortcut through the yards. We get there and they're nowhere to be found. Just as we're about to leave, one of them is walking looking around and we're like \"what are you looking for mother fucker!\" He looked like he was gonna shit his pants. They were both about 5'3 120 lbs. My buddy was 6 foot easily 260 and pretty solid. I was about 5'8' 180, lifted every day, and just got out of the Marines a year earlier. We were pretty chill but would have wrecked these two if they wanted to go. lit up a bit as my buddy is talking to shithead number 1 \"Ray, why are you doing this? We took you in our house and this is how you repay us?\" I kept an eye on shithead number 2, with the idea I was only going to grab him if things get physical, or would only hurt him if he fought back. Shithead #1 was clearly the main character in this event. When all of a sudden, shithead #1 pulls out a gun. Now, I'd been in the Marines, never saw combat, shot plenty of weapons, but it was the first time having a gun pulled on me. Needless to say, it was like someone poured ice water down my back. I was like \"fuck 'em Chris (not his real name) you know who they are, let them go.\" My buddy goes full peacock, puffs out his chest, and keeps walking toward them. I kept telling my bud to go, and he eventually listened. After we got back to his house, I'm like we have to call the cops. Called them. Nothing. Called again. Nothing. Being a cop's kid, I'm like \"tell them a gun was involved\" Within minutes, unmarked squads from every angle.Now the area was lived in was safe for Chicago. Known as an area lots of city workers lived, thus lots of cops, firemen, etc lived there. They took care of their own area and didn't like any bs going on. Why the response was so fast once they heard \"gun\". Also, most of the on-duty worked the rougher areas, and this district was like a retirement district. Cops with 25 plus years, looking to take it easy.We are looking at the car, and we notice why the shitheads were squatting as we came outside. White car, black spray paint “N word”. I thought it was funny, as my bud and his sister are Irish/Polish, and the shitheads are some form of Latino.\n\nCops are walking around asking questions when one of the only black cops that ever works in this district is walking towards the car. He is asking if everyone is ok, etc, and as he approaches, I’m feeling bad he must read this. He cocks his head and says loud enough for us to hear “Stupid mother fuckers can’t even spell ‘N-word’ correct”. That cracked us up and allowed us to relax a bit after the gun was pulled.A police report was filed, nothing else happened. A couple of months later, cops pull up and find the two shitheads. Only probably for them was, my buddy’s sister's friends were there too stuffing the two of them into a trunk. Eventually, my bud’s sister dates shithead’s brother, gets pregnant and has his kid. Guy was also an idiot, but his parents had money, and he didn’t think he was the mightiest Latin King. They eventually broke up, and she got her shit squared away during motherhood.",

I had known him for over ten years. He freaked out over some bullshit with his wife. They had severe fidelity issues. He had a drinking issue and never took his medicine which was used to treat severe PTSD. Pretty much came over with a friend and both were coked up and shit-faced. They freaked the fuck out. A fight ensued, police were called and they were arrested. \n\nTheir truck was parked out by the road a few houses down. The house sits on two acres and the driveway is in a U shape. They found a few guns in his truck but at the time that wasn't a big to do. They launched an investigation which revealed a Facebook conversation \"on how they could best dispose of my body\". They believed the truck was parked out further so they could make a speedy getaway if they needed to. The other guy had two priors and got life in prison. The guy I thought I knew was involved in other stuff and they ran his other sentences consecutively which was pretty much a life sentence he'll be 68 when he gets out. \n\nA lot of stuff happens after most notability the lack of sleep and hypnic jerks induced by high levels of stress. The nightmares come later and those can be dangerous for the people you're sleeping with. It took one instance for me to realize I needed help. I went to a psychologist where I was diagnosed with PTSD and put on a generous dose of Paxil. It took four years of therapy and my departure from the area to get over it. The memory fades over time but you'll never forget it.",

Feeling fucking great on the way to pick up a friend and go back to my place and smoke a little. He was hyping up this weed he got and I didn’t have work so we were going to just chill and play Xbox all night. \n\nUntil a guy hopped in my car, pushed a gun to my neck and gave me directions. We drove for about 20 or so minutes, doing laps around a neighborhood I had never been to. I realized he was disorienting me in Downtown Jax.. I was a skinny ass white dude and he was an older, way more fit guy. Hindsight, I should have driven into a car, ran, something. Anything. But I was terrified as this was the first gun ever pointed at me. \n\nAt first he was calm, let me know all he wanted was my car to get to GA. Not worth fighting or dying over. He told me about some other people who got ballsy and got shot but because it’s a big city (murder capital of FL) .. he’s never even been a suspect. \n\nAnyway, we pull into this vacant house where he says his friends are inside. First time I ever heard the term ‘trap house’. Deadass I thought that meant a place they trap people for ransom or something. \nHe brings me into this garage with a closet and a workbench. There’s duct tape and a chair already there and he uses the entire fucking roll on me. Body.. face .. I was suffocated as a kid which was traumatic in itself and so I begged him to just not cover my eyes or nose with the tape. He actually obliged. \nThen he flipped. Until then he had been .. almost experienced.. calm and collected like I said. But then he pulled out a pocket knife. Idk the word but it’s not rainbow.. it was like purple but then he moved it in the light and it changed to blue.. anyway, he started gliding it on my arms, not deep but stinging and cutting. Poking me in the stomach, again not a stab but shit I had stained blood from the pokes and it was getting weird. He went back to explaining how he could cut me up in so many ways, shoot me and take my shit and it would be weeks before anyone even found me. I just sat quietly, didn’t beg or plead .. just thought .. this is it. And my parents will have no idea where I am, and my mom is going to be devastated and blame herself somehow and I’m dead. Out of all my close calls, THIS is how I fucking die.. and he’s right. I knew he was, Jax is a big city, I’m somewhere I’ve never been in some garage, and my asthma is getting worse. Asshole took my inhaler too. Out of the whole day, that’s when I was like ‘this guy is a dick’. Rob me, scare me, kidnap me, whatever but my inhaler? \n\nAlright so he eventually leaves, goes inside the house and I hear him talking to someone. He comes back and says ‘I’ll be back in a few hours and let you out’ \n\nI counted in my head and made it probably about 30 minutes of total silence. Nothing from inside the house. And I heard some talking outside that sounded like kids.. I licked my lips and spit so much on the tape around my mouth that the adhesive loosened up and I could get my mouth open .. I was scared to make a sound because if someone was inside but I figured either way I’m fucked so I start fucking screaming … HELP ME IM IN THE GARAGE HELP CALL 911 just screaming as loud as I can as much as I can. \n\nSo I’m sweating my dick off at this point and my arms are starting to get loose from the duct tape. He focused mostly on my chest to the chair, didn’t do a lot thank god on my hands. And as he did I remembered a video about clenching my fists so it wasn’t as tight. Get my hands free, start biting and ripping the tape as quickly as I can. Obviously nobody was inside listening or they would have come out. \n\nI’m loose inside this closet inside a garage. Didn’t have the balls to manually open the garage because I don’t know what’s on the other side. No more kids being loud .. just fucking fear. I had a sharpie that I always had in my pocket and wrote my name and birthday on one of the wooden work tables connected to the wall. I don’t know why but at least maybe it would help cops find me later. Just felt I should leave a location or something. There’s horizontal sliding windows that aren’t too big but the lead outside. I pie maneuver the window in slow section in case someone sees me.\n\nThere’s another house, chain link fenced in backyard, then a road that turns right. All I see. \n\nI open the window. I slip out and run like an absolute fucking track star. Hop the fence. I trip but keep going, hop the other fence and keep going until I see a construction yard and I start screaming for help. This guy comes over doesn’t speak a word of fucking English but he sees blood and I ask for his phone. He says NO. So I ask him to call 911 and eventually they arrive. I hide between the construction fence and one of those big green cable boxes and sit and hope I don’t see my car come around. \n\n\nCops finally get there, immediately suspect I was huffing paint because of the duct tape residue on my face. Another cop shows up gives me the water from his lunch bag and let’s me in the car. He takes me a little ways around the corner to get away from the area but sure as shit everyone’s mood changes when they see it’s a vacant home for sale, their allowed to go in the garage and see the chair. \n\nThey took me home and it was the first time, at 16, my mom ever handed me a cigarette (she knew I smoked but hated it and would never be okay with it)",

I feel like coming so close to getting raped, robbed and beat to death by crackheads and then finally talking about it and sharing the story in this thread both helped me immensely to start getting past what happened by taking baby steps but also inspired and hopefully convinced others to be as honest as they needed to be when it came to the details of basically one of the worst and horrifying times in your lives. \n\nThanks for being so forthcoming and brave while not holding back and powering through it guys and gals. I honestly appreciate it and it's healing and relatable reading all of your stories as well. Everyone that made it out and is still around to tell the tale, I'm glad you're a fighter and able to be with your families on Thanksgiving this year. Happy Thanksgiving everyone 💓",

I was around 6 or 7 so I dont really remember much but I was outside in the parking lot alone for some reason and these two guys pulled up in a stereotypical white van. They started talking to me asking me where my mom was and how my day was and then they asked if I wanted candy. They said it was in the bucket behind them and that I could grab it and as I was stepping into their van my mom came running out the door of the hotel screaming. I dont remember if they left after that but I never saw them again and the police were extremely nice to me, like they felt bad for me. one of them even gave me a toy. It never really sank in what had happened until I was around 16 and realized there was another time I nearly got kidnapped. It's crazy to think I couldve been trafficked or dead right now and that it nearly happened more than once. I'm so lucky. 😳🤯",

            "text": "Well im a little late but would like to add my moms story here. I will start by saying i am very very proud of how far she has came.\n\nA little back story: My mom had never been great at choosing men after she seperated from my dad who came out as gay when i was 3. (She stayed in the house not wanting us to feel as if we had lost our mom until i was 9) Until i was 9 i had 3 perfect loving parents and role models who showed me what love really is. By time i was 9 my mom had truly realized that my dad was never gonna love her like he used to although they were still best friends and she started trying to date again.\n\nMy mom was a strong woman and would never let a man abuse her, or do drugs. She met a guy named Aaron and was head over heels, he pushed her one night, she was heartbroken but she left him. She soon after met another guy and married the controlling bastard, while with this guy her mom, who was her best friend, passed away. She got a divorce a while later and left. She was extremely depressed and a few months later met Aaron again. Decided to give him another chance but this time she didnt leave when the abuse started.\n\nAfter 3ish years of being with this low life Aaron she had no self confidence left at all. He had made her work day after day and then would force her to put herself in danger by driving to meet strangers to spend all her money on his crack addiction (he popped any pills and drank as well but crack was his drug of choice). After being soo depressed and poor from buying his drugs she got talked into trying it and got hooked as well. Oh and she became a heavy drinker while with him but the crack got very bad. She easily dropped to 94 pounds at 43 years old at her worst. The whole 5 years my mom was with aaron i would only hear from her once a month if i was lucky and id only see her when she'd say she was leaving him, my dad would let her stay the night to get her away from him but she'd always be gone between midnight and 5am the next morning. He eventually stopped letting her come back cuz he felt he was hurting us by letting her make these empty promises just to diappear again shortly after. \n\nOne Christmas eve night i got a call that drunk, strung out, Aaron, almost killed my mom. He decided he wanted my moms last 3 dollars so he punched her in the face repeatedly then strangled her til she passed out. He thought he killed her so he took my moms car keys, stole her car and tried to run. He got stopped by the police for turning the wrong way on a one way. The cops went to the address the car insurance was registered under looking for my mom and when banging on the door they woke my mom up. She was drunk af so the cops took him to jail for the marks on my mom but failed to take pictures at the scene of the crime. She went to the hospital the next day, got pics taken and had a report of her broken nose and strangulation marks but since this was the next day and the cops didnt take pics the night before, none of this could be used against him. He went to jail for minor driving violations and got out after 15 days for good time served. She got back with him.\n\n2 or 3 years ago they got in another fight in their apartment, he drug her by her hair all the way to her car and threw her in, drove to a country road by a field telling her the whole time that he was gonna kill her and bury her body where no one could find her. She knew he was actually gonna do it this. As she begged god for a way out and promised to never look back, He ran over a dirt mound and when he went to reverse a bit before parking the car, she got out and ran down the country road trying to find any help she could, luckily for her there was one other car on the road who happened to be an off duty firefighter with his emt girlfriend. They let her in the car and sat with her until an ambulance took her in. She cut crack out of her life cold turkey, and never went back to Aaron again. About 2 months ago i saw him homeless on the side of the street begging for money. He always hated me because i had no fear when it came to him. We made eye contact as i stopped at the red light and i just looked at him dead in the eyes with no remorse. He was where he deserved to be. Alone. And he recognized me too. A week later he was pronounced dead from a heroine overdose. Im just thankful my mom left when she did cuz i have no doubt in my mind that if she had stayed, she would have been found dead right next to him.\n\nTL;DR : The last two paragraphs are all you really need to read.

            "text": "Not exactly a murder more of a kidnapping avoided, but those often go hand in hand. \n\nI was 10 years old and I went fishing with my dad. He took me to a bridge over a creek out in the country side there was a small side road that went down below the bridge and we drove below the bridge to park. \n\nWe got out and were fishing for a while just spending some quality time with my dad but inevitably as kids do I got bored and wanted to explore and this was the late 90’s so you didn’t really her or think much about anything bad happening to kids especially in our area.  \n\nSo I asked my dad if I could go around and explore a bit and he agreed eventually I asked to walk up (the fairly steep hill ) and check out the bridge above. We are in the middle of the country and nobody has come by since we had been there for the last couple hours so he said I could but told me if a car started coming I needed to get back down the hill to him so I agreed and headed up the hill. \n\nGot to the top walked over to the bridge doing the normal kid stuff threw a couple rocks into the creek hollering to my dad about how far up I was and silly things like that after a little bit I heard a car coming up the gravel road and so did my father shortly afterwards as he soon yelled for me to come back.\n\nNow in true juvenile fashion I made a split second decision that it didn’t make any sense for me to go down there as the car would pass in only a couple seconds and then I could carry on with my 9-10 year old shenanigans. I promptly stepped off the middle of the road and stood at the edge of the gravel as the car neared to give him plenty of room to pass. \n\nThis is where things took a turn that I didn’t expect. The car stopped and a middle aged man probably 40-50 got out of the car wearing what I remember to be not very well kept closes a denim button up open with dirty white  t shirt underneath both wrinkled and dirty blue jeans to match. He left his door open and started walking straight for me . I’m at the side or the road of to his right from the bridge dead ahead and he’s walking straight towards me without saying a word the look on his face blank but focused on me . It started to become apparent to me that something wasn’t right as I had been thoroughly coached on the ins and outs of dealing with strangers . But I’m the moment I froze and don’t remember anything beyond my realization that I had screwed up by not listening to dad. \n\nAs I had not returned and my father likely heard the car stop and definitely knew it hadn’t crossed the bridge he had dropped his fishing pole and hurried up the side of the hill and hit the top within view of myself and the strange man and hollered at me to get over to him barely after I could register the sounds of the gravel under his feet as he rushed up too us , at this point my father has appeared just down the hill from us but the man now about 10 foot from me can see him crest the hill just about between us . The mans expression instantly changed and he diverted his walk past me walking straight towards the bridge now. The strange man was probably about 6 foot tall and about 275 with a beer belly but easily intimidated by my father rushing up who was a 6’4 very muscular almost 400lbs at the time  (he was a commercial roofer that 200lb rolls of rubber up ladders constantly) the guy made it to the bridge and looked at it for no more than a second without a word until he turned around and had to walk back by us.\n\nMy father was now at my side as I was still in place frozen with fear and as the guy hurried back towards his hat made an awkward half worried comment about checking if the bridge was safe to drive over. My dad stared him down stone faced without saying a word the man got in his car and sped off quickly (across the bridge he was supposedly skeptical of the integrity of only a moment prior) I know without a doubt in my mind if my dad hadn’t come rushing up that hill that guy was about to pick me up and throw me in the back of his car and take me god knows where. \n\nNow at that age my father was with my oldest child being 10 I constantly tell stories of all the times I thought I was smarter than my parents and how bad some of them turn out because you never know when a split second of not listening to your guardian can turn into a life or death situation.",

I use to be interested in studying serial killers something that they do is confess to their next victim.\n\nThe man then placed his hand on my breast and I removed his hand and told him to let me out at the circle k here in Tucson Arizona at the corner of Grant and Craycroft. But he went past it,\n\nWhere are we going as he turned into the housing development behind the circle k. To the circle k, we past it go up to Craycroft I'll just get out and walk. He said I was nice and gave you a ride. I said stop trying to guilt trip me into f*** you. In that moment he grabbed the back of my neck forced me into his lap and made his move and put me in a choke hold. \n\nI was married to a retired Sergeant of Arizona corrections. He told me if their taking you to a different destination fight for your Life because I plan on ending it.\nSure enough the man stepped on the gas!\n\nHere's the thing. I have disassociation identity disorder aka multiple personalities. I was unaware I even knew deadly self defense. My \"alter\"(another name for personality or identity)named Nikki came busting through. I arched my neck straight so he could not choke me out. Put my feet on the passenger window to do so. He said b**** get your feet off my window. I flipped my feet onto the windshield and I could see a brick wall so we ( my alter & I) grabbed a hold of the steering wheel and aimed it towards the brick wall.\nI told him. If your going to kill us then I'm taking you with me!\n\nHe slammed on the brakes and through me to the passenger side. I got my purse and began to put the stuff that flew out back in, as I was opening the side door to get my suitcase out! Through this whole time he was beating me severely on my back. Remember his best friend was a she and she was beat to death\nSERIAL KILLER ...\nHe said get out B**** get out over and over. Finally I jumped out, soon the adrenaline went away in the pain set in!\n\nCircle k clerk was absolutely horrible to me it took almost a full hour for TPD( Tucson police department) to arrive on the scene! In which they gave paramedics the wrong information.\n\nBecause I can switch voices I did cause my vocal cords truly change, but the trauma was to much and several alters took over. I didn't come back as myself till 3 days later, guess where they put me \nMental health hospital, where I was healing from my attack, all the evidence on my back, and neck!\n\nOn my discharge papers it read claimed to be choked!\n\nGood Luck to all.

It's very foggy for me memory wise- I wasn't really paying attention. I didn't want to be with him as he gave me bad vibes and I've always been shy and easily frightened around males. We went to his room to look at his stuff and somehow I ended up hand cuffed to the door of his closet. He of course \"lost the key\". \n\n He pulled out his rifle from underneath his bed and was showing off his gun- I'd never seen one that close before and I was a shy and timid kid. Very easily scared by loud noises so I wasn't at all thrilled to have one close to me especially while I'm handcuffed to the door.\n\n Then he left to go get ammo or something for the gun. Or it was a key. It was something for the gun but again very foggy memory.\n\nI was too mortified by being in such close proximity to a gun to do anything.\n\nFortunately my dad came inside and saw me standing in the room. No one was pleased and both adults were rightfully angry. He was banished from my company and his gun taken for the rest of the visit and I have NEVER seen him again.\n\nThe kid unfortunately grew up and has made a lot of bad choices since, I always hope he's turning his life around but so far it's just bad news whenever I hear about him. Wishing him the best though.\n\nI'm still not sure what was going on, honestly, I didn't think about it until reading other people's stories of drowning or interactions with older kids.

The party was fairly fun, I didn’t really know much of the people who came besides the girls’s family and her closer friends but I did recognize one dude who I’ve previously known in like middle school/highschool and we caught up. We talked about how our lives as taken course and comparing our life choices; me going to college and whatever and him staying and involving himself in gang activity. (My city is notoriously known for heavy gang-related violence/crime and at one point and I believe currently is in the top ranking cities of having the most homicides in the state) \n\nFollowing that, I spent most of the time taking care of drunk individuals who were beyond unresponsive (they were okay just blacked out) including the host of the party. Pretty early in the night at around like 9pm maybe(?) A fight broke out between some people about some girl, I don’t really remember what the hell they were mad about but anyway, and things were broken and getting messy so birthday girl’s family had asked me to help get rid of everyone in attempt to avoid further violence.  However comma as I was helping escort everyone outside the property and getting people to go home, two young boys, drunk and intoxicated with multiple substances, were in the middle of the street being disorderly so I tried calm them down and advised them to go home before anything unnecessary happens. They had agreed in their own intoxicated way and were making their way to their car. \n\nyes I’m aware that they were in no condition to drive but I had other people I needed to take care of first ( birthday girl was the oldest of three, the other two being minors so they were my priority) and there was about like 20 people maybe or more who also in the middle street being stupid as well.\n\nAnyway, as things seemed to calm down those two boys, no older than 19, ran the opposite way of their car and started jumping my aforementioned friend so, instinctively, I did what I can to protect my friend. As you can imagine  tensions were very high and no one was helping me besides the classic screaming “Stop!” as I was trying to separate them. They had good reason not to intervene.\n\nAs I felt that things were getting worse, a car pulled up to us slowly and stopped about maybe 10 feet from us, the car angled so that the passenger was facing us. The driver gets out and runs around the trunk and I see him thinking “fuck yea finally someone is helping”. To my dismay, as I’m looking at the dude feeling relieved, this motherfucker pulls out what I think is Glock 40 and opens fire (about six shots). Immediately, I feel what felt like a flaming sword had pierced through my abdominal area. The boys are on the ground whimpering and crawling  and I’m still standing very confused, as everyone is screaming/crying in horror around me, as to what happened. Leading up to that moment I had spent my life trying to get out of that city and not succumb to gang-related activity that a lot of my friends fell to. I did what I could to avoid this exact moment, perhaps you understand why I kept yelling internally/externally “did I just get fucking shot??” “is this real??”.  I checked my stomach to find any blood but couldn’t find any which really added my disbelieve ( i had a dark red shirt on and it was night time so I couldn’t really see my blood). As the chaos ensues, I take a couple of steps forward attempting to call my girlfriend because although I didn’t see it where it went, I fucking felt every ounce of it and before I can pull my phone out I collapse in the street. During those moments, I knew I was going to die and I couldn’t muster up enough strength to call or let anyone know that I loved them. But, it was damn near impossible to focus on anything else except breathing- I had remembered several posts/blogs/whatever from “woke” communities about how important breathing is (yea , who would’ve known right?) and took the time to breath consciously and just focusing on inhaling and exhaling.\n\nWe laid on the floor bleeding out for what felt like a Mf hour and I could hear people in the distance screaming “Get them to the hospital!!! Drive!! Don’t wait for an ambulance!!” The hospital wasn’t too far at all actually maybe a 6 minute drive? Anyway, a random dude who was selling drugs thrown us into his car bc he didn’t want the cops to come and bust him?? (I think he lived in that street and just wanted to get out of there which doesn’t make sense to me but I was told later by the family of the random neighbor’s generosity and his questionable intentions, I’m not complaining tho ) I was conscious (and sober) until we were about 2 minutes to the hospital. I remember some moments when the nurses would ask me if I was in a gang and stuff because the other two boys were I think. It was actually kind of funny seeing their reaction when I asked them if they think I would make my flight back to college that following Friday lolol (happened on a Sunday night) and of course they said god no hahaha. \n\nAnyway, after waking up a couple of days later and spending one week in the ICU and another in the surgical ward, I left the hospital barely able to walk on my own with about 40 staples or so across my stomach and my groin area. The bullet had hit me from my left side of my ribs and exited out the right side, obliterating a several inches of my intestines and nicking some how my femoral artery. I still don’t know how I didn’t fucking die bc the doctors told me had I waited for the ambulance I would’ve got sent to the gulag on that godforsaken neighborhood. \n\nThis was about over a year ago and now I’m fully recovered with the occasional putrid farts and 1 degree hotter lolol \n\nKeep on breathing, you got this 🤙🏾\n\n\nEdit - grammar",
