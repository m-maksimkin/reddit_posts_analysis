It was a really cold and windy night, so he told us we could hang out in his living room and gave us some Mexican Coca Cola. He was the nicest man, we eventually had to leave because, you know, we gotta do our job, and as we get up, we both notice a gun (idk much about guns, it was a normal one? Like 🔫) with the man’s name engraved on it. Once he saw our frightened reaction and sight line, he immediately moved away from it and calmed us down, it was totally fine. It was my first week canvassing, and I was afraid this man had lured us into his house so he could torture and kill us. And we were in LA, people usually don’t have guns lying around so that is weird\n\nAnother take away: why is your name engraved on the gun? Are you afraid it will get lost with the others at whatever weird event you go to where you routinely check your guns like most people check coats? I don’t understand",

If anyone has laid a mega-poop, you know that sometimes it won't flush. It lays across the hole in the bottom of the bowl and the vortex of draining water merely gives it a spin as it mocks you.\n\nGrowing up, this was a common enough occurrence that our family had a poop knife. It was an old rusty kitchen knife that hung on a nail in the laundry room, only to be used for that purpose. It was normal to walk through the hallway and have someone call out \"hey, can you get me the poop knife\"?\n\nI thought it was standard kit. You have your plunger, your toilet brush, and your poop knife.\n\nFast forward to 22. It's been a day or two between poops and I'm over at my friend's house. My friend was the local dealer and always had 'guests' over, because you can't buy weed without sitting on your ass and sampling it for an hour. I excuse myself and lay a gigantic turd. I look down and see that it's a sideways one, so I crack the door and call out for my friend. He arrives and I ask him for his poop knife.\n\n\"My what?\"\n\nYour poop knife, I say. I need to use it. Please.\n\n\"Wtf is a poop knife?\"\n\nObviously he has one, but maybe he calls it by a more delicate name. A fecal cleaver? A Dung divider? A guano glaive? I explain what it is I want and why I want it.\n\nHe starts giggling. Then laughing. Then lots of people start laughing. It turns out, the music stopped and everyone heard my pleas through the door. It also turns out that none of them had poop knives, it was just my fucked up family with their fucked up bowels. FML.\n\nI told this to my wife last night, who was amused and horrified at the same time. It turns out that she did not know what a poop knife was and had been using the old rusty knife hanging in the utility closet as a basic utility knife. Thankfully she didn't cook with it, but used it to open Amazon boxes.\n\nShe will be getting her own utility knife now.",

If anyone has laid a mega-poop, you know that sometimes it won't flush. It lays across the hole in the bottom of the bowl and the vortex of draining water merely gives it a spin as it mocks you.\n\nGrowing up, this was a common enough occurrence that our family had a poop knife. It was an old rusty kitchen knife that hung on a nail in the laundry room, only to be used for that purpose. It was normal to walk through the hallway and have someone call out \"hey, can you get me the poop knife\"?\n\nI thought it was standard kit. You have your plunger, your toilet brush, and your poop knife.\n\nFast forward to 22. It's been a day or two between poops and I'm over at my friend's house. My friend was the local dealer and always had 'guests' over, because you can't buy weed without sitting on your ass and sampling it for an hour. I excuse myself and lay a gigantic turd. I look down and see that it's a sideways one, so I crack the door and call out for my friend. He arrives and I ask him for his poop knife.\n\n\"My what?\"\n\nYour poop knife, I say. I need to use it. Please.\n\n\"Wtf is a poop knife?\"\n\nObviously he has one, but maybe he calls it by a more delicate name. A fecal cleaver? A Dung divider? A guano glaive? I explain what it is I want and why I want it.\n\nHe starts giggling. Then laughing. Then lots of people start laughing. It turns out, the music stopped and everyone heard my pleas through the door. It also turns out that none of them had poop knives, it was just my fucked up family with their fucked up bowels. FML.\n\nI told this to my wife last night, who was amused and horrified at the same time. It turns out that she did not know what a poop knife was and had been using the old rusty knife hanging in the utility closet as a basic utility knife. Thankfully she didn't cook with it, but used it to open Amazon boxes.\n\nShe will be getting her own utility knife now.",

If anyone has laid a mega-poop, you know that sometimes it won't flush. It lays across the hole in the bottom of the bowl and the vortex of draining water merely gives it a spin as it mocks you.\n\nGrowing up, this was a common enough occurrence that our family had a poop knife. It was an old rusty kitchen knife that hung on a nail in the laundry room, only to be used for that purpose. It was normal to walk through the hallway and have someone call out \"hey, can you get me the poop knife\"?\n\nI thought it was standard kit. You have your plunger, your toilet brush, and your poop knife.\n\nFast forward to 22. It's been a day or two between poops and I'm over at my friend's house. My friend was the local dealer and always had 'guests' over, because you can't buy weed without sitting on your ass and sampling it for an hour. I excuse myself and lay a gigantic turd. I look down and see that it's a sideways one, so I crack the door and call out for my friend. He arrives and I ask him for his poop knife.\n\n\"My what?\"\n\nYour poop knife, I say. I need to use it. Please.\n\n\"Wtf is a poop knife?\"\n\nObviously he has one, but maybe he calls it by a more delicate name. A fecal cleaver? A Dung divider? A guano glaive? I explain what it is I want and why I want it.\n\nHe starts giggling. Then laughing. Then lots of people start laughing. It turns out, the music stopped and everyone heard my pleas through the door. It also turns out that none of them had poop knives, it was just my fucked up family with their fucked up bowels. FML.\n\nI told this to my wife last night, who was amused and horrified at the same time. It turns out that she did not know what a poop knife was and had been using the old rusty knife hanging in the utility closet as a basic utility knife. Thankfully she didn't cook with it, but used it to open Amazon boxes.\n\nShe will be getting her own utility knife now.\n\n[Edit: Common question - Why was this not in the bathroom instead of the laundry room? Answer. We only had one poop knife, and the laundry room was central to all three bathrooms. I have no idea why we didn't have three poop knives. All I know is that we didn't. We had the one. Possibly because my father was notoriously cheap about the weirdest things. So yes, we shared our poop knife.]",

Beside the couch was a huge stack of Penthouse magazines, right out in the open. As soon as his parents left for work we would hang out with his friends in the living room and look at naked woman, trading our favorite pics. Ok, not too odd even though I had only seen one Playboy in my whole life up until then. Then one day we walked to the local high schools playground and we're shooting the shit with a few other kids. Somebody started talking about jerking off, and asking about how quick we could cum. The conversation turned into why don't we have a game where we all jerked off to see who could cum fastest. I had the impression that this wasn't the first time for some of them. My cousin made up an excuse and we left in a hurry. Funny thing, if he hadn't insisted we leave I would have joined in ;).",

They did have PCs though, because father was an engineer. They didn't let him play video games or to get a phone, but were perfectly fine with him 'going outdoors'. So of course we went to friend B to play Warcraft2. So much for no vidiya.\n\nFriend two had a perfect replica of the tv drama family. Younger brother that could never be wrong and was always doted upon, while the friend would always be at fault, 'addicted to video games(played max 2 hours per day, his brother did the other 8 hours), never studying (His brother had 2.5 GPA(on a scale 1-6), the friend had 5.5), and never doing sports(friend spent 3 hours daily doing sports, his brother none). They were the perfect example of classic drama tv problem family. Best part? Problem family drama was their mother's favourite tv show. Dude would literally run away from home to get some rest by staying overnight at one of our clique's houses, and the parents thought it was normal. Once his mother called me in the middle of the night as she was hunting him down, certain he was at some friend's home trying to illegally access video games. \n\nNow, third one is just funny anecdote. My mother had a friend at work(both were teachers). She had twins, and they were always made to be those perfect kids, that never made any problems and were ideal examples to hang out with. The only downside was they they were always on the phone. We went on a trip with other teachers and their families. First thing those twins(iirc 13/14) did when we were left alone was show 10 y.o. daughter of another teacher BBC BDSM Furry porn( On those phones they never left alone, of course). Idk details, since I was too happy with my Nintendo to interact with others, but I recall that the experience kinda fucked her up and she came back to watch some more with them, and few years later I saw her as she became a porn-addicted antisocial dweeb. So... uh, yeah, perfect kids. Zero problems.",

            "text": "I once went to a girl friends house from a BD (behavioral disorder) School i went to. We bonded on a lot of the fucked up shit we did. Long story short we bonded over some stupid fucked up shit we went through or did before attending that school. She invited me over to her house, (it was about an hour and a half from mine). My parents dropped me off and then we were hanging as usual kids. Went to the park, smoked and went back to her house. Her 'man' came over named, Beau. We were all hanging and then moved from the patio into this like, upstairs living room.\n\nThis is where shit got real fucking weird for me. It was a, 'were all super high falling asleep watching a movie nap kind of time', right? I'm laying on a bed next to a window. Girl is next to me, and Beau WAS on the floor. I'm half asleep and all the sudden the two are straight banging next to me. Look, I'm 26 now. I've done some shit, seen some shit, and been involved in a lot of shit. HOWEVER, we were like 15. Which for me specifically at the time, was fucking absolutely wild. Especially cause this shit gets even more fucking interesting.\n\nTHEN, they finish off, right? No. I can't remember all the context but the next thing I can remember now is that were sitting in her bedroom and she's like, \"I have to go to the gas station.\" and i asked for what cause I'm like, you're gonna leave me here with him alone at your house when he isn't supposed to be here? (her dad was bound to be home whenever idk)  She told me she now needs condoms. I'm thinking, okay girl hope you already had one but whatever.\n\nSo, she left. BEAU STARTS FORCIFILY MAKING OUT WITH ME AND ASKING ME TO FUCK HIM. I was like ?!?!?!?!?!?!? I said all the things a person could say to nicely say fuck no. He kept pushing. Thank god the front door opened and she was back, and then her dad LUCKILY warned her and had said he was on his way back from his meeting or whatever it was.\n\nTHEN, I tell her what happened because I'm like she needs to know that this guy she \"loves\" is not the best dude. All things considered. This bitch completely lost it on me. Started slapping and pushing me like really really really hard. Screaming at me how much of a slut I was and that I should go kill myself. At this point i had a flip phone with some real shit battery and data plan. My phone had died some time earlier before so after she literally shoved me out of the door I had to navigate myself through the biggest unfamiliar rich boujie neighborhood to a gas station, to ask the dude to use a phone and get a hold of my parents.\n\nWe went to school together for another few months but never spoke again. It was a school of about 40 people including all the teachers and therapists. Still friends on Instagram and a few years back discovered she does anime porn now. Honestly, fitting. Happy she's happy and doing well, hopefully can take some relational constructive criticism better now.\n\nEdit- to further anser the question, she acted like I was the crazy one and that everything that happened was totally casual and normal. Her dad even defended everything she did when my parents had called to be like what the actual fuck. Why is my daughter stranded at a gas station when we left her under your care. I was allowed to do a lot of shit, and then the one actual time a parent says, \"I am watching your child\", completely don't and my parents have to save me....... yikes fml. lol",

My cousins completely cut her off because she has gone off the rails the last few years. \n\nMy Mom was an abusive alcoholic drug addict who made my life HELL. So while I had the clean house and good meals, my mother was being extremely abusive to me in the background. Growing up I was actually very jealous of my cousins. My cousins dad (my uncle) was, and still is, an amazing person who loves his children. He managed to turn his life around and make a new life for my cousins and himself and is remarried.

Not quite hoarder levels, but sometimes it got close. My early childhood home, especially, tended to have a main pathway to the sitting area, the bedrooms, kitchen and entrance. When we moved when I was 12, the big house had lots of space, but that got pretty messy, too. All except the entryway and living room: those were kept spotless and furnished like something out of a Better Homes and Gardens magazine. No one was allowed to use that room for anything unless a guest was over, and guests weren't allowed to see the rest of the house. \n\nWe also didn't have sleepovers as kids, and guests were limited to only the occasional major study session, and only for a few hours. It wasn't until I was well into my 20's that I realized other mothers didn't beat their kids when their father wasn't home, or that father's didn't normally work 16 hour days. We weren't allowed to answer the phone, ever, and in my teens I found out we were dodging creditors. \n\nI was really proud when I came home from boot camp as a US Marine, and my recruiter commented to my parents \"He hasn't changed at all.\" I thought it was a great compliment, proving that I was raised properly and had taken my lessons to heart. \n\nLater I took some psychology classes, and my father and I learned what a \"sociopath\" really was, and suddenly everything made a lot of sense.

That meant almost all of our meals were at the dining room table. The only exception was the night Star Trek was on (He was in the sciences in the Military, kind of a nerd, but an officer none the less). They lived \"normal\" and ate healthy. He retired from them military when I was 13 and his Military-provide medical science training and education gave him a 6 figure job right out of the gate. My best friends parents were poor hippies. Like, \"went to Woodstock and never left\" kind of hippies. Our first several experiences with pot were the shit we snagged from his parents and smoked. Eventually, we started smoking along with them.\n\nOne night, me, my friend, our girlfriends, and his parents were around just passing a joint. His mom goes to make supper. She comes back with a Tupperware of the best munchie-food-stoner-quaso I ever had. It was just Velveeta and ground beef, but I was high, and unlike my mom, his mom didn't drain the fat when she cooked it. That was supper. A far cry from the 3 course-TV-family suppers I normally had. It rocked my world. But, the idea of having what is basically a snack food as diner was a foreign concept to me.\n\nThe part that has always interested me was that, while I thought his folks were cool and fun and great smoking buddies, he used the term \"won the parent lottery\" to describe my living situation. He would have traded his hippy parents that I loved for grow up with the most Norman Rockwell family you've ever met. I see what he was saying. My parents set themselves up nicely, then were always about to help me and my sister while my best friend ended up having to help his parents pay their bills. My parents are kick ass, loving, wealthy, forgiving, etc. But I wouldn't complain if I had his folks either. It really is true what they say, the grass is always greener on the other side.

We aimed show everyone else that he wasn’t some weirdo, but just a little different. Welllllll the first time we went to his house there was cat shit everywhere on the floor. We understandably freaked out and were like “Yo is your cat ok? It shit all over the floor” and he was like “no yeah it’s fine…it just shits on the floor sometimes” and we were like “are you gonna clean it” and he lets out a big sigh and goes “ugh I guess I can”. We let it slide and tried to think it was like a one time thing maybe. Until he invited us back and said “I can clean up the cat shit before you guys come over”. He was completely oblivious to the fact that cat shit should not just be left to sauté all over his carpet. Over the course of a year he eventually learned that if the cat were to shit on the floor, it should be cleaned up immediately. He made some good progress to being a normal person until he half admitted to sexually assaulting two girls and we cut him off after talking to the school administration about it. Odd dude.",

Anyway, I’m in the house by myself and I’m walking through the kitchen to go out to the backyard when out of the corner of my eye I see someone sitting in a chair watching me, I turn to see who it was and no one was there. I turned back to continue and I felt the feeling of being watched and in the reflection of the window I once again saw someone sitting in the same chair I just passed by, and I turned to look again and nothing. I went outside almost white as I ghost myself, poured myself another drink and sat down quietly for a few minutes just kind of still feeling watched. I told my friend and he told me sounds about right. The next time I was there I had absolutely no experiences, no feelings of being watched, nothing when I fully expected it. I mentioned that to my friend and his response was you showed you belong here so no one has to watch you in the family house. Never going to forget that night though.",

Girls, Boys, it doesnt matter. Whatevers close is a weapon, usually a shoe or some sort of cooking utensil in the kitchen.\n\nAnd im talking not like a swat on the ass or a dress down. Im talking like straight up giving them the business. Not one swing, not a half hearted swing, no half stepping bullshit.\n\nIm talking mom was like an ex-mma fighter whos parents were probablly the same lineage, and beat the shit out of her and her siblings.\n\nSo, it continues and the kids get their asses straight up kicked.\n\nHowever the family was always nice and the kids were.. well.. obviously the kids were very well mannered of course until the mother or father found out that they did something wrong. Come home late, got in trouble with the cops, found some weed on them, got caught smoking cigarettes. Or one beating i saw was because of the younger of the brothers was caught with beetlenut and had like a stash of all the things used to \"chew it\". A few cigarettes, some leaves of some kind, beetlenuts that were fresh so he obviously went to the local asian market and purchased em there, the knives or razors to cut the beetlenut, the like crushed up coral mixed with something to make some sort of paste, and everything else needed in this little stash box he made a hiding placei n his room for (which all of this was forbidden in this household until a certain age or just period no questions asked ).\n\nAnyways, beetlenut is some sort of local ( to them ) like chew. Its this hard green nut ( fresh ) that you slice like 4 times, and then take a piece of it, along with a bit of loose tobacco from a cigarette, some of that coral paste stuff, and then wrap it up in this leaf thing. Put in mouth. Over time it fucks your teeth way up, and can turn your lips red ( never have seen this, but once i looked it up you see pictures of women of the islands with like blood red lips from the beetlenut chewing/chewage )\n\nAnyways mom made him make one for him and all his siblings ( not all of which embibed in this stuff ) and then chew it. For a long ass time. Huge ass \"servings\" While this was happening she beat a few of the kids asses like punches and kicks, and then once she got to the culprit it was one of the sickest beat downs with a shoe that ive ever personally seen.\n\nNot the boomerang eddie murphy stand up style beat down. Nope, Beat down like this kid stole your money, killed your dog, burnt your house down, or some other felonious crime youd think. Bruises and lots of \"holy shits\" from me ( said internally as i sort of slowly backed away from the action and just watched in horror )\n\nAfter it was done, everyone went about their business like normal fucking day. \n\nLater on it turns out these beatings happened a lot if the kids stepped out of line, of which there were many, so many many beat downs.\n\nFunny thing is: Samoans and Islanders in general that ive known have always been some of the most Loving, Generous, Honest, Loyal, Friendliest and soft spoken people of which many i consider great and close friends. Ones that would be there in a pinch, always put family first and friends, if youre close enough, were like family. They would do anything for you, and I in turn did the same because people that like that with morals and general ideals are few and far between.\n\nSoft Spoken, but also, when the shit in the fan, some of the biggest islanders i knew were the first to stand up, step in front of me or whoever was being bullied and challenged, and would straight up stomp the shit out of people. And then \"Hey bruh lets go get a beer or some food\" in the sweetest, softest voice youve ever heard.\n\nSo, maybe as a parent im doing it wrong since these kids obeyed their parents like they were the damn KGB or Mossad or something - if they breached the line or protocol, they would get dealt with asap. Almost to the point of going home just to get the ass whooping and get it over with.\n\nGreat people. Weird upbringing violence and even the girls got their asses kicked. But not only being some of the most beautiful girls ive ever seen, they are kick ass people and great friends. Also, they could fight with the best of em, and ive even seen a girl put a guy down with a few quick punches and again.. the group i was with this was normal while the guy who was being a dick and put his hands on the girl while trying to spit some game ( touching, not wanted ) got what he deserved.\n\n**TL;DR**: Islanders will sometimes get the shit beat out of them by the parents for rule breakage or just crossing the many lines set by the parents to the point of oh shit.. holy shit.. like MMA beat downs in public or private, wherever the knowledge of the infraction was learned. That said, they are also some of the best friends, greatest people, faithful, honest, tough, well mannered, and just overall soft spoken and soul filled folks ive ever had the pleasure of meeting in my life and am proud to know a few that i can call friends, if not family.",

They were moving into the smallest house on a farm property. (I think only like 5 of the kids were still living at home, but idk) This house was more of a shack than an actual house. I think maybe 2 small bedrooms upstairs. \nWell, the child in my class had invited me out for a sleepover, I was probably in 5th grade at the time. The house was disgusting. I remember sitting at the table and the mom sat there while we ate with her forehead down on the table the entire time. I was so home sick. But it really got weird when the dad got home…our superintendent. He ate a reheated plate and as he ate, the kids were to bathe. They took turns bathing in the same tub of water…eventually asking if I wanted to take a bath. I’m sure I’ve never shaken my head so fast. I remember seeing the brown water in the very small tub. I was then horrified when the dad/our superintendent went in for his bath and shut the door. The image of what he must have looked like sitting down into a very small tub of brown, cold water scarred me.  Later, the crabby mom was leaving to town and she told us that we had to have the house clean before she got back of I had to go home. (I should have immediately set about the task of making a mess to ensure my ticket HOME!) but for some odd reason, I didn’t. The house was an absolute PIT. I remember one of the older sisters-pushing everything on the floor upstairs-like a bulldozer down the small stairwell, even pushing a mattress over top of it and we were climbing up the stairs without ever actually touching the steps because they were filled with junk and the junk was deep.  I remember her brothers dirty underwear being in there and a sister making him cry stringing them up in the house. We shoved stuff in every nook and cranny we could, literally just hiding everything. I’m certain it looked frightful and that it still was not even passable for “clean” when she got back. I was so scared.  I “got to” stay.   That night, we watched a movie “Interview with the Vampires” I had never watched anything like it and it made me sick to my stomach. The sound and imagine of the vampires sucking the blood from dogs’ necks and tossing them into a pile haunts me to this day.  I also had brought a pillow that was a big Goofy “head”. I remember having it at one point but never saw it again. My mom\nhad even asked them for its yet but they never gave it back. The whole experience  hurts my stomach. It was such a dark, dirty shack and the parents were 100% creepy. Neither every talked directly to me. I felt so uncomfortable and scared the whole time. Why did my mom let me go there?!?",

Our mothers decided to join forces to get us quick snacks for lunch we could eat on the bus on our tight schedule. They took turns and each day one of us would bring lunch. My mother, who is a pretty excellent cook, would get us all sorts of stuff like sandwiches, pies, empanadas and shit. For a whole year, at every single time that he brought lunch, his mother always cooked Kibbeh (middle eastern mix of meat, grain and spice).\n\nOn spring break I briefly visited him and his house was an absolute mess. Dead (and alive) roaches galore, piles of rubbish and broken old tech all around, but what really stuck with me was his desk. The place where he studied had such a thick layer of dust, it was unlike anything I’ve ever seen. It looked like volcanic ash, not dust. And he just acted like that was absolutely normal because “he didn’t have time to clean it up”.\n\nAnd yeah, maybe careless parenting got him there, but he was a really shitty person too. He used to unironically say that his dream was to reach 18 years old, get out of his house and take his father’s old car (an absolutely disgusting, old and broken down Fiat Fiorino), get into a community college and just live on the back of the car on campus.\n\nHis father was still around but he said he’d hoped he would die before he got 18, so he could just take the car.\n\nHe was an elitist prick too. Because he was white, blonde and had blue eyes he would joke about being a neo-nazi and I could never really tell how much he was joking or not.\n\nSpecially because once he hooked up with a darker skinned girl from the college (I’m not saying black because she wasn’t really black, she was more… mixed? That’s more of a thing here in Brazil), and since I took the bus with him i was with them when it happened. After she left he said that he didn’t want me telling anyone he hooked up with an “n-word”\n\nHe used to punch me on the balls if I was standing up on the bus too, just to make others laugh.\n\nA couple of years after school I ran into him again, at this point I was already steady at a good job and in my sophomore year in college. He was still trying to get into the public college. Once he spotted me, he asked me “how I’ve been”. When I started replying he interrupted me and said “Yeah yeah, just pretend I cared for whatever you were saying. Listen, you used to be good at geopolitics… can you explain what’s going on on Syria? I feel like that’s going to be the theme of an essay for college.”\n\nFun guy. Hope things worked out fine for him",

            "text": "I finally have a place to tell these stories. Buckle up, they’re three somewhat connected stories and lengthy. When I was in 5th grade, I got to attend a ‘normal’ school after being homeschooled up until that point. It wasn’t a traditional school though, as it was described as a ‘homeschool co-op’. We attended three days a week: Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8am to 12pm. This is when we did tests and quizzes, were given quick lessons and assigned homework for the time we were at home. Irrelevant details, but necessary only to explain that the majority of students came from similar, exclusively homeschooled beginnings. So ‘normal’ was very, very arbitrary. \n\nMy fifth grade class had three other boys in it besides myself, and it was pretty common that we’d hang out with one another. Occasionally we’d spend the night at each other’s house which led to some rather strange experiences. For the sake of anonymity, we’ll call these three boys: John, Brian and Gary. They each had a different definition of ‘normal’ at their house. \n\nLet’s start with John. John’s mother verbally abused all of the other members of the household while watching soap opera’s all day. She also collected animals like they were charm trinkets and treated all of them better than her husband and two sons. In their house they had a fully stocked 120 gallon salt water aquarium, an iguana, a Boston terrier, three cats, a 70 gallon fresh water aquarium, an African grey parrot that she genuinely cared more about than their youngest son, a ball python, and there was a room upstairs we weren’t allowed in that could have had more animals. Despite yelling at them all constantly, she’d apparently taught them all the importance of collecting. My friend John had, by fifth grade, an incredible Hot Wheels collection that spanned all four walls of his bedroom. Except. They. Were. All. Still. In. Boxes. His mom made a fuss about how I wanted to play with them. Watching her explain that they only retain their value if they were never opened, I got to witness John visibly die a little inside. They were all so accustomed to being yelled at by her, that they were incredibly adept at communicating emotion nonverbally with their eyes and facial expressions. In retrospect, it was more her Hot Wheels collection than it was John’s. *Wherever you are ‘John’, I hope you found an amazing circle of adult friends that helped you learn and value your worth and boundaries.*\n\nNext we have Brian. Now, Brian was the last house I ended up going to. And I only went once. He was the most odd individual I can recall meeting up until that point. By no means was that his fault though. He was awkwardly tall and heavy, and quite clearly hadn’t been taught anything very helpful at home. Everything at his house felt starched, melancholy and yet just a little bit off. It was like the whole family had something colossal they were trying to avoid mentioning. I went to bed and at around 2 am or so I wake up terrified. There is a voice coming from their living room, and the house is completely dark with everyone still presumably sleeping. I shake my friend Brian awake and explain what I hear, he sighs and says ‘That’s a toy.’ Before closing his eyes again and rolling back over. But the voice continues. ‘U-nye-loo-lay-doo…… U-nye-loo-lay-doo…. Do you want to play?!’ So I go investigate. Sitting in their living room under the cover of darkness, nestled midway up their bookcase, sits a softball sized furry creature with its eyes frantically popping open and shut and it’s little beak mouth snapping as it poorly matched the time of its voice box. They had a possessed Furby that they were all completely okay with going off at random times in the middle of the night inviting them to play. *’Brian’, wherever you are in life I hope you found a very tall woman to love and that you found the courage to take your baseball bat and obliterate that demonic toy.*\n\nLast but certainly not least, as far as this discussion goes, we have Gary. Until I spent the night, I thought Gary and his family had it all together. He was cool, well spoken and all the girls loved him. His older sister was absolutely stunning. His family lived in a giant house his dad was building about 10 miles from where we attended school. When I woke up at Gary’s house, I was surprised to see him absent from the room. The door was open so I put the pieces together and followed the sounds of conversation I heard down the hall. ‘Gary’ I call out. ‘I’m in here’ I walk down to an open door where he is standing with his head poking out waving. I catch up and he matter of fact explains that he’s been talking to his mom. Behind him, his mother is in the shower, completely nude as you’d expect in the shower. My eyes must have been the size of saucers because he quickly suggested I go play on his Gameboy while they finished talking. I did, in stunned silence. I had no idea what to say or think. Since though, I’ve seen a few accounts on Reddit relaying similar experiences- that talking to a parent while they’re showering is normal for some. That being said, when Gary finally hollered for me to come back, their entire family was in their parents bed. Gary was 11. His sister was around 14 or 15. They were all under the covers with their faces visible. I just stood in the doorway and chatted briefly, but I was told this is how they start every Saturday and that I’m welcome to join them if I want. Again, my eyes or face probably showed shocking bewilderment, because Gary’s mom didn’t hesitate to explain that I could stay on top of the covers if I wanted. When I still declined, their dad said that he’d be downstairs in a bit to make cinnamon rolls. *I don’t remember being able to tell if they had clothes on in that bed but ‘Gary’ I do hope you aren’t passing the same traditions on to your family.*\n\nTL;DR: **People are bizarre.**\n\nEdit: Removed a space and want to add, my family wasn’t immune. We weren’t allowed any soda, candy only on Saturdays and only two pieces. But if we disobeyed during the week that was the first thing to go. And my parents would have been the poster child examples of advocates of spanking their children AND being completely okay with continuing to upgrade the strength and size of the paddle. It started as wooden spoons that my mother used in the laundry room. They’d easily break because they hat been repeatedly wet. She upgraded to plastic. After a while, those little slaps started to tickle and laughing got me an upgrade. A 12 inch strip of leather the slapped rather smartly against a bare ass. That too started to amuse me though as it was easily dropped as I squirmed around. Next they got a piece of, as memory serves, ‘airline rubber’. I don’t know where that term was coined but it was described as being better than tire rubber because tires have metal running in them. That thing should have been admitted to DHS. NEXT we had a fraternity paddle the size of a baseball bat that my mom found at a garage sale. It left welts.",

I was like no. But fuck yes I was. Tried the play cool and was like let me try on the hood cause I was too big to wear the robe. We go watch tv after and then head off to bed. I was given my own room , at some time in the night the mother awoke me speaking and It was in coherent  so she pulls down her pants squats in the middle of the room and starts pissing. I walk by her pissing and go wake up the daughter. I would like to say this was the last time I stayed the night but I lived in a abusive home and even though I was underage my mother kicked me out. They took me in no questions were extremely nice. Daughter ended up beating me with an iron and sprayed me with raid because she thought I took her last cigarette. I went to live in a group home . The girl called about a week later and apologize for it as it had rolled off her desk and was on the floor by the wall. Left a voicemail as I never spoke to them again.

The dad took the snake out and poked it in my face, me being terrified of snakes at the time backed up against the wall and must have refused to stroke it about 20 times. Went upstairs, more fucking animals in cages. Went to her room, felt a bit like she was trying to set up a threesome, it got uncomfortable.\n\nWe ended up just going to a shopping centre and the fat lad kindly paid for my food (was a really kind guy) and after the girl left we were just like \"what the fucking shit was all that at her house???\"",

            "text": "This is about an old friend of mine. In 1996, I went to my friend’s home who was one of my closest friend that time. He was alone at home. Our plan was to go out to see other friends. What surprised me was he wanted me to wait as he was cooking food for his family. (This is weird considering he was just 11 years old and you never expect a boy of that age to cook in our culture). Upon further questioning, he told me that he cooks food every day. He had an elder brother who was 13 years old that time. I asked about his brother and he told me that he doesn’t cook. As time passed, I noticed that his elder brother was the favourite child of his parents. I knew my friend was always a trouble maker, naughty kid and I thought this being the reason for his parents behaviour. His parents always treated me as their son. Especially his mother always wanted him to stay close with me as I was one of the bright student in school. We were the best friends and the whole school knew about it. In 2000 we both left our home and moved to a school in a new city. (He was allowed to go out because his parents trusted me). We were sharing a room in the hostel. But after 6 months, he went back home as he had problem adjusting to the place and his mother wanted him close. During this time, our friendship eventually ended because of some petty stuff. We had no contact after 2001. Later, he finished his high school and got admitted to a good college. Although we were not in talking terms but we had lot of common friends and I would get updates about him from friends quite often. He was a bright kid and was very good in studies. But after 2003, he got involved in local mob thing. He would take money from people to do their dirty job. By 2005 he was leader of a local gang. Still things were looking in control. But in 2006, he murdered a man (this deceased man had taken money from somebody and was not returning. So my friend was paid to extort the money from him. During altercation my friend stabbed this man several times). He was suppose to finish his college that year but he did not finish and was underground for 2 years. No one had any info about him. Finally, in 2008, he joined social media. After the murder, he left country illegally (in a ship container) and made it to Bahrain. He added me in social media which I accepted. We just had a 2 line chat that time. I wanted to stay away from him and never spoke to him after that. Later he left Bahrain and moved to Russia in 2015.\n\nIn 2018, finally a mutual friend told me his entire story. So his parents were not his real parents apparently. His real father was youngest of 3 brothers. When he was just 3 months old his father died in a road accident. As his mother was still very young, his father’s eldest brother adopted him and his mother was forcefully remarried. And he was always treated differently by his step family. He was treated well but he was always asked to do house hold jobs. My friend was never made aware of this fact till 2003. I am not sure how he got the information, but since then he hated his step family. He also went and confronted his natural mother in 2004 and for some reason he hated her too. And that’s when he got involved with all bad stuff. In 2005 his step father came to visit him but he disowned his father and went on ranting against the family. \n\nI never had any soft corner for him after he committed the murder but still I wonder why he did what he did. In 2019, I visited his parents. It was tough to see his mother. Years of crying had made her unrecognisable. She told me one thing that I would never forget. “If you had stayed friends with him, he would have never taken the path that he took.”\n\nAnd finally my 2 line chat in 2008\n\nMe: Hope you remember your old friend. \nHim: How can I forget you my best friend. I wish we were still friends. \nMe: I wish.",

I go through the pleasantries and we start watching a movie with my boyfriend sitting in between the sister and I. I start to notice over the course of the movie that anytime they touch each other their hands linger for just a beat too long, and whenever one makes a comment about the movie the other playfully makes fun or makes a lewd joke. Now if that's not weird enough, I'm sitting there on the couch feeling like a third wheel when the sister slips her shoes off and places them in my boyfriend's lap. She moves her feet around on his crotch before whining that he owes her a foot rub \"for earlier\" and they share an amused look. He obliges and after he's done she snuggles up to him, leaning her head on his shoulder. The whole experienced grossed me out, I shortly after asked why he and his sister were so touchy and he got real defensive and tried to justify it all as normal sibling behaviour.",

Going with the theme of this being a memory from childhood I'll stick to the bizarre shit I saw as a child.\n\n5. As a highschool kid I had a friend named \"Lacey\". I went over to her house the first time and everything in the house was hers. Like this teenager lived completely alone in a three bedroom house and everything was like super curated mid-century modern. It wasn't until the third time I came over did I discover her incredibly old grandparents in a downstairs (basement) duplex where she care took them. \n\n4. Again in highschool I visited a friend named \"Tyler\" who was basically a drug dealer (weed.) His mom came from her Nightshift as an ER nurse and turned on the outside flood lamps and started rototilling the garden at 1 am. He was like \"Mom not tonight I have a friend over...\" Turned out his mother was a methamphetamine addict.\n\n3. Went over to a neighbour kids house when I was like nine. Her parents put on a horror movie for us to watch and then did cocaine off an end table and went in their room and fucked incredibly loudly and would occasionally yell at us from the other room to turn the volume up.\n\n2. Went to a highschool friends house at 14. The house was pretty clean. His room was insane. Like three feet of random hoarder shit, a guitar and amp and a mattress floating on top. He just slept like that. Every night.\n\n1. Went to a girlfriends house for the first time. She lived in a pull trailer with an absentee lumberjack father. But it wasn't like a legally placed structure just something hidden on a dirt path off the highway surrounded by bushes. No water. No electricity.

When I became a teenager I started being invited indoors, upon reflection I think it’s weird a young child was never invited indoors until I was like 14/15 but now I know why.\n\nShe shared a bedroom with her sister who was the same age as my sister, my sister was friends with her sister. Seemed nice because like sometimes we would all hang out together. Her mum was a massive hippy and I loved that house because it was decorated with gorgeous pictures of the two girls up the staircase and yellow walls and rugs and decorations everywhere! So it was really pretty but also clean.\n\nAnyways, I remember one time we’d come home from school and go to her house and hang out in her bedroom listen to music or whatever and I’d go home. The friend would try to solicit me into doing sexual acts with her at this time and I would be like no im good like can we just listen to music and dress up or something… Yano? \n\nAnother time we were watching tv in her living room and her mum walks into the kitchen, I hear her turn on the hob and then turn it off again, her eldest daughter walks in (at this time she’s like 18/19) and starts shouting at her and then asks me to go home. So I do.\n\nAnother time the daughter who I’m friends with has a house party so we’re like 16/17 at this time and I’m walking into the kitchen to see the two arguing with the mum, and the eldest daughter crying saying “mum please please stop I just want you to stop” and turns out her mum was shooting heroine this whole time and this is the first time I’d seen someone take it. And it was dark like the youngest daughter was so numb to it all and would be like I just don’t see why it’s a big deal? And the eldest was (rightly so) really upset about the whole ordeal.\n\nAfter I saw this I spoke to my sister about it and apparently the youngest was being molested by her mums boyfriend, the eldest knew about this because she caught him doing it one time. And the mum had been abusing drugs for years, and my sister tried to talk to the eldest about it and get her help but Yano those things are always complicated.\n\nI always think about this family and how I used to go play sims with the youngest in the summer and we used to go wild swimming all the time, like we were close. And now the two sisters don’t speak much, the eldest is the caretaker for the youngest only son because she started abusing drugs herself. Really sad :( I wish things worked out differently for them. \n\nMy sister and the eldest are friends again though and the eldest pretty much moved out after the party and started a family of her own.

He charged right at me and said \"Lupo! Did I step on your hand?\" Dead serious and hella worried that he had. I just looked at the position of both my hands and said nah, lol. That woulda been wild af if you had though. \n\nLater that night he asked us for some mushrooms and acid. We obliged because well it was his house and we were selling out of there. He was always drunk off coffee brandy, and always cracked out. We added mushrooms and acid to the list.\n\nHe smoked some weed with us and sat on an ottoman against the window. Then just leaned back for some reason and went right through the window back first. Took the curtains down in the process which I think saved him some nasty cuts because of never wore a shirt. \n\nIt was an upstairs apartment but he landed on the front porch balcony so not a huge deal. He'd always be on some wild ass shit though. Come out the restroom asking it his hair was on fire, or if those were snakes on the back porch. Literally in the middle of town, no snakes for miles. The back porch was upstairs like how tf you think snakes could get up there bro?\n\nI got so many fucking stories about that dude I could go on all night.

She then does her hair and makeup and all that completely naked in the bathroom with him. I saw this because, for whatever reason, this family did not believe in closing the bathroom door, like almost ever.

Future frat boy types. Upper middle class with some rich kids sprinkled in. Host kid is a recent-marriage stepson of a chiropractor. His mom was a trashy milf before we knew that word in the early 90s. Anyway.. we start to arrive and we're bullshitting around their place and making plans for mischief for the night. Host assures us that we can do whatever we want because his mom and stepdad are going out on a nighttime bicycle ride all night. \n\nNope. That's not what was going down at all.\n\nThe parents came out in full blown BDSM slave gear. Leather daddy zippers and shit.  Stepdad didn't have the head part fully zipped up, but mom was being led by a leash. Right in front of us. He said a few kind words instructing us to behave for the night, and then led mom to the car and drove off. \n\nAfter a moment of stunned silence, we then had a big group argument about WTF we just saw. Host, who thought this was perfectly normal, assured us that it was just a biking thing. We didn't know everything, but we knew enough to call bullshit on that. But a half hour later, it was behind us and we proceeded with normal tween boy stuff playing night wars outside in the woods/yard.\n\nEdit:  For those asking, \"night wars\" is probably a weird term, but it's what we used. Basically it was a catch-all term for tween boys running around the neighborhood unsupervised all night. Usually the boys would separate into groups of various sizes or sometimes just divide in half. We would play games or pranks or just go exploring in the woods. Water balloon fights.. toilet papering houses/yards.. egging mailboxes.. paintball fights.. I could probably think of more. A \"night wars\" night would be declared in advance and then we would work out the details (or not) later. This was the late 80's/early 90's in a small town with basically zero crime, if that helps clarify why a bunch of kids would be allowed to roam around all night like that.",

I was raised in a house where dogs are family. My friend and his family didn't seem fazed at all.\n\nEdit: This really took off, so I guess I can elaborate a little more. This happened around 1994. I grew up in an extremely rural town, so when I say my friend lived deep in the woods, I'm talking like they were completely off the grid backwoods. One of the dogs was my friend's and the other was his sister's. They were chained up outside 24/7 and just not treated as pets at all. I believe the logic behind the shooting was that the sister's dog was too injured to recover, and my friends dog had  killed his sister's dog. So it was only fair to shoot them both. About 30 minutes after the whole thing happened, we all ate dinner together like nothing happened. My parents picked me up shortly after, and I cried the entire way home.

            "text": "I've got one from the opposite perspective\n\nSo to paint the picture\n\nI invited a few people over for my 10th birthday party, the plan was a sleep over with video games and board games. Sounded great to my nerdy friends and I.\n\nWell the day of the party comes along and one of my friends gets dropped off by the school bus with me, we walk inside and there's no pizza yet and the cake hasn't been picked up. I ask my dad and he starts screaming about how my Mom will pick them up on her way from work. She won't be home until 7pm at the earliest and my friends will be arriving around 4pm.\n\nAfter my friend and I left the room my friend (from now referred to as Mark(not his name)) asked me if something is a wrong and why my dad was so mad. It was normal for him to be that mad when he forgot something.\n\nThe rest of my friends show up around 4pm (friends Bill, Bob, and Frank (also not their names), I offer them fruit snacks when they arrive and tell them pizza should be there around 7:30pm.\n\nSo we're taking turns on Gran Turismo 4 when Bill asks if my parents are home, he'd like to meet them. I tell him that my dad's home but he's sleeping right now as he gets up kinda early (this was a lie, he was taking his \"medicine\" ((what I'd later (that evening) find out was heroin) and would be occupied for awhile) and my Mom would be getting out of work around 7pm (which was true). The lie seemed to work and we continued playing games.\n\n8pm rolls around and my Mom gets home. She has no pizza or cake. I greet when she comes into the living room.\n\nShe asks us if we ate the pizza and cake already, I tell her that dad told us she'd be getting them. She asked where my dad was so I told her their bedroom.\n\nShe said she'd be right back and went to their bedroom. It wasn't long before you could here them (clearly) screaming at each other.\n\nI noticed them arguing was making my friends uncomfortable but I was unfazed. It was them that I realized that what was going on wasn't normal. I felt awful.\n\nI told my friends that my parents would likely be arguing most of the night and if they wanted to go home I'd understand. They all wanted to go home.\n\nDue to the layout of the home the kitchen was closer to the bedrooms than the living room and that was where the phone was. So I went with each of my friends to the kitchen so they could call their parents to be picked up. The front door was also closer still.\n\nThey each took turns calling their parents, I had to talk to Frank's parents for him as he was too shaken by what was going on.\n\nAll the parents were there within the hour and picked up my friends. Mark was the last one to be picked up and asked if I wanted to hang out as his place for the night. I told him that if my parents found out I left without telling anyone, especially if I didn't leave a note saying where, they'd be even more angry. And I told him that I couldn't leave a note saying where I was going as I didn't want to have his parents dragged into it.\n\nWe hugged and he left.\n\nMy parents finished screaming at each other around 11pm when my dad left screaming about going to his buddies place for the weekend.\n\nI was reading a book in the living room when my mom walked in and saw that everything was put away and all my friends were gone. She asked me where they went.\n\nI'll never forget the pain in her eyes when I said they each called their parents and went home already.\n\nFor what I thought was normal, I thought everyone's parents argue endlessly. I thought everyone had a parent that they lied for. I thought everyone's parents lies to them constantly. I thought everyone's parents got angry at them without prompting.\n\nI thought everyone always looked for exits upon entering a new place.\n\nI thought everyone knew how to act without being seen.\n\nI thought everyone knew how to act under pressure.\n\nI haven't celebrated a birthday since. Or even tried. I feel no drive to celebrate it as all it does is remind me of that and many other horrible things around that time.\n\nI'm still friends with Mark all these years later, he's my one of my only friends and he's by far my closest friend.",

I had a sheet blocking my area from the laundry area. It had bare concrete walls, wood beams and piping across the ceiling and cement flooring. Used a heater and dehumidifier cause it was cold and humid. When I used the heater my parents would make my sheeted area around my bed so it would heat up the space quicker. Parents didn’t allow any of my friends over and my brother and sister weren’t allowed in my room. Distant family members also never stayed over and when we had family gathering, I was told to go into the guest room instead of my room while they were there. I thought cool, I have a huge room and no one can mess it up. My family would go on vacations yearly without me from when I was 12 till I was 18. I was the dog and house watcher. During one of those vacations when I was 17 I invited a friend come over. They pointed out how fucked up it was that there were bedrooms fully furnished with TVs for my brother and sister, a guest room fully furnished as well with a tv, and how I was in the basement with sheets for walls and bathroom mats on the floor. I completely dismissed it cause it was normal to me. It wasn’t till I was 20 that I found out that the family trips that I didn’t go on were paid for with money that I was getting from my dad passing away. I’m sure I got some of the money in food and clothes and whatever I needed. But it’s got me pretty fucked up cause my brother and sister don’t have any memory of it and when I talk about it they always back my parents by saying we were raised right and I opted out of vacations.

Anyway, downstairs was an interesting layout, they had a room that was almost hidden away that you could easily miss unless you knew it was there or noticed it from outside. So, this room, I only ever went in once, maybe twice in many years of being friends and going over their house quite a lot, it was their \"Christmas room\" it has decorations up all year round, and during the year when they bought presents they'd wrap them and just put in the room and leave them there until Christmas.\n\nIt was awesome in a sense though, a whole room for this is great, often when it came to Christmastime they'd forgotten what something was that they got for another family member.\n\nEDIT: Reading the rest of the thread, this is so tame and boring compared to the dog fucking mother or the cake in soup one.\n\nEDIT2: Thank you to every one for the upvotes, nice to see it's still getting read.

She was a first generation immigrant to the US, whose parents came to the New England area from Ireland.  My two younger brothers and I spent a lot of time at her home and I was generally the oldest child there. \n\nWhen I was about 8 years old, she started to have me make her her favorite drink. Gin and tonic. She drank these ALL DAY, while running her home daycare.  At age 8 I knew...how to mix cocktails, that forks were better for stirring than spoons, and that large plastic bottles of gin were cheap and low quality.  \n\nThis went on for years, on pretty much a daily basis, until my family moved out west.   My Godmother kept her daycare running until she died (I'm sure of health problems relating to alcohol).  I was 15 when she passed and I'm in my 30's now. I honestly went most of my life thinking NOTHING of it until I became a father a couple of years ago.   At which point I was like... \"How the fuck did anyone let her have a daycare?\"  \n\nSide note, I drink but would consider myself an average drinker, if not below average.  With that being said, I could never stomach the thought of gin and didn't try gin until I was 30. This was because I once licked my finger, early in my daycare bartending career, after a couple of drops of gin splashed on my hand as I was pouring.  That plastic-half-gallon quality gin was the worst thing I'd ever had in my life and I had no idea how my Godmother liked it so much.  Complete ruined my taste for gin...at 8.",

You'd think normal nuclear family....  Well, one summer day, my friend and I (both 12) were invited to swim in the Gilbert's pool, along with my little sister and the two daughters.  Linda was sunbathing, oblivious to what was going on. My sister and the girls were being kids.  When Dick comes up behind both my friend and me and......  gets creepy.  To this day, it's the oddest vision.  I'm watching my sister laugh and play while this freak is groping us both.  Dick eventually started an affair with Mikey's mom.  I babysat Mikey.  Young boy with leukemia.   Eventually the Gilbert's divorced.  He married Mikey's mom.  And, they moved!!!!  Things that happen in middle class suburbs no one talks about.",

Two houses down were some neighbor kids: a 16yo boy, and 11yo girl, an 8yo girl, and a 5yo and 6yo boy. Needless to say, we all became quick friends and hung out together. They invited me and my nephew over for dinner one night and their mom said my older sister should come too so the families could get to know one another. When we went over there we found out that not only did their mom & dad not sleep in the same bed, their mom slept on the couch with her lesbian lover that was like their 3rd co-parent. Now this was a shock to my young self in and of itself because I'd never met gay people before, let alone a 3 parent sort of situation (not judging now, just stating that it was strange to me then), but also because both the dad and the lesbian couple were hard-core flirting with my sister in front of us all in ways even my nephew recognized. My sister was super not into it and creeped out so we all left after dinner even though the kids wanted us to spend the night. We still played in the cul-de-sac with the kids after that but my sister tried to avoid these swingers at all cost lol",

During week 2, one of the other counselor’s brothers came to camp and brought their family tradition: smashing sandwiches. \n\nThe rules go as listed: \n\n1) To smash someone else’s food, it must be a sandwich. A sandwich to them is any food between two other foods that are identical. \n\n2) you cannot smash someone’s sandwich unless they have taken at least one bite. \n\n3) when you are not eating it, you can put an object on the sandwich (such as a napkin or utensil) and it’s safe. \n\n4) you can remove this object but then cannot smash the sandwich but someone else can. \n\n5) if you can persuade anyone to remove the object then you are free to smash it but the other person cannot. \n\nBack home, her whole family did this whenever they ate together. Then that tradition spread to a camp of 300 kids. That was a fun week.",

His older sister had some definite psychological and mental issues, she was extremely possessive of him (BF) and at least once that I know of, she tried to seduce him…her brother.   It was extremely fucked up. \n\nTheir house was on a golf course, huge, expensive…but crammed with crap. They had entire rooms they couldn’t use because of the hoarding his mother did. His father openly and creepily flirted with me, a 16-18 year old girl. One time, after I left their house, my BF got into a fight with his mother and called her a bitch (deservedly so). His father took him outside and punched him several times. He had a black eye and bruises. He and his dad got into physical shoving matches in front of me. His mom would routinely slap him in front of me, and while he was at work (he worked for her). Don’t get me wrong, I was VERY used to physical abuse at home, but not in front of guests and definitely not in public. \n\nHis mother ended up screaming at me on the phone when I was a freshman in college and I never spoke to her again. The bf ended up being a complete abusive POS, but it’s not very hard to see why. He’s an adult and responsible for his actions, but man he had a rough upbringing.\n\nETA: dad was a raging alcoholic and, even better, commercial airline pilot.

After a trip to the pharmacy and then McDonald’s we drive to the rural town In Louisiana where there’s all these busted shacks and abandoned homes. He pointed out his home which was a very nice modular home with a wood deck and manicured lawn. Really looked out of place for the area. But we pulled into the drive way across the street from his place which was a house with a partially collapsed roof and bare wood siding because all the paint had peeled off over the years. He says come on let’s go in. We go in and the place is like a scene from hoarders. Just random junk everywhere. And the place smelled moldy and dusty. We made our way to the bedroom where a morbidly obese man and his wife were laying In What seemed to be a california king sized bed. The woman was on oxygen and the man obviously had severe diabetes because his feet and ankles were a dark color. A blue tarp hung from the ceiling to catch rain water and I shit you not the tarp hung down so low it was like a foot away from touching their heads. The friend and I literally had to duck down so we could speak face to face with them. So he gave them their food and medicine and he talked a little and offered to try to fix the tarp. They declined and stated someone was supposed to come later and help them with it. But they stayed in that bed full of old fast food wrappers and filth with a tarp next to their heads like it was nothing. As if this was how life was supposed to be. Never even said excuse the mess. It was awful. When we left my friend explained that if no one helps them out they have a hard time getting their meds and other things.

When they see it theyll just leave it for days till it hardens because its easier to pick up and they dont clean where the poo was… the sink was over-filled with dishes that theyd eventually just throw out (they ordered out every night anyway) and they had fly catchers everywhere. There is bird seed everywhere and they never clean the cages. The dogs were almost always kept in a decently large cage/area outside that was also never cleaned out or washed. \n\nI felt so bad that i commonly would clean out the water bowls and fill them with my bottled water while my friend was busy doing something else at home. They always went on vacation every month or two but would have letters on letters from collections for debts but went anyway and my friend was always borrowing money from people.\n\n I met them in highschool and by then it was too “normal” to them already even if they accepted it wasnt right. i tried for years to help them with the habit even cleaning their house out when i was asked to watch the animals while they were gone but the day theyd get back the dogs always already soiled everything and the family would just start leaving trash in the newly cleaned areas. The house is a two bedroom and can barely hold the animals let alone humans and every inch of the house is covered in nick nacks like a hoarder would have except when asked they would call everything trash and give none of it any sentimental value either. \n\nWhen i asked why they didnt just throw it out theyd always say “theres too much to go out at once” even when id offer to help then theyd say “i have to look through everything first” even though pointing ar individual things theyd easily call each garbage. I tried for years to help them kick the habit but once i realized this was never ending when my friend started bringing/leaving trash all over when theyd come to my house and doing things like throwing wrappers, food and garbage on my floor. \n\nIt makes me sad because i know my friends parents did that to them and if they weren’t also a pathological liar and manipulative person id probably still be trying to help them eliminate this behavior but i have too big of trust issues to have someone like that in my life anymore. There were rats (not mice) living inside of their walls and i feel like thats the only reason they didnt have roaches… I honestly hope this persons life turns out okay but i cant be around any of that anymore",

There were 4 older teens in there, 2 standing in the tub, two others standing by the counter. They had the medicine cabinet mirror on the tile with a bunch of lines of coke. I was scared shitless and they said I had to do a line to show I was cool and wouldn't narc on them. I pulled the fastest line out of my ass and said I can't, I have a heart condition. One of the guys decided I was \"cool\" and they flung me back out the door. My friend who's the same age as me was completely unphased.

There was no Cable but they had a pretty large disney collection all in english, the younger son kept going at us and his dad just excused him by saying \"hes going to become a marine\" the food was so strange and tasteless.

            "text": "Went to spend the night with some friends from church. Very nice family. They were unquestionably the most religious bunch I've ever seen. Old world shit. I noticed that the mom and daughter always wore skirts at church and thought maybe that was a church thing but that was 100% of the time. No TV or other \"heathen media\", if it wasn't print media from a \"respectable\" religious source it got tossed into the fireplace.\n\nBasically, everything was a wonky ass goofball rule of some form. Only reading permitted was to be religious in nature. No drinks at the table during mealtime. (The mom saw that as an insult to the cooking to have a drink on the table to \"wash the taste out of your mouth\".) No talking at the table. \"Grace\" was to be said, in turn, starting from the father at the head of the table clockwise, with each eater having to recite some form of prayer, and if yours wasn't up to snuff you got sent away from the table and didn't get to eat. When the matriarch (she sat to his right side and went last) said her amen to her prayer, that's the last talking at the table. No salt or pepper shakers at the table because that was seen as an insult to the cooking. Water or wine were only acceptable drinks because that's all Jesus had. I was kinda stoked to have my first taste wine but they never brought that out so I just got water only. Goddammit.\n\nKids were expected to communicate very specifically. \"Yes mother\" \"No father\" \"Thank you sister\" \"You're welcome brother\". Etc. Failure to maintain this was grounds for \"a dose\" which I soon discovered was a hard thwack on the knuckles with a metal ruler.\n\nOther disciplinary measures were in full force. Youngest son broke some wacky ass rule and was disciplined. He was leaned against the end of the couch, pants lowered, tighty whitey's lowered, and an appropriate number of strikes on the bare ass with a belt. Everyone else expected to observe as additional humiliation. (I was torn on this. The 13 year old boy side of my mind was like \"Ooh, wonder if things change when it's a girl? Will I see Rachel's magnificent buns if she fucks up?\" \\[Rachel was 17 and had that hourglass figure thing going on strong\\] My humanitarian side was like \"forced nudity in front of a kid you barely know? That's not right, even if it's just your butt\") Either way, I took much more interest in the rules and made damn sure I didn't break one. I sincerely don't think I'd have been given a pass. I wasn't given a pass for not referring to the patriarch as Sir once and didn't get a pass on getting \"a dose\" of the ruler. Sumbitch.\n\nBasically, they're the reason therapy can be lucrative. If you take an elite military force and get them all jacked up on Jesus juice, that's how that house was run. It was a lot like stepping into a little isolation box where the rules outside are irrelevant because the house runs in a different realm.",

Literally had the needles on the table. Dwayne just walked on through like it was normal. I was in complete shock, knowing this kid the same age as me. Doing so great comes home to that everyday. \n\nI move after sophomore year back to Illinois. Graduate there and go back to visit my family and friends in Arkansas. Linked up with Dwayne, he was a volunteer firefighter, never did start college. We went over to his house where he had 2 roommates. They all three were into some hard drugs. They were all banging needles and I just didn’t know quite what to do besides to not do that.\n\nWell Dwayne got a call from the station and he needed to get there. He couldn’t, unable to properly function his friend (can’t say a name). Offered him some meth to get him up and alert. Of course he took it, he walked out the door and fell flat. The speedball killed him, heart exploded. No response.\n\nI left, I wasn’t going to be apart of it and ruin my life. Never talked to any of those people again.

I went over to a friend's house, he actually wasn't my friend but was a close friend of someone I know.  The guy was 18 or 19.  I was assisting him with a project on his computer that was somewhat clandestine in nature (It did not involve pornography or sexuality in any way) but he needed some help and I could assist.   I won't say what it is, but lets say \"up to no good\" and \"victimless crime\" but definitely not the type of thing you would be cool with your kids doing in the living room.   \n\n\nHis parents didn't seem to care that we were working on this project in their living room.  His sister came home, I don't remember from where or what the issue was, but she was a senior or junior at the time and it had something to do with Prom or something.   To me, it was like a non issue.  Something about friends coming over or something.   The entire family erupts into a violent argument.   Like, over nothing.   All with me in the living room.   His dad and sister are yelling at each other in another room and as she is getting her spiel in, I just hear this incredibly loud CLAP noise.  I thought the dad clapped his hands together really loudly.  Nope.  He smacked the shit out of her.   She just starts crying.    \n\n\nI can't recall the exact order of this, he might have done this before the dad smacked the sister.  But he goes in the room and just starts yelling at her \"FUCK YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS! I AM GOING TO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF THE NEXT FUCKING FRIEND OF YOURS THAT YOU BRING OVER HERE\" to his sister.  \n\nI remember asking him \"Hey man, should I leave?\" \"Nah man. You are cool. \" then \"Dude... Did he hit your sister?\" \"Well, you know, she made him mad\"  \n\n\nI mean.  I have seen parents get into an argument.  But usually there was some reason and it was sort of contained as an argument and usually never done around guests.  This was like a nothing.  This was the type of thing that is really just settled as a calm conversation but it erupted into a total war with these people. \n\nHere we are sitting there, doing something that no reasonable parents would allow people to do in their living room, and then they were blowing up and going to war over things that I thought were like, nothing.  \n\nA while later I asked the mutual person we know about the family and he was like \"OH yeah, they do that.  They blow up over the smallest thing and it becomes this huge volatile family fight\".",

My parents split when I was 14 and my younger brother (11) and I went with our mom but we lived in the same area until I graduated high school so I didn't have to switch schools.\n\nI think I was 16 or 17 and I think we were celebrating my brothers birthday. Our cousins and my brother's friends were with us and for some reason, we decided to walk over to my father's house. I was convinced he wouldn't answer the door because I had tried to visit him recently and he didn't answer the door when I knocked but this time, he not only answered the door. He invited all of us (6-ish teenagers) inside. I should note here that he was wearing a bathrobe.\n\nMy father had a drinking problem for as long as I could remember. Idk if he still drinks because we don't really talk. But it was clear once we got inside and started talking with him that he was not sober. I wanted to leave, but my cousins thought it was funny and stayed.\n\nMy cousins start teasing him about not being on social media (everyone was migrating from MySpace to Facebook around this time). They tell him they found someone they thought was him, but that the person they saw was dressed like Captain Underpants. \n\nMy father: \"that couldn't have been me because I'm not even wearing underwear!\" Then he opened his robe flasher style. I looked away, but I found out later from someone who didn't react as quickly as I did that he had a towel on under his robe, but still. We didn't stay too long after that. We all laughed it off and shared it as a funny story later, but I've been realizing lately how fucked up parts of my childhood were.",

But some were for other reasons. For a while they were very interested in sound systems. They would put big speakers, amplifiers and other stuff that would make your brain rotate inside your skull into their cars. After a while they would almost without fail catch fire. Whenever something broke down or got burned they just moved it further back into their yard. And then they would get another one. When they were taken off the road they became storage. All of the cars (usually vans and station wagons) were completely full of all kinds of junk. They also had a 5x5 meter 2 story storage building at the end of their yard.  Not surprisingly all of this was also shock full of seemingly random stuff just piled on top of each other. The inside of their house had more space to walk around, but it also looked almost like a poorly organized storage facility. They never ate at any of their tables because they were always full of various stuff. And no matter where you looked, piles and bags full of random objects were filling every nook and cranny. The weirdest thing about it was that adult VHS tapes and CD roms were hidden all over the house. Ranging from the 1970s up until the present day (late 90s early 00s). During the last year I visited them my friend had started keepin his clothes on the floor. Because he would rather keep his magazine collection in the closet.\n\nAnother guy I went to school with had a very strict mom. One time he had a friend over after school he had asked if the friend wanted a glass of soda. After they were finished drinking they had to wash the glasses, dry them off and put them back in the closet in the exact same way as they found them.

Anyway, that kid, I forgot his name, told us we should go to his place before we headed out of the city to pick up some money so we drove to his parent's house, went inside and met his parents for the first time. His parents were much older than our parents, they must have gotten him at a very late age because to sixteen years old me they looked really old. After some greetings and introducing us to his parents the kid immediately tells his dad \"Give me XXX amount of money\", and the dad told him he could get some money but not as much as he asked for and that kid flips out and hits his dad, he actually punched his dad in the face and started screaming at his dad to give him the money, punching him a few times more. It was immediately clear to my friend and me  that this guy was terrorizing his parents, we were both extremely chocked and bailed out of that place, we never spoke to that guy anymore and he probably understood we didn't like him because he never approached us after that incident either altough we all went to the same school.",

Explained a lot of her “quirks” I just ignored like never throwing away trash or just leaving uneaten food in my room for hours without asking to if it should go in the trash or the sink since she was done with the meals so I ended up always cleaning king after she left.\n\nLiterally swatting off multiple flies while I stood still and heard the hum of them like some sick orchestra killed all interest for her on the spot. Dropped off the books at her local library with a note that it was for X, left a text and said I wasn’t interested. I almost threw up after leaving and somehow still had a fly or two sneak it’s way into my car that wouldn’t leave even with the windows down and the AC blasting on full.\n\nNot ever going to be classist, but if someone is ok living in filth, in my experience (had a streak a bad luck in dating) they’ll have no problem bringing it into your own place",

(she'd take me with her for sympathy to get more shit) I always felt bad for my dad as he'd be the one dealing with her lies n shit.

We were all HUGE fans of Nintendo. We'd talk about it all day long, pretend to be characters, discuss characters and strategies. These boys seemed to have loads of games and knew everything about them. Their mum was a stay-at-home mum, and their dad repaired or restocked coffee vending machines. \n\nOne day, a weekday I think, in the summer holiday, I was finally invited in to their house to play Nintendo and have dinner. The house was a mess, threadbare carpets jumping with cat fleas, animal hair all over, cigarette ash and ends everywhere, rubbish piled up. They had one TV in the house (not unusual for the time or economic status of the area) but their obese mother was sat on the sofa watching her *shows*, like ALL AFTERNOON, the boys, it turned out, knew so much about the games because they'd sit on the flea covered carpet all day studying the manuals. So that's what we did for the whole time I was there until we eventually got about half an hour on the Nintendo (which had been left on, paused since god knows when the last time they'd played it) while she prepared dinner. Hashbrowns, chips and something else beige. Maybe beans too, I'm not sure. Standard council tea of the time. The boys were obviously spoilt with gifts though, because they had loads of games, I just have no idea when they got any time to play them because their mum had monopolistic control of the television. \n\nNow here's the actually weird part: for a \"treat\" (and the whole family would constantly get up and go and do this), we'd be allowed to go and scoop some hot chocolate powder out of the open jumbo bag of vending machine hot chocolate powder that was left against a wall in the living room (alongside mum's more-or-less permanent station on the sofa). It was super sweet and you'd accidentally inhale it into your lungs, coughing it out in big clouds of sweet, chocolatey powder, and get it all over your face scooping it in. Oh, and the lumps! There were these sticky, gooey lumps in the bay where clammy hands had constantly been double-dipped in the powder. Lovely... I wonder what ever happened to that family..?",

I neither asked for nor wanted it, but I said thank you, took a sip, and put it down, probably visibly unsure of what to do with it. Friends dad “corrected” me and handed the cup to his son/my friend, who took a sip and passed it back to the father, who then took a sip and passed it back to me. We stood there drinking this giant, unsolicited coke for 10 minutes, one sip at a time. It wasn’t harmful in any kind of way, but I’ve been thinking of how weird that seemed to me for 20+ years.

The letter was written for me and in that letter the girl wrote about how much she wanted to do dirty stuff with me, my mom didn't tell me everything she wrote in detail but told me that the girl was weirdly specific of what she wanted to do with me the next time I went over.

She’d just open up to me about how she never wanted kids and this wasn’t what she wanted in her life etc. \n\nMe and the gf broke up shortly after going off to college, and her parents divorced almost immediately after that. I often wondered if my “counseling” (or lack of at that point) caused that. \n\nFrom what I understand, the children cut off all contact with their mother after the divorce.",

The son also happened to be my older brothers bff so it wasn’t like they were strangers…\n\nThe mom was genuinely obsessed with me. She wanted a daughter so bad and I was the ballet/pink/pretty-everything/girly girl. She had three boisterous boys. I spent most of that entire week just listening to her talk about how wonderful it was to have a girl in the house. She doted on me, we had “girls dates” we got our hair done and nails done. It was way too much for socially-anxious-and-awkward me! Younger was exempt from this because there was never any doubt that was a boy stuck in a girls body! Now as I’ve been TTC for years I can understand just getting carried away in the joy of loving a child, but it made me feel very awkward. \n\nThe part that still creeps me out, though… The dad was in charge of bedtime. Younger sister (who is now my younger brother) and I were sharing a room as we’re both girls (at the time). He sent all of us to bed at 7pm. He wanted us sleeping by 7:30pm. It was still daylight!! Here it comes: He insisted on reading the girls bedtime stories. Loooooong bedtime stories. So here I was, summer before freshman year, laying in bed while this man reads me a fairy tale. He tells me to close my eyes so I can fall asleep while he’s reading. As if that could happen, remember: I’m captain of the varsity anxiety squad! So I’m laying awkwardly on my back and he started asking me a bunch of questions about “Is that how you sleep? On your back?” And he demanded that I roll over and lay like I do when I’m sleeping…. \n\n\nThere was no physical touching, but I am still so completely creeped out. Like, there’s something going on in a dudes head to read a 12yo girl bedtime stories and discuss the way she is laying in her bed, right?!",

We had these creaky old stairs that came down in almost a spiral. Like four steps then 90 degree turn, times three. And you could always tell who was coming down them by the footsteps. That particular morning dad hid at the bottom of the stairs waiting for my sister to plod down, when unfortunately poor 10yo friend got a \"Haaiiiia\" straight to he face. Dad just walked away like nothing had happened and I think my poor sister's friend was a bit too stunned to react. \nWe still laugh about this nearly 15 years later.",

One Saturday morning his 9 year old sister drops a glass while getting out a bowl to eat cereal. Dad comes out of his bedroom, completely naked, looks around at the 5 kids staring terrified at him and growls ‘WHO MADE THE FUCKING NOISE!?’ Littlest girl, who is crying, raises her hand. Dad crosses room in two big steps and slaps her in the back of the head, WHAP. ‘Shut the fuck up!’ He yells and storms back in his room and slams the door. 7 am. Saturday. Everyone just goes back to doing what they were doing and when dad gets up at noon everyone acts like it never happened. \n\n\nHad an aunt and uncle in Hanover and I would stay over for the weekend and babysit my younger cousins while aunt and uncle went out. I was 12 at the time. Uncle and aunt are having a party upstairs at their house and ask if I can just watch the kids in the basement while the parents were upstairs. No problem, but the parents told me that I had to stay downstairs while the party was going on. The kids could come upstairs if they needed to, but I should not come up until the party is over. Around 6 I head downstairs into converted basement to watch tv with the kids and people arrive. Older cousin is about 5 and asks if he can go upstairs about 2 hours into the party because he wants to ask his mom something. I said sure, he goes up and comes back less than 5 minutes later. I asked if he talked to his mom. He said mom couldn’t talk right now because she was naked with Mr and Mrs Barton in her bedroom. Yea, aunt and uncle were swingers, had parties, and didn’t seem to care if the kids knew or saw. As long as I didn’t see, it was ok. \n\nLast one is my dad. 30 year military, divorced mom when I was in 4th grade. On the back of the toilet tank in his bathroom, he had porn. Always. Penthouse, Oui, Hustler, but also super hardcore stuff he picked up overseas. All of my friends who came over asked if they could use mom and dads bathroom and they all took like 15 minutes in there. Mom and dad never talked about it or mentioned it. \n\nThe 70’s were weird.",

I have 5 siblings, one being my twin, and we’ve only ever had 1 bathroom; if someone was having a bath and you needed the loo, you walked right in (not guests though!) Also we never had an issue with nudity (only confined to the bathroom) but when you’ve got a number of us trying to get ready for school and work in the morning, and needing to use the bathroom, it wasn’t odd to see us all in varying states of undress or completely naked. When I’ve told my friends that it was normal for us they’ve always been like “so you’ve seen your siblings/parents naked???” and I’ve never understood their issues with it personally. Big family, not enough room… needs must.\n\nNow another thing, again very tame, that I find weird with other people or families is not washing themselves in the morning. Again because there’s (was) a lot of us in the house, and we only had a bath and no shower, me and my twin brother would have bath night on Sundays, to be fresh for the new school week. Having a bath all the time was expensive and also time consuming because you’d have to wait for the hot water tank to refill if you wanted a fresh bath… so instead of having baths all the time, my mum used to strip wash us (face, hands, armpits, nether regions and feet) every morning and evening so we were fresh for the day/going to bed as kids until we were able to do it ourselves. Now I used to *assume* everybody washed in the mornings but I noticed on sleepovers that my friends would literally just roll out of bed, get changed then clean their teeth but not wash their faces or anything and I found it and still find it incredibly strange. Even to this day I still have a strip wash every morning, and shower every other day. I’m not really sure why it irks me so much but the thought of not even washing your face after a full night makes me feel odd.",

There were a bunch of kids there, including a boy and his sister. They were older. He was probably 9, and I think she was 10 or 11. \n\nOne day I was playing in the back yard with a couple of kids and we see a bunch of the other kids gathered around a picnic table that was on the patio. Curious, we go over to see what’s happening, and find the two siblings having sex under the picnic table. \n\nBeing very young, none us us really knew what we were seeing, and we all were asking questions. the boy was answering like he was conducting a live sex Ed class, even moving his and his sisters bodies to give the kids a better view of what he was doing.\n\nThree of the questions I vividly remember \n\nQ. What are you doing?\nA. It’s called fucking \n\nQ. Where are you putting it? Is it going in her butt?\nA. You put your dick in her pussy and you move it in and out \n\nAnd then I asked “What does it do? Why are you doing it?”\nThe boy said “It feels really good. Do you want to try?” And his sister looked at me and said “yea, you can do it next, if you want”\n\nI remember at that moment I had this feeling this was something really bad. Like I said, I was only 7, so I didn’t really have any idea what we were seeing. It was just a feeling. But I think I said something like “that’s ok” \n\nI remember those siblings repeating this a few more times while I was at that day care. \n\nI never told anyone that story. (Literally, Reddit, this is the first time I’ve ever told anyone) . I remember thinking I somehow would get in trouble, or I’d get the brother and sister in trouble. But, i really wished I wasn’t so scared to tell. As an adult, you quickly realized that there must be some horribly fucked up shit going on at the siblings home, and they needed help.",

Now I was totally freaking out, this bloody crazy who thinks his Jesus but is out right beaten a kid.

I had been dating a guy for a few weeks and he invited me to hang out and sleep over at his house (he still lived with his parents and two sisters). His house had 3 bedrooms and he didn’t have a bedroom of his own - he slept on the couch. He told me he used to have his own bedroom but had to give it up to his younger sister (his younger sister used to sleep in the living room on the couch). His older sister refused to share a room with the younger sister. I don’t even remember where he kept his stuff, I think in the garage? But every morning I slept over, we’d be sleeping on the couch, cuddling and get woken up by his mom using the treadmill next to the couch. The house also had two bathrooms and a half bathrooms, the master was in his parents room. The older sister took over the other full bathroom and didn’t allow anyone else to use it, even her own family. Anytime I had to shower or get cleaned up, my ex bf would escort me to his parents master bathroom to do so. It felt so uncomfortable to me to have to cut through his parents’ bedroom just to take a shower. Looking back, that family had a lot of dysfunction. They treated my ex bf like shit and catered to the older sister and left the younger one to fend for herself (she was depressed and there was concern of suicide at some point). I wonder how the younger sister is doing from time to time.\nEdit: I was 19 at the time and my ex was 18-19 I think",

Open cans of food, open containers, beer cans here and there. They had 3 pre-teens and two dogs and there was dog poo on the kitchen floor. The kids yelled that they wanted to go to the pool, so they threw their clothes on the floor instead of the hamper.  You couldn't see the bathroom floor, it was covered in dirty clothes.   Oh and the flies! So.many.flies.  It was like a horror movie.  My husband, kids and I stepped into the living room and we all looked at each other. I thought \"this can't be right\".  They knew company was coming over and they didn't care. I was so shocked I walked right out and sat down on a bench and made some excuse of not feeling well.

It's a brand new world for me. I think to myself \"this is it. This is the first time someone sees you for the adult you clearly are\". I go #3 combo meal. At that time it's a Quarter Pounder with cheese. We place our order and go downstairs to continue a heated game of Eternal Champions. (He had 2 of the 6 button controllers so it was LEGIT) About 20 minutes go by and we hear her return. \"Oh boys! Food is here!\" Up the stairs we run. I can already taste the food. We all sit down at the table and to my horror she had dumped her fries and her son (my at the time friend) fries into a pile in the middle of the table. I sit down only to find out they expect me to do the same. \"We all get more fries that way\" \"This is how we always do it\". I'm horrified as I am forced to dump those sweet sweet golden sticks into a pile. I die a little inside as I realize there is no way I can tell which fries were originally mine. The two of them then proceed to WRECK that pile of fries as I quietly eat my burger. If I had estimate just how many fries I ended up slamming into my mouth it'd be safe to say a child size. To this day I think of that every time I get fries. A few years out a mutual friend described a similar experience with that family although they were playing Tiny Toons All-Stars not Eternal Champions.",

She told him a couple of times to cut it out and  when he didn't she dragged him by the arm into her bedroom, and with the door open in full view of me and my older cousin (both 10ish) grabbed a belt and proceeded to beat his ass with it until he cried, while screaming at him, \"I told you to cut it out you need to fucking listen when I tell you something (etc).\"\n\nI must have looked shocked because older cousin gave me a weird look and said, \"What, your mom doesn't use a belt?\"",

Very inappropriate about the swinging...as in every time I'd give them a chance and go over there with my girlfriend , it'd lead to them being one eyed drunk trying to fuck me and my girlfriend . Even though we made it very clear we are not into that at all. He'd espescially say shit that , looking back, I should have busted skulls for. Not just tell him to fuck off like I would.\nAnyways, i try to see the good in people .....it's burnt me a few times for sure.....and thought.....if I go over before they're drunk....they might not get so weird.\nSo I stop in as I'm walking back from the community mailbox as neighbor guy waves me in as he's putsing around the yard on his quad. As I'm walking towards the house he floors the quad and tries doing a wheelie off of the short side (1 foot high)  of their retaining wall. he totally rolls the quad and it lands on him and then  tosses him a few feet. instead of being maimed like I thought he would be , he rolls over , does Peter Griffin pain wince  for a few seconds, and gets up.  his leg and hands  bleeding pretty good. more Rashed than cut though if that makes sense. he was limping good though. we flip the quad right side up and he says something along the lines of , \"no more driving quad high on mushrooms\". \nI just think, fuck it's like 5 o'clock on a Tuesday evening. His kids and wife are in the garden . This shit is somehow  normal for you guys???. lol\n\nSo we push the quad into the  garage .  immediately he starts showing me his hunting corner. It was mostly knives and sweet compound bows, I think a couple deer mounts too . He picks up one compound bow which is clearly his favorite and then an arrow....I say \"hey man , no shooting, you're probably too high for that.\" he says it's fine and then right in the garage , cocks it back with great force, and shoots it at the wall....\nyou're probably thinking no big deal.....but his garage was not insulated , so you have thin osb ply, a layer of tyvek paper, and vinyl siding. \nthe arrow goes through like butter .....barely slowed it down. we go outside and the arrow  head is at least 8 inches in the garden dirt , not more than ten feet from his wife and two twin 3 year olds picking strawberries. Easily coulda been a killshot. His wife and kids never even noticed to my knowledge. he went and James Bond collected the arrow... I'm standing there like uhhhh, you coulda just killed someone.   She gave him shit for the hole in the siding, because she heard the noise of the arrow  breaking the wall, but had no clue the arrow landed right beside them. That was my cue to leave.\n\nNow I've personally seen a lot crazier shit, but for a Tuesday evening, walking home with the mail, this twenty minutes was pretty whack. I could only imagine some of the shit that took place there on the weekends.",

I've met her parents before for dinner at a restaurant and they also seemed very normal. Almost, Flanders-like in how nice they were but they were not religious.\n\nIt was my first time being over at their house. Again, very normal looking and clean. Everything was well kept and organized. \n\nAnyway, we do what two teenagers do when left alone and after she had to go shower and clean up. However, I was holding on from pooping because when you are 19, your erection overrides all other impulses, so I had to look for another bathroom I could take a dump into while she's showering.\n\nI figure I could do a stealth dump in her parent's master bedroom bathroom across the hall since they're gone for weeks anyway. However when I opened the bathroom door I was greeted by an overwhelming stench of shit worse than a non-maintained public toilet. The bath tub was filled with shit. I only glanced at it for a split second but it was like that bath tub in Silence of the Lambs but with lots of floating solid shit. At that point I really don't feel like shitting anymore and is resisting vomiting. To this day the image of it still haunts my nightmares and the smell I can never forget. \n\nI thought maybe the pipes burst and it leaked into the tub. But when I told her that, she just did a long sigh and sat me down. She said that it's something her mother did. She would collect her shit in the tub and they just leave the exhaust fans on and that master bedroom bathroom door closed all the time. Her mother literally piled poop on the tub for some reason and the entire family accepted like this was part of her process. \n\nI just pretended to accept it of course because she was so hot and just nodded that I understood it was some sort of compulsion. Although I think she kinda knew I was definitely weirded out by it and we eventually broke up a few months later. That was the only time I've been to their house and I've tried avoiding dinner invites because I don't think I can look her mother in the eye.",

            "text": "I had a friend who threw a party at his sister’s house. The sister was in her early 20’s and she had a baby girl that hadn’t yet learned to walk but was able to crawl around very well. The friend of mine was about 15 or 16 at the time. Not even a half hour later, the sister very abruptly left, leaving her daughter behind in the care of a houseful of mostly teenaged boys. My other friend and I were the only females. At one point we noticed the baby crawling around and that her diaper was so full it was falling off of her. This diaper looked like it hadn’t been changed in at least 2, maybe 3 days. There were no diapers or wipes in the house so we put her in the tub to get all the caked shit off of her and then had to use a t-shirt to wrap around her as a makeshift diaper. There was no food and certainly no milk or formula and I think we finally ended up giving her some kool aid from a plastic cup in little sips that she’d choke on because she didn’t know how to drink from a cup. I stayed overnight and the sister never once called or came back and they had no idea where she was or when she’d be back and apparently this was normal behavior for her. \n\nI’ve been a complete fuckup of a human being before and definitely messed up with my own children so I know I don’t have room to judge, but I’ve never been able to get over that memory. It blew my mind that someone would just leave their infant behind with a bunch of wild teenaged boys on drugs and not call or even leave basic necessities for that baby. It was even sadder that there were no toys for this kid-I still wonder about that baby and whether or not she survived and if she did, I wonder what sort of hell she endured throughout her childhood.\n\nAnother thing that stands out in my mind is from when I used to be a private duty CNA that cared for a man in his early 50’s living in his parent’s home as well as a brother who just sat in the living room chain smoking all day. \n\nThe parents were in their late 80’s. The man I cared for  had a stroke and just laid in his bed all day instead of actively trying to get better. He wore diapers and laid on bed pads to soak up the excess urine that would always overflow out of his diaper. His family did very little to care for this man and sometimes he would lay in the same urine soaked diaper and bedpad for several days at a time when I was off and there was nobody around to change him. \n\nHe was on a feeding tube and the mother would do his feedings but she didn’t do it properly and also kept giving him food and drinks when he wasn’t supposed to have it. I think she was purposely trying to keep him sick and bed-ridden so they could continue to draw his disability check, which clearly wasn’t being used for him at all. \n\nI forgot to mention that the house was so severely infested with roaches that they would fall off the door frames and onto whoever was underneath it. I dreaded going there because of the severe infestation. I would sit in a chair and shake my legs out of nervous energy and as a means of keeping any bugs from crawling on me. One of the worst things I’ve ever seen was walking in on the beginning of my shift and seeing roaches crawling all over this man (who smelled like straight up ammonia due to the buildup of large amounts of urine pooling in his bed)…but the worst part was seeing them trying to crawl into his feeding tube. The feeding tube was clogged and the clamp on the end of his feeding tube wouldn’t stay plugged in because his mother had basically ruined the tube and neglected to do anything about it. The tube often leaked, especially if he coughed, which meant that was a food source the roaches were attracted to. \nI took care of that man for as long as I could, which was about a year because I felt so bad for him and simply just could not handle it any longer after watching this man wither away and literally just stuck laying in his own filth being consumed inside and out by roaches, all because of the neglect of his family. \n\nI’ve encountered lot of individuals from years of partying and a few stints of being homeless and having to couch surf with random people I’d meet. I saw a lot of appalling, disgusting and disturbing  homes and behaviors from when I lived that life for sure, but it blew me away what I saw in the homes of the people I took care of. I didn’t expect to see abuse and neglect so normalized within the families and the complaint I worked for at the time. The stories I just shared are only a small fraction of some really insane things I’ve seen, but those are some of the memories that haunt me and that I still wonder and think about often. The human race can be pretty disappointing at times 🥺",

This kid and I were good friends so I was pretty comfortable in his house and around his family and had never really found them to be odd. I actually felt jealous of their seemingly more normal family. At the end of the night I went to get ready for bed in the bathroom as I was always lead to believe that was the appropriate place to change in an outside environment, fairly straightforward. I change, brush my teeth and then use the bathroom for going to the bathroom. His mom tries to come in the bathroom “to check on [me]” but I have the door locked, for obvious privacy reason. She the proceeds to have a complete and utter meltdown! She is beating on the door with both fists threatening to break it off the hinges, kicking at it with her foot, like I am some sort of soon to be unlucky protagonist in a horror movie. All the while, here I am with my ninja turtle underoos around my ankles and I don’t know what to do. I start to fear that violence is imminent if I don’t hurry, so I hop down, pull up my pants and open the door. She barges in pushes me to the side and starts inspecting the bathroom like a prison bunk raid. She then starts yelling and goes off on a tirade about how we don’t lock doors in this house for, as best as I could understand to this very day 30 years later, for safety reasons. I asked why they didn’t just replace the door locks, with non-locking doors in such a situation. She then goes off on me for telling her when she can have locks on her doors. Her kids are just watching all this unfold until she leaves me tears and finally relents, long after really hammering in the point. My friends are just like, “duh, you’re not allowed to lock the door.” I got my stuff and left, with my business unfinished and my hands unwashed. When my parents asked why I was home so early, I said I had to go to the bathroom and left it at that. I never used the bathroom or stayed over at their house again.",

There were five neighbors who I stayed with over the course of two weeks. The first- Beth, with her son, Brice, was pretty normal for the first couple days. It was fun playing with him all day long. He had some pretty cool toys and there was a massive hide and seek afternoon. Well by the fourth day, my mom sent us up to her apartment by ourselves and we had our matchbox case with us because of our plan the day before. We knocked on the door and Beth yelled for us to come in. So we go in and notice that none of Brice’s toys are out. And then we see that Brice is completely naked. My older brother asked where his clothes were. Beth said that he wasn’t feeling good- which didn’t make a lot of sense.    \nWe were there for a couple minutes holding our cases not sure what to do when all of a sudden Brice squats down and poops right on the floor. It was a really thin kind of carpet that the whole building had. My brother gets up and tells Beth, who is down the hall in the kitchen, that Brice just pooped on the floor. Then he came in and sat back down next to me. The smell was intense and the poop was green. A few minutes later, she comes in with some toilet paper and scoops up the poop and goes to flush it down the toilet.        \nWe just sat there like wtf still clutching our matchbox cases. Beth sat on the chair like nothing weird just happened. About 10 minutes later, he squats again and poops again. Beth is watching him intently and gets the toilet paper ready to scoop it up. Now at this point, I’m noticing that there are a couple other spots on the carpet where he must have pooped before we got there.       \nAfter about the fifth time this happens, she asks him if he’s done pooing. He nods yea and she takes him to get dressed. We both got up and looked at the stains on the carpet like wtf is actually happening right now. My brother had a worried look on his face I was just like shrug.     \nWe told kom about this and she didn’t believe us so she went to ask Beth about it that night.

Another time the dude stuck an open lip gloss tube into his anus, then either tricked or forced his teen brother to use it. (Can't recall the exact story 20+ years later).    Tim would whip his cock out in school and chase me down a hallway like that, so I have zero doubt any of the other stories are true. \n\nTim eventually moved a few hours away and I was convinced to go with my bestie to visit this crazy guy.  IIRC the 2nd time we made the trip to visit him he had broken up with his BF and was technically homeless.  We hadn't gotten a hotel room since we assumed we were staying at their place.  Tim had us drive their anyway and he smashed a window to break in the garage and let us in.   I slept on the couch expecting to either be arrested or murdered by morning.  \n\nThe following night we slept on the floor of one of Tim's lesbian friends (who was not home).  Tim decided (as a \"prank\") to come out of the bedroom in his underwear and pretend to piss in her fish tank.   Instead of pissing though he spun around and tried to jump on me and pretend to rape me.  I was/am a big ape myself so I fought him off.   He came out a few mins later and tried again, so I put him in an armbar UFC style and he ran off to the bedroom.  \n\nLong story short Tim ended up doing coke, and at some point got infected with AIDS and was having unprotected sex with guys w/o warning them.  This earned him a confrontation one evening where an ex-lover stabbed him in the face with a knife, causing him to become brain dead.

I was a TV repairman during college in the mid 1980's.\n\nI went to a customer's apartment to look at her TV. She was probably in her 40's but she was dressed like a housewife from the 1950's: old fashioned dress, shoes and hairdo like you'd see in the old sitcoms--like I Love Lucy, or Ozzy and Harriet. The apartment was spotless and smelled very clean. The entire place was furnished in vintage furniture that looked brand new. It was like stepping into a museum of the 1950's.\n\nIt was a hot summer day and she offered me a Coke, which I gladly accepted. She brought out a tray with two glasses of ice, and a bottle of coke in the curvy glass bottle they had in the 50's. She poured us each a glass and set them on coasters on the table between the two chairs where we were seated. She lifted her glass in the \"cheers\" motion, so I did too. When the side of my hand touched the table as I picked up my glass, it came away wet and at first I thought maybe it was just sweat because it was such a hot day. But as I brought my hand up to take a drink I caught the smell of Lemon Fresh Pledge furniture polish. I looked at the table and could see the dry spot where I'd touched start to fill back in with the liquid.  I thought the tables were just polished and dusted very well, but I realized they were all super shiny because of a thick layer of furniture polish.\n\nI just kind of played it cool and chatted with the customer for a few minutes, then got down to business, and asked about her TV. She showed me an older model floor-model TV with the round picture tube. It was black and white and had the rabbit-ears antenna. (And yes, the top was drenched with Lemon Pledge.) I can't remember what the problem was, because it's been over 30 years ago, but I remember pulling the back off and being really surprised that I could actually fix it. I always carried a big case with the old vacuum tubes in my truck and I had the right one I needed.\n\nI know the readers have probably been expecting a horror story outcome, like me waking up in a bathtub of ice missing a kidney, but everything went well, and she was an appreciative customer. When I got back to the shop my boss asked how it went. He told me he had been fixing this TV for years, and he knew the customer well. He wanted to let me experience this customer. He told me, \"For the rest of your life, whenever you smell Lemon Pledge you're going to remember that apartment.\" It's true. My wife keeps it in the house, but dusting furniture is one chore I won't do. Like what if I can't stop spraying once I start?",

After a couple of sleepovers there, I kept having her come to my house. She was failing school and didn't know how to take care of herself. Her grandma left her during fifth grade and so she was basically being neglected cuz her dad never got off his ass. She was allowed to see her mom every once in a while but just like at her dad's it was horrible. She had like 6 dogs and 3 other siblings with completely different dads. Her other grandparents were there and it was trashed completely as well. She had also been r\\*ped at the age of 4 by a guy her mom had been with. Her situation was horrible. I remember in the middle of fifth grade, she told me her mom was arrested for carrying 6 pounds of m\\*th. She said it so normal like it was something she was used to. Her dad let her smoke when she was 11. Me and my friend couldn't deal with it anymore and so my friend's mom anonymously called CPS. She isn't allowed to see her dad so she has to live at her mom's. I  think she's still in jail so she's being watched by her grandparents. I still reach out to her every once in a while to make sure she's okay. She's welcome to my house whenever she needs/wants to stay over for whatever reason.

First off he had 2 older brothers and a step dad with two younger half sisters. Their house was chaotic most of the time, not very clean, step-dad was stern with him and older brother, his oldest brother had already moved out by age 16 after he and step dad physically fought,  blows, step dad beat shit out of oldest brother.  Girls had free reign to whatever they wanted whenever they wanted.  I woke up many times (on couch because their house was too small, not enough room for 4 kids) to the girls jumping on me, like WWE off the back of couch landing feet in my stomach,  on my face wherever. Entire family thought it was normal and funny.  \n\nNow the craziest thing that happened : set the back story. I played football middle through high school,  played baseball same time frame.  I also trained Teakwundo and Jutisu for 6 years (we lived in the worst neighborhood on the Baltimore city border,  technically we lived in the county but, my alley was Baltimore City, my parents wanted me to #1 stay out of trouble,  #2 be able to defend myself). \nWell my best friend did not play sports,  had zero martial arts or any kind of defensive training. He got beat up just a few times when I was not around. When I was around he never got beat up, we even won fights that were 5/6 on 2, he would fight one and I would fight the rest. He would win (think a confidence and pride thing with me around). \n\nHis step dad (gets some wild hare up his a$$), step dad actually calls my house ask my parents if I can come down and hang out with my friend. I am thinking everything is normal,  just weird step dad called to ask me over. I get there, step dad is on front porch with pair of boxing gloves,  my friend is in his front yard. Step dad says \"I want you two to box\", I immediately so \"no I am not boxing my friend\", my friend says to step dad \"I don't want to box him\". His step dad went on to egg us both on but, especially my friend,  calling him all kinds of names, a p-ssy, a girl, chicken sh-t, repeatedly saying he was afraid.  Finally my friend said (fine I will box him). I told my friend I don't want to box you. Step dad started the \"what is wrong,  you afraid your friend is going to kick your a$$, and name calling\". I still refused to fight,  I did not want to fight my friend.  Well I guess pressure from step dad got to him and my friend started saying \"what is wrong are you afraid and some name calling \". I finally said \"okay if you really want to box me\". I put my gloves on (he already has his on). Step dad is saying stuff like \"kick his a$$, boy you better not loose\", he is cheerleader and trying to give instructions as we box. I am taking it easy with 25/30% power in my punches. I am slapping him around,  face shots, body shots all at will. He can't hit me (he is trying but, can't land). Step dad is getting more aggressive with instructions telling him what to do, saying things like knock him out, kick his a$$ and repeatedly downing him for not being able to land, calling him those same names. I call break and tell them I am done, tell my friend \"you did good man\". Step dad is having none of it, barrates my friend.  My friend says \"I am not done\" takes a sucker punch swing at me when I am still saying  \"no we are done\". I side head slip the swing but, did get a little mad, I hit him with a 3 punch, jab, jab, cross to his face with about 40% strength.  I can immediately see it in his eyes, he is pissed, feelings hurt. He draws back as far as he can take a leaping long looping,  hard as he possibly could swing at my head. I jabbed him straight (65-70% power)   his nose exploded immediately, I ducked his looping swing and uppercut him at 75/80% power, he lifted 6-8\" off the ground landing flat on his back out cold. I turn to the step dad and yelled at him \" see, see, why would you force us to fight, \" threw my glove down in front of him and went home. I never told my parents about it.\n\nIt got worse though.  The step dad was then recruiting kids from the neighborhood and adjacent neighborhoods to come over to their house while I was there to get them to box me trying to get someone to kick my a$$. I ended up boxing 14/15 kids beating the snot out of each. Finally the step dad stopped trying to get kids to fight me. By this time my parents knew I was boxing while at my friends house. I think the boxing stopped because my father (grew up in Baltimore city,  did some amateur boxing himself) must have threatened the step dad. \n\nI apologized to my friend a week later when he would talk to me again and we remained friends until we were 18. We went our seperate ways for school and work.",

They openly smoked around us and the house always smelled strange, was kinda dirty, etc. They had young children (toddler age) that they were letting drink mountain dew, energy drinks, just stuff you should never be feeding a young child imo. They also cussed in front of their young children. But it gets way worse.\n\nThe friend, who was the same age as me, would make me watch inappropriate videos, like porn and weird cartoons and just really sexual stuff. I didn’t understand it really at the time, but I have a lot of guilt from this because I feel like it’s my fault that I watched them with her or that I didn’t try to go home immediately. I guess I was curious or something. She would ask me if I touched myself, and when I didn’t know what she meant, she explained it to me. \n\nLooking back on it I know what was happening, but at the time, I didn’t tell anyone or do anything about it. It would give me this sick, guilty feeling in my stomach, like I knew what she was doing to me was wrong, but I was afraid to tell anybody. This friend also casually mentioned to me that her and another female classmate had sex in her bathtub. (Again, we were in the fourth grade.) I didn’t believe her at the time.\n\nOne day sort of recently a close long-term friend confided in me that the exact same thing had happened to her, with this same friend, except worse. \n\nI’ve never unpacked this incident to anybody besides this close long term friend. We haven’t discussed it since. We did both stop hanging out with this mutual “friend” in fifth grade for obvious reasons but we were so young and didn’t understand what was happening to us at the time.",

Kids came in with hangovers reeking of Axe spray or Bath & Body Works perfumes to cover it up, holding gigantic coffees in some cases...

Being a decently nice kid and from a lower-middle class family, I decided to attend said sleepover. While she was giving me a tour of her house, I couldn't help but notice her bedroom was absolutely massive compared to her parents room. So I asked what the deal was with that and she said that since she was an only child, her parents had given her the master bedroom because they wanted her to have a big space for a lot of toys. Okay, cool. That checks out. She was an only child and her room was filled with insane amounts of goodies. So we play with some Barbies for a while then go downstairs while her mom is finishing up dinner. I was telling her mom how nice her house was and how cool it was that they let their daughter have such a big room, I mean, what a dream! And she proceeds to nonchantley tell me that their daughter had actually thrown huge tantrum and demanded to SWITCH bedrooms and how could they say no after she had put up such a big fuss over something had decided she wanted. Okay... red flag number one: noted. Then we sit down for dinner. Well, her parents and I did... my \"new friend\" ate from a dog bowl on the floor. Confused, I start asking a bunch of questions. Apparently, she only would eat Dinty Moore Beef Stew while she was at home cause her parents refused to buy her actual dog food and also only from a dog bowl on the floor. The entire dinner, her mom was begging her to \"please at least eat some peas at the table with your friend.\" She would only bark back in response and I guess that meant no because she never came to the table. After the most awkward dinner I've still ever had, she started hardcore bossing me around and did things like refused to allow me to touch her computer mouse when it was my turn to makeover my Barbie on her Mac, would only let me watch her jump on her trampoline, etc. Then we played with her hamsters but she demanded that I only play with them her very precise way and a few times I fucked up I guess cause she started literally screaming at me that I was \"doing it wrong!\" SO I only had one choice as a lone child in a house of crazies: I faked throwing up in her stolen master ensuite bathroom, claimed I was homesick, and called my mom at 2am to get me. She got there with lightning speed and took me to Krystals drive thru (yum, open 24/7 yall!) while I spilled all the beans on what had happened.\n\nTl;dr: Friend was bossy af and ate like a dog on the floor.",

But then it got REALLY awkward. After TV, we all got marched upstairs to the bathroom where my friend's father proceeded to bathe all of us, together, in the tub. Nothing molesty happened but Jesus Christ it was awful. Then he dried our hair with a hair dryer one by one while the others stood around and watched. I was last. I remember my friend and his brother helping direct their father on which parts of my hair were still wet and needed additional blow-drying. I remember looking at their faces in the mirror hoping they too had looks of shame and dejection, but instead being met with vapid, pleasant smiles. Then we were in bed by 8:00. I remember having never been so relieved to be sent to bed at 8:00 on a Friday night. Even on school nights my bedtime was 9:00, but i was given a little more leeway on weekends. Sleepovers at my house usually meant pizza and video games and doing what all kids wanted to do on Friday nights, not some Christian Camp routine and humiliating group baths like we were babies.\nI liked this friend, and we stayed friends for many years; he was without a doubt a normal well-adjusted kid.

She was so excited she invited me to stay the night even though we didn't really know each other and go to a theme park with her family the next morning.\nWhen I got to her house her mom was in her underwear on a mattress in the living room and step dad was really back woodsy looking and neither of them really said anything to me or had us eat anything when I was there. Then like around eight her step dad made us shut the lights out for the night and we weren't allowed to talk and we were in like eighth or ninth grade. Of course we whispered and giggled but we ended up getting gotten onto and she got more serious about us nottalking. \nI feel like I remember it was still light outside and it made me feel a little sick about my situation because it creeped me out and I felt like we weren't allowed out of the room. I think we were only allowed in there or in the back yard . I think later we snuck a few saltine crackers but it was weird.\nThen we went to the theme park the next day because her little sister had spina bifida and they had free tickets but it was six hours away. I had to sit by her and she was soo cute and sweet but the parents didn't change her and she smelled really bad. It was so sad.\nThen the girl got mad at me because she was hungry (seriously that was why) at the theme park and ditched me. Literally ran away from me. We were six hours from home too. \nLater I found her parents and sister and told them what happened and they laughed at me and walked away.\nI was sick and terrified by that but luckily I saw the girl again. She tried to run away but I yelled \"at least give me my cellphone!\" She had it in the purse I gave her.\nThen she gave it to me and ran away again.\nI was lucky to have the cell phone and my parents almost had to head on there way from six hours away to get me and the bitch finally ate and saw me again and was suddenly cool and excited to ride more rides with me, lol.\nThat was all I remember about hanging out with her and I never had felt better to be back home by myself.\nI was so scared!

My friend and I were talking about the dog farting before lunch aswell, so I didn't think it'd be a problem. Boy was I wrong. The parents (mainly the mother) freaked out and started screaming at me threatening to throw me out and how I couldn't say something like that. I was extremely terrified and started crying, and she actually threw me out. Made me call my parents and then dropped me off there. She lectured my parents about how \"terribly they raised me\". I was so confused, especially since my parents never really cared about swearing, and I didn't even do that. Just said the dog farted.",

She never really cared when I told her it was embarassing and did it multiple times with different friends.  \n\n\n\\- My mother would collect panini cards with football teams. She was completely nuts with them, and would ask for other people's missing cards list to complete them. She literally completed each year 2-3 magazines that weren't hers.  \n\n\n\\- She also had some kind of ... helper syndrom ?

While it sounds kinda lovely of her, it was actually her trying to help fellow portuguese immigrants that were doing shit with their finances, by... lending them money she would never recover.  \n\n\n\\- Also my parents would just bind me to the kitchen chair with a belt if I weren't to finish my plate. They were also very easy on the physical abuse and every.fucking.time I said something that was unpleasant to them, they would hit me with a wooden spoon on the fingers, pull my hair, kick my ass or slap me.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a loooot of others things that I don't remember about at the moment, but it was mostly daily abuse.

The public school system was pretty rough and underfunded, so my parents had this idea that I should spend 8th grade at a charter school as a bridge to high school.\n\nThe school we ultimately settled on was a charter school (for kids who got expelled from other schools) in a rough area of town. It was a formative year for me let me tell you.\n\nI made this friend, we’ll call him Josh. We used to ride the city bus from school to Josh’s house all the time.

It was great! As all good things do, the fun ended the moment my friends older brother got home. I always thought her brother was so cool because he was maybe 5-ish years older than us. My opinion changed rather quickly after this visit. \n\nAt first her brother kept standing behind us while we were sitting on their couch. Weird but ok. Then he began asking my friend to come into his room. My friend kept saying no and rolling her eyes. Ok then. I tried to ignore this too even thought my little alarm bells were going off (thanks mom for raising me on the Cops TV show). Eventually the brother gave up this tactic and decided to switch it up I guess. I remember he first asked my friend if she would come into his room for $10. My friend said no. Her brother upped the offer to $15. Again my friend said no, so her brother turned to me and offered me the $15 to go to his room. My mind was blown. $15 seemed like a crap ton of money to my child brain, but again my little alarms were still ringing. Before I could answer, my friend looks me dead in the eye and tells me I'll regret it of I go in her brothers room. I was freaked the fuck out. Her brother stormed off to his room and I figured maybe that was the last we'd see of him for the evening, but no that would have been to easy. The universe could not have that.\n\nAfter my friends mom made us dinner, I needed to go to the restroom. As I was doing my thing in there, I noticed the door knob start to jiggle a little bit. Being the innocent child I was, I thought someone needed to use the restroom so I yelled that the restroom was occupied. That didn't stop the door knob from jiggling thought. I was starting to sweat. I have no idea how long that went on for but at the time it felt like forever. Suddenly I heard shouting from the other side of the door. My friends mom went to check on me and saw her son standing in front of the bathroom door. \n\nNeedless to say, I called my mom immediately after I came out of the restroom and went home. It wasn't until I was older that I happened to remember this. Maybe I was over reacting, but those two incidents alone freaked me out and I stayed away from my friends house.",

Only if I was being out of line would he ever get stern or sound angry.\n\n2nd friend, 2 brothers to be exact, their parents were way more strict than I was used to. 30 minutes of video game time per day, forced us to go outside and play in the summer heat, etc. It never felt abusive, just controlling. It was another \"yes sir\", no talking back to your parents, household. They did follow guest protocol though, but it sucked knowing that after you left, your friends were gonna have to deal with whatever consequence. The part that's the most weird, and probably wouldn't fly today is that if you uttered the phrase \"no fair\" or anything similar when regarding a rule or decision from the parents, you'd be forcibly tickled. Even guests, it didn't matter. You learned real quick no to complain about their house rules, even if it was something your oen parents did differently, because you'd absolutely get dog piled and tickled by their dad and the other kids. Granted, we'd join in and tickle our friend too when the time came. 15 years ago it seemed like just a weird silly thing, but it's definitely not something that'd fly today. Those parents seemed to have mellowed out a ton since their sons have grown up though, and he's still one of my good buds.",

We'd played after school quite a few times but we'd never spent time in each others homes. When I got there around mid morning the family was getting ready to go to the beach. He had a brother and 4 sisters so there was alot of activity. His mom said to call my mom and ask if I could go with them. She spoke to my mom and my mom said I could go.\n\nWe had a great time. \n\nWhen we got home all the kids ran to the outdoor shower to rinse off. It was behind  the house in the back yard. The oldest sister who was 14 disappeared into the house and came out with a stack of towels. My friend Joe turned on and adjusted the water. He suddenly striped off his swim suit and began to soap up. That was when I noticed the others were naked too! Joe's older sister told me I had to shower before going in the house. I remember feeling embarrassed but I took off my suit and did as I was told. \n\nThen Joe's mom came out carrying his 3 year old brother and stepped under the shower with the little boy. Joe's mom was naked too. And his dad came out and off came his bathing suit. There were 2 showerheads and everyone was jumping in and out of the water and soaping and shampooing. \n\nEveryone dried off and headed into the house. It was chaotic, as large families can be. Kids grabbing sodas from the fridge and fighting over who got what seat on the couches to watch TV and what show to watch. Joe's mother yelling that there was no snacking before dinner and so on. Except that everyone was naked! As natural as could be! I think I got over my embarrassment but I thought it was crazy. I found out later they were a nudist family but I had never heard of such a thing.\n\nThey were very open about other things as well. The mother came into the living room at one point and, looking at Joe's 6 year old sister, she told her to go to her room if she wanted to masturbate. I didn't know what that was but as I looked at the girl sitting cross legged on the floor I saw her hand was on her vagina. I really got my eyes opened that day. \n\nIt's funny but the only time I was embarrassed was when I was looking at the 12 and 14 year old sisters. Well, I was a 10 year old boy, so not so odd.\n\nI eventually told my mom about it. She didn't really forbid me from going to Joe's home but she did discourage it. About a year later Joe's dad (who was an FBI agent) got transferred to another state and they moved.\n\nWow! Weird.",

I was too early for the sticky-diaper wearing iPad wielding- cocomelon watching preschooler, but there to atleast have a cell phone by 7th grade. I remember going to my friends house for a sleepover, and walking into his house. Seemed normal, except there was no TV in the living room, no clocks, no microwave, the lights were off, ext. Now when this kid would come to my house, he would be enamored with everything relating to video games and just technology and I never knew why. Hell this kid beat Skyrim on my Xbox at my house over the years we hung out. But, going to his house for the first time, I found out why. His mother was a psychopath who despised technology. She took my phone the instant I walked into the house, and told me I could get my \"one way ticket to hell\" back when I left. So the sleepover was super boring, just me and this kid cycling through his board game collection, and he kept repeatedly apologizing to me, saying \"this is why I never invite you over\" and \"I hate her more than you, believe me\" but then, I remember leaving the next day and forgetting my phone. So me and my mom drove back over to their house, and I told her about how crazy her mom was, and that I didn't want to talk to her (to be honest I was kinda scared of her) and I just remember my mom getting out of the car, saying \"How bad could she be?\" Then 10 minutes later (yes 10 minutes I counted) she gets back in the car, gives me my phone, and just goes \"f*cking b*tch\" under her breath. I asked her what happened, and apparently this woman lectured my mom about how dangerous technology is, and how it can ruin the mind of a innocent child (we were in 8th grade, not really innocent anymore) and blah blah blah. The kid never really talked to me much anymore, and we kinda grew apart in high school.\n\nThen here's a bonus of what ended up happening to the kid in high school-\nBecame a mound of pure angst against his mother, got a job, bought a Xbox and a cell phone (high treason against his mother) starting taking drugs, got kicked out at 17, and didn't graduate. I like to think that it was more the mothers fault then the kid at the end of the day",

The top of the upstairs landing had carpet that was always soaked. I thought it was humidity or that I was imagining that my socks were always damp after walking up there. Then one day I'm sitting at the kitchen table and my feet become stuck to the floor. I look under the table and there were multiple dried puddles of dog pee that had been there for weeks. Dust, debris, garbage stuck to them and all. It was then that I realized the dog did this in multiple spots and the top of the stairs on the carpet was one of them. Their argument was \"we're waiting for the dog to die before replacing the carpet\". It's been 7 years. The dog is still alive. \n\n\nThe same family also had their 17 year old daughter still sleeping in between the parents every night. If they wanted to have sex they'd put pillows up against the door so she would see no light coming through the crack and that meant she had to wait for the all clear to go to bed. They came right out and admitted this one night when I saw her sitting on the floor (the one with dog pee all over it) waiting to be allowed to enter the bedroom. They were Irish immigrants and claimed this was \"normal\" there and didn't see an issue with it.\n\nThe mother would also stay up at night and check on the 4 kids (aged 17-24) after they'd been drinking because they would regularly pee on the floors next to their beds or vomit in bed. She would clean it, change their sheets, change their pajamas or put some on to begin with ALL WHILE THEY WERE SLEEPING so that they wouldn't even know it had happened when they woke up. How she did it, I'll never know.\n\nNeedless to day, I ran far away from that family very quickly.",

A game she specifically approved of because the name in Japan was \"Mother\", and this appeared to be wholesome in nature simply based on the name. I believe this was only like 10 minutes total, essentially waiting for supper.\n\nSupper went well, nothing too out of the ordinary other than being almost directly after school (4pm-ish).\n\n2) play nerf guns in the house. Which sounded fun at first, however as it turns out, she removed the foam ends as they apparently hurt too much. Then she simply taped over the holes, to allow the guns to still propel darts forward..... barely. Maybe a half hour total there.\n\n3) Then we would watch an \"adult\" comedy, as it was a special occasion. This turned out to be \"Leonard Part 6\", starring Bill Cosby. a PG movie. This was the most adult thing the boy had ever seen, and was beyond excited, because my existence in the house meant he could be \"naughty\" tonight, as he told me. Their movie cabinet was filled almost entirely with Bill Cosby specials, VHS tapes of the Cosby Show, as well as other Bill Cosby movies and a few Whoopie Goldberg classics.\n\nFinally it was time for bed, at 7pm, where the mom tucked us in, and I mean tucked us in TIGHT. and gave us both flashlights so we could have \"laser sword battles\" during the rundown of the timer she left on the dresser. Once that timer was run-down she requested that we be asleep...\n\nThe next morning at breakfast, I heard the boy tell his mom that \"having a friend over was not as exciting as he had hoped\", and he was \"eager for me to leave\" so that things could get back to just being HIM in the house.

I thought I would at least share some of it with you strangers.\nI was born in the early 80’s but lived as if I was born in the 1800’s. I grew up in a cabin that my father built by hand and we lived without electricity, running water, indoor toilet, phone or refrigerator for nearly 16 years. Out of all of my friends I had the best outhouse with side by side seats and a great view of our lake. During the summer it was amazing to be able target practice with your BB gun shooting pine cones all the while taking a crap. In the winter it was a different story. When it was 10 degrees outside and there is a huge snowdrift between you and that outhouse you really start to question your parents life decisions. Most of our neighbors were hippies or Vietnam vets and lived very similar to us. So it really never seemed odd to me that we had an outhouse.\nThe moment I knew we were different was when a friend came over for a sleep over in second grade. Everything was fine until it got dark. My parents lit the kerosene lamps and they only put out so much light so there are a lot of shadows around the house. I guess this kid was terrified of the dark and thought that a bear was going to break into the cabin or something. It wasn’t until we were about to go to bed and he asked where the restroom was and I said it was outside down by the lake. He flipped out and said he needed to call his mom. Well he was out of luck. We had a nice long distance CB but I highly doubt it would reach all the way to town. I thought everyone had a CB at that time. Well this kid freaked out and started crying and saying he needed to go home to use the restroom. So we all got into the van and drove him into town which is about 45 minutes away. I was always kind of ashamed growing up this way as a kid, especially when I would see how normal the kids that lived in town life seemed to be compared to mine. Years later I look back and I realize how lucky I was to be raised in a home full of love and we had nothing but time to spend with each other.",

All my siblings did, especially my brothers. My sister was a bit less social, but they still got to do stuff like that. They got to do whatever activities they wanted to and such, but when I wanted to do stuff it got held over my head. There were even times that I was guilted for eating “too much” food (I was a growing boy who was a multiple sport athlete so I ate a lot but come on, it wasn’t anywhere close to an abnormal amount, especially compared to how much I saw most of my other friends eat when we were teenagers). It has developed into terrible anxiety whenever someone offers to buy food for me or whenever I have to eat in front of others. Anyways, I am getting distracted.\n\nNow, I want to make it clear, I love my mother and she loves me. Now that I am an adult, we get along quite well. There is some backstory, and maybe I’m making excuses for her but so be it, she is the only parent I have left. My father was incredibly abusive, both physically and mentally. My older siblings didn’t have to do visitation with him because they were old enough to legally refuse, but my younger brother and I did. I remember a few times when I would get punched or beat or whipped with a belt and my mom would look at it and make notes and stuff about it for the courts but that was usually it. Then one day, he finally turned on my brother. The day after it happened my mom packed us up and rushed us to the ER in a nearby town that has a massive hospital. The works. Yes, what happened to my brother was bad, but I endured significantly worse a number of times. I remember thinking it was odd that she made such a big deal of it but it got us out of visitation for good so I brushed it off. \n\nAnyways, as time has gone on, I think more and more and realize that I was treated quite differently from my siblings and the entire time I thought that’s just how it went everywhere. Like I said, my relationship with my mother now is good, we talk all the time, she shows lots of affection towards me (although I will not lie, if I were to break up with my fiancé she would take my fiancé and kick me to the curb but it’s chill). I think I have it finally figured out…\n\nI look and sound just like my dad. I think she harbored resentment all that time because of that. Again, not making excuses, just an observation.",

The house was her step-dad's that one day just bailed on her and left all his hoarder stuff in the house and my friend was living there helping paying her rent etc. The house was always in really bad shape and had a 4ft brown stain in the middle of the floor and one time I went over there during the winter she was in the bedroom with the heaters on full under blankets because there was a huge 2ft hole in the roof. They didn't really think much of it and I thought it was weird that neither of them did anything to fix or block it but just turned the heat up and complained about the $350/m electric bill.\n\n2nd thing was they also told me they used to have roomates that were bf and gf. The gf I went to HS with as well and they finally kicked them out after she was having orgies. They also showed me their room with mirrors covering the walls and ceiling when I was over there one time and told me she practiced witchcraft and would have wierd seance and demon worshipping sessions trying to hex people and stuff and used the mirrors for that and demonic sex parties or something.\n\nLastly when they finally moved out of there my gf and I went over there to help clean for the landlord and my gf asked what the giant brown stain was. My friend casually told us 'that's where that lady died'- his gf's dad who bailed apparently had a addict gf who OD'd and during some accident somehow bled out on the carpet...\n\nI also have another friend who's mom was an extreme cheapskate- wouldn't run the dryer and dried the clothes on lines even in the winter and instead of using expensive maple syrup or regular syrup would give us corn syrup for pancakes in a bulk container.",

I was a very anxious child so naturally I started to panic a little bit. \nI pushed those feelings aside, and tried to focus on the movie, but there were loud noises coming from the passageway outside of her room.. noises like  metal clanging, thuds, yelling, etc.\n\nI grew very distressed at the commotion outside, and the fact that we were literally locked in a room from the outside, mind you, we were literal children. My friend, however, was completely unfazed. She kept watching the movie like nothing was happening.\n\nAt that point, I started to panic A LOT. So I got up and start banging on the door, pleading with her parents to let me out. Finally, the door unlocked and I stepped out into, I kid you not, a literal pool of blood.\n\nThe passage was quite literally flowing with blood. The walls were smeared with bloody handprints, etc.\nMy friends mother was standing right by the door with her head slightly lowered, but I could see her face very clearly. She had the bloodiest nose I had ever seen. I've never seen that much blood before in my life. She probably had other unseen wounds because I'm certain that amount of blood doesn't just come from a bloodied nose. The floor, walls, and their clothing ware covered in it \n\nThe bathroom at her house was directly infront on her room, only separated by the passage, and as I walk out I see her father sitting on the toilet with his pants down just staring at me and my friend. I have no doubt that he did this to my friends mother. \n\nMy friend had ushered me out since my mum had come to pick me up ( Thank GOD ) and I had to step over the bloodied floor in order to get to the front door.\n\nMy friend had absolutely no reaction to the scene we had just witnessed. She walked me out and gingerly asked when she was going to see me again like we didn't just walk over a crime scene. I asked if her mother was okay whilst we walked to the gate, and she replied with something along the lines of \" she'll be fine, this happens all the time \"\n\nI can still picture that whole ordeal vividly after years and years.  It's been so long and I still wonder if she's okay, and if she's realized just how fucked up that all was. I truly hope her and her mother are doing okay.",

            "text": "I was in my mid teens. Its a hot day and I'm at a friend's house, we are watching TV in the living room. To my shock, my friend's mom walks into the living room topless, no bra! She came in through to the left of the TV stand so i just had to turn my head a bit to see her. She must have been asleep because her eyes were puffy and hoarseness in her voice, walking slowly etc. This was around 2003 or 2004 so I had never ever seen anything like that in real life or online. Just a high school kid in an era of no smart phones. I was so confused. My mind was like \"oh shoot my parents will kill me for seeing this!\"lol.\n\nThe lady was in her late 40s I think. A big lady. She says hi to me and I'm like hi :-). Then she asks about my parents etc (she knew them). A chat that seemed to last so long as I stared at the TV. She kept blissfully asking and asking and I remember trying to act normal by trying to make eye contact. I aimed to look straight up into her eyes and i did. I did my best in being the most cultured kid under the circumstances. I was working so hard to act normal! Eventually she asks my friend for something and he replies. The HARDEST part is that the whole time, my friend's eyes were locked on me. I'm looking at the TV but I'm seeing both my friend on the right and his mom's saggy jugs via periphery vision on the left. After she left, I felt a mixture of shame and disappointment and i just wanted to leave. I don't remember what time I left.\n\nParents, try try to make sure your kids don't enter every home out there! \n\nLesson to the teen boys:\nEven as a grown man, if that was to happen to me now, seeing that would still make me feel horrible about myself. Strangely I didn't demean her as an indecent woman; the guilty feeling actually landed on me and idk why. But i think the lesson is that us men have an informal duty of preserving the integrity of women. In a way ladies are ALL other mothers and sisters. The feeling you will get for seeing a woman naked in real life is far more sobering and solemn than it appears on adult entertainment. It hurts. The guilt and damage which comes exposure kinda  relegated me from being a real alpha male candidate full of stature to being a pretender. Keep yourselves pure, your older selves will thank you for it!\nPeace, Africa2theWorld",

She had a little brother with obvious development issues and a pretty stressed mother, and a father that worked on the other side of the country, so he was only home doing weekends. I've never experienced a household with so much screaming and fighting. Both children was given everything they wanted, yet the big sister would push her brother around, and scream that it was her mother's fault when she told her to stop. Their mother would spend the whole week telling them to stop fighting, but then their father would come home and play fight with them. It always ended with one crying.

In a large room he used as the living room sat his recliner and behind it another very large room connected by a wide opening which I surmised was originally the dining room. This room was completely filled by a colossal pile of Budweiser cans, nearly six feet high! And the pile was teaming with German cockroaches, living off the remaining drops of beer in the cans. It seemed he’d bring a six pack of Bud to his recliner every day to unwind and just chucked the empty cans over his shoulder into the dining room.
