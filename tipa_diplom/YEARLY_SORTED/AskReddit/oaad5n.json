Here‚Äôs 2. \n\nSo I was just talking with some acquaintance, we were talking after coming back from a break. I wasn‚Äôt sure why she came up to talk to me though, we weren‚Äôt super good friends or anything. Later I find out it‚Äôs cause she was gonna ask me out. But we were talking about what happened over break and I said something along the lines of ‚Äúoh yeah I went back home to Europe, mostly stayed in Austria but went to Paris too‚Äù and she said the classic ‚Äúoh my gosh Paris! It‚Äôs so beautiful and romantic, I‚Äôve always wanted to go there!‚Äù Now that statement is probably why things happened the way they did. Paris is a disgusting city but Americans fangirl over it so hard. But yeah I went on to talking about how I visited Napoleon‚Äôs grave, and then spiralling into a history lecture about Napoleon which somehow led into a WW1 lecture and me going on about how Germany lost the war as soon as the Schiefflen Plan failed and they didn‚Äôt take Paris. Eventually she got bored and left (in a fairly polite manner compared to the responses I usually get to my history rants). My friend comes up to me later in the day and asks how the conversation went. I didn‚Äôt know what he meant, so he clued me in: she was gonna ask me out but I bored her away with Napoleon and the German Empire. \n\nStory 2. I was really good friends with this one girl and one day she comes up to me and seemingly out of the blue (I probably just missed the earlier clues, being the boring completely non romantic person I am) asked me about relationships and if I was in one/how I think I‚Äôd do in one. I don‚Äôt remember my response but I know for sure it was something stupid with a meme thrown in there (this was senior year of high school where my schizophrenia was getting real bad but it was completely untreated. I was pure chaos that year). Conversation moves on, I think nothing of it. Few weeks later she asks out a friend of mine and they start dating. Only then did I realise that she would‚Äôve asked me out had I not been a schizophrenic doofus. Yeah lots of experiences like that, but those are the worst of them. Experiences like those (and a few failed relationships) are why I‚Äôve now abandoned any idea of a relationship, and why I no longer go to parties or stuff like that and instead drown myself in 12 thousand hobbies I can‚Äôt all keep up with",

I feel the need to get this off my chest because it has been boiling for sometime. Please stop reading now if you are not open to ideas of gender/sexual equality. \n\nI understand that this is a innocent joke and all, however, imagine the reverse; suggesting that their genitalia makes women inferior in anyway is liable to get that person lynched. Yet here we see an example of reverse sexism played off as a joke. Please give me a moment to explain. If this were a joke about women‚Äôs mental capacity and their genitalia, the post (and the OP) would‚Äôve been murdered. Feminism (perhaps it would have been better named as equalism? Idk) - the idea of sexual/gender EQUALITY - is definitely something to be pursued, but we need to see BOTH sides of the issue. Men are portrayed as brute dumbos and women as emotional train wrecks. No. We are humans, we can be both regardless of our gender. It is a disservice to all genders/sexes to not recognise this",

As an American who had not seen much the world yet, they were exotic to me which gave them extra points in my book.\n\nAnyway, they're staying at a hotel not far from mine, so after the cruise thing was over and I was properly sloshed, as were my parents, I go back to their hotel to keep the party going. It's just me and 6 other big girls partying up in this hotel room. I ended up essentially being the \"entertainment\" and was coerced to do all kinds of crazy things like sharing shots by taking a swig and spitting it into their mouths, doing body shots off of their breasts, and stripping for them. I eventually ended up sleeping with one of them and very much did not use a condom. Also mind you, these girls were like, young to mid 20s as well so they were most likely quite fertile. I potentially have a teenage child somewhere in Europe.\n\nIt's funny, because re-telling this story, it actually is a really crazy story that some what sounds awesome (since all parties of course were consenting adults, albeit I was both barely an adult and barely coherent enough to fully consent)\n\nI've always considered it a regretful time but, it's actually kind of nifty thinking back to it now.",

John Edwards, some may not know, was the VP candidate in 2004 under Kerry, and placed second in the Iowa caucuses in 2008 behind Obama.\n\nJohn Edwards hired a filmmaker who flirted with him at a bar to create a documentary on the campaign. Staff questioned as to why her, and why did she need to go everywhere with him, but he insisted that she had to for the documentary. Of course, they were fucking. Now you may say, wasn't he married at the time? Yes, of course. Married to Elizabeth Edwards who had breast cancer which had returned during the campaign. His wife was a public figure who called for healthcare reform and was a major part of his campaign. At first, it was just in tabloids, National Inquirer stuff, who was this mystery woman following John Edwards everywhere? With tons of speculation on the affair, no mainstream outlets picked it up. That changed however, when the filmmaker began showing signs of pregnancy.\n\nJohn Edwards immediately had her moved to a house, along with a staffer and the staffer's wife. The staffer was promised a big position if Edwards' campaign was successful, as long as he could keep the filmmaker inside to protect Edwards from further media speculation. He even asked the staffer to \"Get a doctor to fake the DNA results ... and to steal a diaper from the baby so he could secretly do a DNA test to find out if this [was] indeed his child.\" On top of that, he later asked the staffer to claim paternity over the child. \n\nThe whole story is wild; sadly Elizabeth Edwards passed from breast cancer in 2010 (but not before divorcing John Edwards' ass.) \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edwards_extramarital_affair",

I wasn't \"getting there\" while I was on top, and we traded places with me on bottom. I was unusually winded, and unconsciously kept up the fast breathing while I was on bottom. I really wanted to finish but there was nothing mentally arousing me, and there were numerous check ins on \"if I was close\" that were pushing me in the wrong direction.\n\nStill heavily breathing and not really \"aware\" of it, I started to notice a reaction in her and got the desperate hope in me that some sign of her pleasure at what I was doing would put me over the edge. I started to work my hips in sync, and match thrusts to the reactions she was having. My energy increased as did my rapid breathing, and I started to get a numb feeling descending from my scalp, to my face to.......\n\n*slap*\n\n\"Did I lose you dude?\"\n\nThe hyperventilating stopped and the dizziness/numbness faded as a powerful headache took its place. I had that momentary sense of dread that accompanies unexpected unconsciousness. My lightsaber made that soft *zzrrrpp* sound in that way that terror seems to be the opposite of viagra. \n\nWhat happened: I hyperventilated during some vigorous, *finish it already* sex. Blood vessels in my neck constricted, and I literally had only enough blood to run my brain or penis--not both.\n\nWhat happened later: Headaches for a couple weeks, a few doctor's visits to make sure it wasn't anything serious and I'm fine. \n\nWhat happened much later:  In a healthy relationship, happy, and got pregnant first month we tried to conceive.",
