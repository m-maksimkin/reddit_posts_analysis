Also both of my kids were drinking milk and then both decided to have water, so they went to the cup cabinet to get new cups when I reminded them, “y’know... you HAVE cups, and need to rinse them out and keep using them so we don’t end up with a full dishwasher load of cups at the end of the day” - which happens every day, and today was no different. And some fucking how, beyond my imagination of what could cause this other than defiance, when I want the front door to be closed, my youngest child bless their soul will open the door and stand there for several minutes deciding whether to go in or out, door wide open, until I say, “IN OR OUT?” which causes a panic and several more minutes of uncertainty.

For example, 350-400F is suitable for so many things, and it’ll be based on how long, not necessarily how high the heat is. But if you’re ever unsure, set a temperature and just keep an eye on whatever you’re cooking. EVERYONE’S OVEN IS DIFFERENT.
