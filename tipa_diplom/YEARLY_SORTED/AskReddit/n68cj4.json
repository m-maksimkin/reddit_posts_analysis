Cancel culture, especially when none of the accusations are true, ruins people’s lives and the folks that did the canceling and the doxxing have absolutely no repercussions. I’ve seen some discussions around this but one of the things that drove it home for me was kind of unexpected: in a docuseries on Elisa Lam they interview the metal head guy people were accusing of murdering Lam. They bullied him, doxxed him, got him banned from social media in general (including getting his YouTube deleted which had all of the music he’d been making for years). He tried to commit suicide. And when it came out the “clues” people were claiming as evidence for his involvement were completely unfounded they moved on. This guy was utterly broken and he never got even an apology. There are entire YouTube channels built off of that case with video evidence, posted by them, with thousands of comments destroying this man’d life.

My ex boyfriend wanted to Snapchat for hours a night whilst I had shit to get done and then he’d get annoyed when I didn’t respond. Or my best friend was so reliant and needy on her ex she would stress when they didn’t talk everyday. Like I don’t get it. 1) what do they have to talk about all the time and 2) has everyone forgotten about ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’? Like it is much nicer to have a deep long conversation with someone after a week of not seeing them than to have vapid empty snap conversations with someone just for the sake of it.\n\nAlso, might get hate for this one, but not being allowed to dislike dogs. I live in UK where it’s becoming more and more common to have a dog/cat to the point were I’m the only person in my middle class friend group who hasn’t got one. And I don’t like either of them for two reasons. 1) I’m really allergic to pet dander so when your untrained mutt is jumping all over me that’s breaking out my skin in hives and making it hard to breathe. 2) I’ve been attacked by three separate dogs throughout my life. I’m only 19 but those three memories are some of my most vivid memories so I’m sorry if I get nervous when your crusty dog starts yapping. Also I feel as though people don’t train their dogs well. Like, because everyone is expected to like dogs owners don’t train them to not jump on strangers but for me having a dog jump at me is deeply distressing and then the owner gets annoyed that I didn’t like it like what?? \n\nFinally, I dislike the fact that you can’t hold an opinion about something if you don’t belong to the group that opinion is about. I wouldn’t have a problem with this if it weren’t for the fact there is so much misinformation spread on the internet and people are really shocking at doing their own research. It blows my mind.\n\nAnd this is a side note but it’s kinda funny - got called a coloniser by a Japanese-American on TikTok. I’m Irish living in the last six occupied counties of Ireland.

People feel that they have to like or comment so they are not monsters. They can't say \"weird looking kid\" or anything negative or otherwise they are monsters as well. The minute you see a post with someones child, you need to just roll your eyes and click to avoid conflict so you are being held hostage by the poster so to speak.\n- It's your profile, but not you that is getting attention. How is it different than just posting random handsome men or beautiful women on your profile to get likes?\n- You are using someone without their will. They can't even decide how they feel about the picture. Something cute for you can be embarassing to your child and if they wish to hide it, it's their right to do so. Imagine if that embarassing picture from the family album you hate was seen by the whole world.\n-  You have little to gain, and your child might pay for it. Your child might get teased about the picture or video for your internet points. What if they wanted to get out of a nasty situation and lied about their whereabouts to a kid at school that you just exposed?\n- What if your post gets 5 likes because you posted it while a popular TV show was on and your friends post of their child gets 50 likes because they posted it after the show? How will your child feel about the difference in likes?",

This is largely a problem online (go figure, since we're all at home right now), but I see *so many* people making \"you need to hear this RIGHT NOW\" posts or replying to posts calling the OP all sorts of -isms based on very little evidence. \n\nI've seen so many takes repeated despite having no real legs to stand on, and it's infuriating. So many of them are \"oh my friend from this group said this, I'm just elevating their voice\", too. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with speaking your mind about something, but at least put in the due research to know what you're talking about. Giving consequences to your child is not abuse. Stop saying it is. Not eating a vegan lifestyle doesn't make you racist. Yes, I've seen it. \n\nNot every twitter account needs to make a black lives matter post. Those who do don't need to donate their fortune to various charities or GoFundMes. You can support something without broadcasting that to the world, and that applies to others, too. \n\nThe one that annoys me the most has to be the \"celebrity, why aren't you speaking up about _____” tweets. They don't owe you anything, nor do they live on social media. Chill. The fuck. Out. Focus on what really matters and give others a break online. \n\n\"Cancelling\" people falls under here for me pretty often too. PewDiePie said a slur once, therefore he must be a racist nazi, and if you watch him you're a racist nazi too. If you like anime where you don't know the character's ages, you're a PEDOPHILE.

It's become a huge trend to get offended over something a celebrity (or just anyone who has a social media account of any kind) said or did, even if it wasn't that major. Of course I'm mostly talking about the celebrity incidents, but there have been other not-so-famous people who've been chewed out over a simple joke some 2 year olds couldn't understand. This is also specificly targeted at Twitter, which is why I don't (and probably never will) have it. Some people decide they want to be sucky, trash bags of a human, I understand, but seriously, cancel culture is the absolute worst. Now it's a different story if that celebrity or non-famous person actually did some offensive shiz and didn't genuinely apologize for it. That, we can get mad over. Anything minor should just be ignored like it always had been before 2020 happened.",

Because there is so little that can be said in a single tweet, and further tweets in a chain are generally hidden, the format itself encourages sound bites (or the visual equivalent... text bites?) over more complex conversation.\n\nThis format makes actual discussion difficult and tedious, thus discouraging it in favor of just yelling the loudest and getting the most likes to superficially back up whatever you just said. It encourages Twitter users to basically shut out civil discussion and debate, eliminate nuanced conversation and opinions, and avoid anything that takes more than two sentences to comprehensively explain.\n\nI'm noticing this trend spreading to other forms of social media, as well. TikTok is another site that is heavily characterized by its brevity, and I know it's one that younger people (kids/teens) like to use. I think that this could be very dangerous for kids if they're being socialized predominantly through social media, especially since we're still at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic and we pretty much *have* to communicate online for consistent social interaction.\n\nEssentially, I'm concerned about platforms like Twitter and TikTok teaching people -- especially kids and teenagers -- to devalue comprehensive information and complex/nuanced perspectives in favor of who can spew out the snappiest sound bite or comeback.",

Students reported him to the direction because it was considered as if he was doing a black face. \nFfs the guy decided to disguise as a celebrity he liked and a black one as that and he went full in!! How is it disrespectful towards black people to disguise as a black singer you liked all the way to skin color! To me it feels like on the contrary you’re acknowledging his skin color and what he did and at the same time showing you support black culture! so isn’t that kind of spreading the thought that there are great black artists and encouraging them?\n\nTo go back on the “trend” question, it also feels like so much of this intolerance towards people trying to represent other cultures doesn’t always comes from the victims. There so many white people for exemple that start movements against words and images that THEY believe to be racist towards other cultures and they do it because they are entitled and want to look as “activists” while they’ve never actually been in the same boat.\n\nSide Note: Please for the love of god if you don’t agree with me: tell me why!

If you are not productive or not trying to be more productive, you are perceived to be lazy and not a valued worker/student. I hate all these YouTube videos showing that a person's whole day is filled with tasks and they don't seem to really rest and have time for entertainment. The truth is that people have less control over their productivity than they believe. As a person struggling with clinical depression and several chronic conditions still waiting for official diagnoses,  I certainly want to be more productive, but my health must allow me to do so at first.\n2. Weight stigma and diet culture. Everybody with any body shape and size is dieting, especially women, though more and more men are doing this too. There are possibly more fad diets than any time period in history. Judging food by its nutritional value is not enough; they are either \"poison\" (for relatively less nourishing foods) or \"medicine\" (for relatively more nourishing ones). Exercising is no longer about feeling refreshed, but pursuing the perfect and only \"normal\" body shape that is actually unrealistic, or not being bashed by family, friends, coworkers and even doctors. And oh, doctors! They and other healthcare professionals are one of the largest groups of perpetrators of weight stigma, basically blaming every health issue of a fat person on their weight. God knows how many people are killed in this way. \"Diet or sick and die\" is the word fat people hear in the doctor's office repeatedly. If you are concerned with diseases *associated* with obesity, here are two facts: first, current medical research shows that the relationship between these conditions and body weight is more complex than previously thought, and **correlation does not imply causation**; second, the only thing dieting can do is make you fatter.\n3. Misanthropy and pessimism about the future all over the place, especially in environmental activism. Environmentalism used to be a part of human rights advocacy for the sake of a better life and a more equal society. Now it's largely replaced by fear unless it's in disadvantaged communities or poor countries. Words like \"humans are parasites of Earth\" are now common, and increasing used against people of colour and people in extreme poverty. I was not born and raised in the West (although I currently live in the UK), so I have no idea whether apocalypticism is a new thing in environmental and climate activism. What I know is that this biblical analogy is highly oversimplified and inaccurate. As I know more information about apocalyptic cults, I start to ask myself the question \"Am I in a cult?\" again and again. When I put the question into climate activism and environmentalism in the West, I start to become uncomfortable. Our activism is botched, and it is not gonna work in this way.",

People who think automatically, with no other information, that if you’re not part of one group, then you’re dog shit.\n\nAnd here comes the reason why we can’t ever have a conversation about this topic: trumpism. Trump divided us right down the middle with his inflammatory language, his divisive rhetoric, and his “if you’re not with me, then you’re the problem” attitude. He was president for 50% of the country rather than all of it. He only served his supporters, and in return you get people that say things like “kill all democrats” and “typical lib cuck” and “conservatives are trash” and “GQP” with the important distinction that REAL conservatives has nothing to do with trump, and it’s just coincidence that all his grabass buddies are in the party, which has already itself turned into the party of trump. \n\nIf someone wants to have a discussion about limiting government spending and lowering tax rates, they should be able to without being lumped in with a man who basically committed war crimes. Mostly because that person isn’t trump, and they’re just a hard working American who has a set of beliefs that they’re entitled to. \n\nIf someone wants to tell someone that black lives indeed do matter and black people should be shot by the police even though they were complying, they should be able to without some red-hat wearing psychopath parroting Fox News talking points and doing that weird thing they do and take every insult created towards them around and just saying the same thing about liberals (rEnT fReE).\n\nObviously I’m biased here, but to quote every 6 year old ever, “they started it!”",

My girlfriend and I can call out with at least 90% accuracy who is on their phone. \n\nAbrupt Lane changes, 20mph under the speed limit, swerving, looking at phone and missing a green light for 5+ seconds, and - my personal pet peeve - stopping 50’ short of a light in a busy intersection during rush hour. \n\nNot only is the use common, but the entitlement that comes with it is across the board. Someone waiting at a green light 5+ seconds, I do a short honk to alert them - they give me middle finger. Like, yeah, I’m the fucking idiot here (I can see you playing on your phone through your back windshield). \n\nThe other day I had a girl pull across two rows  of parked cars in a lot and had to slam on my brakes to not smash into her. Instead of saying sorry, she got out of the car (still in the middle of the lane) while still on FaceTime to film me. \n\nLike... it’s gotten so bad that I don’t see any real solution other than videoing all of these people/license plates and sending them to the local police.\n\nEDIT: [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/n6g06x/to_make_people_think_you_werent_drivingin_a_car/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)is what perpetuates this kind of behavior",

By ‘Fascism’ they mean, roughly speaking, something cruel, unscrupulous, arrogant, obscurantist, anti-liberal and anti-working-class. Except for the relatively small number of Fascist sympathizers, almost any English person would accept ‘bully’ as a synonym for ‘Fascist’. That is about as near to a definition as this much-abused word has come.\n\nBut Fascism is also a political and economic system. Why, then, cannot we have a clear and generally accepted definition of it? Alas! we shall not get one — not yet, anyway. To say why would take too long, but basically it is because it is impossible to define Fascism satisfactorily without making admissions which neither the Fascists themselves, nor the Conservatives, nor Socialists of any colour, are willing to make. All one can do for the moment is to use the word with a certain amount of circumspection and not, as is usually done, degrade it to the level of a swearword.\n\n... And that is what George Orwell had tot say about that in 1944. We find ourselves now, 75 years later, and the word has surely degenerated into a common insult.\n\n[George Orwell - What Is Fascisme?](https://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/efasc)",

Meanwhile I knew friends making $11 an hour working in patient care roles in hospitals. Yes, if you end up making $11 an hour after taking out student debt that is a decent case for forgiveness. But people I knew who were actual doctors felt entitled to loan forgiveness. The fact that people in very high paid professions have the gall to demand student loan forgiveness is astounding. It's equivalent to when rich people would just walk away from an investment property that went under or declare bankruptcy strategically after the 2008 crash.

Art does not exist in a vacuum, sure, and the context of the artist makes a difference.

Complete anonymity with ability to say whatever you want to other people, with feelings, only leads to mass negativity and hate. The app right from the start sucks you in with small dopamine stimulants like aesthetics ,and notifications, the ability to get followers and likes that ultimately amount to nothing and have no meaning.”\nSocial media brings out the worst in people. You can post death threats, hate speech, political propaganda extremely quickly, efficiently and easily with no consequences. And what’s truly astonishing is that we stick with it *by choice*. It is our decision to keep the app and use it. I cannot believe day after day I would scroll through meaningless, hate, politics, clickbait, follow bait, boring shit in general and decided that it was all worth it just to browse Instagram. It’s not. Not at all. I wish other people would see this too....",

We get it, you did something that makes you feel like a good person. But adoption often starts with trauma for the child, and these adoptive parents are way too open to sharing the child’s story about what happened to them pre-adoption. That just simply isn’t their story to tell, but they get praised up and down for it. And when adoptees speak out about how they feel about it, they’re told to “be grateful”...like they asked to be adopted.",

Before we invented fancy doo-dads like telescopes, we were free to practice the sacred alchemical bonding between siblings, but now that *SCIENTISTS* created the field of genetics out of thin air, suddenly I can't do the tantric magick with my liberated life partner! This is an outrage! We've been kissing since at least middle scool, and monogamous a few years later, so its not like either of us is getting hurt. Friggin kings and queens and other gendered monarchs used to have all sorts of incestual relationships, and all that happened wad some of there offspring got porphyric hemophilia, which is good as long as they don't go out in the sunlight to much.

They are called \"nerds\", \"dorks\" and other insults and are frequently bullied as kids.  As adults, smart people are considered less desirable as romantic partners for whatever stupid reason.  For example, I dated this girl about 15 years ago, and on our first date, when I told her I was an engineer, she totally lost interest because she thought engineers are boring.  The only reason she continued dating me is because I told her I smoke weed.  That got her interested again and we had a relationship for 7 months.

Modern computers and software enable one white collar worker to be on average as efficient as six or seven pre-computer counterparts. Over the next fifteen years, Oxford is estimating that nearly the entire low-skill low-wage labor market is going to be automated thanks to advances in AI. We're not talking about the automation of one job or one industry (as with the farm tractor or the cotton gin), we're talking about the wholesale automation of an entire category of labor. It's not like they can just move to the city and get a factory job-- all the factories are getting automated. Chinese factories, notorious for being too cheap for even humane working conditions, have even started losing labor out to robots.\n\nThere's three laws to automation you need to consider:\n\n1. There is no task a human can do which a sufficiently complex machine cannot.\n\n2. Whether a given labor is automated is dictated by the costs of the sufficiently complex machine.\n\n3. Increasingly complex machines continuously become more economical.\n\nAt some point, the cost of the machine outcompetes even slave labor (the cost to keep a human alive). I wouldn't trust the fortune 500 not to sell their grandma for a nickle and a handful of candy corn, I certainly don't expect them to suddenly grow a conscience when it comes to preserving jobs from automation. This problem isn't coming; if you accept that automation is what's kept wages flat since the 70's, it's already here, and it's about to get a hell of a lot worse. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm  sure that doing nothing and hoping it all works out is more than probably the worst possible choice at this point. People aren't going to quietly starve to death, and they sure aren't going to let their kids quietly starve to death just because they got lectured to about how socialism is bad. There's still time for the free market to develop solutions and return to an outlook that balances the interests of customers, investors, and workers instead of strictly focusing on investors...\n\nBut I'm not holding my breath.",

People is the most obvious one since everyone here knows how Instagram, Twitch, yt, and every social media works. Also animals are pretty obvious one since animal trafficking is one of the 3 illegal business that more money generates, and celebrities and rich people are into buying exotic animals just to show them off or going to their continent to hunt them. But places is a specially hurtful one for me. I love travelling and i really have a good time doing so, but every place you go just feels like a product, everything prepared for tourism and make you spend money, and if you decide to not stick to the tourist places usually locals are eager to make you feel integrated even if you're in your own country. Just you see social media and travelling feels like something mandatory, it looks like a race where everyone is trying to take the fanciest photo, doing nothing but generating insane amounts of pollution and slowly degenerating historical places and nature, and selling certain cultures like if they were a product. In conclusion, massive tourism is a serious deal in climate change but nobody talks about it bc there are places which only can live out of that and during the pandemic it was proved. Also pandemic showed lots of people having anxiety issues over not travelling, and people risking catch corona just to take photos of themselves out there. From my point of view we should really enjoy our surroundings more and stop idealizing this craze of trying to step on every inch of the world and take a picture of it, I'd rather travel less and enjoy it more. Capitalism really hurting the world. I don't think nobody's reading all of this but if you did, thanks",

To me that is the height of irresponsibility.  You have your first kid, you budget for insurance.  I’ve been paying life insurance for many years because it’s the right thing to do & I do not want to leave my loved ones in dire straits.

The woman who first had a gender reveal party had gone through many miscarriages before. And before I go on, I want to highlight how deeply traumatic miscarriages are for expecting mothers.\n\nThe remains of the child still have to come out of you, somehow. Think about the grossness of that scene while also dealing with the emotional fallout of no longer having an incipient baby. It's dark shit. And I know that when I was younger, I just didn't really consider that aspect of miscarriages. As a guy, it was just a word to me. And experience with people who have miscarried opened my eyes up to how traumatic miscarriages are.\n\nMany women who struggle with multiple miscarriages will stop announcing that they're pregnant, for what I hope are obvious reasons. So this woman kept her pregnancy secret cause she didn't want to have to then also announce a miscarriage. Or rather, everyone slowly awkwardly learn what happened in whispers, well after the fact.\n\nBut finding out the baby's gender comes at an important milestone in the development of the fetus. I don't know all the details, but apparently once you reach that milestone, miscarriages are a lot less common.\n\nSo this woman reached that milestone, and decided to throw the world's first gender reveal party. But really, it was also a pregnancy announcement, and potentially the reveal of how she and he child had overcome great odds. \n\nAnd now it's a way for rich people to burn down forests.",

I like being able to watch educational things, and learn about groups of people and cultures and topics I might never even consider. I'm not really a master of many topics, but I know a little about a lot of different things, in a way that I don't think I could otherwise. I like being able to connect with the people in my life who are important to me even when we aren't together. I like the funny memes.\n\nBut it feels like there is just so much emphasis on \"content creation\" and Instagram/tiktok/ whatever new platforms there are. It's like every person I know curates all these profiles for themselves. And if you want to be involved in real life groups, especially anything to do with social justice, you need to be active on those platforms. And it just feels so hollow to me. Do this, follow that format, get people to share and like. What message is actually being pushed? You can make a difference by preaching to the choir via easily digestible images? I simply don't feel engaged in those ways. It never occurs to me to take photos of where I am and what I'm doing. Privacy aside, I just don't feel any desire to do it. Reddit feels different, almost like I'm recording conversations I have with people. But I am not sharing my reddit at all with the things and people I have in real life. \n\nI am mentoring some high schoolers through environmental justice projects. And almost all are opting to do a social media campaign. They can't break away from this idea of having an audience that includes the entire world to focus on issues at home. In some ways, it's good to have global consciousness. But it feels like there is nothing local.\n\nI've listened to some people who were important/founding members of certain environmental movements or groups when they've come to speak at classes I'm taking. They all mention the formative conversations, gatherings, and trips that got them on that path. And I feel nostalgic for it even though I've never experienced it. It seems so... Something, to just be able to get with a group of like-minded people, and make a plan, and start doing, making some mistakes and learning from them and building as you gain experience. I want that. But to get into those spaces now, you need to be competitive, and you need to be networked, and that means this social media world is something I really have to get into and understand, and it's so soul draining. And even once you're in, it feels like all the work you do is about image. Everything is image.\n\nI'm not old. I'm still in college.

There are folks who show their appreciation for the jobs I and my esteemed colleagues provide to our communities daily by giving us a smile, a wave, or donating to our air ambulance charity. These folks are always thankful and appreciative even when we do not expect them to be (and especially in spite of the fact that validation is truly very important in any profession).\n2. \"The Clappening\", as I have come to call it, only felt genuine the first couple of times, particularly where it concerned Sir Tom Moore's effort to support our criminally underfunded health service. After that, it felt like the manufactured \"feel good\" commercialism you see in those Coke commercials or in those videos of people giving homeless folks a ton of money or food\n3. Finally: So many of the people doing it only did it to look trendy. The NHS has been screaming for help for decades and nobody batted a bloody eye. It took a 100-year-old World War Two veteran endeavouring through a heartwarming charitable goal for folks to take notice of our fallen colleagues and our overburdened health system... and so they showed their faux appreciation by banging pots and pans and shouting and clapping for us at 7pm each evening.\n\nIt just makes me so mad, I hope that that doesn't make me seem like a prick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I've even forgotten what bloody time it was that they did it, that's how much it irked me.",

Specifically, a lot of people in recent years have reverted back to defending cyberbullying, bitchy behavior, and victim blaming.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of people online say things like “well if you don’t want to be bullied then don’t be annoying,” or “I don’t need to be nice to anyone,” etc. \n\nA lot of it is rooted in ableism and super in group-y. We shouldn’t normalize being mean to people just because we don’t like them. Unless someone does something mean to you, you shouldn’t be mean to them. I don’t know why people have forgotten this lately. Especially with all of the school shootings going on in America. \n\nI just don’t think people should act unkindly without reason. It’s a negative, miserable way to live, and as someone who was bullied for my disability it’s really disheartening to see people try to defend and normalize this behavior.",

I usually wouldn't be one to say someone is faking a disorder especially Tourette's because everyone's tics are different so you can't really tell much but these people are obviously faking. I've even seen people admit to it like there was this one video they were faking a whole bunch of stuff it was a fidget video and it said \"Hi this is (name) and (friends name) we both have severe ADHD, anxiety, depression, and Tourette's\" They were obviously faking It but then someone else duetted the video I know they were trying to help but they were acting like they knew everything about Tourette's, they didn't if anything they're making everything worse. To be honest I don't think anyone should have duetted that video because that just gave those kids what they wanted, attention they shouldn't have duetted that they should have just left it alone and reported it. But anyway this person duetted the video and I know they were trying to help as I already said that, but they spread more misinformation it if anything made everything worse they said \"Tourette's is rare.\" Which it's not there's over 200,000 cases of Tourette's and that's just in the U.S. worldwide I don't know what it would be but it would be a humongous number they also said that \"If you have Tourette's you would be swearing uncontrollably.\" only 10% of people with Tourette's swear and also we don't tic every second of our lives they also said some other stuff but it's been awhile since I watched that video since I just chose to ignore it.

We'd play SNES all day, eat pizza, jump on the trampoline, play in the pool, and talk about why GI Joes were the coolest. Then we'd plead to sleep over.\n\nMy son is the same age, and when I asked him if he wanted to go see his two best friends (used to play with them all the time), he said no thanks and wanted to just go to the park to look at the birds (He's super into them these days). We forced him to go out, and he had a *great* time, but I still think he'd probably just settle to be home alone.\n\nMy daughter used to be a social belle, and now she has meltdowns when she's around other kids, and we've had to coax her back into being the extrovert she used to be.

They also told me that because it's outside of the lease period that they legally can't sell  me the phone.  My options are to continue paying an extra $32/month in perpetuity or trade it in for a new one.  I've now unwittingly paid probably $1,700+ for a phone that I can't ever own.

How many \"Instafamous\" people are out there?

There are too many people who have turned to social media to fill a need in their soul to be liked and accepted and that sucks. People who are susceptible to this on social media are too dependent upon people, who they have never met outside of the internet, accepting them, liking them, and giving them praise. It's a toxic gratification that, I feel, does potentially more damage to a person than it does lift them up.\n\nI dunno... I'm glad I didn't get too deep into it all.

Just those people on tik tok or Instagram in general. \n\nI went to a memorial service to honor fallen miners and while I was getting things ready some girls show up and claim to be models. They wanted to model I chased them away.\n\nThe memorial was at a graveside where the oldest grave was from 1605. Its cool. And dead people deserve rest. There are actual profiles for 'models' where they pose on graves, wear lingerie on graves, twerk on graves, or Gothic posing. These so called models have been caught time and time again desecrating these graves to build an aesthetic. Leave that poor man who's been dead 200 years alone. \n\nI've seen people stealing poems and claiming it as there's, or these # this disaster with their nude. \n\nDefacing property and pranking homeless people are not top tier pranks. Like what are these people gonna do when they go into the workforce and their employer sees that they like to feed homeless people toothpaste oreos or kicking over baby graves so they can twerk?",

(And none of it is important things like, personality traits etc) And they turn down guys left and right because they've been taught that \"you deserve the best\" or whatever... Like not even 5% of the male population meets those requirements, and 90% cant go after  the <5% with everyone being happy in the end.\n\n And those that DO meet the requirements don't want some average or slightly above average female long term. And those guys don't have to even try to bed them, they can bed a different girl every night for a year and all it does is destroy the self esteem of all the girls they've slept with. \"I was with an 8, 9 or 10 once, I can do it again and this time I'll keep him.\" No, you won't. The dude has 10,000 options, and what you bring to the table very likely doesn't move you to the front of the line.\n\nBut a guy turns down a girl for ANY reason (whatever that reason is) and suddenly he is misogynistic and a jerk because something didn't align. \n\nOr how guys are bad for enjoying attractive women in movies, tv, and video games, but women are just fine, or even encouraged, to oggle and cheer for and whistle at scantily clad hot dudes in tv, advertisements, etc.\n\nI also hate how companies treat their employees like shit even if they're hard workers who do the best they can. Working for many companies these days is like a new form of underpaid slavery.\n\nIf you're a female who is in your 20s or 30s and you're frustrated because you can't find a \"good guy\", get your head out of the clouds, face reality, and lower your damn standards, or turn into a lonely cat lady. Your choice.\n\nAs a nice guy who was raised well and is a geek, and who has been burned many times by the opposite sex, and who is also not perfect, I'm pretty much done with trying to find a girlfriend. I have chronic depression and loneliness and a general sense of apathy (thanks in part to working retail for 15 years), so that's fun now.\n\nI've learned that it's better to be an introvert and a loner with a small handful of good friends, than to drive one's self to insanity trying to find \"love\".

I don't need you shoving it down my ear drums thanks. \n2. A lot of people are too nice these days in my opinion. If someone says something rude, instead of saying it's not right to say these things (nicely), they say, \"Oh.\" and then avoid the person. If the person who's being rude doesn't realize they're being rude because no one tells them (and they don't self reflect), then nothing is ever going to change. \n3. The lack of reading I guess. If you never read, you usually don't develop cognitively to be able to do deep thinking and self actualize. Plus you're more susceptible to manipulation, adopting other people's opinions and don't tend to recognize when someone's giving sly insults. \n\nThis is just what I think.",

I spend a good amount of Tiktok because of my job on a marketing team, and it's horrifying how many young people are casually getting cosmetic surgery because of the amount of pressure there is to look like a perfect filter. Showing off your before/after nose job is an actual trend now -- it has its own hashtag. Everyone is getting the same tiny button nose, which leaves out a lot of ethnicities and is alienating people with anything other than the ideal shape. Not to mention, many teens can't afford it, and end up feeling miserable about themselves.\n\nI feel like cosmetic surgery in general is a no-win situation. People judge you if they think you look ugly, people judge you for getting surgery, or they judge you if you have naturally ideal features because they assume you had surgery. Plus, beauty trends are always changing.\n\nI've wanted a nose job my whole life because I was born with a legit crooked nose -- people have asked if I broke it -- but am choosing not to because I'm so upset over the amount of people who feel bad about the way they look and think they have to fix something.

Bicycles and other vehicles that run on human power are perfectly fine\n* ALL business flights regarding meetings immediatley banned video conferencing is absolutley fine. Flights would only be for cargo and holidayers\n* ALL household appliances manufactured in this climate emergency must last a minimum of 50 years, any that fail to do so will incur the company a 35% fine from profits.\n* ALL tech items from USB sticks all the way up to PC's must last at least 20 years, batteries not included :D but the device MUST be able to be updated for the full 20 yrs, meaning that an OS change cannot render an item useless, as above a fine but of 50% of profits if company fails.\n* ALL countries must provide solar panels free of charge to every dwelling within their domain, scandinavian countries are more than likely nearly there.\n\nThe fact that none of these are even close to being implemented with the exception of solar panels  will tell you that there is no climate emergency.

I’ve been called selfish for posting screenshots of my workouts (running & biking times/paces) or narcissistic for sharing my shirtless physique in front of a mirror, but some fitness dude living in Dubai posts the same type of shit but since he’s hotter, wealthier, extremely popular, and on a sandy beach, it gets praised. It’s just very telling to see how people respond to similar kinds of content but coming from different people. The Rock stands in his gym and talks to the camera to sell you his new energy drink for 3 minutes and it’s like it’s Jesus in the flesh. If I stood in the gym and talked to my camera for 3 minutes it would likely end up as ‘nobody cares buddy’. So, it’s not much of a social trend as much as it is human nature, but it definitely bothers me a little that people give so much weight and attention to the things already famous people do and don’t equally balance that attention to the people doing similar things but that aren’t famous themselves.",

I am known for giving “the Irish goodbye”, and it’s not because I’m rude... it’s because I’m dreading someone hugging me. One of my sister’s is a “hugger”, but she ALWAYS asks people first.

It asserts that you should be well, content, healthy, happy, and living in abundance ALL OF THE TIME, which is actually incredibly unhealthy because we are human and experience a wide range of emotions outside of happiness even when life is going fairly well. Wellness culture asserts that “negative” emotions are a clear sign that things are critically wrong, that we ourselves are living poorly, and that we need to make big changes in order to relieve ourselves of ~toxicity~. I call bullshit. Life can be tough sometimes. We have bad days even when we’re living good lives. The best of people will disappoint us. We don’t have to move to Fiji, become yoga instructors, buy $50 face masks, and abandon our partners to achieve some fantasy of perpetual happiness. \n\nI would also argue that there are no “bad” emotions. Be sad. To get through it, ya gotta go through it. People suffer. Let it inform you, but don’t rearrange your entire life to avoid the tough stuff because it’s inevitable. \n\nHaving spent a decade of my life in therapy recovering from various traumas, I’ve learned that wellness culture isn’t about mental wellness at all. It’s a toxic, impossible fantasy. The point is to be equipped to handle hard stuff and work through it, not run in the opposite direction the moment something tough comes up. \n\nAnd the MONEY. Jesus fucking Christ the money. Don’t buy that $50 face mask. It’s not gonna change your life. Therapy and good people will. The end.",

I’ve seen people recording themselves stopping a crime and that’s obviously helped bring awareness on the attacker/robber/etc. \n\nBut then you’ve got the Karens (oversimplification, a lot of people do it) of the world who **feel the need** to record every public conversation they have, particularly when things go south. I saw a video a few months ago of how a guy was doing some burning (for his faith) near public housing, so one of the (understandably) annoyed residents went out and chided him for it. But obviously, we live in a world where your **camera** is more important that the shit you say, so the conversation was a bit insensitive and unfair on both sides. But hey, recorded for social media to judge, so win!\n\nBut by far the worst for me is the millions of videos you see of people doing good. Giving a poor kid your collection of Jordans? **Record it**. Giving a homeless guy free snacks from your store? **Record it**, even though as a cashier employed there why the hell are you recording your customers’ faces in the first place? Basically any good deed of the day you do **has to be recorded**. **WHOLESOME CONTENT!**... if you ignore the fact someone had a camera pushed into their face from nowhere. \n\nIt almost feels as if sincerity is an illusion in society now, since the camera recording is apparently **more important** than the helping.

There‘s nothing that fosters apathy, depression, and burnout more than demanding that we all live in a state of hyper awareness and outrage about every injustice everywhere all the time, regardless about if we can actually do something about it. \n\nI’m not saying people shouldn’t be aware of injustice. Awareness and knowledge are the first steps towards action and change — you can’t protest and change what you don’t know about. But insisting that I have to be mad about everything wrong all the time or I’m a horrible person? I cannot live like that; my mental health can’t handle it, and many people are the same. Insisting that everyone live in a state of constant anger or moral panic about something is not helpful in the slightest — it wastes energy that could be spent on actual positive change. \n\nUnfortunately the internet thrives on anger and negativity. It’s so easy to say “OMG THIS IS SO WRONG AND HORRIBLE” to get clout. “Why is no one talking about this??? It’s so problematic???” is another offender. But people feed those posts attention because outrage is socially profitable right now. It’s easier to get attention, likes, feedback, etc. by criticizing something rather than creating something. And so many ways people draw attention to true injustices are clearly grabs for social media attention and karma. They’re not done to help people, they’re done to feed off the negativity and draw attention to themselves. It feels like we’re creating a culture that runs off anger and spite, and IMO that’s going to cause lots of problems in the long run",

Anti-intellectualism and disdain for education and expertise is killing our culture. A significant portion of the population feels like they have the power of thought-made-manifest, that by feeling Thing hard enough it becomes a fact. Hate to break it to you, but while you're entitled to an opinion you are not entitled to your own facts. Objective truth is a thing, reality is concrete. This solipsistic madness is so corrosive, and so easy to exploit.\n\n* \"Oh, that's just how (person) is.\" Well, they're shitty. They need to maybe work on that, or expect it to come back to them. It's not an excuse for ill behavior.\n\n* Manic fandom. I get that Your Thing is very important to you, but this does not mean you are entitled to wig out and treat other people who *actually like the same thing* like they're idiots for disagreeing. The new iteration of whatever did not Ruin Your Childhood, and it very likely isn't Destroying (intellectual property/franchise creator)'s Legacy. Get off your fucking high horse, lighten up.",

I think this is rooted in wanting admiration for many. I think the intent of social media was to generate interest, but we want attention more so than to actually entertain people with informative or amusing content.\n2. \"Fighting\" for social justice in a way that gets us exposure. I don't think we fight the fight because it's rooted in real personal values. More so because it will give us a larger social circle, a sense of belonging, attention, and maybe even a job, money and other forms of personal gain. We rarely see a true hero in real life, because they're fighting behind the scenes.\n3. Politeness, courtesy, was more common when I was growing up. Callousness is commonplace now. People easily discard one another without so much as a sorry, thank you, can't make it, goodbye, nice knowing you. Politeness requires some sense of personal responsibility, to share some thought or feeling toward that other person.

She brushes it off and continues folding, but then this took to a big turn. The guy fucking touches her butt and tried to take a picture!

They have neither the time nor the inclination to respond to each and every one, if only to say \"Thanks, but pass.\"  This is totally not their fault, and I am not implying anything to the contrary.  Women owe men who message them precisely nothing, and men who don't get that are assholes.\n\nThat said... I'm not the type of guy who thinks \"Hey\" is an appropriate intro message.  When I go about writing one, I take the time to think about it, to make sure I'm putting my best foot forward, to make sure it's to the point but not overly long.  So when I go through that effort and get silence on the other end, it feels... I don't know.  Like a waste of effort?\n\nI grew up being taught that at least *some* response to someone reaching out to you, even a negative one, is polite.  Online dating discourages that, and it's no one's fault.  It's just a consequence of the format.\n\nEnd result: I gave up on the whole enterprise.\n\nTo be absolutely clear here: this is a case of diametrically opposed approaches, nothing more.  Online dating, from what I can tell, encourages a shotgun approach of sending out dozens of short messages and hoping for a response.  That works for many, but it's just not the way I think.  I suspect I'd do better in a live setting, but there's social anxiety there so that's a problem too.\n\nOr maybe my inability to adapt to this is a sign that being single is the path for me.  Frankly, I can live with that too.\n\nP.S. I really, *really* don't get dick pics.  At all.",

            "text": "Hear me out: cancel culture. \n\nI am fully and 100% okay with cancelling certain behaviours- racism, misogyny, violence, antisemitism, etc are all inexcusable. However, I see on TikTok CONSTANT videos of left wing people making fun of the stupid black and white thinking of most republicans, but then turning around and doing the exact same thing. \n\nFor example, Paige Layle. She’s a 20 year old autistic creator on tiktok, and she’s incredibly knowledgeable and well spoken especially for her age. She tried to work with other creators to set up a livestream about autism, and in the group chat, some of the BIPOC creators experienced microaggressions and felt dismissed (not by her, by other creators.) She shut down the project, released a brief video explaining why (in which she was clearly distressed and on the verge of a panic attack) and then 3 days later returned with a longer apology video, which was immediately picked apart by her supposed “supporters.” They latched onto a “lack of sincerity” in her tone, and the fact that she said “I’m sorry you felt dismissed” which apparently to them means that she’s blaming them for their feelings. Except….she’s autistic. Apologies and all their nuances are difficult enough for neurotypical people to convey at times, and can be very hard for autistic people to convey sincerely. \n\nHer comments are also full of WHITE people all parroting “now remember you can’t accept this apology if you’re WHITE bc it’s for BIPOC to accept or not if they want.” Except…plenty of POC in the comments have accepted her apology. It’s mainly white neurotypical people who are now harassing her for not conveying the exact words they want to hear in the exact way they need to hear it. \n\n\nI’m not denying that harm was done to BIPOC creators in this instance. However, I hate that we are making teenagers globally famous online and then not allowing them to learn and grow when they make mistakes. I absolutely said politically incorrect things as a teen, not out of malice but out of ignorance, and I’ve grown since. I don’t know that I would have if I had been attacked by thousands and told that no apology would suffice. People attacked her for taking 3 days to compose an apology and then attacked her for the wording she used. We can’t keep expecting 20 year olds to be role models for adults, and to not make mistakes like we all have. We can’t expect 20 year old content creators to have the poise of a 40 year old career politician with a support staff and a publicist.",

But I don’t need 200 random people I have talked to in 10 years saying happy birthday. \n\nAlso the obligatory Facebook posts for anniversaries or Mother’s Day or shit like that. Just fucking tell the person to their face how you feel. You don’t have to placate to all of Facebook. Also I find the harder people try on social media the more miserable they are in real life. \n\nPosting on dead people’s walls that you miss them or shit like that. You are probably just randomly reminding some of their loved ones about it when they could have been having a good day. \n\nNot saying when a death is suicide. I lost 4 friends to suicide in 2019. Only 1 was openly talked about and it probably saved a couple lives. \n\nAnnouncing news too soon. My brother was the 7th person to post about his child being born, he posted within 2 hours. Also, my other brother found out about my grandmothers death via my uncles Facebook post that he must have had pre-typed up bc it was long and was posted within a couple minutes of him being told. \n\n\nBig announcements from people that they are quitting Facebook. Like it’s too hard to keep up with or it’s too toxic. It’s always the crazy people who post way too much or argue with strangers all day. You don’t have to quit (for the 6 days most of them last), just go on less. Moderation dumb ass. \n\nThe extra dumb people who post things that start with “Facebook keeps taking this down, everyone share it” when most of them are just pictures of the flag or Jesus or something that would never be taken down. \n\nSharing 5 year old amber alerts and shit. Just fucking google it to see if it’s still relevant. \n\nPosting blatantly false things. Again, spend 14 seconds googling it first. \n\n\nI lost track. 😴",

I feel like this has limited actual conversation. When we just make fun of each other and refuse to even try to understand the other sides position it gets us even further away from finding a common ground or even just starting a conversation. Even while reading this we probably have those divicive thoughts running. We all need to practice actively listening to understand, and it goes all ways. We truly need to open our minds more. The world is not left and right or white and black, but I see more and more of this almost gang mentality and the notion that our \"side\" can do no wrong. Its very dangerous and if we go about thinking this way continually, imagine how easy it would be to manipulate the masses into infighting or think about how much progress is lost when we basically shove our fingers in our ears and say la la la I cant hear you you're dumb. Its scary the way we just crack jokes and proceed with minds totally made up and completely closed off towards anybody else having a different opinion than our own and us already having a predetermined unresolveable conflicts based on our views or even preceived views on certain issues, even daring to question a common narrative will get you mocked and ridiculed with no attempt and finding understanding whilst also pleading for the world to change.

Religions have origins dating back millenia. Yet people expect to overwrite and destroy these beliefs with hate and impunity in years? Instead of compassion and with time, patience and education? \n\nWhen one does, they are shunned for being a homophobe or whatever else. These are their beliefs.  Failing to respect even the worst of beliefs means that you are a hypocrite. Desiring one to respect and understand your beliefs whilst trying to shatter and break anothers own?  Because they are wrong in your opinion? \n\nAll it does is create a cycle of hate instead of one of understanding and debate. By no means I say these people are good. But by hating them and their own opinion you make yourself just as bad as they are. \n\nBoth sides have the good and bad,  the sterotypical 'feminists', the shallow people that say things to just get social rep with others. \n\nThe racists and homophones,  the transphobes.  But then we have those that were raised differently in times different.\n\nPeople hated on Prince Phillip for being racist or something. The man was born before fucking World War Two and you hold him to standards set nearly a century after his birth and raising. Shame. \n\nYou cannot change one's opinion with hate and difference. All that does is extend the cycle of hate.\n\nTake for example the fight for African American rights in America, decades ago. Both sides had reason to fear the other. Instead of understanding they hated. The Americans of British or other European origins thought them lesser and whatever they thought back then. They feared them too,  would you not fear someone who riots in the streets you live?  Who hates you because you are white and oppress them? Of course back then it was much more complicated and BAD overall. But still. \n\nSounds eerily familiar to the situation that the African Americans had too, just flipped.\n \nSome of the most peaceful people made the most impact in the fights for rights and equality. But instead of following their legacy we spit and defile their words and meanings,  intents and belief. \n\nHate and anger against a belief or opinion is not the way,  and by using it you instead turn the situation into a cycle of hate and anger,  both sides fearing and hating the other for reasons eerily the same. \n\nBy hating others simply for their opinion one lowers themself to be just as bad as they are.\n\nYet we do it anyway.",

The expectation of many is that you will check your texts, FB messenger, DMs, emails, and WhatsApp when you’re off the clock, and if you don’t respond to them in a timeframe or manner deemed acceptable by the person that reached out, you are rude and irresponsible. \nI like to be there for my friends and family, and I work very hard when I’m on the clock. Obviously if there’s an emergency, I am right there, but the expectation that you need to promptly respond to your boss, workplace, or somebody you don’t really know near immediately, regardless of the time or day of the week is terrible for your health. \nAll these modes of communication make me feel like I’m never off the clock! Like I’m being “socially irresponsible” if I’m not caught up on the coworker group-chat all the time! Exhaustive research shows that being constantly “on the clock” produces sustained cortisol levels and hormone patterns similar to being constantly chased by a bear. Sustained stress levels are not only tiring but have been shown to increase risk for cancer, heart disease, stroke, dementia, and more. \nI just got my first job as an RN (woo!), but I worked as a caregiver for years. Staffing is always short in caregiving, and I would get calls in the middle of the night, several times a week because somebody would have called off. My employers would use HEAVY guilt tactics if you couldn’t cover, and would sometimes even “punish you” with undesirable, irregular shifts if you didn’t pick up what they thought was a reasonable amount of shifts at the drop of a hat. Generally, people should be paid for the time that they are on-call, because that is time where they hormonally can’t relax, and sorry, but people physically need to relax sometimes. As caregivers, the expectation was that you would be on call, not be paid for that time, and you would make minimum wage for time you actually did spend on the clock. No wonder caregiver staffing is always short!\nThis can go in the opposite direction of course (as mentioned by some earlier) where people feel they should never be accountable for getting back to you on time or following through with plans. Those people are not worth your time, in my opinion. BUT if we’re just casually messaging over something that’s not that important, feel free to not respond for a few days! Feel free not to touch your phone for a while. You have a life! We shouldn’t be offended by people leading healthy lives away from their phone!",

I'm not married and no one says \"boyfriend\" anymore these days, so fine. I just feel like we could find/ make up a new better term without such a business feel!",

We are all within age of having children. But they are basically freaking out about teens not having sex, and it feels very wrong. I shivered typing that. I wouldn't be surprised if they do a national ad campaign soon that tries to coax teens into getting into sex. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they get so desperate as to even lower the age of consent/legal adult. We already know the gov't doesn't exactly take pedophilia seriously. It genuinely worries me what they might do to get folks to procreate more, and it's very disturbing that they are so focused on Gen Z. Again, we Millenials are plentiful and all of us are of age.

For example \"if you weren't detoxing properly, you'd be dead\" or \"that's what your liver is for\". I understand people rejecting \"detox\" fads or weird diets, but people have taken it too far and even doctors will make comments that completely reject basic sciences like nutritional biochemistry. The amount of times I've had to say \"Actually, our liver has lots of functions and can easily be at suboptimal function, that's why our liver function is reported as numbers on a scale, not as perfect or dead\"... it's getting old. I've even had to point out to other health professionals that our nutrition has a huge impact on liver function. That herbal medicines CAN exert powerful (and sometimes dangerous) effects on organs even if there are a lot of fad products out there.\n\nThere's something just a little extra infuriating about people who view themselves as passionate about \"science\" when they've never read a journal article and have never studied science and are really anti nutrition/health science... but they view themselves as knowing the truth somehow, and rising above the BS... argh it's so irritating! They treat nutrition like it's voodoo medicine, it's so strange, but as a nutritionist,  I see how trendy this attitude has become, particularly in middle aged men who dislike \"hippies\" and \"lefties\". \n\nAt least people that believe 5g towers are built for mind control aren't usually pretending to be scientific.

It’s ridiculous, and a big part of that is the time we spend in front of, or poking, a screen, while calling it “social”. Social media is anything but social. It’s antisocial, and sure, you can use it to communicate. But it definitely shouldn’t be the primary way we communicate. You lose 4 out of 5 senses in communicating on a digital device.

Now she's even expanding to hair care ( because she used to get a lot of compliments on her hair).\n\nA Youtuber that commented on TV shows/movies now has a graphic novel/book and you also have to be a patreon to see their extra content.\n\nA Fit person that used to share tips for exercise, now you have to pay to subscribe to her routines.\n\nWoman gives makeup advice and reviews, now has her own make up line, another a skincare brand or perfume and so on.\n\nIt's exhausting to see your feed full of disguised advertisement and self-promotion that wasn't their initial content and see how they use emotional manipulation to sell you overpriced things with the excuse of being a \"small business\", or casually give you a discount code so they can make money out of you one way or another. \n\nI get that's easy money and they want to capitalize it, but everyone doing the same thing is really overwhelming and the shift of tone of their content is so obvious that you notice the moment they became popular and how they lost what made them interesting in the first place.",

I’ve tried to organize apps by thumb placement so it’s easier to use, but with everything updating to this soft-blue, it’s too easy to click on the wrong thing. I know there’s probably an explanation for it, like that color is visually appealing to most people, but I’m honestly over it. I miss when apps didn’t all look like each other, and when Blockbuster was around.",

We'd make a lot more headway towards a healthy future if we could stop blaming each other's polarities and come together with an understanding of common humanity.",

I'm sick and tired of feminists claiming that \"it's not all men, but it's enough to make us afraid.\" I understand that certain men are jerks, but their behavior does not represent the behavior of all men. It's the same way that Hitler's acts did not reflect the actions of all Germans, or that Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda's actions did not reflect the actions of all Muslims. Feminists, on the other hand, believe that one man's behaviour is the responsibility/fault of all men. When a woman is raped by a man, it is the fault of the man for not assisting her; it was the fault of the man for doing nothing, even when there was no other man in sight. The patriarchy does not exist, and both men and women are capable of raping and sexually abusing others.",

I get the thrill, showing things off to your friends is nice; when i finish a set of miniatures i also run to my dad and show him because I’m proud of it; but its become so obsessive it’s insane.\n\n2. you can just claim to have just about any mental illness, most often its ADHD, OCD, Depression and anxieties. These are real and partially very horrible conditions. Youre not depressed because you didnt get over your ex two weeks after shes gone. You dont have social anxiety because youre a bit nervous around people. You dont have an OCD just because you want things to look orderly (besides, thats just one form anyways, ocd has a lot more forms). You dont have ADHD because you struggle a bit to concentrate at times. I have friends with these conditions and it’s really not nice and i can’t understand how everyone just claims to have them and everyone else just accepts it. \n\n3. the whole hustle and grinding thing. Im not playing a game just to be stressed more and try to become the worlds best player; this id exactly what i wanted to get away from by playing games in the first place. \n\n4. by far the worst and most broad is bad manors. Now i might sound like a grandpa yelling „the youth nowadays is so bad“, but there is kinda some truth in it. You see people posting pictures (staged ones too) with their beloved person dying, you see videos of people filming someone’s emotional reaction, people not helping eachother, influencers asking for free stuff, people thinking theyre entitled to stuff they clearly arent. Or even just simple things as holding someones door open and *thanking someone for it*. Those things arent hard to do at all, yet would greatly increase overall mood",

It stopped being funny when my brother one day was watching one and he was 4 at the time. The video had a series and he was watching them one at a time as they lasted around ten minutes. Around video 3 I hear the guy in the video baby talk about an among us character having a nice butt which was a 3d printed model he probably got from a forum. Video 4 was the guy talking about painting the among us character with white paint but squirting a bottle of paint onto the 3d printed among us character and rubbing it's butt with the paint while making sensual noises.\n\nSitting down later to watch the rest I realized the guy was leading up to making the 3d model wear bikinis and such for some script he made for the characters but all the while making the baby talk voice so it sounded like it was for kids all the way through. It grossed me out as this guy tagged his videos for YouTube kids and it somehow got through the shitty algorithm and onto YouTube kids app. I remember reporting it but gave up after a week.",

Can't teach your kid basic etiquette but you are soooo knowledgeable about teaching. And this shit is becoming normal. You tell a parent their kid is bullying another, they react with \"That's impossible, he would never do that\" Yeah maybe if the kid didn't feel like he has to roleplay around the people who are closest, he wouldn't unload a barrage of pent up frustration on another kid just because poor fucker happens to have glasses.

I can't get why it's better to photograph the Mona Lisa than just looking at it, burh if you have been to Paris telling your friends you saw the painting is not that unbelievable. I used to be like that until I realised it's dumb and I only take photos when I see something unbelievably cool and I don't need more than 1 good photo.

I became part of quite a few mental health support  communities, mainly because the people there weren’t paid by my mom to tell me I’m sooooooooo sick and dyyyyying. They were relative strangers, but they took my concerns seriously.\n\nI knew that I had symptoms of a few conditions at the time, and I knew that the diagnosis that I did have probably wasn’t accurate. However, I didn’t dog my doctors to diagnose me with what I thought I had. I was more concerned with the fact that I had been incorrectly diagnosed and was suffering horribly because of it.\n\nI’m still part of some of these communities, but to a lesser degree. The message has turned from self advocacy (recognizing symptoms and bringing them up with professionals) to self diagnosis. My sister is a doctor, and she gets loads of patients who just *tell* her that they have x, y, or z and need the following treatment. She isn’t here to cater to your Google search results. It is her job to examine and diagnose you, THEN try the recommended treatment. She did close to 10 years of school for her license.\n\nThis is especially common in the mental health community, specifically with personality disorders and eating disorders. It’s to the point with the latter that I *personally* know about 3-4 people who went from average-sized to unrecognizably fat, all while insisting that they have anorexia nervosa. I get that media portrayal and messages play a role; the HAES movement loves to slap an ED label on anything that resembles a diet or an effort to make your body anything but an amorphous blob. However, diagnostically, you cannot have AN unless you’re underweight. There are specific risks associated with low body weight that may not be present in EDs at large; a severely underweight patient needs more medical support than someone of normal weight.\n\nYet instead of hearing this message and seeking a real diagnosis and support, these people try seek every loophole to ensure that they, the ones who complain about having to buy two seats on a plane, have AN. They fail to realize that in so doing they turn the diagnosis into something undefinable and applied to so many people that it’s no longer taken seriously. I believe that they are paving the way to less treatment and funding for EDs all because they want their precious label.\n\n[Sorry for this being so long and having so many tangents.]",

For example, calling out a celebrity over a random user tweeting about said celebrity doing something without proof. It’s damaging to the celebrity in many ways and hard to come back from, and can damage their careers and mental state. They can lose friends, family, money, their home and even respect from random people around them. \n\nI don’t get why people love to bring toxicity online through cancel culture, but don’t do it without solid proof. If there is solid evidence about a person being an absolutely terrible person in an illegal way, then I feel it’s okay to call them out, in terms of social justice. People try to be what some scholars label as “social justice warriors”, where they play the supposed “good guy” online so they can get more clout and more views/likes online.

It's my job to go out everyday and spend 9 to 10 hours delivering packages. Someone has to do it, and it's something I enjoy doing. But what really fucking gets me is that everyday, at maybe 10% of the delivery stops I have to do, someone is outside, not wearing a mask, and approaching my van. Amazon has a policy that we're to remain 6 ft apart, masks at all time, the whole lot, and it's understandable, as I'm a high risk individual, or at least I was before I got vaccinated. Regardless of that, we're under threat that if someone is in the photo we have to take if the package, not only could we get a bad rep with Amazon, but we could lose our jobs. Additionally, I have people that try to take the package from me anyway, asking if I \"actually believe all that covid bullshit\". These people have the audacity to say that I'm a hero for \"keeping the economy sustained\" but won't even go to the length of wearing a single piece of fucking cloth over their face to communicate that they don't actually want me to die. I don't give a shit if you're vaccinated, I don't give a shit if you're wealthy or famous or whatever the fuck you are. Keep your six feet, wear a fucking mask, and let me do my job. Instead of calling your delivery driver's heroes, leave us a snack basket or some water bottles or something, something tangible to show that you're actually give a shit and that you're not just calling me a hero for clout on Facebook.\n\nTLDR people that use the word hero want to look like they're supporting frontline workers on their Facebook and Twitter feeds, without actually doing anything to support us.

I was talking to someone the other day on discord and I referred to another member of the server as 'he' but then he started getting angry, saying 'it's in my bio, call me \"they\"!!!' Scientifically, there are two sexes. Man and woman. It's just how it is. If you were born man, you are a man unless you have undergone some form of operation. Grammatically, its nonsense to refer to a single person as plural. I understand that gender is a social construct. It's different to someone's sex and there can be infinite genders.

            "text": "Out of modern trends, that piss me off the most, I pick uncovering some stuff forgotten years ago and making huge, often GIGANTIC fuss around 'em. Sometimes, these things have been mildly criticized those years ago, and are left forgotten, but reviewers uncover them, bash 'em or praise 'em, and? People become incredibly obsessed about 'em in a VERY unhealthy way (making memes, pointless reviews, with views copied from the original one, etc.)! Here's some examples for you to understand my point...\n\n- Hong Kong 97, an infamous game for Super NES (or, for simplicity sake, SNES!). Created in 1995, obscure for years, until our Saaaaaiint, preeeeeeaaaaaachaaaah, and mesiaaaaaaah Angry Video Game Nerd reviewed it. And what happened? People started making irritating memes about the game's \"story\", theme song (looped forever!), etc. Was that REALLY necessary?!\n\n- Ren Seeks Help, episode of Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon. Oh, boy...\nIn my opinion, of course, it was NOT a good episode on its own, but comparing to the other episodes of this half-baked show, it WAS quite decent. Yet the Gooooooooooooooooooooosssssssssshhhhhhhhh of cartoon community himself, TheMysteriousMrEnter, panned it, said it shows \"animal abuse\" (he meant the scenes of Ren violently injuring the insects and this poor frog. Yet people in real life are EVEN MORE cruel to insects and frogs, and NOBODY accuses them of \"animal abuse\"!), whined how it gave him mental trauma, mental illness and other bullshit like that (that's idiotic! He's a MAN, so he shoulda take it like a MAN, I mean, calmly and with a grain of salt, should he? Yet he took it like a whiny 5-year old girl!), said it is horrible, because it's scary (REALLY?! In my humble opinion, that's actually a good thing! It keeps viewer in suspense, unlike all the other five episodes of APC, consisted of dragging jokes forever!) and declared it the \"MOST HORRIBLE THING IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE!!!!!!\" (this thing is the most ridiculous in his rant. It's IMPOSSIBLE to take seriously!!! There are many other horrible stuff, that could happen to people in real life, losing a friend, family member, job, getting into addiction, corrupt politicians, unfair treating of people around the world, diseases, murderers, and many other nightmares! How the mediocre piece of media can be worse than all of that!?!). All of this is just stupid and whiny, yet it's HIS own opinion. Yet what happened?! Hordes upon hordes of people took this COMPLETELY SERIOUSLY and flooded the internet with copies of his hysteria in their rants, unfairly calling it \"the worst episode of any cartoon ever!\", while there are many, many worse cartoon episodes (and don't even bother begging me to count the examples, just think about them yourselves!) yonder! Adding salt to the wound, this episode was considered the BEST of Adult Party Cartoon. And I agree with this statement, and, in my opinion, it should be dominating around the web. But Mr. Enter's whining completely overshadowed it. This is just disgusting and sad. Thankfully, all this bandwagon is slowly, quietly dying out, yet it left some results.\n\nAlso, the second most irritating modern trend is this \"Top 10 Anime deaths/fights/moments/etc.\" copypasta, regarding cartoons created in the WESTERN world, movies, comics, literature, radio, and any other media, but NOT Anime! Are people really that stupid?!\nAlso, this entire colossal love towards Anime in the 2010's, but thankfully, we've entered 2020's, so this love is dying out.\n\nAlso, I've noiced, how many people around here mentions posting your kids' entire lives online. And that's indeed awful!\n\nWell, my friends, these trends may be annoying, but remember this: Nothing Lasts Forever. After some years, all those trends will die out, and people will come up with some new stuff. Even this COVID-19 pandemic will soon end, and everything will be back to normal (albeit not without a price). There are too many humans on this planet to be completely exinct, given all these vaccinations and common sense.\nStill, stay safe, everyone!\n\n(back to the long words \"Saint\", \"preacher\", \"messiah\" and \"Gosh\" regarding AVGN and Mr. Enter - these long words were meant to be sarcastic. I, personally, am not big fan of AVGN, he's too repeatitive, obscene, loud, and mean-spirited, yet almost everyone says this is hilarious and amazing about him. I simply disagree, because AVGN's sense of humor completely doesn't appeal to me. Speaking of Mr. Enter, I'm mostly indifferent towards him, yet how people take his words deadly seriously, like with mediocre, weak, or even pretty good episodes of SpongeBob, Chicken Little, or, as mentioned, Ren Seeks Help, and flood the internet with bias against these episodes, in favor of him, make me a lil' critical towards him. Yet, the fame of both of these gents is fading away, as the time passes.\nAlso, I'm sorry for droppin' a bomb \"bullshit\", a word I'm against using most of the time. However, as I mentioned, Mr. Enter's hysterics about how Ren Seeks Help ruined his psychic, are impossible to take seriously, at least for me, and I couldn't resist)",

            "text": "Saying this as an exotic keeper myself but, the popularity of keeping of exotic pets, specifically because of influencers on tiktok and instagram. I did my senior project on the issues of the exotic pet trade, which is just baseline problems such as the effects of importing endangered animals instead of breeding them in captivity cause it's cheaper, invasive species from people releasing pets that are too much for them, disease, and abuse that comes from people not doing their research before buying and expecting the animals to behave like domestic animals despite being 100% wild, ect.\n\nAnd tiktok and insta influencers have made this all so much worse. They don't do any research and glamorize abusive care as cute and adorable.\n\n There's an entire genre of videos of people having dozens of axolotls, a critically endangered animal that must stay in water to survive,  posed outside of water next to pearl oysters, while extremely malnourished looking.  There's people buying animals purely to flex on others that they were able to afford them. There's people handling amphibians with their bare hands(which can poison them), letting prey animals interact with animals like cats and dogs that--whether or not they ment too-- could kill them with one swipe of the paw. Keeping animals in enclosures so tiny they can barely move, and intentionally doing things to stress out animals until they display threat responses they would only naturally display if they felt their life was in danger. And don't even get me started on the people who are showing off animals that are just 100% unethical to ever own due to their social and environmental needs being unable to be met unless you have zoo like resources like primates, large wild cats, and owls. \n\n\nAnd worst of all with this trend when people critique them in the comments they are berated for doing so. Being called a tiktok vet is an insult. They treat you like you are ruining their fun no matter how lightly you comment on their care behavior, when all you may be trying to do is inform the person that their animal is severely ill. Animal abuse is not only the norm but intentional and glorified. They know better but choose to continue to keep their animals the way they are and tell others to. They parade these animals around like accessories with their videos and convince others with little to no info on keeping exotics that they should get one and to treat it the way they are is ok. It's vile. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting or keeping an exotic pet. I have two lizards after all, and I love to chat with others about their exotic pets. If you have done your research, understand how to care for an animal, have the means, time, energy, and desire to take care of that animal properly; the animal does not pose a direct threat to anyone around you or yourself, and you can obtain said animal ethically, I will not tell someone they shouldn't be an exotic keeper. (Even on that last part I will forgive because sometimes it's hard to get receipts on a breeder until it's too late)\n\nnot even everyone on tiktok showing off their animals is problematic. But they are few and far between and the way exotic keeping is being portrayed in popular culture, glamorizing abuse and putting your aesthetic over the care of the animal is horrible and needs to stop. Tiktok and instagram are easily the worst thing to happen to the exotic keeping community in the last ten years. It has set us back a long ways, has caused countless animal deaths and even more suffering, and given poachers and illegal exotic traders a lot of easy money.",
