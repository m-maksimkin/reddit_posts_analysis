I’ve only been friendly to people. Maybe a bit of a dick but times were really rough. I had no cares for anyone else because the amount of pain I was in. I was rude but never hurt anyone. And there’s so many false allegations I’m afraid to take a piss, without being accused of genocide. Who broke into my living spaces and went through doubled down, hacked my computer, the list goes on. Like the next time someone sees Shray just look him in the eyes, and think of the hours he spent doing this shit. Don’t just think oh yeah he did that. Picture him actually doing it over the course of days multiple times for months. All to blackmail me. Fucking stalker. Everyone wants to bite my head off because I outed his bicurious ass. After he asked me to join him in the shower a few times. Like no means no bitch. What is this? You can say it’s for a cult or whatever but that’s just a flimsy excuse to stalk me. Because now I’ve been known and y’all are still doing it. So basically it’s obsessing over (one boy) thinking how are we gonna get his attention? We have our top minds men, and women of all professions, working on the case. Fuck every celebrity on the planet. Did y’all lose your fucking minds? People are like oh you wanna play the victim now. What the fuck did I even do you’re judging me 100% off my private information, which you should know none of. I didn’t intentionally say anything and yet y’all draw up the most insane conclusions. I threatened to kill my roommate and prostitute my next door neighbor. WTF. But yet you convinced yourself it’s okay because it’s so fucking juicey. You started a cult and you’re like it’s okay because we’re gonna be mean to him. It reminds of elementary school when the same girl would say really mean things to me than sit next to me everyday at lunch. Like I can’t think of a more poetic analogy. \n\nNow I’m not perfect I do hard drugs, and fuck in public because I get off to other people watching. I was rude as hell to most people to quote Dave Shappel “because well fuck em”. Feels great. I didn’t know the world was watching and judging my every move. But I never hurt anyone in any regard. Everyone’s at my throat now because I’m not nice. Like I’m fucking snorting amphetamines have the confidence of a gorilla. Even when I was losing I felt like I was “WINNING”.\n\nHarmless I don’t know. You know what I resemble? The feeling of dopamine. I’m a gluttonous mf and I want to feel good. But I’m a somewhat moral person I couldn’t hurt another human being it’s not in my nature. Haven’t, won’t.",

BUT it's really easy for people to get carried away especially if they have any underlying disordered eating problems such as anorexia or orthorexia. Not only does this weigh on you heavily mentally but it can lead to various serious health consequences such as ruining your metabolism, hindering your immune system and many other problems and most severely death. Unfortunately diet culture and huge shows like The Biggest Loser promote over the top caloric restrictions and as we've seen as a consequence, the past Biggest Loser contestants have experienced severe problems with their metabolism. A lot of people go into weight loss and dieting for their health which is great but sometimes don't know when to hit the brakes when things get too extreme.",

Addiction \n\nI got off the stuff over a year ago and went through withdrawal that I personally compare to alcohol withdrawals. And I’ve been off that for about 5 years. Not exactly as bad as alcohol detox but definitely up there. For days I was completely depressed, anxious, fatigued, sick to my stomach, dizzy, anger, sadness. After that week the physical symptoms faded away and I just had the mental depression and hollow feeling. \nThen! The rain clouds disappeared and I was hit with sunshine full of natural energy and normal brain function! \nWhen you get over the hump, your body goes back to making its own energy and brain chemicals and it’s amazing.  it’s the most positive, energetic self I’ve ever been. \nI have the energy caffeine used to give me, but without the anxiety, dependence and sleep issues. \nI\nIt’s like the energy I get lasts for the perfect amount of time and then switches to a mellow energy in the afternoon. \nHaven’t felt so free from anxiety since I was a kid",

I was in a 1990 Honda with customized everything, including expensive coilovers that I had set just a half inch below stock ride height.  It didn't look lowered, and people gave me endless shit about paying for high quality coilovers that were only slightly stiffer than stock as per my request, instead of \"racecar stiff\", which is how they come by default.  It's my daily driver, not a racecar, I'd tell them.  \"Yeah but blah blah blah\".  Whatever. It's my car.\nWell, the highway straightens out, and I'm in the far left lane, doing speed limit (it was 70, so high enough).  Enter acura rsx from the right, joining me from the on ramp.  He's coming up fast, and I see his car is slammed to the ground on very stiff springs.  I can tell he's looking for a challenge, or at least to blow past me.  I'm just looking to survive the night.  He moves to come up into the land next to mine.  I see a sweeping right turn coming up.  Before he could pull up along side, I nail the gas to create some gap, and move over to the right hand lane.  He stays floored.  I slow down for the turn, and he stays in it.  His car skitters into the outside wall.  No matter how racecar your racecar is, it's useless on dead shocks.  If your car bounces like a river donut in a pool, REPLACE THEM.  They WILL cause you to lose control of the vehicle. Good video demonstration, ESC stands for Electronic Stability Control, which is a computerized system that attempts to partially/completely close the throttle to eliminate wheelspin (think \"burnout\")  and actuate the individual brakes at each wheel in order to maintain control of the vehicle and prevent an unintended spin (think \"drift\")  or the opposite, when there is low traction (think sliding in the rain), if you wanted to steer right but end up skidding forward, the right side brakes may partially engage to get the car to rotate in the intended direction.  Parents, make sure your kids have a car with ESC, it's ABS (anti lock brakes, tires do NOT stop the car faster if they are not still spinning while the car is moving) and TCS/TC (Traction Control System, which mostly just closes the throttle to prevent wheelspin/burnouts) on steroids.   https://youtu.be/5DK_Cy2vCKE\n\nHad a customer car towed into the shop.  They had just replaced the brake pads, paid a friend of their mothers uncle's best friends roommates girlfriend who happened to watch a YouTube how-to.  Said the brakes still had a bit of a grindy noise, but stopped much better.  Then, a few days later, one of the front wheels suddenly tried to tear itself off the car.  They braked gradually into the turn, then the new brake pad chewed through the last bit of disc, and poked into the fins.  Imagine riding a bicycle, then shoving a stick in the spokes.  Image : one is good, the other describes what I'm taking about.  Can you guess which is which? https://i.imgur.com/ZvBWhKl.jpg\n\nIf you have a question about your car and ANY weird noise/vibration/sensation, call local shops and find one that won't charge you for a \"brake check.\"  They'll undoubtedly give you a list of things they find wrong.  Ask them to show you what is worn out on your car.  If they refuse for any reason (\"it's policy, for safety\" etc etc) politely ask if you can take your car and go.  Tell them whatever you like, \"gotta get baby from school\"  \"I'll be back another day, don't know when\" (don't let them put you on a schedule at this time, \"I'll call you later when I can check my schedule\").  I've worked for several different shops.  Not all technicians or front counter guys are terrible, but once found at least half the workforce in the industry are absolute dicks.  I fired a technician on the spot for writing up that a car needed a full brake overhaul when the car only had 20k minutes on it and looked perfect.  No sir, I will not convey your lies, especially to line your pockets.   Anyways, if you know absolutely nothing about cars, visit a couple different shops, or see how many of your friends are REAL mechanics.  I mean, 5+ years IN A SHOP, don't let the guy who \"has a badass vehicle\" touch it.  I go to modified car meets, I'm on the Facebook groups, I've seen their vehicles and talked to them. 1 out of 10,000 \"cool car/truck guys\" know anything about automotive mechanics.  If they built their own vehicle in their garage, they might know something.\n\nBe safe, everyone!",

Like, on a summers day on a straight road you'll think you're driving on diesel ice kind of deadly.\n\nTyres don't just smoosh water away, they chemically stick to the road. That's why they get \"stickier\" when they are \"hot\". Old tyres leach out their chemicals over time and dry out. Then you've just got a hunk of rubber that doesn't stick and the tread doesn't move, so you either break off that tread or it just slides over the surface. You can have all the traction control and fancy braking electronics you like, but NONE of them work if there's no friction with the road.\n\nEven experienced car guys don't realise how bad a problem this is. And we are the worst case, because we often have a weekend/project car that sits for most of its life, then is expected to perform. Regular use is about the only thing that will help keep old tyres from being terrible.\n\nAlthough the media likes to jerk off about how ironic it is that Paul Walker died because he was going too fast, it's not true. The driver (Roger Rodas) was a racing driver who was considered \"conservative\" and Matt Farah says \"you can take that corner at 90 mph in a fucking Prius\".

In the case of baby-wearing, any impact the wearer incurs is also going to affect the child, and given how little room there is between rows of airplane seats, there's a much greater chance of injury to the baby.

I just let concerned parties deal with their stuff and go about my own work. thats the best i can do.\n\nFor those saying its obviously dangerous, I may agree with you, but a lot of people dont realize how dangerous it is. My friends used to huff duster when we were out of pot when we were teenagers and it always scared the shit out of me, but they would always say stuff like \"its not like its heroine\" or whatever, to minimize concern. they were lucky they werent this guy.

While I was naming the colouring pages they were about to get he walked up to me and bit me in the arm. Didn't think it was through, cuz no blood. But it started swelling and getting red and the marks were clearly there. Went to the doc right after my shift. He explained a human bite is the second most dangerous bite there is. Got antibiotics but they didn't work. Arm just kept swelling and getting completely dark purple over two days. Doctor sent me to the hospital where I got strong antibiotics. Basically everything in me was cleaned with that shit, felt weak for months. If it didn't start working by that night is have to come back and be hospitalised to get my underarm removed. I've shat some bricks there. Never thought a kids bite could cause this. Luckily the swelling got less and the bruise stopped spreading so I still have my arm, but that was very close.\n\nEDIT: For the people who asked me if I punished the kid, his parents did that for me. My coworker reported the incident to the parents and it was one of his last days there as they were moving (this was planned before he bit me.) His parents were really sorry and a few days later when I worked again, it was the last time I'd see him and the parents brought him towards me because they wanted him to apologize. My arm was still fairly swollen and purple at that point and he was absolutely shocked that he had been the cause of that. He apologized with tears in his eyes and actually hugged me. He promised me never to bite anyone again (apparently he had bitten his family and even other children before! So far no one had gotten an infection apart from me.) and I really think he meant that. Still had a good day with him, but was still pretty mad as I was scared my antibiotics stopped working or something but now that I think back on him he's not a bad kid, just a troubled mind that didn't get the right treatment.

It's chill af if people are only drinking a little, or if there are more fairly sober people and only a couple drunk ass people, but when it a larger group that's tieing one on it can get dangerous real fast; not enough people to look out for eachother.\n\nThis goes for rivers and lakes too. And also tripping on drugs. A group of people the same age as me as teens went for a weekend at the cabin with an acid trip. The lot of them thought taking a couple canoes out during the trip was a good idea. One of them drowned and died. Terrible :(",

This bacteria, though harmless to rats, slugs, and other small animals wasn't meant to be ingested by the human body. This is because unlike in rats, the worm's life cycle is not completed in a human. So instead of passing through the digestive tract, the worm larvae \"can get lost, and it will go to the brain, and it'll stay there,\" said Heather Stockdale Walden, an assistant professor in the Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathology at the University of Florida. The parasite is not passed from human to human. If this bacteria reaches the brain, it can cause eosinophilic meningitis  which is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The kid fell into a 420 day coma, and woke up paralyzed, unable to eat without a tube or move without intense effort. He required 24-hour care, seven days a week. \n\nTLDR: Some kid ate a slug, got paralyzed",

I'm a guy that used to ride horses in my teenage years (showjumping mostly) and would get called \"gay\" and other mean things by kids at school, because in the states horseback riding is considered something girls do, unless you're a cowboy or something. They'd make fun of the tight pants we wore for shows/competitions (all other times it was just jeans), and yet the football team's pants were even tighter, and were used to wrestle and get close to other guys which somehow wasn't considered \"gay\", whereas I was one of the few guys, let alone straight guys, that rode, and was generally surrounded by pretty girls every afternoon. I even dated a couple.\n\nAnyway, to the danger part. I knew a couple people that had broken their necks or backs during practice or competition, my foot got stepped on more than once, but once it was so bad that it left my big toe different for life. I've been bucked off too many times to count, most times landing in soft-ish dirt, but sometimes landing on pavement which got me a sprain and bruises. If you're really lucky, you'll get bucked off but your foot will stay stuck in the stirrup and then you get dragged around while the horse panics and tries to run back to the barn.\n\nOh don't forget about getting kicked by a horse just standing there. I knew a groom (person that cares for the horse in the barn) that got kicked straight in the back which left her seriously injured. Horses bite too, sometimes. Saw plenty of grooms get bitten bad. One groom even had a horrible scar across his cheek from where a horse bit his skin and ripped it. And imagine galloping on a field full speed and then the horse trips or steps in a hole in the ground. Guess where you're going? Down, for sure, but hopefully not under. There are plenty of other examples for why this sport is incredibly dangerous, and you'd think it'd be common sense, but everyone at my school seemed to think I was going for pony rides.\n\nSide note, polo is in the same ballpark and is incredibly dangerous in its own way. Go youtube videos of polo crashes and accidents. It's intense. My stepdad is over 70 and still plays, but not nearly as roughly as the pros, so it's a bit safer for him.",

When something bad happens, think about how bad it is, obviously if it’s something really big like a death of a friend or family member, then yes it’s bad, but most of depression doesn’t focus on that, it makes that 10x worse but it also makes someone calling you fat seem like someone you loved died. So when the small things happen, think about how big they really are, obviously you know it’s small, but with depression no one ever thinks about how bad something really is. When you start doing this you start to become a lot happier, trust me.",

It’s effect on the body is similar to rubbing alcohol in the sense that it has a low vapor point and tends to wet things.

Lots of people will go on walks or something where they come across a field with horses, and the next time they walk that route they'll bring apples or carrots or something to give the horses. This can be dangerous for both the person and the horse. \n\nFor people, if they can't accurately read the horse's body language, the horse may be upset and they wouldn't know it, or even if the horse was calm and behaving safely, they may mistake your fingers for treats if you hand feed them incorrectly. \n\nFor horses, a number of things could happen depending on what you give them and how much. For example, if a horse takes a big enough bite of an apple, or eats it whole, they could choke. The horse could also choke if they no longer have their teeth (and they don't generally like people checking). Horses can also have allergies to some types of treats (I know one who's allergic to molasses). Additionally, horses have very sensitive G.I. tracts. If you feed them a large enough quantity of food, like a full bag of apples, the bacteria in their digestive systems may not be able to adapt to the feed change quickly enough to properly digest the food, which can kill them.\n\nFinally, if you're on the side of a pasture, horses may come up to socialize or beg for treats if you have them. Both are potentially dangerous. Instead, show that you love the horses my staying away.",

So what happens is people hop in and are immediately ripped under and can’t get out. There are even caverns under there where some victims have been swept so their bodies can never be recovered as they never turn up down stream.\n\nTom Scott did an excellent video on it: [Video](https://youtu.be/mCSUmwP02T8)",

But high sucrose corn syrup is far more dangerous than it seems, because fast food manufacturers added it to many of their products. As a result, these foods gained a lot of \"hidden calories.\" Corn syrup is cheaper and sweeter than sugar. But in the 80s, people found that if you added much more of it to food, and disguised the flavor, consumption would go through the roof. Increased consumption of food laced with corn syrup contributed to heart disease, cancer, diabetes, strokes, and skyrocketing levels of obesity in the western world. I got this info from a documentary entitled: \"The Men Who Made Us Fat.\" \n\nOther dangers in food include some of the stuff that goes into bacon. Charred food is also a problem, as it contains carcinogens.\n\nNone of this is quite as bad as some of the charming chemicals that the Victorians kept in their kitchens. Arsenic would sit in the cupboard next to the flour and sugar. When he was a child, Winston Churchill's mother urged him to rub some heroin on his gum when he had toothache.

My best friend (we became friends at 11) and I were 21 and 22, and we were encouraged by a hayride driver at an apple farm to jump on the back of one of the connected trailers. I made it; she didn’t. She was run over by the moving trailer after I unsuccessfully tried to pull her up as she was dragged under. I was grabbing her hair, her jacket, everything. By some miracle, the ground was wet from rain and doctors later said the wheel pushed her into the (malleable) mud rather than crushed her skull. Her head was run over, though. I clearly saw this part happen and thought for about 30 minutes she was dead — worst 30 minutes ever. I had to be taken to a separate hospital in a different ambulance because they thought I might have to be committed (to a mental hospital) bc of my reaction. She doesn’t remember a thing, thankfully. We’re both 28 now and still best friends <3 I’m grateful every day that that day turned out differently than I thought, for an agonizingly long time, it would. She got scans and everything and a clean bill of health. Her ankle was sprained, though, and she was on crutches for a week.",

It most frequently occurs in grain bins and other storage facilities such as silos or grain elevators, or in grain transportation vehicles, but has also been known to occur around any large quantity of grain, even freestanding piles outdoors. Usually, unstable grain collapses suddenly, wholly or partially burying workers who may be within it. Entrapment occurs when victims are partially submerged but cannot remove themselves; engulfment occurs when they are completely buried within the grain.[1] Engulfment has a very high fatality rate.[2]",

It is dangerous for a number of reasons;\n\n1) that is a wild animal. Like all wild animals, they are unpredictable. You may decide you are done feeding them, but they feel they are not done being fed. This can easily lead to that unpredictable wild animal doing something unpredictable which could harm or kill you.\n\n2) wild animals that have been fed (particularly bears) usually end up being killed. They make the connection that people = food and they will start to stalk campers and hikers. They’re relocated but eventually find their way back. They may start attacking people when the food they seek isn’t forthcoming. The only thing that can be done at that point is to put the bear down. \n\nFeeding animals is dangerous for you AND it’s deadly for the animal. Stay in your car, take pictures through your closed window, and for the love of god DON’T FEED THE BEARS",

            "text": "Smoking weed while driving.  I often see people joke about it saying things like \"Only thing it'll make you do is go 10 under\".\n\nThe primary dangers are that due to the paranoia, you may get tunnel-vision, and not realize something that you should have.  I've experienced this, and seen it many, many times.  It's so funny how high drivers may think every car behind them might be a cop... until they get distracted by that paranoia and kill everyone in the car when they crash...\n\nAlso, it can make you fall asleep, or be more sleepy, which can reduce reaction time(not to mention it can make you fall asleep while driving, which I've personally seen... in college friend was driving on AC expressway going 35 mph, and fell asleep multiple times, and would get upset when I woke him up, or pointed out he was falling asleep while driving).\n\nThe biggest thing may be that often the people saying it's safe to drive while smoking are pot heads, or minimally experienced users.  Then novices to weed will think it will be easy for them to drive too.  The first few times(or even years) you smoke weed, it affects you very differently.  And in the beginning, you can get so very high that walking can be difficult, playing a board game can be difficult, let alone driving a car.  Weed can be VERY intoxicating to new users, and even just people with low tolerances.  Just because a guy who smokes every day of his life can drive while high semi-safely, doesn't mean you can.  The idea that weed can't mess you up as much as alcohol is complete nonsense... take it from a guy who smoked every day for 10 years.",

Dr Mike had a good analogy for this: \"if you deliver the materials for the building to the building site every month, you can keep building a house. I dump the materials for the entire year, is the house gonna get built any faster? No\". There's no such thing as a \"megadose\" of Vitamin C, you're gonna have an expensive pee and a lot of work for your kidneys. If a glass is full and you keep pouring into it, it's gonna keep running over, not magically get even fuller.\n\nVitamin C is on the more harmless side of this because it's a water soluble vitamin, much like most B vitamins. When you have too much of them, it's easier for the body to get rid of them via the kidneys.\n\nThe problems start when you overdose on fat soluble vitamins, vitamins A, D, E and K. This is the exact reason you're supposed to eat carrots with a little bit of oil or some sort of fat, it makes it easier for your body to absorb the vitamin E. However, if you have too much of any of these, the body can't just flush them out. The body doesn't really need a measure for rapidly getting rid of huge amounts of these, vitamins aren't that horribly abundant in nature as they are with supplements. An overdose of vitamin D has similar symptoms as a deficiency, only much worse. That shit fucks you up, im talking osteoporosis, kidney failure, throwing up, cramps, hypertension, psychosis. Your body can't get it out, it gets stored in your fat tissue and is painstakingly broken down and excreted via your feces.\n\nDon't fuck with supplements. Take exactly as many as recommended, not more. If you want, take a multivitamin, go ahead. But don't just combine 3 or 4 supplements, you could end up getting double or triple the recommended dose. Talk to your doctor about it. A lot of the time, *if* you do have a deficiency, diet changes go a long way and your doctor will be able to point you towards the right supplements.",

We're walking along and I hear barking behind us, next thing I know the dog come running straight past us. I turn and look and to my horror see three cows charging at full pelt heading straight for us. I grabbed my mum by the shoulders and shoved us off the path and out of their way. I remember holding onto her with my eyes shut hoping one of them didn't decide that we were the new target instead of the dog.\n\nBy the time they got to the man and dog they'd run out of momentum.

I've been looking for a new home and quite often have seen people with duplex flats who basically completely opened up the lower living / kitchen area which completely removed the protected hallway which was the only escape route.  Technically these types of modifications are illegal as well if you don't get planning permission for the works, but too many people mistake knocking down an internal wall as qualifying as the type of small work that doesn't need permission to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLoft conversions are another one, although this one is a bit better regulated since people tend to know that they need planning permission for this.  I work for a fire safety consultancy and we've had quite a few people come to us looking to get support on a loft conversion.  Almost always they're just cheapskates hoping we'll just sign off the design as safe for a few hundred but not actually make them implement any necessary fire safety additions.  But the big risk comes because once you add a floor above 4.5m from the ground you substantially increase the risk of someone getting trapped on the upper floor at a height where escaping out of the window is also not possible.  Everyone wants an extra bedroom, no one wants to have to protect their escape stair or add sprinklers...",

It's extremely difficult to overdose on those two medications alone,  but what may seem like \"enough\" in the heat of the moment may leave you hospital-ridden for life instead of dead. When I was in a dark place, working with a therapist to get rid of thoughts of overdosing, even she told me to try ANYTHING ELSE but OTC pain meds (I never tried anything else).\n\n2) Snails. People hear about cone snails more often than they hear about regular garden snails and the bacteria they carry. Snails create TONS of bacteria in order to keep themselves healthy, and almost all of it is extremely dangerous to humans. It's fine to touch snails, but do not touch anything else and wash your hands ASAP. If you have open wounds on your hands and you need to touch a snail, wear gloves and still wash your hands afterwards. Don't put snails on your face, anywhere near your mouth or your eyes, and whatever you do please do not kiss one like a real American Wipeout contestant claims to have done. Also please do not eat them raw, that can paralyze you.",

Never experienced this myself because I use a small stoneware pitcher with tiny cracks and bumps, which encourage the water to boil. Alternatively you can put a wooden stick in a smooth container to ensure the water boils. Or use a stove or an electric kettle. lol",

Oh no, I'm not here to shout about undercurrents or sharp sunken objects. I'm here to talk about the shit that gets pumped/falls/thrown in to an average river. The evening of the sheep scare I rode my bike up to my girlfriend's house, and the path runs next to the river. When I got near my destination I looked to my right out over the river and three Friesian cows were at the opposite bank. One was drinking from the river, the second one was pissing a couple of feet from the river and the piss was running in to the water, while the third bovine prick was literally shitting straight in to the river. Back legs just in the water, shitting in to the river like it was getting some kind of large scale, long term revenge. I stopped and watched it shit in to the river while the cold dawn of realization hit me full in the face; I was swimming down stream in that river just a few hours ago. My point is, you may well find a lovely spot, and the water my well look Divine, but you can't see all the way upstream and know exactly what's going in that river upstream. Just don't do it. Paddling or dangling feet is one thing, but full swimming I can no longer recommend. I wasn't sick, fortunately. Thanks fo asking.",

I lived in The Hague all my life and went to the beach quite often, but I mostly stayed on land. I've seen too many search helicopters and boats in my life and I'm only 21. Last year I saw huge searches going on twice when I went to the beach, the first time 6(!) experienced surfers went missing, and only one of them made it out alive. They were all very experienced, some of them were lifeguards even and taught classes about the dangers of the sea. The other time it turned out a 14 year old boy was playing in the sea with two friends, and he went missing. They found his body the next morning. This was just last year, when I was at the beach myself. The sea is reckless. As much as I love the beach, I don't trust the sea one bit. If I want to go for a swim I'll find a pool or a lake.",

The number of zoo animals that die from incorrect food in their systems is staggering. The average person has no idea which animals can be killed from an apple core, a piece of bread, or a grape. Even just picking leaves and grass from outside of the enclosure. A guest has no idea what an animal’s digestive system cannot tolerate and can place a death sentence on an animal just because they wanted a special interaction. \n\nLet’s talk about diseases! Our good pal rabies is a great one! Rabies vaccines are NOT produced specifically for exotic animals, so a vet will do the best they can by giving high risk animals the closest version of an appropriate rabies shot. The closest version does NOT guarantee no rabies! You tried to touch a monkey that is undoubtedly covered in saliva from grooming? Better go get your rabies shots! Not to mention the abundance of parasites and human foreign diseases that exotics can carry or we can pass on to them. \n\nTLDR: If you feed or touch a zoo animal that you weren’t supposed to, you might kill it and should probably go to the doctor.",

            "text": "Haven't seen anyone mention this one yet: lighting small campfires. Some of the most devastating forest fires, ones that resulted in deaths and widespread property damage, have been caused by some random person failing to put out a small fire they set to keep warm. Or because they though having a fire while camping or being out in the wilderness is \"fun.\" \n\nBottom line: if you start a small fire to keep warm or prepare food, **you need to put it out.** That fire is now YOUR responsibility, and thousands of acres could burn because of your negligence. Especially if you're alone in an isolated area off the beaten track, and near a lot of dry fuels, **do not leave a fire unattended.** Don't fucking do it.\n\nIf you're dead-set on marching off into the woods and lighting a fire, and there's no existing firepit or campground infrastructure, here's a list of common sense dos and don'ts:\n\n* Don't start a fire if there's a fire-restriction in effect. \n\n* Don't use liquid accelerants.\n\n* Use an existing fire ring if there is one, don't just make a new one because you can.  \n\n* Don't set a fire on a slope. Find some level ground. \n\n* If there's no existing ring, build one. Don't set a fire right on the ground. Pile up some rocks in a circle first. \n\n* This should be obvious, but don't set a fire too close to something that will immediately start burning.\n\n* Clear out a chosen spot of all debris before you burn. Don't half-ass the rock ring. \n\n* This also should be obvious, but don't start a fire that's larger than what you think you can control. \n\n* Carry some water with you or a piece of burlap you can soak with water. \n\n* Carry something you can dig with. \n\n* Try to start your fire close to a water source, so if you need to get water fast, you can.\n\n* Tend your fire for as long as it's burning. If it's still burning, someone needs to stay next to it.\n\n* It may LOOK like it's out, but before you leave it, you need to make sure. Don't leave embers behind. \n\n* When it's time to put it out for the last time, take no chances. Pour water on it. When the water stops bubbling and you can't see any smoke or steam anymore, shovel some dirt or sand on top. \n\n* Mix the ashes and embers with the soil. Stir the embers or chunks of charred wood after they're covered in water, and make sure everything is wet.\n\n* Feel the coals, embers, and any partially-burned wood with your hands. Everything, including the rock fire ring, should be cool to the touch. Feel under the rocks to make sure there are no embers underneath. \n\n* If anything still feels warm to the touch, you aren't done yet. \n\n* If it's your job to watch or stoke the fire, don't get drunk or high. Your fire can get out of control. \n\nIf this is too many things to remember, save yourself the trouble and just don't make a campfire. People are responsible for causing the majority of wildfires in the US. Don't be one of them.",

Breathing in nitrogen gas feels exactly like breathing regular air, and it is, apart from the notable part where you don't actually score any oxygen from doing it. Our body's defenses for oxygen deprivation actually have nothing to do with lack of oxygen, but rather too much co2. So when you breathe in a pure nitrogen environment you just slowly run out of oxygen and pass out. Since nitrogen is barely lighter than air, it'll just hang around. So if you see the body of someone who's passed out from nitrogen inhalation, you won't have any indication of what caused it, and you might go to try and help, only to pile on top of him. Seriously, there are multiple instances of piles of dead bodies where there have been nitrogen leaks in industrial settings. Now there's strict regulation on how drafty it needs to be around nitrogen storage, but it's still a super creepy silent killer. Just, you know, don't trust pure nitrogen.",

Things like using blankets with baby, bedsharing (no your magical titties will not save your baby from an unconscious adult or 10-20 times their size, and no you do not sleep lightly enough to always wake up because that’s not how sleep works), and putting babies to sleep in swings and rockers (including the rock and play). Alone, on my back (to start with, if they roll over and they’re not swaddled that’s ok), in a crib (or approved bassinet or pack and play). Babies who bedshare are at a 4x higher risk of dying than babies who do not. Swaddling can also be dangerous. And baby who can roll and is swaddled is at a 19x higher risk of dying.

Or any other organic solvent really.\n[And bad drug education which is cause of it, explanation below]\n\n\nYou all know that drugs are bad and addictive and can kill you. But these legal, easily available fuckers are fuckin worst.\n\n\nIf you have heroin, you can overdose it and die for few reasons: it can be contaminated with something stronger (like fentanyl), it can be stronger than usual (most drugs aren't 100 pure) or you measured your dose incorrectly. All of this things can be minimized and if you still overdose someone can revive you with naloxone, and if you didn't get brain damage you are good as new.\n\n\nBut with duster it's completely different story. You see, there is no problem with contaminants, it's not like shops dilute it to sell more duster, it's not like you can do too much of it, because really there is no way to measure dose. And it's not like it's dose sensitive, you can do less and end up worse. Do it 10 times and you're fine, and at eleventh time your heart suddenly stops and you die. And there is no antidote.\n\n\nIt's heartbreaking that it happens to kids, I've recently heard that 13 year old girl died because of fuckin deodorant sniffing. I would personally give every one of this kids a bag of weed if they want to try mind altering substance, if it stops them from abusing inhalants. I know it is bad for young people, especially with repeated use, but it's still better that children dying because one time they were curious and kinda stupid.\n\n\nFuck drug education based on premise that all drugs are equally bad, because if a child wants to try \"a drug\", what will he do? Of course thing that is in every household, not something that you have to know people who use it and thing that is rather expensive. Bad drug education built on fear is literally killing children.",

So me and my dad make pens(if any of you want to see them just pm me) and so there is a piece of metal that goes through the pen. This is called a mandrel. He was using another tool on the machine(it is a shopsmith) but he forgot to take the mandrel and so the slight wobble with a little nut at the end that keeps everything held in place. The mandrel then went into a whip and that nut acted as a hammer on his finger(which still isnt fully healed(this happened in late January)). His middle finger was broken but his pointer finger got caught some too. Luckily that wasnt broken. I can only imagine how bad it would have been if he was standing directly in front of it. TL;DR anything that is motorised and spinning can and will fuck your shit up(this applies to like half the thread lol)",

But they usually explain things in such a simple way that someone with not enough patience or grasp will tend to skip several steps or not take them serious at all.

The comments written on here are some examples.\n\nThere should be some kind of common danger avoidance manual that lists up just many or some of the most common \"hidden\" dangers that the average person will most likely encounter during/throughout their lifetime. Some of the things mentioned in this thread would belong on that list.\n\nSmall example: When I was a kid I tried to put out a tea light by pouring water over it. Shit's on fire, yo.

When I was at university we had to be prepared for work in the 'big boy' Physics labs and about 50% of the time was spent warning us how to deal with a liquid helium leak. Liquid helium is used a lot in Physics to cool things down. If it leaks out it is odorless and colourless and will suffocate you incredibly quickly. If you are walking past a lab you could see some people on the floor and want to help them. Nothing looks wrong so you walk in and suffocate due to the helium too. \n\nAnother big thing we found out is that Helium is a limited resource that will run out.

Basically, that water is moving a helluva lot faster than it looks; the walls of the canals are often very slick, making it difficult to get out; the canals will often have gates that are partially opened at the bottom, creating a delta p that'll grab you and kill you until you are dead; the canals also will sometimes have giant propellers or pumping stations to encourage the velocity of the flow (or overcome elevation problems) and have huge covered sections that you can get sucked into. It's really common for local irrigation districts to pass out literature to elementary schools warning about it.",

They “understand” the consequences but they really don’t. The number of deaths/injuries by car accident in my area is beyond astounding, and the fact that i regularly see people run red lights, go the wrong way down streets, go above 20 above the speed limit, speed in school zones, and use their phones at the same time is terrifying. People really need to pay better attention. It reminds me of a quote: “The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence” -Charles Bukowski\n\nThat quote brings me to another point: Confidence\n\nConfidence is unbelievably dangerous. I’ve seen “professionals” outright kill people/themselves with confidence. It really is frightening what a little confidence can do. Actions become less coordinated and less safe, bad decisions can be made, and lives can be harmed or ended. \n\nOther “harmless things”:\nMental health (no one takes this as seriously as they should)\nPhysical health\nLack of spatial awareness\nDiet decisions\nUsing any power tools, actually, using tools at all\nBeing late to work/absent (this one is more harmful to future career/job options if you’re younger, or if you hop jobs often)\n\nAnyways... thats my two cents, stay safe and be careful.",

Coins, too. But the worst? Batteries. Keep batteries away from children (when swallowed, the positive and negative ends of the battery can form a circuit against the esophagus or intestine and cause the tissue to dissolve).\n\nTylenol- leading cause of acute, preventable liver failure. Kills a couple hundred people a year. With significant overdose, it's a somewhat slow, inevitable, terrible death. Oh, and when a kid swallows a shitload of pills to kill themselves? It's usually the Tylenol that kills them and not the SSRI or Benzo.\n\nGrandpa's pills- Specifically blood pressure pills (beta blockers that end in \"-olol\" and calcium channel blockers) and metformin. Accidental or intentional overdoses on these are incredibly dangerous. And significant enough beta blocker overdose is nearly impossible to treat.\n\nA loose blanket, soft bedding, or child that is cosleeping in bed- Not sure how countries like Japan get away with cosleeping. Probably because their bedding is so different in the states. But every year we get a dead, floppy, blue-white baby that died after suffocating in bedding. Not to be too dramatic, but I wish I could just record what a mother learning that something so innocent killed her child sounds like. They are the most haunting, horrifying screams. I wish I could play those sounds to someone who insists unsafe sleep practices are \"okay for me\".\n\nA few inches of water and unattended infant will kill a baby. So will scald burns if over enough of the baby's body surface area.\n\nAn unlocked and loaded firearm- Probably not very dangerous to a trained individual.

People think that their cute unicorn inflatable or blow up toys are safe to leave with kids (or some adults), but when they turn around and the kid geta blown out to sea. It happens every summer and it's always the same story. Just have a search on YouTube, video of a little girl, maybe 6 year's old, being rescued a few miles from shore by a car ferry. \n\nAlso speedboats and jetskis, they pose so much danger! Anyone, any age can walk into a showroom, provided they have the funds, and buy a powerboat. No qualifications needed, no licence, nothing! It's insane! Imagine a 10 year old being able to buy and drive a 300hp convertible sports car and take their friends for a drive around at 80mph. No joke, I've confronted parents of a kid this age who was tearing up the local beach in one. \n\nOur local MRCC station, during the winter months, we hear on the radio broadcasting weather forecasts and navigational warnings, very rarely do we get Maydays or hear rescue operations (although they do happen). The first sunny day in April, silly season begins and it's all inexperienced, uneducated, oblivious beach goers or boaters. \n\nWe have  acronyms for the boaters; WAFI for wind Assisted Fucking Idiot or PAFI for Power Assisted Fucking Idiot. It wouldn't be so bad if they only put themselves in danger but other boaters that have taken the time to get educated or innocent bystanders usually fall folly of their ignorance.",

I know for sure I wouldn’t die falling off but, it was a decent ways down and depending how I fell, I’m breaking a lot of bones/not sure how far I would tumble so death wasn’t out of sight.  As I’m climbing trying to cross, this one and only time I don’t check to make sure there’s another hand hole/ledge to grab onto before taking my next step. I plant my feet forward and suddenly realize omg, I have no where to go - currently shaking typing this. I’m holding on with my finger tips and feet (mind you I’m 6’ 3” 225 pounds - far from light lol) as I’m looking behind me assessing the worst case scenario. My wife watching and the worst part, having to tell her I fucked up and that I don’t know how long I can hold on. I stand there what felt like forever deciding 1. Will I die if I fall 2. Do I try and push off and turn my body to land on my legs 3. I need to get this backpack off somehow 4. My 3 year old daughter is going to be so confused when If I don’t come home. It took me a while to really figure out what the hell I need to do. Minutes go by and I finally explain what’s happening to my wife. She panicky, rightfully so lol. But I stay calm somehow and I think that helped us both. I’m losing strength every breath I take. I manage to find a way to nudge my backpack to one side of my back, put as much pressure on one hand as I can and squeeze the rock as I let go with my other arm and slide one side off. Now I have to do it again. Tense up my body and slide it off as my bag falls a good 4 stories below me. Now I feel more free to move, I notice I think if I can somehow squat down I think I can find a hand hole to grab onto. I slowly lower my body and grab the rock ledge underneath palms facing up grabbing onto the rocks with my fingertips holding my weight leaning back trying to get lower. my arms are shaking at this point. FINALLY, I find a decent grip and climb my way to freedom. Somehow this whole time I’m able to keep calm and think somewhat rationally (other than playing the death scene in my head lol). I thank weed for this for sure.",

            "text": "Sexual bondage.\n\nPeople think it's a fairly innocuous way to spice things up, but in reality bondage can be one of the more dangerous BDSM practices, particularly rope. That's not to say don't do it, but learn about the necessary safety required first instead of jumping into it.\n\nThe biggest concern is the possibility of nerve damage, which can be quite high. Also people getting hurt when a tie becomes too tight and they try to cut it off without having the proper equipment to do so safely.\n\nIn particular, avoid handcuffs and zip ties. They're well-known for causing injury and being unsafe to restrain someone in the sorts of situations you're interested in. Stick to cuffs sold specifically for sexual bondage from a reputable place or vendor that focuses on BDSM. Not just the cheapest stuff you can find on Amazon.\n\nDon't use neckties, bungee cords, ribbons, sashes, or whatever other random objects around the house to tie someone up with or knots that you learned from sailing, rock climbing, or Scouts. The vast majority of those are not suited for what you're trying to do. A lot of rope you'll find at the hardware store is well-suited for securing a load or tying down a tarp, but doesn't have the right properties to tie up a person safely.\n\n[This is a good, brief guide to some of the basic dos and don'ts.](https://crash-restraint.com/blog/files/advice.pdf) But really, the most important thing is to realize that BDSM is complicated and potentially dangerous in ways you might not immediately realize. You can absolutely learn to do it safely and have a lot of fun with it, but don't just jump in and start experimenting. If you want to learn more, [Crash Restraint](http://crash-restraint.com) is an excellent, completely free site to learn from with lessons by a respected instructor who is well-known within the community. Other good resources are Douglas Kent's *Complete Shibari*, Lee Harrington's *Shibari You Can Use*, and for issues related to being tied safely, Evie Vane's *The Little Guide to Getting Tied Up*.",

These germs are usually spread through contaminated water, food, or objects.\n\n• Water, food, and objects become contaminated with stool in many ways:\n\n• People and animals defecate in or near water sources that people drink.\n\n• Contaminated water is used to irrigate crops.\n\n• Food preparers do not wash their hands before cooking.\n\n• People with contaminated hands touch objects, such as doorknobs, tools, or cooking utensils.\n\n2. Diarrhea: Proven ways to save lives\n\n• Vaccinate for rotavirus\n\n• Provide safe water\n\n• Adequate sanitation and human waste disposal\n\n• Promote handwashing with soap\n\n• Breastfeeding to reduce exposure to contaminated water\n\n• Treat appropriately with oral rehydration therapy and antibiotics\n\n• Train health care providers and community health workers on diarrhea treatment\n\n• Educate mothers and caretakers about caring for ill children and when to seek medical assistance\n\n• Build laboratory diagnostic capability and identify the causes of diarrhea",

I remember thinking as I was swallowing it \"oh shit, I already took one already.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 5 minutes later when I got to school, I started feeling super woozy and ran to the bathroom, proceeded to start shitting my brains out and feeling like I was gonna pass out, the crazy thing is, it DID NOT STOP. I had about 7-10 different episodes of literally shitting everything out that was inside me, and then on the 11th or 12th time blackish tar like substance started coming out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI straight up thought I was gonna die, I called my mom and told her to take me to the hospital but she though I was being dramatic.

It’s been a month and I had to come here to get her to/from appointments and today she got the all-clear. She came a hair’s breadth from losing her entire foot at 76. \n\nTurns out that she had stopped taking her vascular meds.

Obviously, me being me, I wanted to do the cliff jumping for the largest thrill, and so I did for a few minutes before we had to go, and at the last jump, I wanted to do a flip. I'd say that this cliff was only about 10-12 feet high, and I was pretty confident about doing front flips because I used to practice in a gymnastics gym a few years ago. Boy, was that a mistake. I ended up overturning and belly flopping in the cenote. As soon as I hit the water, I was paralyzed from the pain. It hurt everywhere, on my chest, legs, face, and jaw. I was okay in the end, but then I went to a different cenote in April that was about 14-17 feet tall, and holy shit, I was so fucking scared. I didn't do a flip or anything and just pencil-dived in, but that height hurt my FEET! I only did it twice before chickening out, but I can only imagine how bad it would feel if you belly flopped in.

I guess because they're classified as suppliments people think they're good for you and, therefore, harmless and - in theraputic doses as prescribed by a Doctor, they are. But even relatively mild overdoses can causes symptoms which occur within hours which include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and drowsiness.In more severe cases, symptoms can include tachypnea, low blood pressure, seizures, or coma and,  if left untreated, iron poisoning can lead to multi-organ failure resulting in permanent organ damage or death.

Just because you can by the things off any counter without restriction doesn't mean they're harmless. \n\nClinical presentation of serious toxicity from iron poisoning in the absence of treatment progresses in 5 stages: the gastrointestinal (GI) phase, latent phase, shock and metabolic acidosis phase, hepatotoxicity stage, and bowel obstruction due to scarring. \n\nThe first indication of iron poisoning occurs within the first 6 hours upon ingestion involving gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting or bloody vomiting. After the first stage, the latent phase occurs where symptoms resolve and there is an apparent improvement in the patient's condition. Following this stage, more severe symptoms may develop 6 to 72 hours post-ingestion including low blood pressure, fever, bleeding, jaundice, seizures, hypovolemic shock from fluid and blood loss. During this stage, metabolic acidosis may also develop damaging internal organs such as the brain and liver. In the fourth stage taking place 2 to 5 days after ingestion, mortality from liver failure, shock, blood loss and blood-clotting abnormalities can occur. Patient's who survive iron poisoning progress to the fifth stage 2 to 8 weeks following ingestion and experience scarring of the GI mucosal lining resulting in bowel obstruction.",

I could lift up that piece of skin and see under my skin. I put waterproof bandaid on it for a week and changed it every day. Every time i changed it i cleaned it with rubbing alcohol (according to my limited knowledge of what to do in a cut that was the most logical thing i can do to to to clean the area). After a week the wound had closed ( was still very easy to reopen the wound). So i stopped putting on band-aids during the day (I was running out of band-aids) and tried my best to get water on it. After another week it was better and it was like normal but i still was very cautious for a while. Also don’t cut off the piece of skin if it is still connected. If you couldn’t tell that was a little bit of advice if that every happens to you. But you should still go to the doctor instead of listening to random strangers on the internet.",

            "text": "Solid excuse to rant 🤷🏻‍♂️... Driving on the highway in a car takes the cake by FAR. People totally zone out and don’t pay any attention at all. Or stare at their phones. They don’t seem to realize the tractor trailer truck I’m driving less than 3 feet away from them weights 80,000 pounds when loaded going 65-70 miles an hour sometimes inches away from them. There are no fender benders with a heavy hauler truck like mine on the highway, you quit paying attention at the wrong moment and were both dead. Worst is when they merge onto the highway. wait til the last second to look for a gap or many never look at all. They just keep driving straight at 65 MPH!!! Until they end up in the right lane. They don’t seem to understand I can’t just slow down to let them in, they need to actively decide to go ahead or behind me. Not just into the side of me. \nSome might think I’m being dramatic but I drive a heavy hauler semi truck in New England, even worse in Massachusetts, mostly Boston! Some of the worst drivers in the country! I honestly feel it’s a matter of *when* a car finally hits me not *If* they hit me. I just hope there’s no casualty’s when it happens.",

Parents, as the time your child weigh 36 kilograms, DO NOT let them stand on a plastic pot no matter how high quality the pot is. It is extremely dangerous.
