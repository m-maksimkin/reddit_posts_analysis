Total chemistry was there right away and both of us were smitten!\n\nFast forward a few days later and after some lunches, dinners and sightseeing we suddenly had to fulfill our primal urges with awesome naked fun, multiple times with this lovely woman who has now become this very-very-famous female personality who just wanted a big and tall brutish-looking guy like me at that moment in time. \n\nFor over three weeks we enjoyed the local sights and it was with some reluctance we both knew we had to part ways where she went to her glamorous and wealthy life and I went back to my much-less well-heeled but much lower media-exposure position. We did not see or contact each other again afterwards.\n\nWhile acting discreet, I'm still kind of hard to miss and I was surprised that we were able to \"hide\" everything from her minders and handlers at the time where nobody ever bothered us. She wasn't really famous THEN BUT she and her parents were very well-connected and wealthy which is why security was so tight.\n\nFast-forward many years, and I am looking at some European front-page news pages and I am ASTONISHED to see in the news a now very famous mid-40's face and the faces of her now young-adult stunning-looking twin children (one male, one female).\n\nThe shock of realizing they BOTH have my eyes and facial expressions was quite disconcerting to see. It seems there was a twin realization of our dalliance so long ago and I was never informed. \n\nShe's far too famous and rich now for me to be raising a stink about it BUT I do must raise a glass in personal pride that such beautiful progeny came out of our wild times together in that royal city 5-star hotel so many years ago AND YES I would LOOOOOOVE to re-connect with our now very very famous lady! She is an incredible looker today and I can say today that her naked body would be just as beautiful NOW as it was then!  We STILL have enough time to make some more beautiful babies if she's open to it!\n\nj.j.m.",

Also, if a piece of food fell to the floor, the instruction was to put it back on the plate.

            "text": "I worked at one that used to be 5 stars. I'm talking about them being 5 stars in the late 70's early 80's. K.I.S.S. actually stayed and performed there while on tour once and they refused to let that go. The location had an on site bowling alley, 2 bars, convention center, reception hall, 27 hole golf course, 2 separate restaurants, spa, a dock on a nearby lake where they did boating, water skiing, and fishing expeditions, a private beach on the lake, and concert venue.   \n\n\nThe place changed hands several times and most of the owners were good at maintaining the property and keeping things up to date until they decided to retire. Before long the resort hotel ended up in one of those families where they wouldn't pay the taxes on the income it made and when the IRS came round they would use some loophole to transfer ownership of the resort to a family member who didn't owe anything so the IRS could chain the doors.   \n\n\nThe owners decided that the spa was to expensive to maintain and so shut it all down including both the indoor and outdoor pools, the sauna, the Jacuzzis attached to the pools, and the onsite gym. The fired all the staff and sold off the massage beds, gym equipment, poolside furniture, and other related items to make a quick buck.   \n\n\nThey got an offer on the golf course and so sold it off, firing a lot of employees in the process. The problem was that the concert venue was on the other side of the golf course and they weren't allowed to have people using the golf courses parking lot to get to the concerts so they just stopped using it and so it just sat and rotted. Again they fired all the technicians who worked it.   \n\n\nThe decided to make the convention center smaller to make it cheaper to maintain and so they remodeled and tore down around 80% of the building ironically making it to small to hold any conventions. People stopped renting the now way to small of a place and so they just locked the doors and reduced staff since it wasn't needing cleaned and maintained as much  \n\n\nThey shut down both restaurants because of cost and fired the entire staff of both locations. and started closing the bars down at 7PM most nights and would only open one if they knew there was going to be at least $100 over operating cost of opening the bar made. Guest would come out of there rooms at 9PM for a nightcap and find the bar closed and locked.   \n\n\nThe sold of the reception hall to another company that booked weddings, bar mitzvahs, and birthdays, etc, and fired the entire staff from there as well. And they sold the docks, beach, and all the associated equipment to a competing tourism company, firing the staff from there as well  \n\n\nAnd then they closed off the bowling alley to the public and guest. Due to the cost of maintaining the bowling alley they decided to fire all but one guy who was expected to do everything and only open it if a party was booked ahead of time. And the rules to book made no sense Minimum was 50 people with a booking fee of $5000 for 3-4 hours of bowling. That's $100 a person. Who's gonna pay $100 for what 2 or 3 rounds of bowling. And that only covered your shoe and lane rentals. I did NOT cover the cost of food or drinks. Meanwhile elsewhere in town you could get 3 rounds in with shoe and lane rental for $20. So yeah once they made that decision that place was basically never re-opened.   \n\n\nThe place went from a 5 star hotel with all sorts of on site amenities employing over 300 people to a roadside motel with a massive and empty parking lot employing just over 20 people.   \n\n\nThe weird thing was that they still advertised on the hotel website the spa, restaurants, bowling, bars, pools, golf course, and all the other stuff. They had to give out so many refunds when people arrived and found that the hotel didn't actually have those things anymore. This was somehow blamed on the remaining staff who they began to lay off.   \n\n\nTo replace these much needed people they would hire their friends but instead of offering the new employees actual pay the owners would give them a room to live in. Basically here's your pay minus rent for your room. After replacing nearly the entire staff the owners officially closed off an entire wing so the staff could live there. Which was illegal at the time and any time an inspection came through the employees would have to pack their belongings and leave. They would also open the bar for these people at like 1 or 2 AM so they could have loud parties, disturbing the actual guest.   \n\n\nWith the employees living on site, the lack of actual amenities, and the false advertising it wasn't long until the hotel had a bad reputation. This meant that we had to lower cost. $45 a night, cash. And eventually lowered again to $30 cash and then $25 cash. Needless to say the hotel became known as the place you go for a cheap room for prostitution, affairs, drug deals, runaways, riotous parties, drug fuel benders, the production of porn. There was even a case where a guy was caught using the cheap rooms to make child pornography with his 9 and 12 year old daughters.   \n\n\nI was eventually the only one on staff left over from the hotel's glory days and since I didn't live on site I had to actually be paid. The new owners insisted on paying me under the table. And I wouldn't leave at the end of each shift until I'd gotten my pay because I didn't trust them. So naturally in an effort to cut cost they really wanted to fire me but couldn't as none of their friends would work as the night porter. That would cut into their drinking at the bar at 2AM. Then one day one of our more loyal 2-hours-at-a-time customers asked for the hair dryer in her room be replaced as it wasn't working. I called down to house-keeping and informed them of the request and room number and they said they'd get on it. Instead they sat in the breakroom smoking pot. The customer complained and I was terminated. I got a part time job moving furniture a few days later.  \n\n\nLess than a week later the owners told all the employees that an inspection was coming so they packed up and left. The inspection found bed bugs and so the owners responded by packing anything of value into a moving truck, putting chains on the door, and turning off the power. Apparently it was cheaper and easier to shut down then it was to fumigate. Everyone left working there suddenly found themselves jobless and homeless. And then it came out that the owners had embezzled over 10 million dollars from the hotel and that's why suddenly everything was too expensive to maintain and needed sold off. Money they also pocketed.",

            "text": "*I'm bored, so here we go*\n\nI worked at a high end resort hotel in Arizona when I was 21-23 years of age. I was a concierge. Base rate room was about $600 a night but the suites could easily run you $1000+ a night. Considering this was 17 years ago, you can imagine how much pricier that was then. If it was the off-season (the summer of Arizona), you could probably get a room for $200 a night as we were at like 10% occupancy max, but then from late January to May we'd be at near 100% capacity 24/7.\n\nWe catered to famous people, sports stars, and overall fairly wealthy people who you would have never heard of but they make some of these \"famous\" people look poor.\n\nFor example, we had a guy that that literally was worth hundreds of millions, was retired, and would come and basically vacation for 1-2 months at a time with his wife. He had his own parking spot at the front door so he didn't need to be valet and drove some 1 million+ sports car in the evening (which is why the hotel liked it parked out front), but had some other super pricey Bentley they'd drive when their grand kids would visit. They would disappear for a week... room still paid for and not think twice about it. They were not alone.\n\nHere is a few things I learned the management does not want people to know. People die in hotels:\n\n* The reality is that a lot of the customers with this kind of money to burn were older and often retired. Sometimes these people just die in their sleep. Every other month there was a death in the hotel. Not a murder, a medical emergency death. The hotel was extremely discreet about the rooms that it happened in and made sure to scrub their computers of any of that data so employees couldn't even share it amongst themselves.\n\n* There were cameras literally everywhere and we had a full security team that isn't just recording all the feeds, but actively monitoring every single feed, including every elevator. We had motion sensors built into the cameras and they would flash a light at the monitor indicating movement at that camera. There were nature trails around the desert on the outskirts of the hotel grounds and there were cameras out there. About the only place there weren't cameras was the inside of your room. Lots and lots of people get caught getting down and dirty literally everywhere. I remember when I was a fairly new employee and I didn't know this I used to take elevator rides with a coworker I was fooling around with and we'd get a little frisky between floors. Not too crazy, but I'm sure the security guys laughed at their daily grind show. I ONLY found out when a \"loss prevention\" dude was like \"Hey, check out our command center\" and he showed me all the cameras. It was like he wanted me to figure it out on my own lol. At least they were cool about it. Also to note, hotel workers hooked up a lot and knew about pretty much all of the dead camera spots. I remember at the concierge it was me and 3 other girls, It was basically a rotating shift of 2 people always, 3 people on a busy day. I had fooled around with all 3 of them at some point, they all knew about it, and no one cared because it was pretty much just fooling around out of boredom and relative attraction, but no one ever seemed to get clingy in any department. Seriously, I can't think of a single \"couple\" in the entire hotel work force. Lots of hooking up, no relationships. Lots of cheating on their partners who didn't work there too, sadly, but very common.\n\n*Side note, funny enough, the ONLY super clean cut person I can think of that wasn't like this was our General Manager who was apparently Mormon, and he was from the Philippines, and he was a huge family guy. Honestly, I really liked him a lot.*\n\n* Lots of the women that hang out at the bars at the hotel, particularly the one by the main outdoor patio are regulars trying to score a wealthy target. I pretty much recognized all of them, varied in age range from 20s to 50s. They were local women. Some would have memberships at the golf club which was several thousands a year, like 12k a year back then I think, but the local golfers basically all knew them so they would shift to the resort bars with the new faces. No joke, several of them were straight-up hot 10/10 chicks and they would almost always be there during baseball spring training season because you'd just sit in the lobby and bump into players. Management was ok with this because they were attractive. Seriously, if you were ugly and trying to become a regular, management would tell you that if you weren't a guest or visiting with someone, they shouldn't be there unless they were dining in the restaurant. It was really just a subtle way to push them out. They'd look the other way for attractive women. It wasn't a guy thing either, it was an aesthetics thing. Our front desk manager and main restaurant manager were both women, as was my concierge manager.\n\n* Hotel workers hooked up with customers more than you would think. The cocktail waitresses were actually kind of famous in our hotel for working the live music weekend shift til 11pm, yet for some reason you'd see them pulling out of the parking lot in the morning as you came in to work lol. Of note, employees were not at all allowed to hang out on hotel premises unless it was your day off and you were dining in one of the restaurants only.\n\n* No one was impressed by your wealth because people were desensitized to it.\n\n* Pay was mostly crap for hotel workers. The only people that make any money in it are the lifers trying to make a career in hotel management. They all start at the front desk and work their way up.\n\n* Seasonal work was done by cheap labor flown in from the Philippines for peak capacity times. They all lived in paid housing at apartments off site. They rarely interacted with your local American employees and were basically just the help. There was a serious issue here with hiring local people, however, as you go from 100% capacity for 4 months down to 10% capacity for the next 3 months or so, you can't keep 700 employees on staff no matter what prices you are charging. These people were mostly kept behind the scenes. It kind of felt weird to me when I worked there, but it wasn't all bad. Our general manager was actually a native dude from the Philippines that had worked his way to being a top professional and businessman and was quite fluent in English. The language issue was actually a serious barrier for much of the low wage help.\n\n* I saw someone mentioned prostitution but I honestly didn't see much of that at all, as you can probably kind of tell or start to recognize repeat faces. We were trained to look for sex trafficking victims, however. The whole time I was there there was never a single case reported. My guess is they probably don't go to as pricey hotels.\n\n* Drugs are found all of the time from cleaning the rooms. It was never reported, just \"thrown\" away if the customer had already checked out. Or, if the guest was still a resident, they were instructed to leave it where they found it and to skip cleaning the room, but not to do anything about it. Customers would leave drugs all the time out on the table for all to see.\n\n* Employees hated teachers. I hate saying this because I love and respect teachers, but at least at our hotel the WORST conference a year we all had to look forward to was the teacher's conferences that would come from these California school districts paying absurd amounts of taxpayer money to hold it at a luxury resort in Arizona. I don't know what it is, but many of the teachers would get absolutely power trippy on the employees, demand absurd things, or would just be outright mean, like they were trying to overcompensate and show that they belonged by being assertive, not realizing that the most wealthy people usually don't feel the need to prove anything. About the only group despised more than the teachers were the female celebrities. There were a couple of ones that were super friendly and, but apparently the whole thing about movie star celebrities having an entourage of people around them is real, and some of them are straight up DIVAs with crazy requests, including demands for things like no employee is allowed to look at them. I wish I was joking. For some reason I never met a male celebrity that was a total dick. They were actually pretty chill, for the most part. Definitely not high-demand divas. Well, there is one exception actually, now that I think about it. A comedian/former tv star was kind of a dick. I probably won't name names here. Baseball players, sports guys were almost always pretty chill. Baseball player wives were often also pretty chill, but also often crazy Divas themselves. I did meet Tiger Woods and his \"ex\" wife back then and let me tell you, amazing dude. His wife then was like 11/10 hot scale in person and absolutely one of the friendliest \"famous\" guests we had. PGA tour in February you'd get the golf pros. \n\n*On a final side note, as a guy, I always thought it was weird how many women basically live vicariously through their husbands. What I mean by that is here I am as a concierge, giving advice on restaurants and making reservations and so on, and a woman will come up with a girlfriend or something and it will be like \"Do you know a good Italian restaurant around here? *My surgeon husband* loves Italian food.\" Like somehow I needed that information to make your reservation at the restaurant or book your mountain biking.*\n\nAnyway, nothing really dark and seedy and secret goes on behind the scenes, honestly, aside from the fact that people are getting royally ripped off lol. The profit margins in these hotels are INSANE. I suspect some hotels might have different cultures, of course.",

I didn't care how I worded the statement or how any pages I used. I included past employees who were fired because they refused to put themselves in danger. They opened cases too. I got the amount of my contract and some more. They ended up selling and now it really nice and decorated to honor our city.",

We had a regular lady that would come in rent a room and park her car for the day.

I‚Äôm not sure if management ever actually knew what they were up too as my hotel had more then one. \n\n2) deaths - Every hotel has stories of people found dead in rooms. In my time we had two OD‚Äôs. But the staff who had been there for years would tell stories of others. Multiple suicides (also if your going to blow your head off, have the fucking courtesy to not do it in a hotel room so a poor old housekeeper who makes 12.00 an hour has to find your body) and OD‚Äôs. One story stuck out in particular, a guy accidentally hung himself while masterbating with a belt around his neck tied to a wall mounted lamp, and the staff was just surprised that the wall lamp was mounted well enough for a guy to hang himself.\n\n3) you fucking monsters - not all of you. But some of you are literally fucking animals. Wiping your ass on the curtains, shitting under the mattress, wiping your dick and balls on EVERYTHING. Cum...cum on everything.

Saw so much shit happening and had to deal with it. Some highlights:\n\n* Did lead out some escorts/girlfriends/groupies through the service tunnels to their cabs wating at the back, while simultaneously a colleague was stalling VIP/famous guest's wife in the lobby and housekeeping quickly cleaned or swapped rooms so wifey doesn't see any evidence of the orgy happening 5 minutes earlier. Happened several times. Pro footballers were the worst with that. But the tip was always very good...\n* Had a group of Japanese business man asking me to get them a Japanese escort girl at like midnight. A bit late + Japanese girls are super rare in that area. Need normally 1-2 days ahead time for calling around and stuff when the demands are that exotic. When trying to convince them to go for smth else they revealed that they wanted a Japanese girl because they were afraid a European escort wouldn't be satisfied by their small Japanese dicks or smth like that. Lovely guys.\n* Generally lots of prostitution/sugar daddying happening. You see every evening old fat business guys sitting at the bar with younger women, some even teenagers. And some escorts were returning guests, so you could see them several evenings per week with different guys. And we totally get that you are a sex worker when you are a young attractive women entering the hotel around 8-10pm and leaving it 2-3 hours later with wet hair. Not that we care, but it is part of the job to low key know what the fuck is going on in your hotel. Would guess that 15-30% of rooms are rented out to sex-related stuff every night.\n* Hosted a marriage between 2 hostile Arab clans. They were filthy rich and had smth like a hundred years old blood feud. Apparently 2 of their kids happened to fell in love with each other and now hundreds of clan related guests that hated each other were in the hotel. The Lady owning the hotel thought is was super romantic \"Like Romeo and Juliet!\", but I had to deal with one Arab Grandpa pulling out the ancient family sword to avenge his ancestor who got fucked over in the 19th century by the other clan. At least this is what I understood in all that mess. Called the police out of desperation and fear, but the Arabs bribed their way out and management did some damage control.\n* When I did my routine check up around the facility late at night I registered that someone was in the bar, which was supposed to be closed that late. Apparently some guys broke the lock of the fridge with the expensive champagne and popped some bottles. Cheapest bottle was like 150‚Ç¨. Approached them and asked what the fuck they are doing, but the guys were intimidatingly HUGE animals and one of them had his shirt open so that his prison tattoos were revealed. Real mobster shit, like these kind of tattoos showing orthodox churches and every steeple is some code for a major crime he did. There were a lot of steeples. Noped the fuck out and figured out their room. Counted the empty bottles next morning and billed it on their credit card. Was smth like 20-30k‚Ç¨.\n* I finally quit when a junkie tried stealling the 50k‚Ç¨ daily revenue I had in my cash register. He threatend me with with a needle, but I mangaged to lead and lock him up in one of the back offices until police arrived. Did it so smoothly that none of the guests noticed.

There was a lot of damage done to the rooms by very entitled rich and famous people but it was a beautiful hotel and still is. Stunning. There was a lot of sex parties though. A lot of cocaine, pills and sex. \n\nI have a cool celebrity story.\nOutkast stayed there for two days, andre 3000 and big boi.\n\nI‚Äôd met a lot of famous people but none were as kind as them, absolutely none. As a young woman at the time, I dealt with a lot of inappropriate things in that hotel which included famous men and women propositioning me. I had more women proposition me for sex than men oddly. And some were celebrities and socialites, others were just super rich or girlfriends of athletes or artists. \n\nOn the first night Outkast were there with a team (rented 8 deluxe rooms for their team and whoever else), a couple of women were harassing me in an elevator because I wouldn‚Äôt give them the room number for either party. I got spat on and shoved in there. I was really shaken up and cried hysterically when I got down to the lobby. Low and behold, Andre was down there talking to some fans very nicely. He just had came back in from exploring the city around 2am. He went searching for a vegan spot (he was ahead of the curve). \n\nHe saw me crying and came over to where I was standing to ask if I was okay, firstly I couldn‚Äôt even make words out because I love Outkast and I felt humiliated. He sat down with me and the same women harassing me in the elevator from the 12th floor to the lobby just observed and called to him for his attention. \n‚ÄúWhy are you with that ugly cheap bitch (referencing me), she‚Äôs a rude desperate bitch. Wouldn‚Äôt let us come find you!‚Äù \n\nHe had a look of disgust on his face and just told them that I was his close friend from Atlanta. The funny thing is that I am from Atlanta and earlier in the day we checked them in, I told them how much they meant to me as a girl from Atlanta. He actually ended up speaking with me most of the night in the lobby and we went on the rooftop after I got cleaned up. My manager was very cool and handled everything. She had gotten those girls escorted off the premises which was a relatively painless thing. Within the hour, thanks to his complaint (Andre) they were gone. \n\nAfter I got cleaned up and they left, we just hung out most of the night. I was still on shift but my manager was just so understanding. We must have spoke until 7am. \n\nI never forget them. Andre gave me 5 free tickets to a sold out show they were doing the next night. I brought my friends with me. Have us backstage treatment and a ride there. Hung out in his bus after and hung with big boi too. They had separate tour buses and andres didn‚Äôt have any liquor or drugs. He was vegan and holistic at that time. He had his chef make us a chickpea salad and it was one of the best moments of my life. I‚Äôm probably the only person  with a photo album they keep up with now, but I look at the pics I got developed from that night. There‚Äôs a picture of Andre and I hugging and making a stupid face. I look at it sometimes because I remember how happy that experience made me. I was supposed to work that night but my manager gave me a free pass for the weekend lol. She stepped in for me. \n\nFunnily enough, years later I was in Ireland for a friends wedding and him and I stayed at the same hotel. He was shooting the Jimi Hendrix movie. We were on the elevator together because we stayed on the same floor. He actually said hello and we got to talking, he just said I looked familiar to him. And I told him we met years ago. It was a come to Jesus moment in my life lol. We hugged for so long. This was maybe 2012. \n\nSaw him again by chance in Philly in 2019 (where I now live). Took a picture and this time swapped numbers! I never text him but I‚Äôm so glad this came out of the hell of working in a hotel 20 years ago.

Eventually, low wages equalled an extremely low skilled workforce, and nowhere was that more evident than in our security department. While some of them were ex-military and some of the funnest people I ever had the pleasure of working with, the newer ones fancied themselves as future PD material, and one of the perps they were most on the lookout for were the human scum who would dare to solicit a prostitute while staying in our prestigious, virgin establishment. Cut to a normal Friday night when we had in-house a large group of conference attendees, all of whom seemed to retire to their rooms fairly early compared to most conventions, but then again, this being a conference of elderly evangelicals, it was not surprising. In the still of their ruliness, one intrepid security guard named Brad (actual name) spotted a lone white female entering the room of one of our guest attendees during the overnight hours. Brad, going by natural instinct instead of consulting with front desk staff, went straight to that room and knocked on the door with the might of a warrior. When the perplexed male guest appeared at the door, Brad asked to speak to him in the hallway, and in a pointed yet whispery drawl, asked, \"Sir, is that a, uh, prostitute that went into your room.\" The guest, with astonishment and not even a hint of anger simply said, \"That would be my wife, her flight just arrived.\" And that is how we managed to have our first ever all-employee meeting.",

            "text": "I wrote travel guides to places in the Middle East (Dubai, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, etc) and have stayed in lots of five star hotels around the world for work. \n\nTHe whole five-star system is murky from the start.\n\nThe manager at a top-class London hotel told me that the hotel grading system in general is ‚Äúutter nonsense‚Äù. The problem, he said, is that the list of criteria to reach each of the star ratings is little more than a tick sheet, albeit with around 500 factors to consider. For example, one criterion for being considered five-star is fresh flowers being present in guest rooms, but there‚Äôs a huge difference between a big ornate display of orchids and a bunch of daffodils. The presence of either would technically tick the box and in theory you could fulfill all the required five-star criteria yet be hugely inferior to the hotel next door that offers all the same things but at a much higher quality and standard.\n\nThe Forbes Travel Guide gave just six London hotels a five-star rating (including the one my insider works at) but that means that fantastic hotels like The Ritz, The Langham, The Berkeley, and Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park are ‚Äúonly‚Äù four star. Are they really 20 percent inferior to the five-star-rated Al Bustan Rotana in Garhoud in Dubai which is basically a business hotel near the airport?\n\nIt‚Äôs also difficult to maintain a consistent roll-call of criteria, as modern demands change. For example, Wi-Fi in the room is a relatively recent expectation and what we expect as standard has changed over the years, so what constitutes luxury now has altered accordingly. When Savoy Hotel in London opened 1889 it was boasting about features such as electric lifts, ‚Äúspeaking tubes‚Äù to link each floor, and fully plumbed bathrooms.\n\nNow though, in the era of Internet, crowd sourcing is often the most reliable way to judge somewhere. When hundreds of people on sites like TripAdvisor say a place is overpriced and terrible then it doesn‚Äôt matter what the official book says. And if a one-star hotel gets nothing but praise from 90 percent of the people commenting? There‚Äôs your consensus of rating right there.",

The hotel I worked at for a year had a strict privacy policy around this and you are told, well it's drilled into you, \"not our business\".\n\nUnsure what it's like these days but my entry level job in the travel booking world started as a travel planner for a 5 star chain in Melbourne Australia a couple of decades ago. My station was next to reception (I looked like I was a part of reception, but was on the end) and it was not uncommon to have the affair couple check in then, while the affair partner was still checked in, the cheating spouse would return the following day with spouse (sometimes spouse and kids) and check into another hotel room. We were under strict instructions \"not our business\". But it wasn't uncommon on holidays for both spouse and affair partner to be in the same hotel at the same time.\n\nWasn't uncommon to see married people use the day stay program to cheat, sometimes with the same person (affair partner) but on occasion someone new (it's not below me to say I took some joy in knowing the cheater was being cheated on.)\n\nHowever there is that \"one\" that will be seared on my brain forevermore. A married couple,  both had rings on so I just assumed husband and wife, were regulars at the hotel for weekend stays, nice chatty folk (I was young so I didn't get many people stop and chat with me), I booked them on some day trips, sunset dinner cruises etc mostly couple/romance geared packages and since ID wasn't required for both to make the bookings they never corrected me when I booked the itineraries in both names but with his surname (since he paid with his card, I had his full name.) So cut to a few months later, this married man checks in but with a different woman, *sigh*, I will forever feel like a monster when that woman \"snuck\" downstairs to book herself and her husband the exact same romantic sunset cruise package that that man had booked with this other lady only a fortnight ago, to celebrate the end of her chemo round. She wouldn't stop talking about how this getaway was her thankyou gift to her husband who has been so amazing and supportive during this time. ... typing it I still feel like the worst human that I choose my job (breach of privacy is instant dismissal) over telling her what was going on. And yes that other woman (the woman who was having the affair with the married man whose wife was battling cancer) did turn up with her own husband and booked a dinner cruise and her last name on her ID was not the last name I had been using previously so that sealed it that they were having an affair together. \n\nThe other thing is drugs, cocaine mostly. Had a semi famous couple have their wedding reception and most guests were high, best man passed out in the bathroom, shat himself, with the straw still up his nose. Maid of honor pissed herself while sitting at the bridal table. \n\nThe cleaners see the worst of it, I just worked up near reception and saw some bad things but no doubt the cleaners would have seen the worst of what hotels don't want the public to know about.",

It‚Äôs not the hotels fault, we noticed international travelers tend to bring them. Probably because they‚Äôre staying at multiple hotels per trip. You can even get them from the airplane. To check for bedbugs just inspect each layer of the sheets, under the pillows and mattress. They look like tiny roaches. If you see blood spots on the sheets the next morning that‚Äôs usually a sign you have been bitten, but the bites can sometimes take a few days to show or get noticed. \n-\tChecking in late at night sometimes means free upgrades or discounted upgrade rates. We would try to sell every last suite at night for almost 80% off. We just wanted something, so they don‚Äôt go unoccupied. Sometime if we were over sold on rooms, the late late arrivals (midnight) would get a free suite upgrade because we had no choice. Of course this could also backfire if the hotel is sold out.

I still remember her name was Katrina üòÇ\n\n\nSomething else interesting - one of the (5 star) restaurants I worked at (in a 5 star hotel) would frequently be closed for private events. There was usually a contract written beforehand stating the group must spend a minimum amount of money.  We got automatic gratuity on whatever that minimum was but the goal was to go over so we would make more money.  The people at the events usually didn‚Äôt know these details (they weren‚Äôt the ones paying) and towards the end of the night if they hadn‚Äôt reached the minimum we would have to start pouring the most expensive wine and liquors to meet the goal.  Who wants a few rounds of McAllen 25 doubles etc.  And people still tipped cash on the open bars so it was easy to walk away with $500 a night in tips after those parties.

For an example, there is a hotel in London has a marble check in desk that cost about ¬£23000 alone but the rooms are decorated with pretty cheap stuff, they had a handful of qualified tradesmen with the rest being made up by an army of people from Pakistan in the UK on a student Visa and they were getting paid about ¬£5 an hour cash in hand. In many cases fancy looking things are bought cheap, my company went to a cash and carry and bought really cheap tie-backs for the curtains that were really bling and bright looking, it didn't matter as the folks staying in the hotel would have been wealthy and would never go to a cash and carry so they wouldn't really know they were cheap.",

Management gave us 23 minutes to finish a room no matter how disgusting it got or how many beds it had so chances were high the floor hadn‚Äôt been vacuumed and the larger pieces of debris were just picked up by hand to save time. Also we used to have to wipe down the bathroom sink then fill that up with water to clean all the glasses in the rooms at one point which was just gross. Those nice white sheets are guaranteed to have had blood on them many times, especially if it was old people staying in the room. They just seem to open old cuts very easily and leave blood spots all over the sheets.\n\nThe hotel was also too stingy to buy new king bed covers and there was never enough for all the beds we had so their solution was to fold two sheets over the doona instead which is pathetic for a ‚Äòfour star‚Äô hotel.

We want to eyeball the situation just to be safe.  99% of the time is just a group from multiple rooms has congregated in one room.  The 1Ÿ™ is a single or couple drinking very heavily. I went up to this one room and when they opened the door I could immediately smell the shit, vomit and wine. I told them I was the manager and did a room inspection. Just as I thought there was shit, vomit and wine everywhere. This couple were out of their minds drunk and high and essentially after talking with them out appeared they were trying to kill themselves with booze and pills. We got them out of the hotel with a refund. It took about 4 hours to get them out. \n\nAbout 8 months later one of the bartenders came to me and asked if I recognized a guest. She enough it was the lady from that trip.  I walked up to the lady and said welcome back to the hotel and that she was welcome to stay but no alcohol could be in their room nor could the buy or consume alcohol on the property.  She didn't like that idea so I got to kick her out for a second time.  I went to the front desk to let the new front desk manager know what I was doing.  She wasn't at the hotel when the first incident happened and she thought I was crazy for refunding 4 nights at $475 each night without cause. I asked her to trust me for a few minutes.  The manager came with me because I needed a witness to go into a guest's room to kick them out. On the way up the elevator the guest decides that I'm cool and the front desk manager is the enemy. I laughed my ass off and the front desk manager was asking what she did since it was clear that I was the one kicking her out.",

I could literally write a thousand lines of information regarding behind the scenes drama and bullshit, some that probably doesn't affect the guest so much as it does make the employee's lives a living hell. So for brevity's sake: Just because that sign outside says \"Hilton\", it doesn't mean that it is actually owned or operated by Hilton. In fact, the local \"management and development company\" that owns my place of work also owns a lot of hotels that you would rightly assume to be \"direct competition\", but noooope. This is an illusion of choice for the guest, where as they may have a bad experience at this one particular Hilton property and wish to go stay at the Hyatt down the street, completely oblivious to the fact that the same idiots in charge of the place they just swore up and down never to return to, will be the same assholes pocketing your protest money. I'm not saying every Hilton hotel is like this as some of the more notable locations truly are owned and operated in house, but a lot of them are just as I described. My employer actually owns several Hiltons, Hamptons, Hyatts, Marriotts, etc. you name it.  \n\n Also don't assume the suicidal looking individual behind the desk should cheer up as they are obviously getting paid the big bucks working at an illustrious Hilton hotel of all places!; if they're like me, they could actually be working for another (and more awful) company. One with employees who are criminally underpaid, overworked, undervalued, etc. I've seen my hotel rake in well over 15k in a single night yet any wage above the minimum for employees of several years is \"beyond the budget\". Housekeeping in particular also deals with some awful shit and truly are by far the most unfairly paid. Also a relatively new one: Since COVID began our inspections have been done remotely. How can that be done remotely you ask? The inspector will have a Zoom call between themselves and hotel management. The inspector will instruct this management team to point the cameras in whatever device they are using towards different points in a room. As you can imagine, this is easily bullshitted. Also, inspections in general are very seldom done. 2 times a year in most cases with the inspection of around 5-7 rooms total on a busy trip. It also takes a LOT to lose your \"flag\" (aka the privilege of calling yourself *insert brand here*.) I've seen us float between \"unacceptable\" and \"failure\" for extended periods of time and alas we still got our flag.  \n\nOh here's a good one: Review your stay. Not just through the company directly but also on Yelp, Travelocity, Tripadvisor etc. Hotel management really don't like negative reviews on third party sites lmao. If a specific place's MGMT don't seem too interested in hearing your bad experience I promise someone higher up will go into panic mode and do whatever it takes to save face once your bad experience becomes very public. Through Hilton in particular, they take \"SALT scores\" very seriously and it is even included in the scoring of those inspections I mentioned earlier.  \n\nI could go on for hours but I will just leave this comment with: Don't be too hard on general employees like housekeepers and the front desk employees, night auditors etc. for things beyond their own control. Sure, some employees can be awful or rude and feel free to mention them in a review or to MGMT but some of us really do care how your stay is going and are empathetic to your needs through whatever undesirable situation is unfolding. And despite working here, I couldn't afford to stay here for even a single night if I wanted to so yes I really do agree that the room rate is quite often \"bullshit\". And there's nothing more embarrassing than checking someone into a room that is listed as Vacant/Ready in system but actually dirty/occupied (you'd be surprised how often this can happen). Well, there is a lot more but I'll save that for another day. Ohhh and if it seems like the room rate went up an extra few hundred dollars because there's a Holiday, it probably did.",

There was no food or laundry facilities, but the company kept up the salary deductions to cover food and laundry, we were supposed to cover it from petty cash that my boss had. Well, was supposed to have, but the bank wasn't open.\n\nOnce the season started and the guests arrived, the complaints came in. \n\n* the food that was there was a buffet, and the options were super weird. We got a tray of bacon as the meat option one time, and baked tinned potatos as the side pretty often. and then the vegetarian options would be like, hot olives.\n* the hotel was dirty - the pool had stuff growing in it because no one in a ski resort owns a pool cleaner. So they just turned the heating off to kill the algae/moss. In the snow. cold-ass pool. the kids hated it. \n* the cleaners didn't clean all the rooms on changeover day. One family arrived late - 8pm after a delayed flight and when they went to put their kids to bed, there was a banana skin on the table left from the people who left that morning before 9am. Oh, and because they arrived at 8, the kitchen wouldn't let them in to get food - last entry at 8pm even though there were still people in the buffet area and still food laid out.\n* food hygiene was really bad. kitchen was gross. buffet left out for hours. many MANY guests got norovirus, to the point that it was a frequent complaint in the reviews of the hotel. I got norovirus after a kid puked on me, who knows where he got it? I do. The Hotel. anyway.\n* turns out they had problems with noro the year before too! so many people got sick that the company was sued, and thats why the new management took over.\n* we were supposed to clean the 'childcare' sections every day, but we didn't get given cleaning products, so it was just soap and water and baby-safe detergent that smelled like ass. Also we couldn't leave til it was done so it was done as fast as humanly possible before we all fucked off home. \n\nThis was all made worse byt he language barrier. The staff all spoke french - which is fair enough. We were in france. The english staff did not, there were a handful of us who did but no more than school level mostly. The english boss, in charge of the resort, didn't speak french. He only spoke spanish, which was handy for taking to the kitchen guys, because they didn't speak french either - arabic and spanish mostly. This meant there was a huge disconnect between the local staff, who ran the hotel, and the english workers, who mostly did childcare and 'guest services' ie hearing complaints. \n\nLots of the problems came down to laziness and/or apathy. Every worker there was getting paid very little to do a crappy job, english AND local. So it shouldn't have been surprising that they didn't take pride in it, we all just wanted to ski and drink. Work suffered because no one cared. \n\nAnyway I left early but not as early as I should have, then covid hit and everyone else lost their jobs too. Including the boss, who had the same almost-illegal work practices forced on him but had no one to complain to. I didn't feel too bad for him on account of he fucked two of the english workers who worked under him, which is literally always sus. \n\nFucking mess. Put me off hotels, but luckily I haven't been travelling much in the last year.",

The loss prevention guys I worked with were very good at kid-gloving baseless accusations of theft while trying to explain that they were doing everything in their power to resolve the problem but could the guest kindly assist them by relaxing in their room and double checking items while they interview anyone who might have been in the room.

While training, my trainer explained that a man had recently shot and killed himself in one of the hotel rooms. I asked how they got all the authorities up into the room without other guests knowing and how they got the body out. \n\nShe told me it was a whole procedure, but that they were lucky that it happened during the day while surrounding guests were out so it didn‚Äôt appear anyone else even heard the gunshot. No one had reported anything unusual. But, essentially, someone monitored if guests are coming down certain hallways, and when the coast was clear, they brought authorities up through the employee elevators/hallways, quickly ducked into the room, then again waited until the coast was clear to get out. Then, when all was said and done with the authorities, the room was turned over for other guests. No one wants to have to explain police officers and a dead body to the family with young children next door. \n\nI never encountered anything like this while employed, but I did have to do wellness checks with management. Essentially, if family knew someone was checked in but couldn‚Äôt get ahold of them, we‚Äôd have to knock on the door and see if we could find them and ask them to call home. \n\nAfter days of not hearing from this one guest, I went to the room with a manager and he gave me a prep talk on potentially finding a dead body inside. Luckily for me (maybe unluckily for the family?)the lady had checked in and had left the room completely untouched. We never saw her, heard back from her, or located her.

If it still smells we might change out the curtains. Rooms still smell weird just not like smoke. \n\nBehind the scenes everything is disgusting. Your room garbage? Sometimes it sits by a service elevator for weeks because the maid wanted to go home and forgot about it. When I first started at a hotel someone left a half eaten plate of food on a cart for a whole month. It turned black then green then to a pile of dust. \n\n\nCockroach‚Äôs are everywhere. They spray every few months in guest areas to keep them out but that just pushes them to service areas. I literally had a cockroach waiving to me from inside our staff salad bar last time they sprayed. \n\n\nEverything is expensive because they are greedy they might make you think it‚Äôs expensive so they can keep paying staff when it‚Äôs slow but no they just stop scheduling people. Most the staff work at other hotels to make more money to save up for the slow times.  The only reason I see them needing that much money is because they do have more staff to pay compared to a cheap hotel. \n\n\nAs a vendor inside the hotel you‚Äôre forced to charge 4-5 times normal prices because the hotel wants 75% of the cut.  My company is inside a ton of hotels and we charge you the same amount of money it would cost to buy something brand new just to rent it for 1 day. A lot of people do end up buying the stuff from a normal store and throwing it away as a fuck you to the hotel.  We do give discounts for some clients but we have to get hotel approval. Or the hotel forces us to give a discount. \n\nWe have one client who we make no money on because the hotel wants to make them happy. They are the worst clients. Snobby rich snap their fingers and do my bidding type.  It‚Äôs supposedly some charity event but none of the people are very charitable and it makes about as much money as it would actually cost to throw the event.

Though MOST of the time you couldn‚Äôt tell the person was a dealer or prostitute but sometimes you‚Äôd  get someone in the music biz who would straight up bring crack heads in. We also had training and report sex trafficking. I actually did report the possibility of it once since I worked in a bar and can tell the regular prostitutes from something that seems off.\n\nAlso we‚Äôd get asked where to find stuff. Management knew and turned a blind eye on certain employees giving guest a hook up. These are usually the ones without a concierge. Now not everyone, there were certain upper management you knew probably wasn‚Äôt cool but many you‚Äôd know who‚Äôd turn away. Of course security knew, they didn‚Äôt care. \n\nOh and robberies were not uncommon. I knew of 3 the year and a half I was there and usually the whole staff didn‚Äôt know so these are just the ones I happened to be around and hear about. Most the time they did not want to contact the authorities. Probably because they did not want the whole story with drugs and prostitutes getting out. Usually they‚Äôd contact our security on it though, some had their own security who would talk with ours. Our security would kick out the prostitutes who had been accused of stealing from a guest if they ended up coming back. Lots of prostitutes hang out at the pool. It‚Äôs funny with the internet, they really hate when the reviews talk about that. \n\nThey do little to curb it though. I‚Äôm not saying always the case but if you leave a review after staying and mention prostitutes in the bar or pool then they might contact you to offer stuff to remove the review or ‚Äúmake things right‚Äù. Don‚Äôt make stuff up though, they may check the security footage to see what‚Äôs going on. Those reviews definitely are paid attention to and brought up during management meetings. Of course they will pay more attention to a frequent customer review than someone who stayed there one time. Women liked to complain about the pool hookers all the time.",

(I'm actually really curious, doesn't cocaine taste nasty? Why would you want it in your delicious food?!) \n\n\\- My manager regularly stayed in the hotel if we were under capacity, one night he ended up in an adjoining room. He heard the people in the next room negotiating their paid activities for the evening. Through two locked and supposedly sound-proofed doors. \n\n\\- We had a famous married guy stay with us because he trained in a space right behind the hotel. Even while his wife was pregnant, he was regularly bringing sex workers to the hotel. \n\n\\- The guy who owned our hotel chain was known to have had penis enlargement surgery. He was a really big fan of sex workers too. He would have his driver organise all the details, and then take them up to his amazing suite at the top of the hotel. The same suite (though not at the same time) that his daughter had a jelly bean party in. \n\n\\- Bedbugs are inevitable, but as soon as someone reports them, we get the exterminators in. Some hotels actually have monitoring contracts with exterminators so they can be active rather than reactive in dealing with them. \n\n\\- One of my colleagues (f) was once asked for the top selling pay per view films at our hotel. She was absolutely mortified because the top six were all porn, and she had to tell the COO that \"Naughty Nurses 6\", and \"Backdoor bandits VI\" were the most watched films. \n\n\\- We actually had a real scandal at my hotel just before I started working there. The hotel chain used an agency rather than hiring housekeepers directly, and they weren't paid by hours, but by rooms cleaned, with impossible cleaning times per room given. This meant that they could easily be underpaid because they weren't able to clean the demanded number of rooms in an hour. The agency was really terrible to their employees, but obviously the hotel was complicit in this, and didn't act until we ended up on national TV for exploiting employees who were mostly migrants and therefore not necessarily familiar with our labour laws. \n\n\\- I always wondered how management felt about us being really close to a lot of gay clubs. One day our security guard was opening an unattended suitcase as I was walking by. The owner of that bag was planning a big weekend! And by big, I mean almost as thick as my thigh, longer than my forearm, and ribbed for his pleasure. This epic phallus was accompanied by a leather hood, a gag, paddles, maybe a flogger, some handcuffs... So the small group of us who have seen this burst out laughing, to stop a second later when a beetroot on a human body storms out to where we are, at which point, most of us scattered, leaving security literally holding the bag. (For the record, opening the bag is completely the wrong thing to do, and if it had been a bomb instead of sex toys, this would have been a different story. What we Should have done, is call the bomb squad, evacuate the hotel, and let them burst out laughing when they investigated the \"suspicious item\")",

Anyways I sort of rambled there just to say these hotels are supposed to be at times 5 star hotels. \n\nThe Wyatt House that I worked at had a list of items and amenities listed on a piece of paper such as Beats headphone, yoga equipment, dumbbells, an intricate list of board games (by name), hair straighteners, hair curlers, video game systems, satellite radios, on and on. We did not have a single one of these items on the list and I don‚Äôt think we ever did. There were countless times people would come up asking for these things (especially the beats headphones) and of course we would have to lie and say ‚Äúwell someone is already using that item.‚Äù \n\nI had a bit of a problem with this because the occasional stubborn Guest would come by EVERY SINGLE DAY asking for a particular item and this would go on their whole stay (I think they were being intentionally annoying and I don‚Äôt blame them).\n\nWhen I finally got the guts to bring up how pointless I thought it all was in a meeting, I was met with awkward quiet dismissal. It was like I was bringing up ‚Äúthat one thing we don‚Äôt talk about.‚Äù Wyatt wanted to be able to list they had those amenities, but there was no way they were going to pay for them. It was our job to uphold this lie. And in the case that there was an actual issue? Someone was actually upset they were being lied to? Well guess who‚Äôs getting the bad review on the website. Madly-Bradly is. A review that will be scrutinized by Wyatt to determine how useful you are to them. \n\nTo say the least my experience there was not a very pleasant one.

They tried to get rid of me and I took legal advice and had to literally threaten the management with legal action for constructive dismissal if any of them even looked at me wrongly.\n\nNo good deed goes unpunished! And always ask the banqueting staff to keep the wine corks for you to count against the bill afterwards!",

But they are also the most expensive guests to host. The teams themselves are disruptive all night long, and they are destructive of hotel property like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. We spend more on repairs after hockey season than during any other point in the year. And as bad as that sounds, the parents are actually the worst. They can‚Äôt wait to dump the kids off at the end of the day. They don‚Äôt care where they are or what they‚Äôre doing. The parents will drink literally all night, even after bar close. They congregate in the lobbies and get louder and more vulgar as the night goes on. And the number of times that they don‚Äôt pay their tab after taking the entire team to dinner is just shocking. Usually they can be tracked down and it‚Äôll be charged to them one way or another, but the servers that waited on them and their ridiculous demands rarely receive a fair tip if they even get one at all. The weirdest part of all is how identical the situation is no matter how many different teams come through; it‚Äôs always the exact same problems. Always make sure there aren‚Äôt any hockey teams staying before you check in. I promise you that you‚Äôll save yourself a lot of regret.",

I was part of the department that sorted up incoming laundry. I can tell you exactly where are your missing belongings end up. \r\n\nIt's not that the maids steal them. People leave them on the bed somewhere where the maids don't see it and it gets gathered up with the laundry and sent to places like the one I worked at. We got phone chargers, jewelry, clothing, sometimes phones as well, all sent with the laundry. We gathered all that up and handed it to our boss at the end of our shift, so if the hotel called, she would have it and could send it back.\r\n\nIt also answers the mystery of where tv remotes go. Some hotels attach their remotes to the bedside table so \"people wont steal them\". I've always wondered why the hell people would steal a remote. Unless you have that exact model of tv at home it would be useless. But they're not stolen. They get swept up with the laundry. Remotes were the most common thing we got, because people watch tv in bed and just throw the remote aside when they're done. We could sometimes get 2 remotes in the same cart of laundry. \r\n\nMy favorite story from that place was when my friend found an old phone. It was unlocked so he tried to find someone to contact to give the phone back. But instead he quickly realized that it was a burner phone belonging to a prostitute. He spent the rest of the day messing with her clients, giving them prices at random and sending them to places all over town. Eventually the phone died.
