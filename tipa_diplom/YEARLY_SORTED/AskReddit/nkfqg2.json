There's also concerns about the national power grids and if they come under attack; if the electricity goes out generators run on gasoline. Considering that these states typically host the highest amount of diabetics with around 14-15% of the population on average, and insulin needs to be kept chilled - that's concerning.\n\nAs for people outside of the South, again, it's a scary situation. I live in Michigan and can vividly remember the Northeast Blackout of 2003. We didn't have power for 4 days, in the middle of the summer where the days were exceeding over 90F. There were issues with sewer pumps not working, there was an explosion at an oil refinery. \n\nI think a lot of people have lived too long without any hardship.

Long power outages are common in the winter, so a lot of people have gas generators and will stock up on gas for the winter and before the big storm.  What bothers me about all these stories is just the terrible attempts at profiteering - if you’re going to buy up gas for either your own purpose or re-selling...is it that hard to make sure you can actually get the gas out of your containers?  And is it that necessary to re-sell something that was for emergencies and only costs a couple hundred bucks?\n\nI have a couple neighbours that always stock up on too much gas for the winter. They store it carefully and gas up their generators when needed, but will typically have dozens of gallons left over. So in the spring, they’ll get their kids or friends to come over and gas up their trucks - usually people will bring a case of beer or whatever but there isn’t a set ‘price’. It’s a couple hundred bucks for basically winter insurance.\n\nSame with water - I always have a few cases for the winter in case of a long power outrage, and most springs I give them away to a local sports league or homeless shelter.",
