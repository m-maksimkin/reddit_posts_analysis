So house, carport, then another house in which I lived.\n\nAs I was moving in, the older dude, Chuck, that lived in the studio came to introduce himself and see if I needed any help. I didn't but I thanked him for offering and said I'd see him around as we were now neighbors. \n\nHe'd pop by every day at least once and I'd politely excuse myself and say I was busy, as I worked 60 hours a week and valued my free time. Of course he could see my comings and goings - I drove right by his studio and parked outside his door. I'd get home at midnight some nights and he'd knock on my door and ask if I wanted to hang out. \n\nOne afternoon when I had the day off he knocked on my door and asked me over for coffee. I could smell the booze on his breath. I told him I was right in the middle of laundry but if he wanted to come out with me and Hermione (our landlord) the next day when we were going to the coffee shop around the corner for breakfast  that'd be fine. \n\nWell.\n\nAt that point in my life I *did* sleep nude. At 11:00 that night I was awakened by **BANGING** on the front door, high-powered flashlights being shone through the blinds, and more flashlights being shone into my bedroom, all while men were yelling **OPEN THE DOOR! ARE YOU OK?! OPEN THE DOOR!** and there I am scrambling to get dressed. I know they could see my nakedness. I opened the door to a flashlight blinding me and a man shouting **IS THIS 160-B ADDRESS AVENUE?! IS IT?! IS THIS 160-B ADDRESS AVENUE?! WHERE'S CHUCK? WHERE'S CHUCK??!!** and all I could say was no, it's 160-C. Chuck lives right there, and point at his door.  \n\nChuck, it turns out, had real issues. When I turned him down once again he called the police to say he was suicidal, and the responders went to the wrong door and scared the bejesus out of me, a young lady in her early 20s who was living alone for the first time. \n\nTo add icing to the cake, Chuck was put into a psych hold and his relatives came over and accused me of sending him over the deep end because I wouldn't \"take pity on him\" and go out for coffee with him and hang out with him and date him. \n\nSo no, I no longer sleep naked.",

            "text": "I often would sleep nude when I was a teenager, until my mom and i moved in with her... Not so awesome boyfriend. One time he came into my room while i slept in and in an effort to \"get me out of bed\", he ripped my blankets off where i was in my birthday suit. He quietly apologized and left. Now for any normal step parent, you think this would be a one and done situation. Nope, he would continuously try to catch me again and rip the blankets off, in addition to other shady shit. \n\nEventually i just never felt comfortable or safe without wearing some amount of clothes to bed. This feeling persisted for many years. Thankfully, they broke up.\n\nEven now i still don't feel fully comfortable in the nude, despite living with my fiance for the last 7 or so years.",

The house was on fire.  I jumped out of bed and stumbled one foot at a time to  put my underwear on before making my escape.  \n\nI should have used the window, I probably should've ducked below the smoke when I decided to run through a burning house, and it probably shouldn't have taken what seemed like an hour to get the door unlocked.  But when the adrenaline was pumping in full-blown panic mode, I did dumb things.  Fortunately I made it out with only second degree burns and singed hair.  \n\nI'll never forget the fireman's response upon arrival,  - \"whooo!  you was in there?!  Son! you's a gnats ass away from being a statistic!\".   Then he told me something like 90% of people killed are within 5' of the exit, and it's not the flames that kill, it's the smoke that gets them.  I think back on how long I fumbled with the lock and the time it took me to locate and put on my underwear.. \n\n I now replace the batteries in my smoke detector and sleep in my underwear.",

T-shirts, underwear, bedding, and other thin fabrics are truly gross after being worn and used day-in day-out without a wash.\n\nThis is also why showering in the morning instead of before bed to me makes no sense. Going to sleep oily and dirty just ensures your sheets, bedding, covers are all just as oily and dirty.

And when it reached over 9000 i can at least use the boxers to position and retrain it in a way so it isnt as annoying\n\n- lastly, a little bit of stuff might come out. When i did it with my gf or myself somewhen close to before going to bad, and also who knows when i might have a wet dream again, wearing boxers prevents me from having to change sheets on the occasion, and also usually help with that stuff not getting onto my own skin, instead gets \"caught\" by the boxershorts.",

I'd say now it's a learned habit because if I try to sleep without at least a shirt/underwear combo, I just can't do it. I'm uncomfortable and feel exposed. I also pee at least twice a night and had roommates all throughout college, so even into my adult years it was necessary to have PJs.\n\n My friend once said she used to sleep naked, but then there was an emergency and she had to get out of the apartment in the middle of the night. She couldn't mentally sort out clothes so just had to grab the blanket, which made it super hard to wrangle her baby, so she's pretty sure she flashed her highly conservative neighbors. She was mortified and always wore clothes from then on. \n\nSo I guess for some of us, it's a learned habit, and for others it's due to a bad experience.",

So I would sleep naked under the thinnest sheet I can find. \n\nOne day, I was in my rack sleeping, and I hear a loud boom. It shakes me awake. I open my eyes and see my friend wet, scared, and wearing a life jacket. He throws me one and says we need to go topside because we‚Äôre sinking. \n\nI have no time to grab my clothes so I run topside with a life jacket and nothing else. \n\nWhen we arrive topside we see the captain and most of the gunnery crew standing around the deck gun chatting, I‚Äôm confused. They see me naked with nothing but a life jacket, they‚Äôre confused. My friend begins to hysterically laugh. They were conducting training and testing on the weapon, and he was tired of seeing my dick hang out from under the sheets everyday. \n\nThat was the day I stopped sleeping naked.‚Äù\n\nR.I.P.
