When looking at the whole vagina, the vaginal opening is quite low down, near where the labia lips end. The most sensitive part of the vagina is right inside the opening. Further back toward the cervix can cause pain if repeatedly interacted with. The urethra is a small hole for urine above the vaginal opening. And above that is the clitoris. It is a visible ridge, sometimes larger like a button or even like a small phallus, and has a hood over it. It is not difficult to find or stimulate. Clitoral orgasms are often more sensitive and long-lasting than vaginal orgasms, but vaginal orgasms often have a lower refractory period. \n\nIf you have a partner who has a vagina, know this. If you have a vagina and you have a partner who doesn't know this, you deserve better.",

These bones form your hard palate, and there is a relatively rare birth defect called a “cleft palate” which causes the roof of your mouth to be gaping, leading straight to your nose.

The supraorbital artery travels through them. \n\nYour blood *CAN* contain mercury, ~~and that is what blood pressure measures.~~ A sphygmomanometer is the device used to measure blood pressure,~~and it returns a value measured in “mmHg,” meaning millimeters of mercury.~~\n\nYou can feel your pulse by feeling your arteries. Everyone knows about the carotid artery and the one you can feel on your wrist (radial artery, I think). You can also feel your pulse on your inner pelvis, at the femoral artery. The aforementioned supraorbital artery is incredibly small, so it is hard to feel, but yes, you can feel your pulse on your eyebrow. \n\nIt’s been a bit since I learned some of these in my anatomy class, so I may have messed up some small things.

When it is not fertilized, the body releases the blood and unused egg. This is why women have a period and bleed every month. Almost all abortions occur within the first three months of discovering fertilization of an egg has occurred, which would otherwise pass as a regular period had it not been fertilized. Thus, women only need to take a pill to trigger their period, and experience the same thing they would as if having a normal period. So, an abortion does not involve an invasive “vacuum” tearing apart the fetus or “baby” like most people assume. It’s simply a pill that triggers a normal period. Blood comes out of the vagina, and there is no visible “fetus” at all. This is something that often happens naturally without a pill, and without women even noticing a difference between that and their regular period, because the “abortion” is roughly the invisible size of the egg they pass every month. \n\nThere is so much stigma about having an abortion as if it’s “killing babies” in a brutal way, versus a woman experiencing her period the same way she has it every month. So many men assume an abortion is some kind of awful “miracle of life” that is wasted away, without consideration of how women’s reproductive organs function and bleed 12 months each year.",

However, our cells have a safety feature when this happens, which is to send out a certain signal to alert our immune system, which will then go ahead and kill the cell as well as deactivate the virus. They won't kill the virus, as viruses aren't alive. They're just a bunch of code, wrapped in a protective case.

The reason those ligaments are important is because they protect the meniscus (a special bit of cartilage between the upper and lower leg). If that gets damaged, then you start to feel pain, and eventually will be grinding bone on bone, which is painful. While tearing your ACL (or other knee ligaments) hurts, if the meniscus isn't damaged in the same injury, you could probably walk on it the next day, albeit somewhat gingerly, as long as the terrain is pretty tame. The reason the recovery period is so long, is because it usually involves surgery and rehab (again, in order to protect the meniscus).",

The pressure change closes that hole, because now you need oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Babies who don't have this closure occur need surgery, and are often referred to as \"blue babies\". Similarly, the ductus arteriosus closes at birth with the pressure change, and simply becomes a ligament. \n\nTL;DR baby hearts have shortcuts for blood flow, infant hearts can't have that, so they close when you're born",

And that's true for all mammals.

As evolution proceeded, the shape of the animals changed greatly (particularly with the development of a neck, which the fish lacked), but the RLN just kept getting longer, because that's MUCH easier for evolution to do than re-routing a nerve.

Like, more than I should have to because some of these guys don't pay attention in class.\n\n4 flavors of hypoxia:\n\nHypoxic hypoxia: Not enough O2 getting absorbed into the lungs. There is still literal tons of Oxygen to breath, even at altitude, but since the pressure is too low your lungs can't get enough. Like you're trying to drink a milkshake that has been served on a platter instead of in a glass. Same amount of milkshake, just spread too thin to drink efficiently. \n\nHypemic Hypoxia: Lungs are working, but for whatever reason your hemoglobin (red blood cells) cannot transport the oxygen. Common cause in aviation is carbon monoxide poisoning, which sticks to your red blood cells, taking up the space oxygen would instead. You can take a long time to die from this. Like, even if you go to 100% oxygen, you might be too late. Check your heaters, kids!\n\nHistotoxic Hypoxia: Lungs are working, blood is working but for whatever reason your body tissues aren't picking it up. This can be real bad news for the brain. Common cause amongst ~~pilots~~ people: alcohol poisoning.\n\nStagnant hypoxia: Lungs are good, blood is good, body is ready to receive but the blood just can't reach where it needs to go because of high G forces. Too many positive G's = blackout, because your blood is draining away from your brain. Too many negative G's = red-out, too *much* blood is in your brain. \n\nBonus: Hyperventilation.\n\nSome knuckle-dragging dirtwalkers get stressed out when they fly, so they deal with it by breathing hard. This upsets the balance of CO2 and O2 in your blood by replacing too much CO2. But isn't CO2 something that needs to be removed anyway? Yes, but we need some in our blood to tell the brain how hard to breathe. If it can't detect enough it assumes shit's going down so you breathe harder and harder until you pass out. If you have a passenger who is breathing hard and nauseous or chilled, it might be hard to determine if they have hypoxia or hyperventilation. When in doubt: treat for hypoxia. Hypoxia will kill you stone dead. Hyperventilation is a self-solving problem because eventually you pass out and you can't stress yourself out when you're asleep.",

It was a surgery he hadn’t considered doing before, but he was 99% positive it would work. They filmed it to teach other surgeons. \n30 years later, I go see an Orthopedic  surgeon about knee pain, and he asks about previous surgeries.  I begin to tell him about it, and he asks if it was  Dr. Sherman Coleman that did it.  I asked him how he knew that. He replied “because I watched the film and was tested on it” \n\nTurns out that doctor was a legend and a pioneer in Orthopedics, and he was fucking spot on.

Some species of sharks and crabs are thought to use sand and rocks they find in their environment for this purpose.\n* Your eyes can actually see a little bit of infrared, but it's super dim compared to the rest of visible light. If you look through undeveloped film or another appropriate filter you should be able to see an infrared world - white trees, dark sky, glowing hot objects. Don't do this though, as your eyes will dilate wide and you'll be likely to get UV damage.\n* You breathe out of one nostril at a time. Your sinuses swell alternately (over hours) due to blood flow changes so that at any moment you're mostly using one side or the other.",

It's relative size would be looking at a disk the size full moon in each eye.  The reason we don't see a two large black blind spots in our vision is that the visual cortex of our brains interpolates from what it predicts should be there from information from the other eye, movements of the head and eye darting about looking around this gap, in order to in order to 'fill' in this missing information normally captured by our photo-receptors.  We can sometimes notice this effect by means of the disappearing dot illusion, where having two marks on a piece of paper (like a dot spaced apart from a little x), spaced out apart then closing one eye and staring at  the x as you bring the eye forwards and backwards until suddenly the dot  vanishes.       \n\n\nTechnically speaking, the reason this illusion works is that we don't 'see' with our eyes, we see with visual cortex of our brains.  The visual cortex is located in the occiput, name given to the lobes at the back of the brain. There is a rare condition called Anton's Syndrome where (most often) injuries to both the R and L occiput, say from bilateral strokes)can damage the visual cortex, making what would be a giant blind spot.  But such an affected persons does not 'see' such a huge hole in their vision, as other parts of the cortex drag over, patches in, and even outright makes up what it 'thinks' you should be looking.  Persons with Anton Syndrome, also known as visual anosognosia, will adamantly deny they are blind and will relate what their brain thinks it should be looking at, often completely bizarre and made up items items.",

The cool fact is that mri scans can detect trans peoples brains as they don’t match cis peoples brains but the brain of that they identify as. \n\nAnother cool feature is when you take the opposite sexes hormones your entire body reacts to be that of the opposite sex. So for trans men they get big and buff and get morning wood and their voices drop and they grow beards like cis men and trans women grow boobs and get curvy and loose their muscles mass and energy and some get a monthly cycle (without the blood ofc) on top of that you basically lose your birth given sex advantage in sports like for mtf they supress most or all of the T in their body’s so they are actually weaker and at a disadvantage compared to cis women. And trans men they get hella strong and can get agressive, plus if their short they have a bigger advantage as they’re Center of balance would be lower to the ground making them more advantaged in contact sports like mma. It’s actually really interesting because we’re on the stages of seeing if transgender people can get reproductive transplants, so far the research hasn’t suggested it be impossible so it’s pretty unique cuz it really makes the human body look like a meat computer. We can change out parts and work better based on our engines and software. \n\nAnother interesting thing I know about the human body is if you restrict its growth as a child your body will mold to a abnormal shape.

This helps your ears pop when you go really high up, and it is also why you can taste eye drops or get a runny nose when you cry. \n\n**Eyes:** the eyes have an immune system that is separated from the rest of the body. that means that if something from the eye happens to get into the rest of the blood stream, your body will attack it the same way it attacks a bacteria or virus\n\n**Brain:** your brain has a center for forming words, understanding words, and a part that connects the two. if you damage the forming/motor part you always know what you want to say but are unable to say it. if you damage the understanding part you speak fluent sentences but with random words that no one can understand (most of the time, you don't realize it). interestingly, if you damage the connector, you can speak mostly fine but cannot repeat words or phrases.\n\n**Heart:** \"broken heart syndrome\" is actually a real thing. when experiencing a significant amount of emotional/physical stress, stress hormones cause a portion of the heart to squeeze super tight so that the normally egg-like heart looks like a mushroom. this can obviously affect the hearts function and lead to death :(\n\n**Lungs:** smoking is absolute shit for the lungs. Not only does it cause cancer, but the constant irritation from the smoke eats away at the air sacs that make up the lungs and causes them to collapse, trapping carbon dioxide inside without escape. because of this, making smokers feel like they cannot breathe out all of their air. this can be so stressful to the body, people can lose 20-30 pounds from trying to constantly breathe all that trapped air out. don't fucking smoke.\n\n**Stomach/Intestines:** the gut secretes a protein with the same structure/make-up as snake and platypus venom. this helps protect us not from predators, but from bacteria and microbes that want to live inside of us\n\n**Liver:** the liver can regenerate itself. if you literally cut off 2/3 of the liver, it can regrow itself in about 2 weeks like the second leg of a gecko or something\n\n**Kidneys:** your kidneys actually are responsible for signaling the body to make more red blood cells. many people with bad diabetes or kidney failure actually end up anemic because their kidneys are so sick, they can't make the hormone needed to make this signal.\n\n**Muscles/Bones:** the muscles have special organs in them that will sense the amount of strain they are generating. if the strain crosses a certain threshold, these \"golgi tendon organs\" will shut the muscle down to prevent the muscles from breaking the bones they're attached to.\n\n**Skin:** many common skin conditions look completely different in people with light skin vs people with dark skin (look up \"eczema light skin\" vs \"eczema dark skin\"). Most medical textbooks unfortunately only represent these conditions in people with light skin, but there is a growing movement to document skin conditions in people of many different skin tones to better train the next generation of physicians\n\n**Reproductive System:** there's a condition called 5-alpha-reductase deficiency where people are born with what appears to be female external features. however, once they hit puberty, the giant surger of hormones often causes these individuals to take on a more masculine appearance. these individuals take on either male or female gender roles, and some cultures actually have such higher rates of this that there's a separate \"gender\" category for them",

That’s because our brains bypassed their natural defences. Peppers are hot to protect themselves. We developed a taste for them over time because most peppers have about 3x the amount of vitamin C as an orange. Our bodies will develop a palette for foods that are good for us.\nA story of a dude trapped at sea on a lifeboat; he recounted how he had no problem catching fish for food but was still getting weaker even though he had drinking water too. He said that all of a sudden he had the overwhelming urge to eat the eyes, organs and roe of the fish. He’s never wanted to and hasn’t since but at the time it was delicious. That’s because most fish meat has almost no vitamin C in it. But the organs do. His brain made those parts seem delicious in an attempt to get the nutrients he needed to survive.\n\nOur brains can dilate time. Kinda. In extreme life or death scenarios our brains can become super charged and process info faster. When people talk about situations where a few seconds felt like minutes; this is what they mean. We’re able to process more info at a rate we aren’t accustomed too and this makes it seem to us as if time has “slowed”. Time is relative. I have had first hand experience with this and it’s kinda nuts when you look back  and realize how much went through your head in a moment.\n\nIf you flattened a brain out it would be about the size of a pillowcase. Most other animals have smooth brains. The reason ours have creases is because through evolution, our cerebral cortex evolved more and more rapidly to accommodate our growing cognitive functions and because a bigger head would just look ridiculous, our bodies made the great decision to fold in on itself. \n\nI am not a brain expert, I just think they’re neat!\n\nAlso, a preserved human brain feels like wet clay.

There's a good reason for that. It “samples” the light signal being sent from each eye along the optic nerves as they head toward the back of the brain for visual processing. The suprachiasmatic nucleus uses this reliable light information to reset its inherent time inaccuracy to a crisp twenty-four-hour cycle pertaining to the daylight-nighttime hours, thus preventing any drift. That's the reason why people feel \"jet-lag\" when they go to another time zone, because their circadian rhythm is still acclimatized to the time zone of their country. This also means that if a person is completely shut off in a dark cave without light, the brain will still take care of his periodic sleep cycle and ask him to sleep every 15 hours or so.\n\nAlso, everyone has a different circadian rhythm. Some are \"morning larks\" while others are \"night owls\". So sleeping late at night and waking up late doesn't mean they are lazy or addicted to mobile phones. It simply means their rhythm is more inclined towards sleeping late at night. So be proud if you sleep late. It's isn't your conscious fault, rather your genetic fate. But remember, SLEEP IS IMPORTANT FOR THE BODY.\n\n(Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker)",

There are 3 formulae I know of(one just for didactic purposes, or fast orientation Because it overestimates). Well the other 2 have a general formula for caucasin males. If you are afro-american/asian/woman some correcting factors must be applied to obtain the correct value.\nImo this need to apply correcting factors is because of evolution and hormones. Different climate/geography/diet lead to different adaptive changes so you can function properly, in the best conditions.\n\nWhat I found weird, many consider using this correcting factors as racist, which is not. Because your ancestors lived in a different climate, with a different diet, the body adapted. This is Not really specific to race, what I want to say is that it doesn’t really matter who lived there, the human body would’ve adapted anyways in time.\n\nEven if it would be racist, why would you refuse to Let doctors use it? Not using it would lead to over/underestimating the renal function and many problems in time because of it(Not treating in time/treating with drugs when Not needed).\n\nDoctors don’t use these correcting factors(found after who knows how many studies and trials) to demean you, but to have the correct overview So they can treat you in the best possible way.\n\nAlso, there are drugs specifically made for afro-americans. You can say it’s racist if it has the same composition as the one used for the general population but the effect is lower, or it is more expensive. I don’t really know if this happens, But I guess not. The drug is for afro-americans because you sometimes have different receptors and the effects of the specific drugs are significantly better.",

            "text": "Not many people realize just how crazy sweat is. Almost no other animal does it, and it's incredibly useful. A lot of people think that our brains were responsible for us becoming so great at hunting, but I'd argue throughout most of our species' history, sweat has been just as useful, if not more useful, for catching the next meal. \n\nIn hot climates, one of the biggest limiters on how much an animal can exert itself is overheating. A cheetah can run insanely fast, but only for short bursts before it overheats. Almost all prey and predators in hot climates rely on short bursts of energy to hunt/escape. Think like a cat pouncing, or a gazelle leaping into the air. \n\nThe problem is, once they start to overheat, they can't cool off. All they can do is pretty much just pant, and try to find shade and rest. On the move, there isn't really a good way that most animals can cool off, so instead they just have to move slowly, or in short bursts. \n\nHumans almost have a superpower, because sweat allows us to cool off while moving. Even in hot climates, as long as we are hydrated, fit, and acclimated, we can keep at a jogging pace for hours, possibly even days. If you were to organize a marathon between all the land animals in the animal kingdom, humans would likely come out on top, or at least in the top 5. We can even outlast horses over long distances. \n\nWe became \"endurance hunters,\" a special kind of hunter that chases our prey until they collapse. It wasn't even fair for our prey, like at least with a lion they could evade it, but we would just chase them for hours, never letting them rest or cool off. Eventually they would collapse, unable to run any further, and then it would be an easy kill. Hell, sometimes we wouldn't even need to kill the prey, they would do it themselves thanks to heatstroke. \n\nLater on, with the development of weapons, we started to become ambush hunters, but for most of our history, we hunted simply by outlasting our prey. While this made us vulnerable to ambush predators, it allowed us to hunt basically anything we could track. Didn't matter if it was the fastest land animal in existence, it couldn't outrun us. \n\nSo next time you are all sweaty, think about how incredible of a superpower we all have that we take for granted. How we can outrun almost every land animal in existence, as long as it's a marathon, not a sprint. How, on a sunny day, rather than having to find shade or frantically pant, we just have our own, built-in evaporation coolers, all over our body. \n\nThen go take a shower. Just because it's awesome doesn't mean it doesn't smell.",

Your eye doctor can spot certain heart problems, and thyroid issues as well.\n\nMost healthy adults don't have significant prescription changes.
