We once had a fight and I read her diary. She described the stress dreams of being at catholic school, at being in love with me, and not understanding what her identity means. At that point, I was filled with deep regret that I had always known all those things and never considered how profoundly they impacted her. From that point forward, I fiercely defended her identity, showed no shame in showing affection, and fought off people that bullied us both for our respective weirdnesses.\n\nI regret invading her privacy in that way. her thoughts are her own. And she had given me all the clues to figure it out on my own. I shared a lot of her struggles but I didn't SEE her. I joined in at the jokes about her short her, and how she should hit on female teachers. I regret deeply not having seen sooner how terrible that is.\n\nIn a nutshell, I joined in what I now regard as bullying my best friend for being a lesbian (they all suspected but thought it can't be possible, so to them, it was just insulting Mimi that she resembled a lesbian, I can't properly explain. Catholic school kids are MESSED UP), and I read her diary, which changed my beahviour. That was still not okay.\n\nWe are still friends. I am a man now, and she a proud lesbian person that is still figuring out her gender.",

I saw this happen numerous times so I can only imagine how much of it was going on that I didn’t see. The girls usually just said “hey!” and swatted the groping hands away like it was no big deal.\n\nNow I know that what was going on was repeated sexual assault and most if not all of those girls were probably extremely upset, even if they didn’t show it at the time.

The damages ranged from obscene drawings and degrading words on the girls cars, dents from baseball bats, cracked windshields, and car key scratches all over the paint. Luckily, I laid pretty low in HS so my car was overlooked but if you rolled with the popular crowd, they did not spare you. Girls had to drive home in tears with whore, bitch, slut, etc. plastered all over their cars. It was awful and it probably added up to at least 20k+ in damages. Surveillance caught the whole thing but it was at night so they couldn't identify anyone UNTIL this one junior girl who helped organize the whole shit show started showing people the videos she took that night. Word spread and 12 of them were suspended. Apparently they were laughing their asses off the entire time while climbing on car hoods and roofs to go to town with aluminum bats and had an absolute blast with the horrible names. the school had to get rid of the senior lot after that and did away with senior and junior field trips after I graduated.",

It was a folder of girls’ nudes as young as 13 that all the boys had. No one spoke up about it really and the one girl that did was bullied. They ganged up on her and threatened to spread her nudes around if she kept speaking about it.\n\nThen a girl who had cancer shaved her head and posted that she was happy she was beating it. The boys thought it would be funny to spread her nudes around everywhere calling her “cancer girl”. \n\nThey would randomly go up to people and ask them “do you want to see (enter random girls name)’s nudes??” “Tits or ass?”\n\nA girl got her top pulled down and the boy never got in trouble. Instead, they told girls that we weren’t allowed to show our shoulders because they were “sexually provocative to male students and teachers who were looking at young girls every day”.\n\nWe also had KKK members at our school who would wear the white outfits and go around harassing minorities. (We were on the news 3 times for racism and other schools shunned us because of how bad it was)\n\nBoys would openly talk about sex dungeons where they wished they could lock girls up and torture them and sexually assault them.\n\nBecause of all this happening, the school had an assembly where they said “Sending nudes has consequences”. Never once did they ever talk about how spreading nudes is child porn and you could get jail or juvie time for it.\n\nAll my school ever did was promote misogyny and racism. The principal’s own son hit a girl in the parking lot where she fell and hit her head. All the boys thought that hurting women was funny, and guess what? They were ALL religious. \n\nAt the time, a lot of us just brushed it off. Most guys laughed and didn’t care. \n\nBut now, I wish I had spoke out and exposed all those motherfuckers. They got lacrosse scholarships, and went on religious mission trips while girls got life long trauma and shame. \n\nThe most empowering moment I ever felt was right when I graduated and matched with one of those misogynistic idiots on tinder and I screenshotted our conversation and posted on my story for 300 people to see. \n\nBasically I said “I would never get with a piece of garbage who sent girls nudes around and terrorized women for laughs”.

In the 8th grade, a girl in my class had sex with a super senior. They were discovered and both students were expelled. At the time, everyone blamed the girl for being a “slut who got the best football player expelled.” Not one person was mad at the guy, but everyone demonized her badly. Even the teachers contributed, saying how sad it was to lose such a good football player and that the girl caused him to stumble. \n\nYears later, I realized how absolutely fucked up that was. This was not just some teenagers messing around and getting caught, it was a 19yo man who raped a 13yo girl, and everyone blamed the girl. I cannot even imagine what it was like for that poor girl to be taken advantage of and then demonized by the entire school while her rapist was mourned over. Absolute trash. This situation is a huge reason why I have turned away from Christianity. I hope she is in a better place now.",

This is one of the worst things i've ever done to someone. \n\nOur friend (let's call her Jessica) had this older man in her neighborhood who was a family friend of her mom and step-dad. She had expressed to us in the past this man was pretty creepy towards her and made her very uncomfortable. For example, she once found him in her room picking through her dirty clothes, with the excuse that he was going to help her with her laundry. But, as is often the case with high schoolers, she didn't feel like she had any actual proof and that her parents wouldn't believe her, so just kept quiet about it all until she told us in confidence as friends. \n\nOn April Fools my junior year, my friend (let's call her Trish) and I wanted to pull a prank on Jessica because she had done something to annoy us recently. I don't even remember what it was, which speaks to how incredibly dumb this all was. We decided it would be hilarious to borrow someone else's phone who she didn't have in her contacts and text her pretending to be the creepy guy. During homeroom we sent her some pretty fucked up texts, things like \"see you through your window tonight\". \n\nJessica, understandably, flipped the fuck out and had a panic attack when receiving the texts. She went to the nurse and then the principle and told them everything. Her parents were called into the school and it was only then that they identified that the number wasn't the creepy guy, and at that point another mutual friend who knew about what Trish and I did spilled the beans. \n\nThe most shameful part about this for me is that Trish and I still thought it was funny as all hell even after getting caught. And so did a lot of our mutual friends. Jessica, after recovering, laughed along with us though in retrospect she was clearly pissed off about the whole thing, which was confirmed in ensuing months as she slowly broke off her friendship with us. It wasn't until I went to college and started to really examine the kind of person I was in high school that I began to feel ashamed for it. Both Trish and I did offer Jessica a heartfelt apology, but at that point it was two years too late. Neither of us have spoken with her since. \n\nI guess if there is any silver lining, her parents did listen to her about the guy and he was no longer invited to their house, and ostracized from the neighborhood in general. Not sure what ever happened with him long term though. \n\nMorale of the story: posing as a stranger sexually harassing your friend over text is an absolutely shithead thing to do.",

One kid jokingly asks the tough kid “How much $$$ would it take for you to punch the bully?”  He gives an answer, probably not really thinking it wasn’t going anywhere but one thing leads to another and kids start what amounts to a grass roots verbal Go Fund Me campaign (long before Go Fund Me or even the Internet was a thing), pitching in spare change.  Goal is reached, but by this time, the bully got wind of what was happening.  Bully is the first one out of the lunch room, with tough kid and probably 40 other kids chasing because they want to see it go down.  Tough kid finally catches up to the bully just as a teacher steps into the hall and realizes something’s going on.  She tries to get between the 2, tough kid reaches over her and punches bully just once, stops and let’s the teacher escort him to the office without objection.  It was like one of those TV shows where someone ends up killing the perp out of revenge right in front of the cops and turns around and holds out their hands to be cuffed.\n\nClassic case of teenagers and hive mind.  Looking back, the bully really wasn’t even that bad.  It was more the threat of being beaten up than him actually acting on it, and it probably was somewhat of a survival mechanism given his personal situation.  But when you’re in junior high, you don’t exactly have that wisdom and maturity, so the idea of finding a hired gun seemed like karma at the time.",

            "text": "Pretty late comment so I doubt anyone is going to read this story, but it has stuck with me my entire life and I still think about it from time to time.\n\nWe used to have a girl in my class, Jordan, who was severely overweight and autistic. Kids being as ruthless as they are, always picked on her for being different. Instead of \"yo mama's so fat\" jokes they'd say, \"Jordan's so fat\", among other cruel things. Whenever she'd get frustrated with them she would hide her face in her shirt and cry. Well, the reason why she was overweight was because weight gain was a side effect of the medication she had to take for her autism, but most kids were too naive to care or understand.\n\nI was one of the few people who felt sorry for her and understood her, because my brother has autism. We sat next to each other in 4th grade and I would help her out with her school work if she was confused and would reassure her that things would be okay in times of trouble. She then saw me as an ally and would show me her drawings and the good grades that she would get from time to time. I'd always give her compliments for both.\n\nAfter that year, I never saw her again. That summer between 4th and 5th grade, she came down with a rare disease and was hospitalized. To this day, I still don't know exactly what it was. But she ended up profusley bleeding into her stomach and puking it all out. She died within five hours from blood loss.\n\nOnly about 20 kids from our entire class came to the funeral. It kinda pissed me off, but I assume most of them who didn't come did not feel welcome because they were ashamed of the way they treated her.\n\nWhen I got there and saw a few of my peers, the select few of us who accepted her for who she was, standing in front of her coffin. I joined them. It was open casket. We all stood in silence. I guarantee none of us have forgotten that moment. Ten years old, seeing one of our peers lifeless. I mean she looked lifeless. The mortician tried their best to use makeup, but her body was so pale that you couldn't hide it. It was a traumatizing sight. The whole thing was just so sad.\n\nA few weeks later, her mom had a garage sale to sell most of Jordan's stuff. Partly because it pained her mom to see her things around the house, and partly because her mom needed the money after the hospital bills and the funeral. She worked as a dishwasher for the high school, so it wasn't the best paying job.\n\nWhen I got to talking with her mom and she realized my name, she started bawling. She told me that Jordan talked about me all the time at home. I was her closest friend in our classroom that past year. She thanked me for being her friend and hugged me for what felt like an eternity, and I didn't mind at all. She took me inside and let me look at Jordan's drawings in a sketchbook, (her mom didn't sell that for obvious reasons), and I stumbled upon a drawing she made of me and her sitting at our desks with big smiley faces. I couldn't fight back the tears. Her mom rubbed my shoulder and cried with me.\n\nWe sat for a few hours and her mom told me countless stories of her late daughter. I enjoyed listening to them. I got to know her better and it made me beileve knowing those stories that a part of her will live on in my memory. When I left, her mom let me keep the drawing she made of us. I still have it to this day.\n\nThe whole thing was quite a traumatic experience for everyone in my grade. But I guess in the long run, it brought us together as a class. It opened our eyes to the blatant fact that we bullied a kid and now she's dead. After that realization, we all had an unspoken understanding that it was wrong and we'd never do it again. All the way up to graduation, we never had a single fight within my class. Everyone was just so nice to each other. Even though we had our cliques, any one of us could sit down at anybody's table during lunch and we'd let them jump in the conversation.\n\nRest her innocent, beautiful soul. Her untimely death inadvertently brought peace and understanding to our entire class.",

My friend wasn't really a big fan of him since the teacher would always scream about him to do his work. \n\nJimmy had gotten so tired off it he said he was going to record the teacher and edit it to make him say some racist things and show it to the principal. I watched him make it on discord cause your able to show your screen on that platform, when he finshed he transfered the video onto his phone.\n\nNow i knew jimmy for almost 6 years and knew he wasn't that type of person so i thought he wouldn't do it,\nWell not until the principal walked in during our hour and told our teacher if he could have a serious talk with him about 10 mins later our teacher walked back in and had this sad look on his face.\n\nLater my friend jimmy told me \"i showed the principal the video, he just got fired i think\". I told him \"WHAT!?\" He didn't respond back, i was in so much shock cause I never thought jimmy would have a huge grudge against a teacher. I later told the principal that our physics teacher didn't say those things and that my friend edited it.\n\nthe next day i didn't see jimmy so i texted him saying \"wya??\", he responded saying \"you got me expelled you snitching son of a bitch\". \n\nI know i may sound like a fake friend but that video could have really ruined my teachers life, i haven't talked or seen jimmy in 2 years but i hope hes doing better now.",

During my freshman year at our camp a large trashcan full of it was dumped over the head of this one girl who was bullied a lot. I look back and wonder why no one in charge (school staff and alums who volunteered) stepped in to stop it. In hindsight, the girl had a lot of emotional issues due to a screwed home life (as far as I know)… then to go through that public humiliation must have been a nightmare.",

The teacher left to go deal with it for quite some time. \n\nA while later this kid just disappeared. It was a big school so I didn't think much of it.

Turns out, the story of what happened to him spread through the school like wildfire. A bunch of people started calling him \"shit bag\" and relentlessly tormented him for a few months. He had to switch schools it was so bad. I felt terrible.

All of his classes had a reputation for being very unruly and rowdy.\n\nSo when I was in high school, flicking soda bottle caps with your finger across the room was the big thing to do. So someone flicked a bottle cap across the room and hit him in the eye. He did not enjoy it, as expected. Toward the end of the semester, our principal was sitting in on his classes to make sure we behaved. On the first day back from winter holiday, during the last period which I was a part of, the principal asked him to come with him, and a Brother took over. He was a Brother of the Catholic brotherhood that my school was named after. Think this - a 6’6 older guy with a booming voice raised on the south side of Chicago in the 40s. Needless to say, we were scared shitless when he came into the room and fucking wrecked our lives for being pieces of shit. The young teacher wasn’t seen again as he got fired because we were a bunch of assholes who made his life hell. Makes me feel like shit to this day",

            "text": "I suppose this was just out of high school, but the rest still applies. My friend had a crazy girlfriend. Insanely jealous, always skeptical about what he did, where he went, or who he was with. Sometimes they would get into arguments and she would just go nuts yelling at him. Now he’s the most docile, least angry person I know. He would always just sit there and take it or calmly argue his case, but was never aggressive or hostile, even in his tone. One day I was over at the place they lived and I could hear her yelling at him in the other room. Now we (me and our other friends) always made fun of the fact that she was nutty, even to my friends face because deep down he knew, too. So when she would start yelling at him for no reason or for reasons nobody should yell, it was kind of a joke for us. So I hear her going off and I turn on the computer camera and start recording. You can hear her yelling from the other room, but eventually my friend comes into the room with me and sits next to the computer. She later walks in and continues the fight, even going as far as kicking or hitting him. At the time, this was hilarious because she’s so small and probably didn’t do much damage if any, so I was trying to hold it together. My friend himself was even laughing a bit, probably out of embarrassment more than anything if I’m being honest. \n\nI even uploaded the video to YouTube. It went viral and got about 2.2 million views. I have since took it down as per his request and looking back, none of it was really funny. It was pure abuse and I feel so bad for laughing about the situation. I’m sure the video is still out there somewhere, once you post something, it never really goes away forever, especially if it went viral. But if I could go back, I would have still filmed, but for legal use instead. Hitting and yelling is not okay, please be nice to your SO’s everyone.",

This child who was a friend of mine, one lunchtime, produced some eggs from her lunchbox, causing me to gasp and tell her to put them away before she was caught (the school at the time actually had a \"secret police\", who were essentially students secretly recruited by teachers to spy on other students who might potentially engage in wrongdoing). \n\nHowever, at this point, a rather cruel grin spread across her face and she told me she was planning to plant the mushed-up egg in the salad of the allergic girl, for reasons that were not entirely clear to me at the time, or which I cannot recall. She then went off, smiling with devilish glee. I didn't tell anybody, partly, I think, because I wanted to see what happened. Looking back on me at that age, I'm pretty sure I didn't really have any concern for the wellbeing of anybody who was not part of my immediate friend group. \n\nI'm not entirely sure of what happened to the egg girl in the end (my friend told me she hoped she died, though I'm not sure what she had against her to be honest), but when I was seven and a half years old I halfway across the world to New Zealand and never saw my friend again - which I think was probably a good thing.",

I wasn’t surprised at all when the story made its rounds through the school that day and for the entire week. Keep in mind, these are kids that were riding the school bus together for their whole lives and the bus ride was about 45 minutes long due to all the stops the bus had to make. When I moved across town, I was close enough to school to walk, or my older brother would give me a lift (during his senior year and my freshmen year). The story goes that the boys were acting rowdy in the back of the bus and one of them held a girls arms behind her back while the other one ripped her shirt open and exposed her chest. Again, these are kids who grew up together and had been discovering typical high school party life. It was a major violation. I remember there being absolutely massive rifts that were formed in that social (I wasn’t part of it, but my class size was about 150 for the entire run of the school system). The mental gymnastics that some of these kids performed to protect each other, the girls included, was unbelievable. The girls basically wanted to address the situation, but forget about it, so as to not get the boys in such deep trouble. The boys were claiming that the girls were playing along and refused culpability. Honestly, it was nothing short of a full-blown sex crime. The one girl who was victimized, was so upset/embarrassed. I think that was a real wake up call for her. I ended up catching up with her at our 10 year reunion a few years ago. She seemed very well-adjusted and easy to talk to, which was the opposite of how I remembered her in high school. This girl was very popular. I did not see her associating with any of those individuals involved at the reunion. As expected, the boy who was the greatest perpetrator in that incident was an absolute drunken mess at our reunion. I was in charge of creating the playlist for the event and after a couple of hours, he unplugged my phone and plugged his own phone in, taking away any musical sentimental value from the event, but whatever. I specifically remember him screaming at his Uber driver on the phone because the roads were becoming slightly treacherous due to a light snow storm coming in. The whole thing was bizarre… It made me think about how some people reckon with their past and grow from their mistakes consistently. Then there are other individuals who never change. Hell, some of them do grow, but they grow into even worse people. I’d like to think that everyone who is aware of that incident many years ago realizes how terrible that must’ve been for that young girl.",

The guys who did this thought it was hilarious. I ended up walking home because I was tipsy and didn’t feel safe riding with anyone. The party continued and as the crowd thinned out, the guy videotaping recorded a sexual encounter between one of my friends and her boyfriend at the time in a back bedroom. My friend was drunk and I assume her boyfriend was too. My friend had no idea she was being filmed. Flash forward to the next Monday at school, everyone was talking about the party and laughing about the video, etc. These guys, in particular the one doing the videotaping, did mean and horrible stuff like this all the time and a lot of people thought it was funny. Because there was so much talk about it, our school principal caught wind of it and ended up somehow getting his hands on the video tape. Everyone got in serious trouble. We were each called individually down to his office and had to call our parents. Charges were filed. Anyone seen on the tape (myself included) had to go to juvenile court for underage drinking. I had to do community service as a punishment and my mom was not happy. Those involved with the sexual assault (that’s absolutely what it was looking back) had to watch the video with their parents at the order of the judge and had harsher punishments. It was an awful time, especially for my friend who had been taken advantage of. She was taunted and made fun of afterwards by all of these “popular guys” for doing something sexual on tape - typical victim blaming that women face all the time. She missed a lot of school and needed counseling. The guys were seen as just having fun and being guys. It’s all sickening to think about now.",

I didn't wanna go to school the next day, but my mom wasn't forgiving enough to let me do that and I had to go. After that, until my hair grew back, my friends essentially called me a \"bald ladyboy\". I wasn't the most slim kid back then, I had more pounds than other kids (for which I got picked on by the guys who were a grade higher than me at the first place. Because of this, I also had a bit of chest fat, which made it look like I had boobs). So, basically... as someone with low confidence at that age, because he got bullied by some douchebags that were older than me, I got bullied by my friends as well, because my hair was shorter than it used to be. Safe to say, I don't talk to them anymore (besides one of them, because his parents on a snackbar, to which I go to get dinner for me and my family. He's cool now.

Spent a few months on crutches and a couple years in physical therapy, any hopes of high school sports pretty much smashed.

First grade..principal Got all the girls in the bathroom to try and identify who had deposited an upper decker.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

Teacher tied me to the desk with a skipping rope to prevent me from wandering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.in an effort to try and fit in with other girls in grade 4, I brought an assortment of bras that my mother never wore to pass around and try on. Of course a gaggle of students at lunch together in the accessible bathroom stall was absolutely noticed. Didn't help that my mom was the homeroom teacher.\n\n\nETA:\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Grade five and six the girls would go around and punch each other in the tit during gym classes.. This was done to your friends and foes alike, all were targets.. Developing boobs hurt enough already...\n\n\n\n\n6. Also in gym class we'd get the bottoms of our running shoes wet on a paper towel, so they'd grip better when we ran, but if a boy had hairy legs we'd drag the Damp runner down his calf to try and rip the leg hair out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Pantsing or shorting, or atomic wedgies were all completely acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Chewing tobacco spit into Ziploc bags and left in the storage space of the desk. Sitting at the back of the class room during 6th grade (12 yrs old, girls).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. We used to have a school sanctioned initiation day. Sixth grade students would be dressed in as an embarrassingly as possible fashion, by their 9th grade over seers. Running the gamut from a diaper and bonnet to a full ballgown on a male and everything else we could collect from our parents closest or garage... Throughout the day we were subjected to all sorts of demeaning tasks, led around on leashes, being personal slaves for the 9th grade students. At lunch time we were paraded around the basketball courts outdoors and then forced to eat disgusting foods, run relays, carry raw eggs in your mouth, pretty much anything gross or embarrassing.. I begged to stay home from school that day, but my parents were just too excited to see me go through it all.. My brother, two years my Jr, made it to grade nine and his class took initiation day too far, and they had to ban it from the school after that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. In grade seven I had a teacher decide to cut my hair in front of the home economics class because I had a bad haircut. To be fair she was a former hairdresser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. We had options classes like band, drama, art etc.. But we also got to take agricultural class where you learned all about farms, crops, animals etc.   We had another options class that was hunting and outdoor survival. I got my firearms license, learned how to gut a deer, and survive outdoors for a few days in a Canadian winter by grade seven. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. End of the year party on the last day of school at our teacher's house where we had slip n slides in her back yard and ran around in swimsuits at 22c...not exactly swimsuit weather, when you factor in the winds of anywhere from 50-80kmph all day. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Stinky kid in class gets taken to the infirmary, made to strip down and put on clothes from the lost and found while teacher throws her clothes in the school washer and dryer because the teacher couldn't take the smell any more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. When my brother was 10, he got into a tussle with another student. Minor dust up, maybe a bloody nose, but mostly hurt pride.. The same day, after school he's riding his bike and the other kid's mom saw him and ran out of her house tackled him off his bike and proceeded to tell him what she thought about their fight.",

The object was to sneak up and hit another guys nuts with small objects like nerf balls, hacky sacks, teddy bears, e.t.c. without getting caught. If the thrower got caught sneaking up and/or the victim caught the object; the victim had a free shot with the object on on the thrower which was enforced by any nearby witnesses. The witnesses would catch the thrower and hold their arms while they got their punishment.  Punisment was the victim either thew the object into their nuts or got give them a boot-in-the-ass. That's why many of the objects being thrown were soft; just in case it or you was caught.\n\nI never really partook in throwing but enforced a few free shots in my time. lol",

Looking back he probably was on the autism spectrum but there’s no way to be sure.

Chad was seen pretty universally as a huge asshole all around school though he was a fairly good football player and wrestler and was a very military-bound kind of guy. (He later did go into the marines). Well chad had a well known history of picking on max. Well Chad was changing and was completely nude, and max was trying to talk to him about something. I don’t remember the exact exchange, but it’s clear max is trying to get chad - “the big cool senior” to like him but chad is generally being a dick. Eventually it comes to a point where chad turns and chases max across the locker room - tackles him to the ground -and dry humps him from behind on the floor of the locker room.

My drama teacher 10-12 grade took it very seriously and we had physical work outs for 45 minutes before the start of rehearsal each day for our competition one-act play. He said he wanted us to have the best butts of any theater group. \nOur drama teacher was gay, which seemed pretty cool and edgy considering we were in Texas and next door to our high school was a Southern Babtist church, and this was the 90's. So when our teacher made jokes about our butts, it seemed harmless. Or at the end of year party when we gave out awards, some went to \"the best butt\" or (myself) \"can you tell I'm not wearing a bra\" as I was known for being a hippie and my lack of undergarment was of course everyone's business.\nFast forward to a few years after my class graduated, our drama teacher was fired for trying to form \"inappropriate relationships\" with male classmates and a few who had recently graduated, AND, this was the reason he lost his previous teaching position.",

We said some not nice things related to looks and sexuality that I definitely regret.

So one day, he decided to try shouting out really bad swear words to see what the teacher's reaction would be. She was writing some long-essay on the board. The place where I'm from, swear words are not appreciated at all even from adults, leave aside middle school students. His friends joined in ofc. They weren't shaming the teacher or anything. It was basically like \"Ma'am, this motherfucka is explaining how he fucked my mom\". Worse than that, actually. \n\nThe teacher chose to ignore their words, for some reason. At times, each of those boys would get up and go around asking everyone to tell them the worst swear word they've ever heard so that they can keep shouting them. Again, she wasn't the kind to scold someone for getting up and roaming around the class. This continued for around 30 minutes. Ever after she stopped writing on the board. After that, they started shouting things that even included her.\n\nStill the teacher didn't say anything to them. Idk what happened after that.

Hell, they’d show them to some of the teachers. \n\nThe only issue I ever saw come of it was actually over ammunition.

With no barrel to direct the force, the slug didn’t have enough energy to do more to him - but it could have been much worse and cleared out the GROUP very quickly. \n\nBy the time any teachers or administrators arrived, there were only a few of us helping our friend with a headache.

They let them loose inside the school and for some reason the principal had 2 really out of shape staff members trying to catch them. Took less than a day to catch all 3 of the chickens but they kept looking for a chicken with the number 3 on its side for nearly a week. It was an amazing prank since it caused no damage, didn't hurt anyone, and it was pure genius. The chickens did kind of shit all over the school but they cleaned that up easily.\n\nI still find the prank funny hell to this day but the seniors who orchestrated the prank felt kind of bad about it. They stopped the teachers that were still looking for the #3 chicken that didn't exist and came clean. The teachers were angry as hell at first for having wasted so much time but one teacher said \"Man that is the most exercise your fat ass has had in years. As for the prank it was the best god damn senior prank he had seen in the 30+ years that he's been teaching\".",

I was targeted because my parents were in a contentious divorce and both had behaved very badly in a way that fucked with the community. I was 11 when this started, and clearly had absolutely no control over my parents behavior. Since my parents had a slightly disproportionate amount of wealth and power where we were no one was willing to retaliate against them directly. But once the children, parents, and teachers at the school realized that they could get away with bullying me…I mean it was open season. I was SO hated based solely on my parents destructive behaviors (and they were also abusing me at home!) that I had nothing to do with. Kids and adults were *gleeful* in their mistreatment of me. I’m not sure why it didn’t feel as hellish as it should have at the time, I think I just went numb…but thinking back on it as an adult who’s the same age as many of the teachers who participated and endorsed the bullying, I cannot believe that they thought this was ok. \n\nI actually ran into my old science teacher recently who’d been a pretty big perpetrator to the point that I almost failed freshmen biology because she “accidentally” lost all records of my turned in work and laughed at me when other students destroyed the visual aspects of all my presentations. When I ran into her as an adult, I had the privilege of being in a position of authority otherwise I think she’d have completely dismissed me when I addressed her abusive behavior towards me in school. I asked her why she’d thought that was ok, and if she regretted it. She said “it wasn’t just me! It was everyone! What I’m going to risk my relationship with everyone I work with to stand up for some spoiled rich kid? Obviously you turned out fine, anyway”.",

Well my two friends took out the trash and just happened to have a matchbox with him. Some might see where this is going already.\nAnyways, he takes out the trash and when they come to the paper one they dispose of the matchbox in the paper trash can. Only before they did, they lit a match and put the lit match inside the matchbox, dropped it and waited. \nNow for these trash cans you need a keychain rfid Tag to open and you can’t see down into the container when the latch is open. To prevent kids from doing the stupid thing of jumping in. So when they dropped the lit matchbox they couldn’t really see anything happening. After a minute of waiting they went back to class.\nWe had our classroom it the 2. floor and these two just sat and gazed out the window waiting to see if something happened. After some time something did happen, a small amount of white smoke started to leak out the trash can.\nThis is when my friends starts to panic.

Started with just playing with my hair or books, but she eventually started forcing motorboats onto me. She was an early bloomer so most of the guys spoke pretty vulgarly towards and about her, so when everyone saw that happen, they got really jealous of me. Didn’t think too much of it at the time, but if the roles were reversed, I’d imagine it wouldn’t go well for me. \n\nAnother one was in senior year of high school. I was sitting next to the door in my class when one of the female classmates entered, kissed me on the cheek, and then walked to her seat. I didn’t react at all and kept talking to my friends, but their demeanor totally changed with me after. I didn’t really know the girl and I’m sure it was some kind of dare or something, but when I think about whether or not this was appropriate, I can’t help feeling that if I wasn’t so dead inside (I was also s u p e r depressed which is why I had literally no reaction and kept talking normally), I could’ve reacted poorly since I was groped by several older family members when I was younger. \n\nI never tell these stories because I feel like I’d get the same reaction as the other dudes around me at the time gave me, but i also don’t think those girls meant to hurt me or anything. I think they singled me out cuz I was the quiet nerd. No hard feelings (heh) at all towards them, but I hope that consent is something that is taught to go both ways. For context, I was short and fat with glasses in middle school and still short but not as fat in high school.

My friends bought a yellow colored gatorade, then took it to the bathroom and filled it with piss, so it was 50/50 pee and gatorade. They left it on the table, we all waited for him to grab it after lunch, which of course he did. He took a sip, looked at it funny, took another sip, then threw it away as we were all dying laughing a good distance away. A couple years later I thought back on that stunt and realized that was super fucked up lol",

In high school my classmates would sometimes play a game called \"Who's the Jew\". They would throw money on the floor, sometimes a quarter or two but sometimes a one or two dollar coin. The first person to pick up the money was dubbed \"the Jew\" and mocked. Sometimes they'd push over \"the Jew\" when he was bent over picking up the money. Thankfully there were no Jewish people in my school to feel hurt by this. I'm Jewish now (I'm a convert) and look back and cringe, but I wasn't Jewish or very knowledgeable on antisemitism then, so I just thought it was weird. \n\nI knew this next one was fucked up at the time, because I was the victim, but everyone else thought it was funny. I was/am severely mentally ill and would have catatonic episodes nearly every day in school in my last year of school. Students - and even one teacher - would play a \"game\" where they tried to get me to move by throwing increasingly bigger things at me. It started with coins and tiny pebbles, then erasers and pencils, and so on. The biggest thing thrown at me was a stapler, by the aforementioned teacher.\n\nThis next one I also knew was fucked up, and so did some of the students who knew about this, but some students found it funny. The same teacher from the second story forced my friend to sit next to his rapist in class because the teacher didn't like my friend. My friend ended up dropping out because of this. This teacher also told my friend to kill himself.\n\nThere was a (married) teacher who was asking some of the girls for nudes and inviting them for sex. He was 24 and they were 17-18. Because of the small age gap some students just found it funny that he was trying to cheat on his wife. But he was their teacher - he had a position of power over them. I knew it was fucked up then but I didn't realize how bad it was until later.\n\nI have more but that's probably enough.

I took her on one date to show her how different we were, and while it definitely showed that, she said she was willing to change.  Her family was very Christian and republican.  Anyways, she would follow me around a lot. \n\nMeanwhile, I was also complaining to my best friend on AOL, and he began to message her everything I was saying, that she was boring, she needs to learn more, experience life, how I just didn’t like her.  So she just started giving me the cold shoulder and I thought, that’s weird.  Then she started to really like my best friend.  After about two weeks of the same puppy treatment towards him, he told her flat out, “I definitely don’t disagree with IdentityS, you are everything he said, you need to be who you are.”\n\nSo about two weeks later, she comes over to the lunch table we are at and drops off a letter.  It was basically saying, we weren’t as cool as we thought we were and that we are assholes(we weren’t popular, just generally well liked, and got along with most people).\n\nSo we took out our red pens and started correcting her letter.  Underlining mistakes in sentence structure, spelling, and basically grading it like an essay.  We gave her a D-.\n\nWe gave it back to her.\n\nI used to tell that story all the time as a joke, but now I realize we were assholes.\n\nHappy Ending though she ended up with another friend of mine about a week later.",

The teacher asked him \"what the hell are you doing.\"  He sarcastically said something like \"what do you think? I'm jerking off!\" The teacher grabbed him and marched him down to the principal's office.  I can't remember if he was suspended for it or not, but the rumor got out that he got busted masturbating. We all pretty much took it as gospel truth and the guy got taunted relentlessly in the hallways. \n\nI ended up befriending his younger brother, who explained to me what actually happened, and I felt so horribly for the guy.

This went on for a solid 5 minutes while Tom was just shouting, asking them to stop.\n\nAfter the attack everyone just laughed it off and carried on with their lives, even Tom and Mike stayed good friends after that. But now thinking back, Tom was literally molested and raped by being forced down by 4 men, and I don’t know how he truly felt about it. Whether he just had to laugh it off to fit in or if it bothered him inside. Regardless, it was super fucked up and I never realized until years later that this was actually sexual assault that took place at our school. This was 10 years ago as well so people were less likely to take shit like this seriously. Those dirt bags should’ve been reported to the police for what they did, let alone faced the school’s punishment.",

Most of his behavior we put down to being a rich kid with abandonment issues, as his single mom worked all the time, though his brother was a really nice guy and didn’t act at all the same. He had problems with authority and we thought he was on drugs because he developed physical ticks and mumbled to himself all the time - drugs were a big problem in our small town, so it’d be easy to procure and he had the money to sustain the habit. He was also very sweaty and never wore deodorant, so he smelled rank. We had no sympathy because he was a raging asshole and insisted that he was better than us all, which made pretty much everyone dislike him, even teachers. Once a friend of mine broke into his locker to put deodorant in there, and we would mock his ticks/mumbling often. When my boyfriend at the time got blank cards with his CAH expansions, we created a deck about this kid which was popular with our friends. When I returned to my high school during college to help with makeup for a show, he refused to shave what we called his “pube stache” despite the director telling him every day to do so; I went and got cheap razors/shaving cream and forced him to go into the bathroom and shave after telling him “You’re supposed to be Pinocchio, not Pornocchio.” \n\nAfter he graduated high school (and didn’t make it into Julliard like he insisted was his right), he was quickly diagnosed with schizophrenia. On the one hand we felt bad because of how we treated him when it was at least partially due to his unknown illness, but on the other hand he was awful to everyone (especially his girlfriend) even before the symptoms started. Obviously we no longer make fun of him, but my husband and I still talk about it from time to time, and we still have that deck.",

Basically bullying her because she posted a lot of work. It was stupid but basically every kid in that class (mostly 10th graders who did it, the 11th graders who are in my grade liked her excwpt for maybe like 3 or 4 but it's the usual dick heads) would go up to the principal and basically make a complaint about her and when he got enough complaints he went up to her class during school, actually I was about to head to her class and basically before he said anything to her she said she quit and now she got a job at a different school and is getting paid shit tons more then this school did. But it was still stupid and I never thought it was funny. She got angry at one point in the year where she had to leave during class and walk around the hall and get some year cause the same kid doing his same bull shit everyday.

What are the odds. The teacher watching the room is really watching what's going on because he's ready to go home as well and he's in and out of the room talking and laughing with the other teachers. Some of the other people sitting close to the outlet guy are egging him on to stick the pen in the outlet. All of a sudden he does it. He's holding this metal pen and he pokes the outlet. There's this loud pop and flash of light and the lights and power go off to several class rooms. Teacher isn't in the room and all he knows is the lights have gone out but doesn't know why. I heard this loud cheer from the other class rooms and this guy is a hero for a couple minutes. Teacher finally walks back into the room, rolls his eyes and goes looking for the breaker box to reset the power. We have about 2 minutes left until the bell and the lights come back on again.

I’ve always hated going to my math class because my teacher was a cranky old lady who’d yell at you for the smallest things. Me being an 11-year old, I actually had the worst anxiety just knowing I could be the next person yelled at in front of the class. The one thing that helped get through the year was that friend cause I knew he’d always make jokes and have me almost in tears cause they were *that* funny. \n\nOne day, when my teacher walked out to use the bathroom, that friend went over to her desk, picked up the mug she was drinking out of, and spat out the biggest loogie into it. We all saw it and just waited for her to come back. 10 mins later, as she was just normally teaching, she picks up her mug and chugs it down. Everybody just starts laughing and giggling, including me, but nobody said anything when she questioned it. It was horrible but I wasn’t about to be the kid who snitched.\n\nLater on during the school year, I guess we had a day where it didn’t start at the normal 7:30am but instead 10:30am, but I didn’t know so I showed up really early. A bunch of kids didn’t get the memo so we were all just placed in the cafeteria until school actually started. Around 9ish, my math teacher noticed I was sitting out in the cold and invited me to her class where it was warm. When I got there, she let me work on my missed homework and even let me eat breakfast in her class. She asked me about home life, school life, if I had any friends, etc. she made me feel welcome. She then told me about her life, about her only son, about her husband who passed away from cancer 20 years back. She was very sweet. \n\nThis was like back in 2008, and I think she was like 70 years old. I don’t even know if she’s still alive after all these years. But I wish I could go back and stop my “friend” from doing what he did. :(",

Curtis (the weirdo) decides it will be cool to spray deodorant on his arm, and set fire to it. 2 guys from the year above us get involved and spray (upon Curtis's request) a lot more deodorant on his arm. He sets fire to it himself... and it does NOT go out. It was on fire for a good 15 seconds, before he turned on the shower in a panic. Everyone though it was either hilarious, or fucked up, as I did.

All 6 of us kids get called into a class room at school, during school time, with a police officer. It turns out that Curtis has been questioned by his mum, with the fact as to why he had 2nd degree burns on his arm. He blamed us... and his mum wanted to press charges. He had said that one of the older kids sprayed his arm and the other lit fire to it, whilst we all cheered it on and it was against his will. This was not the case, as he was the class clown attention seeker prick. We all said a similar story separately and he was then known as a lying asshole and nobody spoke to him again out of us all.

It was always the same teacher and it happened every year. I’d heard about it, so when I ended up in her class in 8th grade, I was always hoping she’d never need anything from that closet. Well. The day came when she needed something from the closet, and she went inside to grab it and already there were conspiring whispers in the class to lock her in. One of my classmates went and shut the door and it locked automatically when it was shut—with no way to unlock it from the inside. She yelled and begged us to let her out and told us we’d be in big trouble. I sat there just frozen. I didn’t wanna be the one who went and opened the door because I didn’t want everyone hating me or locking me in too, but I also didn’t want to leave her in there either. Everyone was laughing and making jokes and finally the quiet kid got up and opened the door and let her out. She was furious and we all got into trouble. Part of me wonders why she didn’t anticipate people doing that after it had been done every year for so many years, but the other part of me thinks maybe she just really wanted to believe the next year would be different.",

There were dozens of fights. Every couple of months you'd hear a story about how somebody grabbed a girl's boob or butt. Kids would pee all over the bathroom floor. There was a tech ed teacher that always seemed like he was hitting on girls. There were boys who would trick girls into doing jumping jacks so they could watch their chests bounce. I broke the nose of two different kids and ran a kid down in the hallway for stealing from me and beat the hell out of them. I beat up two other kids for trying to steal from me in photography class. There was always those kids that were kind of weird so everyone would torment them endlessly. My friends made napalm behind the junior high on the track field. We stole computers and monitors a few times. We watched one of our teachers have a mental break and rip an announcement speaker out of the wall and throw it out into the hallway. Some kid took lifelike baby dolls from the parents teaching class and strung them up from nooses before Japanese class and hung them all over. There was that kid on the bus who would throw moldy food and milk and things like that on kids as they walked by the windows. My friend's girlfriend tried to undress in front of me I guess to seduce me? And her ex-boyfriend tried to hunt down and beat up my friend between classes. There were a few kids who got hit by used feminine products. I had a teacher who would give kids flat tires in the hallway, which is stepping on the back of their shoe and sock. I had a teacher who would give Smarties candies to kids who got good grades and dum dum suckers to the rest. There were a couple kids who almost drowned in the pool, one time they had to call an ambulance. There was the gym teacher who punched one of his students in the back of the head. There was the kid who got caught masturbating in English class to the hot teacher. There were multiple kids who got caught looking at porn on the computers at the library. We would also routinely screw up the computers before tech class so no work could get done. Some of my friends stacked like a dozen chairs on top of each other and climbed on top of them to fight each other with sticks and one of them fell and broke their elbow. We tried to have jousting matches with kids in the parking lot. My friend got a new car and immediately wrecked it doing donuts in the parking lot of the coffee shop. A few days later we destroyed that coffee shop when our friends band played there. We took a bunch of caffeine pills one day for the hell of it and I had some sort of weird reaction and fell asleep in the middle of the hallway. There were a couple of times of kids coming to school either drunk or high. There were always lots of people cheating on tests and exchanging homework and just stealing work from each other. I've seen four or five teachers cry in front of their classes, both intentionally and not. This is just the stuff I was able to come up with off the top of my head, there's definitely a lot more",

On the last day of school the day consisted of students signing each other's yearbooks. A girl who sat next to me in English saw me sitting there alone. Being nice, she asked me to sign her yearbook. I wrote something small and cliche, yearbook space is precious. Behind her sat another kid, the quiet trenchcoat wearing loner type. No one was asking him to sign either so she asked him. What a mistake that was! He basically wrote a kill letter on a full blank page of her yearbook. The gist of it was how he hated everyone at the school, in what way he wished to kill them, and how he would spare her life since she let him write in her yearbook. When he gave the yearbook back to her and she read it I could tell she regretted having let him write in it, but also she laughed it off and showed me and others what he had written. We all laughed.

She used to slap all the other girls on their butts, and most would awkwardly laugh along with her, and even do it back.\n\nShe would tell people that her favorite, though, was mine. I never did it to anyone. But she did it to me very often.\n\nI should mention, I have C-PTSD. In highschool, I had been misdiagnosed due to my narc foster mother not letting me speak to my doctor's alone (she decided I was bipolar, and told them so, despite my never seeing a therapist or psychiatrist before), so I was on a lot of medications that definitely only numbed me, instead of actually treating anything. Looking back, I often felt like a piece of vaguely sentient furniture.\n\nThe only moments where I could feel myself finally coming back, even only temporarily, was when I got mad. My boyfriend at the time (thankfully my ex now) was EXTREMELY abusive. Just really fucked up, tortured me regularly, etc.\n\nAs a drama kid, we had to get to the school much earlier than the times the shows would start. So, one evening, as we were starting to get everything set up and good to go, I was even quieter than usual. No one knew, at the time, that it was because my abuser had been kicking and hitting me on my legs and back for at least forty minutes, stopping as people started arriving (he could hear them walking through the main doors, despite not seeing them from around the corner).\n\nThis girl is a person who would later in life tear me down emotionally by telling me how fat and ugly I apparently was, and would jump between that, physically hurting me, gushing over how cute I was, and touching me in ways I consistently told her I was not comfortable with. \n\nShe runs up behind me as I am helping with setting up, and smacks me, hard, on my ass. It hurt. It hurt a lot. Mainly because I was already injured. So, like any traumatized person, my immediate reaction was a fight or flight response.\n\nThen, much like now, I would almost always react with fight. So, she hurt me. I swept her legs out from under her, and shoved my boot down on her sternum to pin her. Apparently I was completely silent, with an unmoving deadpan expression as I knocked the wind out of her. \n\nIt was very much like an out of body experience. I remember it as though I was watching it, despite being involved directly. \n\nObviously, I know my response was over the top. I only found it funny in a weird, superiority-complex sense. On the rare occasions I still have to deal with that treasonous, back stabbing, spineless insect, I will still get a faint thrum of amusement from remembering the shock in her eyes when I reacted and pinned her.\n\nI definitely didn't find her \"game\" funny, but she definitely thought it was the best time to be had. But it wasn't. It was stupid and inappropriate, and definitely not an okay thing to do. I hope she's realized that now, but I highly doubt it. \n\nThese days, after ending our friendship, then giving it another shot, and then her ending it again because she's definitely an \"all take, no give\" kind of person, I have no contact with her. Or, I would, aside from the rare occasions she decides to send me a message on whatever social media I have yet to block her on, to tell me to kill myself.\n\nLast I heard from her was after my dad died in June of 2020. Telling me that she'd \"drink [herself] to death too, if [I] were [her] kid.\" And that she hopes I \"join him soon\".",

My best friend at the time (now my ex best friend) would make fun of me for it saying how bad of singers they are and that they’re “not that great,” etc. One April Fool’s Day, she told me she entered me for a meet and greet contest with them and that I won. I didn’t believe her because I knew what day it was, and she eventually fessed. I laughed it off at first but in the back of my mind I was disappointed.\n\nLooking back, though they seemed to be “harmless jokes,” it was not okay for her to tease me like that especially since I recently found out that I have ADHD. For those who don’t know, people with ADHD or other neurological disorders have something called a hyperfixations, which is where an individual latches on a topic, subject matter, activity and even celebrities that interests them. Well, guess what my hyperfixations were in middle school? The Jonas Brothers alongside Twilight, Justin Bieber, and Sonic the Hedgehog video games. It definitely explains why I went in such a defensive mode whenever my ex best friend made fun of them. \n\nIf she never made fun of me for my interests, I wouldn’t be as scared on sharing my current interests/hyperfixations as I am currently\n\nEdit: I know, not as bad as some of the stuff people are saying in this thread, but I was going through so much bullying back then that I latched onto hyperfixations as they were the only thing that made me feel safe and comforting, and it just happened to be the music of the Jonas Brothers and their content was that comfort.",

But I think by far, one of the worst things they did was to a girl they tormented for years. Let's call her Amy, for the sake of simplicity.\n\nAmy was a crybaby. At least that's how she was described to me when I joined that school in 5th grade. Because she was so quick to cry, everyone bullied her incessantly. Things were so bad, once in 5th grade, she drank a bottle of liquid paper thinking it would kill her (it was non-toxic). Everyone in her classroom laughed at her and made her cry worse.\n\nA few years later, in 8th grade, poor Amy had to go to the bathroom. While she was out, her biggest bully (let's call him Gabe) got into her backpack and started tossing all her things around the classroom. At the very bottom of the bag, he hit his jackpot... He found a plastic bag with some pads... And blood stained underwear. Gabe then threw the pads around the room and hung the bloody panties on the window, in full display.\n\nI felt really bad about it, but being a complete wuss (plus peer pressure), I didn't dare say a word.\n\nWe all watched as Amy walked back to the classroom. As she turned at the door, she froze for a second and pointed at the panties on the window and yelled, \"HEY, THAT'S MINE!!!\"\n\nI wish I'd been a bigger person, but the reaction seemed so over the top that I couldn't help it. I burst in laughter along with the rest of the class. Amy then proceeded to grab her now empty bag and walk around the classroom collecting her things, sobbing the entire time.\n\nThat was her last year at that school. Eventually we found out she was also severely abused at home, by her parents (especially her strict, religious father). I have no idea what became of her after that, but I've always felt so guilty both for laughing and for my inaction. I think back and I wish I'd stood up for her, but I was a dumb coward.\n\nI truly hope wherever Amy is now, she's found happiness and tranquility.",

Boys were paying attention to me because I was a new girl and really fun (I grew up with 3 brothers so I was a bit of a tomboy). One boy had become friendly with me because he liked one of my friends and we sat across from each other. The desks had a metal wall in the front so you could only see the students' feet. Most of the desks were in groups facing each other. So I would grab his leg with my feet and bring them up to my side. My friend and I were laughing about it and we thought we were just teasing him. He was really shy and didn't really say anything for us to really stop. He said ow but was laughing while it was happening. It wasn't until years later I had something hit my shin in a similar way and instantly had flashbacks to how much we were probably hurting this kid. He had to have insane bruises. I'm surprised I didn't break his leg. 20 years later and I still think about it.\n\nThe thing my classmates did:\n\nIn high school, there was a kid that sat next to me and a few bullies/class clowns in homeroom. This kid was weird. He had failed 10th grade like 3 times, his voice was kind of messed up, and he was pretty overweight. Every morning they made fun of him for all of the above. It was so awful because the teacher didn't do anything and he couldn't leave the classroom. One day they parked their cars so close to his, he couldn't leave.

We later learned from his ex wife there was some serious domestic violence stuff. We also learned recently from his brother that his current girlfriend/ baby mama and him have also gotten physical. There’s been a whole bunch of other shit he’s done and never been held accountable for. \n\nIn short, dude hates women and thinks it’s ok to put his hands on them.

(which at the time, i didn't know how wrong it was) for some reason i can't explain, i was a very horny kid. like, when i was 5 i used to get the girls dolls and flip their skirts up, did the same with a doll refrigerator magnet at home (which my mom noticed and lead to her buying me a playboy magazine so i could \"end my curiostity, which clearly backfired), peeked under girls skirts, things like that. when i was a little older, like 12/13, i used to take photos of the girls and such... AND I FUCKING HATE MYSELF FOR IT NOW\n\nthis is the type of thing that comes to mind when i think about my past, which makes me very depressed. a girl even had to move schools because i traumatized her, by asking everyday to be my girlfriend. and nowadays i pay the counciousness price... it's heavy\n\nso much that sometimes i feel like the heavy bullying i was submited to everyday because of me being fat, was actually deserved because i was a garbage human being.\n\nand my classmates also did a lot of bad things, but i didn't in any moment find it funny...\n\nthe girls ruined the math teacher life by saying he was a pedofile because almost everyone got a 0 in a test. all the boys (me included) tried to intervene and told the principal, but the girls told their moms and the moms went to defend their cubs like lionesses. in the end they cleared the situation but the teacher asked to leave and went in front of the school and made a speech on how he deeply regreted the decision of becoming a teacher.\n\nand in the same year, 10-15 kids of my class tried to kill one of our classmates (i heard them making a plan to lure her behind the church, because she had to pass there to go home, and beat her up, and throw her corpse in the river, and i saw them, everyday, for a week, going together straight out of school to the church). just because she called another girl fat whale (after the other girl made a racist comment about her). i was actually the only friend this girl had after calling the other one fat, i was her friend before and i saw what happened, the other kids sided with the other girl because she cried and made herself as the victim... they didn't managed to do her any harm, because she stopped going to school. i don't know if she was sad because, before things scalated to that point, the other kids stayed over a month without talking to her, or if she somehow discovered their plans. (at this time, phones weren't a thing, and i didn't knew where she lived to warn her... so i basically, just found reasons to beat up all the kids involved, one by one throughout that week)\n\nand a kid once got up to sharpen his pencil with a \"estilete\" (a knife-like blade used to sharpen pencils manually by scraping off the wood, i searched, it's apparently called snap blade) while the teacher wasn't in class, he stopped at my table, took my paper airplane, cut it in half, put the blade part in my throat and said: \"gonna do something about it? hã? you want to die right now? i tought so... bitch\", everyone started laughing and i got mad... when he removed his hand, i punched his hand, he dropped the thing, i punched his face, i got the thing... and then, and only then, the other kids tought something was wrong and stopped the fight.

I wasn't trying to be funny, it was a serious question I was looking for an answer to. Being someone who was confused about a lot back in the day. \n\nAlthough not a joke, some kids laughed. Rather than give the question some thought, or take it as a serious question the teacher walked up to me and slapped me across the face hard. I believe she said something about I should be ashamed and this is serious... which I was was being. \n\nI remember being in total shock after that, She never explained further and went to the next question. \n\nSome kids also laughed at me getting slapped as well. I'm pretty sure I also tried to laugh it off later, but nothing about what happened was okay or funny. It was a great opportunity to explain how sexual attraction and biology aren't 100% connected and a great chance to open dialogue about non same sex relationships. But maybe she was against it? Idk, hard to say. \n\nTLDR - asked the teacher a serious question in sex Ed and got slapped by her.",

She allowed the students to do a lot of inappropriate things and when it was lunch break some of us would sit at her desk and she would tell us her private life and about her 2nd marriage and her first divorce  and how her second marriage wasn’t working out and how she had a crush on one of our teachers and wanted to date him. \nAnyways fast forward to the first inappropriate event I witnessed , my best friend at the time had a crush on a guy in the class and really wanted to date him to the point it made her severely depressed . I remember during the class breaks I told my teacher how sad she was (forgive me I was really young like 11) and when the school day was over she told the guy she likes to stay after class and told my friend to stay while the rest of us left the class to go home/buses. Few minutes go by while I’m waiting for the bus and she runs up to me and says they are dating now and the teacher told him to date her. ( he admits 9 years later he never wanted to date her but felt pressured by the teacher ). There was a time we had a pizza party and the class couples were kissing and being lovey dovey and sitting on each other and the teacher didn’t care. My best friend now boyfriend wasn’t affectionate with her at all. The teacher told him to be more affectionate with her and let her sit on him. Mind you were are 11-12 years old. She took his food and said I’ll give you these wings if you kiss her in front of everyone right now. He did and she gave him the food. \n\nShe was also very rude to me as a girl. She always yelled at me for no reason and when I would ask her and important question she would literally ignore me as I talk in her face. It became obvious to everyone that I didn’t like her and I always felt like what she was messed up. I always told my mom who implied she will get fired. She would tell us to shut up sometimes or make fun of the students. \n\nAnother incident while she was teaching class on the board her phone rang (text message) and she went to her desk to check the text and started crying and we assumed that she lost a family member/friend. She was bawling. At the end of the school day she told us her husband “wanted to talk”. Then she asked us what she should wear to meet him. \n\nShe got evaluated and during the evaluation she made fun of a student (which ultimately made her get fired).

As we were all changing, I realized the girls were in a room that you could see into if you were in the hall, and I was insanely curious to know what the big deal was between the girls and boys that they insisted on separating us. So I led the entire boys group to the room where the girls were changing, and pandemonium ensued. I can’t remember if it was worth it or not actually, but I do remember that the teaching staff was mortified. \n\nOf course only a few years later did I look back on that and realize why the teachers had that reaction. We were young enough that the whole thing was promptly buried no parents were called—they really didn’t know how to handle an entire male population of a class revolting against changing rules. We did get an extremely scary and foreboding talk about how if we were older there would have been some very bad repercussions for what we did. I was given up as the tiny Pan himself and thoroughly interrogated on what would possess me to do such a thing. \n\nSome of the girls remembered that day and always held it against me, some of the girls remembered that day and found it cute and endearing. I could always tell who felt what way based on how their faces looked when I walked into a room before they could mask their emotions. But pretty much every girl I grew up with came away from that day with strong feelings about it one way or another.\n\nI have mixed feelings about it today, but for sure it was a very consequential event in the scope of my lifetime.",

In 9th grade he would say such things to the only Jewish person at our school, they’d both laugh and a lot of kids found it funny, I never did. When we reached senior year The German kid kept up with the same jokes but people started to find it way less funny and a lot more “if I was not at risk of being arrested we’d take turns beating you to the ground.” (The previous summer we had read “Night” by Elie Weisel.) I had always wondered why he was like this and what joy he got out of it. Then one day I saw him in the parking lot with his Mother. She was strictly speaking German with a tone that sounded like scolding,and fixing his shirt, almost man handling him. He looked absolutely embarrassed and miserable. I don’t know how it promoted anti Semitic behavior from him, but I think it was ultimately about the power dynamic he experienced at home. Perhaps constantly spewing these hateful things and pushing this idea he believed he was better than us made him feel like he wasn’t as powerless as his mother made him feel.",

It was never horrible, never anything like physical bullying, and there were usually a couple other students around that would be like, \"ok, that's enough\" before it got super bad...anyway, all that to set up the part that actually fits the question:\n\nEvery year as a fundraiser (probably for some dumb senior trip), they would have the \"Senior Slave Day\".  Basically all of the underclassmen got paraded one by one on the stage in the auditorium, and the other students could bid on them to be their slave (yes, their language, not mine) for the day on a certain date later in the week.  It was supposed to be just carry their books, wait in the lunch line while they got to sit, I think the limit was supposed to be like washing someone's car which one person did a while back.  \n\nAs mentioned, I was highly popular because of being unpopular, I got the highest bid by far.  My \"service\" was them taking me into the restroom at lunch break and covering my face in makeup and I think they gave me some form of \"feminine\" clothing like an apron to out over my clothes or something.  Then they got a piece of yarn and used it as a leash and paraded me from our building to the cafeteria building via the sidewalk closest to the street.  \n\nI was just like whatever and went and tried to wash everything off instead of going to my last class, and the guidance counselor called my mom to let her know why I might be upset after school (not an apology, or putting a stop to it mind you, bit just letting her know because I was \"sensitive\" compared to the other students).

Kind of ruined their marriages and they were ridiculed a lot for that. \n\nBut come on, if you’re teaching a bunch of horny teenagers about safe sex/sex Ed, don’t tell them they aren’t very likely to get pregnant if they have sex.",

She was a nasty woman but i don't blae her after how others treated her.

She gave me detention for not working all class and disrupting the class.\n\nAnd lastly, my own bullying. Obviously i never found this funny, but i had my face slammed into a wall, chairs thrown at me, scissors, heavy books, awful things said about me and my family, mocked repeatedly, and i even was nearly stabbed.

Some students, teachers, and parents preferred our previous principal who let people do whatever, like a VP and a guidance counselor host parties for high school students with alcohol, and resigned over a sex scandal with an assistant. So, my dad has to come in and clean up this mess off a school, with a very loud minority that would oppose everything he did, to the point of spreading rumors like he was banning blue jeans and this got spread around enough the superintendent got involved. A group of teachers banded together and decided they were going to drive my dad out of the school, and students would either straight up blame me for stuff my dad did, like I'm somehow the boss of him, or try to cozy up to me like Littlefinger from game of thrones. This is a man who was a principal for 20 years and raised my lower graded schools to higher grades and has to deal with all sorts of bullshit from students, parents, and teachers. My school was the worst he ever had, and after the superintendent refused to back him up and left him high and dry, and he decided to retire early after my senior year ended. He has nightmares about his time there and had to start taking antidepressants and see a psychiatrist.\n\nThere's this idea that a principal is the king of the school. They're more like lower-middle management who have to answer to several bosses and office politics become real politics fast with the school board and superintendent being elected positions, who also in that county can and have voted to raise their own salaries and lower educator salaries to the point my mom and dad lost 20k each over 20 years and ended with us foreclosing on our house after I graduated. \n\nDon't be scumbag in school.",

So here’s a list of shit things I’ve done in that timespan:\n\n1) harass girls back in middle school by following them and touching them on the shoulders.\n\n2) would punch guys in the dick+balls in middle school. One time I did it so hard to someone Ik that I nearly got suspended over it and the dude was in pain for like an hour. \n\n3) I would pants people when playing basketball in late middle school to early high school out in public parks and I found it amusing and funny. \n\n4) I thought it was funny yanking chairs away from people when they tried to sit down only to fall on their ass on the floor (high school). Nearly got suspended in high school cause of this.\n\n5) I used to be racist asf (like touching a black guy’s hand would get me dirty kind of racist). So in freshman year of high school I would call this kid slave and shit and I thought it was hilarious asf. I stopped after half a year of this when he told me to cut it out. We did eventually become good friends after that tho!\n\nSo as you can see, I was a total piece of shit back then. What saved me was this philosophy class I took in highschool halfway thru my highschool years. That class made me turn from the close minded asshole I was to this open minded dude I am today. If I could go back in time, I would pummel my middle to early highschool self for the piece of shit things I did. Its wild how much of a 180 I did as a person cause my friends from college couldn’t believe most of the shit I listed above. Now I get repulsed at racist people, will actively help girls being harassed, and I refuse to make even a fist unless it’s for protecting my friends and fam from harassers or bullies. Can’t believe how much of a shitter I was back then and I’m glad that one class in high school changed my life and made me into a MUCH better person today.",

Obviously my favorite class and only class EVER that I sat on the front lol\nOne day she comes in with some bruise on her lower neck shoulder region and suddenly every boy in school was talking all about how it was a hickey. I didn't even know about this or noticed till the end of the day when our main teacher called all the boys into his class to reprimand all of us for making fun of her and the supposed hickey. \nApparently she ended up finding out and left class in tears after all the mocking.

It was during that time or school generation where one idiot fucking up would get the whole class or group in trouble because he was too much of a coward to say it was them. I didn't even know about it till they called us in to reprimand all of us boys and figure out who did it. I guess it started out as a funny joke that turned into a big rumor that got big enough that the teachers found out. \n\nTbh it shattered me too at the thought that even kids could be so cruel and immature even for that, apart from having a crush on her or liking her for being my favorite teacher.\n It just sucked seeing her face wet from all the tears trying to keep appearing okay after the breakdown. \nWe all apologized regardless and told her how much we loved her as a teacher and wanted her to stay, even us that had nothing to do with it she appreciated it and told us we were good boys and left for the day.

I don't think it was even a hickey could've been anything we were 6th grade boys we only ever heard about hickeys from tv didn't even know what one looked like.

Names have been changed to protect the innocent. \n\nThis was in high school in the late-1990s and was pre-Columbine. My group of friends consisted of six guys and myself. In the group, there were always two guys, Dusty and Tim, that got the butt of pretty much any practical joke. Everyone liked them, everyone just liked messing with them.\r  \n\r  \nWell, one day after school Dusty was walking to his car and as he was walking across the parking lot, a white van pulls of next to him and two guys in ski masks get out and put a gun to his head. They then put a sack over his head and push him into the van as another guy slides open then door. The van then screams out of the parking lot.\r  \n\r  \nInside the van, Dusty was hog tied with bungie cords while still forced to keep the bag over his head. The next thing he knew the van lurched to a stop and two guys carried him out of it and into a building. They then carried him downstairs.\r  \n\r  \nOnce he was downstairs, the masked men took the sack off his head and told him to strip. Dusty could see he was in an old basement but nothing looked familiar. When Dusty refused to strip, three men approached him and forcibly started removing his clothes. Dusty was pinned to the floor by his shoulders as guys yanked off his jeans and then his underwear. At this point, Dusty kicked out and caught one of the guys square in the faced and he could see blood start to gush out from under the ski mask as the guy started cussing.\r  \n\r  \nOnce the masked guy started to swear and grab at his nose through the mask, Dusty realized that the guy he kicked was our friend James. At this point, the masked guys knew he had made them and so they all took off their masks and it was all of our group of friends minus myself and one other guy. Dusty had broken James' nose and James deserved it. At that point, Dusty thought the prank was over but he was wrong.\r  \n\r  \nNow that he was naked, they smeared his body in Vaseline and then wrapped him from shoulder to toe in Saran Wrap. His \"friends\" then hung him upside down from an exposed rafter in the basement and took pictures of him.\r  \n\r  \nAfter they had done this, they let Dusty go and told him that if he ever ratted on them, they would print out the pics and put them up all over school.\r  \n\r  \nDustin never said a word about this to anyone until he told me about what the other guys did to him almost twenty years later. I then asked the guy that got his nose broke if that was true and he admitted they had kidnapped dusty and he still had the pictures. He also let me know the gun was a real .22 and it was loaded when they took Dusty hostage. I asked him why they had to use a real and loaded gun to do that and he said that it wasn't scary if the gun wasn't loaded.\r  \n\r  \nIt turns out, they did this to my other friend Tim as well but instead of hanging him naked from a basement rafter, they stripped him and made him bob for apples in the toilet of the abandoned house with the basement. They took pics of him too.\r  \n\r  \nTim did tell on the group and all of my friends but me were suspended. They also put the pics of him bobbing for apples up everywhere when they came back to school.\r  \n\r  \nI knew that Tim had been kidnapped because I found out when everyone got suspended. I didn't know about Dusty until years later. I was never asked to participate in the kidnappings because everyone knew I wouldn't go along with it so they didn't bother.\r  \n\r  \nTLDR: Late 90s highschool friends kidnapped a couple of other friends at gunpoint and made them do embarrassing stuff as a joke.",

I think his in-class persona was used to protect himself.

He was pretty talented, and it was very obviously our teacher just railing his two cats and a dog all over the house, after which the pets would shit everywhere. He had another friend write dialogue and used the school's free copier to distribute it around the school. Almost everyone thought it was hilarious, and even some of the kids who didn't still thought Biology teacher deserved it.\n\nEventually a different teacher got a hold of the 5th or 6th installment of the series and brought it to the rest of the faculty's attention.

I sit down in my health class on day one, look around, and I see the THAT kid. I never said anything to him, just noticed that \"hey, there's that kid from elementary school.\" I hardly even thought about how we would tease him back then.\n\nFast forward to a little later in the semester and we're talking about abuse and trauma in health class (or something along those lines). I guess at some point the floor was opened up for people to talk, and THAT kid raises his hand and proceeds to explain how he was horribly abused--physically and emotionally--by his mother as a child. It hit me in the moment for sure, but over the years it just gets heavier and heavier on me that this poor kid was being tormented at school on TOP of suffering horrible abuse at home. And he was being tormented by all of use for NO REASON. He was just a small little kid and for that we decided he needed to suffer.\n\nI never want to forget that because I am absolutely going to tell my own son that story, because I sure as shit will not tolerate my son turning into the kind of bully that I was in elementary school.",

And prior to the tests she dictated the whole list of questions she was going to ask. So for those of us who had bought the book, the class was extremely boring.\n\nAlso, the teacher usually forgot what part of the book she was dictating, and she just asked one of the students where were we on the book, and they usually told her we were several chapters behind, so the dictation was almost always an old chapter. A snoozefest. In that environment, it was likely that at some point some people would want to prank the teacher.\n\nAs I said, she walked very slowly, and her step wasn't very firm.

We're not moving\".\n\nThe teacher suddenly got up and told the class \"Sorry, children, I'm not feeling well, I'm going home\".\n\nAt the time I thought it was funny, today I think the poor woman got seriously worried about her health.",

She wore nothing but tacky looking jumpers, one of which she seemed to have written \"count your blessings\" across the chest in sharpie. She had the gnarliest, most jagged teeth I've ever seen in my life. Like, it looked like some of her teeth were just sideways in her mouth, and others looked like roughly carved arrow heads. Her hair always looked super greasy and she wore it in a long, extremely tight ponytail. She brought her lunch in what looked like a small, decorated paint canister. And she apparently quacked. Like a duck. I personally don't remember her ever quacking, but every other student who had her swore that she quacked.\n\nCombine all those traits with the fact that she was fairly strict and was the type of teacher that would punish the whole class when like 3 people are misbehaving, my class picked on her relentlessly. I don't remember any specific examples other than the one thing I was personally involved in, but our class definitely drove her to tears. The one thing I did, is one day I drew a picture of her, a sort of unflattering middle school level caricature, and showed my friends. That's where I intended to leave it but one of my friends ended up taking it, folding it up, and slipping it under the door to her classroom. I don't know if she ever actually picked it up and saw it, but if she did she never bothered pursuing the matter.\n\nBack then, I kinda had the idea that my fellow students' behavior was wrong (which is why i never directly participated) but at the same time I hated that teacher for the collective punishment so I was more on the class's side than hers. The only time I remember trying to stop anyone from acting up in class was one time when we had lost recess or something for the nth time in a row, i blew up at my friends and cussed them out, not because \"making life a living hell for a woman who clearly has enough problems going on in her life is wrong\", but closer to \"why are you shooting yourself in the foot, you know how she'll punish us for what behavior, stop doing that thing and she'll stop taking stuff away from us\".",

I was sitting at lunch with some of the “cool” soon-to-be seniors who were talking about parties and hooking up with girls. One story included one of the players, Ben, and another buddy of theirs, let’s call him Pat, who really liked this one girl we all knew. Ben, who was an honor student, lettered in all the major sports at least two years each, funny as hell and pretty nice to most people, said he helped Pat hook up with the girl he liked. Ben said they were all drinking and he got the girl to come into a bedroom with him to hook up. What she didn’t know is Pat was already in the room hiding under the bed naked. Ben and the girl were making out and he pretended to roll off the bed. Pat then jumped on the bed and “got on her” (which was the term we used for hooking up back then). The “funny” part was that Ben was fully clothed when he fell off the bed and Pat jumped on bed naked. Everyone laughed and another guy asked how the girl didn’t know they switched on her. Ben laughed and said, “she didn’t care.” I remember being uncomfortable with the situation, it’s obviously horrible, but laughed with the guys anyway. I wasn’t really part of the “in crowd” and was too scared to call it out at the time. This all came roaring back into my mind when the Kavanaugh hearings were going on and I absolutely believe his was a similar situation. I’m sure both of those girls were frightened as hell.",

            "text": "Long one - Had an algebra teacher first year of high school named Avila. He was a real condescending prick who would berate you in class and call you out if you didn't understand. Avila, as a form of motivation, had the class sit in order of your cumulative score on his tests and homework. Closest to the door meant you were doing well while further row from door and last chair was the worst grade. I had moved from a 'south of a freeway' school where minorities outnumbered whites to a school where that was flipped. Old school wasn't up to speed so I had a lot of questions. Started the year and did well, making it all the way to the first seat, first row by the door. After the winter break I start having trouble with the more advanced topics and had more questions. Mr. Avila starting riding me, saying maybe I should back down south and start over, laughing at my questions and saying he couldn't believe I asked something that silly. My grades fell and I was about middle row in March, middle of the class when I got tired of his shit. After he berated me for asking him to go over an equation again so I said if he was a better teacher he wouldn't be upset if a student asked for help. Mr. Avila told everyone to stand and move their desk cause he was moving me to the back. I said no when he told me to move and he grabbed the desk and pulled me to the last spot, last row - place 30. He had this grin on his face when he did it that I can still remember. Jump forward a month and I'm doing my time. Finish my work, take my tests but never ask another question or raise my hand. I never moved from the last spot and didn't really care too much. One day the school had a blood drive and Mr. Avila gave blood. Rumors were running thru the school that he had fainted in the morning and he didn't look well for the last class of the day. Lo and behold we have a test that day. Hot late April in the southwest in a class in the 1970s there no AC or windows for cross ventilation. Mr. Avila showed up late to class and looked pale and out of it. He passed out the test and sat in his desk drinking a soda one of the students went to buy him. Several teachers came by to check on him and he said he was okay, last class of the day and he'd make it thru. About 15 minutes before end of the day he gets up and walks around, checking on student progress. He had offered to give us a few extra minutes to finish up after the bell rang so we weren't too rushed. Mr. Avila walks passed my desk and sits in the vacant row of unused desks, last seat a little behind me. He's quiet, sitting with his head in his hands then slowly slips out of the seat and onto floor, cutting his head on the edge of the under-seat rack for books. He didn't make a sound doing so but I watched him all the way to the floor. We made eye contact and I turned back to my test and finished up. I let him lay there and bleed while I finished the test. When the bell rang I got my stuff and placed my test on his desk and left. Next day we had a substitute and it was a few days before Mr. Avila came back. I was asked why I didn't let anyone know he had fainted and got crap from some of the teachers and students. I said he was sitting in the desk giving me that stupid smile when I left so who was I supposed to tell? He never looked me in the eye, never said anything to me, and didn't take it out on my grade. Me and some of my friends laughed about it and even made fun of him in the hallways the following year. My mother, who was a principal at another school, had a stroke some years later making me realize what I did was messed up.",

Tame compared to that)\n\n- Vandalism/Tempering with others' possessions. Kids would constantly run across tables during recess, with their arms opened, pushing every object possible off them. This happened to me way more than once. They'd even scribble on my drawings and toss my bag across the classroom if they felt like sitting at my seat without my consent. \nAt the end of eight grade I remember even seeing a couple of guys destroying chairs as well (going as far as breaking the metal legs).\n- Spanking. Girls would get spanked CONSTANTLY by the guys, hell girls would even spank each other. Pretty sure guys spanked each other as well since humping was also a huge \"joke\" at the beginning of my middle school years.\nBefore you ask: yes I was also spanked, and no, I did not react to it very well (was already sexually assaulted by a friend when I was 10, that shit angered me and made me feel violated).\n- Making extremely perverted comments towards other students.\n- Two kids were once taking pictures of girls' asses behind their back. If anyone asks: as far as I am aware? School did Jack shit about it; probably just suspended them for like a week, maybe even just a day.\n\n\n\nBonus highschool story\n\n> Small context before I start: I love drawing, and would often bring my sketchbooks along with me to draw during class (I was heavily bullied at the time). \n\nA couple kids were working on a film in my homeroom class once. I think we either had PE or a lesson off? So we all went outside. Usually when I headed out for recess to have walks I would leave my stuff on the table so I can keep going from where I left off, so I innocently left my sketchbooks on my table, as per usual.\nLesson ends. I walk back in. Sketchbooks are completely destroyed and torn apart. Apparently, they were working on a scene where the students were supposed to throw objects around the room, and decided to use my personal belongings as props. Of course, as one would expect, I was angry crying.\n\nFor anyone wondering: the kid who did it eventually came over to apologize.... Except he didn't actually feel sorry; dude came over snickering like hell and smiling, clearly finding the situation funny, then handed me a diary to make up for it.

The kid I was helping was gregarious and was friends with a girl who would bully me. There was a game going around school I dont remember exactly called zap and if you did something you had to ask the person out whose name was written on your hand. I never really thought anyone would find me attractive because I was bullied growing up, so each time he asked me out I rejected him. Well in that class, he started to feel me up during lessons at which I would swat his hand or scoot away from him. After a few days of this I told the teacher and asked him to move me. His response was that I was \"too ugly\" for anyone to want me like that (I was chubby). The people nearby who heard thought it was funny I was just upset and embarrassed. I didn't think to tell the administration about it but I should have.\n\nIn 9th grade, I met a guy and we were getting along great and I thought of him as a friend and he also got along with my other guy friend, who I will name S, as we shared a table in 6th period chemistry class. After a few weeks, I'm in Drama Club right after school and we were working on casting, well at one point S comes over to me and asked me if it's true and I'm just confused so I just say something like \"what do you mean\" and he proceeds to tell me that the other guy had been telling people he took my v-card (mind you apparently I wasn't the only one he said this about) and of course I told him no. Well a few days later his friend group asks me if it was true, mind you I am pretty spiteful so I said \"oh, is that what that was because I didn't feel a thing\"? Which is 100% correct as he never did take my v-card so I literally felt nothing, my intent was to insinuate he wasn't gifted in the jewels department though so he would have to tell the truth ot love with his friends thinking he has a small... well you know.

When it came to our classes to tell, same thing. Just laughter at her. After that day was done the next day she didnt come in. We all just thought oh no problem she just sick. We find out she was absent all week. And then hear she left the school. She was tired of it all. And Quit.

So one day he and another friend of his decides to bring a hamster, pet's are strictly prohibited but they didn't give a flying fuck and brought it anyway.\n\nSo he has the hamster in a plastic case on top of his desk and decides to pay attention to his hamster instead of the teacher, playing with it. The teacher notices and walks up to him, she picks up the hamster and saw he was asleep, she just looked at it and pet him. Gave him his hamster back and was chill about it. But apparently to the class clown thought she was to agressive with his hamster and decides to start screaming to the teacher about it. \n\nThey start arguing and he tells the teacher \" I'll do that to you're kids while they sleep and see how you like it\" the teacher had 2 girls 1 of them was 6 and the other one was 8. The teacher left the classroom immediately and went to the principals office, everybody was laughing at the whole thing like wtf just happened and why the hell you have a hamster in class. The teacher comes back crying and tells him to go with her. They come back about 30 minutes later, he picks up his stuff and leaves, everybody was in shock not knowing what was going on. After 2 weeks of not going to school,  he comes back and tells us what happened. Basically he got a 2 week suspension with this being his final warning and if gets another warning he is expelled.\nHis parents ended up taking him to another school because of his horrible behavior ( he has done a shit ton of other things which are just crazy, if anyone wants to hear another story of him just ask me ).\n\nAfter about 2 months later me and some of my friends we're talking with my teacher after class and the subject comes up about this incident. And she ends up telling us the story about why she got so emotional that day, and the reason was because a couple months ago she was being abused by her ex boyfriend and he was abusing of her and her 2 daughters, and after weeks of trying to get legal justice, they finally got him incarcerated. She got pretty traumatized by the whole experience, so when the class clown said \" I'll do that to you're kids while they sleep and see how you like it\" that hit home to her PTSD. \n\nSorry for the long ass story but wanted to share with you guys.",

I said to everyone to knock it off and that was the last it was ever acknowledged. \n\nTeachers, bus driver, adults just kind of turned a blind eye. I confided in the school nurse who was the same nurse when my dad was there. God bless her. She was the only adult I felt I could let in, but even she didn’t know how messed up the situation was. It was so surreal back then. My family didn’t have a clue. I don’t know what his family knew and I’m not sure how he faced them. I ended up moving away and finishing school somewhere else because my father was moving. He asked if I wanted to come. \n\nDad never knew I chose to go not because I wanted to be with him, but because I needed to get the fuck away from this weirdo. I didn’t want the small town to constantly talk about me, laugh at us, and dismiss or excuse that fucked up shit without ever offering to help either of us.",

I was like what’s this, and he laughed and said GHB. I was like “that’s date rape isn’t it”, and he says yeah , but it hits dudes differently. My friend Todd comes up during the conversation and I was like , mmmmm I’m not so sure I want to drink this, so he goes “give it to Todd” . So I hand my beer to Todd explaining to him what was in it and he just takes off laughing with the beer. It turns out he gave it to my other friend Chris. I only found out later in the Night when I saw a couple people carrying his limp body down a hillside so that he could pass out in his truck. \nYears later a couple of friends said that Nick had dosed a girl at another party out in Nevada and basically took advantage of her and left her in the dirt. I don’t know if that actually happened or not But I do know  Nicks younger brother eventually came out and said that his brother had molested him clean up to the age 19. It’s crazy.

My friend group at the time decided to throw a big party one weekend, and ended up inviting her to get to know her a little better and see what she was like. To make a long story short, she blacked out pretty severely and went into the woods and ended up somehow pooping her pants/getting vomit all over herself. The guys I had gone to the party with and I had all unknowingly left while this was taking place, but the girls that were still there ended up cleaning her up and got in touch with her mom so she could come get her. Anyways, she was fine, but it only took one day at school for everybody to find out this had happened. One of my friends at the time came up with the self-explanatory nick name of “poopy pants”, and it spread like wildfire within ONE lunch period, and let me just say it stuck like glue. Obviously at the time this was insanely hilarious to just about every guy at the school, and even a handful of girls. Not joking, it was the talk of the school for probably a month. To add insult to injury, it was discovered that she had eaten chipotle that day, and one of my crazier, less tame friends went back to the party house and ended up finding the culprit poop and for whatever reason decided to get a picture and send that around. I remember there was one day everybody was debating about the amount of pieces of visible corn in the poo Lol. Looking back on it now, in a more sympathetic way, I feel insanely bad about the whole situation. I actually ended up apologizing for the jokes my friends had made about her a few years after high school had ended. Although I’m sure that didn’t make up for anything that had happened, I felt the need to express my sympathy for her. I know for a fact she’s doing good now, but really getting introspective on it, I’m sure when that situation was happening it was pretty detrimental for her mental health and I’m glad she didn’t do anything rash at the time. I can’t even imagine having to walk the halls in high school, which was bad enough as is, and have to hear people whisper behind me calling me poopy pants literally everyday.",

Shy girl with broken german but no language problem due to english and her abillity to learn languages quite well.\nOver all cool girl i enjoyed anime and nightcore during thst time and she was the only that could relate. Lived in the same village so my friends her and myself often sat together during bus rides.\n\nShe was beautiful and all a man could wish for, a tall girl with long legs beautiful blue eyes and nice long blonde hair. I was more interested in video games though so she was just a friend and probably i wasnt her type anyways. (Puberty hit me hard with late 16 so i still looked a lot like a child with 14. Which is normal but there were guys in my class. Dam boy)\n\nAnyways moving forward overtime the whole class accepted her and nobody hated her or something. And apperently due to her moving so far and finally finding friends made her feel to comfortable.\n\nShe got together with one guy while still maintaining a cool friendship with everyone else. What i didnt think back then was at one point many guys cornered around her in the door frame. Everyone was laughing including her so i didnt think anything of it at that time.\nI later learned my classmates were touching her inapproriately. I noticed after that that she began to cut herself, she often had bandages around her arms. I knew nothing of that sort of thing. I just remained my normal dorky self. \nShe began to get back to her shy self, cutting the closure. Thats when the guy she used to be together with, then ex, began to send others one nude picture of her. I saw it once, black white image of her in basic. underwear. I still hate myself for even seeing it. \nShe didnt sit with us in the bus anymore, though the friends and me didnt do anything, probably thats why.\n\nShe started skipping classes. Once a wek, twice a week.  3 months after that groping incident she left the class. The teacher said that the family had to go back to their country since their father was only working here temporarily.\n\nShe used to say that she had no friends st home and that she was happy to have us. I have a scar from her from a day we went to the beach. I got a sunburn and she never saw one, asked me if she can punch me there. Her fingernail sliced through my arm. A hillsrious memory.\n\nI havent thought about that girl in 7 years. It is weird to think about back then. I hope she is doing well. I hope that many things in her life changed for the better.\n\nBe careful with who you share intimite photos, teach your kids well to not do that until they are able to properly decide that for themselves.

Well she’s still black, I’m sure, but she moved away, hence the term “was”.\n\nOne day we had a substitute teacher, who was a black man. Someone in our classroom of 7 year olds started giggling, and the giggling turned into a contagious laughter. I had no idea why I was laughing, but everyone’s laughter made me want to laugh too. This continued on for a solid 10 minutes until the sun brought the principal in to calm us down. \n\nIt wasn’t until a few years later that I realized hat the kid who sparked the hysteria had done so because the substitute was black. I still carry some shame over that incident. Yeah, I was only 7, and I had no idea what I was laughing about, but I still put myself in that man’s shoes and think of how humiliating and frustrating that must have been. \n\nIf you ever substituted for Miss Z’s class in 1989 (in Michigan), I’m so, so sorry.

He was a super nice guy and genuinely a good educator, but everyone in my class would either ignore/refuse to participate in his lectures or straight up mock his stutter when answering questions. Some kids would even raise their hands to answer then ignore his question and ask him an unrelated question about his stutter. They made fun of him relentlessly, even though my class was made up mostly of the ‘straight A, upstanding citizen, wealthy CCD kids’. \n\nI personally was never one to really participate in my classes before then, but I raised my hand to every single one of his questions just to keep the lesson moving and save him from being messed with. After his semester ended, I stalked his twitter account and he constantly tweeted things out like, “Not excited to go back to these high school students” and “Have you ever felt the urge to hit a child, but you need to keep your job”.

The fire department found Jakob's name scrawled across the dumpster and they told the principal who had Jakob's family pay for the new dumpster and had him suspended. Jakob never returned to school and we all assumed it was because his family didn't agree with the school's actions or something similar. I met back up with Jakob ten or so years later in a neighboring town where he was working at a small shop, I asked how he had been doing and he gave me his side of what had happened. His family had been extremely poor since his father had lost his job and his mother was making less than minimum wage doing odd jobs and babysitting gigs around town. The dumpster ended up costing around 500$ to replace and this occurred right after they had had to pay rent, the school said that if they didn't pay they would have to force Jakob over to the police, now Jakob up until then had a spotless record and was their families pride and joy so instead of sending him to prison, they sold their small one-bedroom house, (From what I remember Jakob slept on the couch) and moved to the neighboring city and back in with their father's parents.",

Not only that, he was the class nerd, so naturally he was the subject of a lot of bullying. Yet oddly enough, my classmates and I kept off him and treated him like we always did throughout advancing through middle school. \n\nDuring the last year of middle school, just before we’d graduate and move on to what would be the danish equivalent of high school, things changed. My class was put together with another and the whole class dynamics was thrown into chaos. \n\nCliques formed and I found myself hanging out with said classmate more. I was becoming a nerd too. But I had gone through my puberty and I desperately wanted to fit in everywhere and impress the girls. So I bounced around a lot, without knowing what I was doing. \n\nIt didn’t take me long to start hanging out with the wrong crowd(s) and I saw that every damn crowd was horrid to my classmate. I followed along with the antics, though and I, on several occasions, coerced him into our bullying. Some times it was small things, like we’d let him hang out too, but we’d make fun of him. Him, being awkward and, well; socially inept at following along with the more mature of us, was taking it in strides. He kept returning for more bullying, beatings and disgraceful behavior because, I think, he didn’t know that this sort of interaction was toxic and absolutely wrong. \n\nIt finally topped one day nearing the end of our final year. We had a lot of classes off after we finished the individual finals so we hung out in a lounge / common room at school. \n\nOne day a mate came in with 10 giant rolls of duct tape that he’d swiped from his dads workplace and we quickly set out to spend it all on the most obscene and childish shit we could find. In comes in the scrawny kid I’ve been telling about; with a bit shit eating grin on his face he shared that he’d just gotten his 5th top grade in his finals. He was always good at getting great grades so it shouldn’t have come as a surprise to us. \n\nBut this is where it got so bizarre that I think my memory is obscuring somewhat that truly went down. But I do remember that everyone in the lounge, girls and boys; every different group, cheered for him! We went WILD! We pushed him around, threw him up while howling like madmen. We declared him our King! We put him in a four-legged chair, lifted him onto a table and then we duct taped him firmly into the chair. \n\nHe was beaming and laughing with us, unaware that we were making it thoroughly impossible for him to escape the chair on his own. Some brought him soda and candy and waitered on him, for a king shouldn’t have to lift a finger on his own. \n\nNow this is where it gets truly fuzzy for me. I know I took part in taping him to the chair… but what I remember next is just pieces:\n\nSeeing him, hung upside down in the chair, taped firmly to a pillar in the hallway. \n\nParamedics and teachers working frantically to tear him down as he was shaking violently but absently in the duct tape harness. \n\nHim having such bloodshot eyes and a face so red that I thought he’d never return to his pale old self. \n\nThe entire class getting the sternest ever talk ever. I don’t remember what was said, but I do remember how it made me feel then; absolutely embarrassed and terrible.\n\nA few days later the class year was over and school ended. I’ve never seen or heard from him since. \n\nLooking back now I’m absolutely mortified over my behavior then. I got no excuses and I’ll probably never get a chance to apologize - but even if I do, I don’t deserve forgiveness. \n\nNo one should have to undergo bullying like that.",

The word is a slang adoption of the Japanese word for enema (浣腸, kanchō).[5] In accordance with widespread practice, the word is generally written in katakana when used in its slang sense, and in kanji when used for enemas in the medical sense.\n\nIn English-speaking countries, the prank is known as goosing.[3]",

During middle school he was well behaved and stayed out of Trouble but somehow always was in a scheme that ended up getting other people in trouble. \n\nOne day he went to a club I was in out of the blue. We messed around then he told me why he was there. He asked to the teacher to go to the bathroom. During today they girls were playing volleyball in the gym after school it’s a club we had offered at are school. So this would mean that he could get into the girl’s locker room. A boys dream at the time. \n\nI guess from what he told me is that he set a camera up there. I don’t know how or why but I really didn’t  push him on the subject. \nAfter a day or two he ended up getting the cam back. It has died so I don’t think he had gotten any videos. I don’t know where he was able to hide it but it was a small camera.  \n\n\nTLDR: my friend has went into the girls locker room and tried to get a video of them undressing but the footage corrupted.",

There was also a massive pile of shit on the ground right next to the toilet.

Daniel (who was and probably still is a complete asshole) and his friends decided that the best course of action would be to carry her out into the front yard and lay her down in the grass half naked for everyone to see. Before Andreas friends could wake her up and get her pants pulled back up Daniel went back into the bathroom and gather up the little rug around the toilet (like you might see in an old lady's house or something) that the pile of shit had landed on, carried it out to the front yard, and very gingerly flicked the rug which sent the whole intact pile of shit soaring through the air and landing right on Andreas face, where it just stayed. Eventually her friends got her gathered up and left, but the damage was already done. She showed up to school the next day to a chorus of kids chanting *\"shit face Andrea\".* that was the last time any of us ever saw her. Idk if she moved out of town or transferred schools or what, but she just ghosted everyone.

He was an old man with a diabetic tremor who spoke fondly of his wife and just seemed like he wanted to make it through the year.\n\nAfter a few months he was gone and we had a long-term sub. We all assumed he had been let go for being incompetent at teaching statistics. I later found out that one of the girls in our class had reported him to the principal for having a porn site up on his work computer during class.\n\nWhile that may have been true, I sure never noticed and neither did anyone else in the class beside the girl who reported it. For context, she was notoriously unreliable and was known to talk crap about/sabotage her \"friends\" who had higher GPAs than her, because she thought that anything that threatened her top-10 (or salutatorian) status had to be eliminated immediately. You'd think she was trying to go Ivy. Anyway, stats put *everyone's* GPA in a bit of jeopardy with that teacher. She may have been telling the truth, but in context we were all fairly certain she was carrying out her own form of vigilante justice. If so, poor guy. He was clearly still teaching because he needed the money.",

My parents are freaking out, he was supposed to be home a while ago”. \n\nI just said “They told me he was going home after they dropped me off, that was like 40 minutes ago. Is everything okay?”. She then hanged up on me. Didn’t see Alex for a week at school come Monday.  \n\nWeek later he shows up and walks up to me and says “Yo… I uh.. You were totally right about that parking lot, man. We were drinking, smoking joints and in 2 minutes the cops rolled up and made us call our parents.

To emphasize this, he had had a previous student donate a klan robe that allegedly belonged to their grandfather, the family was ashamed but they thought it might be a good tool that the teacher could use to show how fucked up and pervasive racism was in our county, and how accepted it was that the robes former owner had been prominent in area politics and was known for his affiliations.  The teacher brought it in and showed the robe off for his lesson and a group of preppy/athletic guys took this to mean he agreed with their views, and wrote a rap to express their appreciation that the teacher shows respect to the klan and racial superiority (the irony was lost on them that they culturally appropriated a Black art form to express their thoughts). The teacher came in the next day after they had slipped the lyric sheet to him, I can’t remember if they slid it under his door, put it on his desk, or in his faculty mailbox, and he blew up on everyone and ended up donating the robe to a local museum and made sure to reiterate in no way does he tolerate racism and that he was disgusted and ashamed to think that anyone could misconstrue his lesson. His teaching style drastically changed after that and it was pretty much from the book, take notes, teach to the test after that.

Most of the group was not nearly mature enough to handle some of the very serious topics we were discussing, such as patients being treated on-site for sex addiction, drugs, psychotic breaks with violent episodes. I remember guys snickering and bumping elbows while listening to the treatment history of a man with multiple charges pending for child porn distribution and severe agoraphobia that would trigger his sex addiction. \n\nWe walked through patient's rooms WHILE THEY WERE IN THERE like it was a zoo enclosure. Talking about how long they'd been there and why. Kids would try to open their closets and look under their beds. It was disgusting. I talked to the school board after the trip that I felt disgusted with myself after the trip and thought it should be taken off the syllabus as a mandatory experience (make it optional, at least), and the school board told me \"boys would be boys\" and I needed to grow a better backbone to tune them out.

We’d all hang out often and play mean pranks on each other—random dead arms, hiding each other’s stuff, throwing each other into pools in the dead of winter. Idk there were always so many options. I was at this party and we were all drunk—I walked up to my friend Ryan who had already knocked out another one of my friends by hitting them in the back of the head with a log in the shedhouse (friends dad worked construction and had this huge two-story shed with random crap in it) and I poured my entire beer on top of his head.

Doesn’t compare to what this rando did.\n\nThe friend who was a girl was pretty drunk, not too drunk but enough to enjoy the tomfoolery. One of these outsider guys that all my friends thought were cool (I personally thought he was always a little creepy) was super over the top with some of the stunts he pulled. His voice always had to be the loudest in the group and he always had to one-up everyone.\n\nHe pushed the friend who’s a girl over in her lawn chair backwards and then proceeded to literally tea bag her. At my angle I don’t know what exactly happened but I saw him undo the front of his pants and heard mumbling from the girl. She struggled for a good couple seconds—everyone was laughing and all you saw were her legs flailing around in the air while she was under his giant body and he creepily whispered “Suck em, yeah get em both” in a very creepy way. I can’t remember if he stopped or she pushed him off or what but after the laughing was over we just continued on our nights but I glimpsed at her face from time to time and I could tell she was not right for the rest of the night.\n\nWe all crashed in my friends room later on, I slept curled over on a sofa chair without a blanket.

She was stuck in traffic from another morning accident, and not wanting to be late,  she turned a U in the middle of the road and was t-boned by oncoming traffic. 29 years old and left a kid or two behind. RIP and may you never make fun of death. The possibility is always out there.",

I went to a small school, and all the other schools around me were small as well, so we all knew the kids who went to other schools. \n\nThere was this one school in particular, that was slightly bigger than the rest and had better funding so it would often have foreign exchange students. \n\nThis one foreign exchange student was managing a female basketball team at that school. She wasn’t very popular there, but the girls pretended to like her. In between the locker rooms there were connected doors with no signs that led to the coach’s office/training room (where the athletic trainer would take care of injuries). After practice one day, the girls told her to go straight through the office into the next door to go get something, and she ended up in the boy’s locker room, where there were a bunch of guys getting ready for football or leaving football practice or a game. (Can’t remember which). Basically she saw a bunch of naked dudes and got in huge trouble for going in there. The girls team blamed her and told the administrators she did it herself to be funny. She was almost sent back to her home country. The family she stayed with ended up giving her up to another family in my town where she transferred over and went to school with us. She ended up making a lot of friends and even six years later is still in contact with many of us and even sometimes visits. \n\nWhen she told us the story she almost cried. I almost cried for her.

Then after she was done talking about dates and presents, she told us they would sneak into one of the more isolated bathrooms by the bus loop and kiss in the handicap stalls.

On the walk back we convinced each other and ourselves that she was talking about an older student  (we went to a K-5th grade school)that wore a yellow rain poncho she had a crush on and didn’t know his name, so she called him what she called him. The stuff with the bathroom we decided was from a grown up show she watched. I never saw my reading buddy after that recess and my friend and I never spoke of it again. I forgot about it.\n\nI ended up sharing a few classes with her brother who was the same age as me in middle school. He said something about her and it reminded me of the recess conversation. I said “haha is she still talking about that guy in the yellow coat?” He nonchalantly said “what? Yeah he used to come over sometimes. ”\n\nI froze. Didn’t know what to say. Ended up asking him if she was doing well and he said yes.

So, he intended on stealing the processors: even though the computers weren't really all that good, they still had really good Intel processors. He then proceeded on doing it, during a geography class while we were using the computers - the room didn't have any cameras, so he managed to do it on the back of the class, where the teacher couldn't see him. He opened them, picked up 2 processors (and then he wrapped them with toilet paper) and closed the cabinet, and, since he had such a good reputation in the school and none of his friends or teachers exactly knew what he was doing, nobody questioned it. Still, I am to this day haunted by the fact that he managed to get two processors from a private school's IT classroom and nobody even noticed it.",

When I was a 4th grade, there was a 2rd grader who would put a plastic bag over his head and make funny faces and noises like he was suffocating. He would do it on the bus, the first time he did it most kids laughed others just looked away. He did it every now and then. A few weeks later I remember hearing yelling a few seats behind me so I turned around in my seat. A 5th grader had punched him cause he used Saran/plastic wrap that was used to cover his gingerbread house on a classmate of his. The classmates an argument and both got upset\nThe 5th grader stated he heard them fighting. There were maybe 10 of us left so we’re kinda scattered through the bus. We would be a couple of the last ones to get dropped off back home. So he was checking on them every now and then to make sure they didn’t start hitting each other. The one kid turned to look out window to avoid more conflict. This made the other kid angry so grabbed the plastic wrap that was covering his house and put it across his face and pulled it as his used his knees to press on his back. This shocked us, the 5th grader had ran over yelling stop and had to punch him to get him to let go. I ran to the back cause the kid was enraged and kept trying to attack the other kid. I was a pretty big kid and had maybe 60lb to 80lbs on him and grabbed him from behind and set my weight on him on the seat across. holding him as the 5th grader held his legs. He was still kicking and cussing us out. The bus driver had stopped, called security and told the younger ones to get to the front. The kid he tried to suffocate was crying and shaking uncontrollably. The bus driver had had the 5th grader let go and had him take the kid to the front to calm him down. He had to use his belt to bound his legs, than swapped places with me and told me to wait upfront til the security and principal came. When they showed up the victim, 5th grader and myself had to stay to tell them what happen since cameras weren’t on the bus. Also to get medically checked cause he had scratched me and the other was kicked a couple times. The rest had been picked up in the school vans and taken home. CPS and a couple cops showed up and took those kids home. The 5th grader and myself got picked up by our parents. \nLast I know was CPS had taken the kid from his father for child abuse/neglect and heavy drug use, his mother was already in prison for drug use (Heroine) I think about it all the time, the kinda of terrible things his dad did to him. Honestly he wasn’t a bad kid, he would ask the older kids to help him with his homework or how to spell words he didn’t know. I think those times he would put a bag over his head was a cry for help or how they treated him. \nI wish him the best and hope he’s doing better, he deserved better.",

Apparently he would throw parties and invite kids (middle school/early highschool - he was in his mid 20's at this time, mind you) who wanted to seem cool and rebellious. He would give them drugs and get them addicted and then, when they couldn't pay him back (because they were CHILDREN), he forced them to have sex with each other or with him. They were addicted and needed the drugs, so they did whatever he wanted. One kid finally had the courage to tell someone, and you want to know how they got the perfect proof the kid wasn't lying? The creep CALLED the kid who went to the police while he was IN THE POLICE STATION asking for \"favors.\"\n\nI never went to parties or anything as a kid, and in highschool I hung out with the theater crowd.

We didn’t like him for some reason, he was just the typical cool guy. Well one day we decided to make a fake account of facebook and put some random pictures of a girl from the internet. So we decided to write this guy and he responded. Initially it was meant to be a short joke but we got quite carried away. We had been talking to him for a few days when we got the brilliant idea of inviting him out on a date to the cinema. Anyway, we then forgot about this and went shopping (the cinema is in the mall) on that very same day. While my friend and I were looking at clothes i get a text “where are you?” and more texts after that. I realized then that i had my number on my real facebook account and it was shown on the fake one too. So i get these texts and at firdt idk what its about but then i remember. Amyway we go up to the cinema and we see him waiting there. I think that’s when I realized it was super shitty what we did. Seeing him all dissapointed kinda broke my heart. Anyhow after that i deleted the account and we never did that again. And to this day i’m not sure anyone other than my friend knows about it.",

But Shamika was the tallest kid in the class and when she ran to the bathroo, her head connected with the paper towel dispenser mounted on the wall, almost everyone laughed but  her head immediately gushed blood, I was probably the only one who didn’t laugh but I did laugh later once the teacher came back and dealt with what happene, it was pretty messed up that everyone laughed at someone getting teased and then hurt pretty badly.\n\n when I was ten or eleven my best friend and I had an older friend that was a year or two older than us but younger than my olderbrother , he wanted to show us this cool game, in order to begin we had to stand with our backs to the wall, then he went in front of us and placed his hands to the side of our necks until we passed out.  We thought it was cool at the time because we had crushes on him but it was pretty messed up that he did that and he got pretty damn lucky everything turned out okay, I did later tell my brother but he just called me stupid and said to never do it again or he would tell our parents, he never explained why it was stupid but a few years later while searching internet articles I found something on the blackout game killing young people .. yeah, no wonder my brother called me stupid,but I didn’t know what he was going to do!",

The lady teaching was my previous teacher, and I was a really good student, so she accepted me to tutor the younger kids. She. was. awful. The class wasn't easy but she was really something else and she treated me like crap. Instead of just tutoring, she had me doing all the marking, even supposedly having to come up with lesson plans, while god knows what she did. She even made me type up her entire resume (which was in another language) and then berated me in front of everyone, when I didn't put all the little accents over the vowels (especially when there was no instruction to do so!). She missed a class one day, and I took the initiative to teach them (as an 11th grader) as best as i could, from the book. She came back the next day to berate me, again, because there was some stuff i didn't cover. WTF?!\n\nAnyway, the kids hated her and one kid got the master plan to put laxative in her coffee.  We tried it once, but it was still in solid form, so she threw out the coffee.  The 2nd time, the kid had liquified it, and given it to me to put it in her coffee while she was distracted with the rest of the class, teaching. I did, and everyone saw. We waited and waited, but nothing. Turns out, after class has finished, she spent the whole day in the bathroom.  No one ever said a word, we hated her that much.  Always thought it was hilarious, but now that I look back at it, especially even after I had become a teacher myself, at one point, how fucking dangerous and shitty that was. It was an incredibly stupid thing to do that not only would've gotten me expelled, I might have even had criminal charges put on me and it would've ruined my life.",

Then, one day in my sophomore year, his mother's nudes were leaked to basically the entire school over the course of a single lunch break and no one knew who airdropped them. All I know is that I heard someone say she had a bad breakup with the guy she had been seeing shortly before it all happened, which kinda explains how someone got ahold of them to spread around in the first place. Within the next month or so, they had moved out of state (from Kentucky down to Tennessee) because she couldn't show her face in any local district, all because she sent nudes to someone she thought she could trust at the time. I even feel bad for the kid in the end because even though no one really liked his arrogant ass, no one wants to know that not only has their mother taken nudes, but that at least half of the school *has them on their phones.*\n\nAnother one was in my freshman year, I thought it was normal for people to just prank you a lot.

When he left again and came back the kid was sneaking back in so the teacher went off on him and the kid started mocking him and the teacher just got more and more frustrated until he decided to go get a dean to “deal” with it.

We had annual retreats with the council and it was fun cause I never experienced something as sophisticated yet chill as a retreat, with friends on your own grade level and friends from other grade levels. When I was in 9th Grade, a running gag in the council was picking on a batchmate of mine, who always got honors and generally a really smart guy. Well, in a retreat it kinda escalated in a very intense way. When everyone was chilling in their bunk beds and all the council members were huddled together, a 12th Grader and some 11th Graders were cracking jokes at the poor guy and I remember everyone laughing; and then they started to sexually harass the guy, catching him, until he falls on his ass, to the floor and they promptly stick a finger up his ass but they didn’t put his pants down so it was only rubbing on the fabric so probably also hitting the taint which I’m sure is really unpleasant since they are pressing very hard. He didn’t react in a bad way because to everyone in the room, we were just making jokes, but now I feel bad that I’m recounting feeling off about the incident and yet I didn’t do anything.",

His hair was shaved tight to his skin which did nothing to hide the clumps of earwax caked around his ears. \nHis dad was a massive brute of a man and used to walk his son to school with one hand clasped around the back of the kids neck, and the other hand pushing his bicycle along by the seat. The dad always had his chin up but his eyes glaring into the back of the kids skull. I remember how scared this boy looked every time I saw him walking to school with his dad, his body stiff as a board and his eyes glued forward. \nHe'd also never look at you directly in the eyes, he always gave the side eye so he wasn't making eye contact - everything about this child screams abuse and although I felt something was wrong, I was too young to understand or do anything about it. \n\nKids used to punch and kick him, mess with his shit all the time. I never found it funny and stayed well clear of it all, now I look back and my heart breaks for this kid. I remember him peeing himself during assembly (we used to sit on this polished marble like floor) and every child (and many teachers) got up and ran away, shouting and laughing at him. He was left in the middle of the room surrounded by a big circle of piss and at least fifty laughing kids. He stayed completely silent. I genuinely remember the snorting laughter coming directly from two female teachers. \n\nThe worst one was year 5, the teacher (fully aware that this child does not speak or interact with ANYONE) asked him to come to the board and answer a question in front of the class. He didn't answer, didn't move, just stared ahead like he always did. The kids are all giggling like they know the score, let's all laugh at this kid who doesn't speak. The teacher kept repeating himself and just getting louder and louder and the kids stop giggling, everyone's getting uncomfortable, until the teacher completely lost his shit. I can't remember the words he said to this kid but he grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him out of his chair, literally threw him into the chalkboard and screamed at him, spit and chalk dust flying everywhere. The kid just curled into a ball on the floor and peed himself.\nWe were all in complete shock. The teacher walked out and told us all to follow him out. We had to step over this poor boy to leave the classroom. First time ever I noticed tears in his eyes. \n\nNothing ever came of it, the teacher was still teaching there when I went up to high school.

We were so boonies that we had a \"drive your tractor to school day\" so yeah, small town. I had small cases of bullying that are typical of kids being dumb kids, but it was right when puberty hit us all like a metric ton of bricks that it got bad.\n\nI was a wierd kid, had ADHD and couldn't exactly make good conversation. Plus when I was growing up we didnt make tons of money so I never got to see the new buzz on the TV because we couldn't afford Cable TV, or see the newest movies everyone was talking about so was always on the outside of the newest trends of conversation.\n\nI wasnt very athletic, but liked to read books so I fell in with the wierd kids crowd and rejects, but the punks and goths were their own cliche that were gatekeeping liking music so it was really awkward for me. I felt kinda alone.\n\nNow to the story:\n\n I had a serious case of bullying when I was in my junior highschool days. Going to school on certain days was stressful and I was targeted by one individual in particular we'll call... Steve.\n\nSteve wasn't the most popular guy, but he fit in with everyone. But found me an easy target since it was a known fact that I was the weird kid in class, but Steve turned it up to 11. \n\nThere were verbal assaults, calling me homophobic slurs, make fun of my clothes, a litany of things that were daily or weekly occurrences. But one thing in particular stands out.\n\nIn 8th or 9th grade came a huge assault, Steve cornered me at my locker before a shared math class. I didnt know if this was going to be a hard day or easy day for me but typically when Steve came to my locker, which was an especially rare occurrence, it was going to be really hard. But instead Steve asked to borrow a calculator and was incredibly nice about it.\n\nI was a nice guy, meek, husky, but constantly trying to make friends so of course I let him borrow my calculator, I had a backup anyway. \n\nThe whole math class I wasnt bothered once, and I smiled inwardly hoping that this was a small sign of the winds changing. We split classes afterwards so I didnt expect it back for at least a day (we had homeroom together so I'd ask then). I went on the rest of the day without seeing Steve but hopeful that I scored points so I wrote it off. \n\nThe next day I got to school early, ready to ask about my calculator and what I got was both unexpected and psychologically unhealthy. Steve had defaced my calculator. He had dug into its cover, into its sides, into the battery cover (it was one of those old snap cover calculators that came in blue or purple) it had all been defaced with a colorful acronym:\n\n S.L.A.P.O.S.\n\nhe started calling me that instead of my name, showing the whole homeroom what he had done an loudly, with attention gaining fervor, let everyone present know that SLAPOS stood for SMELLS LIKE A PIECE OF SHIT.\n\nHE CALLED ME THAT FOR THE REST OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.\n\nThat whole day I blocked out but was basically Steve spreading the great word of SLAPOS. Other kids in our class started calling me that and laughing along. \n\nI had no outlet, I had no one to tell really. I didn't stand up for myself. I just rode it out for the rest of the year whatever was left of it.\n\nSteve, wherever you are, I have recovered. I became a productive member of society, I have friends whom I trust and children that I love. I have nothing to prove to you, nor will I ever, but in my hear of hearts I hope your circumstances have turned you into a better human being. And if not, I hope you have to travel a mile barefoot on broken glass covered in lemon juice and salt, heal, then do it again. \n\nTL;DR\nI had a bully deface my calculator with a colorful name and got called that the rest of the school year.",

Her mother and father were there cheering her on. Anyway, I changed schools. I lived in a children home with no more than 5 kids. We were about 14 at the time. One day as we got off the bus,  ( WE ALL WENT TO DIFFERENT SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE UK) One girl from my children's home said we were going to beat up a girl from her school. At that age there was no question, you look after your 'family'. Didn't even know what this child had done. We called her and made her follow us into an alleyway where we then proceeded to jump her. Kicking punching. I feel I took out my anger on that girl that day. Like I said i was bullied. She had extentions in and when we left her, her hair was all over the ground.  When we left I asked what she had done. And guess what? Nothing. She was even younger than us... about 2 years younger in fact! I still feel awful to this day. Remember when I told you I got dragged off a swing by my bully? This was about a year before this incident. \nGuess who was sat on the swings next to me. That same girl from my children's home. The same girls I jumped another person for. And they watched as I got beaten. To this day, I'm 31 years old and I want to find that girl and apologise. I want to kick my bullies ass to this day. 😤 I know how it felt, that what's worse.\nI hope she's OK. Learning about what severe bullying can drive kids to do. I pray for her. I have 2 daughters now. 8 and 5. I pray judgement comes for me and not my babies. I'm teaching them morals, about everyone, no matter their race, disabilities gender or sexual preferences. I want them to do right and not just jump to hurt someone just because your friend has a problem with them. As a teenager you Don't even think about why it's wrong. Anyway. I've gone on for so long.\nGod bless everyone and please be safe.",

            "text": "I have a unique example.\n\nDuring senior year of high school, all boys, we had a new teacher with doctorate. Another student greeted him out loud “Hey Dr Homo!”  \n\nI was very introverted back then but some students either joined in or laughed. I am bi and several were in the closet so I figure it was mostly peer pressure and blending in that caused many to join in, plus we were dumb teenagers. In retrospect he did nothing but exist. At the time I never stuck my neck out for anyone. Now I feel bad for the way the boys would weed out teachers like lions looking for the weak in the herd.\n\nThe story does not end there. Back then we knew nothing about the guy except dr and teacher. A few times his girlfriend stopped by and she was a 10. His steer cred increased immediately. Decades later found out he was the scion of a rich political family. His teaching was a passion.\n\nShortly after graduation he was promoted to dean of boys. This was mostly a position where you were the school disciplinarian. He  used this power to lure boys in trouble. The deal was he would not tell their parents, if they would go to his place. Many were sons of immigrants and expected to be the first to go to college. Eventually Richie Rich used a school flatbed scanner to digitize his pics and forgot to remove the original. He was reported and eventually arrested. BTW the school never told the parents until the last possible second.\n\nSo the single event, bad male teen behavior and regrettable but ironically it was on a garbage person who deserved far worse than ridicule. Ironically I talked heckler guy many years later and he admitted it was really crazy bold move, he wondered if it was some sort of latent sixth sense. \n\nP.S. catholic school so yeah informing parents of a controversy is not their in their DNA.",

They weren't anything explicit, and most if them didn't even have a vagina drawn, since I didn't know how to draw them at the time. It was literally just cute anime girls in regular poses, but with the titties out.\n\nI guess it turned out well enough, because I became the class's hentai artist for about 3 days, before a teacher put a stop to it. The boys tried to put all the blame on me, which had me bawling my eyes out, thinking I was gonna get expelled for something I didn't know was wrong, but thankfully, the teacher who caught us knew me well enougb to know this was not the usual stuff I would doodle on my notebooks. She figured out that the boys probably made me, or tricked me into it, so she let me go after explaining that I was too young to be drawing stuff like this.\n\nAs an adult, I can acknowledge this was fucked up for 11 or 12 year old me, and I probably developed a lot of codependency issues/ craving approval at all cost due to stuff like this.

When one of the other students confronted her about it she essentially told a student to shut up and mind your own business. One day when she was in her supply closet no doubt feeding her pie hole one of the students got up and locked her in the closet there was a padlock he locked it. He looked up at the class and said class is dismissed we all split. Come to find out the next day she stayed locked in the closet until 6 o’clock that night when the janitor came by to empty her trash and vacuum the classroom. The following day the vice principal was in her class sitting on the corner of her desk swinging his leg. He confronted us about who did it,nobody said anything and we all sat in detention for three days until someone finally gave in. It was cruel but she’s so deserved it",

I typed too much in order for me to just delete it 😅(i personally never found it funny but my classmates sure did) So there was a boy that was in my class in the 3rd grade and he would frequently take his penis out and play with it while in class. The worst part is the teacher SAW it and never said anything about it either! The boys would all think it was funny and some would even join him in doing the same thing. Not wanting to be left out more than i already was as a kid, i would laugh and the girls i would sit with would talk about them and say how ones “hotdog” looked better than another boys and i would just nod along. Looking back, it’s horrific that 1) i was only in elementary school and was seeing another boys private parts without wanting to and 2) having to have that conversation with my mom WAY earlier than either of us had expected. Once that conversation happened, she ended up calling to the school and telling them about the boys behavior. The principal replied “well you know, boys will be boys”. YEAH. Apparently my mom was not the first to call and discuss the behavior either and each angry parent was met with the same nonchalant nature of the 50, year old principal. WANNA HEAR THE REAL KICKER?! the principal was arrested in 2016 (the year after i graduated high school) for possession of child pornography AND inappropriate touching of a child. so, you can imagine my moms reaction when i shared that with her! \n\nGenuinely, that was something i had been holding onto for a VERY long time. This happened when i was 8 years old. and i am 25 now so that was actually very therapeutic",

In my 4 years of high school we ran through 8 principals, 4 assistant principals, and countless teachers. Students harassed & bullied them into quitting because they were so miserable. The only teachers who survived were the ones who caved in and just let us do whatever we wanted. My regular school supplies were a blanket, headphones & a phone charger. No need for text books, not that my district could afford them anyways.  My science credit one semester was “Forensic Science” and we didn’t have actual curriculum, or a teacher. We watched Forensic Files with a substitute for a full semester.\nIn other classes we watched Netflix, played cards & generally just sat around. If a teacher actually wanted us to work, students would literally just tell them to fuck off. Our district had previously been sued by a very large civil rights group for racial discrimination, so discipline for student misbehavior was non-existent out of fear of another lawsuit. It was a literal zoo with kids running around doing whatever they damn well pleased. I kinda thought it was funny at the time, but I still remember one teacher, a man from Sudan, who had definitely seen some shit in his time… Students couldn’t understand his accent and just generally didn’t want to learn anyways. They bullied him into quitting less than one semester in. He cried on the day he quit, gave us all failing grades, and walked out with the most defeated look I’ve seen on a grown man. \nEven the smartest kids from my class aren’t doing much now that we are in our mid twenties. I caught up with our valedictorian the other day. He works the front desk at a barber shop. Several of the kids from my class are dead, in jail, or on their 3rd kid. Almost no one got out of that town. It’s just a swirling cesspool of poverty, drugs & guns.",

It wasn’t directed at any individual. But it was based on a wildly amoral disrespect for public property and public safety.\n\nThe security “campus 5-0” was not up to dealing with it. It was a big campus, and presumably a very small and barely qualified (and of course unarmed) “force”. The municipal cops were always too long responding. Periods of activity were never allowed to continue for long and followed by months of other diversions.\n\nIt all seemed hilarious at the time: good fun and daring.\n\nI look back on it now and cringe. It was serious vandalism. People could have been hurt badly, although to my knowledge no one ever was. Drugs would later do in several of the guys, but that was at the end of high school and later. Some of the group could have been caught, gone to jail or reform school at least, and had their lives really messed up. Funnily enough, one went on to be a cop, actually he was about the worst bully I knew growing up - but that is another story.\n\nWhen my children grew up, in another city and 30 years later, parents were much more involved in organizing activities.

It was always hard to watch, but one day before class started and our teacher arrived, someone had the bright idea to rip out some of their own pubic hairs and place them on the overhead projector (the math teacher used it frequently) Others classmates joined in, while others laughed, but refrained from the pube-graffiti. \nEventually the math teacher arrived. He turned the projector on, and on the screen was his math lesson for the day sprinkled with several dozen pubic hairs. \nThe classroom was filled with the sound of stifled laughter while my math teacher looked on in confusion. As I sat there wondering how he was going to handle this disrespectful act, he simply made a smirk with a hint disappointment behind it, and brushed off the hairs with his hands (a visual that remains in my mind 20+ years later) and continued with the lesson. \nThe prank had little-to-no payoff, but I remember how it felt to watching this man simply accept this vile act as just another day at the office.",

One day during the final days of school, people were getting frustrated because they were struggling really bad on their work. So many people had questions and constantly needed help. This gave her an overloaded of stress, to make matters even worse someone called her out and argued with her that she was bad at what she was doing and making everyone fail.

It was a horrible situation for her because people didn’t take her serious and she had other teachers there to support her during that situation.

At the end of the year, the seniors did their usual prank... fun right? They put a Mini Cooper in out cafeteria, which was crazy since the high school didn't have double doors. It was a feat.\nBut the real \"fun\" didn't start until most people had left. 3 a**holes decided to stay and do more damage. They broke furniture and then they decided to target their least favorite teachers. My bio teacher, whose ex wife worked in the same school, got all his desks broken, and his room was papered with scantily clad pictures of his ex. The closeted Spanish teacher got her classroom covered in lesbian porn.\nI was a junior at the time, and I was the first one to my bio class so I helped him clean up. Every single senior was thrown off the premises because the 3 wouldn't confess. They weren't allowed back until graduation, and then they were all escorted out again. I just saw these teachers become real people, who were struggling and miserable and so hurt by the kids that were their lives' work.",

If there ever was a girl in our group who’d had a fight with her boyfriend or a break up he was right there, offering a shoulder and asking them to dinner. At the time it seemed sweet… \n\nFast forward to many (10-20) years later, he’s still doing this. The women happened to stay the same age for the most part, as he gets older. He’s enjoyed being “the guy your boyfriend worries about”. All while claiming ignorance as to why. \n\nFor me personally, my final straw was realizing that I invited a couple of true blue guy friends to my wedding -both married and solid, good friends- to make sure Ned didn’t try anything. Even then, it hadn’t fully sunk in that Ned wasn’t someone I needed around. He did try to intervene, but before the guys could get to him, the flavor of the month he insisted on bringing with him (never met her, didn’t meet her, but she brought a gift?) stopped him. I didn’t find this out until roughly two years later when I went to a birthday party for one of those ‘bouncers’ and his wife mentioned it. We were mortified. I’ve never made Ned feel like he had a chance. Never. In our multiple year friendship I’d been very clear, ‘you are my friend and nothing more, if that isn’t something you are okay with, or it’s too difficult for you, I’m ending the friendship”. He always assured me he was ‘okay’ with it. \n\nHe’s not a good human, coming to that conclusion was hard. But, the day I unfriended him and deleted his number from my phone was freeing… in a way I didn’t expect.",

She taught English and social studies so 2 period 3rd-4th. First 2 weeks she was very strict, and as a kid that was in gifted classes she gave out a lot of work. I still have no clue what happened but from one day to another it just collapsed, no one listened and no one did ANY work from that day on. If I remember correctly I did do one piece of work that was a winter break paper and I passed the class just on that but that was literally it. She would just start handing out detentions and referrals (which was when they sent you to your counselor and they call your parents and after 3 I think you get Saturday school) I had NEVER gotten a detention or referral in all my years. That year I got 4 referrals and like 3 detentions for simply being around the chaos ohhh AND got all my 8th grade activities taken away for this story I’m about to tell. So like I said this teacher was losing control, no one ever listened and she would just lose her shit and the principal or 8th grade counselor would literally come up to the room and have to teach lol. So one day in the middle of class she was in the middle of losing her shit and was just handing out referrals and detentions and some kid threw a skittle at her and SHE LOST IT. She started screaming she started crying and she called like the WHOLE security and principal and I think she was trying to call the cops at one point 😂😂. Everyone got their 8th grade activities taken away and she left home early that day. It was very funny when it happened (still kinda is) but I realize now as a 28M that it was fucked up. I would add that she would lose her shit for no reason and I felt like the class was just over it and realized that we should just ride it out. I’d also add that last day of school she was SO HAPPY 😂😂😂 she was even joking around with the class clowns. I think that day was like the only day ever that we said bye to her and we’re sort of nice.\n\nHonorary mention story that year: it was a Friday and the teacher wasn’t there so we had a sub. I sat next to legit punks, spikey hair with the tight pants studded leather etc… so my friend was drinking a Gatorade and about a min before the bell rang he took a piss in the empty bottle, opened up a drawer that held all the huge books and left it there. Apparently it stood there all weekend and the following Monday they found it and the whole class reeked of piss.

Dad sat in the dark living room drinking and would hand Greg two $100 bills (1990!) and send us to eat. \n\nGreg had all the material goods, but he hated everyone. David was thin, sickly and pimply, but funny, bright and witty. \n\nI eventually told Greg off but to this day feel bad that it took me months. \n\nGreg's a fat attorney, same town he grew up in. Looks like an alcoholic. Probably still hates himself.\n\nPimply David went on to a nice career as a writer. You may even know of him.",

I had a classmate who was a super edgy kid, always in need of attention, and surrounded by flock of ladies who would always follow him around. At some point, he said he was bisexual and sometimes would just go for kiss with random male who would be passing by, just to make his girlfriends laugh.\n\nOnce he chose a wrong target, it was one of the most aggressive dudes in school with nickname - \"Frost\" (moroz in rus). He was massive and two years older, so when my classmate went for his kissing routine this guy just bitted the shit out of him in pure rage. I am reminding u that we are talking about Russia in early 2000s and getting a kiss from male in front of everyone was the biggest insult u could imagine for a boy, so nobody expected a different outcome.\n\nAs a result, my classmate went to Hospitals for couple of weeks, and Frost got kicked out of school. We all thought it was funny back than, but now it does seem like quite a fucked up situation",

It’s stupidity that really today would land someone in huge trouble with the school with harassment, and criminal for sexual harassment and assault. It was common as getting slapped on the butt playing sports. That happened non-stop, and even to this day I occasionally see it on television. That was more our own gender.

Worse was her mother refusing to let another family adopt him when a neighborhood friend had lined up a couple from their church who couldn't have their own child. She would let the guy sit in soiled dippers because she refused to change him, making him wait until her mom got home from work.

It didn't break out into a fight or anything, he was just shocked and we went about our business. We actually became friends later on in high school.

            "text": "Ok this is a weird one. In elementary school, a “popular” girl invited me to her birthday sleepover. I was so excited, I’m pretty sure we were in maybe 4th or 5th grade, so around 10 or 11 years old.  I showed up and there were 6 of us girls total. We ate pizza, swam in the pool and she opened presents. Pretty typical birthday up until it was time to go to bed. That’s when things got weird. \n\nHer parents left. They straight up left us all alone. She must have known they weren’t coming back any time soon because that’s when the bday girl said “Hey! Let’s watch my parent’s porn tapes!” So we all giggled and ran into her parents room to dig through their porn collection. Turns out… it wasn’t a porn collection but her parents PRIVATE amateur home recordings. So we all sat around and watched her parents going at it. She seemed like it was totally normal and that she watched them all the time. As if that wasn’t bad enough, it got worse. \n\nThen the bday girl said she wanted to play truth or dare. At first it was pretty typical “who do you like at school” and “go touch the mailbox and come back” type of stuff. But then the bday girl started getting into some weird shit like “do you ever touch yourself down there” and “poke my dogs butthole” and just creepy shit like that. The night ended up with this poor little girl (too shy to say no) crawling around and letting their unfixed dog hump her “until the pink thing comes out and touches you”. The birthday girl even knew how to get the dog to do it and coached poor Kirsten how to crawl around to get the dog to jump on her. One of the girls ended up kissing the bday girl and groping her etc. I was creeped out, but you know how kids just laugh at everything no matter how weird it is. So Luckily I didn’t end up getting humped by a dog or groped, but I did feel creepy for having sat there and laughed about it. \n\nI will never get the image of Kirsten’s terrified face as she was being humped by a dog for like 3 minutes. Or the image of this weird bday girl watching videos of her mom and dad going at it. Needless to say I never went back to her house after that and I broke off my friendship with all of them. I wonder what ever happened to them all.",

We got along pretty well even though we were completely different in almost every way. I was an introverted kid who didn't really get involved with drugs or alcohol. Alex on the other hand was notoriously known for being a huge stoner and just had this wild extroverted personality to him. I didn't really care to be honest, we laughed at similar things and created inside jokes during classes. It made the public school experience much more tolerable. \n\nLooking back now. I kinda realize just how wild Alex actually was. We would talk about all the people we just despised in high school. We would joke about ways in which they would cease to exist. I thought it was pretty harmless at the time. You don't really consider just how serious it is to be joking about that kind of thing as a teenager. Things kinda took a turn one day when Alex started making a list of kids he thought \"should be thrown in a wood-chipper\"....  I didn't think anything of it so I started rattling off some names of people that I too did not like. When class ended there was probs 10 names on the list. The next day. Alex came in with about 50+ plus names. Clearly I wasn't the only one who thought it was funny because other kids in our school gave Alex the suggested names for the list\n\nAlex was a bit of rebel and would just do as he pleased. He use to charge his E-Cigarette in class out in the open with 0 shits given. One of our teachers had enough of his shit and sent him to principals office. Upon arrival his bag was searched for suspicious items. And what did they find? You guessed it.

But for the me, back then in Ireland these weren’t bad in my eyes, it’s what shaped us and hardened us up, being a 1st year and kicking the bottle and winning or being a younger year taking on a older year in murder ball and winning and having one or two lads make a big scene and dominate was just a cool thing and a badge of honour, reminiscing writing these here, makes me miss the old days and being a kid, and I hope some of these weird traditions are still alive",

I had a huge crush on him and tried several times to express my interest in him; however, I was still very immature and did the whole \"do you like me?\" in a note kind of thing (😵). Anyway, we were good friends! But... he would always \"falcon punch\" my boobs. Not hard at all, but he would \"scoop\" me-- THAT'S what it was called... Scooping! Scooping was fucked up. So, anyway, I would like and be like, \"staaaahppp itttt,\" but also giggle it off. Anyway, that was definitely not right.\n\n2. In middle school, I remember a group of boys carried me into the boys locker room when it was time to change back and go to our next classes. They were laughing and I was so confused and scared, especially because some of these guys were my friends. As soon as I got up, I ran out of there and did that upset/angry/scared kind of slow cry and it always stuck...\n\n3. In elementary school-- like... 3rd grade? 4th? I don't remember-- a boy (who I thought was annoying, but still a friend) gave me a titty twister. Thankfully, I had the courage to tell someone about it. It's crazy though because the only thing that happened was that the principal talked to the two of us together and he was just like, scolded. At the time, I was like kinda whatever about it and just carried on. I don't even think my mom was informed now that I think of it!\n\n4. Elementary school. Playing with 3 guy friends on the playground. One of them slapped me across the face; I swear to God, as my face turned back to look at him, I had those angry tears going on, grabbed him by the arm, swung him around, and let him fly into our heavy-set friend who fell. Didn't see that guy until the end of the day and he apologized.\n\n5. Middle school. One of the PE teachers was known for being a creep/perv. It was really weird because this one time, he \"punished\" the girls by having us turn and face the wall on the outside of the gym, put our hands stretched up and onto the wall, and like... all I remember now is just having to stand like that for a minute... it was so weird.\n\n6. Middle school. I was friends with a girl who had a crush on a male teacher. She would tell me about how \"in love\" she was with him. She would stay after class and spend time with him, talk with him, things like that. She told me at one point that they kissed. After high school, a couple years after, I found out the dude had sexual relations with a student(s) and was arrested. I should have told someone!!!!\n\n.\n.\n.\nFuck, idk, I have so much more now that I think about it... /:",

Had the “tramp stamp” and everything to prove it. Anyway also had a kid that was somewhat a friend named Nick, that was a total pothead. Well one day we’re sitting at our desks doing a paper and the teacher walks out. Nick out of no where decides this is a good time in the middle of class to pull out his bowl, light it, and take a hit. Now everyone in the class saw it, and you could especially smell it, except for the two girls in class. One of which was my GF, who was a bit of a goody goody two shoes, and her best friend, they would’ve totally ratted him out if they knew. So my GF is asking me repeatedly what happened, why the room smells, and why everyone is laughing. I just told her don’t worry about it, I’ll tell you later. So the teacher comes back and goes “Oh what’s that smell? It’s familiar.” All the boys including me in class started laughing even more at her answer, and replied “we don’t smell anything” to protect Nick from getting kicked out of school. Teacher sits back down, class resumes, and finally the bell rings. Nick had a hard life growing up, and irresponsible parents, in fact his dad had died just a few months prior, drinking and riding his motorcycle. I ran into the teacher a few years ago and told her of the incident. She said she knew what it was, but didn’t want to see him kicked out, and neither did his classmates. But it turns out he wasn’t worth protecting, he dropped out anyway, and turned into a disaster. Should’ve just let my gf rat him out, it would’ve made no difference. I still feel sorry for him, that he couldn’t see the light to get himself to a better place in life. Read a couple years ago in the paper he was arrested for something I can’t remember at the moment.

The idea was that it helps people wake up and makes you smarter. In high school, people started taking this a little less seriously but I liked the time to wake up or reflect or look over my homework or read something interesting. \n\nOne morning, this girl who sat two rows away from me just said loudly \"HEY MYCABBAGESHELP WHAT'S YOUR BRA SIZE?\" and I just froze. I couldn't believe she said that. I tried to pretend that I was really seriously reading my book, but she asked again. My reply was \"Why do you need to know?\" And she responded, \"I wanted to know if my guess was right or not.\" I wasn't sure if the (male) teacher overheard this or not, and I figured the entire class was listening so I just didn't say anything. But I had her for first period and last period too. \n\nI didn't know what to do because it didn't seem like obvious bullying. I don't remember if I gave her my size or not tbh. Everyone was interested because I was a bit bigger than most of my peers. If someone did that to me now I'd tell them it's sexual harassment. At the time the impression was \"oh it's just two girls gossiping girls couldn't harass each other.\"\n\nA few weeks later she cornered me before first period with 5 reasons I should be raped. They were dumb reasons like \"your body shape is too sexual for you to be a virgin\" or \"you have non virginal thoughts.\" I ended up going to my best friend at lunch and asking her \"hey do you think I deserve to be raped? This girl told me so.\" A teacher overheard me and said \"Look MyCabbagesHelp if you keep talking about this then I will have to report someone for bullying you\" so I changed topics. This girl had given me a detailed description of how she wanted me to be raped by my boyfriend and if my boyfriend wasn't willing to rape me then she wanted to force him to rape me. I was fucking 14. I ended up getting raped 10 months after she said that, so it's always stuck with me. She had nothing to do with it, but I will never forget her. \n\nI excused it all because I knew she had depression and her family was really racist against her.

I recognized the name in the phone and decided to play a \"prank\" before finding the girl and returning it. What I did was call up the parents phone and growl \"We have your son and/or daughter!\" in what was supposed to be a death metal growl but sounded more like a shouty cookie monster. Immediately afterwards I called again and told the mom that it was actually someone that found her daughter's phone and that there was no danger, I remember her sounding somewhat amused and telling me that she assumed that it was a joke from one of her friends. Later that day I found the girl and returned the phone.\n\nLooking back it wasn't just an incredibly stupid thing to do, but a complete invasion of that girl's privacy to go through her phone's contacts like that. Even worse to make a joke out of someone's daughter getting abducted, regardless of whether the mom falls for the infantile joke.

One day, some kids went out to put out notes and found that someone had cleaned up all of it, except for the chalk. It came out by the end of the day that one of the special Ed students had actually done it. He had taken the notes and put them in his locker, and had taken the flowers and given them to his girlfriend. Nobody was sure why he had done it. People were furious. To the point that a couple of the boys closest friends decided that they were going to corner this guy and his girlfriend, and beat them up until they gave back everything and explained why they had done it. They corned these two, both special needs, and beat them up. Everybody knew who had done it. I don’t know who ended up telling, but before I got to the principal, someone else had told. It took me a bit to work up the courage, because I was afraid of their wrath turning on me. I remember being in the office and saying “hey I want to say who did this” and then the principal saying “yeah I already know.” The guys got expelled I’m pretty sure, but not before bragging about beating them up for at least a couple days. \n\n\nBack then, I saw it was fucked up.

Everyone once in a while my school would do a charity 'non-uniform' day where you'd donate to the charity and be allowed to wear normal clothes to school that day. The weird kid came into school on non-uniform day wearing a slipknot t shirt that was recently in a music video in the style of Jerry springer with the tag line 'i think my son is a necrophiliac' so every day from then on I called the weird kid the necro and it caught on pretty fast, the rumor went around the whole school and pretty much everyone believed it. \n\nNow, me and the weird kid had the same science class and we got on okay so some times I would end up being partners with him for some group stuff. Our science teacher was a very hardened old man, ex boxer, would stink of whiskey and 'go to the supply cupboard' at least twice a lesson and come back smelling of smoke. He set us away on our task, which was to dissect a sheep heart and draw diagrams, and he went of his smoke. \n\nDuring this time me and the weird kid are taking turns cutting up the heart, one person drawing and the other cutting, still no sign of the teacher. It got to the end of the lesson and the teacher came flying in to let us go at the end of the lesson and counting the scalpels. I send the weird kid to the front with my knife and while he was gone I put the mashed up sheep heart into a plastic glove and put it inside the tiny little compartment in the weird kids bag. On the last day. Of a two week break. Of course he just threw it in his locker without thinking. \n\nAfter the two week holiday that whole corridor would stink of decomposition, for weeks, his bag was ruined, it would smell so bad for at least a fortnight before got a new one, and all of this just fed into the rumor that he did awful things to dead bodies.

If you can imagine about 300 kids all squished together on the basketball court talking and showing off cards it was easy to get lost in the crowd. So what we’d do, is find who has cards of high value and creep up behind them while they’re flashing their cards and slap the wad of cards from their hands up in the air and it was just a free for all.

I refused to do the assignment for a month, so everyday I would have to stand out the class and for the assignment and go to the library to \"work on it\".

I told him that the teacher didn't went me in her class and how long its happening. He told me to get up and we made our way to the teachers class, he got her to come out to talk. She tried to explain what happened and why she didn't want me in her class but my principal was like \"you have no excuse to keep education away from any child now let him back in and I hope this is the last time this happens\" more or less along those lines. She let me back in holding back tears i take me seat, not even 2 minutes back in i try to take something off her desk in the back... She turns around and asks \"what are you doing?\" Me nonchalant say \"nothing\" trying to hold back a nervous smile.

The class erupted in laughter as it looked like a comedy sketch, but I genuinely thought the teacher was dead for a moment - the weight of those TV’s back then were no joke. \n\nI looked down and the TV looked mounted on the teachers back like a turtle. After pushing it off them, they said they were fine and left the classroom, but when I followed, the teacher was hunched over in the corridor gasping for breath whilst the classroom was roaring with laughter. \n\nObviously an accident but could’ve reacted better.",

We had a woodworking class where the teacher pretty much didn’t give a shit what the students did. I lived in a “rural” city where a lot of the dudes thought they were rednecks and dipped tobacco. So, often in wood shop class all the kids would dip and the teacher didn’t give a shit at all. What ended up happening was the seniors thought it would be funny to, throughout the year, spit in one of those big 5 gallon water jugs you see in offices with the water cups and all. Anyways, throughout the whole year they spit their nasty tobacco spit from their dip into this big ass jug until the last week of the school year. We had an open style school where the hallways were just a big open areas with two floors where you can look down to the first floor. Think of a mall with stores on both floors. The cafeteria area was pretty much the whole bottom floor open area and one of the seniors carried the jug on the second level to the middle area where the lunch-lines and some tables were and opened it, turned it upside down and let it drop on everyone below. Unfortunately it landed directly on this poor girls head and not only did she get absolutely drenched but she also hit her head pretty hard (lucky it didn’t land directly in her neck because it would have killed her). She was soaked and it was a god awful smell, but I was far enough away to not get any impact other than the smell.  They never caught the guy who threw it either",

I'd eat whatever I could take from my house and bring to school and make do with that. \nWith the money I saved, in case you're wondering, I'd buy what I was \"stealing\" from home so she would not notice it.\n\nSo ye, Fuck D and all the other dudes.",

However, B made a comment that really punched me in the gut, and it was something along the lines of, “She must really love kids if she’s continued teaching after all these years of being hated.” That stuck with me, and I started realizing in retrospect that she actually was a really nice teacher whom everyone hated for absolutely no good reason. And I was in on the joke just because I wanted to follow the crowd and be “cool.”\n\nThat teacher passed away from some sort of cancer a couple years later while I was still in high school.

My little 6th grade class destroyed anyone who tried to take that place. The class probably had like 30 kids total in the entire 6th grade. But it was like 20 of them ganged together to make sure we did not learn science that year. They would destroy the classroom, destroy the teachers items. Take the teachers stuff and hid it. They never seemed to really get caught either. That year we went through a new teacher every week. At one point we had one teacher who stayed there for about a month. When she found out she was pregnant, she quit. She admitted to some of the students, me included, that she was scared for her child's safety. We had one male teacher that was very big. I remember hearing another teacher and students making jokes about his weight. He didn't last longer than 2 weeks. \nNone of us did very well on the science standardized that year. \n\nSame students. But 8th grade now. And math teacher. I hated math until I met her. She tried her hardest to help anyone who wanted help. She explained everything in a way that is understood. \nBut she had something that made her skin turn really red in patches all over. So course those same kids were horrible to her. They called her the hulk. One day after months of this. I could tell she had enough. She turned around from the board and basically yelled at everyone. She was a very soft spoken lady, so that was odd for her to yell. She told everyone her medical reason for her skin and said if anyone has a problem, she will be contacting their parents. She quit the next year. I forgot her name but I miss her. I really wish I knew how she was doing. \n\nSame students. Another teacher. But we had this teacher all 3 years. She taught ELA. This lady was a much older teacher. She was mean. No body liked her. Called her a witch. She was always nice to me. But to be fair, I'm like a teachers pet. Maybe the reason I'm a teacher now. But they never got her to quit or miss a day. She passed away a few years ago. \n\nHigh school time now: \nOur English 2 teacher was promoted to the library. We were given a temporary teacher. She was very very young. Like right out of school. She had a baby face as well. She always wore very tight clothes. After a few weeks of being there, rumors started to spread of her having sex with students. No one believed it. Until the picture started backing it up. Not really sure what happened to her though. \n\nYeah, same kids from middle school.",

We’re all outside and then out of the blue one of the girls steps a few feet away to take a call, and it sounds like she’s making plans to walk across the street to get a taxi from the mall and leave(we were in a European city where this is normal). We were all bummed when she said she was leaving and one of us had the good sense to ask if she was going home. \nShe wasn’t. She had been on the phone with one of the teachers at our school, she was going to watch his band play at some bar, and all of us were basically like “not a fucking chance”, we wouldn’t let her leave until she told her parents where she was going, she tried to talk her dad into it and i don’t remember how the interaction went, and it was through the phone so we couldn’t hear much but he was disgusted. We all knew it was weird, but never brought it up again looking back, it’s super disturbing. The next year I was on my school’s cheerleading team and at one of the sleepovers we were talking about rumors and one of the seniors was telling us how supposedly this teacher had slept with a graduated former student the previous year while she was back for Christmas. \n\nIt was a small private school and the students and teachers generally got along really well. That Monday two of the other girls and I were in class with another teacher discussing our weekends. This teacher was and still is my favorite teacher I ever had, there was a moment when we were telling him about our shenanigans  over the weekend where I almost asked him if I could tell him something in private to ask him if the situation was as weird as it seemed. I didn’t thought because I wasn’t sure I had the whole story or blowing it out of proportion and had a vague idea of how if I was wrong It would ruin the teacher on the phone’s life. I’m now a teacher and can’t help but realize how messed up it was, I still don’t know if we had the full story, like if he had invited the whole class and we just hadn’t caught that bit—it was an accelerated class and she was the only middle schooler in a class with the high schoolers, and seeing as it was a European city where bars were really popular with high schoolers and it wasn’t unusual to see the younger teachers at a bar. From what I remember though it was just her. It was also well before bars would be open with live music when this went down and the girl was wanting to leave right then and not go home so I wonder if she was going straight there or meeting the teacher before. I haven’t been friends with the girl who was on the phone with the teacher in years and while I’m still friends with the other girls and we talk out it from time to time none of us are sure we know the whole story so it’s our weird “hey, remember when this happened when we were kids? So weird” story.",

The first interaction I had with him was when we were waiting outside class together and he was slowly clenching his fist in and out, he seemed really focused. I literally just said 'nice hands' then looked away and started talking to some other students. He then proceeded to grab my hair and smash me against the locker I was leaning on about 4 times. He then acted like it was nothing, it kinda hurt but I just moved away from him cause I had no idea if he was joking or not as I had never seen him before. We then got into class and the teacher started doing role call. I called out 'here' when I heard my name but the kid started to get really angry cause we shared the same name and he thought I was trying to annoy him again. It got really bad and he started throwing chairs and desks around the room, he nearly hurt several kids. The whole class left the room and I think the school nearly went into lockdown.\n\nFast forward to year ten and he's changed to a school for students with special needs. Was very scary for me as I had no idea he had autism and it was very sudden and unexpected. There was a lot of kids who were really mean to him and bullied him for having autism so in some ways I do really feel sorry for him and I hope he is doing ok now.

He would hurl insults at us that he looked up on Google the night before. You could tell because of how rehearsed they sounded. One day in music class I was in a bad mood for some reason. He was touching my zilophone. Not changing anything, but it got on my nerves. I shouted at him in front of the class. He sat quietly in his chair before turning red and storming out of the class.\nWe all laughed as he left and one of my friends was impressed that I shouted. (I wasn't known for raising my voice back then.) Anyway, this kid couldn't keep his grades up. Was always distracted and never did his assignments. He ended up getting held back and we celebrated because we didn’t have to go into high school with him. He was the laughing stalk and the butt of alot of our jokes. We would talk shit about him behind his back alot.\nIn hindsight, he might have had ADHD, ADD or been on the spectrum. He also suffered a seizure in class. He didn't come from a very well off family. You could tell by his clothes. He might have just been looking for friends by antagonizing us because he had bad social skills and thought getting our attention in that way was how we rolled.\nHe even dressed in different styles every day. One day he would dress in a suit, the next like a black guy(white kid's interpretation of a stereotypical black man. Backwards cap, chains, low pants etc.) The day he dressed snazzy he didn't get a compliment. So I remember him declaring himself handsome at the end of the day, because no one else did. Eventually some altercations between him and me got the attention of a teacher and she made me apologize. A few weeks after that he said, \"We're like best buddies now.\" I ignored him for the rest of the time I knew him. His family moved after we entered high school. Never saw Michael again(that was his name, but I'm lazy).\nHe really was just a lonely kid looking for attention, approval and friends. We didn’t give him that. No one did. I hate bullies and being excluded. I sometimes wonder if in middle school I became the thing I hate. \nNow in college, I wonder what happened to him.",

Kids got severely hurt multiple times, tons of them got suspended (once expelled), a drunk kid fell on the tracks and almost died. Other train passengers tried suing the high school which resulted in every single student being banned from any not at home game. Parents were pissed. Other towns were pissed. Security started turning groups wearing our high school gear away from the train. Plus it cost the local T millions in total. \n\nEventually the cops started actually charging people involved and it stopped. The kids who were freshman during the end of this are seniors now, one of them recently tried restarting this trend.

They done lots of things to that woman though, me included to be fair. She got called fat a lottt and had lots of jokes with her name to do with that. She ended up leaving after only like 2 or 3 years, not sure if we had anything to do with it but it honestly wouldn’t surprise me.\n\nIve got lots of other ones but thats probably one of the worst.. \nAlthough i had some teachers do some messed up stuff. struggled at school and did not get along with many of the teachers, my art teacher did not like me and i Didnt like him so i tried to work outside whenever possible as there was an undercover area out back. One day my bag was inside next to the door instead of on the rack and he came out to yell at me about it and say he was moving it. I said i wasn’t even near it but id grab it and move it since it was open and i had spare clothes and smokes in it that i didn’t want him seeing, he got mad and said he would do it and grabbed it anyway, i just followed him over and closed it. Maybe 10 minutes later he came back out saying everyone needed to come in as someone stole his keys etc. everyone was trying to say nobody had a reason to do that (including a student teacher who was in the room) but he was refusing to believe it and kept insisting on getting the deputy to do bag searches. After so long of everyone looking, nothing happening and him still insisting they were stolen i decided to grab my cigarettes out as i didn’t want them getting confiscated. I opened my bag and when i moved my clothes his keys fell out of them. This like 40 something year old seedy ass man put his keys in my bag and tried to insist on getting the deputy to search bags to get me in trouble. I gave them to him and he was all like “ah and where’d you find these then —“ and it was so cocky and smug and just weird about it. it was probably a week after id gotten a scholarship for an expensive class and to this day i’m assuming he wanted to get me expelled or at least in enough trouble to screw me over. I did try have a conversation with the deputy principal and while i was crying with like 3 other people from the class with me with the same story she turned around and said “none of my teachers are vindictive to do that to a student” and told me that they must have just dropped and it was all a misunderstanding and mans still works there. The more I’ve thought about it the more messed up it is to me that nothing happened at all and there wasn’t even any further questions or blame on him. His keys were on a keychain looped around his belt buckle 24/7 like it doesn’t exactly seem likely it was an accident. I was lucky enough to not be in his class again after that year but the deputy screwed me over until the day i graduated. I have no respect for that lady or man and i will forever wish them the worst.",

One of my friends, let’s call him Chris, would let us stay at his for the night after the parties. It was a small house so a few of us slept in the same rooms where his younger sisters would be out (both his sisters were minors).\n\nAfter coming back from a party, the same friend would tell us to go back to his for the night. Me and this guy, let’s call him Mike, we’re sleeping in the same room. Chris’s little sisters room. \nBefore going to sleep a few of us went out for a walk, leaving Mike behind. \n\nWe got back and everyone split off into there own rooms. I approached my room expecting Mike to be asleep. He wasn’t.\nI walked in on him masturbating on the bed with his face covered in clothing. After seeing the wardrobe door wide open, I realised that clothing on his face was the little sisters underwear.\nI pieced together the fact that while no one was around, he grabbed the little sisters underwear from her wardrobe and began to masturbate to the smell of it.\n\nJust from pure instinct, in the short moment of time I had the chance to record a decent amount of it. Which was wrong. But I didn’t end up showing anyone.\nAfter seeing I had recorded it, he ended up getting violent and assaulting me, forcing me to delete the video in front of him. I ended up doing so in order for him to stop.\n\nHe ended up doing it again with another one of my friends sisters and that’s when I realised it’s actually a pretty serious and disgusting behaviour.",
