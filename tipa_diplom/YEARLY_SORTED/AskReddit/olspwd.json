One day I walked down this path on my usual route (very little lighting) and usually when I walk down there there’s a bench across from a school that I would sit on now and again (just to take a break/ or scroll through my phone/ change my music) - so I was walking one and there’s 2 benches. Usually I sit at the first one but for whatever reason I said I’ll go and walk to second. Then when I got to the second I just hesitated. I don’t even know why. As I was about to sit I just jumped back up and was so confused. Then I suddenly felt really scared which was strange. Decided the carry on walking down the path and I didn’t even take 5 steps before I looked up as saw a shadowy figure of a guy over 6 ft. All I remember was him walking in my direction and then stopping when I noticed him. I couldn’t even make out his face he literally looked like a shadowy figure with a hood up. He didn’t even move but was facing me. I tried to calmly turn around and wanted to run but no way in hell did I want to get chased so I just tried to act natural. It look 5 mins before I was able to get to a well lit path. Some guys on their bikes were going down that route so I told them to watch out for some creepy guy and they said no worries we’ll be fine. When I finished talking, I noticed him walking towards me from behind the cars. Didn’t see him after that. Been over a year since I’ve been on a proper night walk lol. \n\nTLDR; saw slender man on a walk, now I don’t leave the house.",

We were getting late and I was putting my winter boots on, so I told her to start walking and that I'll catch up with her. Then I'm out the house and start walking off our  sidewalk towards her when I hear a metal clunk (which was her water bottle dropping to  the ground ) and look up to see her  running towards me screaming in fear. ( Ours is literally the  3rd house  from the beginning  of the street  corner where she was running away from). I also saw a white van right next to her, probably waiting to turn the corner.\n\nI merely caught a glimpse of two people inside the  van who had their window down?( But who would have their windows down during a  Canadian winter ? this is where I get confused because I saw this van round our street lots of times after that. I don't remember whether I saw them then or some other time)..... Anwyays, as soon as I caught up with her,  my sis told me how they asked her if she wanted to get in the van, at which she jumped, dropped her bottle and started running back towards me.\n\nI DON'T think it was a prank, because we (my sis and I) encountered the same van multiple times after  that, and it literally made rounds around our street as if trying to locate us ( we were watching from our porch).Our neighborhood even has a park watch for fucks sake  ...but It never occurred to me to report that. \n\n\n\nSeen creepier things, (like woman jumping out of her 6th floor balcony, to her death as an act of suicide) when I used to live in an apartment in  Toronto, but in the burbs this was the only thing I still remember.",

Then the guy just LITERALLY threw her in his car, took out his phone and took a picture of her. Then he got in as well and we saw movement through the windows.\n\nThe thing is that the parking lot was full of people who just stared and did absolutely nothing. Couple days later we saw news about a girl being raped. \n\nYou may be thinking why we didn't do anything. Well, the guy was pretty well built, and there was a good chance he had a knife or something. I doubt he was unarmed. If a whole parking lot full of grownups didn't even move a finger to try and do anything, why should we ? Forgot to mention we were all 19 at the time. We just didn't want to risk getting injured or worse over a complete stranger. I do feel bad about it. If I was in the same situation again, I'd definitely do something tho, because now I am older and I could probably do something, but back then, what could a bunch of 19 yo's do ?",

When I was a teenager, I lived alone and like I was a pretty weird kid and pretty mentally ill.  Went barefoot 99% of the time so I could save durrability in my shoes for the times shoes were required, never wore pants (because I wore skirts and dresses), and like was an incredibly silent walker.  And I was like on this weird idealogical quest for like natural purity or whatever.  So one night when I went for a walk in the towm arboritum, I came across this group of very loud rambunctious college men, and like for whatever reason I felt like they were disturbing the peace or whatever.  So I followed them for like 2 hours.  Always staying just out of sight maybe 60-80 meters away, moving nearly silently, but making may presence known by doing something freaky like howling every time I we were in an area that was echoy.  One time I remember even sneaking ahead of them to climb up a tree so they would pass right under me.  Dudes were freaked out, but the place was a maze unless you knew every one of the little trails and connectors which I did.  I imagine for the first 5 minutes they thought it was funmy and after that got more and more freaked out.\n\nI would like to say, please never do this to someone.  I was really not mentally healthy at the time and like I think they mostly went and laughed about it after, but I imagine this could like actually meas somebody up.  Also, like I have had a lot of head injuries, so I have very light sensitive eyes that basically give me better than low light vision than the trait in dnd.  Like I can see like 300 yards at reasonable detail at most light levels down to just before total darkness, so I don't recommend people with normal vision try to quietly clambor through trees with no light source.\n\n2) Less interesting but just as terrifying to me, one night I walked the block from my best friend's appartment (they later took me in if you were wondering how like the person above turned into a functioning adult.  I call them mom and brother now.) back to my car to get in and see something white tucked under the wiper.  Thinking it was a ticket, I got out to get it only to discover it was an instant print photo of an empty field, completely unlabled.  I spent the next month 100% convinced I was going to be murdered.",

I phoned the police and found out that night if you use the word “stab” they react a lot faster that usual. They found trails of blood dripping along the pavement and a bloody handprint on a car.

Obviously in some situation I have adrenaline, a guy 2am in Bulgaria-Sofia drifting on a road and shouting with a gun in the sky, I was the only one in the street, in one of the poorest part of the city. That was looking like a movie ahah  but I doesn't show I'm afraid, that the best way for going out of a weird situation for my part.\nIn Serbia I was in a very small town lost in the mountain, so walking again a night I see some weird guy looking at me, I'm OK I just do my way i don't give a fuck at some point 3guy start to following me and a car going backward on my side looking at me, I'm OK look very weird I start to walk faster, at one point the car block my way and the guy come to me. And start to showing me like a police plate looking fake and wanted me to go in the car I was like no way fuck you I do my thing and at lot of people start to come around me like 8-10 from fucking nowhere their house or whatever in the dark they were for just at one point a guy speaking English telling me they are from the police and want to know what a foreigner are doing here that the first one they saw here ahah.

As we got closer I realized he was walking two really big dogs, and he was holding both leashes in one hand while on the phone.\n\nAt about 50ft away a guy riding his bike goes past me and as he approaches the other dogs both of them pull loose and just go right for this bike rider.\n\nIn that moment I dropped my dogs leash, told him to stay - he is a very good pup and did so - and I had to go help the bike rider fight off these two dogs who had knocked him over and were looking ready to tear him to bits.\n\nThe whole time the fatass walking them was still on his phone just nonchalantly calling his dogs in a barely concerned tone. It was like he was content to let them have their way with this bike rider, and then just come back when they’d torn him apart. \n\nI took my shirt off and wrapped it around my forearm and basically had to do what I never ever wanted to do, I had to give a good smack to both of the dogs until the focused their attention on me, and then I basically sacrificed my arm as a chew toy. \n\nI screamed for the bike rider to go to go, and in his daze, bleeding pretty bad, I think he knew this was his one chance to go. He stumbles off sort of running with his bike.\n\nI start swearing at the fat lazy fuck on the phone. I was letting the dogs have my left arm, and working to try and grab their collars with him dominant right hand while trying to do an mma style mount onto their back. \n\nI eventually got over them, had their collars tight, and I just let my full weight down on them. I was able to half pin them. \n\nI was screaming at the guy more, telling him I’m going to call the cops unless he gets the leashes on, and I knew if I did the dogs would be put down, so I didn’t want to do it, but I felt it was the only thing that’d motivate him. \n\nHe eventually wobbles over and leashes them and starts to drag them away. I had to smack the first ones nose a few times to get him to release my arm, and then I had to try and pry the other one off.\n\nEventually they let go and he yanks them back.\n\nI screamed at him that he better get the fuck out of there or I was going to use every bit of strength I had left to restrain him until the cops arrived. \n\nHe eventually made his way off and i them stumble walk back to my lovely pup who was just sitting patiently. We jogged-stumbled back to my house where I then got a friend to drive me to the ER for stitches and a few shots.\n\nIn the end it all ended up ok, I guess, though I have no idea whether the bike rider was ok. I got my arm/wrist fixed, my pup was ok, and I didn’t have to call the cops and worry about the dogs being put down.\n\nIt took me a week or so to feel comfortable waking my dog again that late at night. We just walked in little circles around the block until I felt I was ready.\n\nI never saw either of them again. I no longer live there so I never will, and I pray that guy gets his shit together and trains his dogs. He should not have been allowed to own them.",

It must've been 2am and I had work the next day but walking at night, despite the dangers, always helped me clear my head and stabilize me emotionally. It was a crisp night and I was enjoying myself, bundled up in a thick hoodie and hat, when I noticed someone a few blocks ahead, walking towards me and waving...*something*. I decided that regardless of what it was, I'd keep walking and walk I did, slowly approaching the mysterious person. Honestly, if you've ever heard of the japanese urban legend *the kunekune* or \"wiggle wiggle\", it was kind of like that? Which sounds scary, but I kind of wish it was that instead. As I drew closer, the person passed under a light and, to my abject horror, I learned exactly what the person (a younger man) was swinging: a machete. Maybe I'm stupid or maybe I panicked, but I kept approaching, my mind racing as he started to take swings at the plants and trees looming slightly over the sidewalk. I did my best to just look forward and hope that I somehow slipped by unnoticed, but despite my best efforts at attaining chameleon like superpowers on the fly I heard him, as I passed by, address me. \n\n\"Oh, good evening.\"\n\nI didn't respond and, despite my fear, kept walking. Nothing happened and I wasn't brutally chopped to bits on the sidewalk, but I don't take as many nighttime walks nowadays.",

I was supposed to meet my wife out in town and since i didnt have a car a t the time, i waited for the transport to arrive. Here you catch the taxi near where said dark and scary road begins at the edge of my neighborhood, where there are street lights, but if you look out towards  where the road leads into town, it's pitch dark, except for the distant lights out in town. Anyways, I'm standing there, up against a wall, waiting for the next transpirt to come in, stating into the dark, when suddenly my ears are pounded with a really Loud Rumbling sound! I was in complete shock as my faculties tried to figure out what the flop was going on (earthquake?? A building falling over??) and scrambing to react to it. An instant later a friggin Full Grown Black Horse comes barreling from around the corner and gallops by within a couple of feet of where I was standing. The rumbling was the sound of it's hooves, I figured and i saw it gallop into the dark. I decided to call it a night and head back home after that.\n\nOn another occasion, also during the dark, but very early in the morning I left the house to go to work and went to the same spot to wait for the transport. This time, i left much earlier than usual, as my boss had requested that i should show up earlier than usual. As I neared the spot, i noticed a small thing stuck to the wall where I would wait to get picked up. The nearer I got, the more I slowed my pace, as it became clear that it looked like a small human head was stuck to the wall where I would've waited for my ride. Thankfully, it turned out to be just the head of a doll, you know, those baby dolls with a fabric body and a plastic head whose eyelids close when you lay them on their back. Still, it's kind of a bizarre situation. I stood there, in the dark, waiting for the taxi to pick me up, with this doll head looking at me, when I realized that since I'm going in to work much earlier, and the transport service doesn't start until later, that i would probably have to walk into town. So I went. The dark, two mile walk seems scary enough, but now I've got the image of that doll head sending me off to my doom stuck in my consciousness.",

When he prodded it, it made a groan that according to him did not sound human and when he got a better look, it didn't appear human either. He described it as a disfigured shapeless blob with something like a face that moved in a grotesque way. He didn't stay to find out more.\n\nTo be fair my grandad had just gotten off a rough and likely long shift at a coal mine, and he was also a very superstitious man.

So eventually I fall back asleep when the noises stop. Tell my coworkers about it next day, turns out we have 4 resident peacocks that roam the campus and often like to sleep on my building at night and what does there call sound like? A woman screaming.",

I was looking forward to have a beer and got a taxi from my hotel to a university area, close to that stadium of the 2002 World Cup. I met a russian student there and we were walking around, holding a beer and talking about life. Late in the night, I left her in her apartment, which was also close to that area. \n\nThing is, only the hotel taxi driver talked a bit of english. It was about 1am and the city was suddenly empty. I found a couple persons around and when I approached to ask for help to get a taxi, they didn’t know english. I opened my mobile to try a translator, but then I missed an important thing: I hadn’t activated my mobile network, I was internet off, so I couldn’t try to translate or see a map or something. I kept walking to see if I could find a taxi, but it was a ghost city at that moment. I went back to the place I bought the beer to ask for help and they just had closed. Dude, I was like: I’m screwed. All road signs were in Korean.\n\nI started walking towards a famous bridge that could be seen from far and walked a lot. Suddenly, a saw a taxi passing by and I jumped over it and asked for a run.\n\nThe driver was empty but didn’t speak english. For my luck I pointed to his GPS and zoomed out to show the hotel. My memory helped a lot to figure out where the hotel was, because his gps was all in Korean too. I placed a pin and he started following it. Man, being in a foreign country where nobody speaks English is very terrifying.",

We  never used to see anyone as we'd be out from around 10pm and head home around 7am.   \n\n\nOne night (morning?) we were following a path to the next field, this path could be accessed from a side road leading on to a fairly busy road. As we're walking along talking, we spot a set of headlights, we were fairly high at this point, so paranoia kicks in to full overdrive. We dive into a bush at the side of the path and watch in silence.   \n\n\nThis van pulls up under a bridge, three dodgy looking men get out and walk around to the back. They pull out a rolled carpet and dump it on the side of the path. They all then look around as if to make sure they hadn't been spotted (we were in full camo gear and blended in pretty well). After a few moments, they get back into the van and speed off back on to the road.   \n\n\nMe and my mate climb out of said bush and just look at each other. After a brief conversation we decided we was to chicken to go and check the carpet to see if it was a dead body. We didn't see anything in the news about a body, so I assume they were just fly tipping. Probably one of the scariest/weirdest moments of our lives.",

I swear I have seen a puma or a black Jaguar. It was basically out of the corner of my eye going at 75 MPH and it was huge. It didn't fit the description of any local wild life which was more odd. Some people even said there are people that own those kinds of animals so it was possible that it was one. Tons of animals almost getting hit by me because of the speed I go. Deer like eating flowers left in cemeteries. Also, when they get spooked they tend to basically run full fledged towards where ever the hell they came from.\n\nThese ones I have never talked about because I'm still not sure about them. I live near an Army base and I have seen in my best description I can is basically a drone (not lit up) and it shotting downward a rain of bullets. All this while the drone was going downward. It could have also been a firework going the wrong way, but this happened way more than once for me to think it was that. I have seen a missile test that basically lit up the bottom half of the sky and then it launched. This one happen a few times and ever time it is pants shittingly scary because at first you aren't expecting it. \n\nThis last one I'm less sure about since I live near an Army base and just hope it is something from them. It basically looked like it could have been a UFO. Typical strange movements, pausing in air, but this one out of nowhere just disappears midair. Still have no idea what it was.",

We’d smoked, of course but there’s was 1 joint between 5 of us, so in the grand scheme of things I’d had 1.5 puffs (it was also weak shit so whatevs). About 1/2 of a mile into this hike, our designated leader stopped dead in her tracks. We were all confused and asked her wtf was up. She told us there was some animal in front of us slightly off the trail. I looked past her pointing finger and sure enough, there were glowing eyes staring back at us (we had flashlights but it was just at the edge of where they reached). I’d say the eyes were at my shin length (I’m 5’6”) and didn’t look threatening so I was like, oh it’s a rabbit on its haunches. Others chimed in with things like deer, bobcat, mountain goat, etc., harmless things. I could barely see an outline of a body, but it looked bony, like a malnourished animal where you can count the ribs. Welp, as we were talking, the thing stands up. And up. And up. When the eyes were at about 8’ we ran outta there. It wasn’t a bear, the outline of a body we could see was bone thin and didn’t look like a predator. And I don’t think it went up a tree, the eye contact was consistent, unbreaking, and didnt shake like a tree would make it. We never went back to that trail and this never saw it again.

During the night, there’s hardly anyone on the roads around my house and besides the frogs croaking and crickets there’s not much noise. One summer night I was having extreme anxiety because of my current teenage romance. Because I was unable to sit still and felt like I was crawling out of my skin, I took my bike out on a warm, moonlight lit night in the early hours of the morning (like midnight or 1am.) That might sound crazy to a lot of people but I’ve lived here my entire life surrounded by those forests and cornfields. Long enough to feel very safe and at peace in the wilderness rather than on alert. This is feeling of safety in the wilderness was cut short this night *VERY* quickly. I was approaching a portion of the road that is no longer cornfield, but completely surrounded by dense forests. So much, that even the bright moonlight which lit up the surrounding landscapes didn’t breach the thicket and reach me. There’s a portion of this road that is alongside a hill with a clearing at the top. Essentially, from where I was stopped at the time, I could see the outline of the trees up above on the hill due to the moonlight from the road I was on down below. It was almost like the trees on top of the hill were like shadows against the backdrop of the moon. At this point I was catching my breath on the road because I was pedaling vigorously before. Thats when I heard branches snap. That’s not odd living in the forests, tons of little critters can make a loud racket. So I was alerted and a little startled but not freaking out. So I watched patiently. For a few minutes there was silence, I was about ready to leave when I saw a bipedal shadow of a figure sprint across one tree to another. Remember this is the middle of nowhere, at around midnight, in the forest alone at 16. Immediately I got goosebumps down every inch of my skin and a lump formed in my throat. My heart was racing so fast. I hopped on my bike and pedaled away as fast as I could. It is by far the strangest and creepiest thing I’ve ever experienced near my house in the woods.",

            "text": "The scariest uh?\n\nI might need to provide a little bit of background for the story to make sense but here it goes:\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I had a lot of trouble at home with my parents (the reason is not really important for this story) and I used to spend a lot of time walking around at night. It allowed me to relax and to get tired so I could get some 3 to 4 hours of sleep before I had to go to the university.\n\nI should also mentioned that, I used to play rugby. I wasn't the greatest player and I wasn't super buffed, but I had enough training and it was so well engrained in my brain that some times muscles sprung into action without me thinking. Put a pin on this thought\n\nAs I said before, I used to walk really light at night almost every day.\n\nPartially to forget the issues at home, partially because I couldn't sleep, and partially because I needed to walk my dog. I used to leave it until very late with the intent that my family wouldn't bother me about it. I used to take my dog out from 11pm right until 2am or 3 am.\n\nI had a Cocker Spaniel (not particularly big).\n\nAs you could imagine, I got to know the homeless around the suburb I lived in. I used to chat with them to kill some of the time before I could continue on my lonesome walks. I also \"knew\" some blokes who used to sell drugs, I never got close to them and they never crossed paths with me... it was a sort of implicit agreement of \"each to their own business\" sort of deal.\n\nAnyways, I was 19, walking at 2am in a really dark part of the suburb when I notice the blue and red light of a patrol coming about.\n\nI didn't think much about it, you used to see the patrols going around the blocks, checking those in the middle of the night, hoping to catch someone doing something wrong. I never feared them because I was just walking my dog.\n\nAs I continued walking towards the corner of the block, the patrol did the WOOP WOOP sound to get the attention of someone on the street and an officer yelled top of his lungs - *\"To the fucking ground!\"*\n\nI turned around, just to see two officers (a little bit overweight) running at me, with the intent to take me down. As one of the officers leaped to take me down, my muscles kicked in. My hand went to the back of his neck, pushing down enough to make him lose his balance and the officer dove straight onto concrete, eating dirt in the process.\n\nThe second officer tried to tackle me as well, but I outflanked him as well and he crashed onto a car near by. I asked - *\"What the hell is going on?\"*\n\nThe first officer pulled his gun out and pointed at me. I obviously froze, my dog was pulling the fucking chain watching the entire thing. He wanted to protect me (he was always a good boy) but I wanted to keep him away from these guys.\n\nThe second officer hits me with the gun on the back on my neck (I didn't see him coming). I don't know how that happened, but my legs shut off and I fell on my knees. The two officers were screaming at me, but after they hit me my senses were a little bit off. I do remember one of them screamed - *\"If we killed here we can say anything we want, you fucker. You came at us!\"*\n\nI remember my heart was pounding hard. I can't really say I was scared because I was more confused than anything else. I asked - *\"Why are you stopping me?\"* \\- but they didn't answer. Instead one of them started to kick me. The first time was on my ribs, the second time against my arm (again, rugby training kicking in) whilst the other officer punched me on the other side. My dog was barking and tried to bite one of the officers and then I heard a gun shot.\n\nI thought the officer had killed my dog because I heard him wimping... Almost at the same time a motorbike pulls in and the two officers stopped everything almost immediately. I looked up, and I see one of the drug dealers on his Suzuki Super Sport bike (I don't know what it was, I just knew it had a red R on a side). He had a glock gun pulled out, pointed at the officers, he was calmed and just said - *\"He is my mate. Do you have a problem with him?\"*\n\nOne of the officers immediately stood up straight and put his gun back showing his hands to the dealer. Then he said - *\"He attacked us.\"*\n\nThe dealer (which again, I have never talked to him before) told them - *\"That's bullshit, he doesn't do that.

Grab your dog.\"*\n\nI looked at the guy, then looked at the officers and thought it was better to take my chances with the dealer. Took my dog and walked close to the bike. He tells me to put the dog between me and his back and I get on the bike. He took off and left the officers behind. About two blocks from the place the guy tells me - *\"What was that about?\"*\n\nI shrugged and explained exactly this story.\n\nHe asked where to leave me and I asked him to leave me close to the shopping mall two blocks away from my unit.\n\nAs we arrived to the shopping mall, the guy checks my head, I had a cut, nothing to great but I was bleeding a little and tells me that I should be careful. That it is probably best to not walk that late for a few weeks. That the officers might have been frustrated and they wanted to \"vent off\" with anybody on the street.\n\nI asked him - *\"Why did you help me?\"*\n\nAnd the guy said - *\"What do you mean? I see you around all the time, you never told on me and you are friendly to the hobos. Did you know one of them is my uncle?\"*\n\nI didn't know what to say, so I just said - *\"Thanks\"* \\- and walked back home to get a shower and clean the cut. I checked my dog thoroughly trying to find a wound or anything but he was fine.\n\nI couldn't sleep the rest of the night. I guess I was lucky I received help from the most unexpected place ever.",

I'd grown up around this town, lived here for years, usually felt safe. My husband and myself were in a rough patch, he had gone to stay 2 and a half hours away with his mum for a bit and I was struggling a lot with my mental health, I had 2 friends come to stay with me to keep me company. I really needed some headspace so I took my phone and headphones and went for a walk to sit by a park I had been to frequently over the years, it was right by the sea so I sat and looked out over the ocean and put my music on, I was 22, I'm a 5ft 6 female and it was 10pm and dark. I sat for a while just listening to my music and then someone was coming along on a bike, I didn't think anything of it to start with but he slowed down going past me, looked back at me as he got past where I was and then he turned into the gates of the park I was near. I suddenly felt really afraid, I became aware there were stairs right behind where I was that came up from inside the park he had just entered and that he may come up behind me. I also remember I'm nowhere near any houses, at least close enough to hear if I shouted. And I also realized I was out of sight of the security cameras near the beach. I hopped down off the wall and unplugged my earphones, I realized this guy had now re-emerged from the park and was now pursuing me on the bike at a distance, just slowly cycling along watching me as I walked, I pulled my phone out and called my friend, my home was a minute away but I didn't want this person to follow me, I put my phone on speaker at full blast and my friend answered and I said loudly, I am being followed, I am (insert my location) please help, he told his brother what I'd said and his brother sprinted out of the house barefoot to try and get to me but he went the wrong way, so I gave an even more precise location to the first friend who had also left to find me, as he got to me he saw the guy lay his bike down and start approaching me stealthily on foot from behind. Then both of my friends located me and the guy redirected himself away and walked off, leaving his bike. My friends took me home and I broke down, I didn't even think to call the police because I just felt so stupid for putting myself at risk. I called my husband and told him what happened and the shock in hearing what I had just gone through reminded him how much he loves me and cares and he came home the next day. I've never been out alone after dark since, and I won't ever again.",

            "text": "Hohoho... today's my day (unless this gets buried, in which case, it's not my day) \n\nTL;DR...Ever heard a horny fox? Cuz I sure as fuck hadn't until one fateful night. \n\nBe me, on walkabout in suburban Midwestern USA.\n\nWhat should catch my ear on this dead-fucking-silent, sparsely lit evening, but the sounds of someones making the beast with two backs. I assume two humans were present, but I heard only one. Quiet human was clearly doing a good job, because I could hear human two from the sidewalk.\n\nThink of me what you will, but I didn't know what I was hearing at first. Even after forming my initial thesis of suburban sexy-time, I still can't quite believe it. After a few iterations of, \"that really is the sound of wildly enthusiastic coitus\", I finally reconcile this fact in my brain. So anyway, I've been standing still, listening to the ebb and flow of passionate moaning like a goddamn pervert for WAY too long, when I suddenly become KEENLY aware of these facts in evidence, i.e. I'm creepin'.\n\nNow I'm fucking ashamed, and ready to book it and finish my walk. No sooner do I doff my cap and begin a stride, than I hear the most unearthly, rasping, simultaneously high- and low-pitched shriek. It comes from the same direction of the boot knocking, but this is outside, and between me and the house. \n\nI freeze. Instantly, time dilates. Long-neglected primal instincts wake to spontaneously analyze the distance from me to this house is under 15ft. Whatever made this mind-rending shriek is close to me than that and I CAN'T FUCKING SEE IT. \n\nI'm still as stone, one leg cocked in the air, like my namesake on a GD grouse. It happens again, closer this time. \n\nI've never run so fast in my life. I made it to the corner, hearing my own footfalls, heartbeat in my ears, and successive shrieks moving away fast in the opposite direction. \n\nI made it home at a more controlled pace and fumbled with adrenaline deaden'd fingers into my outdoor camera app. First, I check the live feeds, we're clear. Then I look at the event logs. It heard the shrieks, but nothing on the cam. I'm certain I'm being hunted by a pervert-slaying banshee at this point. \n\nJust minutes before the sound, though, there's a motion alert. I call it up and watch a fox slink through the yard going on the direction of the sex-house. Like a jolt, I'm 6 again and my gramps is telling me about how he is gonna shoot the vixen in his backyard if she doesn't stop screaming into the night for some lovin'.\n\nA quick Google confirms that vixens (lady foxes) scream not dissimilarly to what I heard. I'll tell you what, though, hearing it at night in the dark from a stones throw away is not the same as a recording.\n\nFun extra though, got drunk with those neighbors sometime later at a neighborhood party. A different neighbor mentions the fox kits that live down the street, and the husband from the sex house gets this massive shit-eating grin on his face. His wife (who is tiny, quiet, and reserved, btw) turns a deep shade of red, cuz she knows what's about to leave this dude's mouth. \n\nHe says, \"*wife's name* brought that fox into the neighborhood. She does an amazing fox-call, everyplace we live ends up with one or two dens. She'll only do the call if she drinks enough tequila, though.\"\n\nI spit my fucking wine out. The joke passed with a polite chuckle from the assembled, clearly going over their heads. His wife clearly wanted to die of embarrassment. BUT, the guy then stared me down after my wine splutter, raised his glass, and winked.\n\nI will never have the courage to ask if he was acknowledging that I got the joke, or if he could see me standing in front of his house listening to them fox-bang like a supreme jackass that night.",

I’m walking back to where I’m staying (homeless, was living out of hostels, but you wouldn’t have known I was homeless from how I looked. I looked like the nerd I am, down to the canvas bag slung over one shoulder.) Nbd, they seem a bit creepy, but what are they gonna do, drop their nearly-new cigarettes to harass or follow me?\n\nApparently, yes, yes they would. \n\nOne guy drops his cig on the sidewalk and falls in behind me. Fine. Rude, but fine. He’s shorter than me and I can probably outrun him, so I just keep walking. \n\nThe next guy does the same, falling in behind him. \n\nAnd of course, now I’m like “fuck.” I’ve had enough experience to know what this is and why it’s happening. I hoped like hell they weren’t expecting me to be familiar with the terrain and started weaving my way through the neighborhood, crossing streets without waiting for residential traffic to stop, keeping an eye on these guys, noticing a couple of vehicles I had to deal with, hiding in shadows when I could, ducking down alleys, etc.\n\nLong story short, there were five men, two different vehicles, and I eventually scaled the side of a pier to hang out in a well-lit, non-kidnapping-conducive area until I could get a cab. (Yes, I reported what happened. The pier was a tourist attraction so there were security guards and such hanging around.) \n\nThey were good at it too, and had clearly done this before. It wasn’t the first time someone had tried to grab me, but it was definitely the most competent attempt to do so. The sort of chase where, had they not been actively trying to kidnap me, I’d have shaken their hands out of grudging respect for the level of skill and preparation involved. I BARELY made it out, and one of the vehicles getting stuck at an inopportune red light at the edge of the dimly-lit neighborhood was the only reason I ended up making a clean getaway. They got rather close to me a few times, maybe six or seven feet away. Being homeless and whatnot, I knew there were traffickers in the area, and I’d had a lot of run-ins, but these guys were BOLD. AS. FUCK.\n\nAll I’d wanted was to get back to my hostel and eat my shitty microwave meal in peace :(",

I actually had to meet a friend who stayed 350m from my house but in a different society. No worries right? The locality where we lived was pretty safe for 11 at night and I wasn't scared of anyone since I was quite tall for Mumbai standards (6'1 and 82kgs). So I go out to meet my friend 350m from my house and I see a big ass animal with a huge ass tail some 100m away from me on my way to her house. All my courage left my 15 yr old and I was scared shitless. I couldn't make out what animal it was but I surely knew that it was some wild animal. There were many cars parked around so I could hide behind them but my dumb 15 yr old ass ran back to my society premises coz I was scared. I later called my friend that I can't visit her coz of a mother fucking beast. The next day, the newspaper had a small section about a leopard coming out the forest reserve area and roaming into the urban complexes. Yeah so I didn't go out on walks at night for atleast the next 2 months after that",

They pushed for more, giving me a description of this Hayley. I said no again, and offered to ask the local police or something since they weren't from the area.\n\nThey left, but not really, they waited in a car that didn't belong on my street.\n\nHayley was my next door neighbour's daughter. So I was pretty pissed off that my address was used for some reason, but I wasn't going to tell two random assholes where she lived either.\n\nI looked outside the window from upstairs in the dark, they were parked outside. Left after maybe 15mins. I was ready to call the police if they hung about longer. I called hayley's dad about it since he was on a taxi shift. He didn't know them. Next day, both Hayley and he can't over to ask about it. Hayley feigned ignorance, claiming she didn't know them either. \n\nThe matter didn't go as far as that but I was mildly on alert for a couple of weeks since then. This happened before covid lockdown. \n\nEdit:\n\nAdditional info/conjecture\n\n- I'm friendly with the neighbour, he is a taxi driver and fixes cars so he looks at my car if I have a problem. I take his parcels when he's not in.\n\n- I am NOT friendly with Hayley. She's in her twenties, and pretty and blonde. Im polite to her but feels like anything more would come across as creepy. I'm not connected to her socially or anything further than Facebook. \n\nRest is conjecture - judging by what I know of her- she's a party girl, she does live it up a bit. That's not an issue. \n\nShe did have an ex boyfriend who are now not together. They had a kid together. It was messy in so far as they used to have massive screaming matches right outside the house. He seems like an asshole. Turns up in either a van (a builder) or an expensive looking BMW. \n\nI knew her ex from school- he was younger than me but a few years and was a bit of a dick. \n\nSo either he did something or she did something and brought shit onto my doorstep. He could most possibly be a dealer, but I'm biased and this is just conjecture, I have no proof and I'm not friends with Hayley for her to actually tell me. \n\nThe general vibe was that she dodged a bullet. Not literally, but those guys definitely was looking for her and not for a nice friendly chat. \n\nAnd yeah, if she was the one messing around pissing off random dudes, giving a fake address which is next door to the real one sounds pretty dumb. I'm not on bad terms with her in any way, so I don't think she would've done something like that to mess with me.",

            "text": "This one happened to me a few years ago when I was in my early 30s.  I live in a Southern California coastal town near a major university but close enough to wilderness areas that encounters with skunks, possums, and raccoons are a daily/nightly part of life. \n\nI  had a somewhat timid pitbull (a past housemate locked himself out of the house and had to break in...when he finally got back in, he found my dog hiding under a table crying) who sometimes demanded late night walks before bed.  Her favorite route was near my house around a large local park along a key thoroughfare between a shopping hub for the localcommunity and the university. The park is sporadically lit and home to critters and occasionally transients.  It's also, due to one of those weird flukes of weather and geography, always several degrees colder than the surrounding areas and sometimes home to spooky-ass ground fog. So on this particular fall evening a few years back, my dog and I were walking around the park at about 11:00pm. We approach one of the poorly lit sections of the park exterior, which has high bushes separating the sidewalk from the parking lot and/or park itself.  The bushes are right on the edge of the sidewalk and about arm's length in width.  All of a sudden my dog starts freaking out.  Like full on attack mode with deep barking and snarling.  This was completely out of nowhere - no rustling noises or anything else you would expect to evoke that kind of reaction - and totally uncharacteristic for her. \n\nTypically when she spotted a raccoon or skunk, she was more curious about the weird animal in front of her than anything else (or she would start loudly crying and embarrassing herself).  But she almost never flipped out.   I immediately yank her away from the bush and run down the sidewalk, thinking \"oh shit we're about to be skunked!\" After 25 yards or so, I turn around, pull out my pocket flashlight (dog still freaking out in the meantime), and shine it back toward the bush, expecting to see a critter saunter away slowly.  Instead, we see a man emerge from what I later found out was a hollowed out section of the bush on the other side of the sidewalk.  He very casually stood up and looked at us.  He looked to be in his late 30s/early 40s and was quite clearly not homeless.  He was dressed like a suburban dad (jeans and windbreaker) and appeared to be completely sober.  I remember noticing that he was wearing dress shoes and fixating on how out of place it seemed.\n\nA bit of background info: I am a big, big dude - somewhere in the ballpark of 6'8 320lbs -and I spent a number of years moonlighting as a bouncer at a local bar so I can spot a drunk pretty easily.  After the initial shock of what I was seeing wore off, I mustered my best scary bouncer voice and shouted \"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING\" while my dog was still going apeshit.  The guy took off running at a full sprint toward my neighborhood.  I called the police (there's a sheriff's substation at the shopping center less than a mile away) and explained what I had just seen.  For the rest of our walk, multiple police cars were patrolling the park and the neighborhood with spotlights shining the entire time.   \n\n\nFrom what I understand, they never found the guy.  I have no idea what he was doing in the bushes or what would have happened if somebody other than me and my dog had walked by.  The bush was uprooted a few years ago but I still think about it every time I walk on that side of the park.",

He just said \"I'm cool, I just need water.\" Luckily I was carrying a big bottle and so I just forked it over. Asked if I could call 911 for him, no. Anyone else, no. He just wanted water. \n\nSo, I left. I gave him the water bottle, and left my spare jacket in case he could jimmy some sort of foot covering with it.

It was ironically not unusual to spot or hear things you wouldn’t normally hear in the woods in this part of the country, such as mountain lions and wolves. In fact, our experts here said there was no way we had any of those, which we locals vehemently disagreed with (there is NO mixing up mountain lions and wolves with bobcats and coyotes).\n\nAnyway, my car had broken down a few months prior to this particular experience, so I was left hitching rides with coworkers or walking the 4 miles home, along winding roads that primarily wound through the woods. On one such night, I opted to take a trail my brother told me about, which was about halfway along the highway route home. I was pretty comfortable in the woods at night - the majority of wildlife living along the highway was deer, squirrels and other such small and (mostly) harmless critters, and up to that point I had never seen anything more concerning than certain varieties of snake, bobcats, and coyotes. \n\nWhen I had entered the woods, there was still a little light on the horizon, but that all but disappeared when I entered the tree line. I felt committed, so I continued on my way, staying alert and using my phone for light when needed.\n\nI had been walking for about 10 minutes when I got this feeling something was watching me. I stopped and listened closely, but the only thing I could hear was crickets and tree frogs. I walked a few more steps, and then every hair on my body stood up. I still don’t know what tipped me off, but I KNEW something wasn’t right, so I very slow pulled out my phone and turned on my flashlight. I shined it around me until I caught sight of a very large set of eyes. It only stayed for a couple seconds, but it was clear I was staring at a mountain lion (very distinctive facial features compared to a bobcat). \n\nI made myself as big and scary (or stupid) looking as I could and started screaming at the top of my lungs. It was gone by the time I started making noise, but it made me feel better knowing I was probably making it add distance between us.\n\nI ended up cutting through the woods back to the highway and stayed with that until I got home.\n\nIt was around this time people in the area had started reporting seeing a mountain lion, including my mom and then me again a few months later while taking my brother to his girlfriend’s house. \n\nI have several more stories I may have to tell on here sometime, this was fun.\n\n\n\ntl;dr I ran into a big as cat at night in the woods",

I can guarantee you this was not an animal. When we heard this we all started to run at full speed in the opposite direction, our only thoughts were to gtfo. As we were running I heard something running beside us and it was a fox. Now this thing that screamed could not have been this fox. But the terrifying part about this fox was that he was running right beside us, so whatever that noise came from caused scared him more than five rowdy teenagers running at full speed.\n\nWhen we reached the car we all had a moment of confusion, *wtf was that?*. But then I realized one of us was missing… Fuck.\n\nWe immediately sprinted back to get our friend, the one with the weak femur was still back there.

Well we grab him and take him back to the car since he was still pretty shook. \n\nI wish I can tell you we saw what it was or we went back, but tbh we are all too scared to go back lol, but whatever made that scream and whatever sent that fox running, it wasn’t anything like I’ve ever experienced.",

Instead of walking from my mom's, we took my car to the other side of the neighborhood and parked in an elementary school parking lot that is right next to a historical house and barn that sits on top of a hill and leads to a big field. We were out for while and decided to head back to the car around 11pm and when we got near the parking lot, we noticed a car parked literally right next to the passenger side of my car, in an otherwise large, empty parking lot, with it's lights on. I got a weird feeling about it, plus I had a backpack full of camera gear, so we walked passed to circle back around, hoping they'd be gone by the time we got back.  \n\nWe finally got back about 15-20 minutes later, but cut up the hill behind the house/barn just to stay out of sight, and they were still there with lights on. So, we just hung out behind the barn where we could see a reflection of their lights on the side of a trailor and smoked a cigarette, waiting to see what the fuck this person was doing. I just didn't feel right about it because by then, it had been sitting there for at least 30 minutes. And of course, we're going through all the reasons why someone would park right next to the only car in a big, empty parking lot at 11pm on a Wednesday night and none of them are good. \n\nFinally after about 40 minutes, we ended up calling my mom and having her pick us up down the street, so she could pull up on the other side of my car so I could just get out real quick, hop in my car and get the fuck. The car was still there by that time but only the front lights were on and the car has the darkest fucking tint ever, none of us could see inside.\n\nI don't know, it was just weird and maybe I was being really paranoid, but it weirded us both out because the only reasons I could think of were they were waiting to jump whoever came to the car and we had all my camera gear; they were waiting for a drug dealer; they were doing drugs; it was teenagers parking to have sex/do drugs, it was a cop; etc. Thankfully my mom also thought it was weird as fuck and barely waited for me to finish telling her what was going on before she said that she'd be right there.",

He was yelling something. We immediately went silent - still swinging fast back and forth too high to jump and too startled to try and kick the ground to make too much noise and draw attention.

YOU.”  \n\nYou know when someone says something and you know that they mean it? Like on an instinctive level?

Jumping in the car. Turning the key. The headlights flipped on automatically just in time to reveal a furious wild eyed man run full speed through the fence and literally slam his hands on the hood of the car screaming! \n\nAlready in reverse we hit the gas and sped backward up the country road leaving the man standing there loosing his mind. \n\n(Sorry for the long story.

We called our guy “on the outside” to come pick us up as it was getting late, we didn’t have anywhere to set up camp, and a storm was approaching. We hiked to the nearest exit point on the trail, met our pickup guy, and he drove us a few miles to the nearest campsite we were familiar with that we could basically drive up to. Long logging path pretty deep in the mountains that we had hiked to in previous years, so we were kinda familiar with the area. Anyways, we hop out of the van and it’s pitch black out. No moon, it’s April in the mountains and still pretty chilly. We’re cold, hungry, and exhausted. That’s when we notice this motherfucker staring at us from behind a tree. \n\nI know this sounds like a nosleep story but it’s 100% true and probably the most scared I’ve ever been. We notice this guy, no headlamp, no equipment, no backpack, just standing there. One of our group (former marine) yells at him to come out and explain what his deal is. This guy walks a few feet out from behind the tree and we all shine our lights on him, and I shit you not, this dude’s white t shirt is covered in what looks like blood smears. He’s pretty rough looking, long hair, long beard, crazy eyes, and he was wearing a (bloody?) t shirt and shorts in 35 degree weather at night. We’re all pretty freaked out, and this is a pretty experienced group of hikers who’ve seen some shit. We ask this guy what his deal is and he says we can’t camp here. We tell him that that’s exactly what we plan to do, and he says “I don’t think that’s a good idea for any of you.” \n\nWe kind of turn to discuss as a group and when we look back he’s hidden back behind the tree. As a group we basically decided none of us were getting any sleep that night if we stayed here, so we packed up the van and left. As we were pulling out, this guy pulled out one of those red-filtered flashlights and *ran* after our van. I’m not kidding, he followed us for at least a quarter mile on foot. He was fast as fuck. We passed a park ranger on the road and flagged him down to tell him how weird that dude was acting, and he said he’d go investigate. I didn’t hear anything about it again for 5 years. \n\nFor the longest time I thought he was probably some pot farmer who had a nearby plot, or a moonshiner who was just living in the woods and didn’t want us near his still. People hunt all the time out there, which would maybe explain the blood a little bit. \n\nBut I was recently at an event with some of those guys again for the first time in years and that creepy dude from the woods got brought up. One of them who still lives nearby broke out his phone and said “I forgot to tell you guys, I saw him again.” Pulls up a news article and there he was. So obviously the same guy. he’d been arrested for murdering some poor girl on the trail. Timelines didn’t match up, so I fully believe we saw this guy shortly after he’d murdered someone else. He hasn’t been charged with anything else as far as I’m aware. I’m not backpacking without a gun anymore.",

I couldn’t see very well, but I knew the area, & was walking along the road, which ran parallel to a small river. The moonlight would bounce of the water, & all you would hear is the trickle from the slow running river & slight breeze in the trees. I loved those walks. That was until the one night, in the dead silence & pitch black, I distinctly hear a mans voice out of the woods say very clearly: ‘Young girls shouldn’t go walking alone in the woods at night’. I FROZE. I looked in the direction of the voice & couldn’t see a damn thing. I RAN HOME. That was the last evening walk I took in that park.",

Grew up in the countryside, where the nearest streetlight was 10 miles away, so I’m comfortable in dark places, so much so that I often take my dog for a walk at around midnight just because I like the peace and quiet of the night. I live in a city now so something about the dark is just soothing to me.\n\nThat being said, one of the scariest things I’ve ever experienced, I genuinely have no explanation for. Living in a city I used to drive out 20-30 miles into the country to do some astrophotography. As I’m driving out one night I see this guy walking at the side of the road with no lights, reflectors and a big backpack. Didn’t think much of it other than it being a little odd. 5 miles later, I see the same guy walking again. I haven’t changed directions, turned, and I’ve been doing ~50mph. As I drove past he looked and waved at me. I was pretty spooked but I drove on. I must be imagining things. It can’t be the same guy.\n\nI get to my field in the middle of nowhere, park up and get the camera out, and turn off all the lights so my eyes adjust to the dark. All is going well, and for 30 minutes I’m content, and starting to relax.\n\nSuddenly I hear a rustling near the hedge by the road. Crunching leaves, grass being kicked. It was footsteps. I immediately get a feeling of dread, like I’m in severe danger and something bad was going to happen. I grab my camera, toss it in the car, get in, lock the doors and turn on the headlights. When I turn out of the field. I pass where I heard the noise and saw fresh footprints in the mud but no sign of anyone.\n\nI race back home, driving double the speed limit, constantly checking my mirrors for anyone. I park up around the corner and wait in the car with the lights off for 30 minutes, watching. Nothing shows up, I get home, lock all the doors and sleep with a knife under my pillow that night.\n\nI honestly don’t know what really happened that night but part of me knows that creepy guy I passed on the road twice was in that field.",

            "text": "Late one night I get a craving for some Hot Cheetos. So I take a late night stroll to acquire what I so craved. At the time I lived near a 711 that was right at the end of my block. My quest for hot cheetos that I would certainly regret the next day on the commode would be ranked: trivial in my quest log. \n\nI begin my journey by walking down the sidewalk that would lead me out to the main road where the 711 was located. From there it was only a short walk to the sanctum of the holy To's. \n\nI get about halfway down the roughly quarter mile stretch of pavement when I hear the sound of a dog barking. Not abnormal at all for the neighborhood. Dogs get to barking all the time at night where I lived. So I keep walking and I see the source of the barking. A silhouette of a large beast on the sidewalk in the distance. No owner in sight. A loose heathen of the night, thirsty for kibble and blood. Now, the huge animal didn't see the argonaut on his quest for snacks. So I calmly turn around and head back the way I came. I had an alternate route planned, but little did I know this obstacle would be mundane compared to what I would later face. \n\nMy alternate route was to take an alleyway, the opening of which was positioned across from where I lived. So I get to the opening and walk down the alley. The alley was right next to an apartment complex that I knew I could cut through to get to my destination. So I cut through the complex which was situated around a courtyard where the complexe's pool was held. I get through the courtyard and out of the complex onto the main road. \n\nI make it to holy ground of the sacred cheetos with it's green and orange hierogram blazing brightly above the parking lot. I acquire my prize for the low price of 1.99 and am filled with the glow of success. Quest completed. Or so I thought. I was wrong, fore before the end of one's quest one must face the final boss. \n\nI begin to walk down the street, not back the way I came, oh no, I had conquered that route. So I walked down another street that ran adjacent to the 711. My plan was to walk down this road to the opening of the alley way just before the opening to the end of my street which I knew was most likely still guarded by the raging hound. \n\nAs I am walking I begin to hear the sound of a cat meowing. Meow. Meow. Mrooowww. Uh oh. An angry feline stalking the late night traveller. So I look for the beast. Next to me was a low brick wall which separated a portion of the aforementioned apartment's parking lot from the sidewalk and the main road. I looked there first, figuring I'd see the prowling horror resting upon the wall ready to strike. But alas, there was no cat upon the divide. Yet the angry meowing continued. I knew if I didn't located the mouser with haste that I would soon feel the sting of it's claws. So I look to my right where there were two metal boxes which held power meters and wiring for local internet services. There I saw it. Dear reader, there was no cat. \n\nThere, crouched upon the concrete between the two boxes, was a large woman. A mimic. Her head poised up at me. Her hands splayed on the ground enshrouded by her considerable shadow. The mimic meowed again, loudly. A sound that said: no, you shall not pass through these parts, these lands are mine and only my magics hold power here. \n\nI slowly retreated, side stepping over the low dividing wall to my left, creating a gap between me and the horrible mimic of the night. Then I ran. Fear filled my heart as surely she would follow, running upon all fours as she took the shape of a demon or a dark wisp made of hatred and violent smoke. I reached the apartment's courtyard through a small gate and risked a quick glance back at my stalker. Nothing. She was not upon my heels. I was safe at last. \n\nI made the rest of the walk back to my humble home without issue. \n\nThat is the tale of my quest. Bards across the empire will surely sing it for years to come. \n\nTL;DR: I came across a mean looking escaped dog and a woman who was crouched on the ground meowing like an angry cat on one short walk to get a late night snack.",

A deep, protracted scream from my left suddenly distracted me from the audio book I was listening too and I removed my headphones. The scream swelled and was soon accompanied by fast approaching footsteps which quickly overtook me on the other side of the hedge. I stopped just as a bare-chested man erupted out of the foliage about five feet in front of me. His face and neck were covered in what appeared to be white powder from his nose down. For a brief moment we locked eyes - me frozen still, him wide-eyed and still screaming - then he rushed past me; off down the road, into the darkness. I was so stunned I just stood there for a few minutes, listening to his receding footsteps and screams as they faded to nothing, before replacing my headphones and continuing on my way. I still find myself wondering about that guy. Where was he going? Where had he been? How much of that powder had he ingested?",

Very rural area. It had to be at least 7-8 miles away from the house we were at and we were metal heads in jeans and boots. The reason we didn’t drive was because my car had a low fuel light on and no gas stations were open within range. We’re walking and just talking typical teenager shit and suddenly we hear the most evil deep sounding ferocious dog bark I’ve ever heard to this day. We turn to see this massive ass shadow galloping towards us. Nowhere to go. I told my friend quickly “whoever he gets the other jump on it and punch in the face” I had my fists balled up ready for the lunge of the dog. Right as the dog gets to the point of crossing the yard to the asphalt my friend yells “stop you son of a bitch or I’m gonna kill you!” And at that exact moment the dog stops on the white line of the road and just stares at us. We walk backwards facing the dog till we are out of range. Scary as hell adrenaline through the roof. We finally made it. Got our drink. Sat on the bleachers of our school baseball field (right next to the store) and talked for probably 30 min before heading back. The dog was nowhere to be found on the return trip. We actually had someone stop and offer us a ride when we were about 2 miles out from the house. The look in both of our eyes said we wanted to hop in the car as we had underestimated the effort this required, but we both agreed out of pride to turn down the ride and keep walking. We rolled back in the driveway and I immediately bailed and drove home on fumes to sleep in my own bed the rest of the night. \n\nThe dumb things teenagers do.

My friend and I look at each other, and I could tell she was genuinely scared. \n\nAs we're in the middle of the 'U', I tell my friend \"I don't know if they'll come back. Let's run.\"\nAs we approach the 2nd curve in the 'U', you can turn right and go down another road. It adds a few miles to the walk back to campus, but it's probably worth it.\n\nJust as we run out of the 'U' and we're behind another curve, I watched the same truck come back.

On this occasion, he did somthing I'd never ever seen him do: he layed down, getting his body as close to the ground as possible, and did this cry/growl thing that I'd never heard before. He locked on to somthing out in the dark, staring intently while he made these noises, and all of this started to creep me out. I spend a lot of time out in the dark woods by myself, so I'm just about as comfortable in the dark as in the daytime, so me creeper out is not normal. I shined my light out where my dogs nose was pointing, and BOOM, two golden eyes that seemed as big as dinner plates. Now, barn cats have yellow eyes. Bobcats have yellow eyes. Some dogs have yellow eyes. Mountain lions have golden eyes. There's a huge difference, and if you ever see one in the dark, you'll imeadiatly know what I'm talking about. I grabbed my dog, and started to walk back towards my house, about 600 yards. I'm not seriously worried at this point; I know how rare an attack is. The. The fucker started following me. It maintained the same distance away the entire way back to the house, then stopped just short of the pool of light. It never got more than 40 yards close to me or 70 yards away. It stalked me, and scared the shit outa me...",

We walked across town to his grandma's house, where she had a pond in her back yard with a perfect view of the stars. We make it to her house and start walking down the hill to the bank when we hear some footsteps. He said it was deer, but I thought it sounded to heavy to be deer. I turn on the flashlight to see a momma black bear with her cubs not even 5 feet in front of us. I could have touched her if I wanted. Cubs scampered up a tree, momma bear eyeing us down. Luckily she seemed just as shocked to see us as we were to see her. There was kind of an \"oh shit\" moment between the three of us where we all just looked at each other before realizing this was a baaaaaaaad situation. We backed away slowly, banging our oars against rocks to make some big noise. Momma bear stayed put, just watching us leave, and as soon as we made it to the driveway we turned around and booked it back to his house. That sobered us up damn quick.

Neither of us could run very fast, my pants were threatening to fall down and he was in six inch heels. \n\nThe strangest, and scariest part to me, was that this guy was making dolphin noises. This guy chased us down the alley, still obscuring his face, making dolphin noises at us. I’m not sure when we lost him, we ran straight home, not caring about the curfew anymore.

It's fun to run there because no one else does but I could see that people would come through the area because of the trash they'd leave behind.\n\nAnyways, one night I decided to run on this off-trail because it was a fairly bright night and I didn't run those trails after dark very often so it was a way of keeping things interesting.\n\nI was running further and further away from any roads, houses, or buildings and the trail was becoming darker because the trees were getting taller and denser and blocking the moon and city lights. \n\nBy this point, I was pretty much in my \"running zone\" and just focused on breathing and moving when I hit what felt like a dense fog. Immediately, the stench of death hit my nose and it was overwhelming. I've come across plenty of animal carcasses throughout the years and this was unlike that. An animal carcass' scent doesn't surprise you out of nowhere. On a night with no wind, the odor will permeate out from the corpse and it's something you'll notice well in advance before completely dominating all other scents around it.\n\nNeedless to say, I did not stick around to investigate any further and immediately turned around and ran back out onto more public property. I came back less than 24 hours later during the daytime to find out what that smell was but it had completely vanished. I walked even further down the trail than I had the night before to try and track down the smell.\n\nI moved out of that neighborhood a few years later and read an article about how a body had been found in the same woods I used to run in. It wasn't related in any way to the smell I encountered because of the difference in time frames but I always wondered if maybe I had come across a failed hiding spot that someone decided wasn't private enough.",

Living in Atlanta at the time, I got a new dog and would take her for late night walks.  I LOVE late night walks; around 3 AM you're the only one out and it feels like you're the last person on Earth.  \n\n\nWe had a dog park near our place, and so I got into the habit of taking our new puppy on very late night walks to the dog park...maybe a 15 minute walk through a neighborhood and then through a huge playground that had a soccer and baseball field.  Late at night we never ran into anybody, and while the dog park was closed officially I just went in anyway and let my little girl run around the empty park by herself.  \n\n\nSo maybe 15 minute walk to the dog park, maybe 30 minutes letting my pup run around, and then 15 minute walk back.  \n\n\nI'm a well-built guy with dreadlocks who wears chains and ripped up clothes; pretty scary looking individual, and so I am quite confident that anybody who sees me at night won't fuck with me.  I'm usually right.   \n\n\nI'm a dog trainer, and was training my little girl to walk off-leash, and so often during the walk (especially on the soccer field) I would let her off leash and let her run...throwing a tennis ball and trying to train her to bring it back to me.  \n\n\nNow the night in question :   \n\n\nIt had to be right around 2:30 AM...we did our usual walk to the dog park.  Cutting through the neighborhood (just like normal), then crossing the soccer and baseball fields on the playground (just like normal), not a soul in sight the entire time (just like normal); no traffic and only a few streetlights : most of the playground and fields are shadowed in darkness (just like normal).  \n\n\nWe walk the 15 minutes to the dog park, spend a half an hour there, and are returning back home.    \n\n\nGetting to the soccer field I suddenly realize my pupper isn't ahead of me anymore.  At this point she was off-leash and often she would fall behind to sniff things but never for long and generally she led the way during our walks.  But I realized she hasn't been in front of me for some time.  \n\n\nTurning around I see my pup standing on the edge of the soccer field, right at the edge of the circle of streetlight.  She has stopped following me and is staring at me...no, not at me, PAST me, in the direction I am going.  \n\n\nShe has never acted this way.    \n\n\nI turn and look ahead of me and there is just darkness (just like normal).  I can't see very far ahead anything except shadows, but I don't SEE anything.  So I call her to me.  \n\n\nShe does not move.  I start walking away from her, continuing deeper into the soccer field, and she stands completely still, staring into the darkness ahead of me.  \n\n\nI stop again and suddenly it hits me that something is wrong.  Very wrong.  I squint trying to look ahead and don't see anything, but there is so much darkness I realize something could be right near me and I might be looking right over it.  \n\n\nI suddenly feel this ripple of fear as I realize there could be anything or anybody in the darkness ahead of me : my little girl has refused to move forward, even calling her, and she is generally absolutely fearless.  She's not growling, but the way she's standing completely still indicates she is in a very high stress mode.  \n\n\nWithout preamble, I turn and walk back to her, and we walk away.  Still turning and looking behind me every couple of steps, I still see nothing, but once I pass her she suddenly starts moving again right by my side.  We take a very wide berth around the field (takes an extra 5 minutes) and head back home.  \n\n\nThe next night we passed through the same area and crossed the field in the darkness and my pup walked through unphased, just like she normally does...running across the field and chasing the ball I throw just like normal.  Like the night before never happened.\n\nTo this day I have no idea what was there, but I am certain it was something.  I still lay awake at night sometimes wondering exactly what the fuck it was.  The fact I couldn't see anything makes my mind go to crazy places...but it was absolutely something.  \n\n\nSorry for the lack of payoff, but this is something that has bothered me ever since and will until the day I die.  I now carry a knife with me on my nighttime walks.",

Obviously living in the boonies it seemed pretty safe to be walking around, so long as you were armed, because wild animals aren't fun. So there was this path cleared out near my house, it was really easy to get lost in and the path was overgrown in places, nothing paves.

So I'm wandering around these trails, my flashlight is dimming out so I decide I want to head home. The light goes out... while I'm standing at a fork in the path, I went left. It seemed like a good choice at the time. I keep walking down for about 10 minutes and I hear like some sort of screech singing and in the distance and I start noticing smoke through the thick foliage. I walk down a bit more off the path behind a tree and see about 10-20 adults standing around a decent sized fire. They're all holding hands and singing and there's all kinds of weird symbols pressed into the dirt. There was a hunting rifle and some wooden stakes(? I think they were stakes.) leaned up against a tree across the clearing. I noped the fuck out of there as quietly and quickly as possible, pocket knife in hand. I'm smacking my flashlight until it flickers on and HAULING my scrawny ass home. It looked like something straight out of a horror film. Went back with a few friends the next day and there were the remains of a fire, but no symbols (it had rained a bit before we went).

Crouching down slightly, arms wide, shuffling rapidly forward foot to foot: as if prepping to break into a lunge or a run. I was pretty spooked by this point since it felt like they'd crossed for me specifically and I'd lost sight of the other guy in arm's reach just over my left shoulder but something about this guy's Intimidate Dance seemed... strange to me.\n\nCouple that with my nervous response being to laugh, and I just opened my mouth wide in a weird, silent grin. I didn't have the presence to actually laugh, just froze in this grim open smile. The guy doing the Intimidation Dance got up within a foot of my face and barked a strange fake laugh (AH-HAR-HAR-har!) and then both of them mercifully kept walking.\n\nI'm sure from an external perspective it was all very mundane, but I still spent the next couple minutes heart thumping and thinking *what the FUCK was that?*",

Firstly, I was like 8 when pokemon came out and I was a massive fan as a kid and secondly, the idea of a gps based game seemed really cool. At the time, I was my fathers carer, so I didn't get a lot of time to myself. That is until the early hours of the morning.  \n\n\nI'd typically leave washing up untill my dad went to sleep. I'd fill the bowl, let things soak for a bit while I went for a quick walk.  \n\n\nNear my house there were two pokestops. One was in a small wood, the other was about a 5 minute walk away along a path.  \n\n\nSo I would go into the woods and get the stop, then I'd walk the path to get the other, then I'd walk back to the woods, by that point the pokestop would refresh. I'd repeat over and over again.  \n\n\nThere was a particular day where I had walked back into the woods, It was pitch black and 3am, just after I got the stop, from about waist height to my left I very clearly heard a voice that sounded like it came from a cheap radio say \"Please, help me\".  \n\n\nMy phone had a flashlight feature which I turned on thinking \"It's early saturday morning, maybe someone came from a local pub and hurt themselves\". I turn on the flashlight, look around and I'm all alone.  \n\n\nI walk back and forth, looking for this person, however I was the only person in that area.

Down the path he saw a woman jogging, something that happens all the time early in parks, and told her she should go another way. He said that guy just seemed bad.\n\nSecondly, one of the craziest things I have ever been told. One night as hie was riding through the same park he said he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up, and he looked over, into the trees that surround the path, and he saw a man, dressed in brown, with antlers on his head.

I put my head down and kept walking, confidently, to give the “no fear,” appearance. I look up again and the same figure is there - now closer but in the exact same pose.   Look down again.

They were a pretty effective team. \n\nI thought they were just sorta playful and energetic backyard escapists when they first approached me but they continued to get more aggressive the more I pushed back. I may have squared one in the nose and it didn't blink. That's when I got  really scared and the truck arrived seconds later.\n\nNow that I'm older thinking back I'm fairly certain they were industrial guard dogs that got out of some place. Probably good doggos doing their jobs but just in the wrong residential place.",

We stopped in our tracks and decided to head back. As we were walking back the coyote sounded slightly closer and we then heard another on the left side. We were teenage girls assuming we'd be eaten alive because it got loud and definitely closer over time. It felt like forever while we kept trying to make noise and shine our phone lights twords the sound. Maybe dumb looking back.\n\nBy the time we got to her driveway we had heard 5 DIFFERENT COYOTES all in the surrounding area sounding like what I can only describe as closing in on us. We never ended up seeing any of them, but her dog lost his marbles (they had the electric, invisible fence for the dog) when we got back.

After a while we turned around and walked back, stopping by the local convenience store for water. The restaurant next door had some sort of heavy party going on, smelled pretty strongly of weed and was very loud. We made some comments about it, went to get our water and on the way out the commotion had grown like ten-fold. We kind of hang around outside the fence to watch but I’m like “hey, why don’t we at least cross the street” a few folks agreed so we went and I’m glad we did because as we got onto the sidewalk, we turn to see tow women running, yelling, followed by three gunshots and a security guard hitting the pavement. I spent my whole life in this town that straddled the line between the big city and the suburbs and had a decent bit of crime depending on what street you were on (the segregation in Atlanta is still super apparent), but it wasn’t until I went to Colonial fucking Williamsburg that I’d ever actually seen a gun fired irl. So yeah, my very first weekend in college I watched a dude get shot, and boy oh boy did that set the mood for the next 4 years",

Because of where he was in relation to the street lamp and the fact he was wearing a hood, his face was completely covered in shadow. But there was no doubt that he was staring directly at me. I kept moving forward but for some reason I couldn't look away as we passed each other. My face had contorted into a look of terror and it felt like my gut had squeezed itself into the size of a softball and my heart was getting ready to beat its way out of my chest and take off running down the street.

When we reached the street the truck turned down, we saw they turned around again and were heading back towards us (we knew it was the truck because it had this row of lights on top of the cab) and we ran faster and hid behind this trailer parked in an otherwise empty, small parking lot. The truck got back into the main road and drove off. We ran to her house, which was only a couple buildings down from the trailer, and ran into the backyard because we were afraid the truck would drive past as we were going through her front door and see where one of us lived. We peeked around the corner and sure enough, the truck drove past again but as soon as it disappeared, we ran into the house from the side door. We didn't go back out that night and I slept over so we don't know if the truck drove past again or not.",

One day I woke up extremely early, like 4 am early, and on this particular day I was feeling motivated to get my life together and start exercising. I had recently learned about these running tracks that had sounds of zombies chasing you so it would help you stay motivated and I wanted to try them out (mistake #1), I also thought it would be a great idea to get really baked before hand (mistake #2), and to also go out while it was still pitch black outside (mistake #3). So at first everything was fine, the track had some nice forest sounds with the zombies being very distant at first, my pace was good, and everything seemed to be going alright, until the actual zombie sounds started kicking in. They did an amazing job at making those sounds be super realistic and super close, so much so that I started freaking out and just full on sprinting as fast as I could. After about 5 minutes of this I finally have the realization that I could just take my headphones off or just change the track, which I do at an ungodly speed. Finally things seemed to have settled down a bit and I was feeling a bit more calm until I realized I ran directly onto the darkest road possible. There were no streetlights, not road lights, and the only lights you could see were distant lights on people porches, that’s it. \nTwo thoughts crossed my head, first, holy shit it’s so dark I can barely see where I’m going, and two, slender man was somewhere out there and he was coming straight for me. Those two thoughts combined sent my anxiety into a frenzy and I ran faster than I’ve ever ran in my life. I didn’t even run back home, I just kept running until I saw the first gas station and went right inside. At this point it was dawn and I was too worn out to even walk back so I ended up calling someone to pick me up and take me home. \n\nBut what did I see you ask? My life flash before my eyes for the whole time I was deep in a panic state",

I was on my own so I turned on mind my own business mode. I turn the corner onto a main street (still in the shady part of town) and half way down the block a cop car slams on his brakes and yells at me \"HAVE YOU SEEN A DUDE IN A ONE PIECE WEARING JASON MASK WITH A MACHETE!?!\". I was still used to having to deal with curfew and felt like I was doing something wrong just being out so late on foot. It was also so unusual and sudden I asked him to repeat himself.  So he yells the same thing again. After looking confused I yelled \"No, sorry\" and he floors it and turns the corner. The second he floored it everything clicked and my jaw hit the floor.

I remain in this panicked state, gun at the ready, until the sun comes up. The screeching has since faded away. A blanket of snow helps me see through the woods more clearly. Nothing is there, the screeching has been silent for a little while. Finally I settle down and plop myself down on a log, utterly exhausted. I pull out my phone and Google something like \"freaky animal noises\" or whatever.

At night time, I liked biking there on the new road, because since nobody lived there yet, I didn't have to worry about encountering cars or people. At least, that's what I thought.\n\nI was biking there around 2am (I'm a night person) when  I suddenly was illuminated in headlights. I took out my earbuds and was surprised to see a car approaching me. A guy was leaning out the window and shouted something, but I couldn't tell what he said.\n\nI'm a small asian girl so obviously I was suspicious of a group of guys approaching me. I biked to the nearest shelter-- a home half-way built, turned off my bike lights, and hid inside.\n\nThe car pulled up outside the house. I peeked around the wall I was hiding behind and saw the guys get out of the car, shouting to each other. One of them pointed at my bike discarded near the house, but they made no move to get it. Two of them got out their phones and turned on their flashlights. I couldn't understand what they were saying. It was a language I didn't know. \n\nThe guys approached the house and were looking around. I moved around the wall so that when they checked there, I was on the opposite side. The men didn't look very closely, luckily, and they went back outside the house and walked to the back. I decided that it was my best chance and jumped out a hole where a window was set to be. I picked up my bike and started riding away quick as I could and hid again in a different house. I watched the guys finish searching, get in their car, and leave from my hiding spot. The drove slowly around the remainder of the neighborhood and disappeared. \n\nIt was dark, so I never got a good look at them... But I feel like they were up to no good.

But my first apartment was in a very nice residential area and I used to walk almost nightly, whether for Pokémon GO or just some air. \n\nOne night I’m walking down a street I often did, looking at all the nice things on peoples porches and nice cars outside their houses. A red hatchback-looking car’s (that I only remember so specifically because of this situation) door flew open up ahead of me, with the front of the car facing the same way as me, so I could see the interior of the door. There was enough street and porch light that I could see there was no passenger. I immediately thought it was weird and came to a quick-second conclusion that the driver had opened it from his/her side for whatever reason. I couldn’t see a driver because the back seat had a drum set stacked up in the back. \nNow I play music so I’m thinking “oh neat, maybe coming back from a local show! I’m a somewhat confrontational person and I walk around here all the time, maybe I can come across as not creepy in the middle of the night and ask you about your band or at least about the drum set in general!”\n\nI have about 10 seconds worth of walking before I would walk past the car, but at this point I’ve heard nothing since the passenger door opened.  I finally walk past the car…\n\nNo driver. Now I stop, at this point I’m kinda freaked in combination with the passenger door opening and now hearing or seeing nothing for like a whole 60 seconds, and I’m less that ten feet from the car. I think maybe wind, but nope, clear summer night. Maybe I’m being pranked, people know I walk. I think maybe someone’s under the car, there’s no where else to hide since they’re the only car or even object in their surrounding spot. No mailboxes, bushes, trash cans, or other cars near them for me to have missed anything, especially with porch and street lights. But no one under the car when I look down. \nNow I really was scared and also in fear of looking weird myself. Standing in the street staring at peoples cars and looking under them doesn’t bode well I’m sure, especially when you’re the only moving shadow. \n\nSo I walked a little faster and thinking it through 5 years later, I still don’t know what the fuck happened. I absolutely watched a car door fly open, heard it and all. No movement and not a single other noise in this very quiet neighborhood. No hiding in the car, I’ve packed my fair share of drums in a car, there just wasn’t room. \n\nI can’t describe the quietness in those nice neighborhoods, but I’m sure many of you know what I mean. Somebody opening a front door, taking their trash out, anything… you hear it, and you notice it. \nThat car broke the silence of that quietness, and immediately had my full attention. I can tell you all with whatever internet trust you have, no one slipped by me. This door just opened. \nAnd there was no one. \n\nSame car was there until after I moved, though with no drums the next time I saw it a few days after that night. \n\nNever saw anyone come in or out that car or house in the time I walked by it those nights.",

Now since I was in the “no-go zone,” no one really looked for me, and after hiding there around 20 odd minutes, I decided to go back to the part where we were playing, and I slowly walked past a home that had a window open, and I saw some moment. I slowed down and stopped to see what’s going on and I saw a small girl (perhaps 5-6yo) sitting against a wall, and was crying, a woman was dancing, for some reason no music was being played. It was so weird, I fucking ran away from there, and the next morning told this to my uncle, who scolded for that and asked me to keep it to myself (if I can). Super weird stuff.",

It gets to 115+ in the summers so I like to go on long walks by moonlight in the early hours of the morning out in the desert. I was at least 6 miles outside of town when this happened. I know, it's not the smartest but I kinda like being alone out there. It kinda makes me feel a little more alive in a primal way.\n\nAnyway a few weeks ago I was out there doing my thing, when I hear a screeching noise. Like an inhuman high pitched whining scream that slowly increased in pitch and volume. The source was within 10 or 15 yards. I fumbled around to turn on my phone's flash light just in time to see a something's leg disappear into the brush. \n\nIt was like that scene in signs in the corn field where mel Gibson's character shines his light around just in time to see the the aliens foot disappear into the corn.\n\nI don't know what it was. I assume it was a tweaker or something because I can't think of any animals in the area that sound like that. If it was a human though, they would have had to be scrambling on all fours to be able to disappear into the sage brush like that. Needless to stay I didn't stick around to find out exactly what it was.\n\nThis was in Washington county, Utah if anybody has an idea of what it might have been.

It was a bright white light that lit up every single window evenly. The house sits on a corner of a T-intersection in a small neighborhood. There were no cars passing by and nothing across the street lit up. There was also nothing out of the ordinary after that (like something mysterious happening to the residents in the house). To this day, it remains the one thing that creeps me out. Probably does have an explination, but I've never been able to figure it out.\n\nA beautiful, but really weird one that happened was having lightning shooting off at all four compass points. Yet, right above me, was perfectly clear sky and a half moon. It was an incredible sight, especially since there were some huge bolts to the south. Just a few steps before I turned onto my street, it started pouring like crazy. I could hear the rain coming towards me, too.\n\nThe aurora scared me. It's rare to get the auroras in western Washington. A very dim green light was warping the sky, and looked like it was swirling in a circle right above me. Again, by the time I got home, it was clear enough for me to realize that it was the auroras. They were swirling and shimmering a dim blue and green, and it was so beautiful. I woke my mom up and we stood outside and watched them until they faded back out.\n\nOn the other side of the corner that had the house light up, there was a massive explosion. I just about jumped a mile high. I know that somebody that lived there was a pot smoker so I assumed it might have been something they were fiddling with, but the house was dark. I waited around to make sure there was no fire or cries for help, but it was dead silent after that. After about 10 minutes or so I just kept walking home. Never did figure out what happened.\n\nI miss those walks... they were super relaxing and a great way to just wind down.",

But at the same time, I want it to happen again. Here's the story:\n\nI've been at my grandma's house for the past 2 days. She lives in a fairly wooded area with only a few houses around her. There's this asphalt road that is right next to a creepy looking forest, and it's usually pretty deserted. So, of course, being the loner I am, I walked down the road alone at 7:30 PM, like 10 minutes ago. The road ends abruptly at a col-de-sac (SP?) where there's a few houses and a lake. So I was walking down the road with a towel, and I saw some deer, and it was cool, until I had to turn around and come back. After like 10 yards of walking back, I see a deer at the edge of the road. We gave each other the death stare for a while, until I backed away o show I meant no harm. It then looked off into the forest in front of it, turned around, and ran.\n    I thought that was pretty weird, and of course the main thought in my head was: \"I wonder if I get to see Slendy!!!\" but I kept walking. A little after that, I looked into the trees. Since it was dusk, everything had sort of a grayish tint to it. But something seemed off color in the woods. There was something darker next to a pine tree. I looked really hard, then realized what it was. It had no face and was wearing a suit. SLENDY!\n    I flipped my chiz. I turned around and jogged back to the col-de-sac. Here was my mind: \"OH MY GOD IT'S SLENDY WHAT DO I DO I CAN'T JUST WALK PAST HIM HE'LL KILL ME HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET HOME?????\" \n    Eventually I walked slowly past where he was and saw nobody there. The blackish tint was gone and all that remained was a boring gray. But, I began to hear footsteps behind me. I didn't dare turn around, and quickened my pace. Eventually I broke out into a run, the footsteps still behind me. I ran back to my grandma's house, then got some ice cream and hid in the closet with my laptop.”\n\nSo this actually happened, but looking back it was probably a tree. My grandparents live in a heavily wooded retirement community where the most dangerous thing is old Republicans with shotguns. Honestly, I needed an excuse to share this because it makes me cringe so hard.",

There's a wooded area at the end of the street guarded by a thicket maybe 5 feet high, pretty dense.  I realize there is, strangely, no other sound.  This area is not that deserted, it's not far from town.  It should not be this quiet.  \n  \nI hear more snapping of branches from down the street, coming from the woods beyond the thicket.  It's an eerie sound in an otherwise deep and silent night.  Each snap is a distinct thunk like a heavy footstep snapping a small limb on the ground, in slow, regular  repetition, loud, but short, like the night is swallowing any echo.  And it's coming closer?  \n  \nI'm starting to get a little freaked out now.  What the fuck?  There aren't any bears in this area.  Are there?  Mountain lions?  \n  \nThe snapping and crunching sounds continue.  Is that thing breaking fucking **limbs**?  Each snap sounds like it's somehow intentionally loud, like it's a message, and as the only apparent living thing, I feel, perhaps irrationally, like it's a message directed at *me*.  Like a warning.  Or a threat.  \n  \nIt's definitely coming closer now, but I don't move.  I feel transfixed at this point, like I'm meant somehow to find out what is coming.  This isn't the kind of warning that scares you away, it's the kind that only becomes clear in retrospect but at the time only seems like the march of inevitable fate.  The sound cracks through the air carrying the power of the night itself, commanding the darkness and the silence to bear witness.  \n  \nIt's right on the other side of the thicket now.  Now the snapping is accompanied by more crunching of underbrush.  We are approaching the moment after which it will have been too late to run, and people will wonder, *what was he waiting for*?  I realize suddenly I am most definitely going to be running soon.  \n  \nFinally, I see movement.  The brush rustles for a moment, and then... \n  \nA fuckin honeybadger comes out and waddles his stupid little ass down the street.",

He had a camper/trailer torture room where he would bring younger women. iirc he would rape, torture, and dismember these women repeatedly until they would succumb from their injuries.

I turned my light on and as soon as I did a loud scream happened. Like a little girl screaming in a megaphone. Again, I don't scare easily but the hair all over my body stood on end and my knees began to shake. I don't believe in the Blair witch, but this is some Blair witch shit. I scrounge up enough courage to open the tent and peer out and I see a bright yellow set of eyes staring back at me.

I yelled get out of here and threw whatever I could find, literally anything as I couldn't think correctly.

The fact was unlike anything I'd ever seen- it's like someone skinned the left side of it's face off or it's was torn off because it was hanging off by a good 6 or 7 inches on one side, and the skull muscle and bone was showing where I assume there was once an eye. \n\nI can say without shame that I full on pissed my pants.

            "text": "Holy shit, something I can actually answer. So......\n\nOne Saturday night, I was staying the night at one of my friends. At the time we were both 16, We walked around a bit in our small rural town and decided we'd go to our high school and hang out there for a bit. When we got to the school everything was pretty normal so we got board really quickly. I don't know what we expected to be honest. Eventually we left the school through the side  entrance beside the school pool. As we left the school we went out onto that same street where we kept looking at the streetlights as they kept flickering. We looked down the street towards the pool when suddenly all the lights in the outdoor pool turned off as well as the three streetlights closest to us. We looked around kinda freaked out yet thrilled. Then suddenly out of the corner of my eye I saw something move by the left window of the girls changing room. I knew it was a window because even in the dark I could see the reflection of the diving board, clear as. I pointed towards the window and whispered \" There's something by that window\". As we both looked longer and harder I shit you not, I slowly saw the window turn into the black shadow/outline of a man. I knew I wasn't hallucinating because my friend saw it too so we decided to keep it cool and just leave because honestly we were getting a bit scared, so we left after looking at the man for a good minute. We walked around the block and went back past the pool where we still saw the man standing there so we bolted back the way we came and decided to go back home and stay there. Thing is, that's not the scary part, scary bit is; When we went back to school on the Monday we walked into school via the pool area and looked at the changing rooms. When we saw this we shit ourselves. Not only was man gone (as you'd expect) but there wasn't even a window on the changing rooms at all, and we knew for a fact that we saw one. After that we only sometimes went to the school at night, but we never again went out the pool exit. I don't really have that much proof on this and I don't really expect anyone to believe us, but I know what we saw and I'm never going to go near there any night again.\nTldr: saw a window at the school pool that turned into a man then the next day there wasn't even a window there.",

We were heading back home, my sister biking behind me. We were about 3 or 4 streets from ours. I suddenly hear kids voices yelling, “get them! go and catch them!’ I hear multiple people running really fast behind us. I can also hear the crackly staticky noise from a walkie talkie, which they used the whole time they were chasing us to communicate to each other where we were. \nI can see them behind us and there’s about 7 boys older and younger than us running right for us. \nAt this point I’m shaking and scared as hell. I yell at my sister to go as fast as she can. They chase us for about a block yelling and screaming, before my sisters pant legs get stuck in the chain on her bike. We are about 2 streets from ours. I stop and try to get her free but I’m shaking and crying at this point, I’m so scared. My sister is also crying hysterically. \nThe gang of boys round the corner and catch up to us. They stop and surround my sister and I and we are both full on crying a this point. \nThe oldest boy looks at me and then at one of the other boys in disgust and then hesitantly asks me, ”...do you want to get raped?” I say no. He asks again, “ do you want to get raped? Are you sure?” Ha asks me a few more times and I answer no each time. I’m looking at my sister out the corner of my eye the whole time and the other boy that was given that look before is helping my sisters pant leg out of the bike chain. He rolls it up all the way to the top of her thigh. The older one from before snatches my bike and says, “well if you won’t let me rape you can I have your bike?” I answer no again. They all just stand there in silence for what feels like ages but was probably only a few seconds and the boy that rolled my sisters pant leg up says, “just let them go.” I snatch my bike back and my sister and I speed off home. I can hear some of the other boys protesting and getting upset at their friend behind us. \n\nWe get home and I’m crying hysterically to my mum and tell her what happened. Her ex husband calls the non emergency police number was called and we don’t hear anything from the police until over a year later. \nMy mother would later make fun of me or bring it up to humiliate me in front of people for crying about this throughout the rest of the time I was in contact with her.

Anybody who’s fished out there at night can tell you it gets stupid dark. Especially a really rural area near Rivera that doesn’t have piers.  The three of us are sitting on my buddy’s tailgate, directly ahead of us is the water, to our back’s is a thick brush line that’s near impossible to walk through.\n\nIt’s well past midnight, so we each wear head lamps to have some sort of light. I look to our right into the darkness near the shore, and I see someone walking in the water. The water we’re fishing isn’t so deep, maybe a foot or two. I turn my head back forward and switch off my light, so as to not tip them off that I’m aware of their presence. I keep quiet to not freak my friends out, but immediately look back to keep an eye on the stranger. \n\nJusssst barely I can make out their silhouette, they’re probably a hundred feet or so away from us in the water walking directly to the shore. They’re moving fairly slow, but deliberately, almost like this isn’t a strange thing for them to be doing at that time of day. They get to the shore, and without skipping a beat they keep on walking into the brush line and out into the wilderness.\n\nFinally, I’m like “Yo, I just saw someone walk out of the water into the trees.” My friends are skeptical, but I try to play it cool. We wait maybe five minutes, to give space between ourselves and the stranger. Then we walk over to where they came out of the water. Thankfully, I’m not crazy. We found fresh boot marks in the sand exactly where I said I saw them. We look into the trees and they don’t seem disturbed at all. The real freaky part is, we saw a TON of older looking boot marks in the sand. As if this was a normal thing that person, and maybe their friends, were doing.\n\nWe asked around, and the only real response people in the area could give us was that it was likely illegal immigrants just making their way into the country. Needless to say, we never fished that area again lmao.",

Now there's this one spot where 2 of the street lights are out, which is why it's *usually* one of my favorite spots because I can see the stars.\n\nHowever, a few weeks ago, I was coming up on that 40ish foot stretch of darkness and I saw someone walking from the opposite direction. Now let me be clear, I have walked this little route between 1:30 am and 3:45 am for months. In all that time, I've encountered a total of 5 people out that late and half of them were just far enough into the grassy area to let their dogs out. That's it. No one else for *months*\n\nSo this person is coming my way from the other direction and I knew I had to walk past them and started to get anxious. I deal with social anxiety, so I thought it was just my normal uneasiness. But as they got closer, I had this feeling that just turned from anxiousness to some kind of silent alarm going off in my body. It was almost like a sinister energy, as dramatic and exagferative as that sounds. But I have no other word to describe it.\n\nNow I had no intention of making eye contact with this dude, but at the last second as we were maybe 5ish feet away, he locked eyes with me. And I mean seriously locked eyes, I almost physically recoiled from how intense his eyes were. I looked away first (obviously) and he passed me and that was that. But there was just something about this dude. He wasn't some big scary looking dude or some creepy lookin guy. He looked like your average guy in his late 20s. But there was something about the way he walked and the way he locked eyes with me, that just felt so off. Like he just got done or was on his way to kill someone. Of course, that's just speculation, but I've only been this put off by someone a few times.",

Much of the area I typically work involves military training at any hour. I once got spooked by a dude who walked up on me and I didn't realize until he said, \"oops, you're not the checkpoint.\" The roads are typically sand, so you can creep right up on someone in silence, especially with all the wildlife noise at night. Sometime later that same season, I was off the beaten path at a relatively remote point, listening for these frogs. I hear clear footsteps on the opposite side of this creek with shrubby growth between myself and the other side, but it's near a streamhead, so it's not far to walk around to the other side. So yea, very clear sound of footsteps in leaf litter. I just say, \"hello...???\" No response. I repeat a couple times with no response, but the footsteps stopped. Curious if it's just a military guy messing with me, I go around to check the other side...and nothing is there. Noped on out of there.",

I took out my phone and began texting my boyfriend. He asked me who I was texting and that was my cue to exagerate a little. I said it was my boyfriend of five years, I explained how we had just moved in together and how happy I was. I didn't lie, all of it was true, but I exagerated how giddy and happy I was.

She showed her husband and they remained calm and took turns throwing rocks at its direction while they got their stuff packed up and my uncle even hit it a few times because he said it would make a satisfying noise since it was big rocks he was throwing but it wouldn't go away and it would sometimes just slightly change positions so he finally rolled a Boulder down and they couldn't see the eyes anymore so they hiked down and started crossing the bridge to the other side where the minivan was but they again started shining the flashlights all around and finally super far off they could see the reflection of the animals eyes, crossing the river following them and it wasn't that calm of a current so that's when they started worrying he told his wife to not run because that usually hot animals who eat meat and hunt get triggered to attack he told his wife to go ahead finally when they were getting close while he slowly made his way towards the minivan but was throwing rocks at it to keep it focused and angry at him once she got close she just started running but it didn't care it wanted him, he was bigger game with more meat on him. It kept getting closer and closer until it was practically on the trail behind him in some thin bushes and he finally started running to the minivan and his wife opened the side door and had him hop in and she shut it. They then said they've seen them on YouTube but this once was a literally a monster size for a mountain lion he said it was the most gigantic thing he had seen in his life besides probably a elephant they pressed the panic button so all the alarms and lights would go off but it still just waited at the end of the trail for them to get out of the cat the whole time they were walking he said he hit it about 15 times with decent sized rocks, it was determined to find its meal though and didn't care.",

The moon was bright enough to barley see so it was fun just trying to stay in the path. We ended up walking for about an hour on the path, and there were trees all lining it all. About half way through I started noticing a darker spot off to the left of the path. I figured it was a tree stump but I kept my eye on it. As we ended up walking closer I could feel my heartbeat faster. A couple steps farther I could've sworn I heard some mumbling from up ahead. I just couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong and I reached down to my flashlight. I clicked it on and saw this middle aged man standing off this path, trees surrounding him. He was standing in the darkness all alone, no flashlight on, nothing. He had to have been there for awhile because I didn't notice him at all on the path. He had a radio held tight in his hand and was just looking blankly at us. The radio was playing some old rock music very quietly, I guessed this was the mumbling I heard. I froze for just a little while I took this all in. The whole group I was with did the same and didn't say a word. I realized we all were sitting in silence and decided to take the fist step, I waved my hand and said \"hey.\"\nThe man waved back and nodded. I just took this as confirmation that he saw me and my friends just kept walking forward. The man started walking down the opposite way. I couldn't help but look over my shoulder to watch if he would turn back around on us. I'm not sure what he was doing all alone in the dark out in that field, but it sure scared us as we were walking down the path.",

            "text": "TL;DR: A friend and I went on a walk in my peaceful town to another peaceful town. We thought animal sounds meant something was stalking us. It was a huge man who waited until we couldn't see him and then started chasing us in the woods down a path and we didn't stop until we got home.\n\nI have one I have told before and it's something that still haunts a friend and I to this day.\n\nFor some pretexutal context, this was the day of my high school graduation. It was a nice night and my family threw me and 13 friends a bonfire and grill out as a celebration. As the night went on all but one of my friends decided to retire. I will call him C. C is one of my 5 closest friends and we grew up together. Late night walks around town were not uncommon for either of us and in my home town they are commonly safe. About a 15 to 20 minute walk from my hometown is another little town called Little Italy (nothing like Italy). There had been a house catch fire earlier that week and we wanted to go on a walk that way. I live in West Virginia. So my town and Little Italy are tucked between two mountains in a valley. When you walk from town to town one side is all fTLorest while the other side is the Elk River. Meaning if you walk you have to be aware of animals and there is no where to run but backwards, into the river, or into the woods.\n\n\nOn our walk we used our phone flash lights to just talk about how good it felt to be done with school. We talked about how we would always be best friends no matter what. Just young childhood nostalgia type things about how life was going to change and what we would both do next. The path you walk to Little Italy opens up to a nice opening with some houses and one street light. The house that burned down is just before the street light. As we are walking past the house talking and laughing we get just under the street light when we hear what I can only describe as an animal growling behind the both of us. We both must have blown the first growl off at first because we paused talking but went right back until a second growl rose up and this time it was closer. This time I knew my friend heard it and our expressions freaked us both out. In my town mountain lions and cyotes are not unheard of. Rather than panicking we slowly left the street light to hide behind a thicket of trees and just listen. In hindsight this may have made us less aware of an animal. We both sat and listened for a good minute and watched the street light to see if an animal would come into view and that is when my heart stopped and my friend tried putting his hand over his mouth.\n\n\nIn the street light didn't step an animal but a fucking human being. A man who could have easily over powered either one of us. He was huge and he was snarling like an animal. My friend and I stooped lower behind the tree we hid behind and didn't say a word. We just watched this man snarl for what felt like minutes. He stood for about 2 minutes and then he stopped snarling and shouted, \"where the fuck did you two go?\" When he left the street light we listened. We got up and slowly started to stay out of sight walking back towards the pack to get home and out of nowhere we hear a flurry of running foot steps. It was the God damn man running full speed for the both of us. We took off and I remember thinking I was going to be killed. Luckily the guy was not fast my friend and I never stopped we ran all the way home both in tears from fear. When we got back my family was asleep and to this day neither of us have never talked about it. I found out later that a gas leak was active and that's why the house burned down. We think the guy chasing us was sniffing the gas or getting high. Either way that day lives with me forever.",

We figured since the park was so big we could probably just ride our bikes for a couple hours without worrying about the heat. I remember the sun had just gone down and the lights on the main trail began to turn on, we rode through a parking lot and I noticed someone just sitting in a truck with the lights off. I didn't think much of it at the time, but this was the only vehicle in the parking lot and they were parked in a strange lot since there wasn't much around aside from some trees. Anyways, we rode for maybe another 2 minutes before I noticed that the same truck was now following behind us but keeping their distance so that when we turned a corner they would then turn and follow us down the previous road. I alerted my friend and we both agreed that something bad was about to happen if we didn't get away from this truck. I decided that once we rounded the next corner we would grab our bikes and dart off into the thick woods so that we would have a chance at escaping (since they can't drive their truck into the woods). Next corner we enact the plan and get about 50 feet into the woods and crouch down, not even 30 seconds later we can see the truck pull up through the brush and it completely stops. My heart started to race because I think they spot us but as soon as that thought crosses my mind they bolt down the road and out of sight. I don't know how long we waited in those woods but it felt like forever before we rode back to my buddies car. Never did find out what was going on but we knew to never go back there at dark.\n\n\n2: I was with my cousin and we weren't walking but we were driving back to his place to hangout for a few days since we hadn't seen each other in awhile. The drive is about 40 minutes so I remember zoning out the window as we drove and listened to  music. When we were driving past Wright-Patterson airforce base I noticed something that looked like the blinking lights on towers except something was different, this green light wasn't blinking but stayed solid and seemed to be spinning. Seeing this broke me out of my zoned out state and once I focused I could see something hovering in the air and spinning. I remember asking my cousin \"Hey, hey, look at this, what is that?\", he slowed down and looked out the window and said \"what?\" and immediately after this thing flashed brightly and appeared a few miles to the left of where it was, it didn't sway or even seem to move, it literally looked like teleportation. My cousin and I were basically mind blown and yelling after we saw this little display and in the midst of our excitement it begins to \"teleport\" again by creating a zigzagging pattern away from us. I've never been so convinced aliens are real in my life.",

It was dark and I left my phone at home so no flashlight. No city lights at this point. I went for it, kept walking and I could hear ducks, I was coming up to the swamp.  It had a trail that ringed around it. There were benches where you could sit and stair at the bog, all the trees in the swamp were dead and it reeked of bird feces. I kept walking when I found someone sitting straight up on one of the benches in a white sheet, covering everything so you couldn’t see their face or body. legs weren’t on the ground, and they were dead still, just sitting there in the white sheet. Normally that wouldn’t be that intimidating but at 4 am in the pitch black and completely alone it felt like the start of a horror movie, at first I couldn’t tell what it was so I go closer until I realized it was someone under a sheet, I turned around immediately and went straight home to bed.

So I kept approaching, as these dudes were all throwing hands, taking turns knocking each other out on the concrete. As my headlights pulled up they all stopped to turn, barely acknowledging my presence as I feared they would turn their angst to me. But they didn't.

While creepy, it is in the middle of a college campus with apartments nearby. \n\nWell, this night, some fuckwhit on his bicycle is riding down the road (which is strange because there’s literally a bicycle trail 25 feet away) with his hood on. While it was nighttime, it’s still summer in the south and the humidity lingers in the air, so the hood was weird. \n\nHe was coming towards us, and then For whatever reason, dude decided to stop his bike randomly. Just like, right there on the side of the road. I reached for my roommate’s hand out of fear. We passed him and just kept walking. \n\n“Walk faster,” my roommate whispered to me. \n\nThey don’t have to say anything more, so my roommate, the dog, and I started power walking like we’re in the Olympics to get to the next street light. We rounded a corner to be on a road with houses, and plenty of light, on both sides. \n\n“What was it?” I finally asked.\n\n“After we passed him he started walking towards us,” replied my roommate. \n\nWe spent the rest of the walk holding hands and speed walking, even though we never saw the hooded man after we turned the corner. \n\nJust for added context, we’re both women so there’s no telling what the guy was doing.

This was when I was 17 and had my first vehicle, and my cousin had come into town to visit, so I took her out for a ride at the local lake one night. I grew up in a really small town of about 1,000 people, so barring wandering into a meth-park, most places were totally fine to putz around in. And the lake was nice, we sat at the bridge and watched the sun set, just shooting the shit and having a good time, but as it got later and later, I figured we should head back home. Cause while it was a fine enough town, two teenage girls hanging around in a dark park at night wasn't a smart move. But, also joking about Jason references and whatnot, I made comments about \"You never know what's sitting in the daaaark\" and pulled into what I would assume, on a week night, to be a very abandoned and unlit campground. But as we drove in, there were a string of 10-15 vehicles, men sitting in the driver's seat, alone. Every. Single. One. No headlights on, no one outside their trucks, just sitting there. I immediately freaked out. I went to turn around and one of the trucks, a white pickup, started up and turned behind us and started following us out. It was about a mile road to get out of the park, and the guy was trailing behind us, matching my speed, and flashed his lights. \n\nI just somehow knew I stumbled into something really fucked up, and decided to gas it. The guy sped up behind me, and with the 20mph speed limit and winding roads, I was easily pushing 60-70 and cutting it very close. But I knew the outlet was a highway, and had to get there to throw him off. He kept up mostly, but I had a good enough distance to cut into the mostly-empty highway and pull off the road and into a closed, dark gas station and cut my lights. The guy ended up turning down that road shortly after and was driving slowly, and didn't see me, so he turned around and headed back in the same direction as the lake.\n\nPertinent to the story, I was taking a criminal justice class at the time and was reasonably friendly with the teacher, the sheriff of my town. I told her about the incident and if there was anything I could or should do, because it felt like there was something going on out there. She said not to worry about it, that it was probably nothing, and there was no report made. A year later, the story was everywhere how there was a child sex trafficking ring busted at that lake.",

Well once I was by the building i heard a crash & a black lady came running my way & yelled at me to go away while running away.

With a small trail on the sidewalk which ended about 5 feet from the car. The front end was pretty messed up but i was confused since it had crashed into a fence not a concrete wall.\n\nSo i walked to the dog park scared as hell to walk back the same way since it's the fastest way home.. my dog decides to walk around a block next to the park & walk back the same way which took about 10 minutes to get back to the park & i was pretty surprised there wasn't any cop sirens or lights on the distance since it had been quite the impact but people around here don't really care to call cops so then again i probably shouldn't have been so surprised.\nSo i walked back & I SHIT EVERYBODY NOT.

So to get to my area from the train or the hotel, you have to walk around and as a result my neighborhood is thankfully obstructed from a lot of that vicinity's shadier foot traffic.\n\nOne night, a cop got shot at the shady Motel 6.  A drug bust gone wrong, from what I understand.  As a result, they shut down the hotel for the night - and kicked \\*everyone\\* that was staying there out.  I went outside for a smoke that night down on the corner having no idea what had occurred.\n\nWhat I observed over the next couple hours was akin to watching the \"Thriller\" music video in slow motion.  My quiet, little neighborhood that night was invaded by the funkiest collection of junkies, monkeys, pimps, hoes, trick-ass marks, mark-ass tricks, skip, scaps, and skallywags I've ever seen in my life.  It was like the real-life Dere-licte'd fashion show , complete w/ the evil DJ.  \\*Unreal\\* showing of human waste that I hope to never bear witness to again.\n\nI overheard a man (pimp) complaining about how a john had recently just asked to jack off while the pimp & his bitch teased him for not having a Dad.  I heard a woman openly debate the need for hospitalization due to her possibly-infected C-section scars.

            "text": "When I was a child I used to have this one particularly bad recurring nightmare. I went to therapy years later and it surfaced that the nightmare wasn't just a dream, that I had had this traumatic experience that I had buried deep for years because it was too scary to reconcile with as a kid. Thinking back on it I still can instantly summon gooseflesh and the cold stillness of knowing I was instantly about to die the moment I saw it.\n\nI was born in an old part of town, and our house was a national landmark. It had been the first house built and it was a big sprawling thing with a curved path through a garden and hydrangeas that covered half of the house. It was close to some undeveloped lots because a military base and cemetery owned the nearby area, so lots of things lived in the underbrush and it wasn't uncommon to have a late night surprise visit by some animal or other.\n\nI had stayed late at a friend's house down the road playing video games and my dad had called to ask me to come home. I was still pretty young but it was mostly known to be a safe neighborhood and everyone knew everyone, so I was trusted to walk home at night alone. It was maybe half a mile to my house. Shortly after I left the area of light from my friend's house, I heard what I thought was the 'chingling' sound a dog's collar and tag makes when it's walking, but I looked back and through the sparse light shining through slots in the wall around my friends house, I saw a giant dog of some sort sprinting at me full gait, and the noise was its claws on the pavement as it full bolted in my direction. It wasn't a breed I had ever seen and looked more wolf like than anything else, but I did see the reflection of light in it's eyes briefly and I knew it was completely focused on me. \n\nat first it was pretty far as it passed my friend's house when i first heard it, but the 'cha-chs chs kha' paw scraping asphalt noise and the ridiculous speed it was running at closed that distance quickly. the terror of thinking i was going to die made me feel like my feet were stuck in bags of sand, and I couldn't move fast enough or that I was stuck moving in slow motion while it just barreled at me. \n\nI managed to freak out and motor home with the sound ever getting louder, and i darted into the curved garden path just as i heard it reach the bricks of my driveway. i made it up the stairs of our front porch and the light at my front door, slamming it open and shut as quick as could be, and looking outside; but never saw it or knew exactly what it was.\n\nmy room was on the second floor of the house, and there was no way up to it from the outside or balcony outside my window. but i swear to you, when i woke up that night, i looked out that damned window, and its cursed fucking eyes were there staring at me from the window of the second floor just watching me. i couldn't move a muscle, and just stared back at those eyes, until i eventually passed out. \n\nmy dream was always hearing that sound while sitting in my room, and outside of my house i saw the eyes staring at me from the window. i would raise a blank paged book to my face so as not to see it. then when all was silent, i would lower the book back and there those giant eyes are, inches from mine, my entire field of vision full of those wide, empty, brightly black eyes. and then i feel and hear something sickeningly wet like a chomp/crush/splash/squirt. and my vision turns black.",

After our little detour, we ended up at the park as planned. We settled into our swings and began chatting. I never could get the creepy feeling out of my bones.

Back when I was younger and I would either get around on foot or on a bike I would always go back-and-forth from my friends house who lived across town and half the time this was in the deep hours of the night so I was just used to it. One night as I’m walking back home a car pulls up to me very fast and a man gets out aggressively and asking me “have you seen a phone have you passed a phone” and the entire time coming closer and closer to me this all happened so quick I had almost no time to even think about what was happening. So my sober side was just screaming “run” and as soon as I did the driver pulled off after me as the other man chased me down the road. If he had gotten another 2 feet closer to me he probably could’ve gotten me. I had to run into a complete strangers backyard and hid behind their shed for over 20 minutes before checking around. After leaving the property I saw somebody who I maybe thought was just no one but as soon as they acknowledged me they bolted towards me. They were pretty far so I was able to lose them running between different cross streets and eventually found my way home.\n\nBiggest problem of this entire situation was that it happened literally the only week my phone has ever been broken and I didn’t have one. So my message to all parents are to make sure you keep your child’s phone in working condition. There’s a slight chance I could’ve gotten robbed or kidnapped or trafficked or worse.

It was beautiful and generally safe, so I did it to destress often. \n\nOccasionally, I went with people, but this night I was by myself. The wind passed over this mountain with ease and it was difficult to hear anything but the wind. One night as I was walking up it I caught a strange noise out of nowhere. It was indescernible. \n\nAt this particular location, with it's heavy trees and mid-level elevation you couldn't see shit.  I couldn't find the noise as I looked around in the pitch dark. It changed pitch and sounded as if it was coming from multiple directions. I scanned all around me and picked up pace to pass through to a better vantage point. \n\nAs I finally scanned back to my trajected path, I find a faint silhouette of a man, and his arms - at least one - is flailing. Cautiously, I kept walking on the path grabbing my keys with a large carabiner turning it into \"brass knuckles\" around my hand. \n\nWe get within about 25 feet of each other and I eventually see, this mid twenty year old hippy guy strumming his guitar and singing at the top of his lungs. I barely looked him in the eye and scoot passed making sure he doesn't follow me and make me into a neo-deliverance film. \n\nThankfully, he went on his way and I didn't see him on the way back down an hour later. Creepy vibes though.",

Shortly before she got there she felt her heart come up into her throat and noticed a full grown mountain lion maybe a hundred metres away on the edge of the woods just watching her.

One night at around 11 p.m., I was finishing my run and decided to stop at a drinking fountain in the park, but for some reason they weren't working.  Fortunately for me though, the drinking fountains abutted a small cinder block building which houses the restrooms -- I could just get water from a sink.  So I walked in and it's pitch black, no light switches and I was without my phone.  Whatever, I knew where the sinks were so I started fumbling around trying to turn the water on, but then I heard something that made me freeze.  The sound of a person breathing noisily was emanating from one of the stalls.  I stood silent for a few seconds and then booked it the hell out of there lol.\n\nOn my way out of the park I took note that there were no vehicles anywhere nearby, which kinda freaked me out.

One night I was leaving the city to make the long trek down to southern Cali to see my long distance gf and since I didn’t have a car the cheapest route was to take connecting Greyhound busses. \nObviously anyone who’s taken greyhounds especially, long distance, know they aren’t always a gathering spot of the most upstanding members of society. My trip was special in that I actually didn’t see anything wrong on the bus itself so much as at the bus stop. It was midnight and a surprisingly crowded bus stop with people of various backgrounds and figures waiting at benches or in their friends cars before the bus came. One think that struck me was how quiet everyone and that part of town was even at midnight. In this quite atmosphere, hearing shouting and particularly drunk arguing in a car speeding around the bend from the closest main road was especially easy. I heard what sounded like a boyfriend screaming and threatening his girlfriend. Probably not much older than I was, probably mid 20s to early 30s. He pulled into the car park and forced her out of the car and nobody really thought to get involved. I certainly didn’t as I was alone, nor very big or intimidating and honestly pretty scared myself. He pulled her out of the car, they argued and he left her there. I can’t remember seeing her get on the bus or if she left the area not long after but from the drunk driving and screaming, and from what was said I got the feeling he abused her multiple times. \nI really do wish I had a taser or the balls to stand up to the guy but truthfully I wouldn’t know if I was hurting the situation or looking to get stabbed. An upper class men I knew got murdered in a relatively close part of the city a week before at a party and I was terrified and only recently 18 at the time. I was really just a bystander.",

I'll suck yo dick!\"\n\nAnd I kept shouting \"Not tonight! I got plans!\"\n\n\nNot long after, two prostitutes said \"Hey white chocolate, wanna pay my phone bill?\" Which is easily the funniest way I have ever heard of propositioning prostitution in my life. To which I replied, \"not tonight.\"\n\nAnd finally, a tall, heavy man was staggering down the street, holding a beer.

When I started the walk it was very dead streets were very empty with the exception of an occasional car\n\n5 minutes into the walk (which had me going down one very long street and left down another, so only one turn at the half way point) I realized a girl who was walking about 30 ft ahead of me was looking over her shoulder pretty often. Now we were both walking at the same pace a couple minutes after I noticed her shoulder checks it was clear to me this girl was feeling unsafe, I decided to walk faster so I'd pass her. (I figured once I pass her she'll see that I'm not following her and I'd get to my car faster win win). Once I did though she picked up her pace too, she didn't pick it up enough though so now we were going the same pace again.\n\nThis went on for about 15 minutes everytime I slowed down or sped up she did the same. I could see the underpass for the highway just after it is where I turn left I'm thinking to myself \"I really hope this girl doesn't turn left on the same street I already look sketchy enough as is\" but while I'm thinking that she turned down a street just before the underpass, when I did reach the intersection a few seconds later I looked for any cars before I crossed but when I looked right I saw the girl was now sprinting down the street. I continued down my path to my car, and now there's a girl in my city who has a story about the time she was followed for 20 minutes at 2am",

As we edged away from the bag and coat and towards some heavy nearby bushes I started to hear the sounds of twigs breaking. My pup is on full alert now and his ears are fully erect. I soon start to hear murmured voices, but can’t make out any words. By now I’m feeling really uneasy. I pulled my dog with me and circled around the back of the bushes where the sounds of crunching leaves and a low man’s voice grew louder and unmistakable.\n\nI was getting ready to call out when I saw the bloke.

A few years ago I was walking around midnight with my partner on the night before Halloween. The neighborhood I lived in was old so it was pretty dark, old street lamps, lots of big trees. Not great visibility but I was familiar with the area and felt safe. \n\n\nFrom down the street I saw what I assumed was a very tall, heavyset man walking briskly towards us swinging an umbrella. Nothing weird outright but I got \"the vibe,\" the female intuition. We approach a four way crosswalk when I put the pieces of what I'm seeing together: this wasn't just a large man. This was a large man dressed in an evil clown costume, waving not an umbrella but an axe back and forth. He had his entire face covered by this god forsaken mask, baggy raggedy clothes on, and what appeared to be either a very realistic or very real axe. Just swinging it. \n\n\nI figured it out before my partner did and I remember trying to scream whisper to them, \"stop stop stop.\" And of course they did the, \"WHAT? STOP? WHY?\" Very incognito. I froze out of fear at the corner, and luckily the clown man made a right and we didn't end up crossing paths. It still scares me so much, no clue if they were being weird for sake of a spooky night or they were actually frigged. Glad I didn't figure it out.",

            "text": "A couple of guys on motorcycles were coming down the road quite fast towards the intersection we were about to cross. My wife and I and our dog waited as we heard them approaching. They were biker types, one bike had a radio blaring loudly and the other bike had the rider and a female passenger on the back. They were yelling back and forth to each other and having a good time. This is a 2 lane road in a fairly quiet residential neighborhood with minimal street lights at most side street crossings. The road bends around to the right slightly in front of us and widens where it provides street parking for the house we are adjacent to. The curb lining the parking area curves back out and narrows the road back to 2 lanes. One of the 2 bikes decides he's going to ride parallel to the other and pass around on the right. At the last minute he realizes the curb is there and it's too late. He hits the curb at 30 plus miles an hour right in front of us and goes airborne. The bike begins to tumble and spark and flip through the air, the rider takes flight across the intersection in front of us clearing the road entirely and lands in the front yard across the street we are waiting to cross. I can't see where he has landed but I know this is really bad. I call the police and we go looking for him. He's traveled really far, maybe 100 feet or more and come to rest against a rock. The other bike stops and the lady on the back is screaming. The driver says we have to go and they leave. I can hear sirens in the distance and a man comes out of the house who's property he's landed in. Turns out he's a doctor. I can hear him talking to the 911 operator and relaying the man's condition. It's not good at all. There is debris scattered all over the roadway, I'm certain I see a pill bottle with some substance in it. We remain on scene and give our account to the police when they come. Another lady had been present at the same time across the intersection coming towards us and witnessed it as well. She is leraning disabled I think and was in shock as well. The man died of his injuries I found out later. Sometimes we see the lady walking when we do our nightly walks. I always say hello to her. She only replied to me one time and it was the date of that accident, she said April 12th and that was all. RIP 🙏",

I walk behind the truck and continue on my way as to not slow down his route.\n\nThen I hear his truck window roll down. This is where it gets hazy. I don't exactly remember what words were exchanged. This happened to be on 4/20 so he was trying to bait me to come with him and smoke weed together. I was immediately suspicious and tried talking my way out of it. Eventually I managed to get him to start driving away so I start walking home.\n\nRemember how I said my house was only a couple blocks away at that point? And the road was straight and open. He must have kept watching me as he drove off because I get home and lock the door (I just had a bad feeling). I'm home alone at this time too. I go into my room and start changing out of my work clothes when out my window I see the fucking truck pulling into my driveway. I was petrified. So I basically stood there in shock, watching him through my window.\n\nHe gets out of his truck and approaches my front door. Opens the screen door. Doesn't knock. And then I hear the interior door handle jiggle.\n\nNow I don't know what exactly possessed me to open the door. I armed myself with a comically large stiletto heel as it's the closest thing I had at hand I could use as a weapon.\n\nSo I open the door and this guy immediately starts apologizing, saying he realizes how creepy that all must have seemed, he lives just down the street blah blah and he works at this place blah blah, trying to make me feel less creeped out I guess. Only it didn't work because even after saying all of that, he goes back to pestering me to come hang out with him. I specifically can remember him asking WHY I wouldn't go with him. I said \"because I don't know you.\" And he said \"but if we hang out then you could get to know me.\"\n\nI don't remember how exactly this conversation ended but I made it clear I wasn't interested and that I thought he was a fucking creep. I closed the door on him and locked it. Immediately called my friend crying asking if she could come keep me company until my mom got home from work later that night.\n\nRecounting this all now, I actually think this experience might be a big contributor to the anxiety I struggle with today.\n\nEdit: I completely forgot the question OP asked was about creepy nighttime walk experiences 🤦‍♀️ this story happened around 6 or so and the sun was starting to set so I say it counts!",

            "text": "\nI don’t think this story has a good ending, so be warned before you read. \n\nWas a few years  back walking the streets of Seoul. It was around 2-3AM on a rainy Saturday, I lived near a bar/nightclub district and thus went out drinking all the time, so it wasn’t uncommon to see a friend or two out and about. I know I wasn’t drinking that night, but eventually got a little stir crazy and decided to go for a walk once the rain died off. \n\nI remember walking down the street and seeing this guy drunkenly plod up a hill. Standard fair. Finding someone in Seoul able to pass a sobriety test after 10pm is something of a challenge. So seeing the typical combo of S.Korean office worker+too much Soju caught my eye but didn’t really merit much attention; after all seeing someone drunkenly shuffle about from bar to bar is pretty common in a nightlife district. As I continued to walk down the street a few meters back from the shuffling man I feel a tap on the shoulder, naturally it’s a fellow degenerate/frequent nightlife goer greeting me. We chat a bit and catch up, discussing things not worth remembering before we’re interrupted by a noise I can never forget. \n\nThe best way I can describe it is a resonating crack mixed with the sound of a watermelon being slammed on concrete. It was a mean wet thud that seemed impossibly loud, somehow the sound cut through the background noise of clubs blaring their music and drunk partygoers in the midst of their merrymaking. My friend and I stopped talking,glancing around questioningly at what could have made the strange noise. As my eyes scanned the horizon I felt my insides squirm, the drunken office worker I’d noticed earlier was on the ground, and it didn’t take long to put two and two together. \nThe man had apparently tripped on a speed bump as he was going up the hill, and a few people realizing he hit the ground stopped to help him up before I noticed it. The sheen reflecting off the ground, dread set in as I realized this wasn’t rain reflecting off the asphalt but his blood instead. I yelled at everyone not to touch him, and pointed out the blood, women screamed when they noticed too.  I really don’t know if I made the right call here but my thinking was that he just suffered a massive head injury and moving him would make it worse. One of the nearby clubs had a bouncer posted outside, so I ran to him and frantically explained the situation. An ambulance was eventually called and one the bouncer stayed with him so no one would try to move him/direct traffic. The rest is a blur, I remember the sirens and the lights, I remember wanting to throw up when the lights illuminated the dark alley and you could see the blood pooling around his head, it looked like motor oil. \n\nI wish I had a better ending to the story, I know he eventually got medical attention but at that point did it matter? Should I have tried to wake the guy up and keep him from passing out instead? I don’t know if I saw someone die that night, in a pool of blood, alone with only strangers around them. Or if they did survive, is it possible there wasn’t any permanent injury? I’ll never get closure here. I may have witnessed someone’s last moments of life, and selfishly what haunts me is I couldn’t help but thinking over and over again ,”That could have be me”.",

He was in muddied clothes all alone by himself in the middle of no where. I passed by thinking i should stop to check on the kid, he might be in need of some help. I turned to look back while still driving, and i found him running behind me almost at my speed. That f***ing kid was running at a speed of around 80kmps towards me. I almost shat my pants. I sped my bike up trying to outrun him. I was driving at almost 120kmph (the road was not suitable for that speed). But i was more then happy to die in a crash then being caught by the kid. I was barely able to think. \n\nI pulled my phone and called my sister, somehow managing my phone and my bike at the same time. I told her where i was and i needed help as i was being chased by a ghost. I just kept driving. \n\nThe chase continued for almost 8-10kms. The road connected to the highway. And at that time the kid suddenly disappeared. After driving for another 10 km at maximum speed my bike or my skills allowed, i stopped, had some water and called my sister again. I could barely sleep for a few days as i could vividly remember the boy. \n\nI dont know what i saw as i being a complete atheist, do not believe in god or ghost. I still dont.

Eventually, we came across an overpass and heard this crazy screaming from below - blood curdling, unintelligible noises, coupled with a sour smell. Pigs. A tiny \"farm\" was built below a highway, and the sounds of these pigs could be heard for miles in the deadly silent night. A little further along our route, we came upon a massive roadside memorial. The shrine memorialized a horrible bus accident from years earlier, and had photos of all the victims. It had to be more than 10 ft tall, and was lit with hundreds of candles. \n\nAs my friend and I stopped to look at the memorial with the sound of pigs screaming in the distance, we saw a hooded man quickly making his way towards us. For whatever reason, we simply froze. He walked very close to us, within a few feet, despite having a wide open road, did not make any motion or noise acknowledging our existence, and passed us right by, disappearing into the night.",

Usually they'd ask for bus fare or occasionally a taxi fare to get home.  I'd always decline because I was walking to save money so I couldn't see why I should pay for them to ride, although I was pretty sure all they wanted was the money, not a ticket home.  \n\nOne night I was in the back streets between Commercial Street and Brick Lane, Jack the Ripper's old stomping ground.  It was slightly misty and with the old cobbled streets and weak street lights it felt like it could be Victorian London.  I was literally the only person on the street.\n\nI turned the corner and this guy came up to me.  He said he'd been in an accident and needed a cab fare to get to the hospital.  Yeah right, usual scam, there was no way he could get a cab on those deserted streets at that time of the night.  \n\nHe mentioned he'd grazed his arm and pulled up his sleeve to show me.  His arm wasn't grazed, he had the meat of his forearm exposed, like someone had methodically skinned him.  The weirdest thing was he didn't seem in any way bothered by it, he was completely calm and relaxed.  That was what made my skin crawl, the disconnect between this serious injury and his relaxed attitude.  I wondered if he was a druggy or something and had done it on purpose to get money.\n\nSince I walked everywhere I had a pretty good knowledge of London streets and knew the Royal London Hospital was just a 10 minute walk away.  I offered to walk the guy down there as it would be far quicker than trying to find a cab (and I still didn't really believe that he wanted to get to hospital anyway).  Sure enough as soon as he realised I actually intended to get him to hospital, rather than just give him money, he peeled off and disappeared into the mist.\n\nThat misty, Victorian atmosphere, the history of the place (Jack the Ripper), and the weirdness of the injury and the way the guy was acting left me seriously spooked for the rest of my walk home.  I definitely didn't want to run into him again.",

            "text": "I used to live in Santa Barbara CA. (Its a shitty, gentrification city, nobody that works there can afford to live there exceptthe mega rich) In my early 20s, I used to have BAD insomnia and also quite separately used to sleep walk. I used to drive Highway 192 a lot to unwind before crashing out. I'd drive back through Montecito CA and out to Ojai by way of Lake Casitas then take the 101 FWY back home.  I'd leave from my apartment and head up Alameda Padre Sera until the Montecito street round about,  then take 192. Sometimes I'd do this 2 or 3 times in one night to try and ware myself out.\n\nUsed to see all kinds of cool things on that drive.  Deer, foxes, families of raccoons,  loads of homeless people and such.  \n\nInsomnia first: \nSo I also used to walk a part of the city called Hope Ranch on foot.  I'd Make a 20-25 mile circuit from my apartment down to the water (about 3 miles) then head up Cabrillo blvd out to the city college, then walk up to the top of the hill and through some residential neighborhoods,  then down past Hendries Beach, and up the hill into Hope Ranch, then through Hope Ranch back out to State Street, on state until it became Hollister Ave, then along the train tracks until the 217 FWY, then walk along the 217 through UCSB campus, then up Los Carneros all the way to Cathedral Oaks, along that until it became Mission Canyon, then that to the museum of natural history, then through Rocky Nook Park, then home.  Sometimes I'd do this in,  from start to finish, 4.75 hours depending on how hard I wanted to push myself. My best time was 4 hours and 1 min,  but that was deliberate.  I didn't run it,  but I walk like I'm following marines around,  because that's how I grew up: following my parents (marines) around.\n\n  I'd listen to all the sounds of the night: distant traffic, homeless people sleeping or vomiting in the bushes (SB has a LOT of homeless people, mostly harmless,  often in need of psychiatric help. Since Reagan closed a bunch of psychiatric hospitals,  which shunted a lot of lifers onto the streets. Plus SB has a fairly high number of assistance programs for homeless) I was 5'10 and 175lbs with waist length wavy hair,  beard and a heavy coat. Nobody was coming anywhere near me.  I never carried a light, and always carried a pocket knife.  Not enough to be considered armed if I were ever stopped by police, but enough that I could do some damage if anyone DID decide to accost me. This was 2004, just a year out of high school,  so i didn't yet have a cellphone.  \nI'd listen to the dew dropping off trees onto the concrete, and my breath, and my footfalls. I prided myself at the time for being able to hear cars from very far off and be able to tell roughly what kind and how fast they were going.  Sedan, pickup, work truck, van, muscle car that kind of thing. \n\nOne morning,  I left my house at 1:15am to start my walk. Before too long, I am in the middle of Hope ranch, after all the main houses/estates, in a completely unlit part. There's no moon this night, and the trees overhang the road, making patches of even-darker on the asphalt. After a time, I became aware that there were no bugs making noise, no bats or owls. The wind was breezing through the trees, but the loudest thing is my breath. I stop and listen harder. Nothing,  but I have this super uneasy feeling.  \nI've seen coyotes and mountain lions on this walk before,  but they've never once bothered me. This isn't that feeling. \nI'm standing there in the middle of the road, having nothing but the blood in my ears.  I tell myself it's nothing,  but I step off the road anyway, and into the bushes at the side of the road, in a rain gutter. \n\nI hadn't been in the bushes but maybe 10 seconds when I hear the sound of a tire rolling over sticks coming from just up the road behind me probably 200ft away.  There's no engine noise, no rattling, no nothing.  Just how somebody sneaking in a movie snaps a twig by accident and people become aware of them,  it was like that.  I turn, and sure enough there's a black luxury sedan, like a Lexus or jaguar or Mercedes-Benz fully in the middle of the road straddling the double yellow, rolling uphill just as easily as if it were in neutral with somebody pushing. No lights, zero engine noise. It's big,  too. Square-ish front end.  I rock on my heels a bit further back into the gutter, aware that i really have nowhere to hide, but very very much wishing I did, and slowly take a knee.  The car rolls slowly by,  the only sound it makes is the contact point with the street. As it passes me, I hold my breath and watch,  trying to project as little energy as I can,  so as to avoid detection. It's all the way past me, and another 15 or 20 feet before I slowly let my breath out. I'm just starting to slowly draw another breath in,  when it stops.  Backs up.  The passenger side front window is next to me, probably half again further from me than my wingspan. The window rolls down,  I hear the electric window motor, by far the loudest sound. The window all the way open,  an elderly woman's voice asks me \"excuse me sir, can you tell me the way to the Mesa?\" \nI don't answer. There is a zero percentage chance I was seen, or heard. \n\"Sir?\"\nI still don't answer. I'm terrified. \n\"Sir, did you hear me?\" \nI am certain there is no way I was seen or heard.  Not without lights on the car. Not in the shadows where it am,  not on a night like tonight. Full moon? Sure, but tonight? I'm wearing all black or brown. \nI hear weight shifting inside the car. \n\"Excuse me.\" The woman says.  I can feel gaze on me.  I've definitely been seen. Inside the car is completely black. Not even the ambient light, what little there is, goes even a tiny bit beyond the window frame. \nFinally I say, in the  deepest  growl of a voice that I can manage. \n\"No.\" I say. A complete lie. But the question is a lie too,  as you'd have to come through the Mesa to get here.\n\"Fine\" says the old woman's voice, \"would you care for a ride?\"\nI don't answer. \nThe window rolls up after about 2 minutes of just sitting there, and the car rolls forward straddling the double yellow. \nIt takes a fork one way,  so in take the other direction at the fork, but not after I climbed into a tree and stayed still for at least an hour. I made my way as quickly as possible home right then,  sticking to the most well lit path I can find.  Once I get to State Street,  in turn for home at a dead run. \n\n\nSleep walking:\nThis isn't that scary in terms of what happened,  but it was plenty scary overall.\n\nI mentioned I used to sleep walk. \nI used to periodically wake up blocks away from home in just my boxers. So frequent was this that I started going to bed fully clothed, shoes and all, but I'd always wake up shoeless. When I got home,  I'd find my socks neatly folded on top of my shoes by the front door. I tried all kinds of things to keep me from going,  but nothing worked. I tried tying myself to the bedframe by one ankle, I tried setting up elaborate pathway traps to get out of my room,  I tried locking the door to my room. \nOne time,  in 2005, I woke up standing in the middle of the road, barefoot, feet bloody from walking on asphalt without protection, in Carpenteria CA, which is 23 miles from home at the time.  No idea how I'd gotten there or when in left, or what had happened between then and waking up.  \nI walked back home along the freeway, and got picked up by a state trooper who took me home no questions asked. I told her I sleep walk, and that I was walking home, and asked if she would please not pull up right in front of my house. I showed her my ID, answered some basic questions, and sat in the back.  \n\nWhen I got home,  I took a shower and scrubbed out my feet with steel wool to get the gravel out of the hamburgerthat was the bottomof my feet, then wrapped them,  and crawled into bed. I didn't sleep walk while my feet were healing, thankfully.  \n\nThe sleep walking stopped after I started therapy for some unrelated psychological issues.",

During the summer I worked during the day and played baseball and I'd get home late at night after games and I would go run. I had a 4 mile run I would do every night. So one night I'm cruising along and I hear this bell ringing behind me. It sounded like the bell on an old bicycle. It scared the shit out of me. I turned around and pulled my pocket knife out and stood there staring into the dark, down the road and I can't see anything. I don't hear it again so I take off running and as soon as I do. Ding ding ding. I turn again and stare and nothing. I'm terrified. Like what the hell is happening. I was luckily on the way back and I decide to just kick it and get my ass back to the house. The ringing followed me the whole way. Just out of sight but right behind me. I finally get to the house and run inside and grab a shotgun and a flashlight and go back out to hunt down this evil creature that's terrorizing me. I find him just down the road. It was someone's pet whitetail deer they put a collar on with a bell so no one would shoot it during hunting season. I guess it thought I would feed it.

We decided the best way to go about this was to go down to the river after dark and smoke a pack or so over a bottle of whiskey for a last hurrah. This was warm summer night and around 1AM we were just sitting and chatting about whatever was clever. The flow of the river was very slow and you could see a clear reflection of the moon and distant street lights in one direction, while the opposite direction faded to black as it was farther up the river and away from everything. \n\nWe had been sitting down in the same area the whole time (about 2 hours) on a large rock that was easily accessible from the bank, but was surrounded by water on most sides. A few feet forward and we could of dipped out feet in. Out of the blue we heard a large collision with the water in the direction where the light faded - up the river, just out of sight. Seconds later massive ripples were crashing against the banks where we were seated. The hair on our necks stood up as we both knew nothing human could make a splash/sound that loud and cause that much displacement. We quickly packed up and started towards home, vowing never to get back into that water again - a place that we so commonly swam in.\n\nWe never found out what made the noise but concluded that perhaps it was a massive catfish. However, it was very hard to get the river monster thought out of our heads though.",

I'll start by saying I've had a lot of unexplained events that seem ghostly, despite me being pretty unsuperstitious. \n\nI was 18 and I was on holiday at the coast where my nan lived. Id met a girl on holiday and we started a holiday romance. I also had regular friends who i would see each holiday and we'd hang out through the holidays. Anyway, I had had my mates over and the girl I was seeing. She had left earliest due to her nan being quite strict about times to be home. My mates stayed another hour or so. Shortly after they left, I decided to give my girl a call. Now, it was late and past my grandparents bedtime so I didn't want to wake them, so I went for a walk outside on the street. This was around midnight. \n\nMy nan lived on a culdesac. It was quite large, about 20m in circumference if I had to guess. At the top of it was a street lamp. I was standing under the lamp pacing around during my call. Pretty much exactly as my call ended, I saw lights coming up the street so I turned around to face them. This is where it gets freaky. I saw a man, wearing a black coat that went down to the ankles and had an upturned collar. He wore a black hat with a brim. Everything looked black. I could see a white beard but couldn't see the face. I should have been able to see the face bit it was just a void to my eyes. He was walking towards me, maybe 12m away. The light continued up the street and drove either through him or right past him. It was my mates who had left about 10 mins earlier on their moped motorbike. They stopped in a hurry and one jumped off the back. I looked back towards the dark man but he was gone. In the span of about ,2 seconds he had vanished. Now, from where he was it was atleast 15m to the nearest front garden. He would have had to cover that amount of ground and jumped a wall all in under 2 seconds. The weirdest part is my friends never saw him. I was freaked out and asked if they saw him. I asked why they had come back and they said they had come to warn me about a man they saw. They described the same man in a coat and hat, but they had seen him up and around the road, probably a mile away. He was on foot, they were on a moped. So somehow they saw the same figure I had, he beat them to me even though he was on foot and they had wheels. Then he simply vanishes in an instant. \n\nAt the time I thought he was a robber so I actually woke most of the neighbours to check their yards. I lived in South Africa, so a robber was a very real and common threat. Needless to say, no one saw anything. Neighbours came out with flashlights and guns and we checked the whole area. \n\nTo this day I cannot explain what happened that night, but that's my account of it. As honestly as I can tell it.",

The same cop would stop me and check my ID multiple times a week, but when I need him, I get ignored. I didn't have a phone at the time to call for help. \n\nThis guy looked like he had intent. The moment I saw his eyes, I could tell he was on something. Hooded. Pale. White guy, with a \"swag\" walk like he was from the hood, but walking around my rural country village. I said as he got closer again, \"I don't have any money or anything on me, I'm just out for a walk.\" He continued to follow me as I rounded the next corner. \n\nI'm normally a meek and mild person, and very soft spoken. It took all I had in me at that time to just start sprinting, and scream at the top of my lungs, in a small town, at nearly 2am. Porchlights came on behind me, front doors started opening. The man following me was nowhere to be seen.\n\nToo nervous to turn back around to ask anyone I disturbed for help, I cautiously made my way home while making sure I was no longer being followed. I didn't sleep that night, looking out my windows for any sign of the guy. Never saw him again. \n\nI walked late at night out of boredom and hopes of tiring myself out so I could sleep. It was one of my favorite things to do, being broke at the time. Enjoying the peace and cool weather in my quiet little town. This guy ruined it for me, and I stopped going on my late night walks.",

I was playing Pokemon on my phone and my girlfriend was reading a sign by a new feature they'd put in the park, so we were both stopped and not really paying attention to the dogs. Then my girlfriend asks me in a sort of panicked whisper what the dogs are looking at. I look up from my phone and my eyes take a second to adjust to the darkness but I see them both furiously sniffing this black mass on the ground by a trash can. I told her it was just a trash bag but as we pulled them away I saw human hair. It was a girl, curled up on the ground. She was wearing black and had a backpack on but nothing around to indicate she was homeless. I said I was sorry about the dogs but she didn't respond so we hurried off and took them back home. We drove by the park about a half hour later and the girl was still there, curled up on the ground. I got out of the car to check on her and half yelled, \"Excuse me. Are you ok?\" As I jogged up from the car. She didn't really respond but what I heard stopped my dead in my tracks about 30 feet away from her. It sounded like a baby crying. I was so freaked out. I could see her moving a little bit so I slowly walked up and tried asking her again. When I was about 10 feet away she rolled over and there was no baby, the sound was from her. She was writhing around and making the weirdest noises. This was at the beginning of quarantine so my mind went to some wild places, wondering if this virus was making zombies or something. I tried to talk to her a few more times but she just kept moaning and grunting and crawling around so I got back in the car and called the cops. She was probably having an overdose. We came back by the park on our way home and saw a lot of cops walking around the park with flashlights like they were looking for something. There was an ambulance there and like 5 cop cars so whatever was going on was pretty serious I guess. Again, I assume she was overdosing, but I don't really know what was going on.

We were partying until last call, and peaking really hard, so decided it would be really fun to walk home. \nAbout 3 blocks from my apartment, there was a mini van parked on the corner, and a pair of legs dangling out the driver-side window. I’m staring at these legs thinking to myself “now what on earth could this be?” when I see the rest of the person jump backward out of the window, holding a huge backpack. I then realized that all the cars on the block had their windows busted out and this person was jacking everyone’s shit.\nI don’t know what came over me, but I just yelled “hey fucker!” and started sprinting after them. They were running super fast, but in my hyper-alert LSD state, I was hauling ass. As I’m gaining on them, they start pulling into the bag and throwing whatever items they grab at me in an attempt to slow me down, meanwhile I am straight up Matrix-ing everything from CD cases to laptops.\nI get up behind this person and as I’m reaching to grab them, the hood of their sweatshirt falls back and reveals a long pony tail, so I grab it, and in the same motion am able to swing the person into a wall. At this exact moment I see that this thief is a teenage girl. I’m totally in shock because I was a millisecond from beating this persons ass. As I’m holding her up against the wall, a car comes screeching down the street (corner of Church and Caesar Chavez if you know SF) and hops over the curb, almost crashing into us. Two of the biggest dudes I’ve ever seen in my life jump out, one with a gun, both yelling “take your goddamn hands off my sister”. \nAt this point I’m tripping really hard and basically just let go and they drove off.

For those who do not know Miami Gardens is not the safest city.\n\nAs I’m walking near the street I’m supposed to meet them on a see a couple of Pitbulls fighting to the death, like really just going at it.

I walk backwards faster and they began walking toward me slowly, the growling getting more intense.

I shine my light on her heels so I can pour the vodka we had on it to clean it and to our horror it looked like some sort of animal organs, and human shit. \n\nIt’s not uncommon in certain neighborhoods in Miami to occasionally find beheaded birds, but that was something else.",

There I was in the backyard trying to pinpoint the location of the bird call kinda like a bat using sonar and suddenly I felt some sort of “wave” or what felt like energy come directly over me accompanied with what I can only describe as a buzzing sound. This instantly gave me chills and raised the hairs on my neck as I couldn’t see anything but I had the very real feeling of something approaching me and passing over me through the calm air. It definitely was not the sound of bird wings flapping but as soon as that happened, the bird calls completely stopped and I was back inside in a heart beat.\n\nAbout 30 minutes prior to this, I had pulled into the drive way and wanted to do some stargazing, being that it was a clear night in the country.

A couple years ago, I would regularly walk the trail at night, and because I’ve heard of both people and animals going after hikers, I always made sure to carry my phone, flashlight, and concealed pistol. One night I was walking the loop at about 9:30, and just as I passed the 1 1/2 mile marker, I heard what sounded like pained grunting coming from up ahead. As a Criminal justice student who was studying to be a cop at the time, I immediately (and stupidly) started running toward it, thinking someone was injured or in trouble. I kept my light on the path as I was running, but at a certain point, even though I didn’t see anything, I got a bad feeling. I stopped dead in my tracks, shined my light around, and saw two fully grown black bears about 20 feet away from me, just off the path. They were facing away from me, apparently eating bugs off of rocks they’d kicked over (which, fun fact, comprises the majority of their diet in my area). As soon as they noticed the light, they turned around, saw me, panicked, and ran back out into the forest. I count myself extremely lucky. Black bears aren’t super territorial (nothing like grizzlies, at least), but they’ve been known to attack when they feel threatened or scared, and I doubt my little 9mm subcompact would’ve done much to stop two 200lb bears. I called the local Sheriff’s office to let them know that there were bears in a public park, and just finished my walk *very carefully.* The adrenaline didn’t wear off until I got back to my truck.

I had gone about half a mile when I got near freeway overpass, and I noticed a car coming towards me. There was nothing assuming about the car, it was a light colored older Honda. But it slowed down as it approached me, and a man rolled down his window as he came to a stop not far from me. Yes maybe what I was stupid out there so late, and I explained my situation. It seems that he took pity on me, and he offered me a ride. Being rather inebriated, kind of a stubborn dick, and kind of personally against hand outs, too him \"no\", and kept walking. He then pulled off, turned around so he was going the same direction, and rolled his other window down and offered again.\n  Now my suspicion was peaked. He was being unnecessarily nice and that usually has strings attached, and he was also somewhat move forceful in his speach. So I told him no more forcefully this time and I crossed the road to give me some distance and kept walking home as he took off in a huff. \n  It was a very odd encounter, but I never really thought a lot about it until probably about a year later. My live in girlfriend and I we're having problems, to put it lightly. We had been yelling at each other all evening, and our argument lasted well into the night. Our argument spilled out into the sidewalk and a bit down the street, and after we had finished exploding on each other she left me sitting on a bench and started walking back to our apartment. And as she was walking back to our apartment, a light colored Honda rolled up next to her. It took me a minute to realize what was happening, but I walked after her. And as I got closer to the car it took off in a hurry. And I talked to my girl friend, and she basically told me the same kind of scenario that I had gone through almost a year before. This guy was being unnecessarily nice, and offering to give my girlfriend a ride somewhere, got scared off when he saw me walking up.\n  Sure he was innocuous, sure he wasn't being violent, but to see him twice doing the exact same thing so insistently makes me wonder if he might have had more sinister motives than what he let on. \n  Maybe I'm just suspicious, maybe I'm just paranoid, but part of me believes that we encountered a possible monster that night.",

I take out my knife that I just started carrying because there were juvenile cougar sightings around where I was walking (yes I know a knife would be useless but it's better than nothing and I keep it razor sharp) and slowly head back down the hill. Once I'm a safe distance I jog back to the family and warm them before taking the extremely long way home. \n\nWas I in danger, probably not. Did my gut give me the \"oh shit\" feeling? Yes.

Like 10s of thousands of acres. As a kid it was a haven for exploring and getting into things I shouldn't. Naturally, night time hikes were a thing for several years. Over the course of around 3 to 4 years my step brother and I ran into quite a few scary encounters. I'll share one paranormal, and one normal.\n\nLet's start with the (not so) boring normal one. On huge ranches like where I was, pigs were a common sight. Normal wild pigs are enough of a concern, but there is a mix breed out where we lived known as \"Russian Razorbacks\". We can't really call them that because at this point they are interred with all sorts of other pig stock. What this means is that they tend to vary in size and aggression. For a reference point, we once had a 300lb boar in our sheep pen. It's hooves were large enough that I mistook the prints for a small cow/large calf at first. \n\nTo also give context, that boar was in our sheep pen because he liked to kill the lambs and drink the milk from their stomachs. Pigs are demons.\n\nSo my step brother and I are out late one night just cruising from field to field, watching and listening for interesting things. We round a curve in the road and see a group of 15ish or so large, dark blobs in the field. We thought it was cows, and we liked chasing cows. So we go running up with our dog leading the way, all of us convinced we are gunna chase cows. \n\nAt the last second my dog yelps and turns tail, and the dark blob nearest me let's out a startled hell-squeal. There was a brief moment where it felt like they stared at us and we stared at them. The unnerving part was they stood about shoulder height and I'm 5ft9in. Then all hell broke loose as we ran one way and they ran the other. I'm glad they didn't try to run past us, or through us. \n\nAs for the paranormal, my step brother and I used to raid the neighbours gardens. Neighbour isn't really an apt descriptor though as the house was only occupied when the cowboys were around... Which is maybe 2 to 3 months in the year. The garden is mostly abandoned but watered by a natural spring, so the trees always have oranges. \n\nNaturally, being teens, we treated these like the refrigerator of the land and would just stand in front of them for eons, munch away at one orange after another. We got used to scouting the place first to watch for the cowboys, didn't wanna get in trouble ya know? \n\nWell one night we decide we're gunna LOAD up on oranges. We made makeshift baskets/bags out of our hoodies and just crammed a dozen or so into them, each. Then suddenly a lantern turns on at the top the drive way, we are in plain sight of it but thankfully it's dark! We basically curse under our breaths and shuffle like I imagine a panicked penguin would when chased by a seal. \n\nWe waddle hard for the nearest ridge line with grass so we can blend in, all the while the lantern is slowly bobbing, and following. The worst part of this is, we know we are busted. We are the only kids and the only idiots awake at 2am in the middle of nowhere. So it's more like we're hoping to buy time? Idk. We were young and dumb.\n\nAnyways, we get to the ridge and slide down into the tall grass and watch the lantern slooooowly following the path we took. We quietly compare notes to make sure we both agree that it looks like the person we woke up is indeed slowly heading towards us. \n\nWell, fuck. Seems he/she is. So we cuss again and waddle for an even further ridge. We panic waddle a good ten minutes away and settle into the grass again, only to see the lantern wandering back and forth where we had been laying before. It creeper us out a bit, bit we figured at this point the person had given up. My step bro decides that he wants to see who followed us, no clue why. I also can't explain why I agreed and thought it was a good idea. But don't you worry, we stored our oranges on the side of the road so we wouldn't have to waddle like the idiots we were.\n\nSo we proceeded to slowly work outrway back to the person/lantern. We creep our way closer and closer, slightly spreading out as you do when hunting. Finally we get within a good stone's throw of the lantern and can see it clearly.\n\nIt was just a hovering light. No person. No frame that we could make out. It bobbed like a lantern being held up though, all the same. I remember staring into the night so hard I gave myself a migraine because I thought I just wasn't seeing the attached person. \n\nStep brother and I looped back to confirm with each other that we saw the same thing, agreed it was weird, and that we should leave. As we turned to go, the light started bobbing its way towards us again. We booked it back home and slept with the lights on.\n\nOranges were delicious though!",

It's mostly well lit but still dark because of the trees blocking the street lamps. Looking ahead I noticed a van coming down the street fast and suddenly park near one of the lamp post.

After what was probably just 5 minutes they jumped back into the van and drove of gunning down the street passing me. At this point I don't know if I witnessed a murder or what. Don't know why I didn't turn around and nope the fuck out of there but I couldn't get it out my head that someone might have died in front of me. I , slowly, walked up the light pole. It took time to even reach it since I kept stopping and rethinking if I even should go near it.\n\nI finally reach the light pole to notice something. abnormal about the \"body.\" It was just a fucking holloween prop in a body bag that they stabbed with a knife. the blood on \"body\" looked like food coloring.

They then dispose of the animals (or at least the parts they don't eat) at places of power, and since this church was at a crossroads and near another church, i guess it was as good a place as any. Many times they do this drunk, btw, because drinking alcohol is part of the ritual. I used to get dead chickens and cats dumped at my house all the time, but that's the first time I actually saw them do it, and with a full sized goat no less. I'm not ordinarily one to judge people, but that's some bullshit right there.",

There were usually about 14 or so of us. However, on this particular night it was a bday alumber party so about 20 of us.. The thing we'd do is play in 2 teams of hide and seek. Seekers would give the hiders 10 min to hide.  Seekers would have 3 flashlights or so, so we usually would split into a couple of seeker groups.\n  \nThe best part about being at this one friend's house is that it was in the woods about 50 yards from the main road. There was a small Christmas tree farm close and that was part of the play area.  \n  \nOk so, it was probably around 1am or so and we were about an hour into this game. Me and a few people on the seekers broke off and searched the Xmas tree farm. We had been outside for so long our eyes had adjusted to the dark night. Our flashlight wasn't what they were now, no LEDs...just the usual handheld light. We went into the aisle between a couple rows if trees, pretty much in the middle and saw one of our friends about 15 ft or so in front of us. We'll call this friend, Eric. So Eric was a shorter person than us, shortest of the group. We loud whispered his name, \"Eric....Eric do you see anyone?\"  \n  \nNo reply, and he wasn't moving.  \n  \nAgain we say to him, \"Eric, let's go this way and check this other spot.\"  \n  \nThen he bolts left, real fast. Before we started running with him, thinking he saw someone, we hear, \"What? Guys I'm right here.\" Eric had been just a few feet behind us.  \n  \nThe creepy part is we had no idea who or what this thing was in front of us. It looked to be on 2 feet, but completely black.

A girl was approaching in a really out of it state asking another person, who walked off scared for help. I sorta leaned against the car door because I had a knife inside if she was drugged up while I tried to ask her what she needed. After I got the vibe she wasn’t going to try anything weird and calmed down a bit I managed to see if she needed to come inside with me because she was barely dressed and it was freezing out. While walking in the store I realized she was basically holding all her clothes in her hands and she had walked up from the basement of an empty car garage at 2am. 95% sure she had been raped moments before I went out there for a break. My wife at the time was a survivor and it was enough for me to have a basic understanding that I thought she’d need somewhere warm and safe to sit while she waited for a friend to come get her, a phone to use, and an offer to call the police if she wanted. Luckily we worked in a bakery so a I hope a warm cookie helped. It was the smallest kindness I could offer at the time. I had my only employee that night go ahead and quietly contact the police in the back and give them a rough idea of what was going on, but her friend showed up before they did and I never even got a name. I let them know the garage had cameras all over it and they should at least contact the apartment to see if the records showed anything or not, but looking back idk if she even wanted that. They never did anything without a report anyways. I never saw that girl around or read about anything happening. Some nights I think about her and try to imagine if there was anything more I could have said or done. It was more terrifying than any of the drugged up schitzos wandering around that area ever were because I felt so incredibly powerless to do anything.",

            "text": "When I was like 19 a friend who eventually died of a fentanyl overdose years later got us a nug of weed but I had to go get us papers or a blunt to smoke it with. I was driving. I'd never smoked weed before, but decided tonight would be the night I'd smoke for the first time. We lived like two blocks apart in an isolated part of town, so once we were smoking we'd already be home on our blocks. He smoked regularly, but was always broke, so he'd only ever have a small gram or something, so this was as small an amount of weed as you could have and still roll a (very thin) blunt. We drove down to a rundown part of the main drag in our large, urban city to hit up the 7-11. It's like midnight. I park a block up from 7-11 because we're both nervous about buying the blunt and worried cops would be at the 7-11 and notice us and we'd get in trouble. He asked if he could stay in the car with the key in the ignition to listen to music. I obliged this. I'm gone like 5 minutes between walking the block to the 7-11, waiting in line, asking for the blunt, paying and walking back to the car. I come back with the blunt and  I'm like 15 feet from the car, less than 10 seconds away from being back inside the car, when my friend suddenly jumps out of the car and locks it using the door mechanism, windows up, but with the key still in the ignition.  He couldn't explain why he did this, he just did. But, this locks us out. We're in a rough part of town parked right outside the \"One Hour Rentals\" motel. There's weed all over the top of the center console that he's broken up to sprinkle into the blunt. If a cop comes, we're fucked. If anybody else in this neighborhood notices us, we're fucked. If either of us has to call our parents for help, we're fucked. So no matter what, we are now fucked. \n\nWell, a kinda nice, kinda sketchy guy walks out of the motel and asks us what's up. I try to act like there's nothing going on, but my friend tells the guy the entire situation in total honesty. This dude doesn't hesitate. Without consulting me, this dude walks over to my car, puts his fist into his shirt and punches out the back corner window, reaches in, pops the lock to the back passenger door. We get back in the car. But so does this dude. He wants to smoke with us. We jump into the car from the back, climbing over the center console so I can get back in the driver's seat and my friend can get back in the front passenger seat. \n\nIn the process, we knock this meager bit of weed all over the floor of the car, so we couldn't roll a blunt of weed even if we wanted to at that point. \n\nOne Hour Motel Guy has hopped in with us and wants to smoke. We explain the situation with the weed on the floor. So now he wants money. Like he wants us to give him any cash we have on us, or go to an ATM with him and give him cash from the ATM. He's quite upset and emphatic about this. (\"Come on, man. I helped y'all out. I broke into your car so I could get in trouble for this shit and I ain't going back to jail, man. Just give me something. I ain't leaving empty handed cause I did this for you\" etc.) \n\nWell, my friend pulls a switchblade and pops it open in the front passenger seat. This guy is ranting and raving and looking out for cops, so he doesn't notice and he isn't really paying attention to us. My friend goes \"I gotta fucking stab him, man. I gotta. We gotta get out of here. I'm gonna stab him and push him out and then you drive.\"\n\nI just about never ably think on my feet, fucking ever. I usually kinda freeze. I'm not clever at will. But in this moment, I go \"wait, give me a second.\" to my friend. Then to the guy in the back I say \"Hey man, we have curfew, I gotta drop him off or our folks are gonna call the cops on us, you know? My parents will be so happy you helped us they'll give you a lot more money than I could ever take out of an ATM right now. Give me your room number and I'll come back with the cash as soon as I drop him off and check in with my parents.\"\n\nThe guy in the back calms down, gives me his room number, gets out of the car with a smile on his face, shuts the door and steps back, walks back into the motel waving at us.\n\nI drive off. Dropped my friend off. Went home. Dealt with the broken window, my pissed off parents, vacuuming the weed out, etc. in the morning. But yeah, that was fucking scary for me.",

I was minding my own business when a random white early 90's civic pulled up right next to me. It's windows were tinted very dark and I couldn't see inside. I turned toward the car, stuck my hands into my cargo shorts, and smiled the creepiest smile I could muster toward the car. The car and I had a stand off for a few moments which seemed to be minutes, then they took off down the road. I really felt like at any moment I was going to be mugged. I ran home.\n\nAnother time I was walking through a neighborhood golf course drawing dicks on the sand traps (please be kind I was young and dumb. This was over a decade ago.) . I left the golf course and was following a canal that ran through the course and neighborhood. All the sudden I see four bobbing lights coming toward me. I thought they might be the police.. maybe someone called and they were on scene to investigate my sand dicks. I crossed a nearby bridge to get to the other side of the canal, and soon was passing them. They yelled at me from the other side of the canal, \"Hey, what are you doing out here?\". It was a group of teenagers just like me.. \"Hey, stop dude! We just want to talk to you!\". I picked up my pace. \"Hey we want to sell you some weed!\".. they crossed the bridge and were now behind me.. that's when I heard a faint \"Let's fuck him up.\"..  I started running and looking for an outlet.. they were right behind me. I jumped a nearby fence and fell into a backyard. I ran through that backyard and jumped over their front fence. I got up and sprinted full speed down the street. I got to a nearby intersection and looked back just to see one of them falling over the front yard fence. I kept running and never saw them again. I lost them.\n\nI was a dumb teenager that couldn't sleep at night, so I went for walks late at night. Those were the two most intense instances that I encountered. Luckly I haven't had any experiences like those since.. but I have had maaaany minor run-ins similar to these.",

We were walking along a dark street next to the park, however this part of the park was all trees and bushes. We heard a rustling in the bushes 30-40 m behind us and a sketchy looking dude comes out of the bushes and starts following us quickly. At this point he is just a dark shadow. We were just kids and this guy looked like a grown man and not one of the other teenagers we were meeting. We were super scared as he was approaching us fast but we didn't want to run. I have no idea what I was thinking at this point but when we were under a street lamp I pulled out my knife and flashed its blade under the light. Luckily the guy turned and walked away. I have no idea what I would've done if he didn't. We booked it to the place we'd arranged to meet our other friends. \n\nFunnily, at this same \"park jam\", a gang of other high school kids we didn't know had gotten word of it and showed up to rob people. I knew one of the guys from a community centre summer camp we both went to as children so my friends and I kept our phones and pocket change that night.\n\nI'm glad I'm not a teenager thats desperate for that kind of stuff anymore.",

I subsequently had to wait around for the next one, so by the time I finally got off at my stop it was late and dark. \n\nI was about 16 years old, and my family home was roughly just over a kilometre walk away from the station. Unfortunately that walk home was down a (by now, very dark) path that ran alongside the train tracks, with dense trees running along the other side. There was absolutely no lighting bar the moon, which was fortunately somewhat visible that night. \n\nThere was no one else about and I was the only person that had gotten off at my stop, so I got to walking. Literally as soon as I was away from the station lights and in to the darkness of the path, I got that dreaded, horrible feeling in my gut (I'm sure you know the one). I stupidly disregarded it, and tried to put it down to my imagination running wild because it was dark and I was alone. To be honest, at that point I was tired and just wanted to get home, so I picked up the pace a little and kept moving. \n\nI then heard footsteps behind me, something I didn't disregard, and I began to move even faster, kind of like a half walk/half run. Something inside of me suddenly told me to just run as fast as I could, so I did, and thank god I was a good runner back then because whoever it was behind me started running too. I could hear their footsteps loudly and them breathing heavily, attempting to keep up with me, but thankfully they never caught up.\n\nOnce I got to the section of the path where the trees had cleared, and opposite my (very steep) driveway, I darted across the road without looking back and ran as hard as I could up to my front door. I never did see who it was behind me, but the experience was utterly terrifying. And I know this next part reads like something out of a bad horror movie, but this was unfortunately, and unbeknownst to me at the time, the very first incident in what would become almost a year of being stalked (but that's a story for another time). \n\nMy apologies for any formatting errors, this is my second comment ever.",

Suddenly there’s this deep, throaty grunt-scream noise from far away. I can’t really place it and my instincts can’t quite either; is it a human in distress? An animal? Is it dangerous? My fight and flight response is definitely active, but I don’t know what to do. I stop and listen.\n\nIt comes again a few times. I think it’s moving closer somewhere off to my left. Nothing to see on my street and there are buildings in between the noise and me.\n\nI decide to at least move so I start walking. It comes again and again, getting slightly louder with each of my four steps. There’s a steady rhythm to it. At this point, I’m pretty sure it’s human, but I’ve never heard anything like it and the rhythm seems too slow for humans. I pick up my pace but can’t walk directly towards it as I’m blocked by apartment buildings.\n\nI come to a crossroads and it’s right there, a few hundred meters from me on the opposite side of the street, moving and grunting and screaming in the dark. I can’t see the source yet, but as it slowly approaches I can make out a sharp intake of breath between the screams. I’m paralyzed as it jerkingly makes it’s way towards me.\n\n15 or so meters from me, he finally steps into the light. A young man with special needs. But he’s angry, his entire face twisted in rage and what must have been agony. One leg drags after the other when he walks. Every step seems to be made with such effort that he has to scream it out and grit his teeth against it. This might have been his normal, but he gave off an air of defiance so strong I highly doubt it. I watch him slowly pass the crosswalk and continue down the street. He was briefly aware of me. I’ll forever remember his insane display of defiance against the night, his circumstance, the universe, everything, and I can’t imagine the strength both mental and physical that it must have taken.\n\nI’ve never experienced anything like it before or since and it’s been a source of motivation to me whenever I feel that life is hard.

A man in a dark hoodie with the hood pulled up was walking passed on the other side of the street, and when he reached the point where he was directly across the street from us, he turned directly at us and began walking much quicker.  We were all of course watching him so as soon as he did this we all freaked the fuck out, screamed and turned running to our house without looking back.  Once inside we couldn’t see anything from the windows.  It was probably someone older just playing a practical joke on some younger kids, but it scared the hell out of us.

I was on the perpendicular road to the intersection, about 3 houses away, and I just kept staring as I walked by because it looked so unnatural. It’s possible she was waiting for somebody or like a food delivery, but it was around 2am and the neighborhood was perfectly dark and silent otherwise. The reason I kept staring is because she didn’t move at all the entire time. I honestly thought it was a doll in a chair that somebody put out for trash pickup, but then I realized it was way too big. Looking back, I guess it was eerie because she wasn’t looking at a phone or anything. Just staring forward. Nobody really just hangs outside in the dark in my neighborhood either- it’s pretty woodsy and you usually only see cats, deer and raccoons that late.",

That night,  her dog was very jumpy and we cut it super short- not only was the dog being difficult but neither of us felt comfortable for some reason. Got home, went to put the dog out back- and a cougar crept from the corner of the fence across the yard, following exactly the path we took.

I just like stare at him for a second, and his eyes were rolled back, and I realized he wasn’t slumped against anything, he was just standing like a zombie.

Pretty sure it was heroin that guy was stoked on. \n\nSecond story. \n\nI couldn’t sleep on a Saturday night, after I had already come back from bars or whatever I was doing that night. This was close to 3 am. I figured the bars were closed, as they do at 2am, and the people who stick around would be clearing out. I see three guys smoking, and I offer a dollar for a cigarette, which they take. I talk to them a bit and find the three of them are back on leave from the army. Nice guys. I finish my cigarette and I guess they liked my company because they gave me another. As I’m lighting up, another guy comes over and asks for a cig for a dollar. They say they’re running low, so no, sorry. Guy offers two dollars, and the black dude in the crowd decides if he’s offering two dollars, this guy really wants one, so he gives him one. The guy takes the cig, lights up, looks the guy in the eye and says “thanks, n*gger.” Well… it took a few seconds but the four of them got into a scrap and the racist was outmatched, obviously, and got pretty brutalized.

            "text": "My younger brother and I were walking around our neighborhood late one night when we were teenagers, which we would do often and for long periods of time, talking about how spooky our neighborhood was (we lived in one of two houses nestled in a trailer park in central Alabama- very dark, no street lights, dirt roads and lots of trees) and talking about spooky, but allegedly true things we'd heard or read about. Specifically, I had been telling him about [The Devil's Footprints](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Footprints), a thing that particularly freaked me out. About an hour or so later, we came around a corner to walk down the middle road in the trailer park behind our house. It was the spookiest road of them all, crowded by dark trees and a few uninhabited trailers. The trees on both sides stretched out and blocked most of the moon light, but the sky was bright and clear, so there was a comparatively bright path down the middle of the road. As we start down the road, he looks down at the dirt and notices what appears to be big, rounded horse-like steps right along our middle path, mixed in with our shoe prints in the dirt. We immediately start to freak out. We did it. We summoned the devil by talking about him and now he's following us around the neighborhood. We follow the prints slowly, which really do follow our own path. They round the corner at the end of the block, just as we had been doing, continue for another 10 or so feet, and then they just stopped. No more tracks. We turned around and followed them back in the opposite direction, back to the only streetlight, at the beginning of this road. We kneel down and check them out. Maybe someone on a horse? But horse tracks wouldn't just stop like that. Plus, we probably would have heard a horse. We decide FUCK THIS. Be it horse or devil, we should probably go home. It's almost midnight and something scary is following us. As we head back down this middle road to a little alley that connects up to our driveway, my brother starts doing this silly, twisty, tippy toe walk he had been doing earlier in the night. I glance down, and see the prints he's leaving in the dirt- an exact match for our mystery prints. We had both forgotten he had been doing that earlier. It was just bad timing for him to be leaving weird footprints. It was quite a relief for both of us, but we still decided to go home.",

It felt like a small army was after me.  Scared the shit out of me.\n\nI had to go home an extremely long way with a long trek through the woods to avoid them.  I tried to cut along the edge of our high school practice football field, which was a 100 yard stretch of chain link with a thorn bush growing against it.  Got about a third of the way in and was so stuck in the thorns I couldn't move. It took me almost two hours of carefully pulling vines off of myself to backtrack, but I'd lost my pursuers while hiding in the vines.  This was before cellphones and at one point I was worried I might be stuck there until someone rescued me.  But I finally broke free, scratched to hell and covered in thorns. Literally sprinted the entire rest of the way home and silently snuck in while the sun was coming up.  I could hear my parents waking up about 10 minutes later.

It’s in a tiny alcove, like if you’re too large you won’t be able to walk down it because it’s so narrow. I usually leave that window open during the summertime to let cool air in. One night I was sitting on the couch when I start hearing this absolutely gut wrenching sob. It’s loud, and I’m having a really hard time placing where exactly the sound is coming from. For a moment, I thought it was my neighbors but nah. \n\nI go outside to see if someone needs help. It’s LOUD like couldn’t be more than 20 feet from my house. Im on the street, trying to follow the noise of this person who is so clearly in an immense amount of pain. As I’m getting closer to the sound, it keeps getting louder. Im peering in cars, I’m checking driveways, I’m worried that someone is in need of serious help. \n\nThis grief stricken wailing has now been going on for ten minutes straight. My adrenaline is high and I have 911 at the ready. I can’t hear anything but this absolutely painful sobbing and it can’t be far away. I crossed over from one property line, onto another when the sobbing stops and everything goes dead silent. \n\nNo more crying, no breathing, no sniffling. Nothing. My foot is hanging in the air, mid step as I assess the situation. I stay in this position for another few seconds, waiting to see if I can hear ANYONE besides the crickets that I can now hear are humming at their usual pace. \n\nHave you ever ugly cried so hard that the whole neighborhood can hear you? Just STOPPING that is near impossible. Sure, you can stop your wailing. But you can’t stop the uneven, labored breathing, or the fact that you now have snot covering the entire lower half of your face. When I tell you it went dead silent, I want to remind you that I was following this noise until I felt like I was right on top of it. There’s no goddamn way I wouldn’t have been able to hear them after they quieted down. \n\nI turned tail and ran back home. My brain immediately realized that I was the naive white woman running into a problem that was absolutely none of my business. Not only was I that bitch in the horror movie, but I THRIVE off of cryptids podcasts. I KNOW that there are cryptids that emulate a crying human. WHY would I run head first into that kind of situation???? \n\n\nAnyways yeah. So that’s the story of how I narrowly escaped being killed by a wendigo (probably not lmfao but still)",

I politely and quickly ended the conversation. She then kept circling around in her vehicle and trying to stop me, though I kept walking, swiftly.

My friend Alvin and I spent quite a bit of time there, that night on the other hand, was the wrong night for us to choose to go out.\n\nIt was around mid-August; the sun was down but everything remained unveiled.  The sky was absent of clouds, the moon was in full, and the night was illuminated more than I wish it had been. It’s later than what’s regarded as a safe hour, especially in this type of area.  As Alvin and I were winding down and getting ready to head back home, we see two shady looking men headed into the park towards the pavilions. We can hear these two talking but can’t make out much of what they’re saying. While discussing if we should make a break for it or wait it out, we hear a third voice which seemed to be beckoning the two men who just entered the park. At that point, the decision was made for us to just wait it out in fear of being seen leaving the park. We figured it our best option, being as we were well hidden, covered in the shadows, and can peer on them through gaps in the playground equipment. It was unclear at the time what these three men were doing other than snippets of conversation I caught, it sounded like they were conducting some sort of business transaction (the kind of business one would expect late at night when no ones around) which quickly took a turn, from confrontation to excruciation to silence…\n\n\nThe sound was horrifying, a repeated crash of bone on a solid surface created a hollow echo, surrounded by screams of pain, exasperated cries for help, wet respirations, then nothing. Silence filled the air, the pattering of two sets of feet scurrying away, the buzz from the street lamps, the melody of crickets, it all faded away. The draw of his final breath had exhausted the worlds resonance, leaving it mute. I remained motionless, slumped down in the woodchips that covered the floor of the playground, absent of thought and lost in the confusion of what I had just witnessed. \nAfter what felt like an eternity of silent bewilderment, Alvin and I turned to look at each other, perhaps seeking some resolve on what had just happened. We didn’t need to say anything, the pure terror that emanated from our eyes had spoken for us. It took an immense amount of self-persuasion to finally pick myself up. I turned to the scene only to be filled with sickness and sorrow. A dull flood light mounted on the wall of the pavilion shined down on the once white porcelain sink, now stained red. The lifeless body rested upon the cold concrete, a mess of carnage replaced where a face once belonged. The details will forever remain extremely vivid to me...",

I yelled at my friend for relatiating and that the men were getting out of the SUV. I saw a tractor trailer sitting in the parking lot of the gas station and we hauled ass over to it. Banging on the door to wake up anyone who might be inside. Thankfully the trucker woke up, came out, and scared the guys off while we made a run for it.

I started petting the shit out of them, most of the dogs just ignored me and a couple came up to get pet. My heart was thumping so hard, I could feel my pulse in my vision. They walked the couple other blocks home with me like some true homies.  I told my roommate about it the next day and he legit was just like \"yeah, the big packs of dogs aren't anything to fuck with, they've mauled people before\" craziest shit and still look back and can feel that fear. 15 dogs just eating you raw.

The fence we were walking past had only recently been erected. There was a small gap underneath the fence, and I initially thought that my dog had just managed to get his head stuck, because he can be a bit of an idiot.\n\nI had to kneel down, and use all of my strength to pull him back. I couldn't really see what was happening, because it was dark. Every time I go over the memory of that night, I feel so awful for scalding my dog, and for making him walk on. He was so quiet. It wasn't until we got to the next house that I noticed the blood... So much blood... The sound of it dripping onto the concrete will haunt me forever.\n\nI didn't know what to do. My dog is just a bit too big and heavy for me to carry. I could tell from the blood spurting everywhere that my dog was badly injured, but I couldn't tell what exactly was going on, or where exactly he was injured. \n\nMy phone was almost dead. I tried calling my mum's mobile, but it rang out. I then tried calling our home phone, but the same thing happened. No-one answered. I knew that there wasn't enough time to wait around, and I didn't have enough charge left in my phone to make any more phone calls, so I had no other choice - I had to force my severely injured dog to walk the rest of the way home.\n\nMy memory is a bit hazy, because I was obviously in shock, so I don't actually remember leaving a message on our answering machine, but I must have, because as we got closer to our house, my parents ran out to meet us. My mum yelled at my dad to go back inside, and grab a towel to wrap our dog in, and to grab the phone to call the vet. I remember my mum saying 'half his face is gone'. I wanted to throw up.\n\nI was hysterical.\n\nThankfully, the vet was still at her surgery, and told my parents to bring our dog straight out. My parents tried to get me to stay at home, but I couldn't... I still hadn't seen my dog's face, because my parents had been so swift at bundling him up in towels. Mum's words about half of his face being gone messed me up so much, and there was no fucking way that I was going to let them take him away, and leave me at home, because I was scared that they weren't ever going to bring him home.\n\nI insisted on going to the vets with my parents. Even though it's only 7km away, it seemed like one of the longest drives of my life.\n\nThe moment that we were ushered into the examination room, and our dog was placed onto the table for our vet to examine him was the moment that I was finally able to see what had happened... Mum wasn't joking - literally half of our poor dog's face was gone. What was left was a shredded, bloody mess. I was still under the impression that I had caused this to happen, and that I had somehow managed to cut his face on the fence, but our vet reassured me that would have been impossible, and that the wounds were indicative of another dog mauling mine...\n\nThe other dog had grabbed my dog's head from underneath the fence that my dog had been calmly sniffing. It was like a silent assassin. I hadn't even realised it was there.\n\nThe vet straight up asked us if we'd like her to euthanize our dog, or if we'd prefer to have her attempt to reconstruct his face, so that he could at least breathe properly. We knew that he was never going to look like a 'normal' dog again, but knew that our vet wouldn't have offered to reconstruct his face, if she didn't think that she was able to do it, and didn't think that it would affect his quality of life.\n\nMy parents were SO angry at me, because I insisted on taking photos of my dog's wounds, but I had this feeling that I HAD to do it...\n\nBecause of the tension, my dog was getting super upset, so everyone said it would be for the best if I waited outside... It was so harrowing, waiting, not knowing what was going on inside, or if my dog was going to be alright.\n\nThe vet was able to do a much better job than I was expecting... The tissue loss was extensive - he has no flews, and only the teeniest bit of his nose pad remains. It took about three hours, and countless stitches, but she was able to stitch a lot of the shredded tissue back together. I'm still not entirely sure just how she managed to do it, but she was able to stitch what was left of his nose pad down, so it wasn't just hanging there. Unfortunately, one of his 'nose holes' closed over, because there was nothing providing stability, but the other side has remained good.\n\nWe were expecting to have to leave him out there for a week or so, but the next day, we got a phone call to 'please come out and pick up your dog'! Apparently, they had maxed out the amount of tranquilizers that they could safely give him, but our dog did not wish to calm down... He LOVES going to see our vet, and thinks that he owns the joint! Even though any other dog would be meek and mild following such a traumatic event, our dog was SO buzzed about being at the vets!!\n\nI'm not going to lie... His recovery sucked. We had to keep an eye on his wounds for any signs of infection or necrosis. We had to try to medicate him several times a day, and he HATES taking tablets! We had to take him outside to poo/pee on a lead every several hours, so that he couldn't accidentally bump into anything and hurt himself. I had to hand feed him tiny bits of food, being very careful not to accidentally touch his wounds. He didn't want to be alone, and wanted to be with me more than anyone else. I was suffering badly from PTSD, and looking at his poor little face was incredibly triggering. He would have coughing fits, and would hack up big globs of blood, and I wondered if we'd done the right thing by prolonging his life.\n\nThankfully, he recovered. He is back to being his usual derpy self, and we definitely did the right thing!",

So without causing panic i took my brother went home and while walking home the whole time I felt like we were being watched and followed but to my surprise we weren’t but then again it’s now 9-10 at night and I’m on edge trying not to panic. Made it home safe and learned maybe go to the park durning the day next time.",

And I live near an area where there is a fair amount of crime and drug abuse. \n\nI have never been robbed or mugged. And I know people who have. So when I walk, at night when it’s cooler, I have my head on a swivel. \n\nI came around the corner to go about four blocks to my house at the end of a walk. It was dark, a streetlight was out. It was very late. I may have been two drinks in. It doesn’t matter. \n\nWhat matters is when I rounded the corner, there was a man, wearing a baseball cap, about a half block away, covered in shadow. And he was sort of *crouching* by a set of stairs. And I stopped on the street dead cold because in the shadow I could sort of tell his head was a little turned. As if he was staring at me. \n\nI waited. He waited. I was terrified. I swear I would see him move — almost imperceptibly — just…waiting. \n\nI knew if I went backwards, he would run at me. And if I stayed there, he would finally screw up the courage to come at me. So here we were. Me, paralyzed on the street. Him, lying in wait. \n\nI think I stood there three minutes before I could move my legs. And what got me to move was one thought: if you stay here, he will jump and run at you. So *move.*\n\nWhat I did next surprised me. Instead of turning and running away — where I would not be able to see him, if I ducked around a corner — I walked briskly *toward* him.  \n\n“Hey, motherfucker! HEY! I see you, you fucking cocksucker!”  Top of my lungs. And I put a hand in my pocket, to make him think I had a knife or something. \n\nAs I walked toward him, the wind kicked up leaves around him, and he moved. But hesitantly. This gave me confidence. \n\n“I FUCKING SEE YOU, MAN! I Don’t know what you think you are doing, but I FUCKING SEE YOU.”  \n\nI was now angry as much as afraid, and to this day I don’t know how I got the courage to run up to him, one hand in a fist drawn back, one hand pointing at him. “I FUCKING SEE YOU!!”\n\nI got close and it was a small pile of garbage bags.",

A friend and I were creeping around the neighborhood of our little town at around midnight, just because we were 14 years old and just being out and about, not up to anything in particular. We were wearing all black clothing and ski masks to blend in better, because it felt 'cool' to hide when a car passed by, and remain the unobserved kids of the night. Anyways we were passing by some house and a car comes down the road so we hid in the shrubs in the front yard. The car just happened to be going to that same house, they pulled in the driveway and out gets a teenage girl by herself, just making it home before curfew, talking on her cell phone to whoever she just left. We remained hiding in the shrubs because we were kinda committed at this point, no way to leave without being spotted. She paces around the yard for a few minutes while talking on the phone and eventually gets too close to the shrubs. We lost our nerve and both just stood up about 5 feet away from her. She screamed like you hear in a horror movie and my friend and I both turned around and bolted around the corner and out of sight.\n\nShe probably never went out by herself at night again.",

            "text": "Aw man, I'm gonna get shit for this one, but here goes. A shadow thing we just referred to as \"the 8ft tall guy\".\n\nGonna keep this short. It was around new years in 2000 and I was 18. Had 6 friends over to hang out since parents were going to be out really late. I lived in the middle of the woods out in the country (in the Midwest). There is a big machine shed about 200 yards away from the house lit up by a stadium light (there is another in front of the house, so the surrounding yards were dimly lit).\n\nWe had left a bunch of liquor up at the bar in the shed and 3 of us start walking up there while the others were in the house. When we were about 50ft away, we see this person-like figure BOLT out of the shed (the main door is always open) and run into the trees. And I mean FAST. It was maybe 10 feet from that ight, yet somehow none of us could see anything but it's shape. We naturally thought some dipshits were robbing my shed and we were a bit spooked, but being young redneck boys with an overdeveloped sense of cowboyism, I told one friend to run back to get the others and my gun. Me and the other friend waited under the light.\n\nMy friend and I saw the figure right away. That whole timber to the west there has very low weed cover and the trees are spread evenly apart which made it easy to watch it. As we strained to keep an eye on it through the dimly lit trees, it started moving around slowly. We watched as it stepped behind a tree and just... vanished. The tree wasn't thick - maybe 9 inches in diameter - but the figure stepped behind it on one side and simply didn't appear on the opposite side.\n\nNow my friend and I'd adrenaline spiked as we whisper hurriedly things like \"WTF\" and \"Did you see that?\" As we are quizzing each other and panning around to find it, the rest of the group came running up. One friend had the smarts to hop in his car and drive up so his headlights could light up the whole scene. My friend handed me my 22 rifle, and apparently decided to bring all the REST of my guns (2 pistols and a shotgun - so now a fairly armed group). We were hicks, but we were nerdy hicks, so I'm sure we looked quite the site. \n\nWe all see the thing as it casually yet purposefully steps out from behind a different tree than before. Now everyone is in edge as every signal in my brain screamed \"alarm something's not right alarm\". We all sensed it and saw what we each saw, but no one spoke at that time. We were too fixated and shocked at what we were seeing. Later in the night as we all sat around sharing our perception of what happened, we all said the same things we couldn't comprehend at the time.\n\nWhen it stepped out, it didn't cast a shadow. The headlights and fixed lamp were casting plenty of light into the trees now and the trees shadows and our shadows were there - but not this thing. Its head was narrower and longer than normal. It's arms too. And it was *tall* - hence the \"8ft tall guy\" moniker.. It moved briskly to another tree and disappeared like before. A few moments later, it walked out from behind a different tree 10 feet away in the opposite direction. It was like it teleported. It then repeated this game several more times. All this allowed us to get plenty of eyes on it, but not me or anyone else could *describe* it. It's like the lights lit up everything around it, but not the thing itself. Except the eyes, we all agreed it had silver eyes but the crazy part? We all only saw the eyes like out of our peripheral - they just weren't there if you looked at it dead on. \n\nAfter several minutes of this, I finally raised my rifle and tried to sound tough: \"This is private property and we are armed. Come towards us slowly and show yourself or I WILL shoot!\" That thing stopped dead in it's tracks, turned to face me and studied us for a moment, and then with purpose it extended a leg and stepped behind a tree that couldn't have been 4 inches wide and vanished.\n\nSeveral, SEVERAL minutes go by and nothing. We eventually decide to huddle up and go back to the house. The buddy in the car drives down ahead. We made it maybe 20 feet when a friend's gf starts screaming. The thing was following us about 50ft south of us, hugging the treeline. It moved *wrong* - like it was moving it's body from a pouncing, slightly crouched over posture to a sprint posture all while jogging slowly. It literally made your brain hit the brakes hard as it tried to make sense of the visual input. There's a great book by Stephen King called \"From a Buick 8\" where these cops come across this humanoid creature from another dimension that's so incredibly different from ourselves that their brains can't handle it, and they are overcome with fear so terribly that they beat the creature to death in a fit of insanity and fear and rage. Everytime I think back to that deep, instinctual fear that we felt that night and everytime I say the way it moved or looked or behaved was just *wrong*, I think of that scene in that book.\n\nCollectively, everyone that had a gun opened fire without a word - it was if we all had the same instinctual response. Now I can't speak for my friends, but I am and have always been a crack shot with a rifle. I was just raised hunting since I could walk, so I was shocked when I watched leaves blown apart and branches snap and dirt kick up as the collective firing of birdshot, 22, 38, and 44 ammo blow everything apart around that thing, but that thing itself never seemed to be hit.\n\nI'm going to sum up the rest as it went by in a blur. We all ran for the house when the ammo dried up. Some were already inside, including the dogs who were terrified of the thing. Or maybe they were scared of us, who knows. We huddled in the living room and waited. Soon we heard footsteps clattering across the porch (and I mean clatter as in the thing had nails of some sort, but let me tell you those sounds were strange and unique too). Next we heard it seemingly climbing up the side of the house behind us, click-click-click across the roof, and then a \"thud\" as it jumped 3 stories down to the ground. Then rinse and repeat on every side of the house, sometimes repeatedly and sometimes with minutes of pauses between. Eventually we escorted each other to the bathroom, and I and a friend saw it through the sliding glass deck doors as it launched itself over the deck railing (a 15ft drop there) as we walked back from the bathroom. \n\nFinally after what felt like an eternity, the thing seemed to stop. Not long after my parents car turned into our driveway. We all agreed to hightail it to my room bc no way we're trying to explain all of the guns out and what happened all night. As soon as we got to my room, someone did mention \"Shouldn't we warn them?\" We all had the feeling they would be ok so we didn't, but looking back telling this as an adult now good God yes we should have warned them. I had a large 2 room basement bedroom (it sounds fancier than it was, trust me) so we just got comfortable and turned my TV on. My parents came inside and eventually my mom poked her head in to say goodnight - none the wiser to all that we'd been through. We all tried to sleep soon after that and we all slept like hell, but it didn't bother us anymore that night.\n\nThroughout the rest of that year, there were several more credible sightings from everyone in the group. Even a couple more people got pulled into the story as they were with us when we'd see it again. I think about 11 people overall got to clearly \"see\" it that year. Nothing to write about because, well... How do I explain this. Have you ever noticed that when people want to ignore something, even something dangerous, they pretend it isn't happening? Like, okay yes we see this thing but there's nothing we can do about it or get closure on anything about it, so what can you do? You just... Go about your life, and if you happened to see it running towards you and your friend as you walk to the car at night, you both just hurry up, get in, lock the doors and speed off. And go in with your night. Rinse and repeat throughout the year.\n\nP.S. Yes, over the years I've tried to find info. The closest thing I've found is Native American and First Nations lore about \"shadow spirits\" and \"shadow people\", but they didn't seem to fit just right. And yes, I'm a very skeptical person. I am very married to science and common sense. But that thing, well, my brain just goes \"I got nothing, you're on your own buddy\". Maybe it was inter-dimensional, or an alien, or a demon, or some spirit. Except none of those answers feel right and most sound crazy as shit to me so I dunno. Even 20 years later, I still struggle with impulsively trying to downplay any of it because I can't explain it rationally.\n\nP.P.S. Yes, I still go into wooded areas at night in other places, I never fear anything happening. I LOVE camping. However, I inherited that same homestead a few years back and I notice I am uneasy as hell being outside at night here. I run a small farm there though so I have to be out after dark. I haven't seen anything yet and I hope I don't. Normally you know when it's around - your anxiety goes from zero to red line the moment you step into the dark and that's how you know it's coming. That hasn't happened yet, but the past few weeks something has been feeling a bit off. I don't carry a gun with me usually. I've convinced myself over the years that it's ultimately benign, so if I see it, I'm going to do my best to either ignore it, or converse with it. God help me.",

You just put a lot of reflecive gear on yourself and your horse, wear a helmet lamp and get on with it. \n\nOne night I chose a path through the woods that we’d been on many many times. It’s a sizeable forest, but not very remote. At any time of day you could expect to meet other riders, people walking their dogs etc. \n\nMy horse was relaxed as aways and we just did our thing until suddenly he stopped dead. Now, he gets spooked easily, but usually he just does a horse version of „OH what‘s this!?“ and after a few seconds he‘s fine. We’ve encountered plenty of wildlife on these rides and unless something actively jumps out at him from the undergrowth he’s not scared of other animals. \n\nThis time though, he just stopped and straight up refused to go on. When I wouldn‘t let him turn around he started shaking and was obviously terrified. I wanted to dismount and try to lead him down the path, but he was so nervous he wouldn‘t stand still and so I decided it was probably better just to turn around. He didn‘t calm down until we were back at the barn. \n\nA few days later I went past that spot again, but during the daylight hours. Horsie got nervous again, but not as bad as last time. A few meters down the path behind a curve there is a little clearing in the woods. Everything seemed fine at first but after a feew seconds I noticed that on multiple spots there was some kind of fabric on the ground, half covered by a mix of snow and mud. I dismounted and checked, the pieces of fabric were multiple items of either childrens or small womens clothing (a tshirt, a jacket, a pair of socks). Freaked me the fuck out. I checked missing persons records and wether any crime had been reported in the area but never found out anything.

It had a sorta weird shuffling run, like an injured paw or something.\n\nI grew up on a cattle ranch, summers in Mississippi, so I know how a horse, cow, deer and dogs move. I THINK it might have been a bear, but I watch to many horror movies to dismiss it out right.\n\nSo, my dog and I very much unsettled, went back into the house. Walk forgotten.",

There was a Marsh area to my right and woods and an open field to my left. I started to realise this was a bad idea and for some reason I got the idea of a body being dumped in the Marsh.\n\nI got distracted by a hungry stray kitten and dropped some food. Then about 50 strays all darted out from the darkness.\n\n I saw a car pull in and decided to hurry up and leave. I heard the car door shut and looked up. A man with his shirt off was walking silently and very quickly towards me. \n\nI just fucking RAN. I've seen enough true crime programmes to know this was dodgy as hell and I knew if i stopped running I would be another missing woman on the news. He was chasing me but I managed to have enough distance between me and him. Luckily I was wearing sneakers because of working out at the hotel gym prior. I was was also physically fit in terms of stamina back then. I'm pretty sure had I not ran immediately upon seeing him he would have caught me easily.\n\nI had to run past some dark woods before getting to the main road. I was getting tired but knew if i stopped i would be abducted raped and possibly murdered. I have never felt such a life or death fear in my entire life. \n\nOnce I got to the main road I ran across to a restaurant. I waited outside a second to get some composure and I looked back to the road I ran out of and he was there just looking at me, then turned around and left.\n\nI was too scared to walk past any dark patches of road to get back to the hotel (which i could see at this point). I went into the restaurant. I could not get my words out and started hyperventilating.

I know black bears generally scare easy, so I wasn’t overly worried… but I also know black bears can rip car doors off to get at a bag of Doritos… so there was also, trepidation, to say the least.",

I let her pet my dog and decide to walk at her speed as she's not fit to walk home at all. We met one of her friends who took over from there. All of this was in a residential zone so I didn't think of it at first but before I dropped her off I noticed a car pass by that was driving real slow past us. It passed us two times while walking and didn't see where she took off to. \n\nWhile walking home it passed me again, turned around and stopped. Blinding me with its headlights. I took a route through the graveyard to not walk past as I was freaked out at that point. Despite this the car passed me really slowly five more times before I got home. No clue what was up with that but I felt like I had disturbed a hunter who had been stalking a prey that night",

            "text": "There’s this creek next to my former place of work. I noticed one day it was just full of trash, oddly what seemed to be household waste. I started to clean it up, and eventually adopted it. I knew little of the area at the time. It was very odd to me that the creek was surrounded by dense woods when it’s literally in the middle of the city with two of the busiest roads on either side.\n\nI worked second shift so I would go out late at night to clean it up. The further I cleaned, the more household trash I’d find. I didn’t know where it was all coming from. One night I got to what appeared to be an open field along the creek. It was pitch black and I only had a headlamp for light. Trash glistens at night, so it’s honestly much easier to see the trash than during the day. I stood in the field with my headlamp shining and slowly turned in place. The entire field glistened with garbage. Upon further inspection I saw there were SEVERAL tents ripped to shreds. Mattresses and blankets thrown about. There were broken tables/chairs, and the creepiest of children’s toys. There was one GIANT tree whose trunk had been hallowed out completely and could easily fit 4-5 people inside of it. The inside of it smelled awful- like rotting meat. I could sense there used to be a community of some sort in the area, but definitely not anymore. And what kind of community exactly? It looked like completely abandoned war zone. I got a sickly eerie feeling afterwards and stopped cleaning up late at night.\n\nUpon actually researching the area (which I definitely should have done before adopting it lol), I found out the creek and wooded area along side it used to be home to a bustling tent city that the homeless had established. Colorado Springs did something really shitty many years back and blatantly made being homeless illegal. No pitching tents or any sort of shelter within city limits whatsoever. Instead of helping those who were experiencing a housing crisis, the city came through one day and just.. destroyed god damn everything. Everyone’s homes, what little they had, and they just left the debris there. Didn’t even mind picking any of it up. Now whenever it rains heavily, the area floods and little by little everything that was tore down by the city washes into the creek and makes its way slowly down. Explains all the “household waste” I was finding throughout.\n\nThis was years ago I still think of that area to this day. Mostly about the people who lived there and how traumatic it must have been to have the city come and just rampage through. I could feel the despair in the air that was left behind and it’s something I’ll never be able to forget.\n\n(The dead body smell I encountered in the hallowed out tree was this shitty local who would dump fucking fish guts and nasty shit inside the tree so the homeless couldn’t use it for shelter anymore. I chewed him out one day while waving the trash grabber I used as if it was a weapon to come off as a crazy person to scare him. It worked. Never saw him again. Damn beavers got to that majestic tree though and chewed it down).\n\nSorry- no happy ending. Just Colorado Springs being Conservative Colorado Springs.",

I'm used to the trail and can see well in the dark, but no moon and a lot of tree cover made this area very dark. *Cue spooky music*  I heard a very loud noise off to side in the trees close to me and thought that I might have spooked a bear (not a healthy thing) and wanted to move out of the area without an encounter. About a quarter mile later I hear the noise again just off to my left in the trees.  This time, a massive elk walks out in front of me and stands on the path. It was within touching distance.  Another second later, a couple more elk walk across the path while the bull I'm trying not to piss off just looks at me like I owe him money.  Knowing this is not normal behavior, I just hold very still and the other elk walk off. The bull waits and turns to look at me again before walking on his way with the others.  I've had a lot of, \"One with nature,\" moments but the elk definitely was letting me know this was not one of them.

I find this both a little funny and a little annoying. I assume he's out late for some reason and just been caught short before he can make it home.

It also looks like the only non-abandoned building for miles.\nIt’s surrounded by like a half acre of grass, and behind it is a tree line that I’m assuming leads to, you guessed it, more abandoned houses.  \nSo now I’m walking inside. The clerk is talking to someone on the phone while looking at me, but hangs up super quick once I get within earshot. He also gives me sketch vibes - doesn’t make eye contact, not friendly, I don’t think he even said a word to me. Whatever. Gave him my $ and go out to pump it. I’m at the pump and it takes a minute to work. I’m waving to dude to kind of signal it’s being weird, but he’s not paying attention. Just as I’m about to go inside to tell him, he looks up and gives me a thumbs up, like to say it should be fine now.\nI start pumping it and as I’m pumping it, I see something weird out of the corner of my eye towards the tree line. I turn my head to see like 4 grown men literally RUNNING STRAIGHT TOWARDS ME FROM OUT OF THE TREE LINE.\n\nI yank the thing out of my tank, leave it hanging, jump in and peel DAFUCK outta there so fast.

Just hearing whatever crunch through that forest still puts my entire body into shivers typing this. It’s near a river that the natives used to use and I just kept thinking about how I couldn’t be afraid as I would literally go missing and nobody would suspect anything as I normally blade around that time anyways.

The altitude wouldn’t change. Hour after hour, I’m still up on the ridge. I had this awesome Suntu compass watch that I’d gotten for a dollar at the L.L. Bean Employee store, and I found myself checking it constantly. Watching the time pass. I knew how far I should have gone, but it was like I wasn’t moving. The slope was still wrong. \n\nFinally, around 1:30am, the trail finally started to drop again. To my exhausted mind, I was *finally* about three miles from the next shelter and as I had no tent, I was determined to keep going. \n\nThen I see this SAME fucking rock. \n\nYeah, things had felt wrong for awhile.

I shit you not it was standing completely still and just staring, it made no indication that it even noticed me bike past. Also, I’ve biked past this house many times and have never seen a car in the driveway. I chalked it up to, “maybe it’s a weird ass Halloween decoration?” Because I was going so fast, I was past the house in an instant, but I just got a tingly sense that it was a real person and like a dumbass I decided to turn back and take another look.

I have definitely made some poor decisions in my brief time on our spinning magma-rock, however I have always found that drunk Humtar often treats himself better to nightly self care/cleaning rituals than sober Humtar (I know, sad ain’t it). Anywho, I’m in my house in Vermont and I have three people staying with me and I’m pretty sure they’re all hooking up or some shit. I go to bed and distinctly remember putting myself to sleep. \n\nFast forward to morning. I wake up, alone, naked…which is a little unusual for me because I’m an underwear sleeper. I am a roller-turner-starfish when I sleep so I think to myself “I probably pulled them off in my snoozles.” I look in my bed and around the floor of my room, and they are NOWHERE to be found. Curious…however upon inspecting my room I happen to find a BATHMAT?!?! Like a mini towel. WTF. I think okay, inspect the house. I walk out of my room and proceed to walk down the stairs to the kitchen, and low and behold my underwear is in the stairwell. OMG. Mortified me has no inclination as to the events that proceeded (like did I make a fool of myself or try to join the threesome or worse hurt someone else in any capacity?). My guests all claim to have not seen or know anything. Still perturbed to this day by that and uncontrollable actions. \n\n2) Few years back in the before-times, I was working in NYC at a fancy restaurant and living in SoHo (300 bucks a month believe it or not). It’s a few weeks before Christmas and it’s chilly but everything is lit up so beautifully. I have a buddy, let’s call him Mark, who came down to NYC from VT to work at one of those Christmas tree stands they have in big cities. It’s pretty good money for a short amount of time (six weeks). However, seeing as it’s Mark’s first time doing this, the company gave him a pretty shotty situation. He’s up in central/East Harlem above central park, AND he is on the night shift (I think it was 9pm to 9am). However they also paid for meals (I think 25$ a day) and housed him too for free (it was definitely crappy situations tho)\n\nAnyways he’d tell me stories about having to shoo off PCP users tweaking in the Christmas trees and people falling face first into the pavement. Rough spot. \n\nEvery once in a while I would go up and visit him. He had this little makeshift shack that we would smoke some herb in (can’t handle my shit anymore) and hotbox, and I would usually bring a bottle of sparkling wine (or two) to sip on while we chilled for an hour or two. I did this probably 4 times and never had any incidence. \n\nTIME 5: (omg) So I get off of my shift and head up to meet him. Prolly don’t arrive until like 12:30 am (I’m coming from FiDi). I meet up with him and we do our usual thing and hang out. It was extra cold this day so we spent a lot of time in his little hut. TBH we never really locked it when we were in it, however, I was sitting closest to the door and something just fucking compelled me to lock it this spontaneous instance. We hear some rusting and banging and murmuring from the non-visible side of the hut. THIS DUDE fucking pops around the corner of the hut (there’s a small plexiglass window in the door) and he’s wielding an EIGHT INCH BLADE screaming “I’m gunna fucking kill you, you f—-ts”(we no homo, just homIES) and is repeating yanking and shaking the door and telling us to “open up”. We are so startled by this and we’re both looking around, like, what are we going to wield in self-defense god forbid that door or plexi gives out. My choice is a drill and my buddy’s was his guitar (what a fucking tale THAT would’ve been). This man was probably screaming and hollering and banging and wielding his knife for like 30 secs (felt like thirty minutes) and then the HALAL FOOD TRUCK MAN who is like 35 feet away saves our fucking lives and jumps out of his FT brandishing an enormous meat cleaver and chases mr “crackhead(?)” away. We call the cops but nothing comes of it. \n\nMy friend also calls his boss at like 2:30 in the morning and says that he’s not super comfortable staying here all alone anymore with crazed 8” blade dude running around threatening people, and ultimately ends up coming back to my place that night and staying two days. Mark quit that job but still made bank for the three weeks he was there for.\n\nAhhhh, good times.",

A homeless guy in a sleeping bag came up to me yelling at me about how I woke him up. Ironically, it took me a while to figure out what he was talking about because the sound of the traffic on the highway was too loud to actually hear him.\n\nWalking at night along a stream in a nature preserve, some guy was sitting below a tree and decided to get up and walk with me. Was friendly. Kept asking if I knew (insert name) at the University. I explained I didn't go to the college. He replied by saying that they'd be happy to hear from him. Then he turned to the other side and spoke to someone else, but we were both alone. Then he started speaking to some other third person, and I realized he thought we were walking in a group of people, and wasn't actually speaking to me, which explains why he kept cutting me off.\n\nWalking at night in the city, some kid on a scooter followed me around and kept ridding in circles yelling at me. I told him to go fuck off. Then he called someone and a guy in a white truck started following me. I was able to walk off where it was pedestrian only and called an Uber. Uber driver said it could probably be people who go out \"looking for blood\" trying to justify beating someone up by egging them on.\n\nWalking at night through the desert, I looked behind myself and noticed I was being followed. I stood for a moment turned around to assess how far off they were and immediately realized they were running towards me. My walk turned into a run and I lost them. I don't know what they wanted.",

Small enough that everyone knows everyone we have a few smaller villages around us and everyone knows everyone living there aswell.\n\nAt the time I had a lot of friends about 5km away from my town back then we would have to hitch hike or get a bus to see each other however the town made a very long bike lane near the wheat fields going through some of the villages and thats what we used to meet up just walk the 5km and come back whenever needed. \n\nWhen this happened my friends were adamant that none was walking on the bike path in the dark due to some creeps hanging around. If I had to walk back in the dark at least 2 or 3 guys would walk me all the way to my door drunk or high it didn't matter they would still walk me.\n\nOne night I needed to be home at a certain time but my friends were too drunk to walk me I was about to go on my own  but my male friend said to me that if I go they will be looking for my body in the morning. That scared me but my female friend offered to walk me half way.\n\nSo we walked and it was dark as fuck couldn't see more then 1m infornt of us with phone flash lights on almost got ran over by 3  cyclists because you couldn't see them until they were on top of you. We reached the half way point and my friend said good night and went back and I continued to walk. \n\nIt was a warm night so I was just vibing until I reached the bridge you see there is a turn of high bushes and due to that you can't see who is behind the bend until you there but what was more weird was when I was walking up on it in the headlights of the oncoming cars I could see a guy walking on the side of the busy road.\n\nThis set of all the alarm bells he appeared to be drunk as I saw him swaying in the lights. Nobody walks on the actual road anymore I decided to walk faster as I wasn't too far away from my town now. I cleared the bridge and breathed a sigh of relief that no-one was there until I heard a thud behind me like something heavy dropped .\n\nI turned around and looked back to see if I can make out what the sound was but no go so I continued walking I was on a straight road and could see the outskirts of my town now. As I walked something told me I have to turn around so I did just as there was a car coming so I could see whats behind me due to the headlights \n\nBehind me was a guy I didn't see him before nor heard him behind me I thought ok weird. Kept walking few seconds later I again turned around as a car was coming this time the guy disappeared but due to the high beams of the car I realised that the guy was  hiding  in the wheat just out of sight. \n\nNow I was like wtf is going on why is he hiding i started speed walking the next car that passed I turned around and he was right behind me within reach crouching down I freaked out and started hauling ass towards my town. Once I got there I waited to see if the dude came out but I never saw him come out.\n\nWhat I believe happened was when I heard the thud it was him that jumped down from the road he must of seen me walking alone in the headlights of the cars. \n\nI have no idea what he was planning to do to me in that heavy wooded area but I'm glad I didn't find out and my friend was eerily almost correct about my fate.",

            "text": "I had a peculiar experience walking round the grounds of a local stately home and park. It's a big, beautiful place and if you're walking at night you're unlikely to ever see another soul. \n\nOne night, as I left my friends house on my bike, I decided to ride home via the park and pull up at the top of the parks golf course (which is it's own wing of the park). As I approached the first tee, riding a path that cut through a 200 foot ish thicket of woodland in the pitch black, I was hit with an overwhelming stench. \nI thought nothing of it and kept pushing to the first tee. The smell past and i gave it no further thought. \n\nI took a seat on a bench on the first tee that overlooks my home city, and admired the view (and the immensely clear, starry sky). I popped open my bag and grabbed my rolling supplies to enjoy a cheeky number to accompany my 'not a care in the world' mindset. (Important to note I've only had 2 beers at this point)\n\nAs I began to roll; i had an eerie feeling i was being watched. I kept looking back over my shoulder though I was unable to see anything through the darkness of the wood thicket behind me. I sped up my roll and had almost completed it when the stench from earlier returned. \n\nThis time it was so potent it stung my nostrils. I immediately thought 'gas leak'; it was rotten eggs on steroids. Before I could give it a second thought, I hear a little girl giggle from the darkness behind me.\n\nI'm now slightly dumbfounded, why would someone bring their clearly very young daughter to the park at 3am. I called out into the darkness of the woods with a simple 'hello there, you guys okay?', nothing. Perhaps they'd already moved on? Or had I in fact imagined it? \n\nMy question was answered quite quickly after. Listening to my gut (telling me there is something slightly strange about all this) I packed my bag back up rather quickly on the off chance i needed to leave suddenly. I stood up and put the bag on my back and called once more into the darkness, the sense of being watched was now to the point of certainty. It made me as uncomfortable as can be (and I'm not typically a fearful individual. I'm 6'3 and could handle myself if necessary). The stench was now unbearable to the point I was breathing through my mouth, when suddenly - no more than 10 feet away the little girls giggle comes back, exactly the same as the last giggle, but this time came directly from the shade of a few trees just to my left. I spun my torch on the location and could see the area was empty, those specific trees were thin and spindly in nature and couldn't hide a person. I scanned the entire wood thicket surrounding me and saw nothing, though I still felt there was someone there.\n\nI was now terrified and felt frozen to the ground. The smell somehow continued to get progressively worse and I now somehow felt surrounded. The final straw was a sharp tug on my bag. I flung round with my elbow sticking out and made contact with nothing, then in the same motion reached down to scoop my bike off the floor and I fled as fast as it could possibly carry me down the sheer slopes of the first and second holes and didn't stop til I got home. (About a mile and a half - 2 miles away)\n\nTerrifying experience, don't think I've felt fear like it. I've told many a person this tale, and one or two have given me some in return. It would seem there is something active in those woods.",

Buddy went to pull over on the shoulder and didn’t realize the grass was cut evenly with the road but the ditch was a forty five degree grade. Truck goes kitty wompas and almost rolls. After trying to unfuck the truck we both exit out the drivers door and start the long walk back into town to get help getting out of the ditch. We start talking about this and that as we walk and start drinking the beers we brought with. About an hour into our trudge I get a weird feeling of being watched. I stopped and looked to my side and there’s a shimmering massive shape looking back at me. It was a black bull right at the barbed wire fence twelve feet from me staring me down. Once we yelled at him to try and spook him and he didn’t flinch we started walking again, trying to ignore him away. He followed us, never leaving our side and barely making a sound as he walked. I wondered how long he’s been following us? How big is the property he’s on? I also wondered why his owner let him keep his horns and if the bull knew he could easily jump the fence? The longer he followed us the more I thought about that giant black bull hopping the fence and goring the both of us then leaving us for dead. Would anyone find us in time? It was a desolate area and we hadn’t seen headlights in any direction so far. We finally hit the end of the bulls domain. He stood in the corner of the fencing watching us walk until we were far enough away that we were unable to see if he was still there. I kept thinking he was going to come charging from behind us, our only warning being the noise of loose gravel being flung from his hooves as he went from walking silently to a full sprint bearing down on us to close the gap. I’ve never looked over my shoulder as many times in a row as I did that night. I kept at it until we finally hit the outskirts of town and had streetlights to illuminate our path home.",

I like to drive down back roads and whatnot in the early AMs, when you pass a car every 30 minutes or so, and the only light is from the moon and your headlights. It's extremely cathartic. Many mental breakdowns saved from it.\n\nAnywho, I was perusing areas and I found this military... Thing, base, testing place? Not entirely sure, but it was surrounded by some pretty thick woods but with clearly often-used dirt roads, they were very compact, and even showed up on Google maps. I drive a city car so I figured it'd be fine. After passing gates (passing, not going through them) explaining I'll be shot if I go through them, and many mine field warning signs, I felt pretty uncomfortable after seeing that a bunch, so I decided to get out of dodge, and I saw on Google maps that there was a path leading straight to the main road. Perfect! So I drive down this path, and I realize... Uh oh, this dirt road is more like sugar sand, and I'm gliding more than rolling, so I tell myself I cannot stop or I will get stuck. Unfortunately, I did indeed get stuck. Couldn't go forward, couldn't go backwards. Fuck.\n\nSo i decide to try to call nearby family. Closest is my mother and step dad. Mind you, this is in the middle of bum fuck nowhere with the spottiest connection ever. Thank God GPS uses satellites or I'd have no idea where I was. I finally managed to get in contact with my mom, and her and step dad come my way to save me, like 2 hours away. But they don't really have a means of getting the car out. So I call AAA, and ask em if they can come save me, they tell me that they don't have anything equipped for the roads to come save my car. Fuck. I asked the lady what I should do, since I'm in the middle of a forest in the middle of the night, and she told me I should prolly call 911. So I did, and explained my situation and my location best I could. Funny how I could see them tap into my location data cause I saw the location circle expand huge once I called them. Anyway, she tells me someone will come my way, and I should probably head towards the road I was trying to get to to meet up with them. My mother and step dad were coming from that direction as well and I didn't want them to get stuck on the same path so I decided to start walking towards them. Mind you, this is in Florida, so I am wearing flip flops and shorts. But this is in winter, and the middle of the night. So it's like 30-40 degrees. Not death, but damn chilly. So I start walking down this long path, trying not to think about what could be lurking in the trees around me, and on this dirt path, I start to see these absolutely massive footprints, they had to be a bear's or some huge wolf or something, I have no idea. I was thoroughly spooked and debated walking back to the car since it seemed safer, but I was already very far, so I figured I'd keep going.\n\nEventually met up with mother, and we spent half a day trying to get my car out. We called my uncle who has a truck and tried to pull it out, didn't work. Eventually some dudes who came out 4x4ing in a jeep came around and said they got stuck in the exact same spot and helped us pull the car out. Told us they were helped by random strangers themselves, and were repaying the favor.\n\nNot a single cop came btw. Thanks 911 operator. Props to the random jeep dudes.

As I was nearing the end of the alleyway, a hooded man with a clown mask nonchalantly walked right out of the corner, suddenly jumped when he saw me, and then went around me and slowly walked right past me.  I was so scared that I just ran as quickly as possible straight to the apartment door, which was only like 30m away from the alleyway. \n\nMy parents still think that I just ‘imagined’ the hooded man with the clown mask out of fear, but I remember him clear as day.

We’re on our honeymoon let’s go to a flash hotel. \n\nWe went to this pretty fancy place right in town overlooking a river and after getting checked in we went out for dinner.  I asked the concierge about a place we found online and if it was possible to walk there and he said go for it just don’t go past the underpass as you’ve gone too far and it’s not the best area. \n\nWell after 5-10 mins of walking along the river we couldn’t find the place and decided to head back to the hotel and just get room service. That decision made us turn around in time to startle the bag snatcher that was about to grab my new wife’s handbag. The guy pulled a knife but made a large semicircle around us then once past us took off running at lightning speed.   It scared the absolute hell out of us but then to top it off we were getting stalked pretty much the whole way back to the hotel by this completely other shady character whom we hadn’t noticed before. \n\nWhen we got back to the hotel we told the concierge what happened and he rang the police however there was nothing they could do.",

Im not kidding you, there was a known dealer close to my town, i like to go for walks before my job starts and on fridays i always start at 4am so that the weekend starts sooner. So im walking on a small path in the woods beside the complex where the dealer was. All i heard was a loud \"thump\" a light turned on, the window opened, 3 figures, one of wich was trying to fight back (the dealer), and in like half a minute they tied him up and put a gag in his mouth, put a noose arround him and trew him out the window. I was on the phone with the police and they knew who i was talking about, all they said was to turn arround and just run. I was contacted latter by the police to ask me if the other people saw me, or anything like that to know if i needed protection. As the dealer was involved with some ukranian or polish mafia, and they were affraid that if i was spotted i could be a target. Luckly that was 8 years ago and nothning happend since. Tho his face, muffled gags and scream still haunt me some nights.",

            "text": "Mountain Lion. In northern Illinois. I work security on overnights watching a facility that’s out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by woods on all sides. I’m the only one there at night, and I like to walk my patrols most of the time. A couple months ago, I was walking the fenceline, and the hair on the back on my neck stood up, and I got that uneasy feeling you get when a predator is watching you from somewhere. I’ve spent a lot of time in the woods at night in my life, so I know what that feeling means. I began to look around, only expecting to see a small pack of coyotes or something, since that’s about the only real predator we typically have in Illinois. Instead, I see this big freaking brown cat standing on the other side of the fence, about 15 feet from me, just looking at me. After a couple seconds, I realized I was looking at a mountain lion, and my heart about jumped out of my chest. I knew we’ve had them in the area before, because displaced lone males often pass through from out west, looking for new territory. The DNR shot and killed one a few years ago on a farm in my county, and there have been several officially confirmed sightings each year since then. So I knew we had them. But it’s still not something I EXPECTED to see. I was a few hundred yards from the main building, so I started slowly walking back along the fenceline, keeping my eyes on it the entire time. The big cat just started kind of loping alongside the fence, matching my stride. It was about that moment I realized that the cat could EASILY jump the fence between us if it wanted to. The urgency to get back to the main building intensified, but I still kept my pace even and smooth. I finally made it back and stepped inside, and kept watching him through the windows. He just stood there on the other side of the fence for a while watching the door, until he finally got bored and turned around and walked back into the woods. I went out later and finished my patrol, and saw no sign of him. Haven’t seen him since then, so I’m assuming he was a transient male like most, and has since moved on.\n\nMy thoughts when I saw him were: 1. “Whoa, that’s a BIG cat.” 2. “Wait... that’s not a normal cat.” 3. “Oh shit.”",

Some UFOs (lights in a triangular formation, in a neighborhood of a small city). The creepiest thing was I was visiting family and went out to part of the farm in my car to look at stars like I did as a kid. Seemingly out of no where my uncle pops up with a flashlight and a pistol. He goes walking at night in the dark down the main road for excercise. The pistol is for self defense of any wild animals. He didn't recognize my car, so we actually scared each other.\n\nIronically the one time I was walking trails in the national forest at night nothing happened. I had planned a longer hike and got started a little later than I intended and I slipped and fell down a creek embankment and hit my ankle about 5 miles in. So I proceed to walk slowly to finish the hike. Let people know it will be longer for my return. I had multiple backup flashlights. I play podcasts from my phone speaker so I don't encounter any crepuscular wildlife and hobble for a few hours in the dark. I did lose the trail once or twice (there had been places where they had moved the trail, so fining the newer trail was the trick)m for the final mile which involved a lot of up and down due to crossing a lot of tributary creeks, I decided to cut down a forestry track that ran a few hundred yards due east in parallel of the trail.",

Thinking back it was probably just two cats fighting, but the sudden change in how loud it was made me convinced it was a much larger animal, I started thinking that it might be a bear but then was I got closer to look I swore I saw something unrealistic. It looked to be double the size of any bear I’d ever seen, it looked like some 10 ft tall monster just glaring at me between the trees and it looked as if it was holding the cat I’d earlier heard trampling through the woods.

            "text": "One night during the summer after I graduated high school, while my family and I lived in the middle of Bum Fuck Nowhere, Texas, as my younger brother and I were chilling in our fenced backyard with our four dogs, our gold Lab suddenly emitted this uncharacteristically menacing growl, abruptly interrupting our conversation. We looked over at her to find her nose just breadths away from the fence, head low, hackles standing straight up, just *staring* across our front yard. Following her gaze, we didn't see anything at first, until a canid of some kind stepped out of the trees.\n\nMy brother wondered if it could be a wolf, and I told him it was too small—probably a coyote. After a minute or so of watching it just stand there staring at us, I decided to try to return to our conversation. Our Lab continued growling, though, so we got up from our patio to try to calm her down, petting her and telling her that it was all right. \"It's okay, Tessa, sweetie,\" I said. \"It's just a coyote.\"\n\nMy brother said, \"There's more than one.\"\n\nI looked at him, then towards the coyote, but I only saw the one. My brother has stupidly great eyesight while I've had to wear glasses since the seventh grade, so I figured he wasn't bullshitting me and actually could see something that I couldn't. As he turned and went into our nearby garage, I told him that I didn't see anymore, asked him where they were. He responded, \"In the woods, behind the first.\" No matter how hard I looked, though, I couldn't see them.\n\nA couple of minutes later, my brother returned with a gun and one of those insanely bright flashlights, turned on the latter, and shined it in the direction of the coyote that I could see.\n\nHe was right. There were several of them, some *just* outside the brush and some poking their heads out of it. For the most part they were largely unmoving, but the hair on the back of my neck stood on end when I saw one was crouched and had been slowly slinking out of the trees toward us.\n\nBy this point, Tessa was still growling, my brother had lifted and aimed the gun, and I was thoroughly freaked out. I had no idea at the time if we were actually in any danger, because I didn't know much about coyote behavior around humans, but I didn't feel safe—especially with that one fucker with the biggest balls, just gradually making its way toward us, as if we couldn't see it. (I now know that coyote attacks on humans are rare.)\n\nMy brother said, \"Cover your ears.\" I asked him if he was going to try shooting them, and he answered, \"Warning shot.\" I did as he instructed, he fired, and a split second after seeing the dirt in front of the stalking coyote's paws jump they all scattered. Tessa spooked a bit and stopped growling, and my brother and I waited, watched, and listened, scanning the area with the flashlight.\n\nMy mother and stepfather came outside, undoubtedly drawn by the gunshot, and asked us what the hell we we were doing. We explained what had happened, and my stepfather, a Texas native, told us that coyotes typically don't attack humans, but he was confused by the behavior of *that one*.\n\nWe still have no idea what that was about, and we know that we undoubtedly could've taken Ballsy Coyote alone, but it was still unnerving.\n\nOn a lighter note, my mother made it a point to gushingly praise Tessa for \"protecting\" her children, which made pupper *very* happy. (She reacted the same way that did every time she smacked the shit out of a scorpion inside the house: prancey paws, perked ears, swingy tail, big doggy smile.)",

I'm also 6'3\" and was about 240lbs at the time (I was in the gym A LOT back then). So needless to say,  I wasn't worried about anything. It's also a walk that I'd taken many times to help with some insomnia. I also carried a 4\" pocket knife (I still do).\n\nSo I'm walking in a fairly well lit neighborhood and I see a guy coming at me on the same sidewalk. It was odd because I rarely saw anyone out at that time. He was about my age, dressed normally, and looking completely non-dangerous. That being said, I don't trust people so my \"why is this guy walking at 1am\" radar went off. He was smaller than me (6' and maybe 190lbs). As we passed each other, I remember nodding at him and maybe grunting something to acknowledge that I saw him. He did the same.\n\nAfter taking another 15 steps or so, I heard the unmistakable sound of running footsteps coming at me from behind. I whirled around and saw this guy coming at me. He had closed about half the distance and he stopped when he saw me facing him. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the pocket knife and opened it and held it to my side. I was in shock as to what his intentions were or why he was running at me. He didn't look drugged out and he didn't say anything. After staring at me for about 5 seconds he turned around and started walking away again. I stood there motionless for about 30 seconds as I watched him walk away. I just couldn't understand what just happened. I finally turned back around and continued on my walk, glancing backwards every few seconds. I never saw the guy again on any of my walks. I still think about that night and wonder what made the guy decide to come at me and what he planned to do.",

But it is kind of scary in Hindsight if I wasn’t so lucky. \n\nI went to a really small college that was surrounded in a pretty decent neighborhood. Most of the forms are on the main campus, however there were another set of dorms down the street, approximately a 25 min walk. I didn’t mind so much walking as I enjoyed the outdoors and needed the exercise. My latest class would end on 9:30, so some days, I’d walk back in the night. There were street lamps and street I would walk was a busy street, even at night, so I never felt unsafe walking. One night I came across the 4 way stop intersection. I had headphones in my ear, which was not the brightest thing to do, and I always had them on full blast. I had to stop on the side walk, as I saw this one car heading fast down and my gut feeling told me that they weren’t gonna stop at the sign. As I waited for the car to zoom past, I felt a huge random gust of wind behind me. It was harsh enough to knock me over a bit. I turned to my left and saw a buck just ran past me and this one was at least 8ft tall and built. Deer weren’t uncommon around the area and often are seen around campus, however bucks were less common and we often were warned not to go near them, especially since a buck ruined a student’s car before. The car I was waiting for finally zoomed passed me (not stoping at the stop sign) and it took me a minute to realize that they were chasing the buck. I continued walking, but the thought that if I was just a step back from where I was, I definitely would have been trampled by the buck. On a funny note, it was also around Christmas time when this happened, so when I told my friends this story, I always end it with “they could of made Christmas folk songs about me..”",

            "text": "A group of raccoons chasing after one of the many stray cats in my old apartment complex.\n\n\nMy building was very close to the trash compactor.  At least once a week there would be a large pile of garbage outside of the compactor because they only emptied it once a week, and if somebody threw away a couch or other large items into the compactor itself, that caused it to fill up, fast.  Also I think a lot of that may have come from frequent clean-outs of units that either were evicted or the tenants did a \"midnight move\" and took only what they could fit in a couple of small vehicles, leaving behind everything else.  Sadly, even their pets.  And it could also have been from new tenants moving in, throwing away all of the boxes, bags, and other stuff used to pack.\n\n\nI used to like going outside and walking around at night, as well as take out my trash at night, especially after cooking supper.  One night as I was about to walk out, I saw maybe five or six raccoons rummaging through the large pile of garbage outside of the compactor.  One of the many stray cats that also lived on the complex came wandering out of some shrubs where they liked to hide, and was about to head towards the dumpster for a tasty treat when one of the raccoons noticed it and began charging towards it.  The others followed suit, and I knew that would be the end for the poor kitty.  I quickly ran inside so I wouldn't hear the carnage that surely followed.  Luckily the kitty got away (I hope) and I waited until the next morning to take out the garbage.  The bag wasn't leaking, so there was no issue there.",

I nearly shit myself because I know something was actively still eating her but I still have the flashlight on them and I start moving to me car for my gun in case it’s a coyote, which is what I thought it was since there’s no bears of wolves near Hiram. But I get close to my car and I’m still watching to make sure whatever it is doesn’t make a dash at me when the thing eating her stands up. I can clearly see it’s a naked man covered in blood and he is staring at me.

As I rode past that bust stop I can see a lady figure like sitting on the bench under the bus stop with her back facing the road so her face can't be seen. Well, I'm  just minding my own business and ride past the bus stop without thinking much",

We lived in the east end. When we all got off the subway my stupid brothers ran away from me forcing me to walk all alone at 2am. The bus going to my house from the subway no longer was running at that time so we had to walk. \n\nFirst I should mention that I am a white female. At the time I was 20 years old, 5,1 and 100 pounds. I was very small and fragile looking lol. I was also easily intimidated by people who were bigger than me especially men. I will also point out that I am in no way racist. \n\nAfter they ran away from me and I was walking to my house, that’s 2.5 miles away, I saw a group of 4 huge guys walking towards me. I wasn’t scared at all because they didn’t give out any bad vibes or energy and I’m pretty good at reading people. They all looked to be in their 20s. They were also black. As they got closer and closer to me I moved closer to the road so they could walk past me. I was just being polite and courteous, and wanted to get out of their way. As they walked passed me one of them yelled “little white girl is crossing the street to get away from the black guys huh?” Then I heard another guy yell out, “afraid of a little gang rape or something ahaha” and then they all started laughing.\n\n\nEven though I wasn’t originally scared, the one guy’s comment about the gang rape freaked me right out! My heart was racing like crazy. Cell phones weren’t a big thing back then and not many people had them (for some reason people liked pagers better back then lol. Well at least in my circle of friends/people). I was lucky enough to have one though so I called my house in hopes my mom would pick me up but there was no answer so I kept walking as fast as I could, often looking behind me to see if they were following me.

Our town was very small, and as far as I know has never had a population of unhoused people. 4 guys were sitting cross legged in the middle of the road, hunched over a manhole cover. They all had cards in their hands, it looked like they were playing poker or something. I turned around to avoid walking by them when one of them called out \"You've got to come play with us young man\" I didnt realize I had been noticed by them, so I automatically started freaking out. As I started speed walking away, I heard them start walking behind me. When I started running, only one set of steps tried to run behind me, I think maybe the other three gave up. I ran for a solid few minutes until the footsteps stopped and I was back in the woods.

Since I worked from noon to 9, night time was pretty much the only time I'd walk. \n\nYou can walk and drink alcohol outside in Japan, so I'd get myself a can or two and just choose a direction to walk. \n\nI was working in Shinjuku, which if you ever see a movie or picture of Tokyo 9 times out or 10 it's going to be Shinjuku (tall buildings, millions of people walking,  and neon lights). There is an area called Kabuki-cho which is known as Tokyo'a biggest red light districts. I'd been there many times, as it also is just like any other nightlife area of Tokyo, and had restaurants, bars, izakayas, public restrooms, etc. \n\nI made my way north from Yasukuni-dori (most movies where characters drive through Tokyo and have the lights shining on them through a window is this street) which is the start of Kabuki-cho from the regular part of Shinjuku. You know you're there as the signs for host and hostess bars start appearing, and you get drunker and louder Japanese college kids having a night out. Our tourists, since there's some \"must see\" things in the area as well. \n\nI continued north with plans to go to the closest station to take the train home, which was Shin Okubo, Tokyo's Koreatown. The lights and tall buildings eventually fade, and there's a few one or two story Korean restaurants or bars. There's a small park and some residential areas not too far from the station. \n\nI got to a well lit street along the train tracks and could see the station ahead of me, but then I was able to make out the sound of men laughing. It's normal to have people just out hanging out drinking and having a time outside, especially this time of night. Since I aas close to the station and still had a bit of drink left, o decided to see if there was some open air bar or something I'd discover. \n\nIt was easy to follow the laughter to this side street near the small park, and I saw a bunch of nicely dressed men in their 20s all gathered on this street. I've seen enough Japanese shows / movies to guess they were yakuza or chinpira (low lvl yakuza, or sometimes just wannabes) and I know just walking by them wouldn't cause any issue. So I headed to walk by them assuming they were just listening to someones story and gathered around. \n\nAs I got almost right next to them, I saw one guy, fully clothed with just his pants unzipped and slightly down, having sex with a hostess against this building. I know Japan has fucked up porn, but I didn't see any lights or crew. My mind went to rape, but only until I saw the hostess' face. If anything, she looked like she was the one in charge and getting what she wanted. \n\nI passed them without slowing down, and I think maybe two people even bothered to look my way. I made it up the street a bit more and looked back and saw the woman pulling down a different guys pants. \n\nOnly then did I finally realize I wasn't going to head to the police to report a rape. Of course I don't have the full story, but it seemed more degenerate than dangerous. \n\nI lived in Tokyo for 10 years after this, and never saw anything quite like that, and I was in Kabuki cho often after finding a few favorite places to drink and eat with friends.",

This path is not a place people would normally want to be after dark so I proceeded cautiously. I could hear someone walking towards me and eventually, I could see a man’s silhouette. Then, as he gets close to me, he turns on this super-bright LED flashlight, points it right into my eyes and starts approaching me. I grabbed my tripod with two hands and took a batting stance. The guy stops short but keeps the light in my eyes. I tell him to get the light out of my eyes, but he doesn’t. He continues approaching me. He hasn’t said a word. So I get ready to swing my tripod at this guy’s head and suddenly he realizes that maybe I might be a threat so he lowers his flashlight and goes off the path a bit to let me pass. I pass him ready to bust his melon if he takes a step towards me, but he doesn’t. As I pass him, I walk backwards and he raises the flashlight again, keeping it on me until I round a bend. I walked out of that forest looking over my shoulder the whole way. \n\nI’ve had all kinds of weird and dangerous encounters walking alone at night, but that was the most recent.

I was walking around my neighbourhood when i got to the park which is in the more quiet area of where I live. As I was coming to a bench I would usually have a smoke on (I stopped a little under a year ago) I heard some whistling, I had a look around the park around me and saw a woman in a NHS nurses uniform and jacket on her phone looking a little flustered and darting her head back behind her, it wasn’t long until I noticed that there was a man a fair bit behind her. When the lady saw me there was a look of distress in the woman’s face, this is understandable as Im a 6.3 rugby player with a rather large build and stuff like this has happened before. As soon as I realised I was scaring her I put both my hands up level with my chest as a kind of ‘sorry didn’t mean to scare you’ and stepped a side to let her past me. As she passed me I asked her if everything was alright as she look rather upset. She turn to me and told me how this guy behind followed her onto the bus from her work and had only gotten off the bus when she had and was now whistling to get her attention explaining why I heard whistling , she began break down a little. I asked her whether she would like me to walk with her back or maybe distract the guy while she ran off. She asked if I could walk with her for a wee bit until she felt safe and I agree. When walking with her I had a second look at the man, I couldn’t see a lot of him but what I could see still put me off, he was tall and thin yet well build, he was wearing a beanie of some sort and a zipper hoodie and jogging trousers, and although it was hard to see Im sure he had a small beard. Even though I couldn’t see his face all to well I could tell he was glaring at the both of us. As we went behind the bushes that led to the exit of the park he was still standing where I last saw him looking at us. When leaving the park the lady thanked me a great deal and told me that she was ok going rest of the way bye herself. With that we parted ways and I took a different path home so I didn’t have to go through the park.",

I was wrong.\n\nI managed to walk to his place safely, but the problem came into play when I was walking back home and it was 6 in the morning. Still extremely dark outside.

A nice sized bear. No idea if it was black or brown, again, it was dark out, I just know what a bear sounds like.

So, i stuffed my hands in my pockets of my long coat, grabbed everything so nothing fell out of my pockets as i quickly pull my arms above my head and spread them out as they are over my head. \n\nAs soon as I did that I watched this shadow break off from the road and just take off into the woods. As it was running I could hear the grunting of the bear as it took off running. \n\nI have another experience that also messed me up. \n\nBut I'll share the other experience if it is actually something that people wanna know about..",

It was a very twisty section of the trail with a lot of verticality, dense growth and old trees on either side of the trail. Could take quite a tumble if you wandered off the trail at the wrong spot. I brought a knife and flashlight just in case. It was very relaxing, the noise of the city muffled and nothing but the sound of my feet crunching over the gravely texture of the trail and the little animals skittering through the trees and bushes around me. That's why the sound of something less little went unnoticed for a bit. The little scratchy skittering sounds slowed and quieted, and in the silence that replaced it, I heard something brush against a tree or bush, and the sound was much longer and more drawn out than whatever little things I was hearing before. So I turned on my flashlight and pointed it in the direction of the sound, and saw nothing but a pair of eyes looking back, about waist-high and at least as far apart as a dog's eyes. That's not it, though. As I moved the flashlight around trying to make out what the eyes belonged to, I heard more quiet sounds from the brush around me. I did a slow sweep with the light and saw 5 more identical sets of eyes, all around me, as if they had been surrounding and closing in on me on purpose. That was the scariest thing. Seeing all these eyes in different directions, all looking at me, and why were they surrounding me?! I got a very strong case of \"oh shit oh shit oh shit I'm prey\". I clutched my knife with white knuckle grip and slowly walked away, backing up and twisting and turning and suddenly very aware that I can't shine the light in every direction at once. Fortunately, they didn't follow me or move at all after I flicked the light on. But damn it's scary when you realize you might actually be about to re-enter the food chain",

Long story short, we escorted her through the caravan park where she was staying to get somewhere warm where there were others around that she knew. Cops and ambos everywhere a few moments later. Turned out she was in temporary accommodation due to a DV situation, and her ex partner had found her and broken into her home. From what we overheard police saying, she had stabbed her ex and fled with her son. Ex was gone too though so managed to flee the scene. Had to give a statement etc. Scariest thing wasn't that we'd just stumbled into the scene of a stabbing, but the sheer terror that woman was experiencing. I had never seen such fear in my life.

It’s unfortunate that I did, because right as I was exiting my street I saw two guys confronting each other. At that point it just seemed like a regular argument that had potential to escalate. I just hurried past and a little while later my girlfriend woke up to sirens and blue lights on our street because someone had been stabbed to death right where I saw those guys. Im guessing I was about 30 seconds off being witness to a murder.",

            "text": "Two, one that could’ve been a genuine trick of the mind, one that just happened a week ago and still makes me uncomfortable.\nThe first, my neighborhood is a contained complex, like the only entrance is from the nearest main road, then it goes into one winding road that branches off into our various streets, and that main one in the complex has plenty of streetlights and a sidewalk. Few years back I’d walk my dogs up there at night, cause we have a simple nature trail that runs the length of the neighborhood behind the houses but it is *not* lit and sometimes unsavory things happen. So I’m walking my dog one night and near this small turn near the first street I see this figure, clearly human shaped, all white, like someone wearing a white hoodie and white pants, just standing there, my dog starts growling so I freak a little and turn around to head back. Maybe 5 seconds later I turn to see if whoever it was was there, and no, gone. \n\nSecond one, just a week ago. There’s a street that runs parallel to my neighborhood that’s separated from us by a strip of woods, and for context, there’s a few spots that have been cleared a tiny bit over the years, just small enough for a one person path through, and this street is like what you’d see in a b movie horror film, big trees on both sides, and the only light it gets is where the street lights from our Main Street bleed through the trees. Walking home from work last Friday, (I go down that street cause it saves time and things like what I’m about to say usually don’t happen), this small black car drives past me fairly slow, nothing weird, it’s got it’s lights on and there’s a handful of houses down the end of this road. I haven’t reached a pass spot yet so I keep walking. I get close to one and that same car is coming back up, but now has their headlights turned off. Remember that this street has no light other than the handful of spots where the lights from my street come through, and they know I’m a pedestrian walking by, who they now can’t see clearly. They get closer and the car starts going extremely slowly, and some instinct screamed at me to get away, so I picked up my pace just enough to practically jump to the closest pass through, and once I’m up on my sidewalk I look back and the car has pulled to a compete stop just a few feet ahead from where I’d just been standing, I move forward a bit so I’m fully under a streetlight and they turned their lights on and drove off",

About 30 minutes into my walk I was on a small trail maybe half a mile from the cabin when I spotted *something*.

            "text": "Not quite a night walk,  but a friend and I hiked over a mountain and arrived at a state park about 8 miles from our car. It had turned night in the course of our hike, and we brought camping stuff. We went to refill our canteens at a water fountain at the based of the trail, near a large parking lot.\n\nMy friend said “Don’t look right away, but there is a guy over here in the dark trying to hide his cigarette from us.”\n\nSure enough, I saw a half-concealed cherry of a cigarette held low. \n\nThere was a loop that took you down to the main road and then a gravel road that allowed access to the rear of the campground, so my friend quietly proposed we make that loop so as to not return directly to where our gear was and lead the guy back to our camp. \n\nAs we discussed this, one of two cars in the parking lot started up about 100 yards away. Instead of directly leaving, they drove towards us, and turned along the edge of the curb, scraping it because they were so busy checking us out. They then drove off leaving only the one truck. \n\nWe walked down the winding road towards the entryway of the park, and heard the truck start up distantly behind us out of sight. My friend, ex-military, guided me to creep into the woods in a small gulley and let the truck leave. We did so and we’re relieved when he passed by. \n\nThat relief ended when we heard him brake about 50 yards down the road, then turn around and slowly drive back up the road, clearly looking for us. He drove up and down the road slowly looking for us. We were being stalked by this guy. \n\nThe area was known to be an area where some trouble had happened, in particular some drug deals. We figured we had stumbled into some deal and may be thought to have witnessed something.  Fortunately, the guy couldn’t turn around very easily and kept going to different spots where the road was wider.  So we heard him coming and hid each time. \n\nWe get to the main road and there are longer stretches. The truck comes around a corner farther out, and we have to move quick. It looks clear to me but turns out  it’s 5 feet of tall grass followed by about 10 foot drop. I sail down this hill and my leg hits a rock shaped like a sharp edged table. It doesn’t hurt at all so I know I’m in trouble. I slide my middle finger up my leg and stick my finger into it, touching my exposed (but unbroken) femur. \n\nBefore it can start to hurt, I climb up to the top of the hill and lay in the tall grass. I tell my friend I’m hurt, need something to put pressure on it, and he needs to get help. I intentionally don’t look at it. He does and starts to flip out. I tell him it’s fine, but he needs to find some campers we bumped into and press them into helping us.\n\nI lay there in the tall grass for 30 minutes, hoping that the truck doesn’t come back.  It was one of the longest waits of my life. \n\nHe rolls up with these two poor guys and who take us to the hospital.\n\nA male nurse takes a look at the injury and shouts “Oh my god!”\n I hope my still unseen injury is treated more professionally by the doctor, who arrives and says quietly “oh my god”. \n\nHe then proceeds to pull sizable chunks of grass and earth out of the hole. Miraculously, no broken bone but a hell of a gouge. \n\nThe thing I remember most about that trip because it sometimes comes up is on our way to the start of our hike, we bought a sandwich and a soda and the bill was $6.66, my friend asking if the clerk couldn’t add a pack of gum or something to change the total. She couldn’t and it was bothering my friend. I told him not to be so superstitious.  In the end, I’m a bit superstitious about it too now.",

Every night around 10, my friend would pick me up and we would go to Tim Hortons for a tea, then go park at the Bluffs and chat. \n\nThis one night we decided to go to the beach and hang out there, we normally stayed to watch the sunrise but at around 3am, we each got a weird feeling, looked at eachother and decided to leave.\n\nAs we got in the car, before we turned the ignition on, we saw a car pull into the parking lot  in a spot across from us. We turned out car on, not thinking anything about it, but as soon as we did and our lights came on, that other car made a sharp turn and left the way it came.\n\nWeird, but maybe the guy made a wrong turn when he was going down to the marina(you have to turn right for the park, soft left for the marina, hard left for the beach)...so we started driving up the road to leave. \n\nThe car ahead of us did a harsh u turn, heading back to the beach.

And, there was no pack to be seen, which made me think that that wolf was probably deaf or had some deficiency, otherwise I wouldn't even be able to see it. Then, just when I started backing off, it ran away. Pretty scary for a 17 year old.",

The guy just stops and turns the other direction and starts to walk on the street towards a vehicle which happens to be his own. We started to slowly turn around still keeping an eye on him, I remember one of the guys said “wow, everyone in this town is so nice”. Literally as soon as he said that, we turn around, the dudes taking off his shirt, takes two metal baseball bats out of his boot, looks at us and just bang, hits them together and says “I’m coming for you” and just starts to sprint towards us. We ran back to the club with the security guard outside screaming to close the door, the dude with the bats starts banging on the door and everyone inside starts panicking as they watch. \nAnyway, I think they just let him off to go home.",

I took off my headphones thinking they were going to ask for directions but the cars exhaust was so loud I could barely hear what they were saying, so I just said \"sorry, I can't hear you,\" and continued on my way. They sped off down the road and I thought that was the end of it. Nope. They did a big loop and came back again. I didn't take off my headphones this time. After a few minutes of just following me (road was completely dead this late at night) they sped off again. As soon as they broke line of sight I bolted across the street, hopped a fence or two and hid until I heard their car come back around and speed off once more. After about 10 mins I popped back out onto the road (only way to get back to my street) and continued back home. Well they hadn't stopped looking for me because they showed up one last time. As soon as I heard the exhaust I pulled out my phone and dialed the police. The car caught up to me again only this time they were driving on the wrong side of the road (I guess so the driver could threaten me himself). The driver flashed a gun and asked me if I wanted to die. The call to the police hadn't gone to dispatch yet so I faked like it had and said \"Hello officer! Yes! I'm calling because I'm currently walking down _____ road near _______ heading south and there is a red vehicle, license plate reads ___--\" and they floored it out of there. When I actually did get dispatch I told them the same thing for real minus the license plate which I was never able to actually get.\n\nTL;DR car full of random people followed me around threatening to kill me for about 20 minutes until I call the cops on them.",

We used to go with family friends, lots of us kids, etc. But I had a secret hobby: from when I was 8 years old until I was 14, I used to lie awake in the tent until 2:30am (when everyone was deep asleep) then I’d inch the zip up and sneak out of the tent. \n\nFrom there, I’d head barefoot into the bush, no torch or anything, across a small lake (that was ankle deep that early in the morning from the tide going out) and over the sand dunes to the beach. Being in the national park, the beach was surrounded by nothing but dense bushland and looked out onto a bay. It took me about half an hour to walk out there. No houses, no people. I used to find deer and possums, and loved sitting against the warm sand dunes and watching the moonlight over the waves. I knew the area so well and I could be almost silent when I was barefoot - I was quiet enough to sneak up on deer. I always made sure I was back before 4:30am, when people started to be more awake again. \n\nThis one night the waves were loud, and 9 year old me came over the top of the sand dunes and to the waters edge just as a bunch of three, middle aged fishermen walked around the corner. I stopped dead, stunned, in the beam of their flashlights. They screamed. I bolted back over the dunes and into the bush, all the way back to my tent.   \n\nSo I suppose I was the scary thing. If you’ve ever walked into some 9 year old girl, leaves in her hair, dirty feet and standing alone on a desolate beach at 3:00am, sorry to have startled you.

I used to go on walks around this time pretty much every night because I loved seeing the sunset, watching the stars come out, and it was one of the few times during the day I wouldn't sweat my tits off. I live in a very rural town so I felt comfortable walking late. I usually walked until a specific intersection, then turned around to go home. It's important to say that at the corner of this intersection, there's an old man who, as far as I know, lives by himself. I've talked to him a few times while on walks and he seems really friendly. \n\nAnyways, in mid-July 2019, I was on my usual route and was nearing this intersection. In the distance, I could see a silhouette of a person walking towards me and they were passing the old man's house. Since they were still at least 1,000 feet away, it was difficult for me to pick out details about them. However, I could make out an object in their arms. Initially I thought it was a child or dog or something, but I realized it looked like a small ladder or some sort of wooden structure. They stopped on the opposite side of the road of the old man's house and appeared to be looking at the house. The person crossed the street and stood in the driveway, looking around. I assumed it was the old man doing some sort of yard work, which would explain the ladder. However, the old man's car was not in the driveway and there didn't appear to be lights on in the home or anything to indicate he was there. It looked like the person was scouting out the fucking property. I'm not sure what made them do it, but they turned around and walked back down the road where they came from. When I turned around to go home after seeing this, the old man passed me in his car and waved. So it was definitely NOT the old man.\n\nI didn't call the police because I didn't have concrete evidence that the person's intentions were malicious and I wouldn't have any details to tell them anyways since they were too far away for me to actually notice the details of their face or clothes. It was definitely suspicious as fuck though. Coincidentally the fucking day prior a body had been found on my old chem teacher's property (she lives in town) and turns out the man was a friend of one of my dad's friend. Yes, I understand it was stupid to go on a walk at night alone as a petite, small woman when a murderer was on the loose and no, I don't know any details about the story or even if the killer was caught. I was never able to find articles that were for certain linked to his case. I never went on a night walk again after that. \n\nTl;dr: went on a walk in the evening and saw a suspicious individual that looked like they were trying to scope out someone's property when they weren't home. a murder victim was found the previous day and i'm not sure if it was related to this incident or not but it's a big coincidence.",

I also remember looking at the nearby houses (maybe another 400ft away) and wondering how fast we could run to them, or if they were awake. Anyways, we got passed it, and it stayed put until we were maybe another 200ft ahead of it, and then it just kept on driving and went by us again. It didn’t come back up the road, but I remember being terrified and trying to stick close to the tree line the rest of our walk home.

A minute passes between them in dead silence waiting for the sight to show again, and when it does, it's noticeably closer. And moving towards them. They're freaking out at this point, smashing on the door and screaming trying to wake up the others inside to no avail. They hear whatever is behind them coming closer with a swishing noise and completely freeze in fear. They can see a vague reflection of the figure closing in on them in the door.

We decided to take a turn into a lovely lit church at night near a canal for some pictures. I noticed a guy walk past us, sort of eyeing up my girlfriend. I thought nothing of it at first, it happens. Out of the corner of my eye, he turns around, and begins following us a couple metres back. I warned my girlfriend that he was following us, and I wanted to make sure by taking a few strange turns. \n\nI took an immediate right down some stairs, and he followed. We walked over to the canal, and then behind a van. As we walked behind the van, I pulled her on a hard left to circle back around the van and go back the way we came to see if he’d follow. He did, he walked around the van and began following us in the same direction we came from. \n\nAt this point I grabbed her hand and made sure we walked fast enough to get back into the main crowd. \n\nScariest part about this was the amount of people around, and this man still had no care in the world about following us around, I honestly believe if I didn’t notice and we took a turn into the darker part of the canal he would have followed and god knows what he would have done.

In Las Vegas there is actually the chance of always finding drugs or money in the forms of litter as well\nAs other than those hopes\nThere is this karmic duty to help someone for the chance your good deeds are rewarded with jackpots in some unspoken assumed spiritual exchange of right and wrong. When we got closer I’d say it resembled the way a caring mother writes on\nA ziplock bag before their asthmatic child goes off on a school trip and must hand all medication over to a teacher to dole out as prescribed. Thinking either A. It could be drugs to sell or use or B. We could return a sick kids medicine for luck in the casinos we looked closer. Unfortunately it didn’t have anything about medication exactly in the writing. It said \n\n“This is Rebecca’s chest cavity, If you’re reading this she is\nProbably looking for it and would like it back” signed something I can only describe as a symbolic signature akin to the Zodiac signature. \n\nSure enough a dark bloody looking mass was inside the bag, needless to say we didn’t touch or open the bag. Walked briskly and decided to ring the police. \n\n\nWe call 911, only in Las Vegas could the operator be as inappropriate and express much more than personal interest.  \n\nConvo: hi, I’m at blank address on the corner of this intersection and there’s a bag with an organ and a creepy note. \n\nOh really? Did you touch it? How did it feel? \n\nNo ma’am from my experience watching American crime shows I thought I’d mess up the crime scene by touching it and I don’t want my prints on a dead girls heart. \n\nYeah, I guess that’s true, what did it say? \n\nIt said blank. \n\nOh that’s so wild \n\n\nYeah. Do we have to stay here cause we’re uncomfortable and don’t really want to but we still thought it was important to call. \n\n\nNo you don’t have to stay, I’ll send a patrol out there. \n\n\nWill they want to know anything else or talk to us? \n\n\nNo probably not you’re good. Have a good day! Click \n\n\n\n\nI called my parents, said we almost stepped on a heart in a bag-4 hours later after 3 months of homelessness in Vegas we boarded a flight back to our home state that night.",

The house has a park right behind it and a very large ditch with the cement/boulders. \n\nOne night, my friend and I were hanging out at the park. We noticed that there was a noise coming from this sidewalk separated by grass and another ditch. We could see rocks being thrown from up against someone's fence in an area that was filled with rocks and bushes. It was a single rock being thrown every 10 seconds or so, and every single time would bounce off of the sidewalk and land in the ditch. \n\nMy friend didn't buy what I was seeing with the rocks, so he went over to the fence in-between the bushes to pee. About 5 seconds into him peeing, he screamed and sprinted as fast as he could to my house, leaving me behind, haha.\n\nI asked him what happened and he said something touched him and said something to him, but nothing was there. That night, my mom went in the backyard, which faces the park, to take out the trash. She had to walk through our grass, past a small, toddler jungle gym and wrap around the house to get to the dumpsters. On her way back, she heard something by the jungle gym, and ran to the patio. She stared at the jungle gym and described it as something looking at her through a hole in the jungle gym, and as she was staring, a rock rolled up to her feet by the patio. She ran inside and told me about it, to which I told her about what happened at the park.\n\nWe went to the area the next morning and saw hundreds of rocks in the ditch. We also looked at the jungle gym in the backyard. The same rock was still by the patio and there were marks in the grass like someone was kneeling on the side of the jungle gym.\n\nFrom then on, only my mom and I continued to have weird, unexplainable things happen to us for years after that.",

As we walked he crept along the fence with us until I bailed on the direction I was heading and walked the opposite direction. Looked like a skinny early 20’s guy.

On all fours, it came up to my waist (and I'm a tall guy, 6'6\") with eyes that were gleaming in the edge of the light. I couldn't make out the shape of it's head, but I swear on my life that it locked eyes with me and kept walking towards me like it didn't matter.\n\nI spun on my heel and noped the fuck out as fast as my legs could take me down another street before looping around the long way and coming home from the other side of the block around 2am. To this day, I have no idea what that thing was or what it was doing in a city by Disneyland. That was the scariest moment of my life so far and I wish I could do a better job of conveying this thing I encountered.",

A few of us (4) close friends started walking home. We where all staying at a buddies house that weekend. This is in Miami so no crazy forest or deserted mountains ranges. We where walking down the street by this time it’s 11 or so. Not a lot of people around and barely any cars driving. A black Cadillac Escalade drives passed us slowly but keeps going and makes a right a few blocks ahead. As we reach that street the truck is parked on the side of the road still running with headlights on. As we cross in front of it and reach the sidewalk it starts creeping forward. By this time we start discussing among ourselves on what to do. We had no chance, as soon as the car turns behind us all 4 doors open up and 5 older guys jump out. We didn’t wait to see what they wanted and took off running. At first we where all together but then the truck cut us off and we all split. I ran down the street and jumped the fence of a house and ran into their backyard, jump the fence into the adjacent backyard and made it to the other street. At this point the goal is to make it to my buddies house which is about 4 blocks away. As I’m like speed walking I look back and I see 2 of the guys, they spot me and I take off running again. I pull the same move again and this time I lay inside the bed of a someone’s pickup truck. A few minutes later I can hear people walking by the truck pretty fast, they where trying to find us.  I never felt fear like that in my life. At any moment they can peek over into the bed of that truck and they got me dead to rights. They keep walking and I just laid there. After a bit I hear the truck drive up and the street until eventually it goes quiet again. I never moved a muscle again. Not much later I can see red and blue lights bouncing off the trees and house. I sit up and it a cop driving slowly down the street and 2 or 3 cops walking alongside him. They where sweeping the area looking for us. This was back in 2001 so no cellphones. Turns out one of our buddies made it to a random house as the owner had just pulled in. He let my buddy in and while my friend told him what happened his wife was on the phone with the cops. Turns out I was the last one missing as all my other 3 friends where found before me. We all did the same thing. Jumped through house just trying to get away. They never found the guys, but they did find the truck. It was stolen brand new from a Cadillac dealer a town away. I believe they where out kidnap someone and we where the perfect opportunity for them. Thank god we where young and quick to not be caught. Till this day my buddies and I speak of it. Now it’s more of a small action moving that we where involved in. But still, I think of the people that aren’t so lucky.",

I pretty much only did it on the weekends though because of school and stuff. I remember it was a Friday night at like 11:00. There was a park that I would go to and sit down at sometimes. This night I chose to do that. It was October so decently cold out and the park had a dense forest behind it, but luckily it was a decently sized park. \n\nSo as I was sitting on the bench I had my headphones on (only one tho) and I was texting my girlfriend. When I heard this sound from behind me. It was so quite that if the sound in my headphones was up even one more bar I probably wouldn’t have heard it. It didn’t even look behind me because at first I didn’t know where it had came from until later. I just looked up and scanned the surroundings before getting occupied texting again. After like 6 mins I remembered the sounds I had heard and just so happened to look behind me. In the forest I could barley see anything but what I could see was the outline of a person. A person just standing there… it was so dark I couldn’t tell you the race, age, even gender of this person but there was somebody there. And they were standing in an exaggerated pose. Like you know the “T pose” rendering video game characters will have? Imagine that but their arms weren’t all the way out just outward a little, and they were standing with their legs spread apart some. I just sat their dumbfounded staring at this person who was completely still, not making 1 noise or moving at all. I stood up and began the walk back in the direction of my house. As I was like 40 feet from where I was sitting, I looked back and the SAME PERSON was now standing where I was just sitting in that same exaggerated pose. It was like someone picked him up and put him back down the exact same position. I didn’t even hear him move but I still had a headphone over one ear so that prolly why. It was a man who was just staring dead at me whit a blank face, and needless to say I hightailed it out of there. Never went on night walks again after that…",

We misjudged the time it would take us to walk around and it was well past dark as we passed by the wooded hill. As we walked and talked, we both felt unease creep in. In one moment, we both heard behind us, the snap of a branch being stepped on by a heavy weight. We both spun around to find — nothing. But we could head breathing. I called out, “Who’s there?!” Nothing. I stood there waiting, my wife behind me holding my forearm.  Moments passed and we heard running of two feet up and along the hill, moving beyond our position. I chased beside, down the path we were walking on, but the footsteps increased pace and outpaced me. I stopped to listen so I could locate the thing tracking us. I heard beaches clear up ahead on the path and looked up to see in shadow, a body of a human figure. Tall and misshapen, hard to make out as a light from a power generation facility off in the distance provided just enough to confirm our anxiety. I yelled with some fear now, for this thing to stay there and to confront me. I ran towards it, both angry and fearful of what I was going to encounter and it remained standing, motionless. Now, just 25 feet from it I was running full pace and it simply stepped to the side and disappeared into the bush. I stopped. And I heard nothing. I tried to calm my breathing so I could hear better. My wife cam running up behind and all I could hear were her footfalls. I shushed her and point in the direction the thing had been. Nothing. It just vanished. \n\nWe turned and ran down the path as quietly as possible, trying to also listen for the thing and then turned right towards the street side of the pond. Another 100 yards to street lights. We again heard the breath and footfalls of something in the woods. We were in a full sprint now, racing for the street lights. \n\nThe footfalls stopped as we reached the edge of light coming from this street lights, but we ran until we touched the light pole. Trying to calm our breathing so we could listen, we heard nothing. It felt as if we waited forever to listen, but hearing nothing else we turned for home with the hairs on the back of our neck, up and glances backwards the whole time. \n\nWe had many walks around the pond in the years after, but never at dusk.",

I had gone for a walk on my own as I couldn’t sleep. I was full of awe at my new surroundings, and wondered further than I had realised. I was walking back to camp when I saw a wolf walk onto the path in front of me.It stopped and just looked straight at me. \nI stopped in my tracks, I had never seen a wolf outside of zoo. I tired to act cool but I was anything but. My heart was pumping like crazy.  When the wolf let out a howl, I felt my heart miss a beat.  \nAs the wolf was directly in line with my direction of travel, I set off to the right trying to get to the camp on a longer but hopefully wolf-free route. \nI was walking at a quick pace. At first it appeared that I’d left the wolf behind, but before long I noticed that it was on my new trial, following me. First a couple of hundred meters behind but each time a would glance back it was getting closer.  \nI was confused, I didn’t think this was normal behaviour, but what did I know? I knew not to run. I got out a Swiss Army knife from my pocket. I’m not sure that it was any good for much more than opening cans of tinned food, but it gave me some comfort.\nThe camp was only a mile away but it felt like it was a very far and I felt very alone. Each time I turned round to look, the wolf had got closer. I was starting to feel panicky. I had got to the point of not wanting to look back, but I forced myself to do so, tin opener in hand ready for battle. \nAnd he’d gone. Until I saw the camp I didn’t let the little penknife out of my hand.",

I sometimes shake my head from side to side to exercise it. \n\nSo i was casually walking back and decided to exercise my head as i was walking past some stairs going up into the park. As my exercised my neck from side to side, i saw a face then I hear him say 'what are you looking at'. Didn't reply and noped outta there!\n\nSecond thing that happened was when i went drinking with a date. I got on the bus after the date completely drunk and fell asleep. I only woke up at the last stop. I got out of the bus and saw a woman lying on her back, sprawling and motionless on the ground. I saw some random people around so i just grabbed her, propped her up and found a nearby taxi stand. She was semi awake when i put her in the taxi but she gave me a cold stare. I took a look at the taxi driver's badge just in case anything made the news later.

He worked the late shift at our local airport as an air traffic controller--about 10 minute drive from his house//30 min walk (I actually live in same neighborhood now). His car was in the shop so he had been walking home for the week--middle of the night (2 AM or 3 AM).\n\nThe walk is mainly back roads, then link up to a bike path for the last few miles. Bike path is old part of a canal system right next to a river.\n\nHe's on the walk one of these nights, on the bike path, 2 or 3 AM. Starts to hear sort of a clunking noise behind him far off. Its rythmic though. Same clunk every second. Clunk.....clunk.....clunk....\n\nNow this guy was Viet Nam vet. Old school, from small hard scrabbled Adirondack's town originally. grizzled, tough MFer. Drank 2 quarts of beer every day until his death (RIP great guy). Not scared of anything.\n\nBut at 2AM, 3 miles from home, on the pitch black bike path w this unexplained rhythmic clunking noise coming up from behind and getting closer, he is tweaked.\n\nSo he gets off the path and ducks down in the wooded gully just off the side of the path and waits.\n\nClunk....clunk....clunk.....\n\nCloser and closer it gets but he can't see anything.\n\nFinally the noise is upon him. He peers out and he sees it's one of his neighbors dressed in all black, on a bike, slowly riding. The rhythmic clunking noise was an empty gasoline can he had in his hand, that was hitting the wheel every rotation.\n\nSeeing this he exhales..\"phew its just Ronnie from down the road,\" he thinks.\n\nSo, he says he was about to step out and call after him so he could walk the rest with the way and chat...but something stopped him from doing so...some thought just siezed him that he should keep to himself. So he stayed hidden till this guy was long gone. Then did the rest of the walk home.\n\nHe was trying to figure out why this guy would be out at that hour biking in all black w a gas can.....said he finally just figured he was on an overnight at the volunteer fire place or something.\n\nNext day when he gets up, 6pm local news, top story, night before... there was a horrible fire at a suburban home one town over, whole family of 5 died.\n\nHe says he still didnt really put 2 and 2 together...it didnt, in fact, dawn on him until weeks later when the neighborhood was full of cops and ambulances....\n\nTurns out, this neighbor/volunteer fireman was a local arsonist. Had been under investigation for a few fires, they finally were about to pinch him...so he had shot his wife and then killed himself murder/suicide.\n\nMy FIL sat in complete stunned silence...he realized he had seen this cat on his way back from setting the fire that had killed that family of 5.",

By 10pm I was approaching the creek to cross and right there was a group of young guys having a fire. I recognized one if them from high school! I popped put of the other side of the woods saying hey 'his name' and galloped across the creek. \nThey seemed pretty bewildered.

So the old man pulls out a shotgun that nobody knew he had and fires a “warning” shout into the air, and then started waving it around saying that he would “protect his family”. The police were called and thankfully nobody actually got shot. But then refused to let the police search his house without a warrant l. So they woke a judge up in the middle of the night, who gave the a warrant but didn't have him arrested, and said that they couldn't take away any of his guns until he's gone to court over the incident.

We couldn’t see exactly where it was coming from, but at least knew that it was up another street somewhere. Despite that, we could tell that the person doing it wasn’t far away. My friends and I were all startled to be sure, but only my friend who’s house we were staying at and I seemed genuinely freaked out by it. Regardless, we agreed to start heading back to my friends. We tried to change the subject while talking to get our minds off what we had heard, but I remember when mentioning it again a few minutes later one of my friends quickly shut me down, saying he didn’t wanna talk about it.

So i pack my backpack camping gear and we decide to camp somewhere simple. Drive the 40 almost to gallup but get off an hour before to just set up camp and eat some food before we smoked a blunt i rolled. I was 20, 4 years of smoking, my friend was 18  smoking since he was 14. So we aren't noobs at smoking. A blunt was an nightly occurrence. \n\nSo just sitting there with the fire going and looking at the sunset that was fleeting, we noticed a green hew of the sky out of no where. I look at my friend and his eyes were fixed on the horizon where the sun was setting. A meteror that was falling from the sky but was green enough to change the sky color was falling on the same point the sun had just set. And then it hits the horizon as a red green blue mixture of colors disperse from what looked like an impact point. So were both looked at each other and thought holy shit. Was that like an alien space craft crash landing? Apparently it was just a meteror i found out a few weeks later but i never saw one with those colors. \n\nAnyways that was the regular part of the story. After that happened i was a little paranoid. It was like 8 at night and i make an excuse to leave and say hey, if we camp lets really camp, like in the forest and stuff. Knowing the only forest was nearby was like 2 hours toward santa fe, north of Albuquerque i believe. So i break everything down, poor water on the fire and stomp it with dirt and head up to santa fe. \n\nSo we were looking for a good camping spot driving out to santa fe. Me being impatient i decide to set up camp off a ranchers road because i remember ranchers lands are okay for hunting and camping. Or it's like forest service land/government land that is shared with ranchers even though it is their land to raise cattle. We make a small fire and make hot dogs off my tailgate of my truck around 11pm. My friend then pulls out some shrooms we bought that day that I was trying to save until the next day. \n\nHe just starts eating them. So i'm like well we have 4 grams. I'll eat half and he'll eat half. Even though i was 6 ft 180 pounds, he was like 5'6 150. So we start tripping a little. He is talking about that crazy light thing that just happened and i was thinking we still haven't made it to any tree lines. It was all rolling hills and bushes. \n\nSo i say\" hey lets go find some fucking trees. \" my friend was chill, he said no this place is great. But it was my truck and i wanted some trees to see. Lol i was a little high off the shrooms but i was able to drive fine. Just felt rather stoned. Next thing i know we made it to some trees almost 30 minutes outside of santa fe. I take my dodge dakota 2 wheel drive up a rocky trail only to find a ranger gate that said no trespassing. I turned my truck off and went to see if i could open the gate and continue because the trees just started getting forest like. I wanted more trees. Lol. \n\nNope the gate was locked. And when i went back to my truck it didn't start back up. My truck is old. 1999 2000 and the battery died on me. So i'm like well this is where we camp. And we get sleeping bags out and start sleeping in the bed of my truck. By this time i'm pretty high on shrooms. I see the trees dancing in the wind and my friend is like yooo, this is where we belong. And i was like \"okay your high as fuck\". Which he was. \n\n10 mins pass or more. Idk really. And a bright light behind us starts shining like led lights or something super light. I think it's the cops or forest rangers and try to play it cool like i wasn't high as fuck. \n\nA person steps out and i kid you not it is the person who sold us shrooms back in Albuquerque a few days prior. \n\nFor me it seemed like a crazy miricale and somehow we were all supposed to meet that night at that time. He helped me put my truck in neutral and gentle back my truck down off the trail, which was like 100 feet up back down to the base of the highway. Then he and his family unlock this gate that says forest service land that i tried to get pass and they locked it up behind them and continued on a road that was for forest service only. \n\nVery confused i tried to sleep out a night of shrooms in the cold by a highway with cars passing by every 5 mins. \n\nThe next day i replaced the spark plugs and charged the battery but wasn't able to leave until i had my truck jump started by my friends mom who drove out to help us. \n\nDrove back to Albuquerque and went to classes for college the following week looking to see the kid who sold me and my friend shrooms. He never answered his phone calls, his texts and i never saw the guy in class again. Typical behavior for a drug dealer i guess but my friend and i played Nintendo 64 with this guy for the last year before the camping trip. Still bothers me.",

He was doing that, peeking at me while standing completely still and with the most insane, creepiest grin on his face… nothing behind his eyes, just this fixed smile on his face. \nI was like 3 meters away from him, and though I paused for a second I decided to keep walking and not change my behavior so as to not « set him off » or something.

            "text": "Perfect timing for this thread and I don't know if this counts but,\n\n I was at an open air rave in a forest outside of the city last night with friends, I had a friend visiting me abroad from our home city so we decided we will leave the rave when the sky shows first signs of any daylight. So the sky turns a bit blue so we decide to leave the others behind, and walk 9 kilometers next to the river to the nearest train station to return home.\n\nAs we were walking through nature, we reached the industrial zone (cement and concrete factory) and we were passing through it, with a few loners passing by also trying to get home. On our way we run into a \"couple\" that looked like they were tucked together kissing, but then the guy turned around and noticed us so they continued to walk instead.\n\nWhile we were passing them, the guy asks the two of us if we have a cigarette, to which I replied no (I only had rolling tobacco with me and I couldn't be arsed to stand there while he rolls himself a cigarette), he then asks if we had a condom (this was an orange flag to me) so I just shrugged it off at first and said no. However, the girl calls out for me in a very mellow voice and says that she wants to go home. \n\nI turn to ask her again to repeat it just in case I heard it wrong, and she says she wants to go home, I ask her does she want to go home with the guy, she says no and makes hand gestures as if she wants to push the guy away. So I turn to the guy and tell him \"I'm sorry mate, you have to leave, she wants to go home\". She then says he is nice but that she wants to go home, she looked really confused. I told her he may not be nice, if she doesn't know him, because he just asked us if we had a condom. She looked shocked and my friend pushed the guy away because he was walking with us so he goes away.\n\nHe was constantly saying it's all good and he will leave but kept walking next to my friend, at one point my friend gets agitated and pushes him away and tells him to leave. He goes aside and stays behind. So we try to get this confused girl to tell us how she wants to go home, if she wants an Uber. We stop at the end where the road begins and try to call an Uber, she asks for our address to put it in there as our first stop and hers as second, but we were against it  because we didn't have money to pay for that big trip, we planned to walk anyways.\n\nShe was so out of her mind on mdma that she couldn't order an Uber and understand simple question of explaining how she planned this trip.\n\nAnyways, she reassures us that it's okay even if she goes alone, orders an Uber which turns out to be a Turkish driver and she is Turkish too, so she speaks to him in Turkish like he was her friend. After the call she tells us it's okay and that we can now leave her alone, so we say goodbye and walk a bit further away out of her sight, by we stop and wait until we see her sit in the car. 10 minutes later she sits in the Uber and leaves (100% her Uber because it had also a taxi sign on top, matched the description of the Uber app and no other cars but Ubers ride in this street at this hour. The car passes us, we see her sitting in the back and we leave.\n\nI like to think that we saved someone from being raped this early morning.",

My house was about a 7 minute walk from the train station and the route home was fairly well lit for the first few minutes of the walk. I'd done this route hundreds of times and was pretty comfortable with the walk home. \n\nI had my headphones in listening to a podcast and not really paying attention to my surroundings. I lived in a fairly safe neighbourhood, so I was never afraid of getting jumped or robbed. \n\nI made my way across the street from the station, along with a bunch of other people returning home late. The crowd got thinner and thinner as people started to branch off into their respective streets as the walk progressed. \n\nI recall walking about 50 metres behind a very tall man at a reasonably quick pace. We both mainted the same level of pace from the station about 6 mins into the walk. \n\nThat was until, I made the final left turn onto my very long stretch street....which is where things got really weird. As I made the turn...the man who was just a bit ahead of me had just disappeared, I didn't think much of it until I walked a bit deeper into the street and noticed the same man behind a wide tree...staring at me and moving behind the tree as I got closer and closer.\n\nMy heart sank, my adrenaline started pumping and I had absolutely no idea what was about to happen. For some reason, I did not stop and turn around. I kept moving on my path down the street... whilst maintaining eye contact with this creepy man behind the tree....he continued to take cover and kept moving around the tree to hide himself. \n\nAs I walked a few metres away from the tree...I jogged across the road onto the opposite sidewalk and kept checking my back. The man did not appear again and I did not bother sticking around. I got to the front door of my house and ran inside and locked the door.\n\nI have no idea till this day why he hid or what the man's intentions were. A part of me believes he was probably just as scared that he was being followed for a solid 6 or so minutes and he freaked out. Another part of me believes he had other plans but bailed cause I was on high alert and didn't break eye contact with him. \n\nEither ways, I'll never know and its still pretty scary and creepy till this day. My only tip for anyone walking late at night. Make sure you take a path home that is well lit, ideally has high traffic, and someone knows your whereabouts.\n\nStay safe night walkers!",

But we were both well aware of each other's presence.\n\nAs we started to get closer, they started drifting to my side, through the middle of the path and all the way to my side.

I said \"Why are you approaching me?\", and she's like \"I'm not?\". She was either oblivious to the situation or maybe she did plan to engage me for something, idk.

We had a whole bunch of family members sleeping in every possible space, including outside in the grass. I had recently gone through a terrible breakup that ended with him taking his own life and I was drinking quite heavily. I was also chain smoking cigs like it was my job. \n\nMy family didn’t/doesn’t know I smoke except for my sister. Fast forward a few days of staying with everyone and slowly losing my fucking mind and having a straight up ‘nic fit,’ as my sister called it. I was bawling, sobbing, hyperventilating, I just wanted to go home. I just wanted booze. I NEEDED A SMOKE! My sister started getting annoyed (we roomed together) so she decided we should go for a walk to see if I’ll calm the fuck down. I was in a bad bad way. \n\nMy grandma lives in the middle of noooowhere. Very few neighbors, dirt roads, etc. One of her neighbors was notorious for being a piece of shit and loud, drunk, neglects his kids, etc. and he’s terrifying. We always worried about my grandma being near him because we heard horror stories of all kinds of what I assume to be domestic abuse. Lots of noise, breaking stuff, and he was just a violent belligerent douchebag. \n\nWell, about 11:30 we start walking (and smoking) and I start to calm down but then we hear yelling. Then fighting. Then screaming. I can’t remember for sure but I think we heard/saw him do something to his wife like smashed her into the truck or something. We paused for a half sec then continued on but he saw us. So obviously we are way freaked but we just walked past the house and thought nothing of it. Ya know like mindin our own business happy to be out of the house. \n\nThis motherfucker starts up his truck and literally starts FOLLOWING US. My sister and I kinda half ran, half stumbled to the intersecting road and took a right. So did this motherfucker. He was looking for us. Big ass truck with bright ass headlights. We dived into some nearby bushes/trees/garbage, it was a jungle looking area right off the road which I can only imagine how many bugs were in there but our lives were more important at the moment. \n\nThis dude creeped his creepy ass truck up the road almost to where we were and stops. Just stops, lights on, parks. I could not breathe. He stayed parked there for about 10 minutes just walking the fuck around with his flashlight. We stayed in the bushes that whole time and didn’t dare move until he left and kept driving (he didn’t go straight back home). Once we realized he was gone we booked it back to my grandmas house running in and seeing all of our family members in the kitchen just staring at us because I was bawling, again, and my sister was trying to explain what just happened. My uncle was in the secret service and him and his son were the ones sleeping outside, and if I didn’t trust his skills from his occupation, I woulda made them come in. I was fucking terrified. \n\nNothing more happened after that and the house was torn down pretty quickly after that I think. Thank god. I felt bad for those kids. Idk what his plan was gonna be if he found us but fuck that ish. Every time I visit my grandma I get chills walking where it was.",

The staff cabin (for those not staying with the campers) was located a good 15-20 minute walk away from the camper’s buildings, and the trail we’d take went through a small gully and up a pretty steep hill before it leveled out. No lights, and mostly no pavement.\n\nI was working late getting things ready for the going away party the next day, and I was alone because the flu had put half the counselors on their ass that day. Once I was done I started to walk back as twilight faded into blackness.\n\nI had gotten up the hill to the cabin about halfway before I got the feeling I wasn’t alone. My feet had been making a lot of noise on the rocky trail so it took a second to register what sounded like something moving slowly in the brush behind me. I swung my cheap headlamp around frantically trying to figure out what was there.\n\nAbout 40ft down the path behind me in the bushes to the right of the trail were a pair of glowing, wide set green eyes. They were about 2ft off the ground, not moving. My lamp was too dim to detect anything else through the brush so I had no clue what type of creature it was. After a second the eyes lowered a foot, still fixed on me. I was fucking terrified. I froze for a second or two before letting out a guttural bark in an effort to scare it off. It didn’t move. I started to back away slowly, repeating the bark. I went up the trail like that, headlamp fixed on the eyes. The eyes didn’t move. As soon as I reached the flat part I sprinted for the nearest building, screaming my ass off. I made it inside to a lot of freaked out coworkers who looked out the window, but didn’t see anything.\n\nTo this day I have no clue what it was, but I know was big and it scared me real good.",

At the beginning of the path just at the edge of the forest there was a woman standing smoking a cigarette. I didnt think much of it and walked past her. I was wearing noise-cancelling headphones so i couldn't hear anything around me unless it was pretty loud, but i got this really bad gut feeling so i looked over my shoulder and saw her walking after me. When you get to the beach there is a public restroom, since i felt uneasy about this woman i went in there and waited for a few minutes until she would've passed if she was in fact not following me. I grabbed the lighter in my pocket just so i could maybe flick it in her face to scare her if she was standing outside waiting to jump me or something (not that i would like, set fire to her obviously but it was the best and only thing i could think of for self defence and maybe buy myself some time to get a headstart on a sprint) i walked out and i didnt see her right away. I turned left to walk towards a pier and looked back a little and i saw her, just as she noticed me too, and she started moving the same direction as me immediatley when she saw which way i was going, as if to make it seem like she had been moving in that direction the whole time if that makes sense. Shes pretty close behind me so i stop to light a cigarette in hopes that shes going to pass by me and i can turn and walk the other way. She kinda slows down so when i start walking again shes practically walking right beside me, so i sit down on the first bench i pass by. I can immedialtley see the look of \"what do i do now\" on her face as shes doesnt seem to want to go past me. She walks a few metres further down the path and stops in the area between two of the lights that light up the path, where its pretty dark, and she has lit another cigarette at one point because she was always holding a lit cigarette. I cant decide if the best thing to do is go up to her and just straight up ask what she's doing (for all i know she could ve in trouble and is scared to ask me for help, im bigger than her, and i'm a trans guy, but in the dark i could pass as a cis male as long as i dont speak because im not on hormone treatment yet), or walk the other way to see if i might be overthinking and she isnt following me at all, and if she still followed me as i walked back the other way i would know for sure. Two guys walked past and i picked up the courage to tell them what was going on and ask them to walk with them to the pier so i could get past the lady because i doubt she would follow all three of us, and sure enough, she didnt. When we walked past her she seemed like she was dissappointed and frustrated, but not in a scared way per say. When we reached the pier i thanked the guys for letting me walk with them and i called up my dad to have someone on the line just in case, it seemed like a bad idea to call when she was around in case she thought i was calling the police or something so i tried my best to think on my feet.

The visibility was so bad, you could barely make out anything 10ft in front of you. I donned a Jason Mask that I coated in a light-reactive \"blood spatter\" design, wearing a beater and skull-covered board shorts. The mask would glow even without a light source for a good 5 mins or so, and I of course pre-lit it before I left with my strongest UV flashlight.\n\nI turned a corner heading towards the Wawa down the street from me, and came face to face with two couples walking home from the local bar/restaurant. This one girl screamed SO LOUD, dropped to her knees instantly, and grabbed the dude she was next to so hard he jumped. She was the first one who noticed me. She was SCREAMING \"please don't kill us! I'll give you anything...\" and crying her eyes out.\n\nHer friends started laughing, super hard. The one guy she was ripping the arm off of said, \"hey, nice mask but you're a little early on the treats.\" Then he looked down and told the girl to \"stop making a scene.\" I felt so bad, apologized profusely to them all, and the girl was visibly shaking. She wouldn't let anyone touch her, and she just ran down the street away from us... INTO THE FOG where she disappeared from sight, with her guy chasing after her.\n\nThe other couple just said, \"nice costume\" and left. I still feel bad about that because I wasn't even trying to scare anyone. I just wanted some sammiches and deli (damn you wawa for getting rid of that) from the store.",

Everything was normal, but after a while, one by one, we started to hear screams coming from somewhere in the forest. At first, we thought it might have been a mating call or some other sound that we may have confused it for, however, as the screams grew louder we realized that it was definitely the screams of a human woman. Although unintelligible, you could hear the fear in her voice. We decided to head back up the trail to the cottage to see if we could see anybody from up there as it’s a lot higher up. About 1/3 of the way to the cottage, without warning, a woman covered in dirt and blood comes barreling out of the forestry area to our left - luckily (and thanks to my cousins quick reaction time), the breaks were slammed on and the car stopped inches from the woman’s body. Ironically, the three of us in the car were like a deer in the headlights until we could see the look of relief on her face once she processed what had just happened.\n\nTurns out she was on some sort of retreat and got separated from her group and was wandering the forest for hours looking for any one who could help. She followed the river downstream until we (literally almost) ran into her. We drove her back to where the retreat started, which was actually pretty close by, and she was beyond thankful.\n\nI was so glad that we managed to help her - she looked like she had been to hell and back.\n\nEDIT: phrasing",

I was almost at my friends house walking alongside the park when some dude in a beige Toyota pulls up. He slowly matched my waking pace with his car and rolled down the window. It was some Hispanic man maybe in his mid 40’s & he was trying to convince me to get in his car. When I really started bolting it was when he reached over and opened the passenger side door. I never ran to my friends house so fast in my life lol. We decided to call the cops & they surprisingly came pretty quickly. The got the suspect & put him in a patrol car, and then they had me drive by in a police vehicle with tinted windows to confirm it was the dude. I really couldn’t make out whether it was him or not but the police took the suspect anyway because he had warrants. They literally had helicopters looking for the car until they found it.

I guess he noticed us noticing him, and he moved even faster towards us, I’ve never seen someone move like that. The creepiest part was he kept his face down, we could only see his hair and body. All I said was “hell no”, and I ran towards the bike racks. My friend followed and once we got to the bike racks we looked back and couldn’t see him anymore. We laughed it off nervously, but I still wonder what would have a happened had we stayed out or even confronted the guy. Super creepy.",

We were highschool aged, parents didn’t know we were dating so we did this to avoid anyone seeing him drop me off. The walk would have been around 10pm and under 2 minutes if I was taking my time. That night, at the beginning of the street, there was a green sedan parked right under a broken street light. He was parked on the opposite side of the street to where I was walking. Right as he saw me, he got out of his car, popped his trunk and said, “excuse me can you help me find 101 *my street name*?” The trunk had a dim light so I could see there were some pizza boxes stacked in the trunk. My parents lived in a very small culdesac with 8 houses and the highest number the houses went up to was 24. So as I’m still walking I said “the houses don’t go up that high on this street but maybe check the next street over.” After I said that, he walked back towards and stood next to the open trunk, pulled a piece of paper up to his face, pulled his glasses closer to his eyes and squinted and said, “actually I might have written the address wrong, can you help me double check it?” For whatever reason that night, the hairs on my neck stood up when he did that. This whole exchange happened in a matter of a minute. My flight or flight intuition kicked in. Something deep in my gut told me do not walk up to look at that piece of paper. I remember power walking turned to running as I said back to him “no but check the next street over.” I could hear him slam his door and peel away as I ran as fast as I could. Ran up to my parents’ doorsteps and pressed the doorbell a million times. My sisters opened the door screaming for me to stop pressing the door bell. I was nearly in tears and out of breath trying to tell them that I think I just almost got kidnapped. My then boyfriend turned husband knows how much this still affects me until this day.

I took a detour and let one of the campus police know that some drunk guy was causing a disturbance by an intersection; he thanked me and took off.\n\n\n\nAnother time I saw a male student in the midst of a psychotic episode. Like full blown schizophrenic hallucinations; he looked like he was expecting the sky to fall on him. He had a fob to get into my dorm, so he must have lived in our community at least. The kid was black, and honestly I wasn't comfortable calling 911 because I didn't think the cops on this campus would help him more than hurt him.\n\n\n\nOne year after the snow started melting I saw multiple dead squirrels in the banks next to walkways. Not exactly scary, but it was sad to see how many of them had been sliced in half during hibernation as the plows cleared walkways and green patches.\n\n\n\nThe scariest was when my coach decided to follow me home to my dorm one night.

Weird that they closed the distance so quick, but not anything absurd, so I carried on and looked back a few seconds later thinking I was about to be passed, only to find that the the light was totally gone.

The whole thing just seemed really fucking unusual (I was trudging around those woods mutliple times a day every day for years and this was the only time it happened) so I swivelled my head torch around the side of my head so I could keep an eye on them without letting them know I was watching. \n\nI got to the top of a hill and took a hard left and watched this stupid motherfucker just make a bee line straight at me - he went wholly off path to come direct at me, trudging through thick brush, swamp, streams, the works.

            "text": "This is for me because it happened like 3 weeks ago.\n\nI enjoy going for hikes at night because you get to see more wildlife. I went out to a local river that has a trail that closely follows alongside it like I do frequently and was lucky enough to see lots of frogs and and a few snakes that night. I made it about half a mile down the main trail when I heard a relatively loud noise ahead of me and as I shown my flashlight in the direction I just caught a glimpse of a large hairy leg tucking behind a rather large tree about 60-70 feet ahead of me. Now this was far enough away that it didn’t frighten me but close enough with my flashlight that I could distinctly make out long brown and black fur that seemed to be matted. Mind you this was dark and it happened in a split second but that’s what my mind registered. It was odd because I live in North Carolina and the only thing that would have a fur profile such as that which was consistent with the size of the leg would be a black bear. Though black bears are rarely if ever brown that’s the explanation my mind went with. So I casually turn around on the narrow trail deciding it was best not to tempt a bear at night. I’d walked probably 200 yards roughly when I heard a similar noise as before again in front of me so I shine my light in the direction and there’s another large tree this time with what appears to be a very large and long hairy arm reaching around the tree as if something were gripping it to peer from around the other side. I didn’t notice anything other than this arm maybe 30 feet ahead of me and within a few seconds of shining my light on it the arm is pulled out of sight slowly behind the tree. Mind you this is probably 7 feet up the tree, I’m 5’10, and it was well above my eye level. So at this point I kind of panic and begin to sprint down the trail trying my best to keep my flashing on the same side where I saw this. I make it a few hundred yards and realize I shouldn’t be running IF it is a bear but at this point I’m also considering it’s someone in a costume messing with me. So I stop to catch my breath and kneel down on the trail for a moment I draw my firearm from its holster (I always carry on night hikes) and turn the light on my gun on as well using it to look one way down the trail and the flashlight to look the other. I sit for a few moments heart pounding breathing heavy and trying my best to rationalize what just happened. I reaffirm my previous conclusion that it’s either a bear that was climbing the tree or a person messing with me and that my best course of action is to slowly walk forward with both lights on staying vigilant and reaching my vehicle. So I proceed. Again I make it a little ways down the trail and I hear a large tree branch snap as if something had stepped on it in the underbrush. I shine my light and sure enough there appears to be a portion of arm sticking out behind a large tree ahead of me this time more like an elbow shape sort or like this > and after a few brief seconds it retreats the arm behind the tree approx. the same height as before. My heart starts pounding even harder and I pick up the pace as I’m getting closer to my car. I nervously cross the two rather wide creeks along the trail as I’m nearing the entrance of the trail head. Suddenly I hear a louder noise like the first time and shine my light ahead of me and off near another large tree I again see a portion of arm like before this time sticking out a bit further almost revealing a shoulder if I had to guess but can’t be sure. This time almost immediately as I shine my light on that area it disappeared behind the tree. I’m absolutely terrified and drenched in sweat at this point so I decide to put away my flashlight and fix my firearm and it’s light on the location gripping it with both hands prepared to shoot and slowly inch my way along the path drawn up while I reach my vehicle. At this point I’m literally 100-150 yards from my vehicle and as I climb the small hill leading to my vehicle I consider popping off a few rounds to see if I can scare whatever this thing is out of hiding but my first thought after that was “well what if it is a person messing with me?”. So I choose not to. I at this point have nearly made a full 360° circle around the tree and haven’t seen a single sign of anything when I reach my vehicle. I hop in and take off down the road my mind racing trying to comprehend what had happened. \n\nA few notes I’ve made regarding this encounter: \n\nI don’t believe it was supernatural but I can’t explain it.\nI never heard it moving through the trees as it appeared in front of me all 4 times. \nI never got a full view of it and only heard it when it was behind cover (as if it was intentionally making its presence known).\nAnd finally, I’ve spent my whole life in the woods from Florida to North Carolina and have encountered pretty much most animals that can be found in the areas and I’m not convinced it was any of them.",

One of these “evil serial killers in the night” that everyone on this thread keeps running into.\n\nI was jogging at night which I do in fall and winter. I do this because I work all day, then try to spend some time with my daughters, and by the time I get them to bed it it dark outside.  Nefarious right?\n\nSo I am jogging my normal route and it is a very foggy and dark night.  I get to the part on my jogging route where there is a long dark road with only one street light and, wouldn’t you know it, about 200 yards ahead there is a small woman walking her dog.  I am a 6’4 225 pound guy and I am quickly closing the gap between us and I am thinking, “oh shit I need to get her attention bc if I just run up behind her I am going to scare the hell out of her.”  So I do what I usually do if I am running up behind someone and when I got about 40-50 yards away I did a big cough. She didn’t turn around.  Then I did a little throat clear like “cough cough excuse me”, nothing, she doesn’t turn around.  Now, I am about 10-15 yards behind her and I realize she has headphones in her ears.  Also, we are getting to the part of the road with the only street light.  I see my shadow, which looks much bigger than I am for real, slowly creep over her. She whips around with the most animalistic face I have ever seen. Her face was complete and utter terror mixed with extreme aggression. She put her hands out in front of her face like claws and crouched and screamed an awful sound.  Not like a movie scream either, like an animal, a real human scream. \n\nOf course I stop jogging bc I am now “running at her”.  Well, when I stop, I guess she figured now I am going to try to kill her or something bc her face turned even more wild and she screamed a horrible scream again, full throated right in my face! The type of scream that gives you chills to hear.  I put my hands up on the top of my head bc I figured that was the most non threatening thing I could do and went around her in the grass giving her the road.  All the while she is still in this crouching animal pose with her “claws” out, teeth out, and screaming.  I said “sorry sorry sorry sorry” as I went around her and then kept jogging.  I looked back at her and she was now crouched over with her hand on her chest and looked like she was catching her breath.\n\nI recognized her as someone who lived down the street. I saw her a couple days later walking her dog and told her I was sorry for the confusion.  She was super embarrassed and laughed and said, “no that’s my fault I shouldn’t have had my headphones in that late, I was listening to a murder podcast. It wasn’t your fault.”  \n\nTLTR:  I was jogging at night and accidentally triggered the fight of the fight or flight response in my neighbor.",

I was walking my dog kinda late one night and a guy ran up on me with a knife in his hand, I'm assuming to rob me. He seemed really fucked up on drugs too, cuz he was like talking to himself and shit and moving weird... I could hear him going on before he noticed me and he was walking all crazy, plus his voice just sounded off, so I definitely think he was fucked up... oh yeah and I also have a 125 pound English Mastiff, so my dog is kinda scary to most folks, so I definitely think he wasn't thinking about what he was doing to charge at me while I was walking my giant ass dog. \n\n\nBut I noticed him early and was like on alert before he ever noticed me and he had a pistol pointed straight at him before he got within 20 feet of me. I know this isn't something scary like, oh I found a dead body scary, but shit it scared me pretty damn good, I was scared when I first saw him,  scared when he ran up on me, really really scared when I saw he had a knife in his hand, and scared when he ran away too. Sorry but I'm not trying to get stabbed with a knife and I don't want to take someone else's life so I'm glad he came to whatever senses he had left and gave up on it... sometimes that doesn't happen and bad things happen. \n\n\nAnd the scariest part is this happened in my sort of quiet neighborhood one street over from my own home, and normally shit like that doesn't happen where I live, at least not like in my immediate neighborhood.

While I was passed out, I had a strange, vivid dream in which I was outside looking up at a dark red sickle moon, and was suddenly approached by someone who stabbed me. I woke up just at the point of dying in the dream.   \nTo shake off the bad vibes from the dream, I decided to go out for a walk. It was around 11pm. After getting to the end of my block, and turning down the side street, I noticed a van cruising suspiciously behind me, so I slowed down and let them get ahead of me. At first they paused, and I could see some kind of movement inside, but eventually they drove off very aggressively, tires squealing, and vanished around the next corner.   \nI continued walking, and went to cross the road. Until this point, the sky had been obscured by all of the large neighborhood trees. But as I moved towards the intersection, the trees ended, and as I looked up, I saw the same kind of red sliver of a moon in the sky from my dream, and got chills. As I started crossed the road, I saw another man walking towards me giving off an odd energy, kind of looking too directly at me. I always carry a knife, so I had my hand on my hip ready to pull it, if needed. Just as the man passed me, he looked me dead in the eyes and said, \"Turn around, man.... you need to turn around.\" I was in the middle of the street, and fairly bewildered by everything, so I continued to cross. But after standing there on the sidewalk for a few minutes, I decided to heed the warning signs, circled around the next two blocks and went the fuck home. Found out the next morning someone in that area had been stabbed.",

I figure that they may only be drunk and keep jogging toward them.  Then they start raising the arm that is apposite to the leg they are stepping with above their head and slowly lowering it back down every step.  Maybe they are really drunk, or high. \n\nAs I get closer, I start to notice that when they step, their legs are bending the wrong way.  I am starting to freak out.  Something is definitely wrong.

The next day we went through the woods where we heard the noise and confirmed it, coyote tracks and scat. They were probably after our small dog.

Now I’m a tall but weedy guy but I grew up in gangland London so I’m not a wimp, I can hold my own, I also am the only boy in my family with 5 sisters so as another second passed it clicked in my head that the lady is terrified that this guy must of been following her for a while, I was immediately enraged with anger. I pulled my hood up to render my face in darkness and put both my hands in the pouch pocket of my hoodie to make it look like I had a weapon (if anyone remembers the drug dealers from from GTA SA, that’s how I looked) I stepped out and started to follow the guy who is still following the girl, he didn’t notice me at first as he was still fixed on the girl so I decide to just follow him, matching his footsteps with mine while trying to make all my body language show that I see him as my prey, hoping to install the same fear in him but he still has not looked back and we had started to get to an area which is mostly parks and non residential streets and I knew it would be too dangerous to let them get that far so I started whistling the tune from mockingjay as low and creepily as I could so that only the guy could hear it, and as I did he looked back at me quickly and I could see proper fear in his eyes, I was smiling so hard but I doubt he could see because my face was obscured by my hood, and as he looked back at me the girl took a right turn onto one of the last residential streets, the guy kept walking but I was hyped now I knew this guy had been caught completely off guard so I start closing the distance on him which made him miss the turning the girl had walked down, as I was passing the turning I looked down the road for the girl but she was almost at the other end of the road so she must of run as soon as she turned the corner, so I kept following the guy and he’s rubbernecking to look over his shoulder at me so bad whilst walking away so I started to call him in the deepest voice I could “oi bruv” “oi come here now” and as I did the guy started sprinting so I started sprinting after him, just to keep the heat on him, I chased him for about another mile before he ran unto an area which is just overgrown wasteland full of heroin needles and rusty nails so I stopped at that point and just took a leisurely walk home.",

He slammed on the breaks but without being able to see it was only a matter of time before he ran into several small trees that had been planted a few months back and eventually what I assume is a transformer (one of those metal boxes on the side of the road you occasionally see electricians maintnancing) thankfully everyone was ok, he was able to reduce his speed enough that he walked away from the accident but it was something out of a comedy movie until you realize he or any number of others could have died. Don't drag race kids!",

We had left 7 11 and were on our way back to her house when an older green car pulled up beside us, they drove along side us for awhile and we tried to keep our cool and moved farther up into the yards to walk, then on the count of 3 we ran.. the car sped up and kept up with us, we started running thru bushes so they couldn't see us and the car slowed down AA it was looking for us. We came across a fence low enough we could hop over and hid behind in someone's yard and the car stopped in front of the house for a few, then slowly drove off.

            "text": "Not exactly a willing walk, but...\n\nA while back, I was homeless and living out of shelters while I was trying to get my shit together. For context, the main shelter I went to had a lottery system for when there were more guests than beds where if your number on the waitlist was pulled, you wouldn't be getting a bed and you had to relocate elsewhere. Furthermore, if your number was further down the list of lotto'd guests, it became much harder to get a bed because the guests who had their numbers pulled first would be prioritized when people would no-show (which happened frequently). I hated that lottery system.\n\nThis night, guess who was one of the six that got their number pulled and was far enough on the list that they weren't able to get in even after no-shows? Me. Fortunately, I got lucky and was booked to a different shelter at a downtown street. Unfortunately, the shelter had a deadline for me to get there, and the next bus wasn't coming until after it would have been 15 minutes too late for my scheduled arrival. So I decided to hoof it instead. Being a female bodied and almost-unarmed guy in his 20s, this was already a horribly stupid move, but it was either walk or risk arrest for sleeping on the wrong stretch of concrete.\n\nNot a whole lot happened on the first half of the journey, surprisingly. It was actually pretty peaceful at points, save for the occasional late night group and wandering/sleeping fellow hobos. It was when I reached the second half of my walk that shit went down.\n\nI was heading down the last stretch of sidewalk needed to get to my destination when I start hearing someone screaming in agony. A distant \"Aaaargh... AAAARGH...\" filled the air and only got louder the closer I got. I happened to look down at my side and I instantly found the source of the noise; a crackhead who was lying on the sidewalk, screaming incoherently at the top of his lungs. I started feeling an intense drop in my gut like I had to get out of there now, and then we locked eyes.\n\nThat's when I fucking booked it. Immediately broke into a run and the screaming started raising a few octaves. I look behind me and this crackhead had gotten up and was starting to follow me, so I ran even faster and did not stop until I reached my destination and was absolutely sure I was safe. I'm embarrassed to say I had not gone to the bathroom before my trip and I ended up pissing my jeans in the ensuing run. I had to take a shower and get my pants cleaned when I got my bed made and my stuff settled in.\n\nTo date, that was the absolute scariest moment I had when I was out walking at night. There were other freaky night walk moments, but I still can remember my hairs standing on end and my jeans inexplicably growing wet and warm when I happened to look back and see I was being pursued.

For a few seconds I get ready to have to fight but then remember my stepfather’s advice to always run if you can as nothing is worth risking life. \n\nI calm myself and reach for my phone to get ready to give it the guy when all of a sudden I hear footsteps quickly coming at me and it’s the man demanding for me to give him everything with a giant chef’s(?) knife. Unfortunately I threw my phone at him in a panic and it hit him on the chest. He got angry and tried to slash me twice. I don’t know, but I managed to lunge out of the way and say in my broken Spanish that that’s all I have and to just take it. He was saying something but between the panic and the mask covering his face I couldn’t understand or register (now I realize he wanted my wallet-duh) so I just ran like my life depended on it. I didn’t look back for a good 100 yards or so and by then he was gone.\n\nLooking back, I should’ve have just given him my phone and wallet.

            "text": "Wasn't exactly \"seeing\", but OP's question and some of the other comments reminded me of an incident, of sorts, that took place when I was in college, which I haven't thought of in years. \n\nIt was during summer break several years ago, and I was visiting my parents for a couple weeks. To set the scene, they live in a small subdivision near the edge of a small town in western Michigan, not far from where it turns into the surrounding countryside. For further context, I'm a 6 foot male, probably about 190lbs at the time. Trying to stay relatively active, I would go out for a walk/run most days; in this case it was probably around 9:30-10:00 at night, since it was hot and humid in the afternoons.\n\nAnyway, I left the house and went around the neighborhood for awhile like I did most other evenings, and then was going to go out of their subdivision,  following the town's main street/a state highway. Twilight was well underway, and it was mostly dark, but streetlights were on, so it wasn't a big deal. Then, as I came back around the neighborhood in front of my parents' house, preparing to head out, I heard it: shuffling behind me on the street. It sounded human, definitely not running, but a pretty insistent shuffling noise.\n\nI kept walking for a little bit, expecting it to turn off. I was still inside the neighborhood, and there's an apartment complex down a little road at the very end of the subdivision, plus plenty of other residences on the way out of town, so it didn't feel that abnormal for someone else to be walking. However, as I kept on, it stayed behind me. I walked a little faster. As I turned onto the sidewalk along the main street, it turned with me. Eventually, I got to the point of kind of being pretty freaked out, and so, at a crossroads, I moved across to a well-lit gas station with a few cars there. The shuffling kept going the way I had been, and when I looked back across the street, I couldn't see anything. \n\nFor all I know, it was just someone going home to their house or apartment, and absolutely nothing would have happened. My belief is that's probably the case, but being in the dark and having seen the amount of true-crime shows that I have, my brain and body prepared for the worst-case. Still, that gas station is the last place with any guaranteed lights on that road for awhile, and I had originally planned to walk on further. Suffice it to say, I had plenty of adrenaline and some chills afterward on the way home, and locking the door behind me was a serious relief. Being followed in the dark by you-know-not-what is creepy.\n\nTL;DR. Weird shuffling noises followed me through a neighborhood for longer than seemed normal and disappeared after I got into a lighted area.",

We went off calling for him, and right as we screamed his name, a giant green light lit up the entire graveyard over a wall of bushes.

We followed where the light came from behind the bushes and found our friends phone, sweater, and a stick he was using as a cane.

He turns the corner and he stops because he knows we didn't keep going through the park. He turns his phone flashlight on and slowly walks around the park in a half crouch searching the park repeating in a slow and soft voice \"Im not gonna hurt you guys\" barely missing us by about 6 feet and after an unsuccessful circle around the park he turns off his phone flashlight he stands up straighter and his voice becomes deeper and more serious \"im with the RCMP, youre not in trouble girls i just need to talk\" he waits. \"Come out now before we find you\" he says clearly frustrated. After that he goes back towards the entrance and makes a phone call that neither me or my friend heard. But we hear a car door slam at the exit of the park and 3 men come to talk with the other man where they argue about how we couldn't have left because they would've seen us.

Not the most dangerous place lmao. But on one side, there is a council estate, and on the other, a rather vast woodland. These are where I've had a few experiences.\n\nOne was a few months ago. I was walking through a path in the woods leading back to my residential area, in the dead of night. It was completely black everywhere except for what was illuminated by my phone torch. A person walked past me, heading back into the woods, wearing all black and a mask that covered his entire face. It wasnt a normal mask youd see during the pandemic, none of his face was visible at all. I am 100% sure because I pointed my torch right at him. He walked in an almost robotic manner, and his head stayed straight without flinching at all. Nothing happened to me, but it was really odd.\n\nAnother was when I bumped into someone on a street corner in the council estate who had recently got out of jail for killing someone. He beckoned me over to his group, who were drinking. I did, because I have intense anxiety and didnt want to be seen ignoring him. Turns out he was pretty sound though, gave me a few cans of beer and was all round really nice and friendly. Offered to sell me weed and I said no and left.\n\nThe scariest one was a few weeks ago. This occurred on the main road that runs between my area and the council estate. I joined up to the main road whilst smoking a joint, and I saw a guy standing still on the street corner. Normal, but I did wonder what he was doing there at around 3am, especially considering he wasnt even using his phone to anything, just standing doing nothing. Again, I'm awkward and anxious, so I crossed to the other side of the road as to not have to walk directly past him. Upon doing so I noticed he did the same, following around 10 feet behind me. I kept walking. I then crossed back to the other side, as to avoid him, and I noticed he did the same again. He was around 10 feet behind me this entire time, matching my movements. I crossed back over again, and he also did the same. He'd now followed 3 of my crosses, which is what convinced me that it was beyond a coincidence. I was definitely being followed. The oddest part of it all is that I was getting faster the whole time. By the end I was almost in a jog. But he maintained the same distance.\n\nIn retrospect, I assume he was just waiting for a drug dealer he was unfamiliar with, and thought it was me. Maybe he thought he was to follow me into a less public area. I think this is more likely than him having sinister intentions.\n\nI'm sure I've had some other scary things happen. My memory is terrible. I doubt this will get any attention, but I'll try remember if it does. My walks tonight are gonna hit different after reading this thread lol.\n\noh also side note, none of this is fake or embellished. You can check my profile, I never answer these threads or tell any stories, this is my first opportunity to write about an experience of mine lol\n\nAlso fox noises are scarier than all of this combined.

My dad was at it again with my mom, so we decided to take a long walk late at night. We were staying in a vacation condo complex more on the outskirts of town, not exactly on a busy/well-lit city street. For most of our walk, I don't think there were even sidewalks or streetlamps, so it was already kind of creepy. We didn't pass any public businesses, just a lot more condo/apartment complexes. \n\nFinally, we passed one of those apartment complexes that has the doors to each apartment on the outside, with outdoor staircases and hallways. There was a person (I remember it as a red-haired woman, but my mom remembers it as a man) lying facedown and completely still in the concrete walkway between staircases, right under the light as if in a spotlight.\n\nMy mom turned us around to go back then. I watched the facedown figure till we were out of sight, and I never saw them twitch. I whispered, \"Was that person okay?\" and my mom said, \"I don't know, but we're not hanging around to get involved.\" The rest of the dark walk back to the condos was probably the longest of my life; it was like I had newly realized that being out walking late at night wasn't safe, and my hair stood on end the few times another person walked by on the other side of the road. \n\nThe condo didn't feel super safe either, with my dad snarling at my mom (to answer your question, he was mad at her because she was sad that he'd cheated on her), but at least we were inside.   \n\n\nTl;dr: My mom and I saw a person who may or may not have been dead during a late-night walk in California.",

The dog was not reacting. A minute or two later someone comes running down the street yelling at me. \n\nApparently the doggo was deaf and could not hear anything that I was saying. It seems that the safety/visibility LED bracelet I was wearing was kind of freaking the dog out he wasn't barking because he was angry or aggressive, he was just super weirded out by it. \n\nAs the owner was approaching the dog lunged at me bit down on my wrist but not to hurt me, he just tore the LED bracelet off and started prancing around in circles around me proud of his new prize.\n\nI tried to help the owner wrangle the dog, but since he was less than a year old and about 80 lb it was pretty much impossible for me. The owner ended up saying that I shouldn't worry and he always comes home when he does escape, and so as I finished the walk back to my house I had a little pitbull escort.",

The groups of criminals on their most definitely stolen bikes casing the neighbourhood on other hand is not comical but still for me just adds to the cathartic experience of running at this time. Possibly borderline scary would be having a rather large biker looking Gentleman wake up and stand up immediately from a pile of bushes in front of me. This being at probably around 1am on the side of a main city road in front of a business. Fortunately he did not even seem to notice me huffing and puffing and just stumbled across the street out of my way.  I would have to say the one single thing so far that has come close to actually putting fear in me is when I was running through the more rural part of the neighbourhood and came up to a Doe and her fawn.  For some reason I did not even notice them until I was about 10 feet from them.  The way that Doe side eyed me and stood her ground was very serious.  She was not running away while her fawn stood and ate.  I crossed the street without question.  I even looked over my shoulder a few times as I ran away.",

There were a few moments that were seriously creepy.\n\nI remember walking around the back of some of the building, hospitals have so many fucking buildings it's like a small village. Anyway i saw these steps leading down into what must've been a maintenance entry.it was off one of the main 'streets' 'roads' I don't know this place was massive. It had been raining pretty heavily so the stair well was flooded a good few feet at least.\n\n The doors were creaking and swaying slightly. I kinda stood in the water a bit and reached down to push one of the doors open. It was dark so I couldn't see much, one of the street lights illuminated parts of the hallway the doors lead into. It was creepy af, just doors swaying in the water, fingers cabinet's with open drawers and papers floating. I dunno it looked like something from a movie. I was just staring into this hallway when a giant flock of pigeons flew from one end of the corridor toward me. I nearly shit myself, in the dark it looked a rushing mass of shadows flying toward me! I thought it was a fucking witch or something.\n\nI have never been so freaked out in my entire life.\n\nSaw some other weird shit there, a corridor of beds and one 'bay, or whatever you call a bed with the sheets drawn around it, and the light in that 'bay' was on then off the on again. I stood by one of the entrance doors and this long corridor stretched put with one light turning on and off. It was freaky. I used to carry a camcorder around with me (before phones were like they are now) I filmed it for a few minutes before my imagination started to fuck with me.\n\nThere was loads of kinda interesting stuff around there. Rooms that hadn't been cleaned out so all the records were there, mastectomy charts, test tubes, broken ventilators. There was even a small courtyard with one pram in its center. \n\nThe creepiest thing I saw was whilst the rain was chucking it down like vertical sheets of water. I was under a metal stairwell trying roll a cigarette. To one side there was a large building with a glass roof of sorts. It had a large pane of glass at the front. I'm not describing this very well. But basically from the stairwell looking up I could see through into the top of this other building. There were no cars around. Otherwise I would have said what I saw was a cars lights.\n\nIt was dark but whatever was sliding across the ceiling of that building was darker, like a sliding shadow. Weird to describe it now. I don't know how else to explain it. A long sliding blacker than black wall of shadow sliding across the ceiling. Moving like shadows do when a car passes the window of a building.\n\nI went out into the rain after that. I never went back to that place.",

I was having fever, I was on heavy painkillers, barely awake, but I slipped on some house slippers and went.\nHere I was, roaming crouched in the badly lit streets, wearing some old Harry Potter pj's when my nose starts bleeding, an issue I have every time I have fever, so no big deal for me, it will be over in 10 minutes. I cross the street when I hear someone call my name from under a tree. I turned my head and did not recognize the person (wasn't wearing my glasses and it was dark) so I just kept walking. I heard rushed voices and footsteps and kept walking, thinking it was just some neighbor's kids playing around and who knew me. I finally found the key in my father's friend's alley and went back home.\n\nThe next Monday I get texts from my best friend asking if I'm OK, and screenshots of the class's group chat where a boy kept asking if someone knew why I wasn't attending school anymore, because he thought I got kidnapped. My bsf tried to reassure them by saying he knew how I was and why I changed school, but the boy kept going about how he saw me walking like a zombie with an empty look and bloody face.",

            "text": "Buried deep but this is straight on deliverance in Big Sur.  Not a walk but a backpacking trip.\n\n  In the early  90's when I was in college I went backpacking with my boyfriend in the Ventana wilderness.  Our route was a 20 mile hike to a famous hot springs.  My boyfriend and I being as backcountry as we were took several tabs of acid at the trailhead.  It was great;  we  tripped balls the entire route; saw our power spots, nature spirits, cloud sky mushrooms, the whole shebang. 👍\n\n We did our 20 miles and got to the campsite around dusk still buzzin. The camp sites were  nothing more than a few cleared areas along a rocky slope. The  hotspring  was about another mile  upstream and we couldn't see any other camps through the heavy brush and falling darkness. I went down to the stream to wash and was giggling at  the little fishies.  I didn't see anyone else.   My boyfriend then came down to the water and went \"sssshhhhh\" and took me back to our stuff and told me just stay still and be quiet.   \n\nWhen he had gone upstream to look for firewood he had come about 6 or 7 sketch hippy/homeless guys at a camp that looked suspiciously permanent.  What my boyfriend didn't tell me was that they had some impressive hunting knives  and  seemed way too interested in the giggling.  Must not be easy to get a date 30 miles from a paved road! \n\nIt's now full dark and it's  black as the bottom of a mine in this Canyon.  We were tired and coming down so we just sacked out and didn't set up our tent. We didnt sleep well since our camp was a rocky slope  so hours later we both immediately woke when we heard the stealthy crackle of footsteps slowly sneaking up on us. Definitely three maybe four people.   My boyfriend whispered to me to go a short distance and hide when he signaled by squeezing my arm.   When he did I crept off a short distance where I was totally invisible in the dark. \n\nThen there was a ungodly scream and an enormous rock crashed down the slope just missing me. It was my boyfriend doing his he-man best to scare off the marauders but he almost took me out too.  Then a whole lot of crashing, screaming, thrashing around.  More rocks crashed down the hill.  My heart was thumping in absolute pant-shittin terror.  Seemed like hours but then it got deathly quiet. \n\n I fumble around in the dark until I feel my boyfriend grab my arm and hiss \"let's go!\".  So we grope around in the pitch black in our torn apart camp, grab a sleeping bag, a water bottle and stumble around in a panic until we find the trail.  We were full on committed to getting somewhere else before these guys came back with reinforcements.\n\n We get maybe a mile down the trail and realize we are likely to fall off a cliff in the pitch black. We also simply too tired to go on (twenty miles is a looooong hike).  All our stuff, headlamps, food, backpacks are back up the trail. We don't care, we just sack out in the middle of the trail on the one sleeping bag.\n\n  We  wake shortly after dawn when some hikers almost step on us.  It's two stout lads that agree to hike with us and maybe help us get our stuff back.  We get back to the \"camp\" and EVERYTHING is gone.   My boyfriend and our trail buddies confront the sketch hippy guys at their camp.  They were not friendly to say the least.  Plus it was so dark that night they had culpable deniability lol.  \n\nAfterward we go with our two stout lads to check out the amazing hot springs.  It wasn't the paradise described in the Lonely Planet guide haha.  There are at least 12 to 15 sketch hippie types wallowing in the spring  including a couple women and kids.  All naked, all stinky and the area around the spring was disgusting with trash.\n\nWe hiked out that day a lot poorer. Bye bye good  backpack 😢  Thank god my car keys were in my pants zipper pocket!  Kept seeing rainbow trails the entire hike out yeah!  🌈\n\nTLR: Boyfriend and I  hike 20 miles to a hot spring in Big Sur tripping on acid.  Get attacked at night by the rainbow tribe and flee in terror.  Return in the morning to find all our gear stolen and the hot spring full of stinky hippies.",

Moments later I see the stalker walking down the alley in front of my house and down the road as he's looking around for me. After he was out of sight I unlocked my front door and ran inside as I closed all the curtains. Family got home almost minutes later.

I get about halfway up to where there’s a landing and I realize I can hear whispering. I stopped and listened a bit harder and yes it was very clearly someone whispering something right on the other side of the chain link but I couldn’t see anyone. The odd part was I could not understand any of what was being said, and it seemed like one voice which I thought was odd for like:.. one person to be alone in the woods whispering so I said “hello?” \n\nSuddenly I felt the most visceral terror go through my body and I fucking RAN. \nThere was no increase in noise, I didn’t see anything and nothing changed it was just like as soon as I said hello something in my little body said get the fuck outta there. Super fucking bizarre. I ran the whole way home and trust me I was not an athletic child. \n\nWeirdly I never really thought much of that or even told anyone about it. \n\nIt maybe must have been some small town fucko being a creep, which is honestly the more scary option to me than like ghosts and demons haha. Either way, it was so fucking weird and creepy I am so glad I don’t live in that town anymore.",

I was at my friends house (we live in a suburban/countryside town) and my phone had died so i didnt bother trying to call my mom or dad to collect me sinse it was only about a 35 min walk under street light and i thought it might be nice. It was around 10:30 at night during Autumn so it was very dark out. I started walking and about 7 minutes in i noticed someone was following me from a distance, i couldnt make out there features because of the gap between the street lights causing instances of darkness. I was of cource freaked out but composed myself, i thought il be home before there close to me and even if they do its probebly just some random person walking home too but if it was someone looking for trouble i could scare them off (btw i was a 6ft athletic guy) i continued walking until a while later i looked back and they were far closer towards me since i noticed they were speed walking. I built up some courage and took the keys out of my pocket and got ready to fight if i needed to. While walking i purposely stood on my shoelaces so i could stop and tie them. I did so with my keys in my coat pocket ready, while tieing them i slyly looked to try and make out the person. I tied my laces and put my hand in the pocket with the keys and waited for about 30 seconds to be closer to the person. When the person came close i saw it was a young blonde woman who had a cut on her head and was limping. I stood back in shock and then went over to her with caution. I asked if she was ok and if she needed help. She opened her mouth to show me it was bleeding but said \"boyfriend after me\" with a scared tone. I told her i was gonna help her and ran to the nearest house and bashed on the front door until someone answered and i used called the cops. I ran back over to the girl who was stood facing the way she came from. The cops arrived and she still stared at the way she came. They took me and her in. We said everything and i believe she was staring down the road because she was expecting or waiting for her boyfriend to come at any second.",

There were old trails and roads all through the area and it was remote and heavily treed etc. I’d met some guys to fish and party some. I was driving a old truck and it had been raining off and on for days so the roads were muddy and lots of deep potholes. after a while, everybody left except me and I stayed a bit too late as it was about an half hour before sunset. I was about 3 miles to the desolate road on the way to civilization and as I started back to the main road I came up on a large mud puddle. I hesitated as I thought if it was too deep I could get stuck. Well, I tried to Ford the puddle and I did get stuck. I had a small bottle jack and I tried for a long time to free the truck but couldn’t. This time it was pitch black and new moon so no moonlight. Well shit, now I have to walk out-3 miles at least- so I started walking on this rutted old muddy dirt road w heavy vegetation on each side and my skin was crawling already when about 5 minutes in something begin to walk beside me a few feet off the road cracking twigs and rustling leaves as it matched me step for step. So I decided to jog, might as well start exercising while I’m out here right? it started to jog too and it wasn’t small either. Full on panic, I started running and so did it crashing through the woods right beside me. I was beyond frightened. After about 15 minutes it veered off into the woods. It took another 20 minutes or so to clear the woods onto the old paved road. I was hauling ass and out of breath when I finally hit the highway.",

Now were at the Centre part of the hill where if you even were to jump off, you’d be extremely hurt and that’s literally the only explanation we can make up on where he went to, because the other side of the street was just a brick wall until you get to the top, and we would of seen him going back up the hill even if he did.

We drive up to the end, drink our beers, BS for a few minutes and head back down. When we were driving back down, there was a car parked on the side of the road. Since it's a small road, we had to pass by pretty slowly. As our headlights pointed towards the car, we noticed there was a blue tarp next to it rolled up on the ground, with what appeared to be a person in it, as I could see the top of someone's head sticking out at the end of the tarp. I told my boyfriend to keep driving. I said, \"That's a freakin dead body in that tarp and someone else is out there trying to dispose of it! I don't want to make ANY contact with that fucking person!\" ...But of course, he HAD to back up and get another look, just to be sure... and yes, It was a person in the tarp. We were too freaked to get out of the car so we drove home and immediately got on the phone to call police. We were concerned about the person in the tarp of course, and also about witnessing it, and if someone would be after us next knowing what our vehicle looked like and the direction we drove off in. We could have easily been found if that was the case, cause we lived less than a mile away. We asked the dispatcher to have the officer call us to let us know what the hell was going on with that person in the tarp. Not long after, the officer called us and told us that the person, (man) in the tarp was not dead. He said everything was fine, and that the guy was just too tired to drive so he decided to find a place to pull over and sleep for a while. It all just seemed so freakin sketchy to me. I wanted to ask him why the fuck he thought it'd be a good idea to roll himself in a tarp and sleep outside of his car on the side if the damn road... But I decided not ask anything else about it.

From it came a low sound, like it was hissing. It was black and the size of a dog, but the wrong shape, though I only saw a small part of it, most of it was in shadow. The way it seemed to be hiding and crouching under the bush and making that threatening sound, my adrenaline spiked and I was sure it was going to jump me.\n\nI looked at it for a moment (ready to defend myself, but also curious to understand what I was seeing) and realized it had a smooth and shiny surface and had to be some kind of robotic device rather than an animal, but in the moment with my stone age brain telling me I was in danger and with my pulse racing, at first I couldn't think of any such object that would be that size and lie under a bush like that and give such a sound without moving. I got the image in my head of that episode of Black Mirror where robot dogs have killed everyone, because it was the same shape as those dogs, and I was for a second sure I was going to experience what happens in that episode.\n\nThen the object finally moved out into the light and it was one of those robotic lawn mowers. It took a long moment for my pulse to go back down and I felt very stupid.",

Well one night after work I decided to take a more scenic route through town, rather than the quick way. It was about twice the distance, but the town was small so it didn't really matter. As I was turning on to my street a huge dog started chasing me, it tried to bite me, but I booked it out of there, and got home as fast as possible.\n\n       Our house was on the street right before the street that faced the bay, just a few blocks from the local marina. There was a large sea shell shaped building I believe was owned by either the marina, or the city, that was a perfect stage for a band to play a good sized concert. This area was where most large scale festivals would be staged.\n\n        I decided one late night to go for a walk down towards the marina. It was about a mile and a half to the destination I sought, the inner tip of the break wall, a place that was wonderful at midnight, when noone was around but the walleye in the bay.\n\n       I started along my path along the sidewalks, cutting through my neighbor's yard. It was early spring in Michigan, so there was still some snow on people's lawns that I had to avoid. As I passed a large memorial near one of the beaches, I noticed a truck pass by, nothing too strange, probably just someone heading home from the factory. I walked on a little further, and crossed the main intersection in that area. As I reached the other sidewalk I noticed the same truck drive by, but in the opposite direction, as if it had turned around. I walked on further to the turn towards the break wall, and the same truck passed me one last time. I didn't see it again that night, but it was still terrifying while it happened.",

I used to take night walks all the time with my dad during the summer because he's a teacher and we both loved staying up late.  My town is a safe, fairly small town, so we don't worry too much.  One time, we were heading towards home on one of the main roads in town.  Our house was mostly a straight shot from there, save for a couple of turns on some back roads closer to home.  We walked past here countless times.  \n\nAs we passed one of the store fronts, we saw a man and a woman standing together outside on the sidewalk.  It's not too unusual to see people enjoying the night air in the summer, so we didn't think too much of it.  They had a stroller nearby, so I assumed that they lived in the apartment above the store and had taken out their baby for some fresh air to soothe them.\n\nNow, generally I'm a pretty nervous person, so I try to avoid contact whenever we pass people.  I'm minding my own business as we walk past, but I happen to glance over at the woman who had a bundle in her arms.  I wanted to take a peek at the baby, but that's when I had a very slow, creeping realization.\n\nIt wasn't a baby in her arms.\n\nIt was a baby doll.  Not one of those realistic ones that people sometimes have, either.  It was just a regular  plastic baby doll from the toy aisle.  It was then that I noticed that as the woman was holding it, the man was running what looked like a UV light over the doll's forehead.  My dad and I said nothing, but we immediately crossed the street and took a different route home.  I have no idea what those people were doing with that doll that night, but I still think about it sometimes.  It was easily the weirdest thing I've ever seen in town.",

As we planed the sleep over we thought it would be fun to go for a walk when it was dark, we had many times, just around the neighbourhood. For context this was a very safe neighbourhood and nothing bad had happened the other million times we went walking.\n\nThat night when we went out we just planed to walk around, chat and maybe visit the local playground. We had even told my friends Mum where we were going.\n\nas we were walking on the sidewalk a black range rover turned the corner and started driving towards us, slowly. As they neared they rolled down one of their windows- I heard one of them say ‘hey’ but that’s all. Since I was the closest I caught a glimpse of the two in the car- it was night time so it was hard to see but it looked like two middle-age men. We just kept walking not wanting to get involve. We hadn’t thought much of it at this point- maybe they wanted directions? \n\ni was next to one of my friends but the other one was across the street from us, we got separated. I started walking faster towards the driveway as I started to get paranoid, my heart was racing. \nI hid in the driveway, As I watched my friends also get out of sight. \n\nThe car drove by us, and at this point we had all grouped up again. the car drove down the road a little before turning around. At that moment we all thought it was sketchy, we made a beeline to a busier street. We planed to lose the car and run back to my friends house (which was only 2 blocks away). We ran when we saw the headlights coming back.\n\nsprinting down the road, we looked back, those same headlights were following us. We acted fast and all clumsy hid behind the same tree as the car passed us. We sprinted back up the road to where we came from. I thought I was going to trip.\n\nthis car would just not leave us alone- it turned around again. We all dove into the neighbours bushes before it arrived and held our breaths. The car turned onto the road again, we saw the headlights but this time the car just kept driving. \n\nwe waited a minute to see if the car would  turn around again, yet we didn’t see it. with adrenaline pumping through our veins we ran back to my friends house like a bunch of headless chickens.\n\nThat night we hardly slept. We ended up talking about it most of the night, still paranoid.\n\nThis occurrence only lasted around five minutes, but it felt so much longer. \n\nit’s been years since the incident... but I still think about it today. In a way it’s gotten easier to laugh about it (we were kind of dumb) but to think what could’ve happened if we didn’t get away terrifies me.

My bf had a super bright spotlight and quickly shined it in the direction of the animal and we found ourselves looking at something that looked exactly like a raccoon but clearly had a tail that looked like it came off a ring-tailed lemer.

If you want to take my curse, so be it.\n\nI ask her what's going on, she said there's someone in the woods that isn't responding and that she left her phone in the woods... And im like.... Ok.\n\nShe says \"ok I'm Gunna go back now\" and she heads for the woods as I'm calling 911. \n\nI am sticking to the entrance of that store like glue in case she tried anything weird and I told the people at 911 the story, the cops show up, I tell them about this super fishy incident. I have no idea where in the woods this lady went, and I was absolutely not going to follow her.\n\nWhy didn't she ask the 2 dudes she passed for help to call 911? Why me? Why so calm? Why go back in the woods and not wait to show the police where to go? Why was her phone in the woods?\n\nIt just felt like some kind of weird trap. The police told me I could go, so I started the long walk from qfc to my bus stop... I was so scared she was Gunna run out from the woods with a gun or something, I booked it and kept looking behind me.\n\nI never heard anything about what happened that night, nothing in the news at all. This was late 2019.\n\nOut of my year and a half in Seattle this is the weirdest and scariest thing to happen to me.",

But as I got into better shape, I decided to push myself and left my neighborhood, crossing a road that turns into an interstate, and jog around a strip mall before crossing back to go home. As I was jogging around the strip mall, I became convinced someone was following me. It was an older man with a scraggly, salt and pepper beard in an old junker of a maroon sedan, maybe an old Monte Carlo. I was super scared and booked it to a 24-hour diner across a couple parking lots in the big strip mall. There were cops inside and at first, naturally, I thought I should go in and let them know I thought I was being stalked and needed help getting home safely (only maybe a 5 minute drive away). But I got embarrassed as a dumb teen and started second-guessing myself and also didn't want to be seen in public all gross and red and sweating from my long run, so I just hung out outside the door until I felt I'd waited long enough and the guy was gone. I started jogging home and was feeling relieved I didn't bother the cops on their break as, at first, there was no sign of the car. As I started running back across the interstate, a car driving maybe 250 meters away, screeched to a halt and flipped a bitch. It was that maroon junker! I tried to run as fast as I could across the street. There was a fire station at the top of a small hill and I thought if I ran fast enough, I could make it. But my legs were rubber from my long run and I couldn't  push myself up that hill with any real speed and all that set in as I finally finished crossing the interstate. I just dove into a fairly deep ditch on the side of the road and laid there, facedown, hands over my head, eyes closed. I heard a car pull over and heard someone pacing around and muttering above me. I focused on trying not to breathe or move for what felt like several minutes, but could have been only seconds. I heard an angry exclamation and footsteps heading away, a car door slam, a car driving away. I laid there for at least another 20 minutes. I didn't know if I should go downhill, back to the diner, or uphill to the fire station. I ended up doing neither, I was afraid of being on either road at that point. I ran across a small field where I needed to jump a fence into someone's backyard and then jump the same fence to their front yard and then I was in my neighborhood again and ran downhill the couple blocks to my house. That was the most terrifying experience of my life. I've never gone on an early morning jog since. It's been over 20 years now.",

My mum also trusted me to ride my bike alone as the neighbourhood was very safe and she knew I would never get myself into trouble. But if I did I would ride home or get help myself. \n\nHowever on one night, just before dinner I decided to go out for a ride. Even though it was getting dark, my mum allowed me to as I was just going to ride around the block. Would only take 10 mins at most. So I headed out on my BMX bike. \n\nEverything was perfectly normally until I was returning home. I noticed a car coming the opposite way driving a little slow with about 3 teenagers in it (Could’ve been older but roughly that age). They were looking at me and talking to one another. But I ignored them and carried on home as I was only about 6 or 7 houses away. Suddenly they turned around so they were right next to me. The passenger window came down, and one of them started talking to me. He started off by saying something like, “Hey little boy, we can drop you off, just get in” I then responded with “No it’s okay, I live really close. Thank you though”. He then tried once more by saying “It’s okay I know your parents, it’s safe so get in” a guy in the back then opened the closest back door and waved me in. \n\nAt this point I was starting to get worried as I could tell something wasn’t right (even at the age of 6-7). I decided to ignore him and started to walk my bike home. I heard his car door open and him get out of the car. I looked back and I could see him then start to walk towards me. While looking me dead in the eyes and smiling. This frightened the shit outta me so I got on my bike and started to ride home. I could then hear him start to race after me. As his footsteps got louder and louder and more menacing. I was thankfully just able to get up my driveway before he could get his hands on me. I raced inside, as the back door was unlocked (so I could get in myself) slammed it and then locked it. \n\nI made my way into the kitchen, to thankfully see my mum standing there making dinner. I then told her that some people had offered me a ride home. But that I had been scared and ran home (I didn’t tell her that he chased me, as I didn’t want to scare her). She then told me I did the right thing, and that she was proud of me for being a smart boy. She then said to go upstairs and have a rest before dinner. As I made my way upstairs, I looked outside of the front window to see the guy get back into his car and drive off. I then walked back upstairs to have said rest and later enjoyed a nice dinner with my mum. \n\nI still think about this to this day, and wonder what would’ve happened to me if I had gotten into their car, or if he had caught me. And if I would’ve become another horrible story of a child getting kidnapped.",

Not a long walk, but by no means short in the dark for a child. \n\nMy turn was up and I started down the path, tiny dim flashlight pretty much useless. I forgot this was happening, so I was unprepared. I just followed the thankfully wide trail between a steep hillside to my right and the treeline to my left with a quick pace and diligent steps (because screw that). It seemed fine. One of the counselors had a dog with us. My friends were waiting for me at the finish. \n\nI get to the end of the trail and giggle and say I was happy the dog was running around the trail/keeping us company. The counselor stares at me, gets quiet, and fucks off to quietly phone the other counselors at the start of the trail. Turns out doggo was at home and what I saw was a mountain lion.",

I saw some old man in the neighborhood so I approached him for talking. I didn’t wanted be alone. We talked 2-3 minutes. I asked him what he is doing here and he told me that he is living in building where I live. And he talked about his family problems and complained about his sister. Told me that she banished me out from our mother’s house and etc. Then I looked away for 10 seconds and when I looked back to him he was sleep. I shocked and asked him - if he is sleepy why he doesn’t go home. But he didn’t answered. I laughed and go home. Didn’t understand what the hell is going on. I tried sleep but I dreamt this man and someone was saying why you didn’t help him he is dead. And I got up and came back. He was still sleeping in exact same position. I tried to wake him up but he didn’t wake. I scared as fuck. And called ambulance. It was funny because I was calling ambulance for someone who is sleep. They came and tried to wake him up. Dr asked me how long does he staying like this with shocked face. When I answered and asked why, he said that the man is dead. I shocked and couldn’t believe him. I was literally talking with this man 10 minutes ago. Police came, asked a few questions. They also didn’t believe me. They looked the cameras man died when I was not looking at him.

I’ll try again, sorry if this is a waste or your time:\n\nI was on the Faroe Islands a couple summers ago, first time I experienced midnight sun, but it was cloudy, so everything was so eery and twilight-y.\n\nI decided to go to the beach at midnight, walked down the road from my airbnb and when I got to a bend where another road joins, a pickup truck that was just sitting there suddenly turned its lights on. I don’t know why they were just sitting in a dark truck at night or how long they’d been there.\n\nThe truck drove up the road I’d just come from, so I assumed they lived up there as it was a dead end. I walked around the bend and further down the road and just before I got to the road turning onto the beach, the truck came back down, drove past me at a scary speed and turned towards the beach.\n\nTo avoid bumping into them, I walked past the beach road for a bit and then turned around to go home. After turning around, the truck came back up from the beach, drove past me again and down the road I was just coming from, which leads out of the village onto a motorway, again at a scary speed.\n\nI though the beach is free now, so I walked down the road to it and saw the tuck’s tire tracks in the sand. They drove down, across the beach, through the shallow water and back up.\n\nDuring the whole thing, I kept thinking “this is it, this village will sacrifice me to their island deity”. But the scariest part is that I don’t know what I saw on the beach. Walking to the beach, I thought “what if they left something there?”, but I now just have a blank spot on that memory. Maybe it’s a blank spot because there was nothing there worth remembering, maybe I saw something and I tried to forget it, but I just always have this gap or blemish on that spot when I try to remember it.\n\nI did have an unrelated close call with a ravine that would have killed me there as well, and those island feel so strange, like someone taking a blade to my soul, it’s so hard to describe. It’s a weird, magical place and since I got back, I constantly feel like I have to go back, as if I lost something there, and my mind keeps spinning theories about how that beach wants me to remember something, which I know is superstitious BS. \n\nSorry, I again feel like this sounds boring, I don’t know how to describe it without embellishing, but the entire situation was terrifying to me, and still is.\n\nTL;DR: Weird encounter with a truck in the twilight of a midnight sun, incomplete memory.",
