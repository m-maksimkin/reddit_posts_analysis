I‚Äôve used them since 2005, and I love seeing what all my past connections/friends/family are up to in their lives. It makes me feel good to see them having interesting lives and sharing it with me. Honestly I think I would be depressed if they were down forever because I would feel like I lost a connection to so many people, even if they were ‚Äúshallow‚Äù connections. I get that fb does some evil shit, but I‚Äôve generally been able to keep my feed pretty clear of that stuff. \n\nSometimes I think Reddit hates fb and insta because they hate everyone who has ever been in their lives, and they use ‚ÄúFacebook evil‚Äù as an excuse to cut everyone off.",

I understand that its all BS and a bunch of people fabricating their lives, all while giving a false sense of reality.\nSo, all day my Co-Worker kept telling me her internet wasn't working. I don't use my phone at work (only calls and text). So I asked her to text me, her text came through Blue (IPhone messenger), which wouldn't work if her internet didn't work. Made it worse was her Boyfriend/Childs father wasn't answering the phone, she was calling him to see if his internet wasn't working, but he wasn't answering. Got to tge point as to where she wanted to call her phone provider, but forgot because we where so busy.She eventually said F-it and went on about her day. Funny to me now knowing that this was the case.

Together 10 years and 8 months, and married 9 years and 8 months.\n\nI decided that I did not want children when I was none years old. My wife decided the same when she was 10 or 11 years old. (Writing this out like this I just now realized that, with the age difference between us, we essentially decided this at the same time!! Whoa!)\n\nI wanted to get a vasectomy when I was 20 years old (and would have wanted it much sooner if I had known what a vasectomy was before then) but... that clearly wasn't going to happen. But I was able to get it when I was 30 years of age, though.\n\nSide Note:\n\nI kid you not when I say this: My doctor wouldn't consider giving me a vasectomy until *AFTER* he met with and spoke with my wife. A lot of people tend to be surprised by that bit of info. I didn't have a reference point (because every guy I know that also has one has children, so their process was clearly different) so I thought this was normal. But apparently people, specifically women, are wide-eyed surprised to hear that my Urologist wouldn't even finish the conversation with me without my wife present. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nAnyways, we have always been child free, and always will be. (Before you say: \"A vasectomy can be reversed\" or \"A vasectomy can repair itself sometimes, so you never know!\" Understand that, under regular circumstances, you would be correct. But I had mine fried, or cauterized, rather. So that can't happen to me. üòÅ) \n\nMy wife and I have a healthy marriage. She is my best friend. We get along so damn well. While the pandemic, especially last year during the quarantines, made a lot of couples fuss and fight due to sharing a space for so long with each other without a break, our quarantine brought us closer. Prior to the pandemic I would work a lot of overtime for extra money, and my wife was looking into getting a second job for the same. But after spending so much time together the way we did, we both decided to nix my overtime and her diseire for a second job and to just budget better. That way, we can spend more time with each other and not get caught up on working all the damn time and being away from each other. And we have been doing that ever since.\n\nLife is good. Sometimes I think *too good.* The only thing we \"struggle\" with is finding married couples 8n our area who are also #TeamNoKids. All the couples we know (and love) are also breeders, so they have extra responsibilities and such, which we totally get.\n\nWe do not regret our decision one iota. As a matter of fact, we love our life together.",

I know its somewhat hypocritical of me saying this while using reddit, but I think FB specifically has hurt our country (united states) a lot specifically, and the world in general.\n\nIt has enabled the spread of misinformed conspiracies to such a dangerous level that people are not taking a life saving vaccine during a deadly multi year pandemic... it also helps dangerous groups of people coordinate in a way that was not foreseen when FB came out.  That's not even getting into how its completely changed the world of politics and elections.\n\nI don't know what the solution is, but I believe we need to rethink how social media works. Its a very useful tool that gives people a voice they never could have had before, but that's also the problem. its  a double edged sword and its currently out of balance in my opinion.\n\nEDIT: and before someone says it, im not advocating for censorship. I am an artist and I dont believe that is ever a good solution. But something needs to change....",

It's a breath of fresh air. No politics, no racism/sexism, just honest 'how ya been, boy!?' kinda talk. I've missed them quite a bit. \n\nThere's an option on Facebook, for those of you thinking about quitting, to download all of your pictures. I just downloaded all the photos I have onto my home PC, and I'm going to back them up onto a separate external drive, just in case. \n\nI haven't fully quit Facebook yet, but I'm easing away from it more and more.

Someone sent me a message on messenger like 3 months ago because apparently the last thing I posted on facebook is I was about to have thyroid surgery in the middle of 2020 and she thought I'd died during the surgery because I never updated post-surgery.\n\nBut I'm just wondering if all these bizarre ass theories I'm hearing have any merit or it people are just making them up because they \"sound right.\" (this is mainly on twitter, not here.)\n\nFor instance: I've heard Facebook is down while they destroy evidence for an upcoming investigation (why would they take FB down to to do that and draw this kind of attention? It makes it FAR more likely they'd be found out.) I've also heard someone inside FB intentionally sabotaged the site to \"remove it from the internet forever.\" Or, that it's a cyber-attack with the same goal as the insider theory. It's just coming from someone outside the company instead of inside.\n\nAnother theory is it's a plot by Zuckerberg to foil any more attempts at regulating/controlling/fining/etc Facebook because without it they realize how much they need it, so this is all a grand scheme by Zuckerberg to become immune any sort of ramifications for what he does.\n\nAll those fucking stupid as shit and I don't think any of them are true.

How much power does that take to shut stuff like that down, I wonder.\n\nOn a different note- I did a quick phone number search on my phone and it came back as registered to some dude M***A*** in Huntington Beach. Must be where I‚Äôm getting spammed and all this unnecessary attention.\n\nAbout 2 1/2 years ago my son Christian died. He had a heart transplant because some idiot was playing with biological garbage and created a virus that caused him to have heart failure. Endo and myocarditis, either one would‚Äôve killed a full grown man. My son had both and then got a heart from a boy who had committed suicide-\nNumerous operations later, and after a riot that broke out where he and I were the only ones who didn‚Äôt run, he finally succumbed. His name is Christian Michael Dinh-\n\nHe‚Äôs been dead just couple years now but it seems someone has stolen his name and created profiles of him. Before he died at age 21, he had graduated high school, got a DL, and I helped him build his credit score up to almost 800-\n\nAnd now some lame stole my boys identity-(I ended up hojacking it back and putting it in my name. Why? So that when they did go apply, I‚Äôd get notified. Sure enough, the greedy bastards did it just the day after. They bought a 2 million house in Sunnyvale.\n\nSo after my son died, I suffered asphyxiation because I was obliged to do a double job for single pay and it didn‚Äôt even get appreciated.\nI was gone 26 minutes.\n\nThen I stood at the bathroom sink and screamed my heart out because I needed 4‚Äù of hemorrhaging to be removed downside.\n\nAnd the following month I had another son but ended up having to leave her because of the child support and false insurance along with the hacked phone / email/ business accounts extravaganza. \n\nThen shit hit the roof. It seemed like my head was the dump site for all the evil, vile shit going on in the world and I ended up leaving-\n\nBut only I‚Äôm still here and angry as hell because damned if I do, and damned if I don‚Äôt. \n\nDoes anyone know who Trung Nguyen and Mai Thao is?\n\nAnyway- last night I created a photo album on Google photos- about 230 pics of all the jobs I did before the the BS extra‚Äôs- when I was done I hit the share button. \n\nWhy did only my attorney‚Äôs name, the HER up top, and the Thien Vuong and family of weirdos I‚Äôve never heard of in my life pop up? According to my phone they‚Äôve been blocked.And here‚Äôs the onion, I screamed at him on the phone that day to get the fuck out of my accounts- the unintentional threat was that he‚Äôd find out who i truly am. His sister already seen all the eyes on my body. Maybe they‚Äôre scales some would say. Either way, they knew better but too gainful obsessed. Guess they messed with the WRONG SON.\n\nAbout 7-8 people on my Google account which I can‚Äôt get into and APEX GRP is  a mess. \n\nI can‚Äôt call out and nobody other than spammers or con artists blow up my phone all day. \n\nNames and emails and screenshots going back damn near 2-3 years now. Never had time to look at it until after I was gone and came back-\n\nThen I told my attorney about it because the civil and restraining order was filed out of sequence- for threat of life that is‚Ä¶\nWeird how the law works. \n\nI guess justice really is BLIND-\n\nAnd let‚Äôs talk Facebook now- I believe the whisper was a data breach and then info was sold to someone at Facebook and yada, yada -\n\n6-7 data breaches later‚Ä¶.\n\nTried filing with FTC, consumer , attorney general \n\nGot replies back from a NO-REPLY@whatever \n\nSame for the debt settlement too- all apps\n\nAnd when told to counsel- shit, he went out to lunch with the other guy‚Ä¶.\nPay attention to what the Spirit says.\n\nRead the seven letters in REVelations\n\nThat‚Äôs Me.\n\nPS. If you had just asked me or placed a white paper with dotted lines to sign- that would have been the upright way. I even told them many times- \n\nBy the way- I can hear you guys.",
