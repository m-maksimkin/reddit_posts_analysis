As someone who once worked in retail, I can assure you that you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar and I absolutely went out of my way for the customers that were nice to me -- to a point where I'd even stay late trying to fix their problems because I wanted to genuinely help them and this is coming from someone who never works overtime. However, if you yelled at me, was snarky, talked down to me, etc.. I can almost guarantee you that I'd enforce company policy to a tee and ensure that it did not favor whatever you wanted me to do for you. This is the thing that people don't realize: those customer service reps are being paid to represent their company, but it's not THEM that you have a problem with, it's the company itself. They are not the company. They're just the person being hired barely anything to represent it while the executive or high-level employee that likely made the decision that is screwing you over or making you angry in the first place is hiding away in their posh corporate office.\n\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't get angry or let someone who is lying or trying to advantage of you off the hook. There have been situations where I've been firm and drop my smile against people in these positions who are either lying or being disrespectful, but I never raise my voice. It's not worth it and there's nothing to be gained from it. People around you aren't going to have any context either, they're just going to think you're some asshole screaming at some customer service rep who gets paid a borderline slave wage to deal with this bullshit on a regular basis.\n\nAll of this is basically to say: be good to people.

And if it is an issue with the individual’s handling of a problem, then you escalate it appropriately and give that feedback- you never make it personal or resort to screaming insults. I feel like people tend to treat people far worse on the phone than in person because they can’t see their face (same reason why there’s so many assholes on the internet).

(He had something gucci and I thought it was chanel, or vice vera, or SOMETHING. A brand that makes their logo a letter or a couple of letters. YSL? Idk.) It was just really offputting. And you just KNOW if I'd swooned over his 2k backpack, I'd be a golddigger just going with him for money or something. It was so uncomfortable. I was also studying abroad at the time, and for me personally, that $2k killed me. I could've backpacked for a month or two off that. Fair enough, perhaps he really liked the backpack, but it was just a strange thing to splurge that much money on. (We also weren't in a major city like Toronto.) I'm not anti-brand, and I'm also not a hippy-esque backpacker. I have Nike Airs, I just got them because I loved the colour, not the brand. It was just an awful date and he came across quite douchebaggy from the way he talked about the value of his stuff.

I didn't really see the point being friends with or even close acquaintances, because of an altercation between some of my so called friends. It's funny when I run into them now, almost 9 years later and they try to say \"we all miss you and we thought you died\". What is especially cringe worthy: they ask what happened to *you* and put all the blame of your leaving on you instead of admitting they were in the wrong. I once ran into one of these female friends in the gas station for example. It had a built in laundromat and some tables, which at the hours I was in them, they were always full of cops getting lunch. So I was walking out of the store and ran into the girl, and we happened to meet at just outside of the tabled in area. Right in front of 5 cops on duty, she asks me \"hey, anon, why have you just disappeared and did you hear what happened to so-and-so?\" She caught me so off guard but I kept my composure the whole time and just said what I honestly could, \"I didn't die, you all showed me a long time ago that I shouldn't hang out with you, let alone live together considering that you constantly tried to sleep with other guys when you dated x, and you almost never called to ask how I was okay during or after any of my past depression cycles. We lived together and you never once thought to ask if I was okay and here you are still pretending we were ever friends. I'm good now. I'm not dead, I'm very much alive and definitely in a much better place.\n\nThe cops sitting there listening to this whole thing stopped eating and talking and they all started clapping and agreeing, \"you handled that shit perfectly.\" She walked away feeling like she just realized how bad of a person she really was.

I met her once) i found out after the party that it turned out he had already told her I was gonna be there and she got excited - so he wanted me to come and basically display dominance over me or something to impress her ? \n\n\nAnyways I go to the party and just as he goes to get the drinks upstairs - the girl comes in and is immediately all over me - so when he comes back down he gets drunk and tries to heavily come onto the poor girl. \n\nHe even starts asking his mum if she can sleep in his room - the girl hasn’t spoken a word to him - she’s just physically rejected his advances. \n\nThen he takes me outside and starts telling me he’s jealous of me,  sees how she looks at me and he’s worried no one likes him, I say if she comes onto me I’m not gonna say no, sorry I guess? \n\n\nWe go back in and one of his best friends makes a joke about his weight infront of the girl and she laughs...so he literally starts a physical wrestle/fist fight with one of his supposed best friends infront of her - she gets up and asks me to go outside, we make out and then leave. \n\n\nThis guy hated me afterwards. I never said anything in class to him because I kinda felt bad but once the rest of the class found out they made fun of him any chance they got - the thing is people kept on telling him they didn’t like him or the way he spoke to people but idk he’s just laugh, put his arm around people and say he’s joking thinking he was this fuckin cool guy \n\n\nOnce we left college everyone blocked him on social media - this was about 3/4 years ago and that girl he had a crush on told me people have told her that he still brings it up",

That's like playing ball hockey on a street and expecting the cars to drive around you.  \n\np.s once I turned 30 I became a grumpy old man. Skateboarding in itself is pretty badass and cool, if it's done in respectful areas but 99% of the folks I know and see doing it never take those things into consideration.",

Of course I'd have rather my son just defended himself with action like he was being pummelled, but it didn't go that way. I will say that this who couldn't control his behavior suddenly stopped beating on my kid. \n\nMy son was suspended for a couple of days. We were called to the office and told what had happened. They also told me that he had been observed using great restraint many times. So, I shrugged and said that if the school can't defend him, then he should be allowed to defend himself. \n\nNobody really disagreed and he didn't get in trouble at home accept to be advised to use less dangerous methods of defending himself. Not sure what is less dangerous since a punch in the nose can potentially kill someone, or a body hit can cause a heart arrhythmia. \n\nMy son is grown with his own family, but I'm still back and forth on this and whether I should have dissuaded him from tusing he choke hold.",

He stopped at the restaurant and spent some time ogling the waitresses, and then tried hitting on them. None of the waitresses looked older than their early 20's, at most. One looked like she was MAYBE 18. This dude could have been their father.\n\nHe was doing all of the douchey things, like flexing his \"guns\", being extra aggro to random folks, and doing his level best to show off.

This dude regularly comes in, sits down next to a good looking girl if possible, and pulls up his long sleeves to expose a tattoo.(It is a cool looking tattoo I guess) Just hoping that someone will say \"oh cool tattoo!\" and he responds, surprised every time that someone noticed, \"what? oh this? haha thanks, let me tell you my life story\" I've probably seen this play out hundred times in the last few years.\n\nHe'll go outside to smoke or piss and the sleeves are down and reset for potential story mode every time he comes back in. I think he did it like 3-4 times in an hour when there was a bachelorette party or something, and waves of women were coming in.\n\nIt's like being a low budget David Attenborough. On one hand, I guess it kinda works sometimes and it's a harmless conversation starter. On the other, it seem like some sociopathic human baiting trap and I want to go up to him and whisper \"I know what you're doing dude and it's fuckin creepy and weird\"",

But it demonstrates a sociopathic level of being okay with making everyone else suffer (literally, considering how many people are highly noise sensitive and suffer debilitating migraines because of it, or who just want to relax after working hard) around them just so they \"feel good\".  Not sure how close that is to being down with torturing small animals for fun, but it's in the neighborhood.\n\n\"I burned down your house.
