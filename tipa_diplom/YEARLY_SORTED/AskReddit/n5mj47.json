As I understand it, the raping started when she was around 9 and didn't end until she was 16 when she told people about it.  There is a lot around this that I have a hard time processing, 20+ years after finding out I have so many things I struggle with.  For starters, how the fuck do you let that bastard stay in the family.  For the rest of his miserable life!  Hard stop.\n\nHow do you not tell your kids.  He was there all through my childhood as my grandpa, I was the only male of 6.  Never we were never told.  What if he did that to one of us!  I can only imagine how everyone else knew not to talk about it around us.  There are so many other things with this, how could anyone hang out, fish, DEFEND, this piece of shit!  Unfortunately my aunt didn't get to see him die.  She died in her early 60s a few years before my grandma who died a couple years before he finally died this year.  I hope he was fucking lonely as fuck.  \nThe thing is he had a hand in both of their deaths.  His raping of my aunt set up a life full of bad decisions and an early onset of  COPD.  Which ultimately took her on Thanksgiving, no less.  My grandma, he would tell her (I heard this from family members) that no one would show up to her funeral.  That no one cared.  Then when she fell for the last time, breaking her hip, confining her to that wheel chair for the last few months of her life, family heard her say that he pushed her.  He was no grandpa of mine.  I hope no one showed to your funeral you piece of shit.  If he'll exists I hope eternity is full of your worst fucking nightmares.",

In January 1949 my sister was born. I was born some time later.\n\nNever, ever did my Sister and I have one molecule of likeness, it seemed to us. In fact, she used to tease saying, \"You don't belong in our family. You were adopted.\"\n\nWe were opposites in Everything: She was left handed, a blonde; I was right handed, a brunette; I was flamboyant; she was pious and religious -- and obedient.  As we grew up, she was dedicated to home, hearth, marriage and tradition. I was as much like a saloon chick as I could be.\n\nLast year my sister's daughter (my niece) did the [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com) DNA thing. Oopsie!! Only mine and my sister's MATERNAL relatives matched.\n\nMy niece was completely baffled -- who ARE all of these \"Other People\" on her mother's side of the ancestry chart??\n\nWell! Well!! Evidently, after marrying MY dad, my mother had a revenge-fling to get even with an argument she had with my father.\n\nMy sister was conceived by another man -- and then my mother went silently to her grave about the chapter in her marriage that my father knew nothing about.\n\nMy niece made the arbitrary decision that no one in the family was to tell my sister of her real heritage -- whether to keep the discovery a secret or not has split the family in two with arguments and morality judgements.\n\nAlthough my niece DID contact her mother's half-siblings and her cousins who KNEW the story!  This 'secrets spilled' was only half-spilled in our family. \n\nUgh! [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com)!!!",

He would help us with car stuff all the time, would buy my whole family tickets to our city's minor league baseball team games, and season passes for our zoo for Xmas every year. He also was always super nice and loved all the kids in the family and helped take care of them... he married for a few years himself and had one son who has his own daughter and he was always great with them, but his marriage didn't work out, (for obvious reasons looking back on it now), but since he wasn't married and his kid was out of the house he moved in with my great grandmother, his mom, when she got too old to take care of herself and he lived with her and took care of her for years... she lived to be 89, and they ended up dying the same year, about 3 months apart, both from cancer. \n\nI found out he was a big time pothead when I was a teenager but we never smoked together unfortunately, and then after he died my mom let on with the whole him being gay thing... Idk it made me feel bad cuz I know he couldn't live his life the way he wanted to when he was still around, even if my family never treated him badly for it perse, it was still something most of them felt like he needed to hide about himself, which is wrong in and of itself. \n\nI know, a couple of silly things when you look at it today, but the being gay thing was a secret that sort of controlled and in a way ruined his life and I was still shocked to hear it when I did, even if it made sense later on as I was an adult. I wish I would have known when he was alive, so I could have told him that I didn't mind, that I still loved him and accepted him for whoever he wanted to be, but unfortunately life doesn't work that way. Oh well, Uncle Dan I know is living it up in his own afterlife in his weed garden, getting high and blowing guys or whatever... sorry if that sounds graphic but hey, it's what he would have wanted damnit!",

Our parents played it off and by our late teens we gave it up. 20+ years later I get a friend request from a woman in TX. At the time I was a low key craft personality on YouTube, she was into knitting so I figured she saw my tutorials, so I accepted. \n\nThe next day I get a message from her explaining that her stepfather was my biological father as well as my brother‚Äôs. Her story checked out and when I saw his picture I knew she was telling the truth. \n\nI told no one in my family for a year and a half. I couldn‚Äôt look them in the eye, or anyone of my relatives for that matter because they were all in on it.\n\nTurns out my mother was married to the dude and divorced him a year after I was born, quickly met my dad, unless there had already been some infidelity happening, I don‚Äôt know, and married him six months later. My brother was two years older, and he was more adamant as a child about it because he was 3-4 when it all went down. \n\nWhen I finally decided to let the cat out of the bag, I booked a trip to meet him and set off to my parents house alone to have dinner and tell them. I told the woman that I would be coming by myself, because my brother was fragile and he may have a very different response than mine. \n\nSo I confront my parents after dinner and of course I‚Äôm the asshole and my now adopted father says ‚Äòthe only person hurting from this is your mother because I just stabbed her in the back‚Äô. I was expecting that and didn‚Äôt take it to heart because I had just dropped the bomb on them and they had thought they were in the clear for good. \n\nThe next day my mother convinces me that it‚Äôs not fair to go alone and that I should cancel the trip same book it with my brother.

He was a very Midwest rural type, who was insecure to the max, and quite abrasive. With equal empathy, compassion, and romanticism of a hyena. A few years later after he decided that there was no one he could trust he ate a bullet, leaving behind two young children and an evil to the core ex wife. \n\nFucked up shit, but honestly I think he‚Äôs better off now, because had he made it this far he would be suffering from a clinical case of q-anon-osis. \n\nTen years later I still haven‚Äôt met the man.",

He then put the gun to his head, squeezed the trigger, and collapsed behind a couch. They all thought it was some sort of sick joke at first, until they looked over the couch and saw his body and the blood.\n\nI first heard this story from my mom when I was 18, which explained some of my dad's behavior towards toy guns when I was a kid, but I never brought it up to him. I just hoped that one day he would open up to me about and eventually he did, but we haven't talked about it since then. \n\nI'm amazed how my dad dad turned out to be such a great man having to expeience something awful like that at such a young age, but according to him it's something that never left him either. He still has nightmares about it and get really uneasy in movies and TV shows when they show someone getting shot in the head.",

He has many quirks, and in the 90‚Äôs as I grew up people didn‚Äôt have words to describe to me why how was different. It was known that he had epilepsy, a fairly short temper, and an incredibly literal take on things. He is, in short, a hard man to know at times. \n\nIt was only in the last decade have we begun to unravel his story. \n\nDue to living in the South Island without a lot of money, we didn‚Äôt see our extended family much growing up, so there wasn‚Äôt much of an opportunity to ask questions as I became a teenager. \n\nOriginally, it was claimed that dad had been out in the sun too long as a child and had serious sun stroke that triggered a change in him. Before that time, he‚Äôs been a fairly normal child. But over the years, another story came out: dad had dived into a swimming pool and hit his head hard, causing a change. \n\nBut finally, about a decade ago, after my step-grandmother passed, the truth floated to the surface. \n\nMy grandfather was a man deeply affected by WWII. He had served in the infantry in Egypt, and the experience changed him. My memories of him are of a jolly man with a temper when he was pushed, growing grumpier each time I saw him. Anyway, he had returned from the war an angry man, working as a labourer best I can tell, marrying my grandmother, who passed when my dad was 12. When my dad was a teenager, after years of tough upbringing, did something that made my grandfather snap - dad has always been a smart-ass, and knows how to needle people. \nIn response, my grandfather beat the shit out of him.

When my next appointment came up he was really quiet for a bit before  verbally stumbling about... It turns out that what was happening with my teeth was a classic sign of inbreeding and he was super uncomfortable giving me the news. I brought it up to my mom and she just was like: \"Oh well yeah, didn't you know?\" WTF!? of course I didn't know!!! Turns out that not very far back in the family tree, several of my relatives decided that it was a good idea to get married to one another....and no one bothered to mention it...ever. The small town where I live is 85% my relatives, no joke. I hadn't even met all of them, that's how many there are.  \n Edited for clarification: \nI had made a big point of going far away from my hometown to meet my husband ( married 12 years this june)  because I was afraid of having children with someone that might be my cousin. Only to find out 5 years after we had been married that I was in fact a product of inbreeding. My husband and I are not related at all.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**   \nI did not expect this to blow up, I honestly thought that It would just get lost.   \nThank you for the awards!  \n ***I will try to answer some questions here....***  \n \\- my teeth look normal. nothing special about them, no crowding, nicely spaced. Pretty normal teeth.  I didn't take what the dentist said really all that seriously and figured that what the proff said was maybe just a theory rather than fact. Maybe just correlation rather than causation. Then I told my mom....  \n\\- All of my lower incisors have split roots with split nerves. The nerves are in a V shape instead of just straight. There are cavities in my chin around the nerves, so if I get a slight bump on the chin the inflammation can cause an infection...I pretty much end up looking like a sexy female version of  Brian Mulroney !   \n\\- I found out about this after I had been married for around 5 years.   \n\\- I am from Ontario Canada. I won't say where because you might be my cousin.   \n\\- both my mother's side and my father's side came from small towns where the population was predominantly family. i.e. the families had lived there since the town had been settled. So there is a good chance that there had been some inter cousin shenanigan's on both sides, though no names from my mothers side showed up in my fathers family tree.    \n\\- so far 23andme says that  I have a little over 1500 relatives scattered  across Canada and the USA and only 17 in the UK.

I was about 12 at the time. I remember feeling scared because I could hear my mom crying, but she didn‚Äôt want to see anybody or talk about why she was crying. \n\nOn an evening later that week, my parents sat each of us kids down and told us about my mom‚Äôs past and explained that my half-brother had reached out to my mom wanting to meet her and get to know her. My dad had known ever since he and mom were dating in college, and I believe my oldest sister had been told  previous to this point.

            "text": "When I was 28, I found out that my dad was not my biological father. The news came out via the following: my dad was battling depression and was suicidal, so I had just flown home to try to take care of him and rescue him from my mom's wrath. My mom had verbally and emotionally abused him during their entire relationship. He loved her so much, and he tolerated it.\n\nWell, during a solemn walk w/ my dad, as I tried to help him out, he confided that he's not my biological dad, and he went on to tell me he knew this all along but my mom lied to him and tried to convince him that he was my biological father. He knew he wasn't, but he wanted to play the role. When I was 10 years old, my mom finally confessed this to him, and he was worried that upon hearing the news, officially, he'd somehow let this affect his relationship with me. So, when I was 28 years old, during this walk w/ my dad, as he pours out this story to me, he frames it by telling me that his two most proud items in his life are: (1) how I turned out / his raising me; (2) that he had completely forgot about the news my mom told him earlier in that day (when I was 10), about him not being my biological father, and that it was only upon tucking me in at night (when I was 10), that it briefly crossed his mind. It was at that point that he knew nothing would ever come between us and our father-son relationship would be as awesome as ever.\n\nHe also confided that my mom did hard drugs while pregnant with me, and this broke his heart to witness firsthand. They were very poor. My dad grew up in a foster home without parents. My mom grew up w/ 6 siblings and ill-equipped parents. She dropped out of 9th grade, whereas all of her other siblings dropped out earlier -- many of them are barely literate.\n\nI'm now mid-30s, and tragically, my dad committed suicide mid-March 2020, right as COVID was hitting. I was out of the country at the time but immediately flew 30 hours (30-min layover) and made it in time for his funeral. I do everything in his honor.\n\n**[UPDATE:]**\nWow, this thread blew up overnight! My most popular comment by 2 orders of magnitude, and it's about my sorrow. I'm just glad so many of you read about how amazing my dad was, and I truly appreciate the outpour of kind, thoughtful words and wishes. It warms my heart. I could go on and on with countless examples about how amazing he was. After graduating from the orphanage at age 18, he moved up to Atlanta by himself and taught himself woodworking. He was incredible and would build fine-furniture pieces for renowned interior decorators, and his items would be in magazines all the time. He was a starving artist -- we always struggled to get by. Yet, I felt like a spoiled kid on my street, as I had life easier than everyone else (the other kids on my street lived in trailer-homes and had very chaotic households), and it was clear that both of my parents loved me immensely and I felt very well-provided for and supported.\n\nI was very lucky to have him in my life. I still think about him daily, and I'm trying to improve emotionally.\n\nI appreciate everyone sharing your own similar stories, and it provides a sense of camaraderie. Hearing the shared pain and empathy, and seeing that this resonated with so many people, it motivates me to finally write a Short Stories book that would include snippets from my relationship with him. For those interested in reading more about him:\n\n**[EXERPT FROM MY EULOGY TO HIM, WHICH I WROTE WHEN FLYING TO HIS FUNERAL]**\n\n**2. His hard work**\nFor my entire upbringing, he worked every single day in his shop, for long hours ‚Äì didn‚Äôt even take a day off for Christmas or his birthday. As a kid, I witnessed his work ethic and it forever left an impression on me. Importantly, he didn‚Äôt appear as if he was working for someone else; he was working for himself. He found what he loved ‚Äì woodworking ‚Äì and he completely immersed himself into and dedicated his life to making perfectly crafted items because he wanted to. He had passion, a pursuit of perfection, and an unlimited tank of dedication to fuel it. He didn‚Äôt just make items. He didn‚Äôt just work. He made masterpieces. \n\nWhen I was 18 and left home to go to college, I aspired to be like my dad. He set the example. I was trying to make something of myself, and to really give it my all just like he did. His work ethic was ingrained in me. I would get 4-5 hours of sleep many nights every week. For years. It was hard, but I always thought about how much harder my dad worked. I would recall memories of him working in his shop late at night: I‚Äôd hear the saws spinning; The compressor running; memories of huge sawdust piles under his table-saw. He did so much to provide for our family. He always provided. I remember being a kid, hanging out with him in his shop, admiring his dedication to the craft and strive for perfection.\n\nSo, when I was 18, starting college, I was trying to make him proud, and I was also trying to do everything I could so that I‚Äôd have the opportunity to do anything I want in this world. Not just for myself, but on behalf of my dad. A part of me felt that whatever opportunity I gained, whatever success I had, it was in hopes that he too would somehow benefit. That he could vicariously get what he deserved. He deserved the world, and I‚Äôve just been trying to channel his hard work and do my part. Anything I‚Äôve accomplished, it‚Äôs because of my dad.\n\n**3. His creative problem solving abilities**\nNot only did my dad work relentlessly hard, but he masterfully found creative solutions to everything. He truly dedicated his life to solving problems and designing furniture for others. There is no physical item he could not figure out. His ability to do so was way beyond anything I‚Äôve ever witnessed. None of my colleagues at MIT, Harvard, Brown, or whatever fancy place I've worked at could remotely come close to having my dad‚Äôs unique ability to creatively make things work. Whatever the problem, my dad could find a solution.\n\nWhen he was 12, he was excited once he learned that you could repair some radios just by replacing the diodes. When I was a kid, he made me an incredible tree house with its own electricity line. When I was a teenager, there was a large ice storm in Georgia that caused half a million homes to lose power for up to a week, our house included. My dad had an old portable black and white TV. He grabbed his car battery, and rigged it up so that we could watch TV for days, despite not having power. His vehicles over the years had so many contraptions and workarounds, they were often like modern day Flintstones cars. This was how he did things his entire life.\n\n**5. His strength and character**\nHis perseverance was unmatched. He handled so much adversity over the years, especially the past 10 years when he was in so much pain. He was the strongest person I‚Äôve ever met. Hands down. In recent years, he experienced and recovered from Stevens-Johnsons syndrome, a rare, horrific, deadly skin disorder that covers the entire body. He was resilient beyond belief, and he endured so many personal obstacles that were thrown his way. His strength wasn‚Äôt just in his ability to endure, but in his bravery. I have many stories from my childhood where he stepped us to save the day in crises. He was fearless. Not only was he courageous in his character, but he was also physically strong as an ox. It was uncanny. In his 60s, he could often lift more than I could in my 30s, despite my being really into weightlifting, but I‚Äôll spare you the fun, humbling details.\n\n**6. Vulnerability and gentleness**\nOnce I became an adult, he was strong enough to admit to me tough moments in his life. He was willing to confide in me painful times that he endured. He was willing to call on me for help, and to tell me when he felt he wasn‚Äôt strong enough. We all feel this way at times. He was vulnerable to cry. He showed me that one‚Äôs willingness to show vulnerability is in fact a product of strength and bravery.\n\n**11. Closing**\nAs I close, I want to mention one of my favorite artists, Alanis Morissette, who has a stanza that challenges us by asking: ‚ÄúHow ‚Äôbout remembering your divinity? How ‚Äôbout unabashedly bawling your eyes out? How ‚Äôbout not equating death with stopping?‚Äù To this effect, I know that my dad will continue to inspire me and influence me for the rest of my life, without question.\n\nI am who I am because of him. I‚Äôve always aspired to uphold the principles and he stood for. And I hope that others see in me his virtues and pieces of his personality. I want to continue his legacy. Thus, he hasn‚Äôt ‚Äôstopped.‚Äô Further, I challenge all of you to do the same in never equate death with stopping. That is, we can do better than just remembering someone; we can do better than just remembering my dad. We can continue to learn from what he‚Äôs taught us, the elements I‚Äôve mentioned today:\n\n1. When you find something you love, whether it‚Äôs work or a hobby, put everything you have\ninto it.\n\n2. Be willing to think creatively to solve problems.\n\n3. Take the time to enjoy the so-called minutia in life. the alleged trivial details. make it\nsignificant.\n\n4. Be willing to play and be silly; don‚Äôt take yourself too seriously.\n\n5. Be brave. Be strong. Be so strong, that you‚Äôre willing to be vulnerable.\n\n6. Be a teacher, and be a lifelong student.\n\n7. Mean everything you say and speak earnestly.\n\n8.

My uncle's troop found a family to raise the baby, and that's the story the whole family knows.\n\nThe secret is that my uncle and some other guys from his troop stayed in contact with the family and the kid, sending them money every month to help raise him and then to help him go to university and eventually helped him and his adoptive family move to Australia in the last 90s.

Absolutely nobody was sad about it; my dad only kept in contact with him because he felt he had to. I didn't have to go to the funeral, happily, but when my dad came back he said he should've guessed the old man would be VERY specific in his will about what was to be done with his body (grave, coffin etc.).   \n\n\nTurns out, my great-grandfather's mother (so grandad's dad's mum) had a mental break and couldn't look after my great-grandfather when he was a kid, so he was raised by her two sisters, my grandad's great aunts. My great-grandad was a fairly wealthy man, he was a successful fruit salesman at Covent Garden, and my grandad was his only child - my great-grandfather ended up predeceasing the great aunts, and all the money went to my grandad. When the great aunts died - these women who had RAISED my great-grandad, and by all accounts absolutely adored my grandad - this POS decided to save money - despite the fact that he had recently inherited a significant amount of money from his father, who definitely would've wanted them properly taken care of - and have them buried in a pauper's grave. Aka, their bodies were placed in a mass grave, without a marker, so he could save a couple hundred pounds. Apparently his justification was that they were dead, so it didn't make any difference to them.  \n\n\nFunnily enough, it seems to have mattered to him enough to specify in his will that the same was *not* to happen to him. I still get angry thinking about it. There's no way of tracking down their remains or ever giving them proper graves, as the records simply weren't kept. I strongly disliked him when he was alive, having gotten the rough shapes of my dad's terrible childhood, and I fucking hate him now he's dead. My dad's a better person than I am, because if my father had treated me the way he treated him, I would've cut off all contact as soon as possible.  \n\n\nSo, not exactly a secret, but something that was kept secret from me until the old man was dead probably partly by accident, and partly because my parents knew I wouldn't be civil to him if I'd known the full extent of just how much of a shithead he truly was.",

She pretended that those two children were that of her husband despite them not looking anything like him.\n\nHow we found out was rather interesting. A couple years ago I had gotten one of the 23andMe DNA kits to figure out what my ethnic background looked like. My aunt and uncle had done the same about a year ago as well. Once you get your results from 23andMe, it also will show you any DNA matches you have with relatives.\n\nA couple days after Christmas, a woman had reached out to my aunt and uncle asking to speak with them because 23andMe was telling her that they were her half siblings and that I was showing up as her nephew. Coming from a very strict Catholic family, this was very confusing and concerning to her. They ended up meeting and pieced together everything and then approached their parents about it who at first denied it, then came clean about the affair. \n\nIt's been pretty hard on the family. For the longest time my grandfather was too stubborn to even apologize to the family and my grandmother for all the pain he's brought, but he finally did.

My dad witnessed Sara's husband hit Sara and the baby one time, got into a physical fight with him and threw him out of the house. \n\nFor the next year of her life Sara was moving constantly to different family members homes across the country with her baby, fleeing her abusive husband.

I'm talking plywood walls, ropes and pulley systems, bean bags. We even ran an extension cord from his garage for a small TV. My family had one VCR at the time, and I would unhook it without anyone knowing for the day, sneak it outside to plug it in at the tree house to watch Tiny Toons Summer Vacation and then I'd bring it back in before anyone got home from work. One time, the damn thing fell out of the tree and broke. So I buried it under my neighbor's deck and never told a soul. For years, everyone kept blaming everyone else for its disappearance. One sibling thought the other took it when they went to college. The other one thought they took it when they had moved out. This went on for at least 15 years.

He still told everyone at work I was his child. When my dad wanted mum to divorce so they could marry and I would be his \"legitimate\" daughter, her first husband killed himself instead of \"dying in a car crash\" like my mum always told everyone. \n\nThen she told me my big old grandpa who always looked like Santa Clause and gave me candy on christmas was actually a criminal (whose father was also in jail for murdering someone until he died) and had robbed a bank in his youth, cheated on my grandma, after their divorce was engaged to a woman and at the same time cheated on her, my mum and aunt have a disabled half brother from one of his affairs... and he got into a fist fight with a policeman after he fled hospital after heart surgery, he had bad dementia.. at the age of 80.\nHonestly, up until my mum told me this, I thought he was Santa.\n\nMy grandma had a lot of mental health issues and tried to kill herself 30 years ago. Her mum died during the war and her dad remarried. It's a cinderella story without the happy ending, she was the bad step child, they took all the money her late mum inheritedy which was a lot and my grandma didn't see anything from it. She almost drowned in a bomb crater filled with rain water as a child and some of the soldiers in town just laughed at her until she was saved by a cousin. When she wanted to marry an older man who loved her dearly (and was the first person to ever love her), her dad and step mum declined and forbid them to marry. She then went into 2 unhappy marriages in poverty. I never knew about all of this because she is the kindest person on earth. Antidepressants and other meds doctors just gave her and tested on her made her brain really mushy and she can't do anything on her own anymore, but she is the kindest soul on this planet. I never knew her story until recently.\n\nMy aunt always tried to have the perfect family and never told her children about all of this, but my mum told me. After my older cousin told me that Santa and the easter bunny and the tooth fairy weren't real when I was a kid, I had a lot of fun telling them the truth about their perfect family. It was the most perfect act of revenge.\n\nAlso my dad got raped and mistreated as a child, is the illegitinate son of some noble person, his step father broke his arm and he had a lot of mental health issues he never talked about until he died last year. Mum never told me until this year. No wonder he was an alcoholic.\n\nCovid and lockdown really brought some stories to the table...",

She's just super awkward to be around and I can't really trust her, so i minimize contact and am just kind of polite and distant when it's necessary. I can't really tell her anything she can use against me because trust is broken and she's betrayed my trust before when i trusted her with information that i didn't have to.  \n\n\nOddly enough my older sister is -thrilled- that she has an older half sister and they talk on facebook.

Couldnt stand them. Basically, they had 3 kids, 2 boys (dad (youngest) and uncle (oldest)) and girl (aunt (middle)). All of their children went on to have children of their own with multiple father/mother combinations (so combinations of step and biological kids, and multiple partners having their biological kids). Neither of them were ‚Äòpure‚Äô bloodline families of 1 marriage.\n\nAunt had the first grandchild of the generation, a daughter who was loved, as ‚Äòthe first‚Äô, then aunt had a boy second who was never liked as much. Uncle married a woman who already had a daughter the same age as ‚Äòthe second‚Äô, who was hated by grandparents. Then dad (technically my stepdad) married my mum and i was brought into the family (4th in the age time line) and also hated by the grandparents. \n\nNext to come along in the succession of grand children was my brother (5th), the first biological child of my dad. And also, as we would all later discover had great significance to the grandparents, the first male grandchild to carry the family name. He was the ‚Äògolden grandson‚Äô. The only one who truly mattered. Spoiled with attention, gifts, praise, you name it. \n\nTheir children went on to produce a combined, 1 more grand child not with their family name, 3 grand daughters with the family name and 1 more grand son with the family name (my second brother born immediately after my first brother). None of whom were as special as the golden grand child, but who were treated equally as 3rd place (behind ‚Äògolden grandson‚Äô and ‚Äòthe first‚Äô). Neither truly loved nor hated by the grand parents. But they were liked. \n\nThey never really hid how they felt, but it was also never spoken about and just sort of accepted. It wasn‚Äôt until my dad died that it all really came out. I was disowned by the family, and they cut contact with my 2 younger siblings. Did everything they could to maintain my brother ‚Äòthe golden grandson‚Äô on a pedestal. \n\nThe best part is, he cut contact with them for how they treated his siblings after dad passed (we were only teenagers and all very close) and changed his name! He took my mums maiden surname and passed that onto his kids. \n\nIts been 8 years since dad passed and from what I understand, they eventually gave up on ‚Äògolden grandson‚Äô and turned their attention to my second brother who is now the only one of us to maintains contact with them at all, and the  only one of us who still has the oh-so-important family name (uncle never had any sons to carry the family name). He is also genetically sterile due to a child hood accident. But i really dont care any more. I shut out any feelings i had about how they treated me years ago. They were just mean old assholes. It wasn‚Äôt even some important family. Just a lower class, barely living above poverty, family from the boonies. \n\nSo tldr, grandparents didnt care about (even openly disliked some of) the grand kids who would not pass on the family name to their own children. And it came back to bite them in the ass, because their family name will die with their sons.",

I started seeing the system in which the old book of laws and numbers teach a system to \"get a long with your neighbor\" except I saw the corruption that western thinking leads to. I was a full blown anti semite. Then I found out when my grandfather died that he saved more Jews than Schindler. No one knew this until a Jew reached out to us when he found out. These Jews in masses wanted to thank him. He went on the news and everything. He was made a righteous among the nations in Israel and he traveled for a few years so it was hard for me to ask him what it was like. I got to see him on his death bed. He saved 3,500 by himself and 5000 with the help of Franco's Spain. I still believe that fascism in it's purest state is achievable but now I don't call my self a fascist or an anti fascist. The things my grandfather went through made me be an anti-nazi and anti bigot.

The wife from one and the husband from another had an affair. My partner was the product of said affair. The affair did not break up either marriage, and as far as I am aware the man's wife never even found out about the affair. The man who my partner thought was his dad probably but maybe didn't know his son was not biologically his child. This was told to my partner when he was 23~iirc.\n\nI think it is likely the man who my partner thought was his father did know he wasn't the father. I say this just because my partner said his dad very clearly favored his daughter (my partner's younger half sister) over him. So maybe he knew, forgave his wife, and just lived his life as though it never happened. I don't know. It seems to me it would be difficult to forgive your wife for having an affair and having a child with another man. But it is nice that he did end up being more or less chill about it, either way.\n\nIt is unclear whether his bio dad knew about my partner being his son or not. When my partner connected with his half-siblings, they didn't mention his existence to their dad just because it could be stressful for him and he was in poor health. So, he has never met his bio dad. The man who he thought was his dad growing up died quite a few years ago, and the guy his mom married after that had just recently died (or maybe at that time he had just been diagnosed with cancer).

Based upon patterns, the father of both kids, my uncle, was likely unable to parent anyone since he experienced lifelong psychological torment by his sister, and likely was psychologically killed by his sister' s theft of his child.\n\nHis sister (my mother) was married to an extremely wealthy 1% man, which rendered  her brother (my uncle) incapable of fighting, for his kidnapped child my uncle says ...\n\nI'm unsure of the truth, since both of his kids were technically relinquished.\n\nAnd there's more surrounding to the death of my 1% father ....",

He was over a foot taller than everyone in his family with straight pitch black hair, a hairless slim build and the complete inability to grow a mustache... (Another Navajo baby in New Mexico with a curly haired bearded Mexican \"dad\" ) this really fucked up my dad who had major issues his entire short life.\n\nMy cousin was raised as my aunt's daughter when she actually was my aunt's granddaughter.\n\nMy other cousin was raised by my grandparents for the first few years of his life, and then raised as my aunt and uncle's son when he was conceived before they were married and while my aunt was in college with another guy.\n\nTwo of my cousins are married and have multiple children together.\n\nTwo of my uncle's did something so bad (sexually I think... possibly prostitution) in south America in the 80's that my other uncle completely won't talk to them or about them even after one has died. (I think they were paying for child prostitutes but nobody ever fully answers the question beyond my uncle's son who I don't know if he actually knows.)\n\nMy dad was in a severe accident when I was an infant and drove his car off a cliff and was left with major facial scars... He was apparently drunk.\n\nMy dad was in a major motorcycle accident and again road rashed his face... He was drunk but again didn't get a DUI.\n\nMy dad abused my brother so bad that he ran away at 16 and never moved back.\n\nMy mom apparently stole something from my brother after my parents got a divorce that also contributed to him running away. Later when I was a teenager my mom bought him a $5000 solid gold bracelet as repayment. I still don't fully know what happened there.\n\nMy little cousin tried to kill herself and was hyper sexual (like fully flirting with adult men) as a 10 year old and ended up in a facility for a little while.\n\nI was a gay kid raised in an evangelical household with a codependent mother, an alcoholic father and abusive stepfather, with PTSD from vietnam) that left me with a dozen+ scars, burns and countless bruises over the 7 years he was married to my mom.\n\nThis is just the big shit I know of... I can't imagine what's never come to light.\n\nEdit:\n\nJust to update on current status of people...\n\nCousin that was raised as aunts daughter but was actually her granddaughter died of an overdose on a cruise ship a few years ago...\n\nHer sister mom has multiple children that she hasn't raised including a son that is being raised by her actual younger sister.\n\nSame cousin who is rasing her sisters son had her son murdered by her boyfriend when he was an infant.\n\nCousin that was raised by grandparents and then by his mom and \"dad\" has kids of his own and is doing just fine.\n\nCousins that are married have multiple kids and i think at least one gandkid by now and they're still married and one of the very few family members that didn't get divorced. My husband and I are also part of that club... So the gay kid and his kissing cousins marriages are two of the healthiest marriages in the family... Lol\n\nMy brother became a cop had kids and is now partially handicap after being crushed in his cruiser by a teen girl texting while driving. \n\nNot sure what has happened happened to my little cousin who hurt herself\n\nDad died of brain cancer that stemmed from lung cancer...

Grandma didn't die mysteriously, she committed suicide after a long battle with depression and received no help because of shitty Christian values, my favorite of which being \"If you're struggling then God has abandoned you and you need to repent in order for him to love you again and then you will feel better\".\n\n2. My \"uncle\" (actually a distant cousin who married into the family but is old enough to be my grandpa) is a pedophile and abused his youngest son after the oldest \"fought him off\". The oldest son did a lot of victim blaming and threatened my mom for being a support system to the victim and his family (they were adults by the time this came out). The victim is now an advocate for male sexual abuse survivors, especially in Christian circles, and has a loving family and support system and is doing very well.\n\n3. The family asshole is a confirmed asshole. News of his affair broke and with it all of the shitty things he has ever done. He also outed himself as an abuser during this time. It was one of those situations where you know something is wrong, but you don't know what exactly. Now we all know in gratuitous detail exactly what was/is wrong. Fuck you Joel.\n\n4. A different \"uncle\" (biological distant cousin who is old enough to be my grandpa) is gay and that was the main \"secret\" for a very long time, which I believed, for a time, was why he was ostracized from the family. Turns out it's actually because he was caught having an affair with a student (he was a professor at a Christian college) and turned into a major asshole to his wife and children after that came out. He was ostracized because the family decided to protect the wife and kids from his shitty behavior, not because he's gay (although I believe that was a factor for a while regardless of whether anyone wants to acknowledge that). Things are much better with him now and he attends family events with his partner, but his children largely don't speak to him, due to a lot of abuse in the home and loads of internalized homophobia, and his ex-wife is always more welcome and protected because even today he is unnecessarily a dick to her. By accounts from the kids she was always a good person to him and is accepting of his sexuality and partner so the vitriol seems unfounded but who knows honestly.\n\n5. My dad was an ex con whole stole a bunch of money. That's not the secret though. The secret was he continued to inappropriately handle finances for the remainder of his life which left me and my mom to deal with unknown and extreme financial situations after his death. Turns out he owed a lot of people money who were adamant about getting repayment, and took out loans in my name that I had no knowledge of. He was stashing parts of his paycheck aside to \"take care of\" these things without anyone's knowledge which doesn't work out when you no longer make a paycheck.

My dad did say some things like\n\n\n1) his biological father was *not* my grandmother's husband (still not totally sure how she figured out which of her kids were whose, but her youngest [that would be my dad] and her oldest [that is, the oldest one she got to raise, my uncle, 20 years older than my father] were at least absolutely the same man's)\n\n2) his father was also married (twice according to records, neither time to his mother, and the second occurred during the twenty year timeline between gran's oldest and youngest. The first one I'll get to in a minute)\n\n3) there was a sizeable age difference between them, though my father didn't know how much (implicitly, dad thought this is why they never married because their lives were out of sync but they kept up... the affair? Not sure what to call it; you'll see why)\n\n\nSo armed with this knowledge and some names, after my father passed, I start digging around family search (aka the free mormon resources that ancestry.com makes you pay for), and uh... The age difference between my grandparents was 18 years. Okay, times were different, moving on... I also find out my grandmother started having children very young. Like, her first baby was at 13 kind of young and she had five children before her supposed oldest (who she had at 21). It's weird; they're noted on records with a birth *year* but no birth *date*, so either they were stillborn (despite no death dates at all, suggesting they might have lived) or \"adopted out\" (in quotes because this was the late 1910s and early 1920s and the adoption system as we know it today didn't exist then, so who knows what happened given to neighbors/family/random stranger? An arrangement with what rudimentary agencies existed then? An unwed mothers home type deal? Your guess is as good as mine). \n\nBut all the babies starting from her first at 13 up to the one before her \"oldest\" all have the same father. No prizes for guessing it's my biological granddad, who was very much married at the time to someone who, from the last name, is somehow related to my grandmother. So basically, my father was the product of a child grooming situation starting when his mom was 12/13 and his father was 30/31 that continued for most of her life. Not really sure what to make of that.\n\n(Bonus fuckery: starting from her \"oldest\" until my dad was born, all the birth certificates [the originals, at least; my oldest uncle had his amended later] have her husband's name in the father's place, but then my dad's certificate has his proper biological father [though he *was* given each man's middle name for his given name, though one of those has been rendered in so many different spellings I couldn't tell you what the original was]. Since everyone, or near everyone, involved is dead, I'll likely never get a large chunk of answers about any of this.)",

She had no children.... or so we all thought.\n\nJane became pregnant by her first husband before their trip to Africa.  He refused to give up the trip to stay home with her, and refused to allow her to travel while pregnant or to give birth in Africa... so he made her stay home until she gave birth in secret, and then made her give the baby up for adoption and join him in Africa to play the part of the perfect wife to a perfect \"man of God\" without being \"burdened\" by a baby.  He dropped dead of an aneurism after a year in the Congo, and she returned home to grieve for her child in private, since she wasn't allowed to tell anyone in her life that she was even pregnant.\n\nLater, she married her second husband, who eventually passed as well, and ended up living with my grandparents.  One day, Jane gets a phone call from the now grown daughter she put up for adoption, who wants to meet her bio-parents.  Jane has never told another soul about the baby, even her own brother (my grandfather).  She tells my grandmother the whole story, begging her not to tell my grandfather or anyone else, and asks my grandmother to drive her to meet her daughter, since Jane no longer drove after having a stroke.  \n\nMy grandmother drove Jane to a truck stop halfway between their home and the daughter's home, about 3 hours away.  There was a meet, a hug, and one photo taken of the three women together.  At the end of the meeting, the daughter requested a medical history for her family but did not want to maintain further contact, and my great aunt passed away a few years later.   My grandmother kept her secret until after Jane's death, when she told my grandfather and my mother what had happened, from the abuse to the adoption and so on.  The picture was found in a box in my great-aunt's things, in a lovely frame, but had never been publicly displayed.\n\nI only found out because I was scanning and digitizing a TON of family photos from my grandmother, and I found the picture from that day, still in its frame.  I called my grandmother to ask who the third person in the picture was, since she didn't appear in any other pictures from that branch of the family.   My grandmother told me, \"Well, you ARE the oldest grandchild, I suppose I can let you in on the secret...\"  I was GOBSMACKED.  I didn't know Jane was married before the man I thought was her only husband.  She doted on all of us kids as if we were her own.  Thinking back on it, she was very careful to say \"Richard and I were never blessed with children, but we love our nieces and nephews\" when asked if she had any kids.  \n\nI would have understood more if she'd gotten pregnant out of wedlock, since that was socially more problematic in the 1930s and 1940s... but she was MARRIED and her HUSBAND, the FATHER of her child, made her give the baby away and kept her from sharing her pain with anyone.  I hate him for doing that to her.  Honestly, I know the death certificate says \"aneurism\" but I really hope she killed him.  He would have deserved it.\n\nTLDR: My grandfather's sister had a secret baby that she gave up for adoption, which nobody knew about except for my grandmother.",

My Grandpa was Canadian, his Dad died in World War 2, so he was raised by his Grandfather until he was 11 when his Grandfather died, then was adopted by his Mother's husband, who was American, and moved to The USA. His Stepdad was an abusive prick, and my Grandfather had a lot of pent up anger from that. As such, he used to get into a lot of fights, and one time, damn near beat a man to near-death. He took the man to the hospital, claiming he'd stumbled upon the man lying in the street. The man suffered amnesia, and couldn't remember that it was my Grandfather who did that to him. My Grandpa claimed he was praised as an upstanding citizen for rushing him to the hospital, and he quickly left town after that, unable to handle the guilt. The man, thankfully, survived, but had minor brain damage. Soon after, he met my Grandmother, who was also a Canadian expat living in the USA. They eventually moved back to Canada, uprooting their three children due to their belief that my Grandmother could get better healthcare in Canada than the USA due to her diagnosis of MS. My Grandpa told me this story over 10 years ago, after his wife passed, but never told his own children, for fear they'd think less of him. He claimed that, besides his wife, I was the only other person whom he ever told it to, because he saw so much of himself in me, the good and the bad, and wanted me to know I wasn't alone in my struggles with anger and resentment with the world at large. It only came out after my Grandpa died last year, when my Aunt found his memoirs on his computer while trying to find pictures for his funeral. In them he confessed to the truth, and that the only living person who knew was me. She's a cop, and she practically interrogated me about it, asking why I never told anyone in the family. I told her that my Grandfather was ashamed of what he did, and that he never wanted his children to know that their Dad was anything but a good, loving man. My Mom couldn't believe that he'd kept it from her and her siblings, and was even more shocked that I'd been able to keep it to myself for as long as I did.",

She gave birth to my half-aunt.\n\nMy grandmother‚Äôs adopted parents (my great-grandparents both died as a result of TB when she and her siblings were very young) were very cruel to her throughout her life because she wasn‚Äôt one of their biological children. They forced her to give my half-aunt up to a family who was struggling to have children, but they lived only just down the street, so she spent her life longing for what she couldn‚Äôt have, even though she had her other children in front of her. She was quite depressed, but she kept going. My grandfather was great about it all. She told him when he proposed and he loved her so much that it didn‚Äôt matter. He even moved into her house so that she could still see her daughter grow up, even though it probably wasn‚Äôt the best idea for her mental health.

Nothing weird about that.\n\nWhen I was around 20 we met my moms biological dad who she had never met... except she found out she HAD because he had tried to meet her once and my grandpa drove him off and wouldn't explain to my mom what was going on (she was around 13). He lived on the other side of the country (Quebec) while were in BC so she never got a chance until he reached out when she was an adult. My grandma has repressed a lot of what had happened and so we learned a lot of stuff we never knew. Turns out she got pregnant, ran away with him, and then her sister came and dragged her back and forced her to write a letter saying not to come after her. \n\nAnd then there's the time I found out my mom was kidnapped as an infant... the woman babysitting her just decided she wanted to keep her one day.\n\nThat's only a small sampling and only from one side... my dad's side is equally crazy, the crown jewel being the uncle who was accused and somewhat questionably not held accountable for the murder of his first wife and her sister... whom my aunt met when she went to visit her boyfriend in prison. They were cell mates...\n\nThese details just randomly drop here and there throughout my life. Every once in a while my sisters and I will exchange details to see what info we all separately have.

Well, from what I've been told, it's pretty much all due to Zelda's husband, Xavier, who was a mean, controlling, abusive asshole. Every one of his daughters talk about how awful he treated them, and apparently this was enough to spark Elaine to one day run away. She just couldn't take it anymore, and she left everything and everyone behind, including her new daughter Dana. It blows my mind that she could leave her new daughter behind, but that's apparently exactly what she did, and she's never been seen or heard from ever again.\n\nSo Dana was brought up by Zelda and Xavier as if she was their daughter, and Elaine has pretty much been erased from the family tree. Amanda would be my mother, and she says to this day Elaine's whereabouts are unknown (or if she's even still alive), and that Dana (who's now in her 50s) still believes Zelda is her mother.",

However, she had married a farmer, well out of town, and had a big family of 6. But when my grandma was about 10, her mother pulled her aside and said ‚Äúget off the farm, it‚Äôs no life for you\" and within a month had killed herself. So my grandmother, who was a real beauty, was determined to finish high school (unusual), left home to go to college (unusual), and went to work in a bank \"in the city\" until she was 27, (only single women were allowed to work in the bank!). That's when and where she met and shortly after married my grandfather.\nShe was gorgeous, and being single and unmarried at that age was highly unusual, she was basically considered an old maid -  at 27!  \n\nOn his side, his dad had committed a suspected murder suicide (wife) when all four kids were under 12. He was 2nd youngest. They never found her body, but he had allegedly sorta-confessed  to a neighbour before killing himself.  \n\nThe kids were fostered out (eldest brother and baby sister were both adopted and then moved literally thousands of miles away). My  granpa was sent to the abusive town drunk‚Äôs family. They treated him like a dog, literally. He slept in a shed. Got his food sent out in a bowl. He started running  away at 11/12 and was eventually allowed to live alone with his 14 year old brother on the family farm. Just the two of them!  Ended up becoming a very successful businessman. Had the farm and a road  building company, an insurance company and was eventually a landman in the oil industry. Waited until ~27 to get married which was again unusual in a small farming community then.  Had a nervous breakdown by 30. Seemed to recover well though. \n\nAlthough my mum and her sister‚Äôs childhood was likely tense at times, they had everything in the world in terms of parental love and resources. He was a lovely man.  She was a literal angel. He passed at 65, 3 months after retirement. Heart attack shovelling snow. She lived to 100. (Married her small town high school sweetheart, a widower himself, at 70 years old!  He was a legend too.  \n\nMy dad had a bit of a rough childhood too but it pales in comparison. \n\nAnd both my parents are amazing people, all things considered.\n\nMy siblings and cousins only really learned all of this in our 20s.  My mum kept it secret from us. My grandma actually told my wife a ton of stuff 10 years later, when on a long intercity bus ride, that my mum didn't even know.  That was the shock reveal!

He and his wife and her son were already living there but it was a decent sized house. During the workday my gf would stay home and take care of the baby and stepbrother stayed at home too cause typical stoner activity (or so I assumed. Apparently he had had a job right up until we were about to move in. Whatever. A couple  weeks in, gf came to me about stepbrother and she just felt uncomfortable like he was always kinda around and she felt like he was watching her too closely and she didn't wanna say anything at first cause it was my \"brother\" and if she was just being paranoid she would feel like an asshole. I told  her she has to not worry about that and come to me when she is uncomfortable. She said ok but asked me not to say anything until shee was sure and i reluctantly agreed. Couldn't sleep that night. Went to work  at 4am completely out of it, leaving my little family with this possible...alleged.... pervert. Around 10 am or so my caps calls the shop to get a hold of me.  I get on the phone and she tells me that some government agency is sitting with my half sister at the kitchen table talking about how step brother has been accused of sex with minors and they are looking for him. And half sister is sitting there lying to Gov person like its been rehearsed for years. She was at the house to intercept this person at the door so noone came up to my gf and started spewing all the details to her.  Just notice stepmother standing over my shoulder. She was listening to the conversation. She says \"people are  crazy stepbrother didn't do anything\" and other defensive shit and gf is freaking out on the phone like \"tombookah we have been alone with this guy don't know what he got into when he was peeping and what he did while me and daughter are sleeping\" I melted down. Can't legally say what happened the next couple or days besides finding out that EVERYONE ELSE knew about him. Sadly some knew because they were victims of his vile behavior and others were the ones covering it up for 15 years. That's my family secret. Must be karma cause the guy now has severe brain damage and is on the sex offender registry  both as a direct result of the evil he did. \n\nMy gf family secret came out that first,  her dad's brother might really be her dad cause her mom admitted to her at like 10 that she slutted it up with uncle while she was with dad.

As we continued talking she stated that they never really stopped messing with each other after all this time. Now they both had relationships with other people the entire time from 1995 to now.

She had been struggling with CPTSD, severe depression, and schizophrenia. When she passed away my older siblings told me the truth as to what had happened. \n\nI found out that when she was younger, her older cousins had molested and raped her and she spent all of her life hiding it. Prior to this my family had been really close with our extended family but grew apart, I did not know why at the time. My family oftentimes housed her and took her in when times were rough, and during that time she broke her story to my siblings. This was during the rise of the #metoo movement, and I soon found out my sister was also a victim to the same group of cousins. There are still other victims who have not come forward. \n\nRegardless, prior to her passing she had confronted the offenders at a family party to which they denied ever happened and called her crazy. The same with my sister. I think that lead her to isolate herself from our bigger family which I believe exacerbated her depression, CPTSD, and eventually development of schizophrenia leading her to take her own life. It really sucks, she was beginning to get a lot better once she started meds, exercising, found a job, and a boyfriend. Then one day she took her life out of the blue. \n\nMy family is still grieving over it all. The day of her funeral was very silent. Everybody had felt that the offenders were responsible for her death in a way, but they themselves would not own up to it. I no longer see that side of the family, in fact, it has disrupted our whole family dynamic. My parents rarely even see her siblings because of the fact that their children had molested/raped my parents daughter. I'm sure we're still grieving the loss of our family as well. I noticed my mom's depression has gotten a lot worse the following years. \n\nI was never supposed to find this out as I was practically a child at the time and only the older generation had known. The day she passed, no one was able to hold it in and spilled it to me and it destroyed my whole idea of family. Prior to this I believed family was everything and would spend summer and holidays with the larger family. That doesn't happen now. It feels like as you grow older your circle does become smaller. \n\nThe families with the abusers choose to side with their brothers' stories in that they never did it. However, I know for a fact that one of them apologized to her before she took her life because he had a daughter and felt immense guilt. My sister and her husband helped facilitated that apology as they were really close to him and our neice. Surprisingly, she accepted his apology. However, once his siblings found out they ridiculed our family for letting the secret out as they swore to never let it out. It was messy, and still is. \n\nI don't think they will ever stop being mad at our family for telling the truth. They care a lot about their image. But it's sad to know as a lot of this drama has sprinkled onto my generation creating lots of awkward tension between the younger generation despite not really being responsible nor involved for what had happened. Sometimes our parents don't like the idea of us hanging out as they despise eachother's families, but we spent all our childhood growing up together. \n\nMy sister is still dealing with her past trauma and has been diagnosed with CPTSD, which has been really hard on her. I'm not sure where this post is going but I wanted to vent my pent up emotions. \n\nP.S. I hope you found your peace and no longer have to suffer. I'm sorry you had to live all those years in silence suffering. It's been years but I still think about you.",

That's it.\n\nA couple years ago, the family's having wine and dishing. My aunt and I start arguing about removing Confederate  monuments from public spaces, so she takes me aside. She reveals that my great great(maybe another great) grandfather was the son of a confederate soldier who defected, was captured, and then released to return to Louisiana. However, when he got home he was tried and hanged for desertion. That left his sick wife and their wet nurse (a black slave) to care for their many children. After the war ended, his wife died of her illness. Despite being freed from her legal ownership, the wet nurse remained with the family and raised the orphaned children to adulthood.\n\nMy aunt used this family tale as the basis for her view that most slavery in the south was actually a mutually decent and consensual arrangement, but that version of American history has been erased from our culture. As she wistfully put it, our family wouldn't have survived if not for the love and care of a black woman whom they saw as a second mother... I wince in pain every time I think back on that conversation. \n\nSuddenly everything about my family made sense.

She was born during the 1918 Spanish flu, and she was not expected to survive, so they never bothered filling out the name portion on her birth certificate. Well she did survive, obviously, but still didn't have a name. She finally got it fixed, I think to collect Social Security benefits, by going to the county clerk with her older sister, who had to sign an affidavit that she was in fact who she said she was. Apparently it was one of her favorite stories to tell, but like I said I never heard it until after she died. I was in my 20s at the time too, so it's not like I was too young to be aware.",

We started out by staying over at our Aunts house for a few days, when out of the blue our (dumb lying cunt) cousin came and stayed over with us too. \n\nIt was fine at first, we had been having a good time with our aunt and uncle and reluctantly catching up with our cousin. One day we (my sisters, cousin and I) all decided to walk to the park in our aunts neighborhood. My sisters and cousin got on the topic of smoking weed and wishing they had some to smoke. I wasn‚Äôt interested and didn‚Äôt think they would be able to get any, so paid it no mind. Until cousin said she had friends who could hook them up. \n\nWalked home, had dinner, the night panned out as the previous ones had, until the security alarm started blaring throughout the house because of an opened window in the room my sisters and cousin were hanging out in. Turns out cousin had asked her friend to bring them weed and pass it through the window, but lo and behold no one knew there was an alarm. \n\nUncle stormed in cussing up a storm angry as all hell for no reason. Rest of the night was tense as we were all sent to bed early. \n\nMorning comes and my sisters and I fix ourselves breakfast, cause Uncle and Aunt and cousin are nowhere to be seen. They were having a private discussion in the master bathroom while we had no clue one was happening as we weren‚Äôt invited to partake. \n\nWhen our aunt emerged, she sat us all down and told us we couldn‚Äôt stay at her house anymore because she didn‚Äôt want anything to happen when she went to work. Super out of the blue, but she had already called our mom and asked her to pick us up. \n\nWe were upset and didn‚Äôt understand why, or what, cousin had said to have us kicked out of our aunt and uncles house when she was free to stay. Drama unfolded ofc as everyone in the family heard something or other about why we weren‚Äôt able to stay, but the only explanation we were given was our aunt not wanting any ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù to happen when she wasn‚Äôt around. \n\nOur family relations fell apart. We didn‚Äôt talk to any family on my dads side after that trip for a long time because of the way they had treated us and kicked us out without explanation. To this day I still don‚Äôt talk with any of them regularly. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause I recently found out my dear lovely cousin told my aunt my sisters and I were trying to sell our bodies for cigarettes at the park and were planning to sneak out that night to try again. And she must have believed it. \n\nTo this day, it still hurts to think about how unfairly my sisters and I were treated ON TOP of having such a shitty accusation put against us and believed by someone I loved and admired. My cousin can choke for all I care, I bet the reason she said those things is because she had plenty of experience first hand....anyway, that‚Äôs the family secret I can share within my immediate family because I could care less what kind of secrets the rest of my extended family has.",

I was 12 and I was pretty close with grandma and I was told it was an accident. My aunt spilled the beans when I was like 25.\n\nMy grandfather I never met on my father's side because he didn't want to meet me, was married 7 times, and fathered about 15 kids. I only know 3 of them, including my father. I was told he was just so busy we never could visit. He died in his 90s.\n\nMy grandfather on my mother's side was apparently not dead. We were told out whole lives he died in Vietnam. He DID go to Vietnam, but apparently my grandmother hated him so much for joining the Navy in like 65, rather than risk being drafted, she disappeared from his life and told everyone he died in the war. We only found out her lies from her journal we got after she committed suicide. We connected on Facebook and turns out he had been looking for my mother, his daughter, for decades. Neat story, cause my mother finally met her real father, but then he died like 6 months later and I never got to meet him though we had a trip planned.\n\nLast thing... Apparently my Uncle on my father's side who I met only 1 time in Boston got mixed up with the Italian mob and now works for them in Philadelphia. I have made friends with my cousins on Facebook, but we just have nothing in common beyond blood so we've never really gone out of our way to meet up. \n\nOh and final scandal of just my own family, as we are Catholics converted to Mormons, at least my mother. Well, Mormons are super strict about the whole no sex before marriage thing. My mother got pregnant with my sister's and told everyone they were premature twins when she had them 3 months early, just 6 months after getting married. I have the knowledge now to know they were right on time lol. This could have gotten you disfellowshipped from the church and it was big drama when I pointed it out because my mother has been so staunch molly Mormon example our whole lives, and she got angry in denial even though she knows my own sins I've made in these regards as I have been honest with my parents about my life and relationships. But nope, she is still perfect. It was a mini drama in our direct family where my mother threatened to cancel family get together over a holiday unless we all agreed to never bring it up again lol.",

The older brother list an eye and died young. \n\nAs an older teen, we drove to Florida for a vacation whilevmy dad stayed to work and would later fly down to meet us.  My mother pointed out a binder by my feet to read and share with my sister. It was a series of news clippings about my father and grandfather. In the early 80s, there was a political upheaval in our area. My grandfather, an city engineer for three different towns at different times was the target if a RICO investigation. He was being charged with conflict of interest and official misconduct. He was approving plans that came through his own offices so, technically, yeah.  He would have fought it if not for my father's involvement. My father did the field work and drafting for as many jobs as two men but wasn't  a licensed engineer, being shy a few credits.  As a result, one of the other licensed engineers trusted his work enough and hated staying late to approve the plans enough that he made a template so my dad could just put his signature on the plans without him. He was going to be charged with over 200 counts of forgery with a potential penalty of 50+ years in prison. Grandpa threw in the towel, stepped down from his position, and paid restitution. Nobody was really clean in the deal, not my grandpa, my dad, the township, or the prosecutor. That's Jersey for you.\n\nAs an adult, a friend of my sister and I called to hang out because he had some news.  He told us that his mom had done the 23 Ancestry Whatever test and finally found out who her bio dad was. It was my dad's uncle, a local legend hulk of a man that had died a bachelor.

Together they had 18 children. No one ever knew about what my great grandfather had done, until he and granddad went out to eat for lunch at a Kentucky diner one day and the waitress was my my grandfather‚Äôs half sister. GrandDad told me the story, but still a lot of the other kids never knew. My granddad was born in the Great Depression, he was often beaten, they only ever ate beans and there was never enough, and taken out of school in third grade to go to work full time. One hell of a life the man lived, but he had such an incredible disposition. Happy go lucky, kind to a fault, and never had a bad word to say about anyone. It amazes me, because most of his 17 brothers and sisters died young of alcoholism, or ended up in prison. That sort of childhood can and often does break a person.",

It turned out to be cancer in another lymph node fucking with her kidney function, but that doesn't matter.  Mostly because we were forced to by \"Pappy\", the whole family and extended family got tested for organ compatibility. Get the results a few weeks later, (early 2000's) and they were interesting..\n\nMy mother has AB ‚Äê blood, which is rare. Her mother and father have O-. Punet square says that don't make no sense. My brother, sister, and I have AB +, and my dad has A+. My aunt and uncle have O- and my cousins have mixes of A's and B's that don't really matter to the story. So who is the dirty dog with the universal donor blood? \n\nPappy is my grandmother's 2nd, as well as 4th husband.  She and her first husband were together until my mother, the youngest, was 5 years old, but apparently grandma and Pappy were doing the deed long before the ink dried on her divorce papers. He has AB- blood. \n\nThe worst part is that Pappy was also the man who throughout our childhoods raped me, several of my female cousins, and we all suspect that he did it to my mother and aunt. So finding out that the man who raped you as a child is your biological grandfather really rubs more salt into already pretty salty wound because the entire family just ignored Pappy's proclivities to having his preteen \"granddaughters\" over for sleepovers. \n\nDespite how grossed out and angry I was at 17 when I found all this out, it helped me begin to make an exit plan. Within a year, I left and used the blood tests and testimony from my cousins to help my dad get sole custody of my younger brother and sister. We've all got about a decade of therapy under our belts, and had a nice drink together the day Pappy died of his 3rd stroke.",

(Like, these two were married in January and had a baby in April, and then figured out that a baby takes longer than that lol). \n\nI‚Äôll clarify, I don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with any of these things, but in my family they were huge secrets. \n\nThat was a lot longer than I thought. Going to do another comment on my wife‚Äôs crazy family.

His father was a machinist at the national mint (and later the post office) but was also largely a useless drunk at home and beat his wife till my grandfather and his brother kicked his ass and he never did it again. My grandfather and his brothers fought a lot, but when his brother bill died fairly young it really scarred him and he was mostly estranged from his family till he reconnected with his sister in his 80s. \n\nGrandpa served in Korea as well but did not consider himself a veteran because he was a quartermaster and never was in combat. Learning my grandfather was a quartermaster made so many things click for me with his personality and organizational habits. He was also a wheeler dealer and was 100% probably in some way capitalizing on his position. \n\nLater in life he was an electrician and worked on most of the large government buildings in DC. Digging through some paperwork with my grandmother later on I found a radiation dosing record, apparently grandpa worked on a lot of nuclear reactors. \n\nAlso once his foreman accused him of stealing materials from the job site to build his house, grandpa didn‚Äôt like that so much so they got in a fist fight but he still kept his job because it was seen that the accusation was a reason to fight. Joke was on them though because he had been stealing shit for months and built his house mostly for free. \n\nWhen he met my grandmother she was working in a government office he was also doing a long job in, and he asked her out every day for over a year before she caved. In her words ‚Äúhe was a bit of a jerk but he never gave up‚Äù. \n\nGrandpa was kinda an ass.\n\nIn his life he was a soldier, an electrician, a realtor, a real estate investor (failed), operated a worm farm in his basement, had a business wholesaling lobster, and was constantly making deals and working an angle. He was charismatic till he died and people were either drawn to him, or very off put, a very strong personality. \n\nHe passed last March and I miss his stories, and wish he‚Äôd told me a lot more. He was strong till his last moments, he could probably have broken your hand while shaking it if he wanted. He adored his grand children, and my kids.

AT ALL. One day, I was around 11-ish. A woman showed up at our front door asking for my dad. I didn't know who it was. So he came out with my mom, walked out to the street and talked to the woman. My mom came in crying, and I thought to myself, \"fucking homewrecker\". Later that evening when everyone calmed down, my parents sat us down (my brother, sister, and I), and told us that Dad had been married before my mom, and doesn't like talking about it. The woman was his daughter from the marriage and was coming to ask for money. We all accepted that people have a past, and left it alone. No biggie, right?\n\nCut to 20 years later.\n\nMy brother and sister have a friend, that mentions his mom. Turns out his mom IS my dad's daughter. So my sibling's friend is technically our nephew. Wow Small World, but hey, it's life right?\n\nCut to 2 years later.\n\nI receive a letter in the mail from an attorney. I'm being listed as an heir-at-law for someone's estate. I don't know the name at all so I call my mom. She says, \"I dunno, call the attorney, there might be some money for you.\" So I called him. No answer, left a message. THEN My mom calls me back, and starts stammering, rambling, \"your dad and I talked, and we want you to know we still love you, etc.\" Literally every line from every movie when someone is about to say \"you're adopted.\" So I ask, \"Mom, am I adopted?\" She says yes, starts bawling on the phone, and the attorney calls back. So I swap over. He can't tell me WHY I'm listed. I told him I JUST found out (at age 36-ish, mind you). He says it's my biological father's parents estate, my father's cousins have been taking care of them before they passed. I'm a good person, I said, \"I don't know these people, I don't have any right to the estate, can you please just pass along my contact info, I would love to know about my father.\"\n\nOver the next year, I found out my bio father was murdered in a breakin, he was home and the robbers stabbed him.

Our parents don't know we know this last part, but it's in the universe now. \n\nWe love our parents, even though they kept big ass secrets from us for way too long. They raised us to be good people.

Usually the few years prior their three daughters (2nd cousins) come along and we catch up on what's happening in the years. Well they were at their boyfriends (now husbands) family gatherings at the time.\n\nSo it was a quiet dinner, and we're talking about the family as a whole, and note that this was my great aunt's final Christmas due to dying in Easter in the coming months. Pulmonary Fibrosis is a bitch. Well she was talking about my dad's brother and his three kids. She revealed a big secret I never noticed growing up, but that my oldest cousin is not my uncle's biological son. Apparently he was a little baby when my uncle met my aunt. And my uncle fully embraced him as his own early on. I was told by my dad to keep it hush hush and don't mention it to anyone.\n\nWell..... fast forward to summer 2017. Of those three cousins, the youngest got married in May, and the middle was getting married in August. Everyone from our branch of the family came to the youngest cousin, and I was the only one to make it to the middle cousin's wedding. That because everyone spend their money going to the 1st wedding, and the 2nd wedding was more of a smaller venue. I asked days before the 2nd wedding if there was any openings for me to attend, which at first was a no, but when our grandmother fell I'll and couldn't make it, my middle cousin was demanding me to get my ass over there ASAP. Well after the middle cousin's wedding that night, my oldest cousin had to leave early to go home and rest before an early morning shift at the hospital. I told him that I know about his biological background. Hell, I even told his parents privately months prior when I was there that I knew. I said if he felt being different all these years, especially since his siblings (my actual bio 1st cousins) are now married, that he shouldn't think that, and that he's always been my cousin. I love this son of a bitch of a guy, he has my last name and all, and hell he made damn good moonshine at the 2nd wedding. He was really appreciated of my comment of me knowing. We hugged it out, and wished him the best at his work the next day.\n\nI did unfortunately earlier that night told a random guest at the reception of their question on why my oldest cousin looks different. Me being a couple of drink too much before blacking out, I passively suggested there was some history to it, it's just not my place to say it. And that footnote I told that little questioning to my aunt when she was taking me to the airport days later. She felt a little frustrated that I said that to someone at the party. I understand her end, and felt bad about it. It's just I didn't know how to lie while a few drinks in me, and thought that the large majority of friends of my family members in the area knew one way or another. Even my aunt and uncle didn't shy from that kind of questioning when showing the family pictures around their house.\n\nTL;DR: Found out years ago a good 1st cousin of mines isn't biologically related to me. Still love the SOB and didn't think anything different about him.",

I could tell ya about all the times I would purposefully lose at family events just to make the rest of them happy but the one that really sticks out is when i got my youngest sister to play Call of Duty Black ops (1-4).\n\n   She was excited to play a shooter game and i was more than happy to help with that. After some time passed her skill lvl got to a point where she could fend for herself decently online so she decided to instead of online coop she wanted to 1v1 me. I accepted and we would exchange insults and were racing to see who would get 30 kills first. First time she won by a nail biter of 30 to 29 and she was so happy she wanted a rematch. We played and she barely lost by 29 to 30 kills. If i know the person im playing with isnt as skilled as me insteadof being a parading asshole id rather make the game more interesting and make it very close from start to finish so that we are both having fun. This went on for years and she questioned me a couple times if i was \"going easy\" on her but i would just deny her and we would continue playing Black Ops together. After 4 years (2019) I had a friend over and we decided to do a 1v1 session and we are just doing these crazy CoD high speed plays and after we played online and i was just tearing the lobby a new one. I didnt know she was home nor did i know she was watching us and all i hear is \"WHEN THE F%$K WHERE YOU SO GOOD AT THIS GAME?\" I jumped then seeing her getting all puffy faced i laughed a bit and said that i watched some streamer and learned some tricks (bullshit i know). She just gave me the dirtiest look and demanded we 1v1 and i dont go easy on her. Well i didnt go easy on her and she got her answer and then she started interrogating me about what else i went easy on her. This cascaded to her telling the rest of the family and everyone else realizing that i have been pretending to either be oblivous or have scaled my skills down to tailor myself to thier level. Everyone got emotional but they also were appreciative that i made those family events enjoyable for 8 years. I was really hoping i could keep this secret with me but oh well.",

I always grew up knowing that my maternal grandma's older sister had a different father. What i was told growing up from my grandma was that my half great aunt's bio father died in ww2. It wasnt until i was 17 i think that i was told by my grandpa when i first met him (grandparents divorced well before i waa born) that no, it was a baby out of wedlock. Years later my half great aunt tells my mom that she also had a younger full brother my great grandma gave up for adoption because she was too poor to take care of 2 children. Shortly after she met my great grandpa and had 3 more kids. \n\nAnother family secret is the same grandma lying about her mom not being half native american. Its a weird thing to lie about but my grandma is pretty racist and is ashamed about being mixed. We still dont fully know because its caused a lot of confusion but honestly its really obvious she is half and my grandma doesnt look full white. \n\nWe also recently found out that my paternal great grandfather was married twice to 2 cougars who both fell fatally ill BEFORE becoming a hobo and coming back to his home town and marrying my great grandma after being rejected by her many times since high school.",

His mother remarried in the next few years, and my dad has a half sister from his mom and stepfather. \n\nMy dad has a cousin, Cassie, who is a little younger than him, young enough not to remember the divorce or remarrying. But, like I said, it wasn't exactly a secret that Greg wasn't his dad. There was just no reason to bring it up? But one Christmas, when Cassie was a teenager, for whatever reason, my dad's bio dad ended up joining them at their Christmas party. Cassie asked her mother who this guy was, and she casually said \"that's Mark's dad\" and Cassie, absolutely floored, sputtered \"I thought that was Greg!\" \n\nCassie is in her 40s now but she's still mad nobody bothered to tell her about this until this \"random guy\" just showed up. And *apparently* everyone else knew who he was. \n\nAnd to be clear, my dad spent weekends at his father's. His parents had shared custody. So his father was very involved in *his* life... It's not like he was a deadbeat who didn't show up for years. He just wasn't involved with Cassie, since she was a cousin on my dad's mother's side.",

This first family lived in his homestate of Virginia. The marriage broke down. He walked out on his family. His sons never forgave him. (I mean, right? That's... I can't imagine how brutal, how painful that was.)\n\nAfter marrying my great-grandmother in the midwest, the couple settled near her family in Illinois where they raised two daughters. The oldest was my Grandmother. Her name was Virginia. \n\nNo one knows if Grandma-the-Great knew about the first wife and children. Theories in the family abound.\n\nNeither my grandmother nor her sister knew about their four half brothers until 2003. Grandma was in her 80s.\n\nThe story goes that Grandpa-the-Great's sons wanted nothing to do with their father. The anger was still so raw, the betrayal and abandonment was a wound open for their entire lives.  I don't think they knew they had half sisters. \n\nAs such, it was understood that none of their decedents could, nor would, look to see what became of Great-Grandpa while his sons lived. So, no one did. But after they all passed, someone started digging. It took some doing, and some time, but they found us in 2003. \n\nWhenever monumental secrets like this are revealed, memories become illuminated.

Upon meeting this grandchild, Grandpa-the-Great is reported to have been taken aback. Slightly arrested, even.

First off a spit out some fudge into a napkin and handed it to me telling me to eat it but I wouldn‚Äôt. Then kept wanting me to go in the hot tub with him. And he kept saying he didn‚Äôt bite. I didn‚Äôt want to but I was basically being forced to by my family. Until I guess my mom heard and she came downstairs and made up some lie that she needed me for something and my mom this confident loud Italian women was so quiet and couldn‚Äôt look him in his eyes and she was practically shaking holding onto me. So I went upstairs with her and told her about the fudge and she was so disgusted and all she told me was that he was a creepy guy. And I didn‚Äôt found out until a few years later from my father why she had acted like this.\n\nI mean I remember one time when I was like 7 my grandma took me with her to his house one time and when I came back my mom started screaming at my grandma and crying and asking me if I was ok which I was. I might be wrong but I don‚Äôt think my grandma believes my mom in what happened because it‚Äôs her own brother.",

Throwaway account to protect privacy of family members.\n\nMy family is very religious, and my great-grandparents are no exception. (Throughout this post, I will refer to them both as GG and PP \\[great-grandmother and Papa respectfully\\]) They went to church all the time and were pretty healthy, other than the fact that they both suffered some major health conditions, but were a happy couple until GG died in the summer of 2019 due to cancer. Of course, PP, who raised 2 kids with her and took care of her despite her Alzheimers and taking her to the dialysis clinic early in the morning for years, was heartbroken. She was the love of his life, and I can't imagine the pain he felt losing his partner of 70-something years.\n\nThe Christmas before GG passed, my aunt, grand-daughter of my aforementioned great-grandparents, received a 23andMe kit. She took the test, and a few weeks later the results came back. She looked through her lineage and saw something strange. A mysterious woman  (whom we will call AW, anonymous woman) who she hadn't heard of showed up to be her aunt. My aunt reached out to her apparent aunt and discussed how they could possibly be related. Maybe one of PP's cousins, who was notoriously promiscuous, had a daughter, or maybe the test was faulty, although that was unlikely. It was until one detail popped up that everything clicked into place.\n\nGG and PP were friends with AW's parents. They lived right next to each other and were very close. Apparently GG, always extremely religious from the day she was born, had an affair with AW's dad and got pregnant. They both played it off like it was actually PP who was the dad, but it was not.\n\nMy grandmother (i will refer to as GM) never felt like she fit in with her siblings. She didn't have any similarities to them or to her father, but now she had a possible cause for this. GM took a 23andMe test, and it confirmed that GM and AW were sisters, both from the same dad but from different moms.\n\nAfter this revelation, GM and AW met up and for the past 1 1/2 years we have brought them into our big family. They had no family other than their sons, one whom abandoned them due to the son's estranged wife cutting contact with them. They said that it was a blessing that we had come to meet, although not under the most ideal of circumstances. So now everyone in the family, except for PP and GM's siblings, knows about this, and if we let them know, PP might die of heartbreak because he already has heart issues and is approaching 100 years old, and then GM's siblings are just brats, so there's that as well.\n\nHopefully I didn't drag this out too long. Have a good day, everyone.\n\nAlso: Sorry I can't answer questions, this is on a random throwaway and i forgot the password and email. Oops.",

Since I resemble him quite a lot, I was curious about what he was like, and I thought it was weird that I'd always get short, one-sentence answers whenever I'd ask about his personality, interests, or personal history.\n\nFast forward to my late 20s.  I'm living with my parents and really depressed, and I tell my dad one day that I'd been having suicidal thoughts.  He gets super quiet and looks like he just got punched in the gut.  For two full days, whenever I see him, it's just awkward silence and a pained grimace.  \n\nFinally, on the morning of the third day, I find him curled up on his bedroom floor sobbing uncontrollably (I honestly thought he had a kidney stone), and he tells me the truth about his dad: he was a pharmacist and had become addicted to a host of heavy narcotics in an effort to treat what we now think was clinical depression, and, rather than face the potential loss of his business and shame from the community (they were super religious) that would come from admitting his problem and dealing with it, he drove up a canyon one day and overdosed in his car.  My dad was the one who found him five days later (yes, the smell was apparently unholy, and, I'm told, unforgettable), and had to deal with the shit-show that was his estate.  \n\nThe whole family quickly agreed that, in order to save face in the very judgey religious community, they'd tell everyone it was a heart attack, and this fiction was eventually passed on to all the in-laws and grandchildren.  As far as I know, my sister and I (now late 30s) are the only grandchildren who know the truth.  My mom didn't even know until after my dad told me.",

His best friend was *very* religious and against abortions, but helped my dad and never said another word about it. \n\n\nAnother one was the fact that my grandma on my mom's side cheated on my grandpa for many years. Grandpa certainly knew about it. I don't remember why she decided to end the affair, but she did. It is just bizarre to learn, because they were such a devoted couple and seemed in love, even while she was losing her mind to dementia. \n\nThe last, and worst one, is the reason we distanced ourselves from part of our family.  They're not technically blood related family, but for years were a huge part of our lives and then suddenly weren't and it was weird.  Basically, my uncle found out that his step sister's kids were being molested by one of the men in the family (I forget who). My uncle tried to tell everyone on that side of the family, and they essentially admitted that they knew, and many of them even blamed the kids! His step sister protected the abuser throughout this process, and allowed him to live with her.  What made my uncle even angrier, is that she knew this was going on while they all lived together and his kids were living in the same house with this man.  Thankfully, it doesn't seem that he ever laid a hand on my niece. Uncle rightly got CPS involved, and he was outcast from that side of the family as if he'd done something wrong. Of course my uncle told my dad since they're brothers and my dad had two young kids by this point. Dad immediately cut off anyone who defended the abusive dude (so a ton of our \"family\").

Turns out my grandmas bio dad was 45 minutes from her the entire time, never moved. At this point, he had passed but he still had one daughter that was alive. My grandma didn't want to meet her and didn't want any of our family to meet them. My aunt talked to them a little to get some more background information but never really got close.",

Well, in the process, we actually made two discoveries. The first was that we did identify a close living relative on my dad's side who we never heard of; however, he wasn't my biological grandfather but his brother. Finding my grandpa took some digging through truth finder.com as well as another DNA test, this time for my dad. My dad found his number, where he lived, Facebook, etc. and contacted him. They met up and it was a pretty cool experience for him. I didn't go, however, because I'm terrified of flying. The second and more surprising thing was that I found fairly close cousins and relatives supposedly on my mom's side that she never even heard of. One name in particular stuck out to her. She remembered her mom (my grandma) introducing her to a man many years ago who went by the same name; my grandma told her he was her real father. However, she didn't believe this for a few reasons I won't get into. Now she knew it really was true. She contacted some of the relatives, met her father (though he had dementia or alzheimer's), and met siblings she never knew she had.",

Dont know why. \n Years later at 23  What I thought was a rumor from my aunt to my wife after she told her that my real dad was looking for me. I told my wife she's just starting shit to spite my mom and she should mind her own business.. It Lingered around for a while in my mind as I suspected could possibly be true because it made sense as cold as my dad was. \n  I get home one day at 37 I go to my man cave and grab a beer told my wife I need time after the day. \n I hear the phone ring and on the TV is the caller ID and its the name of my rumored father. I am fkn frozen. I hear my wife answer and she knocks on door and says its your dad!  I spoke with him and he's talking fast and I'm guessing because he thinks I'm going to hang up, I told him to relax and spoke with him for a while. He then says I need to get home please answer when I call you brothers and sisters would live to talk to you! Holy shit!  I assured him, he calls back and I speak to my 15 yr old brother, 8 yr old bro and 12 yr old sis. \n \nHe was looking for me since I was 23. He says he spoke with a woman when he found a number and got the courage to call.  He says he was told to leave me alone that I wanted to have nothing to do with him. That I was a man now and no longer needed him.  To this day we have no idea who that was. \n   He lost hope and stop searching till I was 37 and his new wife encouraged him to.  I lost all those years. \n  I got the courage to ask my existing siblings and my mom and no one denied he was my dad.  No one ever told me. Led me to believe the other guy was my dad.  What the fuck!  Everyone knew even uncles and aunts. It was a huge secret by everyone except me. WTF! \n  I decided to grow my relationship with him which was great for about 9 years. Covid took him in January \n\n I am glad I opened up to accept him and we did what we could while we could. I would visit and would go swimming in the river and other things with my 1/2 brothers and sisters and forgot I was 37 yrs old.  I have no regrets besides my family stolen all that time I could have spent with him, and who ever he talked to on the phone to turn him away. \n\n I grew a successful company with the Last name of my dad on it with pride.

My dad is the only one in his family who had a proper job.  The rest of the family members on his side were often freeloaders or government dolebludgers who'd spend all their money on ciggies etc. The uncle that snapped used to call up our phone, and ask to speak to my dad and yell abuse and threats to him on the other side of the phone.  My dad never did anything wrong and obviously this made us upset and we were all affected by it. Thankfully the family failed because they had no proper case and my dad won the court case that went on for several years and he had many health issues because of it before hand. The court threw out the case because the family had no proper evidence against him and they also had to pay for all of the services and damages. Yay!  Because of my young age at the time this all happened, my parents tried (but obviously failed) to keep this a secret from me. But end up telling me later the whole story.\n\nI've since disowned my aunts & uncles as my family because of this. We never have communicated properly again. I don't even see my cousins again, but that's ok, because I don't want to. My parents don't even talk to them again either. When my sister was small, the uncle that snapped called her up on the phone while my dad was in hospital and kept on asking which hospital he was in. My sister kept saying \"I don't know\". My uncle apparently said \"You do know, I know you're lying.\" But she wasn't. She told my mum and had to ring up the family's place to tell them what happened and \"never call us on this phone number ever again'. Thankfully my dad is since OK now and like us, happy to not deal with them anymore. We never see any of those family members ever again, but not like that's a bad thing.\n\nI always knew one of my uncles was a drummer, like me. But I never heard him play and he would never let me touch his drums as a kid. He was a jerk, putting that politely. My mum said one reason why I have a drum kit now, and play drums is because one of the uncles once said \"I should buy you a drum kit for your birthday\". My mum knew he would never do this and he didn't. So eventually that's' why my parents got me a Drum kit one Christmas. Kind of a funny story really.

However, he was in his late 20s, working a demanding on call job, and his first wife had just abandoned their toddler son at the demands of her new husband.\n\nHe was living in a shitty apartment, working 65 hours a week, usually overnights, and now alone taking care of two children under the age of 3.\n\nWithin a year or so, he finally caved and gave his daughter up for adoption. The family was very wealthy, lived in a great area, and were unable to have a child of their own.\n\nHe even tried to negotiate being a part of her life, but the family felt it would be best to raise her as their own. It killed him, but he agreed, and agreed not to contact her, under the stipulation that she be told what happened when she was of age.\n\nWithin a few weeks of her 18th birthday, she located my stepdad. He and my mom were well married at this point (my mom knew about this from the beginning).\n\nHe and my mom had moved out of state when I was 20, and it took a couple years before I was ever able to go visit.\n\nSo as my mom was in town, and we were planning my first visit down to them, she told me basically \"by the way, this is a thing that happened, and when you're visiting, your step sister will be down here as well.\"\n\nShe and her adoptive mother (her adoptive father passed away shortly before her 18th birthday) are now very much part of the family.\n\nHis son had a pretty rough life, and unfortunately died of a heroin OD on his 25th birthday, just a few months after meeting her.\n\nI went back and read all the articles I could find about it. The quotes in the articles are so purely him.\n\nAlso purely him is the fact that he's spent the last 25 years STILL turning down offers to be on shows like Oprah, Ellen, etc, and numerous paid book deals, and the like. All he ever wanted out of the whole situation was to provide the best life he could for his daughter, even though that meant giving her up.\n\nShe now does a lot of work with Safe Haven. She's kind of a typical mid 20s girl. You can tell she kind of loves the attention she's gotten from it, and I believe she's actually accepted a book deal - much to his chagrin - but at the end of the day, the work she's doing IS a net positive, so he's happy to support her endeavors.\n\nHe's one of the most loyal, honorable people you could ever meet. It's never unclear to him what the right thing to do is. Life has thrown him a lot of bullshit for his efforts, and even though I always generally liked him, it's uneasy to really see a stepdad as part of your parental unit, especially when they come into your life when you're already nearly an adult, but reading and learning about how he handled that situation earned a lot of respect and adoration from me, as it made me realize that all the kind things he did for me growing up had nothing to do with the uneasiness of being a step parent, or anything to do with making my mom happy - he was doing them because, without hesitation, he knows the right thing to do, does it, and his greatest pleasure in life is to help people and make other people happy.\n\nMy real dad is no slouch by any means, and very much part of me, but even though my stepdad has never once felt the need to teach it or explain it to me, I learned the joy of selflessness, and the value of true morals - not the kind you have to do mental gymnastics to justify - from watching him.\n\nGod, what a good fucking guy he is. I should call him tomorrow.",

He spent the whole 5 years fighting in the front, he even turned 18 at the front (his family thought the war \"would make a man out of him\", and that it would open a door for him to start a military career, they had no idea of what it would be like). He had PTSD, but obviously received no help, Freud was just getting started at the time, so he turned to alcohol and smoking to try to cope. Went bankrupt twice... he had a difficult life, and so had my grandpa and his siblings. \n\nKnowing this really helped me understand many \"silences\" on my grandpa's side of the family, and why he kept a bayonet next to a few old pictures. He was the only one allowed to touch it, and he would sometimes hold it in silence.

John also sent me letters that my grandfather had written to John's mother that referenced my grandmother and the illicit affair he was carrying on with John's mother. \nI contacted my brothers and asked if they thought we should let our dad know of these developments. I was on the fence and they both said no. In the meantime, Joe died. \nIt's been a couple years since this happened. We still haven't mentioned this to Dad who is now 80. Back when I told him I had tracked down his father's grave he was decidedly uninterested.

            "text": "Okay really recently a low-key family bombshell was dropped and I haven't talked to anyone about it. \n\nokay so for context: in the 60s, my dad married his first wife, had three kids and adopted two, very US nuclear family. then he went to Vietnam, was in the army for about 20 years, they divorced in the early 80s. My mom and dad met some time after that and eloped in the later 80s (my favorite photo ever is the only photo from their elopement, which was on a boat off the coast of mexico if I remember correctly?). \n\nIt caused a HUGE family fight on my mom's side, because my mother's Irish Catholic parents were horrified that their 19 year old eloped with a war veteran more than twice her age who already had 5 kids and an ex-wife. it also caused a HUGE fight on my dad's side because my mom was the same age as one of my dad's daughters and they were already not thrilled about their parent's divorce to begin with. \n\nbut, eventually, everyone got over it. there's a lot of love in my family, which is always wanna stress when I talk about this stuff because on paper my dad can sound kinda don draperish and patriarchal and bleh. and idk I wasn't there, but my maternal grandparents eventually came around and my dad's kids forgave him, I think because he was just a genuine gentle giant. he was 6'4\" and was just very warm and kind. naturally boomingly loud voice, loved to eat anything, could fall asleep anywhere anytime, and absolutely adored all of his kids. he and my mom had a really happy marriage and had me and my 5 siblings. He died in 2005 of cancer. okay, that's the overly detailed context. \n\nJump to 2020, my brother and I were at my mom's for  mother's day. my other siblings weren't there because of COVID restrictions. my brother was going through my mom's filing cabinet because he had recently gotten obsessed with learning more about our dad, since he had died when we were young and never wanted to talk about his time in the army, there was a lot of gray area for us. so he was digging through documents and stuff. \n\nAnd boy oh boy did he learn more! Amid his birth and death certificates and pictures and shit, my brother found an envelope addressed to our dad from circa 2007. it was from a personal investigator, who had been trying to find/reach out to my dad for years, for over a decade, on the behalf of a young Vietnamese woman who had spent the majority of her adult life searching for her father, an American soldier who had dated (and unknowingly impregnated) her mother during the Vietnam war. her mother said that they had lost contact after he left Vietnam and she didn't know until after he was gone that she was pregnant. The piping hot tea that we learned after questioning our mother is apparently, my dad and his first wife were quietly separated for a lot of their marriage, and he was dating a vietnamese woman while he was deployed. Their daughter basically only had his name, some of his army information, and a photo of the two of them to go off of when she hired a private investigator to help her find her father once she was an adult. This letter from the PI got to my mother about 2 years after my dad died. My mom told my dad's ex-wife about the letter, and she asked my mom not to tell any of us. she was worried about how her kids would react, especially since this was before ancestry.com and they couldn't \"prove it\" yet. She feels bad that she didn't respond to her back then, but she was a single mom with six kids and was still grieving, I don't blame her for not responding. But she encouraged my brother to respond when he found the letter last May. \n\nLong story short, I have a half sister I didn't know about! The DNA results just officially came in a few weeks ago and confirmed it. She lives in a different part of the US as my family but she, her husband, and their dog took a road trip to come meet us. they're extremely lovely people, and I really, really wish she could've met our dad. they would've loved each other. my mom said she and I both have our dad's chin.",

My mom and her younger sisters all look extremely similar but the oldest daughter, didn‚Äôt look like my grandparents too much. In fact, people always joked that she looked identical to my grandma‚Äôs sister, could practically be twins. Well plot twist - turns out my grandma‚Äôs sister is actually my aunts biological mom. \n\nWhen my grandparents were in their 20s they moved to a small farm in Virginia from Kentucky. My grandma had 13 siblings so they were ready to leave and start a new life. Right after they moved my grandma‚Äôs youngest sister, who was 16, got knocked up. Keep in mind the year is 1955 so she was absolutely terrified of the repercussions to follow of an unwed, pregnant 16 year old girl from the south. Due to this my grandma was worried for her safety along with the baby, especially because my great grandfather was not the nicest man. He would have done whatever he had to do to get rid of the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù so it wouldn‚Äôt bring shame to the family name.\n\nSo they created this elaborate plan for my grandmas sister to come visit the farm for a few months during the summer. The first 6 months she hid her pregnancy with big skirts and the remaining few months her and her boyfriend came to the farm. It was there that she gave birth to my aunt. Also to make this more fun, during those first six months my grandma was actually sending letters to her parents telling them the exciting news that she was pregnant with her ‚Äúfirst child‚Äù. \n\nMy grandpa, my grandma, her sister and her boyfriend all made the collective decision for my grandparents to raise my aunt. Her sister and boyfriend eventually got married, and would come to visit every year for the rest of their lives. So often, I grew up knowing them as ‚ÄúUncle Bill and Aunt Sue.‚Äù \n\nThis was such a tight secret, my grandparents took it to the grave. They both passed away 15 years ago and didn‚Äôt tell a soul. My aunt found out a few years ago after my Great Uncle Bill passed. Aunt Sue finally decided it was time to tell my aunt the truth. \n\nMy aunt was obviously distraught, but she managed to see the positives in it later on. Both women were so incredibly brave during that time and had so much love for her. My aunt still calls my grandparents her mom and dad, but she became extremely close to Aunt Sue before she passed. \n\nIt‚Äôs funny because looking back on it now, Uncle Bill and Aunt Sue were the only extended family that I knew, none of my grandmas other siblings would visit. I thought they were just extremely close to my grandparents but really it was just to be close to my aunt. After my aunt, they decided to not have any children. They told everyone Sue was unable to get pregnant but really it was the pain from giving up my aunt that stopped them from having anymore. \n\nSummary: I have some strong, badass women in my family.",

            "text": "Okay.. I got a bit trauma out of this...\n\nFirst, I was raised in Amazonia. We lived at the capital, but dad had a small farmhouse at a community half way buried in the woods - the only thing keeping the house apart from the wall of greenery and the creepy noises was a thick chainmail fence. I remember having to wait for mom to check inside shoes and clothing for scorpions, and if we forgot to close the tarp above the pool overnight, it would dawn filled with frogs and toads of all shapes and form. There was this tall, massive poodle dog that resembled a small tank, territorial and fierce, after guarding our piece of land in the jungle for a couple of years, it became a blooded warrior that would lay waste to 1 or 2 snakes every night.\n\nWelp, it was scary but fun. Until this. Once we visited a bunny farm and each of us (me, bro and sis) got a bunny to raise. We spent the week happily bonding with the new pets - when the weekend arrived and we were let out from classes, the entire family drove out to the farmhouse. Friday to Saturday - overnight, 1 out of 3 bunnies went missing.\nTerribly sad, my sister (6) and I (8) asked mom about it. Mom told little sister that the bunny fell in love with a wild forest bunny and ran off to get married - little sister believed her. I was a little brat and refused to swallow that down, so I pestered mom the entire day to allow me to venture into the woods Indiana Jones style to find that naughty bunny.\n\nOf course the least thing mom wanted was for a 6 and 8 years old girls who could easily get lost inside potentially deadly woods to go headlessly into it. So after a while of failing to dissuade me, she let out a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù that little sister wasn‚Äôt allowed to know. Actually, a wolf dug under the fence and ate the bunny... (thank you mother for the nightmares) so she didn‚Äôt want me to go look for it least I be eaten as well.\n\nI barely slept, terrified. Saturday to Sunday - the other 2 bunnies are also gone. Mom perpetuated the lie that they were eaten by wolves and I was so scared of the farmhouse that I refused to ever step foot on it again - after a while of ruined weekends filled with tantrums, dad gave the house to his ex-wife as part of their nuptials agreement in exchange for something else - we never saw that house again!\n\nYears later, I can‚Äôt remember how old I was really, we were together as a family and going over old picture albums. The farmhouse came up, and I figured sister was old enough to know the truth and told her the sad ending of the bunnies. Sister was very obviously just as terrified as I was. That day, mom briskly pulled me aside and confined an even harder truth.\n\nThe one who killed the bunnies was actually my little brother. He was 4 at the time, and was playing with the bunnies without sister and I to supervise him. He grabbed his bunny by the neck and accidentally strangled it. After seeing the unmoving bunny, he went crying to mom who fabricated the elope story to sooth innocent little bro‚Äôs conscience that he didn‚Äôt kill the poor thing! ‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs asleep! Tomorrow you can play some more‚Äù - then quickly bury the dead bunny during the night and pretend it eloped with a wild bunny and ran off.\n\nBro went to play with the other 2 bunnies and accidentally killed them as well... (just HOW WAS HE PLAYING WITH THE POOR THINGS?!) so mom perpetuated the lie to my younger siblings while I knew the grizzly ‚Äútruth‚Äù.\n\nShe purposely scared me so I wouldn‚Äôt be reckless and risk something poisonous or venomous from sticking to me if I charged into the woods... but I was scared into OCD by that. For years! To the point I refused to set foot into any kind of nature for a long while and had to deal with a compulsion for cleanliness (more out of a sense of paranoia that everything was out to get me).\n\nWhen I learned the real truth, that my little brother accidentally killed the bunnies, instead of soothing me, I gained another trauma... it flares up even 20 years later as I refuse to let him close to my pets.",

I didn't care much at all, it was 2002 and everyone's parents were divorcing or already divorced and I don't think I fully understood the weight of it. \n\nAnyway, my dad moved us out to Seattle to an apartment which was cool and all, but when my mom bought a house nearby suddenly my dad was having my brother and I come stay at hotels with him. I thought it was sick, I learned the word \"staycation\" from these weekends spent at various Red Lion Hotels. We would get snacks, watch TV, order pizza, it was really fun. As we got older, my brother and I would get our own rooms on these weekend staycations and get into pre-teen shenanigans. \n\nBut just last week, I saw my brother and we got to talking about our dad who was recently given 6 months to live. As it turns out, our \"staycations\" were the result of our dad drinking away his life savings and not being able to rent a house, let alone buy one. Those weekends were the only good memories I had with our dad, given he was a horribly abusive drunk, and they were suddenly just as spoiled as the rest of my childhood. \n\nGod bless my mother though, she did absolutely everything she could to make sure we were okay and at least one of us more or less landed on their feet. We're having dinner tomorrow just 2 weeks before I move across the country and I don't think I'll miss anyone more than her.",

This bombshell was dropped on me after graduating. Sister held granddaughter emotionally hostage from my mom and mom attempted suicide. Sister knew she was gonna and didnt care before or after. Mom lived.\n Also, grandma was realtor and made money by stealing jewelry from houses she was selling for ppl. Discovered after death. Oo also at funeral my uncle refused to go inside and found out that 30 yrs ago grandma sold his house for him and kept majority.\n\nDad cheated on mom before marriage with her best friend (married at 17/18), forgave him, and cheated on her with >2 other ppl before having kids at around 30-35 (all of these instances my mom knew and forgave). Even had a court case against him for sexual harassment (he was a manager) and that got thrown out. Mom ignored. Had a few more affairs with secretaries, employees etc (after kids)\n\nHe was also about to go surgery for a brain tumor and wanted a clear conscience and told her abt more cheating. Hes like pls hope I make it out of surgery and she like I hope you die fuck you. Ignores doctor recovery reccomendation and has permanent garbage recovery. Basically we had to take care of this suicidal toddler all throughout my 6-12+freshman college. The later years became more aggressive and I had to physically mediate arguments. \n\nA series of physical fights and family running away (for days-wks) and coming back over yrs. Mom dropped this on me as I graduated college and was like I promised myself I'd leave after you graduate so you could grow up in a whole family house.... a man recently took interest in me at work and I think I'm going to leave and live with him. He loves me but I feel bad what should I do? I'm like first of all i shouldnt be born, second of all you shoulda left before marriage, second of all gtfo if you have the option hes lower than dog shit. \n\nSide note, although I was sheltered from this, my sister got updates throughout life and accepted and loved my dad somehow still.\n\nShe leaves, finds adjustment hard after a 40 yr marriage. Her only joy is seeing her first new granddaughter. Sister disagrees with how my mom left and withheld her kid from seeing grandma as an emotional hostage. Between a brutal adjustment in the new house, permanent damage with relationships in the old house, and emotional hostage, mom called me one morning casually saying she has acute liver failure and to gather the family at the hospital. Had to go to Northwestern ICU Transplant Ward to recover in Chicago. Eventually confides to me that it was my sisters fault and she even told my sister she might kill herself and my sister gave no fucks.... INCLUDING when the nurses were trying to get full story because its chemically confirmed basically that it was an OD. I'm always on good terms with both sides of any argument and had the whole story pieced together and told nurse thankfully...\n\nShe lived happily ever after but man that was a fucked up time.\n\nAlso when my dads parents died back to back, my grandma >75, was a realtor and was always having a rough time financially and I was wondering how they were afloat financially. They found that when she had control over lived in houses, shed go in and steal their jewelry while they were gone and stashed it in a false bottom drawer. Also it's an unconfirmed rumor that my alcoholic uncle pushed her down the stairs to kill her..... but her official death was heart attack at top of stairs....\n\nOo also at funeral my uncle refused to go inside and found out that 30 yrs ago grandma sold his house for him and kept majority.",

A few years ago, when I was 27, my mother rang me (we are not close and usually only catch up on birthdays/Xmas), so I thought a grandparent had died or something. \n\nTurns out she said a guy got in contact with her that was her first born, who she gave up for adoption because she was 16. The father wasn‚Äôt my father, just some random school mate of hers. (I don‚Äôt have contact with my dad anyway, haven‚Äôt for 15years).\n\nSo for 27 years of my life, I had an older brother out there in my small country somewhere, that my mother, aunties, uncles and grandparents kept from me. To be honest, with my non-contact with my father, I could‚Äôve really used an older male in my life.\n\nAnyway, turns out he‚Äôs got 7 children to 5 different women. He settles down for a few years and then (probably because of how he was raised or a mental illness), freaks out and disappears. I got in contact with him, turns out he lived only 4 hours from me. \n\nMe and my wife went to meet him, and his (current) partner and kids, he looked a hell of a lot like me, we got on really well with a lot in common, too. I got to meet 2 of my nieces, and it was really, really great. We kept in contact often after that.\n\nThen a few months later, he did what he always does, had a breakdown and fled, and I haven‚Äôt heard from since (about 7~ years ago).\n\nSo, somewhere out there I have an older half-brother, and multiple nieces and nephews that I‚Äôll never know. \n\nWhen people ask me about it all, I just shrug and say ‚Äòeasy come, easy go.‚Äô\n\n\nThanks for reading, sorry for issues I wrote this on mobile.",

            "text": "I've never told this story to anyone, but I doubt anyone will read this anyway so I'm gonna go ahead. I's gonna be long.\n\nMy father died when I was seven years old, after a super bitter and contentious divorce from my mother. We never went to his funeral. To this day (I'm 36 now), I've never even visited my father's grave, but that's something I will fix soon, I hope. My siblings and I were told by my mother that we were abused and unwanted by my dad and his new wife, so just before he died he sent us away so he could enjoy his life without us and with his new wife and son, my step brother who was just a baby at the time. I bitterly hated my father for decades for doing this to us - cruelly sending us away to be impoverished and abused by my mother. My mom told us stories about how he would leave us outside during the winter if we did anything wrong and only fed us a small can of beans or a hot dog for all three of us kids, while giving his other son all the best food and toys and stuff. I couldn't remember anything, so I took her word for it. It was ironic in hindsight, she talked about how abusive he was and then she would turn around and leave us alone for months on end to fend for ourselves while she was vacationing with friends, or beat us with tree branches and pipes, or tell us we were her biggest regret in life. Thank God for my older sister, without her I'd be dead right now. Anyways.\n\nFive years ago I was getting married, and wanted to bury the hatchet with my little brother. So I found him on Facebook and started talking with him, and we all reconciled. None of it was his fault after all, he was only a baby. \n\nWhen he flew out to see us, we started talking with him about our abusive jerk of a father, and he was sincerely confused. As it turns out, after the divorce, my mother (for lack of a better term) seduced a very expensive lawyer into suing my father for custody of us, essentially legally kidnapping us through the system. My father was a very poor southern man and couldn't afford any high-powered attorneys. We found out that not only was everything we knew about my father a lie, but he fought tooth and nail until the day he died trying to get us back, or to at least see us again. We didn't attend his funeral because (of course) they didn't want my mother there. My paternal grandparents and my step mother (who is a very kind and wonderful woman, by the way) tried to get us kids to attend it, but my mother wouldn't let us. She told us my dad said in his will he didn't want us there, which is absurd in hindsight. He died suddenly of a heart attack and had no time to write a will banning his kids from his funeral. Anyway, we found out my dad tried to send us mail, gifts, voicemails... and none of it ever got to us because my mom intercepted and destroyed it all. My dad loved and missed us intensely, up until the moment he died. My step mom kept court documents, photos, letters, home movies... all proof of his devotion to us in the hopes that one day we could reconcile.\n\nSometimes I think about it, like what must have been going through his head when he was dying. Did he think about us? Did he see me specifically? Did he feel like he failed by not getting us back and now he'll never see us grow up? Did he die so young of a heart attack because of the stress my mom put him through by taking us away? If he knew the horrible things we thought about him, he would have been crushed. I spent so much time being manipulated into hating my father that I don't even really miss him. It feels good to know my dad loved me, but it doesn't change anything now. I can't call him when I need advice. I can't talk to him about marriage problems or repairing my car. It's the same as its ever been. I'm just numb to it, and I think that's the saddest thing.\n\nI don't know if there is a heaven or afterlife or whatever, but I hope somehow he knows I'm sorry for thinking that way about him and that I would give anything to be able to talk to him a little bit, or feel what his hug is like.",

They snuck out of camp and walked for 2 weeks until they could sneak through the border and hitch a ride home on a train.\n\nFor some reason we needed to be \"old enough\" to hear this, but ever since whenever the question of \"would you fight for your country?\" comes up around a campfire with my friends or climbing partners (some of them are big patriots), I always tell them that should I ever get drafted in WW3, my only military aspiration is to reach the highest rank my great grandpa did: a deserter.",

My grandpa raised her son like his own, they had 3 boys (of which my grandpa was the father, including my dad) and had over 60 years of a happy marriage before they passed.\nI found this out after my grandpa passed. I think it's incredible from him to do this for my grandma and find it especialy beautiful that they grew in love over time.",

To avoid the shame of an adulterous relationship becoming common knowledge and to avoid the shame of having a child out of wedlock it appears that Mrs Bee and Mr Norman continue to live together but give Master Bee the middle name ‚ÄúNorman‚Äù. As far as anyone would know, Master Bee was fathered by Mr Bee. Master Bee is my great great great (and so on) grandfather. \n\nThe best part?

Growing up, we were told that was 3 dads: 3 older brothers from the first guy, me from my dad, then two younger brothers from the 3rd guy...\n\nNay-nay. [TL:DR at end]\n\nIt all started when I asked my mom, years after my parents divorced, to tell me how she met my dad. She said, ‚Äúhe was an officer and (my oldest brother) had gone too far from the house and (my dad) brought him home in the police car.‚Äù They got to talking and he eventually met her off-duty and asked her out, then they dated for ‚Äúawhile‚Äù before he asked her to marry him. I said, what‚Äôs awhile? ‚ÄúOh, about a year-and-a-half,‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt think twice until later. I knew I was in my mom‚Äôs womb at the wedding, but dear God I hope I can tell this clearly.\n\nMy two oldest brothers (39 & 38) look exactly alike, but my next older brother (33) doesn‚Äôt. Found out 3rd brother was from guy #2 and that guy #1 was distantly related to my mom, and she wasn‚Äôt told by my grandma until after 2nd brother. My grandma knew guy #1 was cousins with my mom and didn‚Äôt say anything. \n\nMy mom wanted more kids but didn‚Äôt want kids with guy #1, so she met guy #2. She told him she was pregnant with 3rd brother, but he didn‚Äôt want a baby and left. Now my dad met my mom shortly after when she knew she was pregnant with 3rd brother, but she didn‚Äôt tell my dad ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm a few weeks pregnant, the guy literally just left.‚Äù\n\nShe started showing and my dad was so excited, he thought the kid was his. My mom told me once that she considered letting him think the baby was his but couldn‚Äôt go through with it. She ended up telling him, and my dad broke up with her, because why not just say that from the beginning? At this point, she decided 3 kids on her own was not what she ‚Äúwanted‚Äù, so she started working toward adopting the baby after he was born.\n\nI guess my dad just needed to process because my mom and my dad still talk through her pregnancy and she tells him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm adopting the baby once he‚Äôs born.‚Äù My mom gives birth to 3rd brother July 1987 and my parents are married October 1987. I‚Äôm born June 1988.\n\n(3rd brother was adopted to family in Alaska, and it was an open adoption. I knew 3rd brother growing up and thought it was normal for people to have brothers being raised somewhere else until I was school age.)\n\nHere‚Äôs the shitty part:\nMy dad offered to raise all 3 older brothers as his own but his mom, my lovely unƒçi whom I adored with all my heart, told my dad that he and my mom needed a ‚Äúfresh start‚Äù and that ‚Äú(my mom) has already started the adoption process, just let her do this then marry her and have a child of your own.‚Äù My older brother (33) and I are 11 months and 7 days apart, and I believed everything my mom told me until trying to put together the pieces. My two oldest brothers (38&39) were given my last name, and my dad adopted and raised them.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry, but that‚Äôs not all. I swear I‚Äôm almost done.\n\nNow, my parents made it til I was about 4 1/2 years old then they were divorced (finalized December 1992). My younger brother was born December 1993, so within 3 months after the divorce, my mom was pregnant and married guy #3 in February 1995 and was married to him til his death in 2014. Last brother was born January 1996... \n\nNow, 3rd brother and 5th brother look EXACTLY alike, 4th brother looks nothing like the rest of us. Found out last brother was guy #2‚Äôs kid after my auntie told me, ‚Äúoh yeah, (guy #2) came back all right, came back after your mom was married and had a bad fight with your stepdad.‚Äù\n\nTL:DR\nGuy #1: oldest brothers (38&39)\nGuy #2: older brother (33)\nMy dad: me (32)\nGuy #4: younger brother (28)\nGuy #2: youngest brother (26)",

I dont remember what led to that but the cops showed up and basically told us that my dad would go to jail and we would all be taken away. I was terrified. So my dad promised to never hit us and my sister never called the cops again. He never hit us. However due to this traumatic incident, he was never really there for us anymore either. He went to work, came home, ate and went out with friends but stopped interacting with the entire family. He was just there. But he raised her from when she was an infant so idk what happened that led to the animosity between them..\n\nWhen I was about 10, i found out my grandparents from my dads side arent biologically related to any of us. They adopted my dad, his blood sister and roughly eight other kids that had no relation to each other. When they immigrated to the US, families wanted a better life for their kids so they begged my grandparents to take them because they couldnt go. \n\nWhen I was roughly 16 or so, I found out my grandpa from my mom's side had a girlfriend. She was living with my grandpa and grandma. My grandma couldnt do anything but be depressed and just deal with it.\n\nWhen I was 21 I found out that my grandfather from my mom's side was also not blood related to us.

The exchanged words when they had to (like when sorting out bills, post, telling each other that someone is calling the other person). They used separate parts of the fridge, cooked separate meals, did separate shopping etc. The only time they came together was during Christmas and Easter. Nobody knows what happened. I should also mention that they have been married since 20s (if I remember correctly my grandpa was 26-7 and grandma 20), I guess they remained married because of their strongly religious views and family. \n\n3 years ago my grandpa passed away mid September, and grandma followed at the beginning of December same year. I like to think (probably not true but it brings me a whole lot of comfort when thinking about them) that even though they lived their separate lives, they loved each other and my nan passed away because of broken hear syndrome and now they're back together (probably not speaking still).",

I found out because the affair lady turned up at Grandmas house two years ago looking for money...\n\nThen I found out that my Mum had an affair with my real dad while they were both married, they had to shot gun wedding to have me which led to the discovery that my real Dad is not actually my Dad... I don't know who my Dad is now but it turns Mum and 'Dad' got a divorce because they both consistently cheated on each other... definitely not the story I was told growing up.\n\nMy Mother accused my Grandad of raping her when she was a teenager, this caused a huge rift in the family, understandably. After much discussion with my Grandma I find out that my mother told everyone I said Grandad raped me and only told me it was her... nobody talks to my Mum anymore, she's mental. \n\nI start doing some genealogy work because my grandmother doesn't know too much about her Dad and wants to find more, cool, will give me something to do in a pandemic. So I go digging into Great Grandad and find out his mum isn't his mum. He was born illegitimately to the woman he called Aunty and raised to believe he was his Grandmas son and last child. His now Grandma and not Mum packed him off to live with a woman in a close by village (haven't found out who she is yet) and that his biological Mum also possibly had an illegitimate girl who I also can't trace. \n\nI also find out that while said Great Grandad of strange origin was away during the war his wife had a baby with someone else and that baby was adopted away because he couldn't cope with the baby even though he tried really hard to love it like his own, he just couldn't. Props to this Great Grandad, I like him and he had a shite life he did not deserve.\n\nTo keep this kinda brief, I also then found out that my Grandmas sister actually married her cousin which isn't illegal but oh my god did we need any more weirdness? She also kept the family bible and her daughter has fudged dates and names in it to avoid letting everyone know she's kind of an incest baby and I can't say I blame her tbh.\n\nI don't think I missed anything but I probably have tbh, at least I'm laughing because I'm not that bad!",

He doesn‚Äôt know how to act as a father and has a hard time showing his emotions and is just a flawed human being in general (alcoholic, koleric and slightly racist), if he had told me earlier maybe I could have understand where he is coming from a bit better, there is also more to the story after my grandfather died of how my grandmother treated him that I don‚Äôt want to go into but that was surely very traumatic for him as well. \n\nBut everytime he insists of buying me something or even tries to talk me into letting buy something outrageous I let him (we do have the means too btw) because I know that‚Äôs how he says I love you and I never get to hear it otherwise.",

I remember how upset my mom was when she found out that I had stayed at my grandma's house overnight while he was sleeping there and I never understood why. He taught me how to play the piano and ride a bike, what could he have possibly done to make my mom hate him?\n\nTen years later, the truth comes out. My uncle had exposed himself to my mom and tried to molest her when she was younger. My family never went to the police or \"got him help\" or anything. My grandma and a select few uncles and aunts KNEW this happened and still keep in contact with him. It's extra disgusting considering I am the daughter of the niece he tried to molest when she was younger.\n\n2nd story: My aunt always makes snide comments about anything and everything having to do with children. She talks about never wanting to have children ever. Turns out, my aunt became pregnant when she was sixteen and my great grandma gave her two options: keep the baby and leave her house, or put the baby up for adoption and stay in the house. Aunt chose the latter. We've made attempts to find the baby, but we've had no luck (happened sometime in the late 1960s-early 1970s and it was a closed adoption).",

            "text": "After reading through this thread, I have come to the conclusion that those soap operas on TV are actually not nearly as farfetched as people think they are.  The truth really IS stranger than fiction.\n\n When I was 16, I finally began to understand where my life began.  I believe I saw a framed picture of my mother and father's marriage certificate, and did the math. The math didn't add up.  As I got older and started going through puberty, I noticed my mother was extremely strict about me being out unsupervised, being around boys, being out after dark, etc.   My parents were just super strict about me having any type of freedom, especially my mom.  \n\nI remember standing in the doorway of my bedroom.  My mom was in the hallway that went down toward her room.   I had just figured out that my mom had gotten married in April, but I was born in October, which meant that she was pregnant when she got married to my dad. By the time I figured this out, I was the oldest of 5 kids already.  \n\nI said something to my mom, I don't remember what, but I just remember saying out loud, that's why you hate me so much.  The shocked look on her face, when she realised the dark family secret was finally out, was a look I had never seen before.   She was utterly stunned, and didn't really know what to say. I think she was entirely unprepared for this moment.  \n\nMom had always treated me differently than the other kids. She was really hard on me, she rejected me often, acted as if I deserved nothing, she never told me that she loved me once when I was growing up, and she just treated me like I owed her something.  She also got jealous if other friend's moms were kind to me, showed me attention, doted on me in any way, or tried to buy me shoes or any nice thing (which I desperately needed).   When these things would happen, they would just push me further down into darkness. I couldn't understand why every little ray of light that would come into my life, every little bit of happiness, she would just snuff it out and take it away for me. Always treating me as if I wasn't worth spoiling in any way.  I got really good grades, I stayed out of trouble, I took good care of all my siblings, I did the cooking and cleaning, etc.   I spent a lot of time trying to earn the love that I didn't get. That's obviously not a healthy way to grow up.  It did lead at the time to me having emotional issues and eating disorders, and worse.    I had no idea back then that I had any worth, and I had no idea about what was healthy or unhealthy, I just knew that anytime I spoke up about the things that I saw that were just completely wrong in our household or family, I would get abused - they would make sure that I shut up quick.  \n\n I do remember age 15, It was when my father and mother were starting to go through the beginning of breaking up. My dad had shipped myself and my sister to my maternal grandmother's house, in taken my 3 other siblings to his own parents house, 3 blocks away.  I remember it was as if my higher self was acknowledging that something was going really wrong, and the things that were going wrong were about to seal my fate.   I believe this was right before I started having the eating disorders. It was as if there was a shift happening and I felt it, and I felt a deep sadness knowing that I was being damaged, and it was a little too late to turn back.   It was as if I was grieving for the person I could have been, if I had only been loved.  I was actually very fortunate though, that I had been sent to my grandmother's house, because over the next four years, she gave me so much love and acceptance and treated me as if I was someone that was wanted to have around.   I ate up that I love and attention like the thirsty soul that I was.   It didn't fix me, that took time and lots of therapy, and just a change of household when I turned 18, that definitely helped.  But my grandmother gave me the example of what it's like to love a child, and that is what I drew from when I had my own children. I can imagine what I would have done without her. God really provided something important for me come up at the 11th hour of my childhood crisis.  \n\n Later on down the road, I found out more details - that my mother, who was raised by my closed up, proud fifties housewife grandmother, had gotten knocked up by my dad on a date. They had been going out for not sure how long.  My dad took my mom to park at Griffith park in Los Angeles. It was late at night and my mom was very inexperienced.  She is honestly still quite a prude, and she claimed that she knew pretty much nothing about sex.  This was back in the sixties, her father had died when she was only 10.   She felt as if what happened to her was date rape, that my dad basically forced himself on her.  She is very resentful, to this day, never had therapy, but meds have helped.  \n\n So, back to the pregnancy... my mom got pregnant, and immediately there was an uproar in the family. My grandmother threw her out of the house, completely mortified and embarrassed that my mother had gotten herself in this situation. My mom was only 17 and probably quite traumatised, had to go stay at my dad'swith his folks.  And my dad's parents, I am sure they weren't too thrilled with it either. My grandmother used to have a really hard time dealing with my dad's behaviour issues. My aunts told me that my father, her older brother, used to be so much trouble that her mom had to quit her job in stay home, because after school he would raise hell around the house.\n\nSo, years later, my mom was diagnosed with  depression, fibromyalgia, severe PMS, all kinds of mood issues.  Made sense, as she has a rep for being an emotionally immature nightmare to be around a good deal of the time, anyway.  I just remember she yelled, yelled a lot, and when she would yell, my dad would start swinging on us to make her happy.   That, coupled with going to church a lot, seem to be the only parenting skills that they possessed.  She was always good in emergencies, and if there was some type of craft project involved in a task, but the day to day was absolutely not anything that interested her.  That was left to me, or nobody.   I honestly used to wish someone would come rescue as. We always looked like the perfect little family at church, but behind closed doors, it was pure misery.\n\nAnd what makes it worse, is that my dad was not at all normal himself. I believe that he was born with some type of neurological issue. He never knew how to be appropriate, he didn't understand boundaries very well, and his behaviour and words showed that.  He was often indecent, and this led to a lot of scandal in future years.   He is currently on his 5th wife, although some of the scandal also in involved his stepdaughter, and other things, I won't go into it.   He and his 5th wife have been off and on, but now that they are both getting older, they are trying to work it out just because it's hard to be alone in your old age.\n\nI will say that my parents have calmed down some, they have realised some of their mistakes, altho more my mom than my dad.  Ironically, there is a best selling teen novel, by a woman who knew my brother in grade school, based on some of the trauma of our childhood, and the issues my dad caused my brother.   He is my closest sibling,  has more trauma (really bad stuff) than pretty much a lot of people I've ever known.    But honestly, now he's gone on to bring that trauma into his own family with his own kids, even though he's a wonderful person and he does amazing things with his kids, and always helping out others, incredibly bright.  He is finally sober, but the damage is done.  His children now have the issues children of alcoholics face.   My point is, we can sit and point fingers at \"the bad guy\" who messed it up all day long, but in the end we are all human.  The point, really, is figuring out how to make ourselves better, not figuring out what is wrong with others.  \n\nThere is always going to be someone that was affected by the dysfunctional people that screwed them up, and so on and so forth.  Breaking the cycle is all that matters now, healing and restoration.",

(2) I don't want him to think that there are any family secrets we've kept from him, that we trust him. (3) I want him to know that there is always someone to talk to no matter how bad things get.\n\nA therapist I know said that I should wait until he asks questions or becomes more curious about my father.

Buying new clothes, feeding her meals, even getting her on vacations with the family that she didn't attend herself because she hates traveling. \n I had never understood their marriage because grandma is an extremely devout catholic and grandpa was a militant atheist from an early age. It turned out that because of this relationship she was labeled a \"bad girl\" and no catholic guy would marry her. Why my grandfather agreed to the marriage I have no idea.",

My dad also comes over for other errands he needs help with. The day that the above happened (and after he left), my mom and I were both talking about some things he'd done to us. I remember saying to her at one point, \"isn't that just emotional abuse\", and her quietly replying \"yeah, I've heard it called that.\" She went on to say she'd seen a few red flags before I was even born.\nOver the next few days I asked some people I trusted about my situation. They'd seperately come to the same conclusions that he was mean and intimidating (one even called his abuse out), and after opening up about my experiences I knew that he'd definitely hurt me too. \nSome examples being: Walking on eggshells around him, I was guilt-tripped anytime I wanted to hang out with friends or go to a study session for school, he was angry towards things that didn't warrant it, everyone including me was held to strict standards (not just in school), if I did something wrong he would scold me and/or threaten to take my things away (Getting scolded/yelled at really hurts me), he would frequently remind me that he would miss me when I wasn't at home, dismissed my feelings when I was sad, shut down conversations he didn't want to have, got upset when I didn't want to talk about things upsetting me or in general, and more.\nI haven't been okay since I realized how toxic he is. I used to really admire his intelligence and wanted to be just like him, but for the foreseeable future, he lost most of my respect. All my life I've seen him as a constant source of anxiety, but it was only about 3 weeks ago that I finally understood why. Also for him to abuse not only me, but my mother for so long was the final fucking straw. On a brighter note, since I'm 18, I can get the hell out and live with my mom for a while.

I knew he was an angry person, depressed and overall difficult to deal with especially as he aged.  I got mad at her and also said somethings I'm not proud of.\n\nFast forward a year and after months of vertigo and terrible nausea my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer.  She had small tumors in her brain and one in particular was causing the vertigo.  She went through years of surgery, radiation, chemo, keytruda, and experimental medicine.  She passed after a few years when she was given 6 months to live.\n\nAnyway, the secret is my mother confided in me that she regrets staying with my father.  I had no idea how miserable she felt for decades.  I knew it wasn't great but I moved out at 18.  She always seemed content and was a silver linings type of person.  She spent her last few years with someone she had terrible anxiety with, who disrespected her, who was nasty to her.  \n\nAfter she died my father talked as if she were an angel, which she was, but also made it like he did so much for her and was the greatest husband.   I took her to her doctor's appoints, almost daily, I did the hard things when someone stays in their home during hospice.  The fact is he did nothing except complain and literally blame her for her cancer.\n\nRecently my extended family got together and my father was doing the usual poor me, I was the greatest husband speel.  I couldn't take hearing it one more time while I stayed silent.  So I said some of the things she told me out loud.  First I said it almost as a cliff note, not quite under my breath.  Like oh was that when you threw your dinner across the room when she couldn't get out of bed.  Or was that when you would enter the room and my mother would get so anxious that she would get physical ill?  Then it started to just flow out and I started remembering why I left the house at 18.  \n\nAnyway, I aired most of what she said to me infront of most of my family.  It was therapeutic and very surprising to most.  I haven't spoken to my father in about a year and it will stay that way for a long time.  In a way, I'm the continuation of what my mother always wanted to do.",

So they borrowed that amount of money to rent properties for business like karaoke or bars and stuff, well unfortunately it never worked for them considering that their business was shut down due to people doing drugs in karaoke and ofc drugs in general are illegal in my country. So in the end they were left with a huge amount of debt over debt, and the last thing I know that it‚Äôs a matter of time before they are evicted from their own home... Having known the past of my childhood friend, it really breaks my heart but it will never changes how I treat him as a close friend... if anything I wish that things will be better for him",

Unbeknownst to my mother as well, go figure. Took me a while to tell my mom, can‚Äôt recall exactly how long. I think it was a couple years though. She seemingly took it very well, and didn‚Äôt seem surprised. However she knew my father much much better than us kids did, so I gathered it went along with his ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù, if that is even a proper description for what I would imagine a enormous ‚Äúlack there of said character‚Äù. So years later, my sister (4 years younger) had been corresponding with our half sister, whom my brother and I still hadn‚Äôt had any interaction with at all. My sis informed me that this mystery sister wanted to attempt some kind of whatever with my brother and myself. I only say ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù, because when I called the number provided by my sis, to try and chat with this new older sibling that I was excited to try and get to know.. she didn‚Äôt answer, so I left a voicemail. Weeks later, still no response back. Not even a text. I mean seriously, she had initiated an attempt at contact through word of mouth (through my sis), yet didn‚Äôt even care to chat on the phone.. red flag. I honestly can‚Äôt recall what my sister said her (mystery half sis, MHS to simplify) issue was. It‚Äôs been so long since then, around 10 years. I think she said something like our MHS would like to correspond via emails before she would consider talking on the phone. Although she had no problem talking on the phone to my FBS (full blood sis). Red flag two. At this point I didn‚Äôt care enough any longer to entertain this mystery sisters wishes. It had been 30+ years that she had the opportunity to get in some kind of contact with us, yet she hadn‚Äôt. I was truly bummed at this point also, because I always had a feeling I had at least one sibling out there I had never met, or even knew of. Go figure, I was right. Apparently this woman (so unimportant to me I cannot remember her name) has a family with a couple kids. Nephews/ nieces I‚Äôll probably never meet.. unfortunately for all of us. A brother in law, in the like. Which I very honestly don‚Äôt care to meet whatsoever (in-laws, lol). It‚Äôs really just sad to me that she would make a half ass attempt at correspondence, and give up over not wanting to speak on the phone. Is that petty or what? Maybe I‚Äôm being petty, ‚Äòcause I didn‚Äôt want to email her, after my voicemail was essentially ignored/disregarded? Nonetheless wouldn‚Äôt most folks feel kinda rejected put in the same situation? Or geeze, maybe she‚Äôs really that shy..? Which is super hard to believe, because shyness definitely does not run in the family. Oops, I did leave out a pretty pertinent piece of information. We (my brother and myself) haven‚Äôt spoken to our sister in years, probably around 10 for me, not sure how long for him. I‚Äôve messaged her here and there, including responses from her...haha. We just don‚Äôt have Jack in common, live very far away from each other, and live completely different lives. I‚Äôve had an affinity for drugs over the years, used to have an extremely bad alcohol problem (almost two years sober), but was always nice and protective of my sis growing up. My brother on the other hand, who still struggles with alcoholism, treated her like shit growing up. So I don‚Äôt really see the reasoning for her almost completely cutting me out of her life.. him, I don‚Äôt blame her.. it‚Äôs been going on a year he and I haven‚Äôt spoken either. Damn egos I tell ya! Ha. This ‚Äúwoman‚Äù, my sister, didn‚Äôt even invite our mother to her wedding! Let alone her only brothers... Talk about a grudge.. I swear I didn‚Äôt leave anything out either, as to why she would feel so inclined to pretty much disown us. Anyways, where I‚Äôm getting at with all this sister background info is: The only thing I can guess is that she told our half sister a bunch of crap that she didn‚Äôt even need to know, if she wanted to establish some kind of relationship with two siblings (my brother and I) that she had never, and still hasn‚Äôt met. Or even heard each others voices.. damn! That‚Äôs pretty sad actually when I step away and look at it as I‚Äôm writing all this. I mean I knew we had a very dis functional family, but wow! If there was a contest we‚Äôd almost guaranteed win some awards lol. I‚Äôve considered asking for homgirls (half sisters) email time and again, but I know that if she wanted to know me at all, or at least apart from the ‚Äúlovely‚Äù picture my stuck up sister has painted for her, then she would have made an effort. Personally I would like to find out for myself about a long lost family member, regardless of what I had heard. I could make those assumptions/decisions well on my own. Who knows, we could have tons in common, and get along wonderfully? I have a feeling we‚Äôll never know though. Sad ending. Please feel free to let me know what you‚Äôd do in my shoes. Comments are more than welcome too. Create a wonderful day!                                          \n    I just remembered, and have to add: I found out years after the original info about my promiscuous father; he started another family after he left my mother on my 6th birthday (that was actually the last time any of us saw him, sure they split much before that, but whatever right). So apparently I have more, younger now. half siblings running around the Midwest somewhere. That who knows if they have any inkling of his previous promiscuity, and if my brother, sister, half sister, or myself even exist. Not like it would matter really, once again. Too bad talk shows like Geraldo aren‚Äôt big anymore. Because I could totally see a two, maybe even three part episode on all of this aforementioned ridiculousness! Bwhahaha",

            "text": "So my family was very active and prominent in the Lakewood, CA community. My great grandparents actually owned several plots before houses were built and made a killing flipping/remodeling the houses after being built (1949-1950, so imagine that kind of money today). Over time, my great Grandparents (we'll just refer to them as GG's) house became the \"hub\" for babies and teens to be abandoned there and my great grandparents would just raise them or help find families to raise them. There was actually a scandal about baby swapping between housewives during that time. \n\nAnyway, because of that, my GG's became very in tune with the neighborhood and getting to know everyone who moved in nearby. My grandpa lived in the house next door to them, so my mom and her brother were practically raised in that house too. Across the street from them was \"Omar\" (I think he uses reddit so I won't use his real name) and his parents. He was about 5-6 years older than my mom. Omar and his family became very close with mine very quick. Not in a weird, creepy, \"I want to see what you have inside your house\" way either. Like we're still friends with their family to this day. \n\nWhen my mom was a teen, she really struggled because my GG's spoiled her and all the kids. Outside of flipping houses, my Great Grandpa was one of the head bosses at Firestone in South Africa before my mom was born in 1972. I think they got back to the states in 1969-1971. So needless to say they were well off enough to spoil any kids. Because of this, her parents weren't really sure what to do so they almost treated it like a lost cause situation until my mom was about 15-16. \n\nWhen my mom was that age, her and Omar were in a secret relationship. The guy truly loved my mom and she him, but their age difference made it hard. Cue my mom getting pregnant at 16. And here's the kicker....not with me (I'm her firstborn).\n\nWhen Omar found out, they knew my GG's would have taken the baby to raise so my mom could focus on her life and finish school. While that's not a terrible idea, it really should have been up to the ppl who created said baby. So, yes they told everyone she was pregnant. \n\n\nBut they did it from Mexico where Omar and his family are from. Of course my family were getting ready to go get her. Somehow...my mom calmed them down enough to listen and convinced them to let her stay. She actually thrived out there. Finished high school, learned Spanish fluently. She's already half Mexican but she never learned as a child. \n\nBy the time she was due for the baby, she had a miscarriage :(. Idk the details surrounding it, but my aunt swears my mom was never the same after. She got back to the states about 6 months to a year after the miscarriage. She doesn't know that I know the whole story because I don't want to further her trauma or make her talk about it.",

Her father, now a single parent to a 10 year old boy, My 7 year old Mom, a 4 year old girl, a 2 year old girl and a newborn with Mental Retardation due to lack of oxygen from my grandmother's passing. Being the oldest girl she was a mother to her 3 younger siblings. At age 19 she married my Dad and had her first daughter (my sister) at age 20. At age 21 she got pregnant with me. While 8 months pregnant with me her father passed away from his pancreas bursting. Her 2 younger (teenage) siblings were going to end up in foster homes so my mother took them in. At 21 she now had my 1.5  year old sister, myself a newborn and her 2 teenage sisters. One with disabilities. \nThis caused my Dad to start drinking and gambling to get out of the house.

After a very short time I started doing a lot better so I became confident and comfortable talk king about it. I had a meeting with my mom first of all. That answered a lot of questions for us both. I had a meeting with my 2 sisters after that and I found out they had both been molested by this guy and that he had molested both of his sisters. This made me angry again. After a couple of years of sobriety I got divorced and started drinking again. I was determined to find this guy. It took a really long time but finally found him about a year ago. I also found his son who shares his name and looks just like what I remember of the dad when I was a young boy. They are both in prison for molesting kids.

He even drove out of state for her funeral when she passed away.

This was our life until I was about 8 when bio mother, B, and my step-dad divorced and we stopped seeing her for \"reasons.\" Over the years we have been able to pierce together the weirdness of our parents' relationships..\n\nDad and T married in the early 80s.  He was in the Air Force and was sent to another state for some training and met B, whose father was in the Air Force and stationed at that base.  They had an affair.  Dad and T divorced, Dad and B got married in the mid 80s.  They had my older sister and were pregnant with me when Dad was medically discharged.  They settled in the same town as my maternal grandparents, he worked as an over the road truck driver and she stayed home with us.  At some point- things started getting bad.  B was bipolar and untreated and she didn't take care of us, but my dad didn't know because he was away for work.  One weekend he was home and found a fake wedding invitation she designed for her and her friend's \"wedding,\" and Dad kicked her out.  She moved in with that friend, claimed they were only friends, but they eventually married and divorced.  \n\nMeanwhile, T had moved back home and I guess tried to move on. She dated a friend in their mutual friend circle for several years, but eventually got back in touch with my dad.  After B left, he and T got back together and she moved in with us.  They got remarried a week after the divorce finalized and are still (sometimes happily) married to this day.\n\nB and my step-dad eventually divorced and she was actually hospitalized for a while.  I'm still not sure what the details are there, if the divorce led to a breakdown or what.  My parents didn't let us see her for obvious reasons, and instead of sticking around and trying to fix it she hitched tail and moved to Australia and married her online pen pal.  They're still married, and I haven't spoken to her since we last saw her (so approx. 1996/7).  \n\nSo T is my dad's first and third wife, and if you're wondering if I have problems with having relationships, yes.",

Side fact 2: if you are clearly murdered while \"mentally retarded,\" they not only won't look for your killer, the hospital won't even report it to the police for investigation.)\n\nMy love for my sister was the only reason I had not already been legally adopted by my parents who had taken me in as a teenager, snuck me meals, bought me clothes, had my haircut, and generally taught me how to live & love in every way as normal people do, taught me in every way my birth parents failed.  So I'd been legally adopted for a decade when the doctors asked me to dig into my genetic medical past.  23&Me & [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com) revealed something strange:  lots of connections with my birth mother's maiden name, none with my birth father's last name.  So I dig with my Aunts & Uncles who understand why I left and still talk to me.\n\nTakes me a while to find \\*that Aunt\\* who doesn't just spill tea as I expected, she brewed a whole gallon to dump on the floor and mop with.

My birth father's mother wanted a child, but it wasn't happening:  so she slept with the neighbor's husband and got pregnant.\n\nBut nobody will ever know, right?  It's the 1960s, paternity tests don't exist.  Strange fact: kids from the same father can look alike.  How alike?  At 5 years old the neighbors had a blow up when their kids were clones of each other, they knew they'd cheated, and then my grandparents moved.  How do I know this?  I met my birth father's clone who was literally as if a twin of him.  And he spilled the tea on what he remembered from his parents arguing at 5 and knowing he had a twin in the same town.  He wasn't stupid, but also didn't care to meet whoever this was.  I wanted to see this man again, and explore more about my genetic past beyond him confirming there was no history of seizures he knew of.  Strange thing happened before I could talk to him again... shortly after this meeting, he wrote a note to his wife that said just the words \"Pay the Bills,\" took a shotgun and ended his own life.\n\nI decided this was the end of the line.  I'm not trying to find his family to then explain what he admitted and ask for help while mourning him.  I was hoping to learn the history of my genetic past. I've had to investigate & uncovered infidelity in every area of my adult life (adultery is against military law & investigated as a crime): and if we're honest we know it's all around us.

Unfortunately my mum then decided she didn't want to see her again and my auntie still wants nothing to do with it all as she idolised my grandad and doesn't want to believe he had an affair behind my nan's back.\n\nSo yes, I have an auntie somewhere in my city that I probably have passed many times when shopping.\n\n\n\nAnother family secret that I finally revealed myself after some time, was that my mum's POS 2nd husband (I refuse to call him stepdad) had been beating my sister and me ever since they got married. My mum used to work full time and he would look after us. We would get belts, strangled and God knows what. He even once cut my sister's head open and it needed gluing and he made her lie that she must have done it at school. One day I just couldn't hold it anymore and told my friends mum. She marched me straight round to my aunties house as she lived on the same street and it all went off from there. My mum kicked the POS out and divorced him. When she was clearing out his stuff, they found loads of empty vodka bottles hidden in various places in the house/garden and my Nan and grandad figured out that he had been watering down the alcohol in their liquor cabinet all the times he had watched their house whilst they went away. So not only was he a child beater but an alcoholic too. My mum said we could go to the police but it was entirely up to us and in the end we didn't want to go through that. I regret this to this day as I always think what if he did it to others.",

Like, straight up hate for Italians. \n\nSo I can only assume he realized that his drinking and being a dick to my grandmother, who had 6+ kids to feed at any one point in time, meant that she either had to prostitute to get groceries in the house, or she took a lover when they lived in a majority Italian neighborhood, and that's how my dad, 2 of his brothers and 1 of his sisters have dark curly hair and dark brown eyes when the rest of the kids were blonde or red-heads with blue or gray eyes. \n\nI tell myself that she just fell head over heels for the nice widower down the block and 'taking in washing' didn't mean something a little different.

Eventually my grandma and their 4 kids were able to join him in the US once he earned enough money to get them over. For years he had a private closet behind his chair in the den at their house and I was always told to stay out of it. Curiosity eventually got the most of me and I went in there one day and found a letter from the 1990s that my grandad had received from a lawyer he had out there. It read something along the lines of \"Martin, I would caution you to stay out of Ireland at this time. The authorities have not taken kindly to the 10 cattle you stole along with the 12 sheep. I don't think it wise you visit your mother at this time.\" Kind of sad, but still a pretty interesting part of our family history. I still have the letter.\n\nMy grandpa on my Dad's side supposedly used to work for the mafia in New York as their \"bill collector\". At one point he was forced to move to Canada for about a year.

He installed a wood burning stove in it to keep warm seeing as how this was during the cold wi tee months of Ohio.My aunt who I lived with at the time which was his ex wife allowed me to go stay a few nights with him. I was 15. My uncle had a pig he was givin living outside in a little pen. and he had dug a while to roast it in. One night we are sitting at the table playing cards and he had a friend stop over who was an old native guy. Let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúKenny‚Äù Kenny gave me a very awkward feeling. We had a generator hooked up outside in a shed to use electricity in rare occasions when we needed to charge phones etc. so a few nights go by with Kenny coming over. We play cards, we smoke, and just hangout. One night I was out cutting wood for the wood burning stove while my uncle and Kenny were inside. Probably doing heroin. When Kenny came outside to leave he came up to me and told me how much he loved hanging out with me, but it felt very, predatory, more than he just liked hanging out. Like he wanted me as a small child. Few nights go by and Kenny hasn‚Äôt been over. And late one night my uncle and I were asleep and I woke up to the fire being out. So I went outside to the shed where we also kept the wood for the stove and grabbed some wood. While out there I could‚Äôve sworn I saw a man. In the surrounding woods. This ‚Äúhome‚Äù was located in the middle of some woods. I went and told my uncle and he looked and couldn‚Äôt find anyone. A few nights later my uncle leaves to go to town and I stay and tend to the generator and cut some wood. I hear a crunch and I turn around and it‚Äôs Kenny. He asks if my uncle was there and I told him no. And Kenny said he would wait with me for him to return. He helps me chop wood, the whole time looking at me very weirdly. I always felt creepy around him. We go inside and a little time passes. Kenny tried to take advantage of me. My uncle comes in just in time. He sees what is happening and grabs Kenny. I get away and go sit in a corner crying. My uncle takes him outside and I hear a lot of noise, yelling, fighting, then nothing. About 2 hours pass. And my uncle comes in covered in dirt. He told me I didn‚Äôt have to worry about Kenny ever again.\n\nMy uncle made me swear to never tell anyone this story. But he has passed a few years back.

He'd be gone a few days at a time on various loads/job sites. One day he came home and confessed to his wife (grandma) that he'd had a 3 month long affair with another woman. Grandma was pissed, they fought, they didn't talk for a while... but they eventually made up. Fast forward 20 years, grandpa dies. Fast forward another year and there's a knock at the door. A young, 20 something kid is at the door and asks my grandma \"Does Mr. X Live here?\" She angrily says no and slams the door in his face. My Mother, Aunt, and Uncle have a half sibling out there somewhere that none of them are keen on knowing, as it would be a slap in the face - reminding them of the time their dad cheated on their mom.\n\nNow on my dad's side, we always assumed we were Norwegian. We have Norwegian relatives, we've always had a 'traditional' Norwegian way of doing things. Well, it took my Aunt (dad's sister) to do some digging to find out we actually had French decent. My great, great grandpa lived in France in the early 1900s but had a German sounding last name. When 1939 rolled around, they saw what was coming and immigrated to Canada, however; he changed their last name to something sounding a little more French so as not to be suspected of being a spy. \n\nThen when g g grandpa had a son, he gave him up. Not sure what ever happened to his mom, but Grandpa was taken in by his Aunt and Uncle, and all his cousins then became his step siblings. He tracked down his biodad once and biodad was a total waste of oxygen, so he never went back. It's possible that g g grandpa had another life and more kids, but we'll never know.\n\nThe latest mystery to plague our family, though, was when Grandma on dad's side passed away, my aunt was cleaning out the house and found Grandpa's old military footlocker from the Korean War. In it were the usual things a veteran would have, but at the bottom was a little envelope with some photos inside. The photos were of a young woman, roughly in her 20's-30's, just doing mundane, candid things. Washing dishes, standing in the yard, walking down a snowy road... but then the last 2 pictures threw us all through a loop. The first was of this young woman in a 1 piece swim suit (very racy for the 1950's). The second picture was of this young woman holding an infant, about 8-12months old, with Grandpa's framed military picture on the mantle behind her. This was the only picture that had any writing on it and it only said \"We miss you\". We have no idea who this woman is, who the baby is, or why Grandpa's military photo was in the last one. It's now a possibility that Dad and Auntie have a half sibling out there somewhere. If Grandma knew, she never said anything about it before she passed. If Grandpa had an affair, he never said a word about it either. Just another unknown in life I guess.",

My great-grandmother passed away in 2014, and she may have known about all this, but since he was a well-respected deacon in the church, especially since it consists mainly of relatives, and she was a devout Christian, so she never divorced him. Obviously, I won't ever bash my great-grandfather, especially since he's dead now, but I fully believe that my great-grandmother felt that she was never good enough for him.",

Turned out she did it to ‚Äòseal the deal‚Äô as she liked him so much. She also told him that her parents are rich when in fact they‚Äôre unemployed, poor couple who lived off from their retirement money and are in on her scheme. \n\nThey already had 2 children when my cousin wanted to file a divorce, but his wife was suddenly pregnant with their 3rd child and he couldn‚Äôt bear to leave his baby, so he stayed with her. \n\nThe list of other shitty things she did:\n1. She apparently trained her youngest child to steal from my other cousin‚Äôs and aunt‚Äôs purse. Some of their money were gone and they were sure of it because they literally counted their money individually before visiting my cousin. \n2. She invited her parents to move into my cousin‚Äôs house, which is considered small for 7 people (2 in-laws, my cousin-his wife, 3 children). He has to pay for all the food. \n3. Her divorced sister asked to also move into my cousin‚Äôs house and she let her. When she made up with her husband, the husband also moved in, making it 9 person in a small house. My cousin still has to pay for all the food. \n4. She was constantly in debt and my cousin had to pay it all (one of the reasons he wanted a divorce). After all her debt was paid, she asked for another debt by saying that my cousin‚Äôs aunt was the one who needed the money but was too shy to ask for it herself. My cousin‚Äôs aunt was stopped in her car by debt collectors for debts that she know nothing about. This was the last straw. \n\nHe finally filed for a divorce. But her condition was that she‚Äôd get the custody for all their children as they‚Äôre still young. My cousin couldn‚Äôt bear to let her children to be with their questionable mother so he bought her a car purposely to commute the children to their school etc. Turned out she used it for her own ‚Äòneeds‚Äô and she didn‚Äôt care about her children‚Äôs education whatsoever and sometimes won‚Äôt even take them to school. My niece almost didn‚Äôt pass a grade and had to transfer to an islamic boarding school to ensure her education, which lead her to ran away from school.\n\nMy cousin also has to pay for their children‚Äôs needs (around 75% of his salary IIRC). But because they‚Äôre still underage, all of his money goes to her. Who knows what she does with all the money. \n\nI actually felt sad for him. He‚Äôs now married to a widow with a child and honestly i‚Äôm more concerned how that he has 2 more people to feed.",

She was an absolute character, pub landlord from Glasgow and an absolute legend. My grandfather was from the Czech Republic and died when I was pretty young. I always wished I'd got to know him better but that's life I suppose. I was always proud of the Czech heritage I had growing up.\n\nWhilst clearing out my grans house we were going through some old photos when I found one of my mum when she was young and I remarked upon how she looked like a wee Czech kid to which she replied \"that would be difficult, I'm not Czech\". Turns out my gran was married to someone before and he was my bio grandfather, turns out he was a piece of shit alcoholic who beat my gran, he's dead now and no one knew him or really cared anyways. It just kind of threw me off course a bit. My family are all super close and their is never any secrets so I was shocked to learn this. Without sounding dramatic it gave me a small identity crisis. There's no change as to how great a man my Czech grandad is/was, I'm just a little sad about it.\n\nAnyways, thanks for this thread for letting me speak out what I'm feeling just now.",

She had no contact with the family until my cousin was born ( this happened in the 90s and my family was treated very poorly by the society then.) I kind of knew about this when I was in my pre-teens but my mom never really spoke about this.\nSecond, my grandfather‚Äôs brother got eloped and got married to an actress ( outside of our community obviously). He came home with the bride ( this was in 1950s, super scandalous at that time) and my great-grandmother asked him to leave the house. He, being unemployed and a lazy motherfuxker who was used to mooching off of grandfather dumped his wife and came back home and was forced to remarry another women. \nThird ( now this one I HAD NO FREAKING IDEA), my father‚Äôs cousin sister was a mistress. She was a naive women in her late teen/ early twenties when she had an affair with a married man ( she was working for him, and was apparently manipulated by him) and got pregnant. NOW, this is not acceptable even now so it definitely was a big issue in the 60s. She ended up marrying him and had that child. \n\nNow this may not be as big of a deal for some of you reading this but in my ‚Äúperfect‚Äù religious family, this is quite scandalous.",

I have no memory of this conversation, even though apparently I was in the room at the time.\n\nIn 2001 my Great Grandpa on my dad's side had sadly passed away after drowning in a pool. My whole family was devastated, and after the funeral everyone gathered at my Grandpa's house. There was a ton of family there, but in the basement was me, my mom, my Grandpa, both of my Grandpa's bothers and my Great Grandma. That's when my mom decided to stand up and say \"Alright, he's dead. Your secret can come out. Which one of you shot the cow?\"\n\nYou see, back when my Grandpa and his brothers were younger, they helped my Great Grandpa take care of their farm. They had this one cow that was a milk cow, and my Great Grandpa loved this cow. Well, one of his 3 kids apparently \"accidentally\" shot this cow in the ass. The cow didn't die, but she could no longer produce milk anymore and my Great Grandpa was pissed. But unfortunately, he couldn't figure out who shot the cow and no one would fess up. This was back in the late 1940s or early 1950s. No one wanted to admit that they shot the cow.\n\nSo my mom asks the question and it's just silence for about 5 seconds before my Great Uncle starts snickering and my Grandpa starts stuttering. It was then, for the first time in about 50 years that my Grandpa finally admitted that he was the one who shot the cow. He was stuttering about how it was an accident but he also didn't feel bad about it because he hated that cow. Everyone in the room just started laughing, and when my mom got home later that night and told my dad what had happened, he didn't want to believe her. My dad couldn't go to the funeral because of his job (prison guard), so he missed that conversation. \n\nThis story has recently come up in our family again, as both my Grandpa and my Grandma have moved into assisted living and we were cleaning out their house. Well, apparently my Grandpa made a special request that my mom gets to have the gun that he used to shot the cow, because in his words \"I still can't believe my daughter-in-law managed to squeeze that story out of me first.\"",

After I found those with my last name, I decided to check out the various other names tied to my family. There was a happy older guy chilling out on a stump by the old church adjacent to the cemetery, and I asked him if he could point me in the direction of  a certain family‚Äôs area in the cemetery. He pointed me in the direction past a row of trees, that sure didn‚Äôt look part of the cemetery. Walked through all the brush, hopped over a dilapidated fence, and found myself amongst a bunch of poorly maintained grave stones. Found this part of the family‚Äôs graves, which were in as equally of bad of shape as the rest, which struck me as odd as I‚Äôd always been told they had been particularly wealthy. Eventually I started looking at the other graves around and noticed names like ‚ÄúFreeman‚Äù and one guys first and middle names were ‚ÄúGeorge Washington‚Äù and I started to wonder. I walked back to the old guy and asked about any other graves with the last name in the main part of the cemetery, and he responded in his thick accent ‚ÄúNah, if you‚Äôre looking for the white *last name*s you wanna drive over to the *random cemetary*.‚Äù I just looked at him blankly, and said ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the white ones?‚Äù With my yankee accent and struggling to compute  expression, he caught on I was out of the loop. The old guy‚Äôs family goes back as far as mine, and he affiliated with that county‚Äôs historical society, so he filled me in. As it turned out, my 4th(?) great-grandfather owned a plantation, which my parents did do me a favor of letting me know, but what they left out is he had a thing for sleeping with (or as far as we know, raping) his female slaves, which resulted in illegitimate offspring who bore his last name. I returned home, and went to my dad about it, and he was just like ‚ÄúYeah, I was never too sure how to bring that one up.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt find out until  4th grade, following integration, when some black students told him they were cousins.",

            "text": "  When I was little my parents told my siblings and me our cat ran away when I was little. He was really my sister's cat. We got him from our at for valentines day. My mom said he got out when she was letting our dogs out. \n    Well the other day my mom and I were talking about our old house and we got in to talking about our pet. We have had a lot of different pets. We had  buried them in the back yard after they past away. Then I mentioned are dog we gave away. This caused my mom to say she hoped that dog died. I got shocked at this. I asked her why then she explained that our cat had not ran away. She didn't tell me or my sister, but my brother and the rest of my family new. The cat actually got killed by the dog.  The dog got out of his kennel that we kept him in some times (this is when I found out he tried to attack our other two dogs). He got ahold of the cat and bit down on his neck. My mom found him dead with a lot of blood around. Me and my sister were at my grandparents house so we didn't know till we got home. My mom had buried him in the back yard and cleaned everything before we got home. Two weeks later we came home from school, and the dog was gone. Then our parents told us the gave him away because he was sick, and they couldn't pay the vet bill. \n      After that I remembered when me and my sister were in my grandparents woods, and found a dead animal that looked kinda like a dog . I really think my mom told my grandparents about it. And that my grandpa and mom took that dog out back and shot it. Now only my sister doesn't know. I was told never to tell her. My sister loved that cat and that dog. I really hope what I saw that day wasn't my dog, and that he got a good new home. But I am happy my parents didn't let him stick around to hurt any of my other animals.",
