He only talked to me because of her, and he only wanted to talk to me about Hollywood Undead. Doesn't help that i can be considered pretty, which probably added to him talking to me. \nSkip ahead to Freshman year. (F) is kinda weird and gives off neckbeard-nice guy vibes. When i say he's creepy, i mean, \"wear my skin,\" creepy. \nAnyways, i had Choir. I hated choir because im quiet and just about never talk. Eventually, (F) realizes im in choir and he is, too. (F) came in about 3 or 4 times. This time, (F) was being abnormally flirty and got me alone in the corner, only to proceed to touch my legs and thighs innapropriately. I told him to stop, but he wouldn't. \nIt takes me going outside to where people wete and putting my backpack between us at a round table for him to leave me alone. \nAbout a year later in Sophmore year, im walking across campus to Biology after lunch. (F) goes out of his way to stop me and make sure i won't walk away to talk about how, \"some girl was checking him out while in line for yearbook pictures,\" and proceeds to, \"Uhg, woman, am i right?\" He makes me give him a hug before i leave. \n(F) tried to get me to add him on Instagram, and found an account that didn't have my name. Promptly abandoned it at started a new. He tried tk find my acc a few more times and pester me before leaving me alone. Like i said, he was \"wear my skin\" creepy and not someone i would trust to be alone with.",

Had been living with a guy for five years, she thought he was mentally ill. She wanted to leave him but couldn't afford to move out. Four children still live at home. One lived with her father.\n\nShe had told the guy she met someone and wanted him to move out. During the lunch he calls her. Doesn't want to lose her. She wouldn't talk. Let him know she was on a date. They start texting back and forth. I suggested I return her to her car so she could go home or continue texting at her car. She wanted me to convince her she should not stay with him any longer. Move on. I agreed that might be a good plan since she was so unhappy. She started crying about not wanting to be alone. Needed sex too often to live alone etc. I was driving slower, my thought was to give her time to calm down, suddenly she became scared of me. She had five young children. Made a comment about what's going to happen to them when her body is never found? (At least she saw me as a very skilled serial killer, eh?)\n\nI had not intended to drive anywhere with her. I thought we'd eat somewhere near the shopping center. But she wanted something specific to eat across town and asked me to drive. As weird as the date was it turned out really funny to me.

I had some choice words to say on the phone to her and her mother who she tried to put on the phone to explain why she couldn't be there the one time I actually needed her and hung up.\n\nI I then called my brothers wife's sister who lived further away than she did to pick me up and she did despite the fact she had a full-time job and had work the next morning, she must've had two hours sleep that night for helping me and didn't complain once or even question the act of helping in that scenario. \n\nThe sad part is after my Nan and grandads passing I actually went back to her for a brief time and in hindsight I think this was purely my subconscious mind trying to seek comfort in old routines or previous behaviours as my head at the time was fucked. \n\nI can safely say that today I am much better off in every way possible after learning some hard lessons on those nights.",

Around senior year of high school, started dating a girl in winter. So we've only been with each other in heavy clothes. She was very sweet, curvy and cute, and I found her very attractive. After about 2 weeks we never got too hot and heavy, just making out and over the clothes stuff. One night I swing by while she's in the shower, so her Mom has me wait in her room while she let her know I was there. I'm sitting on her bed and start looking around and I turn around and notice that one wall is a altar to the band Hanson, completely covered in photos and magazine clippings. Keep in mind, this was a good 8-10 years after the band faded from popularity. So I say to myself 'Huh that's somewhat creepy, but whatever, I've got my guilty pleasures too.' Eventually she emerges from her shower wearing a t-shirt and boy shorts and we kiss and I pull her in tight... and that's when it hits me. A wave of unholy B.O. that has no earthly right being on a person, let alone someone right out of a shower. So I pull back, look at her quizzically, look at the Hanson shrine, and did enough mental gymnastics to worm my way out of her embrace and get the F out. I still don't know if the shock of finding that wall flipped something in my brain or if she really just stunk that bad despite bathing, but either way, that was that.",

Then she tells him that she‚Äôs coming to the hospital, more than an hour away in the middle of the night. And his phone died.

The next day when we got back they had a huge argument about him ‚Äúspending the night‚Äù with me and when he pointed out that he could have died.

My friend's husband had 4 kids - 2 kids with his ex, one kid with a 2nd woman that noone was supposed to know about that he had no contact with, and one kid with my friend (let's call her Jess).\n\nJess calls me one night and wanted to meet at an all night restaurant because she just \"had to get out of the house, he is being very unreasonable!\"  \n\nThis situation happened a lot because her husband expected her to take care of all 3 kids all the time, but she wasn't too fond of the older step kids and they would piss her off a lot.  She would complain, he would hear out both sides of the story and choose a side.  When he chose the kids' side is when she would call me to vent.\n\nAnyway, she is obviously very upset and needed a friend more than normal this time.  I meet her at the restaurant and she tells me about the kid I've never heard of.  Basically, her husband was called by this kid's school as an emergency contact (he had no idea he was the kid's emergency contact number.  He hadn't talked to the mother in over 5 years and the kid is probably 7 or 8 at this time).  The school could not get ahold of the kid's mom or grandparents and resorted to calling Jess's husband.  This sent Jess into a fit because she liked to pretend this kid didn't exist.  Her husband took the kid to his workplace and did what he needed to in order to get the kid back to his mother. The situation was an actual emergency.  Something involving a car accident and people in the hospital.\nAfter the mother was found and the kid was back where he should be, Jess and her husband had a looooong talk.  She basically told him that if this kid ever comes back into their lives, she is taking her child and leaving.  Husband better not dare consider being apart of his son's life, or his current wife and youngest child will be gone and he will never hear from them again.\n\nI asked why she hated this kid so much and why she didn't want her child to know about the long lost brother... her answer was spotty, but basically came down to, \"I don't hate him, but he's special needs and I don't need to deal with him or his mother.\"\n\nShe doesn't want a father and son to know each other because she's so jealous of the mother, or because she thinks it will be more work for her..., maybe because she doesn't think her husband will love their child as much...?  I'm not sure, but it was just so shitty.\n\n\nAfter this, I didn't go out to eat with her anymore.  I ended up moving far away and ghosted her.  She texts me every now and then, but I don't answer.",

She seemed cool, our conversations vibed, so eventually after a few days I ask her out so we can meet in person.\n\nThe only time we had available was a Sunday afternoon for lunch, so we decided to meet at noon at a local restaurant. We both seemed genuinely excited about meeting up, and continued to text one another as the week passed.\n\nThat Friday, I sent her a simple message, something along the line like \"hey, hope you're having a good day!\" Didn't hear anything back from her. Left it alone, no biggie.\n\nThat Saturday, I send her another message in the afternoon, saying something like \"I look forward to meeting you tomorrow\" or something to that regard. Still nothing from her. Then Sunday rolls around.\n\nFor some context, there's a thing in online dating they call \"ghosting.\" That's when things are going well with a new person you meet, and then out of nowhere, they just disappear. They completely stop texting, calling, messaging. It doesn't happen TOO often, but it occurs enough to have a name given to it (ghosting). Also, I want to point out, I am fully aware she has no obligation to speak with me, or get back to me. We haven't even met yet, so I'm certainly not expecting much. However, we talked all the time for about a week, and for it to suddenly stop I would at least like a confirmation that she still intends on showing up. Plus, I'm not super excited about being stood up lol\n\nBack to the story, I contact her Sunday morning with one last message about our plans. I ask if we are still on for our date, and explained that if she's decided to ghost me, that's fine, I won't bother her if she's not interested. I also explain the purpose for my text is that since I hadn't heard from her, I wasn't planning on driving over to the restaurant without any kind of confirmation that she was still planning on going, for the reasons of the ghosting. \n\nWell, THEN I hear from her... She preceeded to yell at me (all caps) and tell me that she owes me nothing and ghosting \"only occurs\" when you're in a relationship, which we were not. It sounded like she was getting mad because I used the term \"ghosting\" wrong...\n\nNeedless to say, I never messaged her again, nor did I even consider driving over to that restaurant. Definitely dodged a bullet on that one.",

For the sake of privacy and safety, I‚Äôm not going to clarify where this took place or where we are now, so please don‚Äôt ask. She met this dude, fell in love with him super hard, and moved in with him within a week. That‚Äôs about when he started being controlling. It was little stuff at first, like ‚Äúhey, can you please not touch my stuff without asking first?‚Äù Reasonable enough requests like that, but soon they grew to the point where it was straight up ‚Äúno. You can‚Äôt go hang out with your friend, he‚Äôs a guy‚Äù or ‚Äúno, I don‚Äôt want you spending the night at your friend‚Äôs apartment, I don‚Äôt like her.‚Äù\n\nIt soon got to the point where she wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave the house, unless it was with him. She was a literal prisoner, and he threatened to kill himself if she even thought about leaving him. She ended up sneaking out of bed one night, picking the lock to the cabinet he locked her phone in (strange skill, I know, but she wanted to be a James Bond style spy when she was a kid so she learned a bunch of stuff like that) and she called her mom for help. She was sure he‚Äôd kill her if she called the police, so she arranged for her mom to text her the next day when she was ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to have her phone. She then deleted the texts and snuck her phone back in. \n\nHer mom texted her saying that she was terminally ill with cancer, and that she wanted her to come see her in the hospital before she died. The dude said some thing along the lines of ‚Äúthat‚Äôs too bad. You aren‚Äôt going anywhere.‚Äù So she waited a couple days, got him extremely drunk one night until she was sure he wasn‚Äôt able to go after her, took his keys, got her phone, unlocked the door, and finally ran away, making sure to slash his tires so he couldn‚Äôt follow her if he tried to drive. \n\nHer parents had already been working with the local police on getting her out (despite her not wanting to involve them), and when she called her parents after running away, a couple cars and an ambulance met her in the road and took her to a local hospital while other officers went into the house, arrested the bastard, and the house was cordoned off while they investigated. \n\nFor some reason the fucker only got like five years in prison, despite overwhelming evidence that he‚Äôd essentially kidnapped her, kept her prisoner for almost a month, sexually assaulted her, and beaten her, so her and her entire family moved out of the state. This was a couple of years ago when she was 18, so we‚Äôre all nervous about him getting out. She‚Äôs sent us all pictures of him and the friends he used to hang out with, so our friend group is always watching out around town, plus the Sheriff‚Äôs office of the county where this happened said that they‚Äôd keep tabs on him and that they‚Äôd contact her when he gets released. We‚Äôre honestly hoping he does something stupid and never gets out, if you know what I mean. \n\nMy friend is fine now (physically, at least) and ever since she told us, we‚Äôve been making sure that she gets to therapy every week, and we make sure that at least one other person is with her at all times, so she isn‚Äôt alone unless she wants to be, and even then she has a couple more friends who live a few doors down from her.",

Recently we had gotten back together after yet another instance of drunken belligerence. Long story short, she had tried to one-two punch me for trying to walk away from having a \"discussion\" with her after she'd been on a 24 hour binge. Luckily I had my wits about me and managed to dodge the swings like it was a World Star video.  \n\n\nThe week of Valentine's she had been telling me about sending cards to friends and family, buying a gift card for a massage/spa day for one of her coworkers, going out for dinner and drinks with all her girlfriends to celebrate \"Galentine's\". Valentine's celebrations between us had always been lowkey -- usually just spent the night at home cooking a nice dinner. I had planned to make hand rolled ravioli for us, and splurged a little on some nice wine/champagne for us. She was very insistent on cooking dinner at her house, so I had to lug all my cooking equipment over to her house. She showed up for dinner an hour late, a little tipsy from drinking at the bar with her girlfriend, without even so much as an apology. On top of that she didn't even have a nice little card or anything for me. After a week of hearing about all the things she'd done for everyone else in her life, perhaps I thought she might go a little above and beyond for me. It was in that moment what I had suspected for many months became crystal clear:  \n\n\nI would always be at the bottom of her list of priorities. I was in that relationship for her benefit. To serve her. There wasn't an us, and there never would be an us. Couple that with the years of emotional manipulation, the occasions of physical abuse, and it was the final straw that broke the camel's back.

            "text": "There were red flags before this and after, but this even, which happened near the end, was the first time I thought in the moment that I had to leave.\n\nI was with my ex husband for ten years, married for eight. When we met I was strongly religious and conservative. My ex made a big deal of asking if I was a virgin, being glad that I was, and telling me that he was a virgin too. I was actually pleased with this interaction because I believed in only having sex after marriage, and it can be hard to find others who also believe that. There are even less people who believe in this than it seems, because a lot of people who claim to believe in sex after marriage only have sec anyway on the DL, or they are some kind of fetishist and don't actually believe. I was stoked to find a regular guy invested in waiting. He said he had been naked with a woman before and cuddled, but hadn't really done the deed. Freshness seal still in place. Great!\n\nFast forward ten years. We were arguing. We had a lot of sexual compatibility problems. According to him they were all exclusively my fault (red flag). In the midst of this argument where he's trying to prove all the problems are mine, he says, \"The other woman wasn't like that!\"\n\nI froze, and then reminded him if his claim to virginity. \"Oops! Lol!\"\n\nBy this time I'd toned down the religion stuff and I didn't really care about the sex itself. If he had come to me and said, \"Look, I lied to you when we first met, I'm really sorry, please forgive me\" it really would not have been a big deal and I would have forgiven him. But 1) he didn't care enough about me to do a good job of keeping track of his lies, 2) he thought it was funny that I found out--he clearly had no qualms about hurting my feelings, and 3) I found out in the context that him comparing me and her sexually. That's a deal breaker, ladies.\n\nHe basically said it was okay that he lied to me because it was ok for him to lie in order to get what he wanted, and because my inferior ladybrain would have overreacted if he'd told the truth--not that it was any of my business in the first place.\n\nI wasn't able to get out immediately, but I decided that day that I needed to and was out within a year. He spent the intervening time proving I was making the right decision.",

(we were both 15 atm) we talked to (AND texted) each other almost everyday but I never really developed any romantic feelings for her. Never even saw her that way... she was just a friend, an adored friend, YES... but only a friend.\n\nOne evening, we were at her place, just watching movies and binge eating nachos (bro we ‚ú®LOVE‚ú® nachos) and then, um all of a sudden, she goes ‚ÄúI think I like you‚Äù\nIt took me a second to register that and then I jocularly replied, ‚Äúyou THINK? I mean...I‚Äôm 100% sure that I absolutely loveeee YOU‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh My God, really?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah hehe...why else do you think I spend so much time with you?...isn‚Äôt it obvious?‚Äù\n\nShe then proceeded to hug me...I found it a little weird but hugged her back anyway\n\n\nOver the next week, I learned that she had told all her friends (and mine, since a lot of our friends were mutual) that  we had begun dating each other and  had even made out (like, wtf?)\n\nI mean, when I first got to know about this fictional story of hers, I was absolutely broken. I felt terrible. Then it hit me like a truck, when she said that she ‚Äúliked‚Äù me...she didn‚Äôt mean it as a friend. I was devastated.\n\n\nI told her that I wished to meet her. She readily agreed. When we met, she seemed like she didn‚Äôt even care about having spread a rumour about our ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù \nNow, I, despite trying very hard,  just couldn‚Äôt hold my tears back...\n\n‚ÄúWhy did you tell everyone that we made out?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt? We can now., though...‚Äù\n\nShe tried leaning in for a kiss...\nI immediately slung myself away from her...\n\n\nI was crying my eyes out...\nMy voice broke mid-way while I was trying to say:\n\n‚ÄúI was so wrong. I don‚Äôt love you. I despise you...‚Äù\n\n(Gosh, I‚Äôm so effing dramatic lmao)\n\nIt was such a messed up thing to say, on my part... I‚Äôm still ashamed of myself for having made such an acerbic comment... \nI don‚Äôt exactly know if I said something as vicious as that out of rage, or bc I was hurt, maybe? I don‚Äôt know...\n\n\nAnyway, that was the last day she ever spoke to me directly...\n\nWe still have each other‚Äôs phone numbers and do stumble across each other occasionally since she lives in my neighbourhood..\n\n\nNever in my worst nightmares had I ever imagined that one of my friends, one of the people I call my own, could swoop so low for god-knows-what? To this day, I don‚Äôt even get why she did what she did...like what did she even plan on accomplishing (other than losing a friend, ofc)\n\n\nI guess both of us were terrible friends to each other...?\n\n\nEdit: Idk why some of you think that I played around with her emotions?\n\nWhen I said ‚Äúyou THINK? I mean...I‚Äôm 100% sure that I absolutely loveeee YOU‚Äù, I genuinely couldn‚Äôt make out that she liked me ‚Äúromantically‚Äù...I thought what she meant was...‚ÄùYo you‚Äôre a nice guy...I think I like you‚Äù",

I offered to DD for them. Well, she drives over to my house and leaves her car parked out front. I drive her and her friends over to the place they're going to and head home.\n\nAround 10:30ish, I was kind of half asleep and I hear a car door and and can see a little light coming from out front. For a second, my half asleep brain thought \"Maybe they ubered and she's picking up her car.\" But then I jumped full awake, looked out the window and her car was being broken into. I grab my gun and let the dog out. Dog corners the guy and I put my up but aimed low. Turns out it was a meth'd out kid (16-17) that was breaking in. I checked what he stole and put it all back and debate whether to call the police. I call her to see if I should check for anything valuable. No answer. I text \"Hey sorry but your car was broken into. Do you want me to send an uber for so you can check for anything missing?\" No response. After about 20 minutes I just let the kid go.\n\nHer response about an hour later: \"Go back to sleep. Don't worry about it. I probably left it unlocked. I will call you when we are ready.\"\n\nWTF?\n\nKeep in mind I was full of adrenaline and wired from having held a meth'd out kid at gun point. All I could think about for the 3 hours was that I could have shot a kid for rummaging through a bunch of workout clothes.\n\nI eventually picked her up and she didn't say anything the entire ride. When we got back to my house she headed straight to her vehicle and I started walking inside. She called me back and apologized and said she didn't realize I was telling the truth about the break-in. I told her to stay since she was drunk and shouldn't drive. We hooked up. She told me she loved me. We had sex again. After she went to sleep I stayed up thinking about how weird of a situation to be told \"I love you.\" How weird it was that she literally didn't care about her car being broken into. Then, as she is leaving in the morning, she spots a bullet on the floor that had cleared out when I chambered the weapon. She was like \"you really held the gun to someone.\" I said \"yeah, you didn't feel me trembling all last night. I was a nervous wreck.\" It dawned on me in that moment that she never even asked how I was doing or if I was ok.\n\nThat was my *nope* moment. I ended it later that afternoon.",

We both realized when we were telling one another about this girl and were like.... Huh. How about that? I confronted her and said I was fine with an open relationship, so long as the rules applied to both of us, which she got furious with me about. So I was like.... Nah.\n\nAnother girl threw a coffee mug at me. I was concussed from the strike and most of the entire day is lost. I vaguely remember there being a fight, about what I can only speculate from previous fights. I had a chip on my shoulder because she came from some money (like upper middle class to my barely above the poverty line) and I was jealous of the opportunities that afforded her. Of course being an idiot 18 year old I couldn't articulate that in a healthy way at all...\n\nOne girl was convinced I was cheating on her, and rather than talk to me about it she went and cheated back... I think because she and I hadn't had sex she was thinking I wasn't interested/more interested in others. In reality, she was so fun/hot I didn't want to rush in and screw it up. Whoops.\n\nOne girl literally dated me as evidence that she was over her ex... She wasn't. \n\nI also dated a girl for a few weeks, and she told me that Eric Clapton's Cocaine wasn't about cocaine. So I'm like.... Alright what is it about? She says, with not a hint of irony, heroin. I realized then that it wasn't going to work out.\n\nFinally, a girl I was... Sort of dating? More like make out at the end of parties. Came out to me as gay. Which I was like ooooooooooooh that makes so much sense! And we ended up continuing being good friends after that. She taught me a LOT about the process of coming to the conclusion that she was gay, the decision to come out, and dealing with people and society as it slowly advances.

Sure as shit, I hit the poor duck. I ran back down the road to where the duck was after stopping safely off to the side ahead to see if the duck was miraculously okay or if I could help it, take it to the animal emergency clinic... Anything! I couldn't. It was too late. I was really torn up, I love animals, couldn't believe that had just happened. I put the duck safely off to the side of the road out of the way of other passing vehicles and then started walking back to my car. As I climbed back into the car, clearly not happy with the accident I had just caused, I looked over at my (EX) girlfriend and she just started laughing. Confused? I asked her what was happening. She was laughing that I just hit and killed that poor duck. I said nothing. Put the car in drive, turned off the busy road we were on the next street. Leaned across her and pulled the door handle on her side. While I leaned back up straight to adjust back into my seat I un-clicked her seat belt and told her to get out. She thought I was joking. She got out and I leaned back over, closed the door and drove off. After I got the angry texts and calls from her when she finally got home, I broke up with her.

She did something to piss the mafia off (I don‚Äôt know what, she wouldn‚Äôt tell me) and had to leave Italy in a hurry. After working as a stripper at the CassaRosso in Amsterdam and working as the merch girl on a world tour by The Police ( the band) she ended up living with an aunt in Birmingham.  Which is why I met her. She moved into my flat in Bournville and at first everything was great - except she would insist in ironing all my clothes, including my jeans, which looked ridiculous. Anyway, her increasing erratic behaviour and extreme jealousy really got me down. Things came to a head one evening at home when a female colleague who was on call phoned me because she couldn‚Äôt get the C.T. Scanner to start up, so I gave her instructions and got it sorted. Stefania was so outraged at my talking to a woman she attacked me with a carving knife, whilst screaming at me in Italian. I escaped with a few defensive wounds to hands and wrists, and threw her out that night. \n\nFast forward two years and there is a call on the hospital tannoy that my sister is waiting for me at the reception desk. Which was weird because I have four brothers and no sisters. At the reception I find a heavily pregnant Stevie. We go to lunch she tells me she had a relationship with a. British soldier who in the time-honoured fashion had dumped her when he discovered she was in the club. She wanted her child born in Italy, I said ‚ÄúHang on, don‚Äôt the Camorra want you dead?‚Äù She said that wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, because they have a kind of code where they don‚Äôt whack pregnant women or those suckling a baby. So she would be safe. We kissed goodbye and she promised to get in touch when back in the U.k. \n\nThe rest of the story I heard from a former colleague of hers. She was too late in the pregnancy to fly so she took the train to Napoli.  On the train in northern Italy she spontaneously aborted the foetus. She was rushed to hospital because she was bleeding heavily, and of course she was no longer pregnant or suckling so her life was in danger. Anyways, she asked to see the Hospital‚Äôs Catholic priest to ask him what would happen to her lost baby‚Äôs soul. He told her as the baby had not been christened it could not go to heaven and must stay in purgatory for all time. Stevie apparently had a total meltdown and was eventually admittedly to a psychiatric hospital. There for me the story ends, I don‚Äôt know how long she was in hospital for, or if the Camorra ever found out she was back in country. I don‚Äôt know what country she is in or if she‚Äôs even alive or dead.  Periodically, I Google her name or that of her ex colleague but I can find no trace.  I think about her all the time.",

            "text": "Don't know if this really fits, but here it goes.\n\nWhen I was 18 I met a woman in my senior year who was in my grade. We quickly hit it off and I very quickly fell madly in love with her. I was in high school, so going to school 40 hours a week and also working 40 hours a week to pay the outrageous rent that my mom was making me pay to live in the house that I grew up in. I would get up at 7am, go to school, go from school to work, work till midnight, come home, get some sleep, and do it all again. Worked two 12 hour shifts on the weekends. Had one night off during the week.\n\nI would spend every available moment stuck to her side like a lost puppy, and in a sense that's what I was. My father had died a particularly scarring death when I was 13, and it had really rearranged my brain. I was an angry, bitter, lost person. She saw this, she knew I was desperate and weak.\n\nIt was all perfect for the first few months. Then she turned on a dime. The physical abuse began, the emotional abuse began, the stalking, the cheating. I blamed it all on myself, I deserved it because I was a terrible person. My mom abused me, must have been because I'm a terrible person. My dad died thinking I'd hated him. I was the worst of the worst, and this was the sentence I was receiving for everything I had done.\n\nBut I was blindly in love, falling down that spiral, deeper and deeper. I was trapped, I constantly felt like I was in a cage. She would often say she was leaving me, just to see how heartbroken I was about it. How desperately I clung to her. She knew I needed her, or at least I thought I did.\n\nThe cycle continued. She controlled me. She owned my life. Everything I was, everything I lived for was her. The abuse continued and got worse, when I would ask her to stop, she would say \"you're a man, just take it\".\n\nIf I ever tried to leave she would threaten suicide. She would follow me everywhere constantly. I was in an uncontrollable pitfall and I didn't know what to do.\n\nI wish the story had a happy conclusion, but no. We graduated, and she wanted to move back to her home state to \"take care of her grandma\". I had suspicions, she would always tell me how I wasn't good enough and her family hated me. All the men she would leave me for in a heartbeat, she made it out like she was with me for pity. And I took that as a sign of her love.\n\n12 days. That's all it took. Less than 2 weeks, she was on vacation in Mexico cheating on me. She told me she'd found another guy that was so much better and that I was an awful person and she never should have dated me. I believed her.\n\nI told her I was going to tell people about all the horrible abusive things she did to me. She said that if I ever spoke, she would lie to everyone and tell the police that I had raped her. Obviously I didn't, I never raised a finger against her. I was taught by my dad that it's not okay to hit women, and I never have, never will. I don't have the heart to bring myself to do something that terrible to someone. But I knew that I would be arrested and sent to prison anyways. Whenever I tried to tell any of my friends or family, they would discredit me because I'm a man. \"So she hit you? So what?\"\n\nI was treated like my story didn't matter. Like I didn't matter. And I believed it. I was still destroyed by her leaving, I still loved her through all of it. And in the end, I was weak. I didn't even have the fucking balls to leave. She was the one that left. If she hadn't left, I would've been stuck in that hell forever. It was just another prison. I fell deeper and deeper into my depression. It culminated on December 13th, 2019. I sat on my bed, tears streaming down my face, my pistol in my hand, ready to die.\n\nOut of nowhere, a buddy I hadn't spoken to in over a year texted me. I don't believe in God, but this is one of those things that makes me wonder if something is watching over me. He sent me a snap of him at his grandma's house, a place we used to hang out at in high-school. It was about 2am. I asked if I could come over. He said sure. The last little flame inside of me refused to go out. The very bitter end of my soul refused to die that day, it sparked a whole new fire, it saw the chance to escape that suicide and it grabbed hold of it with my whole life force. To this day, that friend has no idea that he saved my life. A simple act of letting someone come over and watch YouTube with you. We sat in near silence, and soon he was asleep. I quietly gathered my things and left. He had no idea what he had done that day, but I will never forget it. Sometimes, one friend can change a life. One day can drastically change the future of someone. Never forget that, take every chance to be that saving grace for someone. Be kind, sometimes you just may save someone's life.\n\nThe next day I went out, on my own volition, to get a counselor. For once, I felt real. Like people could see me and I was a person. Ever since that day I have raged against domestic abuse, especially those men out there who have been abused and feel they cannot come forward.\n\nI have decided I don't live for me. My purpose here in life is to give a voice to those who need it, to be the hope for those who have none. I pray that people in abusive relationships see me and realize that they are not alone. I have seen the fires of hell, every waking hour of this life I have lived has been a battle for my life. But I refuse to go down. And you should too. There's still so much worth fighting for. Life is short, and the world is beautiful. What's the rush? Enjoy it all while you can.\n\nEscape your toxic life. Being backed into a corner is the best place to fight from, because it's infinitely more satisfying when you turn it around. Every day is a fight to the death, there is no time to lay down and be walked over like I was.\n\nThere is still time to go out and make this world your own.",

I lived in Antwerp at the time and I invited her to a great jazz bar (De Muze, for anyone interested) to start off the evening. She knew a restaurant and would take me there afterwards. \n\nFirst of all, she was late. Not \"can't find parking\" late, but \"I have not left yet at the meeting time\" late. She asked me to order her something and she would arrive shortly. There I was with 2 red wines enduring the waitress' looks of \"ah, she stood you up\".\n\nFirst thing she says is not \"sorry I'm late\". It was \"I don't like your shoes\" I usually wear very generic black leather shoes, the kind that reaaly cannot be ugly or beautiful. In any case, she finishes 2 red wines like lemonade, she talks about her exciting day as a clothes shop manager and we leave for dinner.\n\nAt this point I have determined that I want to keep it short. But I was hungry as well, so I decide to stick it out. She could not find the restaurant she knew, while roaming the streets of Antwerp. All of a sudden she yells \"here, it is!\" I have an inkling she was relieved to find a place that was labeled \"restaurant\" to save face.\n\nThe place was brightly lit, table cloth was plastic and the food was made with powder and hot water I think. The wine was apparently good, since we emptied a bottle. I had one glass.\n\nFinally I could go home, only to find out we were parked near each other. So we walked to the parking spot. We passed an erotic shop and she pointed out some stuff that, while designed for human orifices, looked terrifying. She said \"next time we can go there and buy each other a gift\".\n\nUpon arriving at my car I said goodbye, and went home. I logged on and saw her online. Relieved that she did not crash her drunken ass, I blocked her.\n\nShe was smoking hot though.",

I stuck around because I knew she would fufill the threats she made (She had proven that previously) another month later, found out she was cheating on me for half the time we had been dating. And to top it off, she had tried to make me and this guy besties over the summer by hanging out with us together and suggesting we get to know each other. He was a cool guy and I dont think he ever found out that he'd been played... \n\nat that point I tried to talk to her about how we could amicably seperate because while I cared about her, I was really hurt by all the stuff she had done. I got huge paragraphs about how we were never actually a thing and I was a place holder she could kick around \"like a small animal\" ??? There was a bunch more but anyway, I jumped ship after that and just tried to minimize the damage she had caused with the people in my life.  \n\nShe had told most people we knew that I abused her and she was too scared to leave. When I broke up with her she posted on social media a bunch of \"end domestic violence\" posts and linked abuse survivors stories to her profile with messages like \"we are in this together\" \n\nI had wanted to be friends with a guy she knew even before we had been dating,  she said that he kind of hated me and thought I was weird and gross. At the time I believed her wholeheartedly, not to mention he avoided me like the plague. It turns out she told him that I was stalking her and tried to rape her and whatnot, so understandably he wasnt a fan. \n\nAbout a year after me and this girl parted ways, I wondered why the guy hated me so much so I started talking to him once in a while. We hit it off and a few months after, we started dating. It turns out that the reason my ex had told him all that horrible stuff about me was he thought I looked friendly but she liked him so she did her best to polarize us. After I left, she ruined his 3yr relationship with his gf (manipulation of course) he realized how toxic she was and left. And then we connected later that year. Me and that guy are still together, and have been for years. So I suppose it worked out in the end, and gave my partner and I mutual trauma to bond over. \n\nAnyway yeah, so that happened :)",

            "text": "**Short version:** Was in a traumatizing car accident and when she got home, all she did was complain about how annoying one of her coworkers was.\n\n\\---\n\n**Long version** (OK, it's super long...)**:**\n\n*Warning: Blood and actual gore could be triggering.*\n\nA few years ago, I was driving on the freeway on my way to work. Traffic came to a stop due to a fender-bender and I had to hit my brakes fairly hard to stop in time (but not *unreasonably* hard‚Äîthe backpack I had on the passenger seat tipped over, but didn't fall off the seat). The big delivery truck behind me changed into the next lane to have a little more stopping distance, and the guy on the motorcycle behind him saw that the truck was changing lanes, but didn't see that traffic was stopped, so he sped up to fill the gap, only to find my car (and all the cars in front of me) at a complete stop in front of him. He swerved to miss me, but ended up slamming into the back of my car, pinning his leg between his bike and my bumper, then was thrown off his bike and went careening off toward the side of the road. \n\nI got out of the car and immediately saw that his leg had been snapped in half at the thigh and was literally folded over underneath him with mangled flesh scattered around him and blood pooling underneath him. He was clearly in shock. When a bystander (one of the people from the original fender-bender) asked if he could feel his leg, his response was ‚ÄúWhy, does it look like it's broken or something?‚Äù After making sure someone called an ambulance, I sat with him and talked to him until they arrived, then reported what had happened to the police, etc., and finally limped my still-mostly-drivable car back home, even though half the bumper was hanging off. When I got home, I called my boss to tell him I wouldn't be in for work that day, and then literally had to wash blood and chunks of human flesh off of what was left of my bumper.\n\nAs I was doing so, an Animal Control truck pulled up and the guy asked if I lived there, then pulled my dog out of his truck and asked if it was my dog. It was the dog I had told my wife we shouldn't get, because life was already crazy enough, but she got it anyway. It turns out that she had let the dog out to pee that morning, but hadn't bothered to let her back in, so the dog had been roving the neighborhood and somebody had called about her. It also turned out that my wife hadn't bothered to immunize or register her, so there was no record of her in the county database, and the guy had been about to take her to the pound.\n\nAnyway, this whole conversation was happening while I was washing human flesh off of my bumper, so I assured the guy that we would get the dog registered, and tried to end the conversation as quickly as I could. Then I called my wife to tell her about the accident, and how shaken up I was. Her only response was \"Oh man, that sucks\". Then when I told her about the Animal Control incident, she was like \"Oh, since you're *taking the day off anyway*, if you could take care of the dog's registration and stuff, that'd be great.\" Like, yes, I was so traumatized I didn't feel like I could go in to work, but sure, ask me to take care of the registration for the dog that I told you we shouldn't get.\n\nNeedless to say, I did not take care of the dog's registration. I took a shower, put on some fresh clothes, then sat staring at the wall and shaking, wondering if the guy was going to make it, and replaying the accident over and over trying to think if there was anything I could have done differently (there wasn't). When my wife got home, she burst in the door and immediately began complaining about how one of her coworkers was acting like a bitch (which, it later turned out, was intentional because the coworker suspected my wife was having an affair with another one of their coworkers, which it later turned out she was). She didn't utter a single word about the car accident, didn't ask how I was, and when I finally told her that I was still really shaken up about it, she just kind of brushed it off and asked if I had happened to put in a load of laundry, since I had been home anyway.\n\nI was messed up enough about the accident that I didn't want to go back into work in person, but was lucky enough that I was able to work from home for a few days. Over the course of the next week she (1) complained that I was working from home, but that I wasn't using the ‚Äúextra time‚Äù to cook dinner before she got home, (2) complained that I was working in the house and not outside since it was so beautiful outside, (3) complained that I didn't take the dog for a walk in the middle of my workday, (4) told me that it was fun driving together when I eventually went back to work and she gave me a ride because my car was in the shop, (5) told me the next day that it was too stressful and she couldn't handle riding to work together anymore, (6) told me that I'd have to figure out how to get to the rental car place on my own (once the other guy's insurance finally agreed to pay for it), because she had already had enough of my accident, and (7) complained that I was a pushover for not making them give me a luxury SUV to replace my compact car, because ‚Äúthe accident was the other guy's fault and he should have to pay for it.‚Äù\n\nI wish I could say that all of that made me straight up ‚Äúnope‚Äù out of the relationship. It took a lot more time and me finding out about two affairs before things finally ended. But the day of the accident and the following week were the first time I realized that she just literally didn't care about me at all, and that I deserved something better.",

I didn't even know he got married. We had just started talking and I could suddenly hear a woman talking loudly non-stop, in the background.  I did some quick thinking and realized he was in some kind of trouble.   Told him I was going to come see him, he started hemming and hawing, said I couldn't come and that he had to do this and that.  I just kept on insisting and I kept moving the goal posts on him.  Finally, after a pause, he said only tomorrow would work.  Probably thinking I couldn't make the 4.5 hour drive on such short notice, I said yes and that I'd be there tomorrow afternoon and hung up.\n\nI then got in my car and drove there, right then and there.  When I got there, he and his wife were putting the last of their things into a small U-Haul.  He was a shell of himself; emaciated,  bruised and mentally spent.  I immediately ran up to gave him a big hug, put him behind me and faced a woman that was half devil.  She tried acting friendly but was seething underneath.  She knew who I was and she tried to engage in small talk.  I ignored her and asked where my friends stuff was?  She then got pissed and starting posturing and said \"he didn't own shit.\"  I put my friend in my car and started going through the U-Haul and grabbing anything I thought might be his, while keeping a close eye on the woman.  Mainly I got his two good guitars, some clothes and shoes.\n\nCome to find out, his call to me was a last straw and it almost didn't work, when she walked in on him in the lobby of the cheap motel they were staying in, calling from the motel phone.  By the time I got him, he was basically her slave.  She regularly beat him and berated him constantly.  She had told him she would kill him if he tried to leave or if he told anyone about them.  He probably weighed 135 pounds on a good day and when I got him, he was probably about 110.  The whole dynamics of their relationship, how it began and devolved, is a story onto itself.  However, he said until about two months before, this whole abusive situation seemed normal to him.  It wasn't until she started pushing her loaded gun into his face regularly, that he started seeing the nightmare he was in.  When he first gave her an inkling he wanted out, she beat him so badly, he became unconscious.  She would then put so much fear into him, on a daily basis, that he could barely hold a rational thought.\n\nWhen I got in the car and drove off with him, after rescuing him, he just cried for a couple of hours.  He told me, he was sure she was going to kill him pretty soon and he only called me because he had come across my office number on a piece of paper, in a book he was putting into one of those little free library boxes, outside the motel office.   We mostly drove in silence because he was completely drained.  He stayed with us for a couple of months and then left for his home state.  It took him a year to get somewhere close to normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for the award.  That was very kind of you!",

Right before the movie started I messaged the girl I was seeing saying I'd catch up with her when it was over, because I hate it when people are on the phone during a movie.   \n\n\nAt one point my friend went to get a beer from the kitchen, so we paused the movie. I quickly 'thumb scrolled' once through instagram, double tapped a picture of my cousin, and then put my phone away. Phone goes off. It's a text from her asking if we could talk for a while. I said \"Sure, after the movie :)\" I get an instant response saying \"Oh, so you've got time to go on Instagram and like pictures of other girls but you don't have time to talk to me? I get it.\"  \n\n\nSo, there are several things wrong here. Firstly...how did she know I'd been on instagram? How did she know I'd liked a picture in that miniscule timeframe? By \"other girls\" I assume she meant my cousin (gross.) Why did she react that way?   \n\n\nI straight up noped and never saw her again. You might think that it wasn't a big deal and I shouldn't have let it get to me, but we'd only met up twice, and that message just threw up SO MANY flags for future issues. She proceeded to blog about how much of an asshole I was for about a year after that, ha ha!",

            "text": "Was dating a beautiful and intelligent woman from the Caribbean who had a daughter. We were so good together the first 6 months even with all the external racist bullshit that comes with an interracial relationship. We were talking about getting a place together, somewhere a little more progressive. I was already helping her with her rent, and had given her a credit card for emergencies since her finances weren't great, so it seemed like the logical next step.\n\nOne Friday night we were at a reggae concert and the lead singer of the opening act singled us out, basically taunting me and complimenting her. Afterwards he slides up with his friends and attempts to hand her his number, she was smiling and beaming but then declines. I was expecting her to be a little more forceful in her rejection,  after this guy basically shit all over our relationship. \n\nThe next day she asked if I could watch her daughter for a bit while her and the girls went to lunch. Her friends show up while I'm in the shower and one of them leaves her 2 kids as well. I come out to the living room and there's now 3 kids and nobody is answering their phones. I was already upset about her dismissive attitude with the reggae thing, but then a few hours turns into a 14 hour babysitting marathon because they didn't get back until 2am.\n\nShe was super drunk and passed out while she was on top of me. Pretty bad Saturday night. I left and went to my house. I grabbed the pile of mail since I hadn't been there for 4 days and sat down to check through it. I opened my Chase credit card statement and it's almost  $3000! She used it to pay for her car insurance in full. New tires/repairs for her car. A shopping spree at a clothing store and various smaller purchases. All within the last month. \n\nI went to her house the next afternoon and she's trying to deflect everything. She suggests we drop her daughter at her friend's house, go to dinner and talk about it. I have no idea why I agreed, but there we were sitting outside a restaurant. \n\nI told her I expect her to repay everything she's charged to my credit card. Her response was the final nail in the coffin. \"I'm not paying anything back. If you want to be with a girl like me, you need to be paying for everything.\" I told her I didn't want to be with a girl like her then. She launched into a tirade of insults and told me that she still won't pay for the charges. She started basically bragging that I actually paid for her and her friends to party last night since she charged it all to my card too. \n\nI start my car and she gets really upset \"what about dinner????\" I said she's welcome to go in alone, but I'm leaving and I want my card back now. She said it was at her home so we went back. I packed up the few things I had there and surprise surprise she refused to give me back the card. I warned her that it was a terrible idea to keep it, but she basically shouted me out of the apartment. \n\nMonday morning I contacted Chase and told them none of the charges were mine. A few days later she calls me, I'm assuming to apologize,  but no she's accusing me of stealing a CD! Seriously, a CD. I didn't hear from her until about a month later. When she was fuming about her insurance being canceled. She was less happy when I told her all the other charges were considered theft as well.\n\nChase basically covered or reversed the charges so I paid nothing. Her insurance was canceled and I like to think she had to repay all the other charges to Chase or the shops.\n\nAbout a year later I was in my car and opened a CD case, inside there were 2 CDs...Including her missing CD.\n\n\nTLDR; Ex went from dream girl to gold digging trash in the course of a weekend. Ran up thousands on my CC and refused to return it. Got a free CD for my troubles.",

She read some Tarot cards that said this was the season of moving. She informed me of this and I said, \"Okay, so.... are you going to move?\" She said, \"I'm not sure. I definitely want to move before Mercury goes into retrograde, and I want to do it soon.\" So she gives notice to move out in April, fine. Then she gives notice for March. Then she asks if she can leave next week? You know what, fine, whatever. Sure, move next week. I'll help you GTFO. Then she changes her mind and wants to move in April, then March. I told her to MAKE UP HER MIND. She finally decides she wants to leave in two weeks. Okay, fine, let me help you move out.\n\nShe then decides that \"moving\" means \"vacation\" and that she wants to go to Hawaii to relax on the beach. I tried to tell her that there were plenty of beaches where we lived (west coast USA) and she could relax there. NOPE. She wants to be on a beach in Hawaii. \n\nNow, a few things to keep in mind - she is a broke single mom that is completely irresponsible with her money. She'll blow money on a whim and never has anything saved. It's a poverty mindset. \"Why save when there's always an emergency? I'll just deal with it when it happens.\" Now, there's nothing wrong with broke single women. I get it. Being a single parent is hard. But it's that she decides to dump her kid off with her ex, take the stimmy check and use that money to book a plane ticket to Hawaii and say \"yo I'll be back in six months. Landlord, can you hold my place for me at the house? I don't want to pay rent during this time, but can you hold it until I get back?\" I told her no. She gave notice. I already posted an ad. She's leaving.\n\nIn other conversations I had with her, she expresses that \"she misses the freedom of not being a parent\" and \"wishes she could take back being a mom\". She then informed her child that she would be gone for \"up to 6 months, but wasn't sure when she would be back.\" Her child was, understandably, devastated but took the news best he could. \n\nDuring the last few days at the house, I went over to do some normal maintenance housework. While there, her son was in my way. \"MOVE. God, you're always in the way!\" she shouted at him. \"Sorry...\" her child said sheepishly. He moved and I continued about my work, but he was in my way again as I continued to work. \"HEY. YO, YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HIS WAY. God, you're SO SLOW at everything! Jesus would you move?\" He didn't reply and sulked off to his bedroom. I was thinking, \"If she's like this when I'm around, what is she like when I'm not around?!\"\n\nAfter moving out completely, her son went off to his father's place while she booked it for Hawaii. When she reached Hawaii, she texted me that \"she was sorry for being so hasty in coming out, but hoped we could remain friends.\" I told her to fuck off and never contact me again. I assumed things were over.\n\nNOPE. Within two weeks I got a request from two different landlords asking me for a rental reference for her! Like, is she INSANE?! So she told everyone she was going to Hawaii for six months, then stayed there for two weeks and came back. What the actual FUCK. I told the two landlords that I refused to give a rental reference and that I would not rent to her again. She requested a third rental reference from me from yet another landlord. When that landlord asked me for a reference, I told him, \"Could you kindly tell her to fuck off? She won't listen to me, but maybe she'll listen to a stranger.\"\n\nI never heard from her again.",

We are both lawyers, so given our schedules, dating at that point usually consisted of staying at one another‚Äôs place during the week and going out for dinner and drinks on the weekends.\n\nOne day she tells me that there was a complaint that she was drunk in court, and that there will be a hearing to determine if she can continue being assigned indigent clients by the state. For a solo practitioner, this was a huge part of her practice.\nI get a call from a doctor who asks if I‚Äôve ever noticed alcohol being a problem for her. I said I had not. Perhaps we‚Äôd close down a bar on a Friday night, but nothing problematic.\n\nLater that day, she calls me and asks to attend the hearing. I get there and it has nothing to do with retaining clients. It is a civil commitment hearing. Apparently there were multiple complaints by both other attorneys in the courthouse and her clients. Now clients often complain that an attorney isn‚Äôt spending enough time in their case. But when clients who are not paying for your services because the state is picking up the tab complain, that is a red flag.\nA judge that she argues in front of regularly hears reads the formal complaints and sends her to the state hospital for up to six months, with a re-hearing in a month.\n\nShe gets sent away immediately to the state hospital and asks me to look after her cats, as she suddenly won‚Äôt be home for months.\nAt first I feel badly for her, thinking the court must have gotten something wrong. I drive the hour to the state hospital a few times a week to visit her during no-touch visits supervised by a nurse. Because I‚Äôm a lawyer, the nurse had to stay outside a glass room.\n\nBy the time she gets let out three weeks later because Covid had hit in the interim, I had realized that all those times that we went out a little bit too late, it was because she wanted to continue drinking. I also realized that whenever she got lunch between court hearings, she was really getting vodka sodas.\nI pick her up the day she gets let out. On our drive back, I make a comment about being nominated for the‚ÄúEx-Boyfriend of the Year‚Äù Award.\nShe looks at me and says ‚Äúso you‚Äôre breaking up with me?‚Äù\n\nYup.

Mostly out of fear of what she would do to me, she threatened to take my livelihood and my son. \n\nThis was a woman I was married to for ten years. At first we were very much in love. Then I joined the army so I could afford to give us a better life. I went away for training for a year, came back to a completely different person. \n\nShe cheated on me constantly, told me she wouldn't have sex with me because I was gay. I'm not gay but she decided that was her narrative and held onto it. \n\nShe would tell me I was useless, stupid and worthless. And then for a little while she calmed down. Started being nice and even having sex with me again. Made it all seem like a mental health crisis. \n\nTurns out she had fucked a few guys without condoms and wanted to keep her security blanket in case she got pregnant again. \n\nAnd she did indeed become pregnant. I was excited. I always wanted 2 or 3 kids so the idea of a second child excited the hell out of me and made me temporarily forget all the bad stuff. \n\nThen she miscarried. And it was a bad one. Blood all over the bathroom and puke on the walls and then I had to sit with her for 10 hours because the doctors lost the ultrasound and couldn't confirm the miscarriage. I have never felt so helpless and it fucked me up for about four years. \n\nIn that time she started hitting me, telling me all her pain was my fault and bullied me into a very one sided open marriage where she could fuck whoever she wanted but went into a jealous rage anytime I found someone interesting. \n\nSo finally it's Xmas 2014. I'm damn near suicide at this point. Seriously considering my options and how I would do it while causing my death as painlessly as possible. \n\nA few days before Xmas I drop her off at the local mall to buy gifts. I ask her again as I had for years to please take some time to talk to me about the miscarriage and how I've not been able to sleep without flashbacks for four years and how I wish she would consider couples counselling. \n\nJust like everytime I had asked before, she tells me to get fucked and that I'm the only one with a problem. I'm thinking ‚Äúok we'll I guess this is my last Christmas.‚Äù\n\nThen she says the words that change everything. ‚ÄúI wish you‚Äôd grow a spine and stop being such a bitch. That baby wasn't even yours.‚Äù\n\nIt was like a light switch had been flicked. I asked her why she would keep that information from me and let me suffer for four years knowing that maybe there was a slight chance that confessing that lie might give me peace. \n\nHer response: ‚ÄúWhat's done is done.‚Äù\n\nI couldn't believe my ears. And on that last sentence she turned and walked away to buy me my Xmas present. \n\nMy Xmas present was a Big Mac meal by the way. She spent the majority of the present money for me on a $40 glass bong for the local drug addict that she was fucking. \n\nSo anyway right after she left my thoughts changed from suicide to escape. I'm not sure why it was that the final bit of info she gave me changed my whole outlook. Why that one sentence was more effective than the cheating, the lies, the hitting and the verbal abuse. It's been six years and I don't have that answer. \n\nAll I know is that at that moment I decided that I was done and needed a way out that didn't end with her getting zero consequences, my life insurance and a lot of sympathy.\n\nI decided though that I would wait until after Christmas so my son could enjoy one final Christmas with his whole family together. \n\nSo I waited. \n\nJanuary 5th, 2015: D-Day for my marriage. \n\nMy wife had been at her drug addict boyfriend's house for a few days now. I get a phone call from her asking that I please take her and her boyfriend to the local courthouse that was a 30-minute highway drive away so he could answer to charges of assault and theft. \n\nAt first, I thought ‚ÄúWhy on earth would I do that?‚Äù\n\nThen it struck me. Every time I had ever mentioned divorce in the past she would scream at me that I was a worthless piece of shit who needed to take my head out of my ass. Throw her wedding ring at me and runoff for a few hours until I felt bad and then she‚Äôd come home and ‚Äúforgive me‚Äù for thinking so negatively about our marriage. This gaslighting happened a few times and most of the time it worked. I'd always be left trying to figure out how I came out looking like a bitch. \n\nSo this time I decided I would break up with her in the car. My son was at school and I was on leave, she had nowhere to run while the car is zipping down the highway at 100kph so it was a perfect time. \n\nSo we get about halfway there and I casually tell her I‚Äôm done. I'll help her find a place, give her the kid 5 days per week and give her child support immediately. It was effectively cheaper than daycare and I had to save myself before I could save my son. I have 100% custody now but that's another story. \n\nAnyway she‚Äôs caught completely off guard and agrees to everything because A) she thinks she's getting a pretty good deal and B) she doesn't have any other options. So she says ‚ÄúOk if that's what you want.‚Äù I tell her I do and that I'm tired of fighting. \n\nShe asks me if there's anything she can do to change my mind but I knew that would just be inviting more lies and abuse so I tell her ‚Äúwhat's done is done.‚Äù mic drop. \n\nI drop her off at the courthouse and start driving home. On my way home I call my mom and in a huge emotional release tell her that I'm separating from my wife. \n\nMy mom's reaction? THANK GOD!!!",

It was a little different to what I normally wore, but I'd bought a new hat and was excited to wear it. He told me the hat didn't suit me and would suit him more, he took it off my head and wore it instead, and just trashed my outfit. We get to a forest area while on our walk and he tells me something along the lines of \"If somebody assaulted you, you'd be completely defenseless.\" I told him that my chunky shoes would protect me as I could kick them, and he swept my legs out from underneath me to prove that I couldn't defend myself. He said \"Your shoes didn't help you there, did they?\"\n\nLater, while I was back home with my parents, he called me around midnight. He did a lot of fishing for compliments, then he said \"If you could have sex with me, you would.\" I'd told this person about my sexual trauma so this hit pretty hard. I spoke to my mental health advisor at university and he told me that that was sexual harassment and physical assault and I should report him, but he's an RA, he's the person I should be reporting these things to. I just avoid him now.\n\nEdit: Okay, I've read through some comments. I have a meeting with my mental health advisor who works with the university to talk about it more. It was good to hear from other RAs too. There is unfortunately only one other RA currently, a good friend of mine who defended his behaviour in my first year so I'm not comfortable talking to him. We have limited staff on my campus as it's the rural campus for my university, but we do have security so I think I'm going to speak to someone higher up soon. Thank you to everybody, the comments have been a real kick up the butt.\n\nEdit 2: I told a couple of you guys that I was going to get some pepper spray or something similar just in case something like this happens again, but after researching it, they're actually illegal to carry in the UK.\n\nUpdate: I just spoke to someone on the accommodation team and they're going to pass it onto the wardens for me. Thank you everyone for your advice and support!",

I asked her phone number, which at that time, I‚Äôd never done before. She was excited. We talked, flirted, and exchanged numbers. I thought it went so well. I was on break and she was just getting off work and heading out. About 5 minutes after she left she texted me asking why I hadn‚Äôt texted her yet. I thought she was teasing and that it was great she was so interested. We got to know each other better, but she would always reiterate she got annoyed when I wouldn‚Äôt text back. No biggie, I‚Äôve always been a bad texter. I got a little spooked when she said her father was a police officer and that I should come over when he was working the night shift. This is where she got a little more aggressive when I said I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable coming over. All of these signs should have added up but I was just an easy going 18 year old kid. One time while a was working she was blowing up my phone, but I refused to take out my phone because I was at the service desk. All of a sudden I hear her voice behind me and I froze. I couldn‚Äôt believe she would just show up to scold me. I turn around and she‚Äôs standing there with her sister who looks very uncomfortable. She introduces me to her sister and I feel very awkward. She says something about how she wanted me to meet her and all I can think is: why now? She says ‚ÄúI came to pick up my check.‚Äù I feel a bit of relief and think: oh great, she‚Äôs not here being crazy. I gives her the check and she leans in and starts laying into me about how she‚Äôs not gonna waste her time and I need to put more effort in and text her back when she texts me. I tell her I‚Äôm obviously working, it‚Äôs the busiest time of the season, and can‚Äôt have my phone out. She lets out a big sigh and says I need to figure out my priorities. I tell her sister it was great meeting her but I gotta get back to work. They leave. My manager over hears and says this is not okay and i need to text her that this isn‚Äôt working out. She moves my shifts to times when I won‚Äôt see her. After a while she quits. Oh, and this all took place within a week and a half of meeting her.

After that he messaged me every now and then and always say we should meet one day but there was always some reason I couldn't meet him.  After a while I just got used to it and didn't think anything of it.\n\nNow a year later I'm at her house and a freak snowstorm came in and basically trapped me there for a few days.  One day I wake up first, go down and get on the computer and go to sign on to my AIM.  There it is, his screen name saved on her computer, and there's no password.   I sign on thinking I'm gonna find some evidence they've been hooking up but what I discovered was even worse.\n\nClick here to get the... jk.  No really I signed on and the only fucking name on his friends list was me.  I was the only person he had talked to and for a second I was baffled and didnt understand what that meant.  Then it hit me.... she was him.  She had made up her best friend from the moment I met her and made up all these stories.  The reason I couldn't meet him because he was her, my gf.\n\nSo yeah, I got catfished by my gf for a year before catfishing was a thing.  I confronted her, she broke down in tears and admitted she made up a friend because she didnt have any real friends and didnt want to seem weird.... I told her we were done but I was fucking trapped there by a snowstorm.

I heard both sides of the conversation and this dude was a much better man than me. She berated him for a full half hour and threatened to make sure he never saw their daughter, etc;. He remained calm and soft spoken the whole time. Literally everything she accused him of being is exactly what she was. When the conversation was over, I told her she had to go. \n\nA week later, I was on vacation and my neighbor who was watching my cats and house texted me saying she thought we had broke up. I said we had. The crazy ex was there asking for the key to my house. She told the neighbor we had reconciled and she was going to stay at my house while I was away. She tried to argue but long story short, I told the ex if she didn‚Äôt leave I was making two phone calls. The police and her ex husband‚Äôs attorney.  That was literally the last thing that was said between us, but I did send all messages and a nice email to her ex husband, which he was very grateful for. Hopefully it worked out for him in the end.",

About two weeks later, I invite her over on a Friday night to come chill with me. We chill have a few drinks.\n\nIt gets late and I ask her if she wants to stay the night. She agrees. \n\nI had a bit too much to drink, so in my head, I didn't want to try anything with her because if I was feeling fucked up, this smaller than me woman definitely was too.\n\nGo to sleep, wake up, she's still here. I wake up early so I just hang out for a bit until she wakes up. \n\nI don't have a car, but I offered, \"hey, let me know whenever you're ready, I can call you an Uber\".\n\nShe kinda brushed this off. We're talking for a bit and she brings up for the first time how she doesn't have the best family life and isn't looking to go back home at the moment.\n\nMy dumbass feels bad and let's her know she can stay another night if she wants. \n\nThis happens. I give her her space since my sober attempts at flirting seemed to have gotten shot down. \n\nOne more night turns into damn near a week. \n\nIdk what's wrong with me. Like I felt bad, but after a few days, it started feeling like she was taking advantage and my attraction for her slowly started slipping. \n\nThe kicker. When she ended up leaving, it was at like 3am. I woke up to see she was about to leave with a hoodie I let her borrow (she was wearing my underwear and socks since she hadn't brought more than a change of clothes). I groggily asked her with a half smile, \"you about to steal my hoodie?\" She answers, \"oh you didn't want me to steal it?\". When I tell you I could feel the half smile on my face drop.\n\nIt's crazy because as we were texting before we met. We were full on flirting back on forth. I really thought we were just gonna kick it and leave it at that, maybe make it a consistent thing. Nope. \n\nShe never messaged me after leaving. I was fine with never talking to her again tbh, but I told this to my older brother. He told me to at least message her and let her know that I wasn't interested because \"I wouldnt like it if someone did that to me\". \n\nI messaged her, she blocked me. End of story.",

I had a hidden bottle of 1800 tequila that I swiped from a party. He drank the entire bottle by himself, told me that he loved me, and cried because I wouldn't say it back to him. I then had to just let him stay the night because my parents would def come investigate if I was trying to drive off in the middle of the night. Once I did finally take him back, I was so uncomfortable with what happened that I tried to just ghost out of there. But he showed up every day to the yoga studio I went to to wait for me and hope I showed up. Thank god this was right before graduating from high school so I moved away pretty soon after that, but I'll never forget about those one or two weeks.",

I spilled everything to the principal. How we met, how long we were together, and how I broke it up. He believed me and told me I can get an in school restraining order on her if I wanted.

You know - the point where you can‚Äôt stand each other, but you‚Äôre too  afraid to be alone. Anyway, We had been fighting via email (this was before texting was prevalent) and I was corresponding via my work email. Things went back and forth and got nasty. I left work for the day and I don‚Äôt think we spoke for the rest of the night. When I returned to work the following day, this douche bag had sent a ‚Äúcease and desist‚Äù letter to the director of my department claiming that I was using my work email to harass him. I use air-quotes because it wasn‚Äôt from a lawyer or anything, just him using the words ‚Äúcease and desist‚Äù and claiming that I would not stop contacting him. He sent her edited exchanges and removed his parts to make it look like I was repeatedly sending him messages. This was not the case, it was completely mutual. \n\nI was hauled into my directors office with HR and my boss where they showed me his letter and questioned me about it all. Thankfully they were cool about it and recognized that he was just an idiot, but said they did have to write me up because I was breaking a rule about using company email for person use. A slap on the wrist, but the most humiliating thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me at a job. I was absolutely mortified. \n\nOf course I called him freaking out and he was a remorseless asshole about it. A few days later he called me to apologize and wanted to make up again. I noped out of that situation real fast and never looked back. I‚Äôm not quite sure what he was thinking...You tried to have me fired from my job, embarrassed me in front of my upper management and now we‚Äôre just just gonna go on like nothing happened?

She didn't see being 1 in a million as a good thing, that I chose to spend my time with her and no one else, she wanted me to have no choice but to be attracted to only her for superficial reasons.

She was convinced she was a gay viking in her past life and that magic potions, fortune-telling, and curses worked. I've looked past horoscopes and Buddhism appropriation but that's too much for me.\n6. Threw a tantrum about us not going out to a restaurant on Valentine's day (didn't want us to catch COVID so I wanted us to cook together instead) and about me only spending like 200 bucks on the day and her gifts. I graduated and couldn't find work for like 8 months because of COVID, just got my first entry-level engineering job, I don't have that kind of fucking money.\n7. Started suckling on my thumb after sex and went completely non-verbal. Turns out she was into age-play and decided to involve me without letting me know first.\n8. She \"decided\" we would have an open relationship. Well, at least she announced she was going to cheat before she did it. Glad she gave me the opportunity to dump her first :)\n9. She decided she would go out to dinners with rich men for money. Apparently fucking after paid extra and she didn't have time to discuss with me.\n10. She cheated.\n11. She also cheated.\n12. She cheated too.\n13. And like 10-20 women who thought that a relationship is trading sex for dates and gifts. Never surprised me, took me out anywhere, got me anything, or otherwise spent a dime on me - that's apparently my job. Apparently her job is letting me fuck her after I spent enough money. Some of them even identified as feminists.",

It was really weird. I felt like he was always comparing me to her. I ended that very quickly\n\nAnother guy I dated in college - we had been friends for a long time. He was super sweet, really nice, very caring and understanding but he was very insecure and extra needy. I saw him ALL the time. And he would constantly text me and call me. It was starting to be too much and one day he had called me or texted me (I don‚Äôt remember) and I didn‚Äôt answer/respond. So he drove by my house to see if I was home. He knew where I lived so that didn‚Äôt matter but the neediness was too much so I ended that. \n\nThis one may seem kind of callous. A guy I dated a few years after college. I was like 23ish - he actually had a degenerative medical condition that if we stayed the course - got married, etc He would at some point need a caregiver.

I decided the answer was ‚Äúno.‚Äù We were also long distance - he lived like 2 hours away so that factored in.

She would absolutely flip out about anything at any time, and there was no telling what would trigger her. She'd either start crying out of the blue, or get extremely angry, throw things, scream at me, that kind of stuff. \n\nWell, she was super excited to see that movie, so I took her the weekend it premiered. I realized that she acted exactly like Kate Hudson when she was trying to get Matthew McConaughey to break up with her. There's one scene when he's playing poker at his place with a few friends, and she's serving snacks. He asks her something, and she just flings the food off of the tray. That exact thing happened with me, and this girl like six months previous. That's the most specific example in the movie, but the rest of it made me feel like someone was following me around, taking notes, and then pitched my life story to a studio. It was insane.\n\nWhen that scene happened, my stomach felt like it was doing cartwheels. I looked over at her, and she had this huge smile on her face like she was really into, and enjoying it. She had no idea that we were watching her on screen. \n\nI had to take a couple days to get up the courage because it was the first real breakup I was about to attempt, but I finally went through with it. \n\nI'm also stupid, and we got back together a few months later which is a whole other story. That obviously didn't work out for very long. We had a one night stand years down the road after we broke up the second time when she contacted me out of the blue. She seemed much better by then because she'd been in pretty intensive therapy for a long time, but I wasn't about to get back into that roller coaster either way.",

I was about 15-16 and he was 17 ish when he would tell me those things. I‚Äôm overweight and I used to be into powerlifting, and it hurt a lot when he told me that men didn‚Äôt like me and I wondered if my bf would hate me. Plot twist, bf doesn‚Äôt mind being carried bridal style and enjoys my big stomach and thighs.\n\nHe was also incredibly racist. He got jumped once (while with a black friend, mind you) by two or three guys that he said ‚Äúsmelled black‚Äù and immediately after told me that he ‚Äúf***ing hates n*****s‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt drop him after that, but I started to distance myself. \n\nHe would guilt me into giving him physical affection and preyed on my naivety when it came to real world issues. ‚ÄúOh, my mother hasn‚Äôt massaged me in years despite my leg being crippled...I miss being hugged, I‚Äôm all alone and everyone hates me...‚Äù, that sort of thing. Again, being like 16, I thought I had to do something because no one else would. I would bring him lunches every day because he would complain about not eating, then proceed to break my containers and give away my food because it‚Äôs ‚Äúhis personality to share, and [I] should know that he always gives this to others‚Äù. \n\nHe would tell me constantly to break up with my bf or take a break. I listened a couple times, and we both went on breaks. It sucked. Asshole dude guilted me into kissing him once and I felt sick to my stomach. He had been talking about how he was so alone and no one would kiss him but I could and all this horrible bullcrap and of course, me being a sheltered 16 year old, kissed him. I told my bf immediately afterward and I don‚Äôt know why but he forgave me (likely because me and him had only been together about 3-4 months at the time). My sweetheart‚Äôs a saint. \n\nHe was hardcore into lolicon and thought kids could have sex once they got their periods. I got my first period at 8 years old due to childhood obesity. He knew this. He also knew that I had been sexually assaulted in class my freshmen year. \n\nThe pre-breaking point was when I was 17. He called me out of nowhere telling me that he would either call me or a hotline and he chose me, with the sound of a busy road behind him. I shut him out for a few days after that and I started to feel happier, but I told him that I would give him another chance (mainly because he wouldn‚Äôt shut up about how lonely he was) if he never did that again. He told me I should‚Äôve known that he wouldn‚Äôt have done anything and it was my fault I was anxious over nothing. I sucked it up and kept going. \n\nAbout 3 days afterward it came out that he was trying to hook up with a drug-addicted freshman girl with family issues. He was nearly 19 and she had just turned 15. I didn‚Äôt even like the girl (had a health class with her senior year) but I wouldn‚Äôt wish what I had gone through on her.\n\nI haven‚Äôt spoken to him since. I tried to look past so many things he did (racism, sexism, general horrible-ness) and justified it to myself as we‚Äôre living in the South, maybe that‚Äôs just his parents influencing him? But I truly and honestly could not excuse him taking advantage of a minor the way he tried to do. I was a horrible person when I was around him and I‚Äôm so happy he‚Äôs out of my life now. \n\nI hope he reads this and feels awful. Nasty cunt.",

Though, I suppose that is fine, as I was beginning to notice a few red flags, mainly with drinking, something I suspect she gained from her parents. One day I came over after having not seen her for a weekend, a weekend where she was ridiculously quiet, and she said all she did was clean her place and see her sister. Their was something crazy like 6 empty 24 packs of beer. On Halloween we went to a party for her two daughters, but neither her son (14ish) nor I wanted to be there. Her son asked about going home and I said I'd be happy to stay at the house with him. So she dropped us off and went back to the party saying she would be back home  in like 2 hours because she was really didn't want to be their either and this was for her daugters to socialize. 6 hours later, around 2am and zero texts later, nor did she answer her son's phone call (both of us worried) she finally shows up. She smelled like smoke (she was suppose to be stopping) and was obviously drunk (which means she drove her 2 daughters home drunk). I made a passive question about drinking and she said she had like 5 or 6 (which was the # of beers I took for us) but I suspect she had more. I don't recall exactly what happened but I made some sort of face to her response I guess and she flipped her shit on me about how it wasn't my place to question her and that she was an adult. I should have ended it here, but we had plans a week later to go on a trip with my mother. It was a birthday thing my mom wanted to do and she had offered to pay for the hotel room so I felt kind of stuck.\n\nThe moment things ended was after a trip. Which was 100% not planned. We got into a huge fight driving down and then the following 2 or 3 days were actually really good and I thought we actually made some real progress. The trip was really rough but I driving home I felt relieved. Once we were nearly home (she had a lot of conference calls to tqke on the drive home) I told her I was willing to give her some space, which is something she had asked for recently. My only request was that we still spend the holidays together. She flat out refused. I spent 10 months of my life on her, and she just refused to letting me spend time with her and her family on the holidays and with everything else I had finally hit the wall.\n\nWhen we got back to her place, I grabbed my stuff  and said it was over.

I got upset, grabbed her shoulders to turn he towards me and beg her to listen that my mental health is very unwell and she swiped my hands off. I realized quickly I shouldnt have grabbed her, backed up and apologized. Normally this is where someone would either go away, or be upset and tell me not to do that, right? Instead, she threatened me. She told me that she would \"break me in half\" and she told me several times. She spent what felt like forever physically threatening me. \n\nShe would get wasted and force me to feed her (like 2-3 times a week). If she wanted two grilled cheeses and I brought her one, she would refuse to eat the first one. She would ask for two pizzas and yell if I told her she probably wont eat both, even if I told her I would make the second one upon the completion of the first. \n\nShe would lay on the floor in random crevices (eg between couch and dresser) then beg me to help her out. She weighed a solid 60-80lbs more than me and I couldn't lift her. She also wouldnt use her arms or legs to attempt to get up, just laugh and beg me to get her out when I physically couldnt. \n\nShe would get drunk and yell at me for not being the boyfriend she wanted and when I asked what she wants from me she would vaguely insist that I \"be a man\". She would give examples of what her ex (whom she cheated on me with the first time dated) would do, and I cant drive so I was unable to fulfill any request. \n\nShe sleep deprived me. I had to play with her hair until she fell asleep. If I stopped or slowed, she would snap. If I fell asleep, she would wake me up to continue. If I managed to get her to sleep then fell asleep and snored, she would wake me up pissed and make me start over again.\n\nOne time she punched me. Several times in a row. I kept telling her stop, it's not funny, this isnt a joke, please dont punch me, and she just kept laughing. She just laughed and laughed the more I pleaded and revoked my consent. \n\nShe barely fucked me. Which I could have tolerated if it were just her depression. Instead, she was masturbating every time I was gone and actively ogling other people who worked at our store, saying how she wants them to do this and that to her. Yet, she told me no every time.\n\nOne time she wanted to fuck and I was tired so I said no. She legitimately got angry and told me off for rejecting her the first and only time I ever have.

            "text": "tl;dr A woman I'd started dating got rip-roaring drunk, vomited on the floor of the bar, and accused me of raping her to my co-worker. \n\nIn '96 was a bartender, dating a girl who was borderline alcoholic (I didn't know her quite well enough to be sure yet). On her birthday night she and her friends ate and drank at a Mexican place, then came to my bar to pick me up after my shift (I was the early shift). The next bartender--a sketchy prick who I think had designs on seducing her--gave her a pitcher of Red Devils, so of course we don't leave. I couldn't drink at the time because I wasn't yet medically controlled with my epilepsy, so she went to work on it herself. She was already tipsy when she walked in and she wouldn't listen to me begging her to leave. Then she throws up in the bathroom. Now, I'm off my shift so it's technically not my problem, but the next bartender nopes out of cleaning it, saying \"It's your girlfriend dude.\" \n\nI can't describe to you what it's like to clean up burrito/Red Devil vomit. Your imagination truly can't make it much worse than reality.\n\nSo then she's feeling horrible about herself, weeping all over the place. I walk her home (she lives about ten blocks from there). The whole time she's refusing to continue, sitting on people's stoops and wailing that she doesn't deserve me and to leave her there. I am obviously not leaving her alone in this state. A ten-minute walk takes an hour. I get her up her stairs, put her in bed on her side, sit for a bit to make sure she falls asleep okay. I consider staying but I don't have my epilepsy meds with me which sets me up for a seizure. So I leave, going to a nearby bus stop. And I wait. And wait. No bus. It's pre-Uber and pre-cell phones, so I go back to my bar to call for a car service from there. \n\nI walk in and the bartender looks at me like I'm the biggest piece of shit walking the earth. \"I can't believe you just walk back in here after what you did,\" he says. As sketchy as he is, he's not confrontational, so I'm taken aback. I ask for clarification, he says that the girl called him and told him everything--how I walked her home and forced myself on her. She must have awakened and gotten angry that I wasn't still there and that's how she took it out on me? I don't know.  We never had an in-depth conversation about it. I broke up with her over the phone. I wasn't mature enough at the time to bring it up, or to suggest that she get help, I just called her at work and told her it was over. \n\nEpilogue: there was a low-level mob guy named Cookie that was a regular of mine at the bar before and after this. Although he could be a bully, he could be a nice guy too; he was just one of those guys you had to deal with. Well, he stopped coming in at one point, and I didn't see him for months. Then he came in and said, \"Hey, Mr. Limprichard, we gotta talk.\" (He always called me Mr. \\[first name\\]). Turns out he started dating the same woman and she told him what I \"did\". He stopped coming back into my bar because if he saw me he would kill me. Then one night she told him to meet her at a local bar known to be a cop joint. He went up to her and tried to get her attention by touching her elbow. She turned around, screaming at him about not touching her. The cops pulled him out of the bar and told him they'd kick the shit out of him if he ever returned. And that was the last he'd heard from her. So he wanted to come and apologize--I suppose for believing her story. \n\nShe was a fucked up unit, and something terrible must have happened to her to make her like that. I still wonder how she is. Can't search for her on the internet, as I had long forgotten her last name by the time social media was ubiquitous.",

This is during covid in July last year,  and I didn't feel comfortable going out to eat at the places that decided they were smarter than the CDC, and stayed open with outdoor dining. My ex was adamant that she be taken out for her birthday. I said no but I would order groceries and make her a great meal instead (I like to think I'm a pretty good cook) to which she said \"no, I want to be served and have drinks made for me\" I compromised with taking her wherever she wanted, with whatever friend she wanted, so long as she was safe covid wise.  She decides to take my roommate's girlfriend, whom I absolutely hate, and go to a small Mexican restaurant by our apartment. I drop them off, give her my credit card so they can order whatever they want for her birthday, and just enjoy a day at home with my roommate playing video games. \n\nAround 5 HOURS later my ex calls me and is just hammered. I mean slurred speech, nonstop giggling (which was like nails on a chalkboard to me), and keeping me on the phone while she is ordering more drinks even though she wants to be picked up. Here is where I was really questioning the relationship and her sensibilities, drunk or not. She was ordering tequila shots from the server, who I could here over the phone, was saying \"more? Okay!\" Which was weird to me because THAT RESTAURANT ONLY SERVES BEER. \n\nI go to pick her up, driving fast as fuck. I get there. She has already paid and left...  I think \"oh great a drunk is out here on the street somewhere with the idiot gf of my roommate's and now I have to weekend at bernies them both off the street.  I find them not far from the restaurant, thank God, and notice my ex has blood and scratches on her face. She had tripped and fell on her face just walking out of the damn restaurant and decided she was going to walk to the idiot's mom's house \"just down the street\" to clean up. I take them both home and get my ex cleaned up and put her to bed hoping to sober her up before dinner. Oh yeah, this was all before about 5pm on a Thursday!\n\nI let her sleep, or so I thought, and go back to playing video games with my roommate. Later I hear her crying in the bedroom while on the phone with someone. I don't just mean little tears but really crying to this person as if someone died. I go to see what was up, she hands me MY phone and says \"here talk to your mom\" gets her stuff and leaves the apartment, still VERY DRUNK. Apparently she woke up shortly after I put her to bed, saw her face and stuff was bruised and scraped up, freaked out, and called my parents telling them I had beaten her. My mom is very calm on the phone and asks me \"I know the answer but, did you hit her? How much has she had to drink?\" I told her no and A LOT. And my mom in her infinite wisdom tells me right before hanging up, \"you need to break up with her NOW\" and my mom is quite possibly the most caring and understanding woman I have ever known and she was LIVID.\n\nI find out my ex went to her best friend's that night so I went to pick her up in the morning (now her birthday) and asked her if she remembered what happened, she said no, and I said \"well I wish I couldn't remember it either, I don't want you in my life anymore.\"\n\nThere were tears on her part but after that day and previous incidents, mostly including alcohol, I was fed up with the woman.\n\nLater on I found out she had spent $275 in total on their lunch and drinks, of which they were being charged for tequila which the restaurant didn't have a license to serve and was apparently the server's own stash he kept in his car, and was charging them $10 a shot for. I ended up calling the restaurant and having to threaten litigation because of this dillweed. But all in all a better day then the last with my ex.",

But I do know there is a short list of Nevers with guns that include not pointing it at some thing you are not willing to destroy, be aware of what is on the other side of your target, always treat a gun as if it is loaded... I brought it up to him the next day, bought him dinner and sat him down to talk about it. He refused to acknowledge what he did was bad. And that was when i came to terms that his behavior was not going to change in that way and I should not be around him anymore.

            "text": "I went out with this girl a couple times and we had some nice conversations and I was enjoying being with her. \n\nTo give context we went to a bar and talked for a few hours went back to her place and then did the same a couple days later, not having slept together but just fooling around a little. Both times we hung out when we went to her place and messed around in her room and we‚Äôd basically done everything besides actual penetration so not quite sex. So I‚Äôm just enjoying what we‚Äôre doing but she keeps apologizing for not having sex with me and how she‚Äôs a tease. I tell her time and time again that if she doesn‚Äôt want to have sex that‚Äôs totally cool and that she shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty or that she owes me anything because it‚Äôs her choice. \n\nAnyway, she keeps going on about it for the rest of the night and I didn‚Äôt really think much of it like whatever maybe she‚Äôs just trying to be flirty in some odd way. The following week she‚Äôs messaging me to hangout every day, and at the time it was like mid semester so I was quite busy with school so I was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to see you but I‚Äôm really busy rn, wanna come over Saturday night?‚Äù Or something like that. For context, I would‚Äôve invited her Friday night but by Friday I felt pretty exhausted from the week and always had these long ass stupid labs Friday but anyway Friday night comes and she texts me asking if she can come over. I tell her yeah cause why not I‚Äôd finished my work and I just should suck it up and be grateful that a girl (beautiful girl to say the least) wants to hangout with me. Anyway, she comes to my apartment and she‚Äôs wasted. She comes into my room and falls over, I help her up and she starts apologizing about being drunk and asking if I‚Äôm mad at her. I tell her that I‚Äôm obviously not mad cause why would I be mad that she was drinking with her friends like I‚Äôm not gonna be mad you were drinking with your friends lol just do you whatever. Then it starts to get weird, she starts BEGGING me to have sex with her. Groping my crouch and licking her lips trying to signal she‚Äôd give me a BJ and trying to undress. I honestly never thought I‚Äôd have a beautiful girl demanding me to have sex with her while trying to undress me but OBVIOUSLY I‚Äôm not gonna take advantage of this drunk girl cause that would be horrible and disgusting. But of course because I‚Äôm attracted to her I had a boner cause she was trying to rub my crouch and stuff (I can‚Äôt control it she was really pretty üòû) so I‚Äôm literally stopping her from undressing me and undressing herself and you honest to god would think she was in a porno or something like she tried everything in the book from sitting on the floor with the bj eyes and face to pretending to be stuck on my bed lmao. I‚Äôm not gonna lie I liked the attention but I finally convinced her to drink some water and let me walk her back to her place to put her to bed. I couldn‚Äôt count the number of times she asked if I was mad at her or angry that she‚Äôs drunk and saying I‚Äôm such a great guy for not taking advantage of her. Like the fuck, if THIS is the bar for being a great guy of not raping someone that‚Äôs pretty fucking sad and low. I genuinely wasn‚Äôt upset or mad cause why would I? I have no right in being angry, if anything I thought it was kinda funny and obviously didn‚Äôt see it as a big deal like it seemed she wanted/expected me to yell at her or something. After that I kinda ghosted her (I know I‚Äôm a cunt) cause I was really busy plus kinda weirded out so I just was like fuck that lol. \n\n\nMy thoughts are now that she must‚Äôve been in a shit relationship before seeing me which makes me really sad cause it always seemed like she expected me to yell at her and get angry about not wanting to have sex but I honestly have no idea it was so odd. I know this world is filled with cunt bags that wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to have sex with a drunk girl ‚Äúcause she was asking‚Äù and get mad at a girl for ‚Äúteasing‚Äù them but god the thought of her expecting me to be angry about these things just made me feel gross. Maybe she had some other train of thought, hard to say.\n\n\n\nTldr: girl was really clingy and kept apologizing for not having sex with me and shows up drunk one day demanding sex.",

High school friend and I were catching up and having some laughs, and despite trying to include everyone in the conversation, my gf and her friends were not having it. Afterwards I get a text that said \"I didn't appreciate lunch today. My roommates were not impressed with you.\" And I was like, \"ok, fuck this.\" And dropped out immediately.

Dated about 18 months, lived in the same neighborhood, and commuted 45 minutes each way everyday for school together. \n\nIt was on a Thursday - I (m) was a junior in Precalc when a guy I particularly disliked randomly whipped out his phone and started sharing text messages that my girlfriend sent him. Now this guy wasn‚Äôt anyone special, he just happened to sit next to my girlfriend when they had band class because they were both equally bad at the clarinet. I just didn‚Äôt like the guy because he was squirrelly and obviously had a thing for my then girlfriend.\n\nBut the messages on his phone were very attention grabbing. It was almost exclusively her talking about wanting to kill herself and how she cut her self. I was very shocked because these were things that she hadn‚Äôt even confided in me and here this dope is bragging about it. I check her contact on his phone to make sure it was even her phone number first. It was so I ‚Äúconfronted‚Äù her on the ride home. \n\nObviously I tried to be respectful about the topic but sort of just expressed my curiosity as to why she had chosen to not tell ME these things if she needed someone to talk with. She proceeded to matter-of-factly tell me that she has multiple time and I ‚Äújust wouldn‚Äôt listen‚Äù.  \n\nNow I can be a dumb guy sometimes, sure, but I like to think I‚Äôm pretty empathetic. Also, at the time I was REALLY interested in this girl. She was my ‚Äúfirst‚Äù for many milestones of my life like or not. She definitely did not attempt to tell me these things. \n\nBy the time we made it to our neighborhood, I was confident I wanted to break up because I  just felt really betrayed. At the time I would have preferred her to cheat on me sexually then to confide in someone else such an intimate personal ‚Äúsecret.‚Äù I told her that I would just find another ride to school from now on.\n\nAt the time I was 16 or 17 and knew that it had gotten way too big for me to handle. She was dealing with her own problems And it wasn‚Äôt really my place to help her with those issues. \n\nShe didn‚Äôt show up to school on Friday and I was really worried but kind of figured she would get over it. I distinctly remember one of my friends fist bumping me when she walked into class on Monday. ‚ÄúCongrats bro she didn‚Äôt kill herself.‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm a dark humored fellow I really apologize. Tbf I thought she was too. I‚Äôm realizing now maybe it wasn‚Äôt humor for her.\n\nI do often think back and wonder if maybe I just wasn‚Äôt listening hard enough... or maybe if had just tried harder I dont know‚Äî- but no. You can‚Äôt fix others they gotta do that themselves. Plus, the text message I read on that guys phone were so much more, explicit, obvious, and to the point than anything else she had spoken to me about the subject. If she would have spoken about it the way she spoke to him I would have understood the conversation immediately‚Äî in fact I did when I read her words in his phone. So I know she didn‚Äôt try to tell me. She just lied afterwards for some reason. \n\nShe started dating another guy like 3 months later and they have been together for like 5 years. I didn‚Äôt think it would last but props to them.\n\nAbout once a year I check her social media to make sure she is still alive. She is, and she is very open and posts about depression and mental health awareness. \n\nSeems like it all worked out looking back now",

She said she needed my help with bills so I helped out by paying what I could which would leave me broke, but she made nearly twice as much as I did and she never disclosed her expenses with me despite her need for financial help. She expected me to do all the chores and look after her dog (I loved that dog and would have done it anyways) but wouldn't lift a finger or even refill my cats water dish.

As I go around the house the smell gets fainter and fainter... until I come back to my bedroom.   \n\n\nIt was her. She reeked something fierce, and to this day I don't know of what or how - mayhaps she hadn't showered (who even goes on dates without showering) or I don't know, but I had to clench my jaws so I wouldn't puke in my mouth. I made up some story that I'm not over my ex yet and it wouldn't be fair to her for me to just jump into a new relationship while thinking of someone else.",

He insists on going to the mall so that I can help him to choose a couple of shirts that are ‚Äúin my taste‚Äù. After a while we start discussing the cinematography and I say ‚ÄúI love Bruce Willis for a long time‚Äù. He gets super angry, pulls my hand, put it on his head and start screaming (not jokingly) that he is better, he even has hair. I nod and look for the first opportunity to nope out by a public transport. As soon as the bus door closes I send the message that I am sorry, I am not interested, there will be no third date. He starts calling/messaging huge texts - I block him. He starts to message my mother and my best friend whom he found through social media asking them to talk to me so I will reconsider. They ignore him until he stops.\nA month passes. I live in the university dorm. Access to the dorm is restricted by babushka-concierge. To visit someone in the dorm, you need the host in the hall and leave your id with her. Even if I had long-term boyfriends who were visiting regularly - I still had to go downstairs and verify they are my guests. Yet, somehow I am chilling in a towel after the shower, hear some knock into my room, open the door and my ‚Äúsecond date‚Äù storms into the room with ‚ÄúI needed to talk‚Äù attitude. I am terrified. He absolutely did not know where I live (only university name), there is no info online on my address, I have no clue how he got through the strict babushka and there is only a towel on me. No neighbours are there so no one will hear my screams in case of escalation. I try to collect myself, ask him to leave my room and wait for me in the shared gathering room on the floor. Thankfully, he listens. I put my clothes on and go there. For next two hours, I listen to his complains about ex-girlfriends, that no one understands him and one day he will become rich and successful and all the girls (including me) will regret they treated them that way. I nod to everything, suggest him to take some time to heal his trauma and one day he will meet ‚Äúthe one‚Äù. And I will regret as anyone else. But now I am just not ready for serious relationships with such an impressive guy like him. He calms down, says me ‚Äúforever good bye‚Äù and leaves. Never saw him again. Turns out he found my address through relatives in police and convinced-charmed the ‚Äúbabushka‚Äù it is an emergency visit. I am still traumatized by the moment when he storms in and I am in the towel only. I am lucky it did not escalate.",

He wanted a booty call, but during the visit I received a phone call from my ex, who was crying and I was completely out of the mood. (It happens, but not anymore! Yay)\n\nThe guy who was visiting had a joint with me and then after telling him I wasn't in the mood and I'm cool if we just hang out. He told me it was fine and so on. Around 5/10 minutes later he tried to bet me that if he beat me at Call of Duty that I would sleep with him. I laughed it off and said he wouldn't beat me, and I'm not betting (and he didn't win at all). He asked me after this about 5/6 times until I turned around and said \"What's the matter with you? Can't you take no for an answer?\" He then promptly said that he thought he should leave, I agreed and walked him to the door, and gave him directions to leave the building. \n\nOH BUT IT DIDN'T END THERE. \n\nHe sat outside in his van for the next 3/4 hours texting me asking me to change my mind and that he was waiting. Safe to say, my mind did not change and after that, I didn't invite him over every again. \n\nAnother story is a about a friend with benefits who I worked with - we were literally just that. I couldn't get into a relationship with him simply because after sex/whenever he sweated it smelt like the worst thing on earth. I couldn't ever imagine waking up to that all the time. He also ended up being a very manipulative liar, who lied to my face on a couple of occasions. When I found out, I called him out on his bullshit, blocked him and ignored his calls. Fortunately, I'd secured a new job/promotion and wasn't in the same office anymore. I saw him on a 'work night out' and he got drunk and asked if I was going to ignore him, and I said that he lied to my face, which shows no respect, so yes. I was going to ignore him.

He said he just wanted to hook up, cool. First date, we do.\n\nOne of the other guys I was seeing had quickly become a good friend. Informed him of this as well (didn't have to; I'm just an open person).\n\nSecond date rolls around. He's hung up on this new friend. Keeps interrogating me about him. I have to keep telling him we're hooking up, not in a relationship, and this guy is my pal. So it doesn't concern him.\n\nThird date. I thought it was just us. Nope. Family dinner with his dad, his gf, his sister, and her bf, surprise! I play it cool but I'm a bit miffed. Turns out he's told everyone I'm his gf. At this point I'm just here for food, drinks, and a fuck then I'll be ghosting him. In a McDs run, I talk to him about the fact that telling everyone I'm his gf when I'm not is not ok. We get back, his dad is heading to bed with his gf but first takes the 4 of us aside and informs us we're not allowed to have sex under his roof while his gf is over, because they're gonna fuck, so we're \"not allowed\" (?? Idek).\n\nI ask the guy for another rum and Coke (which we had been drinking all night). Guess that was the tipping point for him. He starts absolutely fucking BAWLING that I'm friends with a guy, that I'm poly, that I don't want to be his gf, and that oh, by the way, he's a furry and I'm discriminating against him (???!!??).\n\nI calm him down. I'm about to leave and we're talking. He initiates making out (and he's sobered up a bit at this point thank god). So I think \"fuck it\" and go with it. You can already hear his sister and dad and their respective partners going at it (weird, but \"fuck it\" had become my mantra at this point). I leave shortly after.\n\nThe next day, he texts and wants me to come over, and I tell him I'm out shopping with my new friend. He fucking LOSES it. Walls of texts. How can I betray him, I'm just doing this because he's a furry, I'm a slut, oh btw my dad's mad at you for having sex here when he told you not to so I disrespected his dad and I'm not allowed back til I apologize, also how dare I come into his house and \"vandalize\" their belongings (I peeled a label off an empty bottle and threw it out) and drink \"all\" their liquor (I had one extra drink lmao).\n\nI told him to grow the fuck up because no one wants a spoiled manbaby as a partner. Blocked him and now I don't date any guys that are over 2 years younger than me LOL. Probably should've ditched him sooner but I learned my lesson lmao",

            "text": "Short ver: My girlfriend lied about going to prom with me so she could go to prom with her friends and a guy who got her an XBox\n\nLong version: Around when my school started to sell prom tickets I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to go to my prom together (since we were going to separate high schools). I knew her family didn‚Äôt have a lot of money, and she was working so I wanted to make sure she didn‚Äôt have to stress about paying for any of the fees. I told her I would pay for everything but her dress if she would be able to come. She said on the day the prom would be (which was maybe a month or so away) she would be \n1. Busy with work\n2. Couldn‚Äôt buy a dress\n3. Her parents had grounded her for punching her brother (already questionable)\nI said ok and since I didn‚Äôt want her to feel left out I didn‚Äôt buy tickets, I felt bad and considered buying a dress for her but didn‚Äôt because she listed the other two reasons.\n\nAround the time of the prom, but not on the same day, I call her to ask if she go to the play I was going to be in. I offered to pay for her ticket since I didn‚Äôt know if that would be an issue for her. She replies with\n\n‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm going to prom with my friends around then, and I have to work.‚Äù \n\nI was disappointed that she couldn‚Äôt go before I realized that she said she was grounded and couldn‚Äôt go to prom. I ask her about why she could go to her own prom and not mine when I offered, and how come she suddenly could go. She replied with \n\n‚ÄúOh my parents said it was ok to go since I was nice to my brothers.‚Äù \n\nSo apparently all three of those problems were conveniently solved in the time. She had lied to me on multiple occasions before this, admitted to stealing, bragged about abusing her brothers, and with this final straw I was done with her. \n\nXbox man part:\n\nOnce she transferred to the other school she would text me near everyday saying that she had no friends and everyone hated her. I tried to comfort her but out of nowhere she seemed fine one day. A few days later she tells me she got an XBox from the really nice guy who wanted to be her friend. Not just any Xbox, the XBox One right after it had come out. Even if it was second hand from someone, you don‚Äôt just give a $500 console to someone who‚Äôs just your friend. I told her to give it back as he‚Äôs probably not just doing it to be nice. She refuses to give it back, saying that he would never try to get with her. \n\nI might have been a bit jealous at the time but I said you can‚Äôt just take an XBox from some guy you just met, especially when we were in a relationship. Again she refuses, saying I was just overreacting and he knew that we were in a relationship... and she begins to tell me how he‚Äôs complimented her several times but only as friends. Calling her cute and stuff similar. She wouldn‚Äôt listen to me so I just gave it up.\n\nI broke up with her over text after the prom incident, I was still hesitant to break up even though she showed dozens of red flags but I was scared to be alone. Please dudes, being alone is better than being someone who takes advantage of you. Thanks for reading",

We had quite a few mutual friends who were also coworkers. He was the over jealous type, to the point where a guy would just say hello to me and it would cause issues. But girls could hang all over him and I wasn't allowed to get mad about that. We had a few little arguments here and there, but nothing that we couldn't solve after taking time to calm down and actually communicate with each other. \n\n\nEx and I got invited to hang out with a couple coworkers on our day off. I was still fairly new to the area so I was excited to have people to socialize with outside of work. I really wanted to go, he kinda begrudgingly agreed to go. So we were supposed to meet them at a casual diner place for dinner, but ex decided to day drink all day and get drunk off his ass before dinner time. I still wanted to go out, he got mad that I didn't want to stay home with him. He told me \"if I don't go out, you shouldn't go either.\" Uhh no sorry dude, you decided to get drunk. You can hang out at home playing videogames. I'm gonna go hang out with friends.\n\n\nNot even 15 minutes after I get to the restaurant, he's blowing up my phone with texts telling me I'm a bitch and I must be cheating because why else would I go out without him? I ignored him for a bit which only made him angrier. I couldn't help it though, I finally snapped and texted back something snarky about how I had to go out and test drive a few options because clearly I can't be trusted to be out at a diner for 15mins with friends from work. He flipped out and demanded I get back home immediately. I stayed at the restaurant, ate my dinner, had a good time chatting with friends, then finally went back home. To say he was in a bad mood was an understatement.\n\n\nWe argued. A lot. He was still drinking. Drink after drink after drink. He could barely stand up on his own two feet but he wouldn't just drop the argument and call it a night. I tried just sitting in the living room to get some space, but he kept coming back out from the bedroom and arguing. I had enough, told him I was gonna go stay at a friend's house till he sobered up in the morning so we could actually discuss this calmly. I wasn't about to sit there all night getting yelled at. He took great offense to this and tried to block me from leaving. I went to step around him and he choke slammed me into the wall. I managed to get free and ran out of the house. I stayed with my friend for about a week before I felt okay enough to go get some of my most important belongings since I ran out of there with just my keys and wallet.\n\n\nI didn't realize how toxic the relationship really was until I got out.",

About a month in, she texts me one night and says she‚Äôs in love with me and asks me if I felt the same. I have a hard time with emotions and affection in general and also we‚Äôd only been sorta-dating for a month so I told her I needed more time to develop stronger feelings, assuming I would even fall in love with her. I guess she didn‚Äôt like that so she blew up at me over text and threatened to come burn my house down. She didn‚Äôt go through with it though. \n\nThere was this other girl I dated in the first half of high school. Turns out she  was gaslighting and abusing me the whole time but I couldn‚Äôt see it at the moment. I also never really liked her, I just told myself I did because that‚Äôs just what people do. I‚Äôm also trans (afab, but now transmasc). I came out to a lot of our friends one afternoon and she pulled me aside (literally) and told me I had to stop telling people I was trans because she didn‚Äôt want to be known as someone who was dating a trans person. I told her that we weren‚Äôt dating anymore and I haven‚Äôt talked to her since. \n\nIn my freshman year of high school, I dated this guy from the same cross country team as me. He told me he was a sophomore but I found out a couple weeks later he was actually a senior. I stopped talking directly to him after that. \n\nJust this past January I went on a couple dates with a girl from a neighboring college. It was actually going pretty well and I enjoyed being around her until she moved into an apartment. We were watching a movie and then we started making out. She took off my shirt without any consent. Backstory: I have some scars on my chest/back/shoulders because my dad was really abusive growing up. She asked, very loudly, ‚ÄúWhat the hell happened?‚Äù She‚Äôs from one of well-off families who actually like each other and when I told her they were from my dad growing up, she told me I was a liar. Then she told me I was too hot to be trans and that I‚Äôm actually still a girl because she was a lesbian so the fact that she liked me means I‚Äôm a girl. Then she started taking my pants off, again without consent. I pushed her off me, put my clothes on, and drove away. \n\nI guess I just attract toxic people?",

I only hung out with her with other women for the first few months I knew her because these were women focused groups. So eventually we start hanging out just to ya know socialize. She says she‚Äôs new in town and doesn‚Äôt know anyone so I introduce her to my friends. We‚Äôre young and college age so we‚Äôre drinking in a bar. Two of my guy friends are chatting her up and these guys, who have been friends for ages, end up getting into an honest to god fist fight over their jealousy over her, which is NOT something typical for our crew. This was a super woke crew before that was even a word. So this was a total wtf moment. The guys sober up and apologize and it‚Äôs not MY fight so I write it off as just weirdness and alcohol. We go out again about a month later with different people but same general group. It happens AGAIN with two different guys. At this point I am really confused because I have NEVER seen this behaviour from anyone in this group before and it‚Äôs just bizarre. It‚Äôs not like these guys were incels or she was the only female they‚Äôd ever been around. And I‚Äôm half ass watching this as much as one does casually when out with friends and I can‚Äôt see anything weird she‚Äôs doing and to me she seems to be behaving completely normally. She‚Äôs a perfectly regular girl‚Äî attractive but not like some jaw dropping breath taking beauty queen or anything crazy. I can‚Äôt figure this out. Again the guys apologize and again no one beat me up so it‚Äôs for them to make up and not my business so I shrug it off. But I do find it bizarre. \n\nA couple weeks later, a different friend takes her out with a completely different group of friends from a totally different social group and the SAME THING happens AGAIN between two guys who were friends and never ever did that before in their lives. \n\nAt that point I didn‚Äôt know what it was about this lady but something was weird and so I just stopped hanging out with her. Interestingly all the guys said that was mean and I was blaming her and that wasn‚Äôt fair. I agreed, but pointed out I didn‚Äôt really care why‚Äî they showed they couldn‚Äôt behave around her for whatever reason. It happened three times‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt chancing it again. It was so strange ‚Äî they wanted me to bring her around so they could act like cavemen or something? Fuck that. \n\nUnfortunately this meant I couldn‚Äôt hang out with her in groups where men were around so this really cramped our friendship and we gradually drifted apart. I found out from others that this happened probably 3/4 times she went out with people. To this day no one knows why and after about six months she moved to Ontario and no one ever heard from her again. She swore it had never happened before to her, but I find it so weird this kept happening so regularly when she was around.

He showed up for the second date and clearly hadn't showered or brushed his teeth because he smelled really bad and his teeth just looked unbrushed. It really turned me off so after the date I told him I wasn't ready for a relationship and that I wanted to be single for a while since I was just starting college and wanted to have fun.\n\nHe ended up texting me repeatedly after that saying that I don't want to date him because he has long hair and because I wanted to sleep around and be a slut. He also complained that he had spent money on me on the first date and that I shouldn't have let him spend money on me if I didn't want to see him. He also wrote a really long hate/love poem about me making me out to be shallow and a slut and posted it on myspace for all to see as if we actually had any kind of real relationship.\n\nNow that I think of it, I noped out of another relationship early on because the guy showed up to my house smelling really bad. I still wonder if that guy sprayed some kind of pheromone cologne on because I was really into him before that and had never smelled that on him before.

He would call and scream at me because I wasn't waiting at his house when he got home from work to make him dinner.\n\nHe also had a trigger violent temper, and would fight other people in the bar I worked at.\n\nAround the three week mark he casually mentioned that if I ever cheated he would kill me and hide my body on his parents rural property. This is the point I internally went \"get fucked, we're fucking done\". Externally I did that dumb girl laugh to keep myself safe. At this point I know I would break it off as soon as I could safely.\n\nAround week four/five he found out my lease was ending in a few weeks, and was hinting we should move in together. I was applying for jobs interstate, he said \"if you move away it's over\". I didn't really say anything, just acted dumb to not provoke him. \n\nWeek six I broke it off by text, fuck no I wasn't going to see him in person. I had found a new place locally (moved a week later) until I moved interstate. He came into my work, started a screaming match, got thrown out by security. Came in again with a new girl, professing how much they were in love and going to move away together. \n\nI was so freaked out being at my house until I moved, he knew where I lived and had already shown he violent. He never hit me, but he would start fights with other guys with zero provocation.\n\nThe next guy I dated was wonderful, we've now been together eleven years and he's so kind and generous and thoughtful. \n\nThat expensive necklace I hated?

After multiple threats and intimidation tactics were used on my boyfriend (to no affect) we continued dating. \nI followed all my ex‚Äôs rules, even allowing him to track my phone at all times. He became increasingly insecure, and wanted me to end things with the new boyfriend after only a few months.

He lied about what they were investigating and I believed him. When they officially fired him it was over getting caught being inappropriate with a tech at work. He was dating a coworker at the time, so imagine everyone you work with knowing you have a wife at home, caught foolin with a tech, and a mutual coworker is yelling at home bc ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dating him‚Äù level of WTF?! \n\nI kicked him out a few days later once I had all the details.

            "text": "There was also the time I hooked up with a guy out of sheer boredom and depression.\n\nHe and I became friends because we had some mutual interests, and he suggested we become \"friends with benefits.\" Yes, I know. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I already knew it wasn't a good idea to get strings because I was so vulnerable at the time, but I guess I'm a glutton for punishment.  \n\nOur \"friendship\" felt genuine at times, he seemed to care when appropriate and showed interest in getting to know me and asking about my life.  I was semi-guarded with him, but I felt comfortable enough to hang out.  Our hangouts were often strange, in that he liked to take walks around to check out girls.  This behaviour, even prior to our hooking up, was very uncomfortable for me.  But then he was also downright predatory, he would say and do things I found disturbing, specifically towards women.  One of his quips was \"fifty no's, and a maybe is still a yes.\" Since we were both tradespeople, I naively believed this was just part of the industry (and it kind of was, for me, but that's another story.)\n\nWhen we finally agreed to be FWB, we had both put down some ground rules.  He said he didn't want me getting attached (which he wound up doing himself), and that he wasn't \"interested in dating,\" I said I wasn't interested in seeing him anymore if he wanted to sleep with someone else.  We both agreed and commenced.  \n\nFirst, he pressured me to have anal sex, which I really did not want to do.  I have dealt with trauma in my past and I made this very clear to him.  But did that matter to good old \"friend\"?  No, of course not.  What daddy wants, daddy gets.  Then, he started pressuring me to see him everyday, sometimes twice a day.  This also accompanied spending a lot more \"friend\" time together, so here I stupidly believed we were the best of buds.  Fuck I was stupid.  He would have me over under the guise of playing video games or watching a movie, but all he would do is try to have sex with me, we literally never did anything else alone together.\n\nThen, there was a girl he was interested in.  No problem, we aren't dating, enjoy yourself, I said.  He would hang out with her and detail to me (disgustingly) how she was, and I practically knew everything about her because he never stopped talking about her.  And before you say, \"you're jealous,\" no, I really wasn't, I just really didn't need to know what this girl's body parts smelled like.  He was becoming unbearable to spend time around, but luckily he took care of that himself.\n\nAbruptly, he decided to stop talking to me altogether.  He didn't call or text, didn't ask to hang out.  And in fact, he took it further, going as far as to act like I didn't exist at all when we were in the same room together.  While I wasn't necessarily interested in 99% of our talks being about this girl he was obsessed with, it doesn't mean I didn't want to still be friends, afterall, they call it \"friends with benefits\" because there's usually friendship.  Apparently he didn't feel the same.\n\nOnce I understood my place in his life, I left him alone.  I spent a lot of time during this period catching up on things and just living my best life.  But admittedly I was very lonely.  One day, I was having a coffee alone when he showed up, decidedly my \"friend\" again, asking why I never hang out anymore.  He completely lied about ignoring me, tried convincing me that it had been me who had stopped talking to him, none of which was true.  But I was no longer feeling particularly partial to him, and I was feeling a lot less attracted than I had just a month before.\n\nHe insisted on making it up to me, he wanted to hang out, so I agreed.  Big mistake because he just wanted sex and decided after that to fall asleep.  I wandered into his kitchen for some water and as I walked around, I began to really look at his place.  I wasn't digging through drawers or anything, but I was observing details I had ignored when I had been so infatuated with him.\n\nSome major things I noticed on that day was that he seemed to never have a sheet on his bed, his kitchen was filthy, and his entire house smelled strongly of dog feces and urine.  I was really grossed out all of a sudden and decided to leave.  On my way home, I thought honestly about how I really felt towards him, and some things that jumped out at me were how uncomfortable I often felt around him, how irritated I was by his misogynistic view of women, how bothered I was about the way he objectified me and even the girl he was obsessed with, and ultimately I couldn't come up with one thing I even really liked about him.  I reframed the idea of him in my mind, and I have never been back to his house since.\n\nHe has tried multiple times to get in touch with me, going as far as adding me on numerous messaging apps and even coming to my house.  He has harassed me about being \"friends\" even though we have literally never been friends (I see that now), and even once put his hands on me years after our last encounter.  The most recent time, I threatened to call the cops and have him arrested for stalking as I have made it infinitely clear I am not interested in being friends or hanging out.\n\nPerhaps not a story of \"noping\" out of a relationship, but more of being disenchanted.",

If they use the relationship as a bargaining chip in arguments. Say you are in disagreement on something and they go: \"I can't be with someone who thinks *that way*.\" They are effectively threatening with breaking up, without saying it directly and perhaps without even realizing it.\n\n2. If they are unwilling to carry their weight. If whomever you are with don't wanna pay, or are expecting you to pay without compensation. It's not that they have to pay the same, it's more about the gesture. I don't expect my girlfriend, who happens to make half as much as what I do, to pitch in the same amount. But I expect her to pitch in with what she can. If you take someone on a first date and they just expect you to thanklessly pay, I'd steer clear.\n\n3. Introducing problems regularly. I was with someone once who had this pattern. If I was down, she'd come pick me up with full force. But if things were good, she'd always find some way that things were bad. If I solved any issue, she'd find another. Some people are like that and it'd hard to notice, when you're in it.\n\n4. Unwillingness to negotiate. If your partner is doing something that is making you unhappy or causing the relationship damage, and you appeal to them a change in your relationship dynamic, they have to be willing to have that conversation.\n\n5. Eye rolling. If someone is eye rolling you a lot, they don't take you seriously.",

Got the call from my mother that they were headed to an emergency vet which was about a mile from my GF's.  I however didn't have my car and asked the GF to give me a ride. She wanted to wait until her show ended when the show just started 5 minutes prior. We argued for a moment before I just said see ya later and walked to the emergency vet. Took her two days before she messaged me and when I didn't respond she called me.  No asking how the dog was doing or anything. I told her to just get fucked and leave me alone. She still tried really hard to reason why she couldn't give me a ride and even had the balls to say that \"it was just a pet\". Fine, argue more on why you are a piece of shit and reinforce my decision to leave.  \n\n\nSecond, I was over my GF's staying the night.  I get up in the middle of the night and use the restroom. When I am climbing back in bed I hear her phone vibrate. I'm not one to usually snoop on someones phone and I had no reason to suspect anything. But my subconscious would not let me get back to sleep and I felt one little look to simply see who had texted or if it was some other notification wouldn't hurt so I could relax and get back to sleep. So I peek and see its a text from her ex, I had been with her for about 5 months at this point so it was odd he was texting, especially at 3am. Well, I could see the first part of the text without unlocking the phone and saw \"U up? Wanna fu\" and it cut the rest off. I'm not stupid and knew exactly what the rest of the word was and instantly I was fuming. I had to know how long it had been going on so I opened up her phone and saw their conversation was empty other than that msg. So now I'm thinking that he's just an idiot and try to go back to bed. I still can't get back to sleep as I'm thinking I missed something there. So back into the phone I go and get into the background where I can see the msg receipts that still show even when you delete a msg. I really  hated that I knew how to do that and I ended up seeing conversations, really just a line or two of each text because that is all the receipts show, between her and 4 other guys that were sexual in nature. Noped outta there and didn't talk to her for a few days. She got a ride down to my house by her brother, as her car was broken at this moment, and thought she was doing something cute by surprising me. Well I told her what I saw and told her to never to speak to me again and she denied it all and even tried to act as the victim because I went through her private phone. Well, yeah I shouldn't have but at the same time I saved myself from getting even more attached and finding out down the line.  Dodged a bullet there. A few months later I heard from a friend she was now pregnant and didn't know who the father was. Also found out she had to do paternity tests with three of the guys and did figure it out. She called me shortly after I found out she was pregnant bawling her eyes out wanting sympathy. I just told her to get sympathy from one of her many fuck buddys and to leave me alone and I hung up. Never heard from her again. A few years later and I ran into her brother and learned she now had 2 kids with different dads and another on the way from the current bf. He said she was devastated when we broke up and he thought she began sleeping around after we broke up to deal with the \"heartache\". He even said he was angry with me just ghosting her like I had and was tempted to confront me about it but apparently she stopped him from doing so. I had to correct him with what actually happened and he apologized and said he was disappointed in his sister.",

At first it seemed somewhat normal: he paid extra attention to me, helped connect me with other resources on the material. Then he became more forward as the years went on: asking me over to his house to swim, offering to drive me and my friends places. I never accepted because it felt weird and he never pushed. He went to college nearby so kept working at the camp and always requested to work with me. No other adults thought it was weird they all thought it was cute and teased me for having a crush (I don‚Äôt think I actually did at the time). \n\nFast forward to my junior year in high school (11th grade), all my friends start dating and stuff. I‚Äôm cute but fat and very focused on getting to my dream school so don‚Äôt have a ton of offers. Plus I‚Äôm a year younger than everyone else, which doesn‚Äôt help. One weekend I‚Äôm at a party with some friends and Forensics Guy (FG) is there. We get to talking and he tells me I‚Äôve grown up beautifully and he always knew I would. Basically fat girl kryptonite. He asks me to go somewhere quieter with him and I like the idea of being seen as desirable by a ‚Äúhot older‚Äù guy so I go. We are hanging out in a home office in a strangers house and he makes a move so I go with it. I liked kissing him, teenaged hormones and all, so we made out for a while. I get a text from my friends letting me know it‚Äôs time to go so I make my excuses and give him my number. \n\nHe asks me out and I say yes because ~hot boyfriend alert~ and plus I have no idea how this is supposed to go. We started ‚Äúdating‚Äù and for the most part it was all online and by text or phone because he was IN MEDICAL SCHOOL. We finally find time for an in person date and it goes really well. So we schedule another one. That one goes great too. So far things are looking good and I‚Äôm able to rationalize the age difference because I‚Äôve always been told I‚Äôm ~so mature~ that it just makes sense. My friends know he‚Äôs older but not how much so I just lie and say he‚Äôs only just in college and it‚Äôs fine by them I guess. \n\nFG and I set up our next date and it works out that it‚Äôs during a break in school for him, so we agree to do it on a long weekend so I can stay overnight. The weekend comes and I have a friend I trust drive me to his apartment and she is staying with family near by just in case (smart move). At first things are fine, we cook and talk and watch something dumb on TV. We eventually start fooling around and he‚Äôs taking it further and further, but it feels good so I‚Äôm going with it. Then he starts talking. \n\nInitially I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOh, this must be dirty talk. Let me listen and learn.‚Äù But as I listen I realize how‚Ä¶weird it is. Then it goes from weird to‚Ä¶inappropriate. He‚Äôs saying things like ‚ÄúI love how you still wear your hair in these little pigtail braids‚Äù or ‚ÄúI remember when I first met you how you‚Äôd bite your bottom lip when you were working and all I could think was how much I wanted to bite it.‚Äù That was super sketch, considering I was 9 when we met. But then, after unhooking my bra he said ‚ÄúMan, I remember before you had these. I wish we could have done this then.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I was like ‚ÄúGIRL HAS SVU TAUGHT YOU NOTHING??‚Äù I excused myself to the restroom and texted my friend ‚Äú911‚Äù. I head back out and try to slow things down, but he‚Äôs getting pretty insistent. Just when I am pretty sure I‚Äôm going to have to do more than I want to with this creeper, there‚Äôs a loud banging on the door and we jump apart. He gets the door and it‚Äôs my friend and her grown ass cousin coming to get me. He shouts at me to get my shit and get in the car while he talks to this guy. I comply and my friend and I are in the car listening to her cousin shout, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fucking 24 she‚Äôs barely 15 do the math‚Äù and my ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù talking about how ‚Äú15 is old enough‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known her since she was little‚Äù and the cousin is like ‚ÄúBRUH that doesn‚Äôt help your case leave her TF alone!‚Äù\n\nThat was not my finest moment, but I once I caught on to the crazy I noped the fuck out of there.

I said I was sorry, that I just wasn't interested in learning about them because I don't believe they are true or worth investing my time in. He just kept yelling at me that I was being unreasonable for not being open to them. I basically ignored him and went to bed. The conspiracy theory thing is already kind of a red flag for me, but his anger issues were an even bigger one. His need to control the conversation and then throwing the adult version of a tantrum when it didn't go his way was enough for me to nope right out of that relationship.

I already wanted to go home.\n\nAnd then we got there and I said \"this is me.\" Then they went, \"Oh I thought you were walking to (my) Station.\"\n\nI just said, \"Uh....okay, I'll walk there I guess.\"\n\nSo we were walking and there was a red light. They start waving their hand like a traffic enforcer would until there was green light. Harmless, but weird.\n\nThey also kept looking at me. Like bro, I'm not going to run even if I wanted to. \n\nThen they go for my hand and I'm like, \"oh....okay.\" Then they said, \"I did it! I held your hand!\"\n\nI was just there smiling awkwardly....like do I, I don't know, say \"yay, you did it!\"?\n\nAnyway, I let them hold my hand while we were walking and when we would stop at the light, they'd look at my hand, touch it like they've never seen a hand before and look at me. \n\nMy hair also covers almost half of my face. So they brushed some of it out of the way so that \"they could focus on looking at me.\"\n\nThey were looking for the station's entrance and wanted us to go around and I'm like \"there is one over there.\"\n\nSo I told them that it was nice meeting them. Then they said \"I would kiss you because you are so attractive\" and I went \"Yeah, no\".\n\nYeah, I'm not doing this nonsense again.",

First year was a dream, so great we moved in together halfway through our first year. Next year and a half slowly turned into a nightmare. He started drinking more, smoking more, getting jealous of my male friends, refusing to let me see my female friends, they had to come to our place. Hating my job so much he would only let me sleep about 2hrs before either a) waking me up for a screaming match before I had to go to work or b) having tons of people in our living room playing video games or movies or whatever at high volumes so that I couldn't fall asleep (and in either scenario he would eventually force intercourse on me as a way of \"making up\". I was young, stupid and in love and didn't know better). He tried to keep me from my family, especially my dad because he was jealous of him. Having teens over at parties while I was at work, getting drunk and then shooting arrows in to the ground while the teens were passed out. So many lies and stories: Telling me how he shot himself in the leg with an arrow to prevent same kid from calling cops on him. Another story of him getting shot (grazed) in the side by a rival gang (no), claimed he was honorably discharged from the Marines (there was zero evidence of that), tried to make me shoot a (pea shooter) gun in the home where we had several animals, I was very anti gun at the time and I didn't want to risk hitting anything. Told me he was going to teach me self defense and immediately put me in a choke hold while telling me to try and get out of it. Only stopped when I started gasping and crying. There were many many other instances that I should have gotten out, but the final straw was when I had come home from work with one of my friends to find one of our kitties with the skin on his neck slashed. He was sitting up and trying to clean himself and seemed overall fine, I freaked grabbed him in a towel and my friend drove us to the pet hospital. Get the kitty checked in and immediately call the boyfriend sobbing and telling him how I had found the cat and asked if he knew anything or how it could have possibly happened. His response \"ummm...don't let them call the cops.\" Wtf. So he gets home and I ask him to explain. He says \"well I may have accidentally cut him.\" Asked him to explain HOW. He said, \"the cat had gotten outside last night, and I knew you would be worried so I went looking for him and found him under a car in the alley. He was scared, I went to grab and as soon as I put my hand on him a dog barked and scared him more so he bit me. I tried to slap him away and I think that is how he got cut.\" What?? Asked him how he could have gotten cut? With what? He said \"well I always carry my k-blade with me\" Asked him why the hell it was in his hand while trying to get a cat out. He had no response. Later I learned he had told our roommate at the time to try and find the cat while I was at work so that when he got home from work he could \"finish the job\". Finally woke up and got my ass out of there.",

At a friend's Christmas party it was a running joke that my gift was cool aid and ever clear. The backstory behind this was at the previous party I came over with our house mom's drink aka Laura drink which is 2-1 everclear lemonade. Anyways, I was gifted a bottle of everclear and I know 5 or 6 shots over a 2 hour will get me sufficiently hammered till the next day. So I'm doing them and sipping on some other lesser alcohol and water between things. If you have drank everclear you got form sober to drunk to black out in a matter of minutes if you aren't careful. After drinking everclear for a bit as a challenge but also joke to some I've figured out my sweet spot. I usually fall asleep before I black out which is great. Anyways, I'm drinking this shit and my ex is drinking her shit. I'm hammered and so is she. We decide to go to her place and go to bed. She wakes me up, mind you I'm fall over drunk-cant stand or operate my limbs. She's throwing a huge jealousy fueled rage fit. I grab my shit and leave, after she threw my phone and dented the back metal casing so much so the a corner of the screen pops out. She also tried to ruin a friend's watch (thank God she realized it was his), some of my shot glasses and glassware she still from my room. So it's a half mile walk to my place and I have absolutely no memory of it. According to one of my best friends he saw me drum le through the front door and lay down in the foyer and start to sleep. I wake up the next morning with a oho e that has a giant dent in it, no watch (it was a friend's. We traded watches for the weekend), missing a shoe and some other stuff. A big ass bruise on my face and I was still drunk from the everclear. Now, I thought the bruise was from running into something but the dude at the mcdicks saw it and goes \"bro idk what you did last night but you have a fist on your face.\" I had the friend who drove me look at it and he confirmed the bruise had knuckle marks. After checking with friends at the party and they all confirmed that my ex was super jealous the whole night and I did not jokely tussle with anybody at the party, I broke up with her. I went and got my friends watch and left the other shit since I didn't know about it until after she broke it all. She sent me a photo of each item and then a video of them being broken. It was a real bitch act. She then stirs up all this drama between myself and another dude and as smart as it was we talked for 2 seconds about it and it was clear. So basically she tried to make my life hell by playing with my emotions and it worked until a friend talked some sense into me. \n\nAnyways, long story short, don't stick your dick in crazy.

Long read, but if anyone else is going through getting out of a toxic friendship (or relationship) maybe this will help.\n\nWe met because she was dating one of my best friends, we will call him Matt. I‚Äôm 34f, Matt is 37m at the moment, this is a few years back. Matt and I are the definition of plutonic ‚Äî as close to a brother as one can be without being blood or marriage related. Anyway, his girlfriend (we‚Äôll call her Liz) hated me. HATED me. Looking back, it was likely due to jealousy and insecurity but I was in my 20s and just as insecure as anyone else. I made it my goal to be as welcoming as possible ‚Äî she was with one of my best friends and I wanted him to be happy. She seemed to make him happy.\n\nWhelp, Liz did NOT make him happy. She eventually warmed up to me after I made it clear I had a serious boyfriend, but she was always very very wary of me. It sucked even then. It was exhausting. I‚Äôm an idiot. Anyway, she was the type of woman to scream at Matt in the middle of the sidewalk for looking at another woman who walked past them. Matt dumped her. She had no friends. So I took her in as a friend with the caveat that Matt is one of my besties and I won‚Äôt be in the middle of their relationship and that he and I would continue being friends.\n\nI am an idiot, idiot, idiot.\n\nThings were okay until they weren‚Äôt and she lost her mind on me when she found out that Matt had a new girlfriend and I was going to meet her (for the record, I have no idea HOW she found out, but whatever). She lost it on me. It was bad, abusive even. I thought ‚Äúfinally, friendship over.‚Äù Two days later, she came to me in person and apologized. It felt sincere. She said she was seeking counseling and I thought ‚Äúokay, she‚Äôs trying‚Äù and I forgave and pretty much forgot.\n\nI am a freaking idiot.\n\nA few months later, I was hit with the veritable parade of horribles all within a few months of each other. My mom almost died as a result of sepsis (take ALL antibiotics when prescribed, people). I‚Äôm talking getting last rites and everything. My brother lost his job and moved in with me. My nana (who I was VERY close to) passed away after battling cancer. AND the toilet in the second floor of my house separated from the wall (that‚Äôs a whole other story) one night while I was sleeping and the entirety of my bedroom and first floor of my home was destroyed.  My  brother and I lived in a hotel for a few nights while repairs went on.  As you may imagine, I was emotionally unavailable and wasn‚Äôt really being social.  A few weeks after the flooding incident, she got mad at me because I wasn‚Äôt available for her and didn‚Äôt seem interested in being friends.\n\nI was vulnerable. I was depressed. I was in the midst of breaking up with my ex boyfriend. I was an idiot idiot idiot. So I dove back into the friendship (despite my brother saying she‚Äôs nuts and manipulative).\n\nThe final ducking straw came a few months ago. I got a huge promotion at work just before the start of the pandemic. I also started up dating my now husband (and absolute LOVE of my life). She was awful. She hated my now husband. She was nasty, aggressive, and just rude to him. He‚Äôs an awkward nerdy man, but he tried so hard to be nice and kind. And it worked after MONTHS of effort. \n\nHe and I got engaged. I am the happiest I have ever been. I tried to keep her in the loop with wedding plans, but as the pandemic worsened as we got into the holidays, we had to cut back our plans like crazy. We got married with just family and my best friend and my husbands best friend. Best wedding I have ever been to. Happiest day of my damn life. He is my knight in slightly tarnished armor. I love him more than I thought I could ever love a human.\n\nThen, out of the blue and months later, I find out from another friend that Liz has some issue with me. She and I had hung out a few times since the wedding ‚Äî but with the pandemic raging in my area and my husband and I trying to get pregnant, we really were not doing much socializing other than virtual stuff and outdoor activities where possible. We were also MOVING my husband out of his house and selling it (for those of you who have done that, you KNOW how ducking hard and exhausting moving is). Anyway, I reached out and checked in with her and apologized for being generally unavailable.  \n\nI am an idiot, idiot, idiot.\n\nThis lead to a whole line of crazy accusations, that were said to me and to others, including: ‚Äúyou clearly don‚Äôt want to have any friends anymore now that you‚Äôre married‚Äù; ‚ÄúI talked to other married friends of mine to see if you‚Äôre being normal, and you‚Äôre not‚Äù; ‚Äúyour marriage isn‚Äôt healthy‚Äù; ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a really bad friend, but that‚Äôs okay because I have good friends‚Äù; ‚ÄúI am worried about seeing you out in public because you will just be pleasant and act like yourself‚Äù; ‚Äúyou were a better friend when you were with your ex [who she knew was verbally abusive and manipulative]‚Äù; and ‚ÄúI guess now he HAS to be a permanent part of your life.‚Äù \n\nThat was what finally did it. There was no going back in my mind. All of the shit she pulled over the years came flooding back. The shitty comments. The attacks at my personality. The comments to other people about me. When I was hurting she was no where to be found. When she was hurting I gave her a place to sleep, a home, love. \n\nAs you probably guessed (if you‚Äôve read this far), she tried to reach out a few days later and apologize and return to ‚Äúnormal.‚ÄùThanks to therapy and my own increased self esteem (shout out to the hubs), that‚Äôs when I finally said ‚Äúenough.‚Äù I did not say this to her, but all I could think was: You can come at ME all you want. I was raised by a narcissist. I dated a narcissist. I can put up with and even love a narcissist. But the second you go after my husband ‚Äî the definition of good, kind, loving, adoring man ‚Äî and our marriage, you can fuck right off. He is not my obligation, he is my happiness.\n\nI have never had a friendship ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù like this. Friendships fizzle out, of course, but that‚Äôs natural.  I‚Äôve never had this level of drama and hurt. It sucked. It still sucks ‚Äî even months later I still feel twangs of guilt because I never wanted anything more than for Liz to be happy and love and be loved in return. But I could not do it at the expense of my own happiness.  I think about her and (cheesy as it is) I pray for her happiness everyday. \n\nBut, I was an idiot, idiot, idiot for years.

The test came back negative obviously but I sat her down and explained I didn't think it was going to work and that a relationship was never agreed and her eagerness to have a child worried me and I wasn't ready for such big commitments at all never mind this early into knowing a person \n\nWell she flipped shit and made her way home and 3 months later she's actually pregnant with another guy in her town and now all she talks about is the start in her life her baby.

When I was expelled (and went into a pretty deep depression that I didn‚Äôt even recognize for years) she said she was happy because a long distance relationship would have been hard.\n\nShe practically prohibited me from having any female friends.\n\nShe tried to turn me against my family.\n\nShe sabotaged every attempt I made to go back to school.\n\nWhen my parents moved out of state and my sister and I got an apartment together to stay local, she just kinda moved in.  Never asked, she just did.\n\nBorderline accused me of cheating at least a few times a year.\n\nThe end of the relationship was a process that latest a few months.  She went on a trip to England with her ‚Äúplatonic‚Äù male friend, and I really didn‚Äôt care.  Then I decided to move to upstate NY (where my parents had moved to) to take advantage of SUNY‚Äôs Empire State College program (remote state college that took up to 3 years of transfer credit, intended specifically to allow working adults finish their degrees).  She moved back in with her parents in NJ.  \n\nAt some point she found out that I was still smoking, and she lost her mind, said that if I lied about that I must have lied about cheating and we were done (this is after she cancelled plans for us to see each other in person 3 times, once when I had left my sister‚Äôs college graduation in Philly early to see her and instead had to drive all the way back to upstate NY).  \n\nWithin weeks she had moved to North Carolina with her ‚Äúplatonic‚Äù friend, and despite her swearing that she had never cheated on me, I happened to see her FB post later that year celebrating their first anniversary...months before the first anniversary of our breakup.\n\nBut the story has a happy ending.  A couple months after that relationship ended I started dating a woman at work.  She is now my wife, our son is almost one, we just bought a house, and over the years we‚Äôve been together I not only finished my degree but went to law school (thanks mostly to her love and support and pushing me to follow my dreams).\n\nLooking back years later, I realized that I was deeply depressed after getting booted from school, and our relationship just put me in emotional stasis, unable to move on or grow.  We were together for something like 4 years, and for the second half of our relationship I didn‚Äôt really love her, I just didn‚Äôt care enough to do anything.",

When I say \"technically,\" I don't mean that we weren't officially dating, or that there were other people involved; it wasn't open or anything, we were dating in a normal enough way.\n\nHowever, throughout that three-year relationship, I saw her - that is, convinced her that we should hang out - roughly ten to twelve times. That probably sounds really bad even not knowing anything more, but it gets worse: she lived twenty minutes away from me, we both had cars, and we both had free time (as in, neither of us worked on the railroad or anything).\n\nWhen we did hang out, it was all about her. I asked her to see a movie maybe fifty different times, but we only ended up seeing two movies together - Star Wars Episode VIII, which I didn't want to see because I knew how bad VII was, and the My Hero Academia movie, which... I can't stress enough how much I really did not want to see that. One of our \"dates\" she brought her computer to my house and started recording a stream for her three followers on Twitch of her trying to get a shiny Pokemon to hatch, which didn't end until the 154th egg (and not because she succeeded, because even she was burned out by that point).\n\nThe worst of it was when she invited me to go to a convention with her. I thought it would be fun, but turns out that she basically only needed a ride: once we were there, she promptly ditched me for a group of her friends. So I just sat in the little cafeteria they had and waited for her to finish talking to them... But then they went off somewhere else. Me, being an awkward person and not into the content of the convention, I just waited there until I knew the one event she was really jonesing to go to was coming up. That was... I want to say five hours, which was especially boring because I'd already missed the FighterZ tournament and there were no other events I was interested in. But finally, the event she wanted to go to comes up, and she's there, and for a moment I'm glad to see her again... But then she hands me a camera and tells me to tape the event since she's participating in it. We didn't say anything on the ride home. I've never felt so bad in my entire life, before or since.\n\nI kept trying with her, but even getting her to send a message over Discord or something was like pulling teeth; we'd go months without her responding to any messages before she'd appear from nowhere to post some news about one of her interests before she vanished again. I came to realize that she was a borderline sociopath by the end of it, and it hurt me to do it, but I told her I wanted to break up with her. She seemed surprised, asking \"Are you sure? Well... Okay, I guess, if that's what you want...\"\n\nI got no closure whatsoever from that relationship and she started seeing another guy a few months later. That was my one and only relationship, and honestly, I'm beginning to think that one try may be enough.",

After a few dates it was clear she was ready to get down.  We didn't really have anywhere to go (she was staying with family and I had asshole roommates) so we went to a city park and had fun on the playground equipment.  Next day she didn't answer her phone, the day after she didn't show up for her shift.  Totally ghosted me.  My feelings were hurt and my self-confidence kinda took a hit, but I was genuinely worried about what happened to her.  Cut to 2 weeks later and she calls me to tell me that she had been in the hospital for the last two weeks.....in the psych ward.  She tried to kill herself that night after I had dropped her off.  Turns out she was staying with family because her parents were overseas somewhere and she had broken up with a guy she was dating there and tried to kill herself there too, so her parents sent her to her relatives to clear her head.  She said she was sorry she hadn't spoken to me, but it was important for her to be cut off from the outside world for the 2 weeks she was in hospital and that she really wanted to make things work.  I was terrified of triggering her again and was really sweating meeting up with her.  I spent an evening writing out why it wouldn't work out between us (best summed up as \"I'm 21, your 19, neither of us a emotionally mature enough to navigate a relationship like this\") and when I told her, she was surprisingly calm about it.  We enjoyed a coffee together, and we our separate ways.  I never heard from her or saw her again.  \n\n...That is until 2 or 3 years later when my younger brother was doing a study abroad in the same country her parents were in and he unknowingly ran into her there. He didn't put 2 and 2 together and he wound up sleeping with her too, but instead of a suicide attempt, he got stuck with her stalking him for the rest of the time he was in that country. \n\nTL;DR - Stuck my dick in crazy, predictably regretted it.

If anything ever went wrong even just a little bit she'd take it out on me by cutting me or slapping me. Whenever I expressed any negative emotion from my clinical fuckin depression she's yell at me saying \"just hide your emotions around me, it bums me out and it's fuckin annoying\" then she has the AUDACITY to yell at me for never opening up. THE CHERRY ON TOP IS THAT NO MATTER WHAT WHEN I TOLD HER NO I DONT WANT TO HAVE SEX (or do anything sexual cuz we were in school) and instead of listening to me she just did what she wanted. So she raped/molested me, abused me physically and mentally and she constantly flirted with people in front of me.",

She hung up. A while later, she sent me a message claiming to have OD'd and saying goodbye. I grabbed my friends and we rushed to her apartment. She didn't seem bad at all, just inebriated, but I was too worried to notice. We started nursing her to a decent state. A friend cooked chicken soup, I held her hair as she threw up. Another friend refused to call the ambulance and warned me that she was manipulating me and faking it, but I was again too worried to notice.\nAnyway, she didn't actually OD. She only drank a bottle of whiskey and smoked a joint to make herself seem inadequate and get mild signs of alcohol poisoning.

She, at the time, lived very near me and even her university was near my own.\n\nWe were talking via whatsapp at the moment (of course, I told her how I have been feeling and that I stayed home for the day), she told me she had a lot of homework to do so she was gonna go straight home to study. I was ok with that, wasn't gonna ask her to come see me if she had stuff to do, no problem.\n\nWhen she got home, she hit me with a weird message. She says \"I saw you walking through the street ‚úã\" with a fucking open palm emoji, like saying \"Oops, caught\".\n\nI was baffled, I said: \"Uhhh I've been dying in bed all day tho\", she insisted she had indeed seen me walking a few blocks away from where I live. Suddenly I began wondering if I had a doppelganger.\n\nI insisted that I've been in bed all day and that maybe she got confused. That's when she said something that instantly made me explode.\n\n\"I was walking from the other side of the street, I know it was you!\".\n\nOk so you're telling me you saw your boyfriend on the other side of the street, and you didn't even greet him?\n\nOf course I asked her that, and she answered.\n\n\"I thought you were going to a friends house üôÑ, so I didn't bother you\".\n\nI know I'm making a lot of emphasis on emojis, but she always used them to express herself, and those emojis were of course like \"Uhh excuse me? My women intuition is telling me you're uh totally wrong ‚úã\".\n\nSo I told her: \"You know, if you want you can come to my house to check for yourself. I've been here all day long, I'm still in my pyjamas and my mother can confirm I haven't gone out.\"\n\nShe answered: \"Nah, it's ok. I believe you ‚úã\".\n\nI snapped, said: \"Fuck you\" and blocked her. Haven't spoken with her since.",

(Looking back on it, it was not a smart decision, especially since most of them were probably puppy mills.) The both of us were big animal lovers and this was one of the few things that we had in common. Anyway, we went to a local pet shop and she found a pupper that she really wanted to buy. I didn't take her too seriously until she ran out to get her parents. I go with her and she finds her parents and brings them in and begs them to buy the puppy for her. Mind you, she had a dog, a Guinea pig, and a Cockatoo that they were trying to give away. Her mom, being the more responsible one out of her parents, said no. Her father was seemingly trying to convince her mom from what I remember. \nI remember what caught my attention even more was when she said that the puppy can replace her older dog when he passes.\nAt this time, we lost our previous dog that I grew with a couple of years ago and I was still grieving her even then.

Given that we were only seeing each other in person once a month or slightly less, I told her several times that if she ever needed ‚Äúmore‚Äù, that I was fine with it, provided we set some rules and boundaries, etc. She told me no, I was all that she needed, etc. \n\nOne summer we went on a trip away to a metropolis. We both had business in nearby areas and decided to make a vacation out of it. We both had our business trips first then met up in the city when we were done. The first night in bed, while I was cuddled up behind her, she swiped on her Home Screen past Tinder. I didn‚Äôt question it at the time, but obviously it rang some alarm bells. \n\nA mutual friend of ours in the city casually told me the next day (not while gf was around) that she had found my gf on Tinder, they had a laugh about it. When she found out that I hadn‚Äôt know my gf was on Tinder, she apologized and assumed I knew. \n\nObviously I was suspicious but tried to explain it away.

I confront my gf about it and she lies through her teeth, making all sorts of excuses that I can easily refute until she eventually tells me she made a mistake. \n\nI end it because of the lying and deceit, not because of Tinder. A month or so later, I find out she‚Äôs been on Tinder meeting people for well over 6 months. \n\nGlad to have ended that when I did.",

This reminded me of me a few years before, I used to tell the same kind of lies and I decided I would try and help her combat the habit as I successfully had. When I was 16, I thought I was everyone's therapist. Anyway, we were talking online for a couple of weeks, then I found out her lies went beyond just made up stories to validate herself Infront of others (the kind of lies I used to tell) through one of her friends that she had told everyone I was her bf (I know, what more could I expect from a habitual liar)(if it was that alone I wouldn't of minded) but she'd also told them that I'd been going to see her every weekend and we'd fuck all weekend for months. We hadn't even met face to face.This was also a problem because she was a couple of years younger than me, and underage. I was scared shitless of being arrested for fucking someone who was underage. When I confronted her about it, she threatened to kill herself.. not because she felt bad about what she had done, but so that I couldn't be mad at her... To change the subject, to emotionally manipulate me. It was then that I realised there's a difference between being a little bit mad, and completely messed up. I told her shed crossed a line and blocked her on everything. She changed her phone number, rang me and shook a packet of pills in the background threatening to OD. Me being the overly caring and easily manipulated person I was, I stayed on the phone with her for a while talking her out of it before putting the phone down and blocking the number. But she had an endless supply of new phone numbers apparently. At first shed call very regularly, and me being Me, I kept on giving her my time just incase she was being serious about killing herself. To her it became a game. This happened until I was 19, although eventually it got less frequent. And then stopped. If it stayed as frequently as it had began, I wouldve gone to the police. I probably should of.

It was a pretty big bathroom, and even though he was six feet away from me, the stink of his urine was so rank and overpowering that I started gagging and had to run from the room.

I was young and we met off of MSN chat.  She'd sent me pictures of herself that wasn't accurate and when we met I was pretty disappointed.  I wasn't really that nice to her after that.  She was over the moon for me though.  After we met, I felt absolutely terrible for treating her with indifference and not being very nice, so i started dating her trying to make up for it I guess.

My mom told me she posted that she had cancer and it was bad.  \n\nAfter a year of nothing else about the cancer, I figured she was doing it to get attention because she would do things like that.

            "text": "This was with a girl that had some issues. I mean that in the literal sense, she had dissociative personality disorder, an eating disorder and some serious self-confidence issues, all of which warranted therapy which she wasn't getting yet at the time we were getting to know each other.\n\nAnyway, we were getting along fairly well, two dates in, communicating via text and voice messages on WhatsApp a lot. A joke I made didn't land well for her and out of the blue she decided to break up whatever it was that we had going. That was the first of many occasions where her mood would suddenly shift, she would block me, and then a few days later unblock me and pretend nothing happened. That went on for a few weeks, maybe months, I don't quite remember.\n\nDuring all that she confessed to having the issues that she had, I didn't know about that up until then, and I tried to be understanding of that. The trend continued, though, with verbal and emotional abuse being the norm for her other personality while the other one didn't feel like acknowledging that she had anything to do with that, because \"she wasn't the one giving me a hard time, that was her other self.\" I didn't know, and still don't know, whether or not it's a good thing she disassociated from that other personality in the way she did, but putting the emotional burden solely on me was very taxing, especially that early into a relationship.\n\nEventually we came to a breaking point where she asked me if we could forget everything that had happened up until then and if we could try again, provided I wouldn't break up with her so long as she was in therapy (which she was going to start very soon). I told her that it wouldn't be easy to just sweep everything under the rug, but most of all that I couldn't promise her that our relationship would last throughout her therapy, only that I wouldn't break up with her because of it. (In hindsight even that was a promise I probably shouldn't have made, but I truly wanted to be supportive of her.)\n\nTo her, that was unacceptable. She was angry that I didn't give her a chance because of her issues, that I wasn't putting in any effort to accommodate her circumstances, and more of the same. That was my straight up \"nope\" moment. I had gone through a lot to keep in touch with her, I did my very best to accept the fact that she had no control over her other personality, I was looking up articles about what it was like to date someone with her issues and reading into how to deal with all that. But she never acknowledged any of that, in her eyes I straight up rejected her because of those issues.\n\nI definitely didn't handle the entire situation as well as I could or should have, but at that point it was clear to me that this wasn't going to work. The beginning of any relationship shouldn't have any of this kind of turmoil, I definitely missed some red flags there, but I looked past them because I felt her issues were out of her control. But not recognising the effect that she has on the people around her and straight up dismissing the mere idea that she is not the only one that is affected by her issues was just a deal-breaker for me. Regardless of the level of control she has over her assertions, and regardless of the fact that she likely struggles a lot more than those around her, I just couldn't do that.",

I longed for a bit of time to myself.\n\nOne Saturday, I realized that I couldn't remember the last time I had read a book! I told BF I was going to read for the afternoon. He was going to replant plants on our balcony into larger pots. Great, I thought. A solo activity for him.  \n\nHa.

And when he wasn't asking for help he was talking to me from the balcony. \n\nI kept saying that I was trying to read. He would say, yeah right sorry. Then interrupt me again a few mins later.\n\nFinally I said: I told you that I want to read, but you keep interrupting me. I don't remember the last time I read a book. Please let me read.\n\nHim: But, I have dirt all over me and I didn't want to run back and forth making a mess.\n\nMe: Gather what you need. And please stop talking to me.\n\nHim: I'm doing something nice for us to enjoy and you don't even want to keep me company while I'm doing it or help out at all. I'm doing it. I just asked for a little help from you.\n\nMe: I appreciate what you're doing, but I said I'm trying to read. How would you manage to repot plants if I WERE NOT HERE? Pretend I'm NOT HERE. \n\nWell that did it. He was all hurt and wounded and wanted to talk about our relationship. Oh boy... \n\nHe came in, got cleaned up, and sat right in front of me (sitting on the trunk we used for a coffee table). He closed my book, took my hands, and said very earnestly: we need to talk. I need more intimacy. I don't mean sex, I mean connection.\n\nMy brain exploded into thoughts like, WHAT!? Are you f**king kidding me right now. You want MORE intimacy?! MORE connection?! Holy crap we are SO WRONG for each other. We are totally mismatched. Geeeeez I can't even read without hurting his feelings!\n\nI hopped up and said: No. We have TOO MUCH connection. We're interacting so much all the time that I can't read a damned book. Get out of my face, shut up for 5 seconds while I tell you I'm out. You will be a great partner for SOMEONE ELSE who doesn't need to ever be alone with their thoughts or do any solo activities. I'm going to my parents' house to read this book and will come back tomorrow with friends and a u-haul to get my stuff. You can have the apartment Bye.\n\nAnd I left. Rented a storage place and a u-haul, and asked him to give me the next afternoon to move out. He was there of course, talking to me the entire time I packed up. I stayed at my parents for a couple of weeks, rented another apt, and never looked back.\n\nTLDR: I moved out when needy, chatty BF would not shut up long enough to let me read one page in a book.",

She told me she had some mental issues but was on medication for it and I was used to dealing with people who struggled in that way (I do myself sometimes) so I was cool with it and told her to just keep up on her mess.\n\nShe did not.\n\nAfter a couple months she took herself off her medication things went sideways fast. She became depressive to the point that where she just wouldn't get out of bed, which I get is a thing, but it's a little different when someone ELSE won't get out of YOUR bed, even after you've been at work all day and they just stayed at your place, never leaving or even showering. But again, I thought it's just a bad phase that she's going through and she'll pull through soon enough (I didn't know she stopped taking her meds yet).\n\nThen she started getting SUPER clingy. To the point I had to set limits on how often we would see each other during the week. I even set it at 4 nights, 2 at her place, 2 at mine, and 3 days off for us to have time alone. Then she started becoming... idk how else to describe it other than \"sexually dependant\". We could never just hang out and not have sex. Don't get me wrong, as a dude it sounds amazing, but when you're actually going through it, it's really not. Like sometimes I just would just want to go to sleep, and she would lay there literally begging me for sex, and after I said no, would stay up talking to herself until I eventually caved at like 3 in the morning.\n\nAfter that I told her I needed a break to figure some things out. A few weeks later I had her come over so we could talk. We had a long conversation. I told her that we could try to make things work, but she had to get back on her medication, and I set some boundaries going forward, culminating with the last part which was \"if I say no to sex, that means no, and you shouldn't keep me up all night until you get your way\".\n\nThen she said the last thing she should have ever said. After a nearly half hour long conversation (mostly one sided) where I laid out all of my concerns, explained what I needed out of the relationship going forward, and explained how I wouldn't tolerate certain behavior going forward, she immediately followed all of that up by saying \"So can we have sex now?\" I was... stunned. I could only respond by saying \"Are you fucking kidding me?\". That was the last straw. I again said no, then told her I was done and asked her to leave.",

Well, while he was out visiting me on a family trip, he threw a punch at me while in anger. Not angry at me, just upset at himself but lashing out. His father begged me to forgive him but I noped right out. His sister later called me and told me she just found out he had cheated on me with 10-15 other girls so she was glad I called things off with him.\n\n2) Met a guy in college that hit it off well with me but I wasn't looking for anything serious at the time, especially since he lived an hour away and he was only here working a contract job in my area for 4-6mos. I told him that it would be hard to continue seeing each other after but he assured me that he would still make the drive. Fast forward to the job being over and he hasn't found a new job yet, I have been driving down to him instead, and he's now running out of money...so he's getting really stressed. He finally snaps one day and gets verbally abusive to me so I walked. He kept in contact occasionally and we saw each other about a year later at a conference, where he showed he was still interested by bullying me over 3 days. No thanks, not into middle school minded bully flirting.\n\n3) The last guy I also met in college, shortly after my mother's death. We had gone to the same schools since elementary, lived in the same town (even in the same neighborhood for a few years), but never ran in the same circles. We decided to hang out, I didn't realize he thought we were dating until 2mos later when he forbid me from certain hobbies because I shouldn't be around other men. Excuse me?! Then he revealed his obsessive tendencies by telling me all about his paranoid conspiracy over his sister's suicide 5 years prior. He also wrote me a 2 page poem about my breasts. Nope! He's married now so obviously someone wants that level of crazy!\n\nBonus Story: guy that flirted with me for a couple weeks called me one day and asked what I was up to, just hanging with my best friend (whom he could hear in the background). He then proceeds to ask \"if I was a bear...what would I *do* to you?\" Uh...what? You'd probably maul me? \"*Oh yeah I would...mm...\" Rip out my interval organs...leave my carcass for the vultures... \"But *what would I* **do** *to you*?\" Yeah...haven't really spoken to him since.",

She sees nothing wrong.\n\n2. We woke up one morning and in bed, she told me she got pregnant on purpose by skipping her pill for a week. I got up, called the landlord, an elderly man, and I told him both stories. He let us out of our lease right then and there, said I was getting a bum deal and he did not want to make it worse.\n\n3. While separated with ideas we would reconcile, she started sleeping with an old friend of hers. I found out because one night I was staying with her and he came over. It took her an hour to ask him to leave. When she returned upstairs I asked her to bring me home at which point she assaulted me. I never laid a hand on her because if the cops arrived and saw even one mark on her (Texas) I was going to jail. We went to counseling soon after that. On the 3rd visit my ex had enough, she hated it. She said to me \"I'm sick of going there every week so you can both tell me I'm wrong!\" She refused to see that sleeping with her old friend was anything but normal and I was wrong to try and break them up.\n\nThe week prior the counselor said she would have to stop seeing her old friend permanently for our relationship to work, it was my only demand at the time. She said they had been friends since childhood and it was unfair of me to demand that. The counselor just said, \"Well, that's your decision and he (me) is going to do what he has to.\"\n\nMy EX was CRAZY! Not in that way most people say it, but like in \"She's the most disgusting person I have ever had the displeasure of knowing.\"\n\nEDIT: She raised our son (27 now) to think I had abandoned them because I was a weak man. He moved in with me at 15 and we had a great relationship until he broke his collar bone last year and had to stay with his mom for 2 weeks. He hadn't talked to her in over 5 years. After he left her place, we are no longer friends. I don't know what she told him, but she suddenly made him hate me so much that he blind-side assaulted me with a coffee mug to the head last time I saw him. Never mind when he called me without insurance I paid for all his surgery out of pocket and was always there for him when he needed me. Now I don't know where he is, his little sister misses him (2nd marriage) and it's all my Ex's fault.\n\nSince me, she has been married 4-5 times and has 6 children from 5 fathers.

He was a bit of a druggy at uni, but otherwise great, he experimented, but that was ‚Äònormal‚Äô for the arts crowd at that time. And I adored his family and our mutual friends. But let‚Äôs just say the drug abuse at uni left a legacy long after he ‚Äòstopped‚Äô...  one of the drugs he would take was acid, then he‚Äôd go on a bender all night and then in the morning drinking his own morning wee (gross) - to get a second acid hit and ‚Äòstop the come down‚Äô. It was a hippy tactic that was rancid (literally) and left a life long legacy. \n\nLong after this behaviour stopped, He would occasionally get secondary trips, completely randomly, and start gurning, staring and generally not making sense. I‚Äôve learned acid can do this to you. It meant he was unable to concentrate much, and destroyed his mind, ambition and career potential. So sad. The times he wasn‚Äôt spaced out I will treasure. My moment of clarity and walking away happened at a restaurant, just the two of us, when he started having yet another secondary trip. And then drank drank drank, which just compounded the train wreck. It was a nightmare and so awkward. Despite my affection for this person, the familiarity, the lovely family and long friendship I was done. I walked away that night and have never contacted him again. Left a strange mix of feeling like I dodged a bullet and grief. Sad.",

She voluntarily signed up to go to a clinic for a month to help since she had been sexually assaulted by a coworker a few months before we met. That wasn‚Äôt what had me nope out. I was proud she was doing it and was supportive. Well that changed when two week later she left and asked me to come over. I came over and we hung out for an hour then she convinced me to go to a dance class with her. Sure why not try something new? We let her parents know and left in her car with mine left at her place. After an hour of the dance class we stopped at a Chili‚Äôs for food. About 10 minutes in she says we should slow down and work on our friendship. No problem at all. Not a deal breaker. The dealbreaker came a minute after when she gets a call from her mom asking where she is. She explained that we were out getting food after class and her mom blew up on her. Starting to accuse her of being black out drunk, that she should never have trusted her with me and was coming to pick her up with her dad. The girl hung up on her mom and started having a mental breakdown and saying loudly at the bar how he parents made her wanted to kill herself and that we should runaway because she can‚Äôt go back home with her parents. I said let‚Äôs calm down, I will go to the bathroom real quick and explained to the bartender I would be back to pay our bill and we would leave. I get back from the bathroom and she had run out to her car and was about to runaway. The bartender had to tell me where she went so I could check on her. I told her we can‚Äôt runaway because that would get the police involved real quick. I went in to pay the bill. When I was paying the bill her parents arrived. He mom forced her into the girl‚Äôs car and drove her home while I caught a glimpse of her dad turn around in a parking spot and leave. Yup they left me stranded 30min away from home, with my car at their house, work the next day and the parents being possibly hostile to me if I showed up to pick up my car alone. I had to call my dad to come pick me up as I did not want to go get my car alone and it was late at night. Luckily I got my car without incident and a couple days later just texted the girl to see if she was alright and then say that we shouldn‚Äôt really be in each other‚Äôs lives at all. Hope she got out of that terrible family situation and got some help but I am not even going to touch anything involving her and her family with a 10ft stick.",

She had been raped by her ex boyfriend and his friends back when she was in high school.\n4. She was raped by an unknown taxi driver.

She got pregnant because she was constantly sexually abused by this stranger. \n\nI found out that all except the 1st point she ever told me was a lie.  She got really jealous if I gave anyone except her, any kind of attention. My brother met with an accident and she decided to fake a rape attempt the very same day. She send out her own nudes to specific mutual friends and later told the culprit had snatched her phone and stripped her clothes off and send it to her contacts. Typing this makes me feel so fucking stupid, but in my state of mind I would believe anything she said. She's been doing the same things to many guys who's she had previous relationships with. I did a lot of background checks on her through common friends, and turns out she was double dating during the first two months of our relationship.\n\nI confronted her and spoke to her parents about all the lies she's been telling me and our friends.

When she is about 10 feet from me she throws herself into a car and starts screaming that I hit her....I'm standing there absolutely dumbfounded. \n\nA guy approaches me and starts shoving me telling me to leave her alone.  I didn't take kindly to it and said 2-3 times the next time he touches me I'm going to hit him...\n\n I hit him, really hard.  He's knocked out, falls, hits his face and gets a little bloody.\n\nSomeone calls the cops and half the people are trying to get me out of there.  I refuse to leave because \"I didn't start shit\".  Cops show up and some random strangers told him, accurately, that I only hit him when provoked.  The other guy refuses to press charges (he fucking knew better).  So I'm off, free to go...WRONG.  \n\nCop feels like I wasted his time so unless I got a ride home I'm going to jail.  I walk into the reception with the cop, looking for a ride.  I see a group of friends while the cop is explaining to the groom's mom what happened.  I get punched...I look up, it's one of my good friends.  Remember the guy I punched outside?  That's his girlfriend's Dad, who is also apparently got some kind of back disability.  So now I'm the asshole and he's going to kick my ass for it.\n\n After a little scuffle I walk back to the cop and say man.. just take me to jail... He's handcuffs me and we start walking outside when the groom's mom stops us and says \"fuck that, I'm taking him home.\"  She puts me in the car drives my drunken ass home telling me how bad she can't stand the guy I punched (she grew up with him) and not to worry about anything.  She gives me a cigarette and heads back to the reception.  Thanks Connie!\n\nI pass out in my recliner...ahhh... sleep. Nope, phone is blowing up. GF's Mom calling telling me I need to stay away from her daughter.  \"That's fine gf's Mom, I don't want anything to do with that slut anyways\" Click...\n\n Now ex girlfriend and her new lover call. \"Did you call me a slut to my Mom?\"\n\n\"Yep\"\n\nNew lover: \"I think you know who I am, I know where you live, I'm gonna come beat your ass.\"\n\n\"If you honestly think right now if you came here and have anything to lose if you did beat my ass you're in for a surprise.  Bring it on over mother fucker\"\n\nI think that calmness and general lack of anger in my voice scared him a little bit.  They never did come.  \n\nI walked to a buddy's house the next morning to catch a ride to my truck, when we get there I have 4 flats and its been keyed down both sides.  I hop back in buddy's truck to head home (can't do anything with my P.O.S. atm) I look at him and just say...\"What a night\"",

I on the other hand are one of the few friends he has that doesn't do any types of drugs and he respected that which made me feel comfortable around him while he was smoking. One day I went to a college party (location: frat house) and him and his friends were all in the basement of the house just smoking an vibing. As I said hello to my friend, he looked at me and thought that it was a good time that I can smoke weed for the first time. I told him \"Im not interested in smoking anything\", yet he kept on pushing me for like 5 minutes. I break. \"Okay I'll smoke 1 blunt\". Worst decision of my life.\n\nI remember smoking with him and his friends and we're all having a great time.\n\nUntil I started to feel like I was coming out of my own body and yet I was still in real time. I fell to the ground and I couldn't move. Turns out the blunt my \"friend\" gave me was laced with K. K-Hole. I faintly remember all of them laughing and calling me mean names. I didn't do anything to them. They're all just assholes.\n\nMy friend and his other friend carried me out to a bathroom in the basement of the house, threw me into the bathtub with my face facing the celling. They turned on the cold shower and the shower head was pointed directly to my face so the cold water was hitting my face all at once. Mind you I still couldn't move.\n\nI was left there for hours. I couldn't move, barley breath because of the shower head only hitting my face, I was tripping like seeing shapes move and shit. This was equivalent to being buried alive. They did this to me because they thought it was \"funny\" to them.\n\nAnyway, hours passed by and I was able to move again. I moved slowly out of my position and crawled up the basement stairs. The party was over. Cups everywhere, bottles everywhere, I even saw 1 guy passed out on the ground. I pulled out my phone to call one of my buddies to pick me up but the water from the shower destroyed my phone.\n\nI was left with nothing and I had class the next day. Luckily, I was able to stand on my 2 feet after pushing myself for minutes. I ubered myself home and thank God that I was alive. I ghosted my \"friend\" that drugged me ever since. I heard he got in trouble with the authorities about 4 months ago. Im not sure what he got in trouble for but I don't give a fuck.\n\nEver since then I never smoked pot ever again.\n\nThis was 2 years ago. Sophomore year in college.",

What I didn't realise is that she meant only for her, this was not stated. I slept with a girl, and she told everyone we knew I cheated on her, including her parents and I was living with them at the time. Surprisingly I didn't leave her immediately (I kinda was desperate to keep the roof over my head, gave her credit for simply not knowing how she'd react to the situation, forgave her and called off the open relationship) 2 months later she came home at 9am after having gone radio silent at about 1am giving the reason that she crashed at female friend's house.

I tell him again that I'm sick and won't be going anywhere but he can come watch a movie if he wants.

I only knew him in-person for the span of a few weeks (we talked online for years). Got jealous and possessive when I hung out with other girls (called me a lesbian), and guy friends too. Keep in mind that we were not even in a romantic relationship, I had not known him in-person for that long, and he knew that I had no interest in dating him. \n\nThe breaking point was when he said some extremely sexist and disgusting things about women and I was just in shock. I didn't speak to him for a while and he was pissed. It really affected me idk why but I guess it just seemed like a huge betrayal. He really showed his true colors. Anyway, I stupidly forgave him (although he never really gave an apology about the things he said) but I think it was just to make myself feel better tbh; I don't like getting into arguments with ppl. I stayed friends with him for almost a year after that (online long distance) and I just felt weird about it, and maybe guilty? It felt like I was betraying myself and my morals because I was still talking to him despite all the things he had said. And I wasn't being wholly truthful because I obviously never fully forgave him. He gave me a couple more red flag statements regarding women and other shady stuff that he was doing, nothing too explicit but still something to make you scratch your heard and think 'why am I still talking to this guy'? Fast forward when we could meet, he brought a bunch of his new friends and I thought it would be cool to meet some new people. He told me he was really excited to see me in person after a long while apart... \n\nFor several hours he did not make any eye contact with me, nor did he try to initiate any conversation with me at all, he just talked to his friends about things they had experienced together. It was the absolute worst because obviously it's a long distance \"friendship\" and we aren't able to see each other that often. I honestly should have noped outta that situation way earlier but I wanted to be polite to him and his friends by staying (silly teenage me). At one point his friends left us alone a bit, and I tried to initiate some innocent conversation (asked about his plans for the summer), but he quickly shot that down with a negative response. I also caught him in a few lies he was telling his friends (things contradictory to what he had told me in the past) but I decided not to call him out because I didn't wanna be an asshole. Anyway, I was so, so happy when I finally could leave! It took me a while to realize that he was toxic but I got there. I left out a lotta details but you get the gist.

We had a ton in common and it was honestly one of the best first dates I'd been on up till then. It also ended with an amazing kiss.\n\nSo he was from a town not too far away from where I was living. Maybe an hour away by train? So we both went home and we're talking and making plans for me to visit him the following week.\n\nIn that time we talked about many things, including but not limited to sex. Especially as I was supposed to stay the night and we wanted everything to be on the table. Open communication you know? Well I also offhandedly mentioned a sex toy(magic wand) that I had always wanted to try but never had the chance. \n\nSo over the next week we're chatting and he mentions a couple of times that \"if everything goes the way he wants it to we would be a couple by the end of the weekend\" and that he wants us to be \"exclusive\". I told him both times to hold up, slow down, we've only been on one date.\n\nWell as the week goes on he gets worse about it and I get progressively less interested. And about halfway through the week I get a screen shot from him of a purchase he made from an online sex toy retailer. He says he's super excited, meanwhile I'm getting a little weirdest out and getting less excited. I'd told him to slow down a number of times at that point. \n\nFriday rolls around and I end up messaging him and telling him I was no longer interested, that he's trying to move too fast for me. So he said \"no no, just come up and have a chill evening, nothing has to happen.\" So I reluctantly agree, we talk for a bit more and he ends the conversation with \"but I still expect exclusivity\". So I sat on the conversation overnight and couldn't sleep because I was feeling anxious.\n\nSo the next morning I messaged him and told him I was no longer interested in visiting, that I felt he was moving too fast and I couldn't provide him with what he was looking for, but I wished him luck. \nWell that absolutely set him off. He absolutely freaked out at me said \"now I'm sitting here on my bed crying\" and \"I had no idea that's how you felt, why didn't you say anything, I wish you had been honest\". He then sent me a picture of the toy. So I called him out, told him I had been honest and that I didn't appreciate being guilted or that he sent me that picture to \"show me what I was missing\" regardless of if he meant it thy way or not.\n\nHe continued messaging me for the next few days until I blocked him. Then would message me every couple of months after finding a way to continue messaging me. Eventually I told him after a year \"I don't know why you're still messaging me, we went on one date a year ago.\" He freaked out and said \"I don't know why you're holding a grudge, I'm just here trying to be nice and you're being so rude.\" He had just told me about how he'd had a dream about me.\n\nHuge bullet dodged.",

            "text": "There were many moments when I could have left but I kept thinking it would be different along the way. But it was on Christmas that I noped when staying with her family in a trip in a land I did not understand nor felt comfortable with that made me just reach a limit of patience. And I just packed my stuff and went back to take a bus to the airport, it was a rural area but I handled, the problem is that she followed me in another bus so I had to sit at the station for hours to wait for her and it was way too late. We spent the night at the bus station surrounded by so many people looking strange and creepy. The bathrooms were not free, equivalent of 50 cents to go in, which is not bad except it can make going constantly to piss a problem. When everything finally opened I then got a cab to the airport and I had to buy both our tickets back home. I then after arriving ordered a cab, went back to her place and I unpacked her stuff so she could be well in her parents' house. I was far too gone emotionally. It was a very rocky relationship the last year of it, but that time it all culminated. I could have just gone to the airport myself and gone home and have enough to survive until I had to take my plane back to my original home. But I was left broke, I always spent for her because she refused to get a \"regular\" job and waited to be accepted into what she studied, not realizing I passed a big opportunity once just so I could keep being close to her, I left two jobs because of her and even though I was not doing that bad, on the long run it affected my savings. I had a very bad credit because of my spending on her because all the time I had to provide, on top of sending her money from now and then. \n\nI think I left on the perfect moment, It will sound very sadistic of me but I know she was very afraid of the dark and a few days after I made it clear I was done and wanted to leave it as just an acquaintance relationship, she called me because her electricity was out at her house, crying and sobbing. And A big part of me was wanting to really go and help or invite her to my place to stay, but I realized I was just emotionally burnt out, I felt nothing. So I told her I would text her old best friend that lived close by. I never found out how she handled that situation. But I knew I needed to keep moving on. I later found out her mother retired from her nurse job. Which left the girl to actually start a \"regular\" job to provide. She worked in the airport at her city for some years until the pandemic happened. Her dad refuses to work and since I've known the family he is just a houseband. The little brother was always eager in trying to work so he could always help the family. Honesty I always felt like he was the best in the family, he was always eager to learn more, to practice and to get better. \n\nShe currently has a new relationship and I am at ease to know she has found someone, but when her posts involve sometimes the typical argumentized texts that are subliminal messages of her being angry at her partner or hinting at cheating and I recognized it was the same pattern when we were together. She at some point thought I was having an affair with one of my closest friends, mind you my friend is Lesbian, and at that point she was getting married. She is happily married and living a stable life away from her dysfunctional family with a great and quirky wife. The other thing I found out about the girl is that in the years after I broke up with her she ended up going after men that were married. It made me feel estranged finding that out. Today I know she has not changed a lot of her bad habits but at least she is currently happy. I just hope she can realize her flaws and change over time for the better.",

I already missed so much school at that point it didn't matter to me anymore to leave early. Well she got very mad when I would leave early and eventually gave me the silent treatment. I asked my other friend if this was normal and she got pissed that she said anything to me at all because 1, were aren't close, barely knew each other in fact. And 2, if I wanted to leave then that's my business. I didn't try to mend things after the silent treatment, I just let that one go. This girl also got very angry anytime any of us girls got a boyfriend. Needless to say I graduated just like everyone else so it wasn't the end of the world when I kept skipping school.",

There was one incident though... check this shit out...\r  \n\r  \nThis girl wasn't romantic and didn't want to talk about sex or have it etc. One night though, she came to my dorm, got naked, and layed on my bed. I was shocked for a minute but then got naked and joined her. I kissed her, talked to her, touched her and went down on her etc which received no reaction. (In my experience, that's a bit odd.) She also didn't touch me, try to give me a bj, crawl on top of me, start playing with herself, none of that. I ended up getting on top of her and right before I was about to enter her, I asked \"So you did get on birth control right?\" (We had discussed that maybe a month or two ago and she said she would.) She says no she didn't. What the hell? I mean if I hadn't stopped to ask...and why didn't she tel me before I was 1 second away from being inside her? So I stopped right there and got off of her. She said she didn't have condoms and if I didn't have any, then she was leaving. I actually didn't have any but that afternoon, we were right in front of the drugstore in town! If she had an idea that this was going to be going down, perhaps she should have mentioned that! Anyways, she just got up, got dressed, and started to leave. I said next time I'll have condoms but since this is both our faults, would you help me out? (I mean I would have gone down on her again if she had wanted me to but she didn't seem to want that at all.) She just said no, why would I help you out with anything like that? I was left to finish myself off and wonder about what the hell that was all about. That was the only time anything like that ever happened with her.\r  \n\r  \nI left her after a few months because something was really wrong with her and she was rarely a good/nice/sweet person. Not to be an ass or anything but she didn't deserve me. I wasn't full to bursting with self confidence so it took a little while for that to sink in for me.\r  \n\r  \nThe kicker is that once I left her, I found an amazing girl I totally clicked with and it was great! It was great until my ex started pretty much stalking me and lying to people about me;including the new girl. It got really bad and she broke up with me which almost killed me. I didn't get over that girl for years.\r  \n\r  \nThe thing is, once the crazy ex managed to destroy my relationship that I was really happy in, she didn't even make a move to try and get me back! (Not that I would have done that anyways.) I wish I had never met that crazy bitch.",

She had a drinking problem and would drink pretty much every night after coming home from work. On her birthday, we went over to her parents‚Äô place to celebrate. She got a bunch of gifts from her parents and her brother, and we had a pretty good time with them. On the ride home, we were talking about her parents being significantly old and their relationship and the foreseeable future of their relationship. My girlfriend started to get upset thinking about her mom losing her memory and her needing to take care of her mom because her dad was super self centered and wouldn‚Äôt be the one to do it, especially when he could no longer care for himself either. She got super mad at me on the ride home telling her it would be ok, and it wasn‚Äôt her problem right now to worry about. She wouldn‚Äôt talk to me after I said something I can‚Äôt even remember now. She drove straight to Walmart, bought two big bottles of vodka, wouldn‚Äôt talk to me the whole way back to her place, and when we got back she poured herself a tall drink. She headed out to her patio as I was still trying to calm her down/comfort her when she slammed the back door closed in my face. I stoped in my tracks and decided enough was enough(it wasn‚Äôt the first time she took her problems out on me and resorted to drinking, which inevitably led to her being verbally, emotionally, or physically abusive). I just grabbed my shit, got in my car, and drove home. She freaked out and apologized and tried to get me back, but the next day; I told her I was done. I was sick of being treated like a punching bag when all I did was try to support her, and I was not happy anymore in our relationship. She kept trying to manipulate me to getting back with her so I blocked her number and what not. A week later a box of my shit was left at my front door, and we haven‚Äôt spoken since. It‚Äôs been 4 years. I think about this a lot, and almost want to reach out to her.

And we do love each other, we just *can't* talk.\n\nAnyway after this nurture/nihilism treatment and then seeking therapy to find out the extent of the damage the DV did to me, it transpired that the only reason I'd shrugged it off because the first relationship had seen such horror visited upon me it seemed amateurish. \n\nSince then in 2015 I've ran into two people displayed massive red flags of having been turned into sociopathic abusers, and got the hell out of there.

Met an amazing girl, turned sour, got left in a foreign country with nothing, she got a train ran on her, maxed out my credit, sued me for damages and won, I am still paying for it 5 years later and will be for another 5. *edit* And theres still more bs i didn't even mention. *end of edit* edit2* moved tldr to top*\n\nOctober 2015- I've been working for the last 6 years saving almost everything and just got my new Job, I'd finally hit 6 digits income and felt like everything was going right for someone that had been homeless before while growing up as a kid, always on welfare, family full of hardcore drug addicts and incredibly abusive. Needless to say I left asap when I was 14. Worked a lot...eventually made it into what I called my dream job after putting myself through university, with my GED well behind me I was flourishing and budding as a young man. And that's when it happened.\n\n\nMet this (in my eyes) absolutely lovely, truly stunningly beautiful girl, we hit it off pretty well too, everything about it was rosy. Beautiful person, couldn't believe I found someone that was such a good match for me too, what I thought was a once in a lifetime chance meeting. I can't describe even how great she was at first. It felt too good to be true. and it was. Everything was awesome until she didn't get what she wanted. \n\nAbout 5 months in the big night came, which by the way was amazing. However, there was this one time i had to cancel our plans due to unforeseen circumstances (my alternator died in my car, the coils were literally glowing orange when I opened the hood. Soon after this, started one hell of an emotional manipulative roller coaster. I started working 60hrs a week to support myself and her, she left her job because she hated it and I was there to support her during the transition, rent, college payments, food, bills, transportation, you name it, I paid for it monetarily or through my labor for two people  living separate lives. \n\n:::Meanwhile, unbeknownst to me, this girl also at this time started to run up all my credit cards, steal my logins and information everywhere. I didn't notice because I have those on auto pay while keeping low to $0 balances. Always left about ~200 on them open for me to use because I never went over that. (Final Grand total of ~$70,000). I also used to make 8 hour trips after long weeks to see her at this point in time until she moved closer for college. :::\n\nWe broke up a few times after that problem surfaced but was very apologetic and understanding, so I forgave her, and she forgave me. We got back together yada...especially with upcoming trip getting closer. I've heard too many horror stories of tourists having issues to want her to go alone, so I didnt cancel my ticket. But hindsight is 20/20 right? We had planned the vacation before the above started happening afterall, so it would be a fun last hurrah, or maybe things would calm down finally.\n\nDay 1 was fine. Actually really fun. Hopes raised.\n\nDay 2: took all my possessions, left me stranded in a foreign country, different language(which I did not speak) with no phone, no money, just the clothes on my back. No keys to the airbnb, no access to anything. If I hadn't kept $100 in my shoe for what I call \"you never know\" emergencies I would have been SoL. \n\nDay 3: Borrowed a nice fellow tourists phone for a few moments to contact airbnb host.\n\nDay 4: Got into the airbnb and found this girl with 8 different dudes. Yes, turned out thomas the train was running on schedule that day. She was furious I got in and found her. Told her I was leaving. Started kicking, punching, biting, trying to stab me with kitchen knives, spray lysol in my eyes, etc. Most of those dudes noped out right there. One of them grabbed some of my things and put them in the stairwell. Got out of that finally, Grabbed what I could and left. (Thanks random guy that was banging my girlfriend! At least one of them had a shred of decency right? Also this is when I found out my credit was fucked, couldn't put a ticket home on any of my cards.) \nAt this point I of course noped the fuck out completely but I didn't end just because I noped out. It actually got worse.\n\nDay 5: Used my GPS on my reclaimed phone to track me down an hour away from the airbnb in the neighboring city and continued to assault me in public. When this countries police came I was arrested for assaulting her, naturally she was not arrested nor assaulted. \n\nDay 6-12 were uneventful mostly in the local police station where they held onto some people until it was decided what they'd do. Reviewed local restaurant cctv footage and decided I was good to release and apologized for holding me so long. (I stayed voluntarily, anything was better than that person at this point). \n\nDay 13: flew home, 17hrs total. \n\nDay 14: arrived home, changed my locks, locked windows. \n\nDay 15: went to work as usual.\n\nDay 16: went to work. Came home with this girl in my apartment. Nightmare ensues. Because I wanted to break up at this point, she tried to commit suicide in front of me(not with a gun but a knife and loads of pills. I of course dialed 911 while trying to restrain her from harming herself. I should have not cared at this point but love makes you do strange things. She went to the local psychiatric hospital (which was about $900/night and not covered by the insurance I had been paying for, for her, she was there 2 weeks. Ouch.) \n\nEnd of the month last day: She got out of psychiatric hospital,  checked herself out after telling her therapy person \"everything\", therapy person sided strongly with her and gave strong affirmations and the like, so she felt vindicated and justified in her actions. Swore nothing bad had even happened, anything I said was baseless, of zero value, and I was just \"wrong\" at every single thing. \n\nDay 1 of next month: when reproached for using my credit cards til they were maxed, She was dead certain that my credit was spent on \"my hoes\", in the same sentence declared she never hit me, tried any of the above mentioned acts, in fact what she declared was that I was the cause of everything that happened. I caused her to attempt suicide, I made her get a train run on her, I ruined her dream vacation, I ruined her grades in school (I did a good bit of her homework and essays/reports and lab write ups because she said please I don't have time, by the way all high marks, but because I was involved it was my fault) she just skipped class, failed all her tests and was overall rude to her professors to the point they ejected her from two of her courses. I ruined her relationship with her family, I ruined her relationship with her friends, I got her thrown out of her apartment (when i stopped paying for her rent and bills). If you can think of it, it was my fault. \n\nFlash forward a few months, then about a year later we are at court trying to settle disputes.  I get flat out denied by the (i like to hope and think its a coincidence but who knows) lady judge, any of my requests, reparations, requests for her pay me back even a small amount, request for a restraining order etc. I'm on the hook for all of it. Grand total about $130k of financkal damage. She sued me for emotional damage etc, settled at $650k. Lost all my investments from the last 6 years,  belongings etc. As well as my job, she wrote in to the HR department and made me out to be the worst kind of person. Publicly accused me of being a rapist and pedophile as well and subsequently lost my job. (Investments that today would have made me a millionaire. TSLA*~250k at current dec. 2016 rate*,  SONY*50k*, MSFT *25k  dec 2016*, some biotech, and my main focus, on cryptocurrencies, had about 250k in which I started accumulating in 2012. Missed the bitcoin rush, ETH and others.) As a result, in 2021 I am still paying for this relationship at about $800/month due to the credit consolidation. And it will take years for my credit score to get back to upper 780-800 range to where I can finally buy a house with some land. Maybe one day, eh reddit?",

Lied about losing custody of the first kid who is only 4 hours away and she said she couldn't find work down in San Antonio that's why she wasn't near her kid I just thought that was more horseshit.

I tell him, you know what, this is too much after a single date, no hard feelings but I'm out. \n\nTwo days later he invites me to the movies (I confirm he does indeed remember the Sunday conversation), I gently say no thanks. He starts to harass me about not giving him a chance. I remind him we went on literally one date and I'm not interested anymore. The texts and calls and aggressive standing behind me at the bar continue for another few months (the bartenders did tell him to back off and threw him out finally). \n\nI guess could've stopped going to the bar, but fuck him.",

They would break up, he'd come crawling back begging her to be together again cause she's the only thing that makes him happy, they'd get together, they'd break up again because they were miserable together, etc. When he thought he was gonna lose her for good, he tried to knock her up so he would have to be around her for the kid. When they had broken up, he hooked up with another woman and got her knocked up. When my friend tried to do a few month black out to sort her head, he didn't want to so she didn't. There was so much bat shit going on that we're like, \"Friend, fucking leave him. You two are literally not good for each other. You're trying to move on, but he doesn't let you. If you don't actually cut off all contact with him, he's gonna always be playing with your head like this.\" Her response, \"I know, but the more you guys tell me not to, the more I want to.\"\n         \nThat was my last straw.

But definitely have been on a few unlucky dates. \n\nMy first date in Highschool kept on saying that he wanted to take my first kiss (he didn‚Äôt) and kept making moves on me. I got really uncomfortable and later texted him that I didn‚Äôt feel fully comfortable to which he basically replied ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell anyone‚Äù which caused me to not want to talk to him anymore. \n\nThe second person I‚Äôve ever dated was in my freshman year of college. There was multiple red flags. We met off of a dating app and I was extremely nervous. The plan was to meet in my dorms lobby (we lived in the same dorm building) at this time and then we would go to Starbucks before walking around to get to know each other. 1st red flag was that he showed up over 30 minutes late. I was so nervous and embarrassed that I stayed in the lobby on the verge of tears texting my roommate (who told me to ditch him at that point. 2nd red flag is that he decided to scare me while I was texting my roommate (we‚Äôve never met in person before). 3rd was that he agreed to go to Starbucks but then told me at the Starbucks that he‚Äôs allergic to coffee. I asked him why he didn‚Äôt tell me and his response ‚Äúpeople just don‚Äôt understand it‚Äù (like how hard is to understand? You‚Äôre allergic to coffee end of story). 4th He kept boasting about how smart he was to the point that it felt belittling. 5th he kept asking me ‚Äúto guess his race and ethnicity‚Äù dude was super weird. Again when I texted him that I wanted us to be friends he replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm deeply upset. I‚Äôve spent so much of my time and effort into a product to receive nothing out of it‚Äù. I‚Äôve only been on these 2 dates and both were with weirdos",

I had no issues with her wanting to spend time with her friend on a holiday. On Thanksgiving I helped my sister prep then around 1200 drove to her friend's. She was completely wasted when I got there. Then more guests arrived. She never once introduced me to anyone as her boyfriend. She got really flirty with one of the guys right in front of me. Touching his arm, putting her arm arm him and talking way too close for anyone's comfort. I pulled the guy aside and politely let him know I was her boyfriend to which he apologized and said he never got one indication from her about it. I pulled her aside and told her what she is doing is not ok and she needed to stop. I reminded her that my sister is cooking us dinner as well and to stop drinking because I was not going to take a sloppy drunk girlfriend to a family dinner. The time came for us to leave and she refused to go with me. At this point I'm done trying to reason with her, so I leave. I come back after dinner and she is sitting right next to the same guy as before oblivious to the fact that I'm even in the same room as her. All her friends are just dead silent looking at me waiting for me to lose my cool. I just turned around, went home and shut my phone off so I didn't get any drunk calls.\n\nShe ended up getting in a fight with her best friend and walking back home because she was too drunk to drive. I had about 15 voice-mails of her crying for me to come pick her up. The next day I did go see her but only to tell her to her face I was done.",

I lived on campus and she lived nearby in an apartment with her sister.\n\nHer sister was moving out because she was graduating. My girlfriend asked me to move in with her. I said I wasn't ready for that kind of commitment. I had plans to go back home for the summer (only 90 mins away, not like we were doing the long distance thing..we still would have seen each other a lot). Also we both only had one year of school left and I said I was happy to revisit the idea after graduation.\n\nShe completely changed. She started drinking heavily almost every day, which was something she never did. She was rude and passive aggressive and started to get hurtful and mean. Then one night at a party we were playing cards with some friends and she punched me in the side of the head totally out of the blue. Everyone around us went silent. I asked her why she did that and she answered \"I felt like it.\"\n\nWe spent the night in my room on campus and the next day I told her we were done. It was a long fight with a lot of crying and she begged me not to dump her. She said my decision not to move in with her really upset her and she wasn't dealing with it well. After a lot of talking I agreed to not dump her, but I told her I needed some space and didn't want to see her for a little while (we spent almost all our free time together up until this point). She agreed.\n\nThat night she showed up at my room completely trashed. Like falling over drunk. No idea how she got there. I took her in and she was climbing all over me trying to kiss me and take my pants off. I told her no, got her to my bed, and tucked her in. Thinking she was out cold, I got a glass of water for her and put it beside the bed. I turned to leave my room and the glass shattered on the wall in front of me. It just missed my head. She said something about me being a loser and passed out. \n\nI spent the night in a friend's room and when I got back in the morning she was angry. She accused me of cheating on her (I didn't, I played video games with a friend then slept on his floor), then broke down crying after throwing up and started all over with the apologies.\n\nI sent her home and told her never to contact me again. She tried a few times but I ignored her. I don't know why she changed so drastically and wish I knew. I really loved her and saw a future with her.",

I apparently locked him in my house once, which is hilarious considering he had keys to my house attached to his own keys. Idk why but I stayed with him. \nSexual activity plummeted then because of the trust issues I clearly had after the cheating. So what did he do? He would get me drunk so it was easier for me to say yes. I never thought it was wrong at the time either, figured it was normal. I was made to feel awful because I wasn‚Äôt seeing to his needs. I owed him sex, I was being a bitch if I said no. I was pressured constantly to have sex with him. He told me once that, when he comes to see me and we get to my room, I should basically automatically be rearing to go and taking my pants off. I should be thanking him for coming to me by giving him sex, or at least giving him head. That‚Äôs how NORMAL women are. \nHonestly, the thing that eventually made me nope out of the relationship was at the start of lockdown. He downright refused to come and see me when it started lifting and you could go on a walk with people from other households. He‚Äôd refuse to meet me...but he met up several times with one of his friends ex-girlfriends. \n\nI snapped out of any hold this dude had on me then and I dumped all of his shit in front of his brothers house.",

The final straw that broke the relationships back was when I came back from a camping trip with my friends.

Luckily one of the friends that had been out with her the night before filled me in on why she was being a bitch. She had tried to cheat on me the evening prior while at a nightclub, but had gotten rejected by at least two guys. The sheer audacity of her manipulating me into making her feel better about being rejected by two separate men that she wanted to cheat on me with was just too mind-boggling and I lost it and dumped her in front of everyone. I later learned that after I had broken up with her and left, all of our shared friends basically told her that they were done with her bullshit attitude as well and wanted her out of all of our lives. She got broken up with and lost most of her friends in one evening.",

I was so scared to leave her, i thought i would be alone forever. But it was that realisation and her constant lies and manipulation that made me jump.\nSo i stuck a pin in a map, found a flat and moved 3 weeks later over an 2 hours away! Moved into my new home, gradually found myself again! Then met the most incredible woman i have ever met! 2 years later we have a child, a house, i have a better job with a fantastic work/life balance and im happy again! All my old friends have been back in touch! Im me again!\nSadly upon ending the previous relationship i found that my ex had taken out loans and credit cards in my name online and worked up a massive debt that i now have to pay off over the next 10 years, blacklisting me from a mortgage until 2029.

We're both super swept up in how much we're into each other before even physically meeting.\nSo we plan to meet, she says I can come to her place (she lived with her parents, but more on this later). I've met girls at their parents house before so no biggie. I greet her at the door with flowers and right away she plants a kiss on me, I'm thinking how awesome it is to be so in with someone so quickly. \nShe takes me into the house and introduces me to her parents, they greet me very warmly like it's not glaringly obvious I'm there to sleep with their daughter (that should have been a red flag but whatever). \nWe go upstairs and once we're in her room she gifts me with presents as it was coming up to my birthday (I know this was meant to be a sweet gesture but considering this was our first time meeting it struck me as a little odd, maybe I'm alone on this), fast forward to us making out like crazy, shirts off, hands going places etc. \nThere's a knock on the door. It's her dad asking if I wanted to stay for the weekend, girl thinks this is a wonderful idea. I'm hesitant at first but she whispers in my ear what we'll be doing during my stay so my \"second brain\" takes over and enthusiastically agrees.\n\nI shall bullet point the events of my stay:\n\n- She pretty much plays tonsil hockey with me on a high street every 5 minutes on the way to her local pub, telling me how happy I make her and how happy she was that we were finally together\n- We go to her friends birthday party that evening where her now ex-friend \"Sakura\" (who I became friends with later on) asks me if I'm her boyfriend, she shoots me the biggest puppy dog pressure eyes I have ever seen so I collapse under my social anxiety and say I am\n- On multiple occasions she starts making out AGGRESSIVELY with Sakura while her boyfriend \"Blake\" and I have no choice but to watch\n- During the night out, a guy who she knows and was having a conversation with takes her outside and kisses her. She immediately calls me and tells me, I tell her its not her fault and we get on with the evening\n- Back at her place, I start asking her about this guy and what his deal was. She doesn't want to answer and performs various acts to stop me asking questions. She then takes her phone, leaves the room and doesn't come back until I fall asleep.\n- The next day she LEAVES ME WITH HER DAD AND LITTLE BROTHERS WHILE SHE GOES TO A PARTY WITH HER MOM. \n- That evening we have sex in the living room while eating pizza, not even seconds after her dad leaves the room. When I ask if he's coming back her response is \"I don't care\"\n- The day I leave she is crying while I'm waiting at the station, I'm feeling like a goddamn sociopath for not feeling nearly as strongly, but I reassure her I'll see her again.\n\nNow, I didn't know what \"love bombing\" was at this point, but it was happening in spades that weekend, you'd honestly think I had drugged her with some kind of Harry Potter love potion. This kind of thing I'd understand if you'd known the person for years, but to be like that with someone from Tinder is a BIG red flag.\n\nFlash forward to our next meeting, its my hope that she's calmed down a bit. I am wrong. After some fun at my place, during pillow talk she's telling me how much she can't wait to spend the rest of her life with me and how she's told all her extended family about me. I decide it's time to rip the band aid off before this girl decides my skin would make a lovely coat.\n\nShe's devastated but eventually accepts and soon after we cease all contact.\n\nFLASH FORWARD A YEAR AND A HALF LATER.\n\nI am happy in a relationship, in a great place with my career and have moved in with my gifriend. Sakura drops me a message asking if it seemed like Karina was really intense while we were seeing each other, I say yes.\nTURNS OUT:\n\n- She had been sleeping with Sakura's boyfriend Blake the entire time I was in the picture, before during and after\n- It emerged that he was the guy she went off to talk to the night she was kissed\n- Blake dumped Sakura for Karina, convincing everyone Sakura was a cheater/abuser (turns out the whole friend group knew Blake was cheating on her and were all secretly hoping he would get with Karina)\n- Karina also tried to get Sakura to stalk my gilfriend because Karina blocked her because and I quote \"she couldn't stand to see you with someone hotter and more successful\"\n\nI don't even want to imagine what Karina would have turned into if I stuck around. \nI'm just glad I didn't stay to find out.",

Things were fine, I'm into the rough stuff she likes in the bedroom, but it just kept escalating. Like Everytime we hooked up at her place she had something different for us to use and I got the distinct impression that they weren't new; like she'd had them a while.\n\nThe final straw was when she was on top, paused for a second, reached into her drawer, pulled out a knife (like an outdoors utility knife), and says \"Cut me.\"\n\nVery flat, demanding. You could hear the period in the sentence. She didn't stop riding so I just said \"What?\" I knew she wasn't joking but hoped *so bad* that she was. Like, even if she wasn't, if she'd taken the knife away and said she was kidding I'd have been okay. But nooooooo.\n\nShe repeated herself and proceeded to guide my hand (guide makes it sound gentle, she made me do it) to gently break her skin on her waist with the blade. Again, if that's where it'd have stopped, I'd have just talked to her about it, but instead she kept telling me to cut her harder and deeper.\n\nI didn't do it. I got her off of me, got dressed, went for the door. I verified several times as I was getting dressed that \"You wanted me to cut you, not scratch you?\" And she confirmed. She said something like \"Take some time to get used to the idea and I'll call you tomorrow.\" And I just said not to bother.\n\nFor greater context there were other reasons I didn't want to see her anymore, but none relevant to this.",

The one time I tried to initiate sex, he was totally oblivious until I spelled it out and we did not, in fact, end up having sex because reasons that I don't particularly *judge* him for... But he had self esteem issues that I wasn't prepared for.\n\nI ended it after he drunk texted me how beautiful I am, how amazing it was that I played video games and liked anime, then he told me how much he loved me.\n\nI was like, No.  You don't love *me*, you barely know me.    I told you I wasn't looking for something serious.  You neglect you dog, it's torn up my patio.

That I wouldn't be forever alone. That people were still interested and it wasn't the end of my love life.\n\nWell, I pretty much spilled the beans about all of my issues on the first date. That I was technically still married. That I had recently been to the psych ward for suicidal ideation and that my husband broke up with me a week after I got out of the hospital. That my husband was still living with me while seeing his new girl. That I was on anti-depression/anxiety meds to help me deal with everything. I was an overall downer of a person at that point in my life.\n\nDespite all that crazy, he somehow saw behind it all and continued to see me after that first date. I couldn't be more appreciative of his understanding though. Two and a half years later we are still together and couldn't be happier! I never knew how amazing a relationship could be when the person you love cares for you just as much as you do them. \n\nBut yeah... I have no idea why he stuck with me after the many red flags I put up on that first date and I'll always be glad he gave me a chance.\n\nThat being said, I'm sure I'm a rare case where those red flags were just indicative of the current situation and not at all a representation of my true self. If you ever do decided to give someone putting up red flags a chance, make sure they communicate and make sure their issues are something they are actively working on. I made sure my guys knew that my issues had nothing to do with him. I made sure he knew that while he's my support in emotional times, that it was not his responsibility to \"fix me\". All I ever asked from him during those times was to be held, to let me know he's there and maybe let me vent a little. Beyond that, it's something I need to work through internally with professional help. I also make sure to give as much as I take. As soon as the relationship starts to feel one-sided, get out. It's not healthy or fair to have someone put everything on you. It doesn't matter how nice of a person you are, it can and will wear on you. The biggest red flag in those cases is if the other person refuses to seek professional help. You are supposed to be a partner, not a full-time therapist.",

            "text": "I was living with my ex up until a few months ago. We met during a pretty confusing and painful time in my life not long after I'd moved to Berlin in earl 2019. She seemed very sweet and very helpful when we met, kind, generous, caring, empathetic... In early 2020 I had to go back to Australia (I'm from Oz) for family reasons, and got stuck there for 9 months due to C. We did long distance, and though I was dealing with a lot of family issues at the time, we seemed to be doing well.\n\nI got back to Berlin last November (2020), and the city has been heavily locked down ever since. This lockdown was really hard on our relationship as my ex had lost her job, couldn't be fucked with her uni, had lost her grandma to C... you know, she was having a hard time.\n\nThe year's end rolled around, and we were having some small drinks with some friends over NYE. My ex was nervous to be there, which I thought was strange as she's met my friends a lot, and my friends are very warm and welcoming people.\n\nMy ex ended up getting way too drunk and vomiting around 11pm, so just before midnight struck, we got out of there. I was tired and happy to be gone, and of course I had to take care of her. We got back to her place, and she started having a panic attack as soon as we walked in the door. I've supported friends through things like this before, but this was something different. She was erratic, sobbing, speaking gibberish... it was really unsettling, and went on for a couple of hours. I tried to play it down to the difficulty of the year, but it just felt so off.\n\nFor the following week she was like a completely different person. She gave me cold nothing answers when I asked how she was doing, kind of like an angry child. She looked at me as though I was evil, with so much hate and accusation in her eyes. She started making spiteful little jokes about the fact that I was working too much (I do music work and have worked really fucking hard to get to where I am, shouldn't she be happy that I'm keeping my shit together throughout the pandemic?). She started blaming me for little things, like when her pants would fall from where they were hanging, or saying that I was saying things to be mean to her on purpose (all with this newfound venom in her face and voice that I'd never seen or heard before...). She started picking fights, and accusing me of things like cheating (I've never cheated before and never could, I'm far too loyal). This went on for a couple of weeks and scared the shit out of me (unfortunately I've got a history of a few different forms of abuse in my childhood as well as adult life). I was so fucking confused. Who was she? Who was this new person who seemed so off? I've been trying to figure it all out ever since this started in January of this year, and to be honest, it feels like a nightmare, which is similar to someone I used to live with and be friends with, who gaslit me a lot, and who I now know is a rapist/child molester - she, with the way she was acting towards me, reminded me of him.\n\nAs I began to confront her about what was happening, she told me that she had been acting really cold and distant to me to see what I would do. This really sent my head spinning. Who was she then? Was she the person I fell in love with?\n\nAll of a sudden other little things started to freak me out, such as when she said that she would hold onto my stuff and care for it while I was in Australia so that I would come back to her, or the joking ways she used to accuse me of cheating early in our relationship. I thought all of these things were just jokes.\n\nI don't know what really sealed the deal for me, but the fear I felt in seeing how paranoid and willing to be sinister she was scared me, as I couldn't fall back into the insanity of an abuser who tried to gaslight me.\n\nI broke it off, and moved out in a really dramatic fashion, as I still don't know many people in Berlin, and it's really hard to find a room here. Then, after the breakup, I tried to confront her and ask her why she had been so awful to me, and why she would accuse me of cheating on her? As I said this, she looked horrified, as if I had accused her of some unfathomable crime, and played innocent. How could she ever say that? Would she really say that to me? Was I just making it up? She stuck to this hard.\n\nI then felt the insanity of being gaslit that I've felt a lot over the past 10 years due to this other person I was living with, and it scared the fuck out of me. As she said this, I felt fucking terrified, and I put my phone on voice record so as to have some form of protection if she really tried to fuck with my head, and then I got out of there. I still feel bad for her. I think she is in love with her own self-pity. It's helpful for me to write about this, as it's taken me a long time to really see with almost complete clarity that she was beginning to gaslight me in earnest, even though I still kind of doubt this :/ ... And I still feel bad for her, like I did something wrong.\n\nThank fuck I got out. The moment that I made the decision to leave, committed to it, and then walked out into the living room and told her that I was doing it was one of the scariest moments of my life - like something from a horror movie, but real, cos the fear is in your skin, not a screen. Almost as scary was the sheer look of terror in her face, a sick, deranged look of fear and insanity, which was masked in a split second of course - that switch was also so terrifying. I feel gross writing about it, I've played it down in my head in the 4 months since I left, it's still quite confusing. I don't know exactly what made me nope out, but I'm really fucking proud that I had the strength and self-respect to get out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: apologies for the essay, I haven't really been able to tell anyone about this in such detail, thanks reddit",

Ask her for a cute pic of herself so I can use it for contact photo, simply dosent respond.

I was ridiculously depressed and didn't want to have sex with him, he joke about me not putting to anyone who would listen.\n\nOne night I had actually gotten home from work with some semblance of energy so I got into a game his BFF had been ecstatic for me to start playing. I was really into it when he got home and i asked if he wanted to do anything or if its okay that I keep playing. He says whatever so I go about my business. Maybe an hour later he starts putting his shoes on and gets up to leave, i ask where he's going and he shrugs it off and leaves. Then i get a slew of text messages about how he's so angry with me that he wants to \"beat me to a bloody pulp and drag my body down the street by my hair\" so he cant be around me rn. Its 2 something am and he finally comes back, his phone has been stolen (he was sitting outside a 7 eleven in a really bad part of town and a few guys had driven around the block several times, jumped out and held a gun to his head and grabbed his phone. He fought them and ended up getting shot but it was only a pop gun)  he had me to pull up find my phone on my computer and then has me come with him to go search for the people who did it.\n\nI had already tried to break up with him before that and it took me another 2 years to finally get him gone. Finally i ended up kicking him out of my apartment and having him picked up by the police after I rescued him from a suicide attempt and he tried to choke me for telling him to stop banging his head on the wall at 1 am as we have neighbors and its rude. Once he was officially off my lease and out it still took another few months to get rid of him. He admitted to that he'd stalk me and stand outside my window to see if i was with anyone.\n\nAfter our breakup the only way for him to actually have let me leave was if i committed to couples therapy but i also required him to pay for it if it was something he wanted. We had a few sessions the whole time me saying how I didn't want to fix us that I just wanted him to let me go. Finally the therapist got on my side and told him it was pointless and he was wasting his time and money.",

She was a die hard christian and told me she was ‚Äúsaving herself for marriage.‚Äù I thought that was strange since she had told me before that she had sex with a lot of different people in college. She was rain man smart and had a big personality so the intense religious thing felt like something I could move past as long as she didn‚Äôt try to convert me. Anyway, she was head over heels for me, and I really liked her when we first started dating. So the first red flag was when I wouldn‚Äôt text her 24/7. She would send walls of text all day long, total stream of consciousness. I didn‚Äôt have time being busy with my work, and I told her as much. She came over to my place and pitched a fit. Screaming, throwing shit, the whole works. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your girlfriend, I‚Äôm entitled to your time.‚Äù I told her I grew up in an abusive household and that I wouldn‚Äôt tolerate that, and if it happened again the relationship would be over. Should‚Äôve ended it there but I wanted to give her a chance to show she can learn from mistakes, we all deserve that. A week later, we had sex. She initiated everything, we both had fun, I even had to get stern with her because she wanted to keep fucking into the night, it was extremely late, I had work in the morning, and she wouldn‚Äôt accept my ‚Äúno‚Äù. The next day, we wake up and she starts talking about marriage, kids, and moving in together. We had only been dating a couple weeks. I told her that I really liked her but that we should slow things down, and she cried and locked herself in the bathroom and called me an asshole. I had to leave for work so she let herself out. After that, I got really busy with work then went on a long trip to a farm where I had no internet, so I was only able to text her intermittently. She got upset about that again, but the next time I went over to her place, everything seemed fine. She went into the bathroom and came out topless and came onto me. I told her no, that we had things to talk about. This is probably the third or fourth time I told her no to sexual activity. She goes back in the bathroom, comes out dressed, and starts sobbing. I go to hug her, and she starts rubbing my dick over my pants. I tell her no again, and she loses it. Starts ripping shit off the walls and smashing it on the ground, screaming, swipes all the glassware off the table breaking it, starts rolling on the floor in the broken glass, and grabs a piece of it, points it at me, and starts accusing me of raping her and just plain psychologically abusing me any way she can. I put my hands up, inched sideways out the door totally terrified that she was going to stab me, slipped out and avoided ever seeing her in person again. Came to learn later that she did that to a lot of different guys, just a ton of batshit crazy manipulative tactics to get people to pay more attention to her and always trying to get straight to kids and marriage. The police showed up after I left that night she smashed everything and she sent them away, and then she texted me the next day saying she didn‚Äôt remember anything from the night before and trying to make up with me. I told her there was no chance and she went to a mental ward for a few months after that. She went on to marry a very unlucky bastard after dating him for only a few weeks. She‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm wary of rape accusations that aren‚Äôt made to the police.",

She was incredibly manipulative and mentally abusive. I put up with this for years because she said she deserved this relationship and I had to work hard to show her how much she did.\n\nI finally noped out of there after five years when her deluded logic became even more deranged. She said she deserved to be treated like a princess and I had no problem making her feel like my one and only. Over time she would get more and more upset at me having female friends, even ones we had both known. She kept telling me she was only friends with a lot of girls I knew because she HAD to make sure they weren't going to try and sleep with me. Her logic was that she could trust me but not any of the girls I was friends with and I just didnt understand because I wasn't a girl.\n\nI went on vacation (to an anime convention) telling me that she couldn't wait for me to come home from my stupid trip (I love anime) so she could be taken on a real vacation. She then told me their would be rules to follow on the trip, which I didn't know we would be taking, which were:\n\n1. I can't talk to females unless it was an emergency or with her permission/approval because it could lead to sex \n2. I can't look at other females unless they are employees of the establishment we are in because, again, it could lead to sex.\n3. I had to tell her how beautiful she was if she saw another female and talk down about said female\n4. I couldn't talk to ANY friends because this was our time and I already had my time with them.\n5. I couldn't talk to my family unless it was an emergency because, again, this was our time.\n6. I couldn't drink because I may get drunk and forget that I'm not allowed to talk to females.\n\nShe, then, demanded I come home early (con ends Sunday evening with a party Sunday night and a trip home Monday morning but she wanted me to leave Sunday morning). I, feeling defeated, agreed and hung up the phone. My friends, knowing what I put up with from her, got me drunk to cheer me up and I decided to nope right out that relationship once she text me the list of rules. Met a girl that night and we've been together 10 years, married for five. Best nope I ever noped.\n\nEdit: I've been editing my bad grammar, sorry",

            "text": "We had been dating for roughly six months when we went on our Valentine's date. About halfway through the date I realized the ONLY part of the date I was excited about was that we were at my favorite restaurant in town. I just didn't really like the guy very much anymore, and I thought \"well I have to end this because this isn't fair to either of us, but maybe not today\". And it was like he could read my mind, cue flaming red flags. The next day he asked me to move in with him. It was way too soon for me, especially considering our age gap (I was 23, he was 30), and practically speaking, I worked two jobs on the opposite side of town he lived, and was mid-semester of my LAST semester of college and CERTAINLY not looking to move. Cue him confessing to me that he's mostly asking because his lease is up within the next month and he doesn't think he can afford to take up another six month lease by himself. How romantic. And like a dumbass I thought \"well I don't want to kick him when he's down\" even though I should've ended the relationship right then and there.\n\nIt only went downhill from there. It was like dating my own personal stalker from there until the very end. He would call me at all hours of the day, blow up my phone with texts all throughout my classes. He suddenly could no longer understand why it was that I was spending all my additional free time doing school related work, like dude, I'm in my last semester of college, it's just a busy time. He got wildly upset when I point blank told him that my education was more important than him, and that I'll be damned if a man tried to stand in my way. We were also co-workers at one of my jobs at the time, and he would find any possible excuse to cut out of his work and come see me while I was doing mine. He even got me in trouble for it once.\n\nThe final straw to all this madness was about two weeks after our Valentine's date, he's blowing up my phone while I'm working at my second job, his new normal apparently. Telling me that he feels very neglected, school can't possibly be so hard that it takes up ALL of my free time outside of work, and he didn't see why I needed two jobs if I still lived with my parents anyway. At the end of my shift I walk out to the dark parking lot only to find him sitting in his car, parked right next to mine, with the seat pulled down low so that I couldn't see him. When I actually did see him and asked him what the actual fuck he thought he was doing, he jumped out of the car with a random present for me and proceeded to get very butthurt that I didn't fall all over him with gratitude, but instead called him out for stalking me at my place of work and scaring the shit out of me. I dumped him right then and there, with coworkers present and everything, where he proceeded to completely embarrass both him and me. He cried so hard he had snot running down his face like a toddler, was gasping for breath, flopped on the ground and screamed about how nobody would love him. Then proceeded to have the SINGLE SCARIEST emotional switch I've ever seen and started yelling at me nose to nose, talking about how he didn't feel like he could control himself, didn't know what he would do, and that I was a spiteful bitch who wanted to hurt him and make him throw away his sobriety. Good times. Thankfully, I have amazing coworkers and friends who helped me call his friends to come supervise him, gathered the presents he threw at me mid-tirade, and gave me a great big Girl Squad escort home.\nCovid locked my whole city down not even a whole month later and I FINALLY got the peace and freaking quiet I had been looking for, lol.",

            "text": "She used LSD while I was at work hours away and then started having a bad trip and wanted me to leave work to help her calm down. I couldn't leave cause it was a solar install job where I traveled to the job site with 3 others in a single vehicle meaning if I left everyone must leave and I'd lose my job most likely. I tried my best to help her over the phone to try to calm her down which seemed to help. But thinking back, that was probably the first of many red flags with her. How irresponsible can you be to use acid alone when you know you have mental health issues what if I couldn't calm her down over the phone. Even if I had left work it would probably be 3-4 hours before I'd be home. What if she hurt herself. One time one of my tires was a bit low on air from a small slow leak or something, totally drive able and we were stranded in a bad part of town and it was late so the tow company said they couldn't come. So I made the decision that we could drive the 3 miles home after all tire was still mostly full. While we were driving she started crying and freaking out saying we were going to die and then she started pounding on my passenger door over and over. I thought she was going to break the plastic interior panel. She was into occult and I tried to be supportive of that and was legitimately interested in her belief system. But one time she asked me to join her in a ritual that included smoking weed. I don't really smoke weed cause it gives me anxiety but I used to smoke a ton and used to love it so I agreed thinking it may be different this time. Yeah we did the ritual while I was higher than the moon, and my anxiety was going crazy because she was like speaking latin and it honestly felt too real to me like she was summoning the devil or something hahahaha. Anyway I told her I had to go to another room and she finished her ritual. That stuck with me though. It was in my mind so crazy seeing her like that. Speaking in tongues and stuff. I think she knew it bothered me cause actually from then on she wouldn't really don any of that stuff around me. She may have had an anxiety disorder or maybe other mental illnesses, maybe depression. I have depression as well, and eventually I just couldn't be supportive anymore. Our relationship ended long before we broke up but we were young and broke and living together. I think the moment it really ended was when I was driving us home from somewhere, and she said something like \"I'm starting to seek attention in places I shouldn't be and I wanted to let you know cause I think maybe you can stop me\" something like that. I didn't really understand what she was telling me. I sort of felt like she was saying that she wanted to cheat on me, but the way she said it was so vague I really didn't know, plus I was driving and a bit focused on that. I don't remember what I said, but basically she ended up cheating on me. And her reasoning when she told me and broke up with me was that I didn't stop her. And that I wasn't supportive of her. I didn't support her weight loss goals cause I still ate unhealthy foods while she was trying to cut them out. I didn't support her goals for me cause I wanted to work a trade instead of go to college. Like girl it's not my job to hold your hand through every aspect of your life don't blame me for your failures and lack of motivation. I don't force you to eat unhealthy and I'm a guy who is already thin, I don't want to lose weight we have different needs and most of all we both should be accountable for ourselves. I saw her a couple times after we ended our 4 year relationship and the most recent time, she had lost lots of weight but she was also addicted to caffeine pills to get her through the day. I think she basically developed an eating disorder and kept herself going with those pills. She also had dropped out of college. I feel bad cause despite these red flags, she really was awesome and we had some great times but at the same time I feel I dodged a bullet and now I've gotten to work on myself a lot now. We were truly just young and immature trying to grow up too fast and also thinking we knew everything. Hope she's doing well now.",

Cute, charming, loud, he was all around a perfect type of guy. He was crazy in the good way (hint: I was wrong) and made me laugh. He climbed medieval village walls, tried to throw me into a historical fountain (that happens to be internationally recognisable,) made me walk all the way out of this major foreign city with him and our two friends because we‚Äôd missed the last metro back due to his shenanigans. It was all just wild, good fun. Drunkingly singing stereotypical songs in the streets at night, crashing a random concert of some foreign pop band. You get the idea.\n\nAs all good things come to an end, we had to go back to the states after this program, which meant being 1000 miles apart. He was in an on/off relationship with a girl in his hometown, Midde-of-nowhere, USA. And I‚Äôd pretty much lost interest and wrote it off as just one life experience. We‚Äôd speak occasionally, but that meant singing happy birthday over the phone or commenting on posts, or normal catching up chatter. After a bit of time, maybe two years, we‚Äôve started talking more, flirting, taking about visits, etc. Then, he wants to FaceTime me.\n\nI‚Äôm like, sure, why not? Except it was like 11 pm, so I told him I needed to go to bed soon because of my 8 am theory class. So, the FaceTime call starts, I say maybe 4 or 5 sentences before he begins to talk. And talk. And talk. For 3 hours straight. At me, all one sided.\n\nThe contents is what freaked me the hell out. He went off by talking about religion (he is deeply Christian and I am not) and then that started to slide into his concept of people, their connection to god, and the like.\n\nHe though no one was connected to god like he was except maybe me. He wanted me to marry him. He wanted to write a book about his religion. He wanted to teach his ‚Äúreligion.‚Äù\n\nThe truly enlightened were us, the enlightened that stay one step below are the teachers, the level below those were scholars and philosophers, below that tier, were average people (who he believed weren‚Äôt real people, because they serve their purpose to take his food order or sweep the hallway etc.) and then the rest, were just empty nothings. It was so similar to solipsistic thinking, which can slip into Capgras syndrome really fast.\n\nI sat there and listened as he talked about fate, destiny, knowledge, true knowledge, and the tiers of humanity. When I questioned his thoughts, he insisted. He straight up said he doesn‚Äôt care to help anyone else if it doesn‚Äôt affect him. He would let a woman die if she was about to fall onto a train track, even if he could have grabbed her first.\n\nSo. I‚Äôm seeing Jim Jones and suicide cults and sociopaths all over inside my head. The whole call, I‚Äôm getting a pitted feeling in my stomach and a cold sweat. My spine feels like someone is crunching it and I felt like passing out.\n\nIt just went on and he was so sure in his thinking, it was honestly terrifying. I stopped talking to him at that point.\n\nI‚Äôm someone that was assaulted by my boyfriend when I was a teen, and this was still somehow more terrifying. With the assault, I knew it was only me that was in immediate danger, which was somewhat comforting. With this guy, I felt genuine terror for the rest of the world, because I am smart enough to see through the charm, but who says the next person he latches on to will be? What if they believe him, follow him? What if others do? What if he leads a following to hurt themselves or their families?",

Go away to her family's wedding, we had to be separated (i was 22 and she was 20, had been dating for 3 years). Obviously, we worked around it and had our fun as any teenager/youmg adult does. As we get older, she finally starts being \"allowed\" to stay at my house. Again, I'm probably 23 at this point, you know a full-blown adult. She is too. She sleeps at my house one weekend, all was good. The next weekend she says we were spending too much time together, she wants to stay home. OK, no big deal. Then she tells me she's staying at our mutual friend's house(it's a girl). Ok, it hurt a little but not yet big of deal. Until I found out afterwards that her friend also had a guy sleep over, who (different story for a different thread) I already didn't trust. After that, I ended it. I waited all those years for us to spend a night together and she decided she'd rather spend it with some other guy. Yes, it went down the path I assumed it would and she slept with him.

I had been dating my girlfriend for about 3 years.. we were very close and I even relocated from NYC for work and her in the beginning of the relationship... knew each other‚Äôs family‚Äôs very well, spent holidays together, etc... In January, she would subtly start to shame me and make me feel bad for not being the extremely happy outgoing person I was before the pandemic, instead of supporting these temporary feelings and realizing the reasons. However, she insisted that ‚Äúyou are my partner and my best friend, and I‚Äôm not going to leave you‚Äù. In February we decided we would live in Mexico City for 6 months starting in August and when we went to buy the plane tickets she insisted on putting it on her credit card, even though I had the money to pay for the tickets. She wanted the ‚Äúpoints‚Äù so I said okay and paid her my half of the tickets directly. I wanted to do anything I could to prevent any more debt for her since she can‚Äôt afford to pay off her student debt... She told me she would pay off the credit card immediately and that she had done so, however this ended up not being true. I confronted her about it and it turned into a week long argument. A month later, before Valentine‚Äôs Day she breaks up with me, shaming me non-stop and eventually after me trying to understand better, asked me to not communicate with her. Somehow made me feel like I had done something wrong to her in the process and I tried for months to get her back after. I should have left over the credit card thing but we had been together so long that I knew this was something tiny I could work through... Fast Forward, she cancels my ticket to Mexico that I paid for without talking to me, and I can‚Äôt get my money back now for a year, no voucher, no nothing. I was still going to take my trip. Today, I started my dream job and I am still stuck with these horrible feelings that I‚Äôve done something wrong to drive her away and we haven‚Äôt spoken for more than a month.

It all came to a head one day where I just really upset her and at this point I can‚Äôt even remember what I did to set her off. As soon as scjool let out she started berating me over text about how much she hates me and all the things I‚Äôd have to change about myself if I wanted to stay with her. She was relentless and the only break I got from it was when I went to SAT prep where I couldn‚Äôt have my phone on me. By the time I got out my phone had at least 30 more texts from her some of which complained about me not responding even though she knew I couldn‚Äôt. On the drive homethe texts kept coming and I started to have a complete panic attack. \nWhen I got how I tried to go immediately go to my room but my mom stopped me. God bless her because she could immediately tell something was wrong. I told her everything and broke down in tears in her arms. We talked and I decided to break up with her over text immediately. I sent her a text saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre done I can‚Äôt handle this anymore‚Äù which then sent her into a frenzy about how I couldn‚Äôt do this to her and how she wanted to stay together.

I let myself in with my own key to her place. She appeared to be sleeping on her mattress in the living room and refused to answer me. Completely sick of her at this point, I grabbed her purse and started rummaging through it, looking for my key.\n\nI couldn't find it.\n\nI angrily demanded to know where my key was but she kept ignoring me.\n\nJust as I started rifling through her apartment she hopped up off her mattress and screamed, \"HERE!\" and tossed my key right at my chest. She had been holding on to it the entire time.\n\nWithout a word I picked it up and then reminded her that she stole some of my food, too. Muttering, she ran into the kitchen, slammed open the refrigerator and pulled out my lettuce. She then threw it at me as hard as she could. Fortunately, she was not exactly a baseball player so the lettuce shot straight up and hit the ceiling in front of her, smashing apart and littering the floor at her feet with green leaves.\n\n\"\\[GF\\], you really need to grow up,\" I told her archly.\n\nAt least, that's what I wanted to say.\n\nWhat I actually said was, \"\\[GF\\], you r...\" before she screamed at me at the top of her lungs and lunged at me like a wild animal. Freaked, I quickly backed out of her apartment, putting the entry door between her and me.\n\nWHAM! WHAM! WHAM!\n\nShe started hurling herself at the door, banging it repeatedly with her fists and howling at the top of her lungs. There were no words- just nothing but angry, incoherent screams.\n\nMy legs shook as I ran down to my apartment, her tantrum in my ears the entire time. Even safely in my own apartment with a flight of stairs and two locked doors between us, I could still hear the noise from her place. I eventually had to put a fan in my bedroom window on full blast just to drown out the noise enough to get some sleep.\n\nThe next day, I ran into my other upstairs neighbor who simply said, \"Interesting night last night, huh?\"\n\nYears later, my ex-GF and I reconnected slightly on Facebook which for me was like having an ongoing traffic accident to gawk at, but after her 2020 feed was filled with nothing but Trump supporter propaganda and anti-mask, anti-vaccine content, I quietly unfriended her and said a silent prayer of thanks for the bullet I dodged.",

            "text": "Had been chatting w this chick I met on a dating app. We were on the same page: we wanted to talk a bit first before meeting. Esp because we lived about 1 and a half hours away from each other, so wanted to make sure it was worth it. We chatted for probably a month pretty casually. I liked her. Decided to go on a date for valentines day. She lived in the city so I went to her. Cool fun date to a concert (she paid) and then a planetarium and food after (I paid for that part). From the start she had been pretty honest about having just got out of a relationship. However, until the date it had sounded to me like it was a brief thing that she was over already.\n\nWoof did I misinterpret that.\n\nShe spent a lot of the date talking about her ex. Eventually showed me a tattoo of his name. (Always a red flag) I started to realize quickly that not only was I a rebound for something that was pretty serious, but also probably pretty unhealthy. They had broken up and got back together dozens of times. The way she spoke I just knew she wasnt over him.\n\nShe was really cool otherwise and the date was loads of fun. I knew maybe halfway thru that we weren't gonna work but I tried to just enjoy the ride. I declined a kiss at the end of the date and we went our separate ways.\n\nThe next few days I texted her infrequently. I was trying to decide if I should just ghost or if it was serious enough at this point I should give her a good reason. Eventually decided to just be real with her. In the meantime I was working and had a very busy 16 hour day. I got off shift and had about 40 texts and several missed calls from her. She had taken my silence (from working- I had texted her that morning) as being rude and absolutely gone off on me. It was completely unhinged and nuts for the level of our relationship and she said some pretty messed up shit in her anger. I had previously decided to be nice and not ghost but this was so crazy I just shook my head and blocked her.\n\nHope her and her main guy are doing well these days i guess",

            "text": "This happened two days ago. \n\nAfter a week of lying to me about cheating on me, he tried to tell me that me not trusting him was all in my head. Unfortunately for him, his best friend and I hung out and the friend accidentally let slip that my ex invited him to a sex party which was happening while my ex was supposed to be working, and suffering from a thrown out back. \n\nHaving promised not to get the friend in trouble and at the time not had actual proof, I tried all week to figure out if it was a miscommunication. I coincidentally was able to ask extremely pointed questions about the event without giving away that I knew. I am in hindsight extremely terrified and impressed by how instinctively he lied. He lied without giving it conscious thought, while doing multiple other tasks and supposedly on pain medication. \n\nSo Friday I told him I was having trouble trusting him. As it turns out when I put a little thought into things a lot didn‚Äôt add up. Like Friday morning when I asked to FaceTime him I noticed that he had rearranged all his furniture while having a back so bad he could barely walk sometimes. Or how he also left his heating pad and back brace at my place, despite saying how much they helped him. Or many other things, like stories diverging between what he told me and what he told other people in front of me, or how his stories evolved over time to give just a little bit more truth each time, or how he was constantly on the hook up apps but insisting he wasn‚Äôt hooking up and was only using them for socializing, etc.\n\nHe latched onto that last one and dramatically deleted the apps in front of me, telling me he chooses me instead of them. An hour later he re-installed one to find a three-way for us that I didn‚Äôt ask for. I rolled with it because he did say he wanted the three-way before doing it, but it didn‚Äôt sit well with me. In the morning when I got up I decided to see if he was still using them despite saying he wouldn‚Äôt. And he of course was logged on.\n\nI confronted him about it and he made excuses and lies and deflected things back at me. The last straw for the conversation was when I told him I had very real reasons to find him not trustworthy, and he responded that it was all in my head. Gaslight 101.\n\nI finally let slip that I had heard a rumor he had hooked up the week before. I asked him yet again directly if he had hooked up and he said no. Then he texted some mean things and insisted he needed to go the hospital for his back. But he wouldn‚Äôt let me come help, and he was at the hospital and pharmacy all day long.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt until much later that night that he came over and finally admitted, angrily that he had, in fact, hooked up. I broke up with him that moment.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the thing. We had an open relationship, and all he had to do to not have been cheating was to tell me before hand and invite me to join. He had no reason to do what he did and even more reason to not lie about it. It is baffling to me what he did and I have to accept that I will never understand it, because it made no sense.",

Invites me to his graduation across the country (I was on the east coast USA, he on the west coast). I said I wasn't interested and besides it would be a long and expensive flight. He said he'd pay for it. I reiterated I wasn't interested. He kept trying to convince me.\n\nFlying to visit family, my flight was cancelled; couldn't go back to school because the dorms were closed. Stayed in a hotel. He asked for the address so he could send me food. I refused, saying I had plenty of snacks. He said he'd get doordash and kept pushing. Started guessing hotels. I told him to stop and I wasn't telling him. He asked when my flight was in the morning so he could call and wake me up. Told him I had an alarm. He insisted, I refused to give him my number. Went to bed. Woke up to my alarm and three missed calls on Facebook from him. Lots of worried messages. I told him I was going to get less responsive. Didn't open Facebook for three days to avoid him. Had 50 messages. Responded saying I told him I wasn't going to be responsive. He said he'd thought I'd died and I needed to give him my number and the addresses of everywhere I'd be visiting and when so he could figure out whether I was OK. I told him he was being obsessive and to back off. He said, and I quote, \"I'm not being obsessive I just think about you every second of every day\".\n\nFinally got him to back off a little. He said he wanted to send me a birthday present. I said I don't need or want one. He insisted, asking for the address of where I'd be on my birthday. I finally gave him my college mail box (central location not close to my dorm). When I got back to school after my birthday, I had a huge box - it had a smart watch, an expensive HoNY book, a giant thing of goldfish crackers, ornaments, movies - I don't even remember everything. The smart watch alone was $250 - and not compatible with my phone. I told him that was the final straw, he obviously wasn't backing off enough and it was creeping me out. I told him I was going to return the box, and he begged me not to so I gave most of the stuff away to friends. The goldfish were tasty though.",

            "text": "TL:DR divorced abusive husband after chatting with a Buddy one night. Went from meek and submissive to confident Queen in a matter of a few hours thanks to the convo. Remained good buddies for a few years and after having coffee one day we hugged goodbye and suddenly realized we never wanted to let go.  \nI married at 19 to my HS sweetheart. We‚Äôd been together 4.5 years by then and it was generally accepted we‚Äôd get married. He was very possessive and controlling but like so so so many victims of domestic abuse I didn‚Äôt register this was abuse because he never hit me. Being that I was 15 when we started dating I was essentially groomed into this dysfunctional dynamic, and while I accept no blame in his actions I also don‚Äôt blame him entirely as his relationship skills were a product of his upbringing. \nJust shy of my 24th birthday I went out for drinks with my coworkers, make and female, but I had to say I was with the girls only so he wouldn‚Äôt be mad. Somewhere between sober and unable to drive it clicked that I shouldn‚Äôt be afraid of being honest but that‚Äôs not the moment I up and Noped. We all bar hopped a bit and I found myself at my coworker‚Äôs house laying on the sofa with a friend-desperate to stop the room from spinning. We talked all night and suddenly it was 430am. My first thought was ‚Äú Holy Jesus he‚Äôs going to beat the shiza out of me!‚Äù I rushed home and arrived at 5am, heading straight to the shower because I smelled of cigarette smoke, and I was not permitted to smoke. In a rage he left for school before I got out of the bathroom and all I could think about was how he was going to kill me. Genuine terror. I was home when he got home from class and before he could say one word I looked him dead in the eye and said ‚ÄúI want a divorce‚Äù and walked out the door. \nSomewhere in my fear driven shower thoughts I realized that I had just spent the last 12 hours feeling free, respected, and beautiful. Harmless flirtation between opposite sex friends made me believe someone could, in fact, find me attractive-despite being told daily I wasn‚Äôt. True friends build you up and if all it took was one night out and a couple compliments to make me feel joy and confidence for the first time in years...I needed to get out. The epiphany that I was worthy, that I had value, paired with knowing I may only have a few hours left to live made me stand up for the first time and take control. \nAfter 9 years together it took just 12 hours to wake up and Nope out. \nThe divorce was final 2 days after my 24th birthday. The male friend (the one I spent that fateful night talking to) and I remained long distance friends for a couple years and one day he said he would be driving through my city and invited me for a quick cup of coffee. I happily accepted, I hadn‚Äôt seen my buddy in 18m and was excited for a visit. I knew from other friends his 3y engagement had been called off about 6 months earlier (toxic relationship-all our friends hated her so nobody ever really talked about their relationship, he didn‚Äôt even tell anyone they‚Äôd gotten engaged knowing the friends wouldn‚Äôt approve) but didn‚Äôt think anything of it except to say I was sorry to hear about the breakup. We met up at the coffee shop, talked as comfortably as always, and as we were leaving we shared our customary hug and a cheek kiss. But the hug lasted a moment longer than normal. Then he turned slightly when I went for the cheek kiss and the corners of our mouths touched. Still hugging I leaned back to look at him and like a scene from a romantic movie we met in the middle for a real kiss. Fireworks exploded in my head, my belly suddenly full of butterflies, my whole body unable to move... been together 18 years now, still get butterflies when I look at him, and he treats me like a Queen.",

He repeatedly told me I didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù or a ‚Äúreal degree‚Äù, even though I was the only one of us actually who had actually graduated and worked to financially support us.  He blamed me for causing the pandemic because ‚Äúmy people‚Äù brought it here.  One night, he restrained me during a fight and hit me, and somehow made me beg for his forgiveness and promise to ‚Äútake this night to my grave‚Äù.\n\nStill, I stayed.  Nothing he could have done would have made me leave him.  He had manipulated me to believe that if we ever separated, it was because I didn‚Äôt try hard enough, and I never loved him anyway.\n\nI went on a walk with a coworker one afternoon.

            "text": "My ex boyfriend was in every way abusive towards me and I was pregnant with my daughter while we were together. If you‚Äôve ever been in an abusive relationship than you probably understand how difficult it is to leave. One of those kinds of abuse was controlling and manipulating me. A little bit of backstory, we weren‚Äôt exactly in the best place of our lives more so him than me as we had been doing drugs together before I got pregnant and I sobered up immediately after I found out and so did he or so I thought and went back home but he was homeless. Being pregnant I was already tired enough and it was no help that it was exhausting to be with him but he would force me to go out with him every single day while we just walked around aimlessly for hours with nothing to do and nowhere to go and no money. He would come to my house early in the morning and knock on the window until I woke up or blew up my phone to tell me to leave and he would get upset at me if I didn‚Äôt. And when we were together he‚Äôd keep me out until late at night and he‚Äôd sometimes try to keep me from going home to stay out on the street with him. While we‚Äôd hang out he‚Äôd take my phone away from me to keep me from calling my mom, he would take my hair tie off my wrist because he wanted my hair down even if I got hot and wanted it up, I constantly felt like I was walking on glass with everything I said because he was EXTREMELY insecure and sensitive and if I said the wrong thing or if he took something the wrong way I‚Äôd get hit or yelled at. He was always calling me names and checking my phone to see if I texted anybody new, at that point I had already pushed every single one of my friends out of my life because he hated them all, even the female friends. What really got me to finally leave was that even after I‚Äôd given birth, he was still doing these things. Being a new mom at that point, I had just reached a whole new level of dont fuck with me or my baby. So what really set me off was that he would threaten to kidnap my daughter if I didn‚Äôt cooperate with his every need. At that point, I couldn‚Äôt just up and leave but I had to really figure a way out. I started showing less affection when he asked for it, I started fighting back when he would start getting physical with me, and I wouldn‚Äôt allow him to have my phone or go into my house anymore and I let him know that I‚Äôd start telling everyone who he really was. And exactly how I had expected, he eventually grew tired of not getting what he wanted. After I broke up with him he surprisingly didn‚Äôt try getting back with me like usual and I was relieved. He moved on with another girl a week later and went straight ‚Äúback‚Äù to drugs (Quoting back because I later found out that he had been hiding getting high from me even after promising he was sober). We were together for a year and about 4 months and my daughter was just less than a year old at this point. I cut him off completely after that and kept my daughter away from him for her safety. He died two years ago, two years after our breakup, in a car accident on my 21st birthday. Dying on my birthday kind of felt like his last big fuck you.\n\nTL;DR- Was pregnant and in an abusive relationship. He threatened to kidnap my daughter if I broke up with him. Escaped a year and 4 months later. Cut him off completely. He died two years later on my birthday.",

We start dancing and my friends were all floored that I‚Äôm making out with this supermodel. I‚Äôm a tall handsome guy, but can safely say this woman was out of my league. I walk her to her car and she gives me a blowjob and spends the weekend with me. One of the greatest nights of my life. \n\nWe dated for around 4 months. Completely inseparable. Showered her with gifts and was head of heels in love. Was planning on proposing. She told me about her abusive ex and how i was everything she ever wanted. She surprised me on my birthday with allowing me to have anal sex with her, I asked her about doing it and we both never did it before. We both had a good time. \n\nOne day she just didn‚Äôt call or text, no biggie because I‚Äôm not a type that needs to know what you‚Äôre doing 24/7 and everyone needs space. Had a fun dudes night out. Next day, same thing. Didn‚Äôt respond to the few texts I sent and call went straight to voicemail. End of day 3 her mom called me wondering where she is as her job called her looking for her. We are both worried now. End of day 4 she shows up to my place around midnight. \n\nShe looked like she hadn‚Äôt slept or showered in days. I asked her where she‚Äôs been and she didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. Lays down on the bed and she starts going down on me. She then stopped and said, ‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù and bit my dick very hard. She starts screaming nonsense and kept punching me and scratched my face so bad it drew blood. Starts destroying my room. I call the cops because I can‚Äôt get her to settle down and want her gone now. The cops handcuff her and put her in the car. Discover she‚Äôs on probation for domestic violence and the officers tell me she‚Äôll probably be in jail for awhile if I press charges. I didn‚Äôt want her locked up, just gone. Officer gives me the case number and how to get a peace warrant. They stick around to make sure she leaves and I tell her I‚Äôll drop her stuff at her moms. \n\nA week or so goes by and everything is getting back to normal for me. I was heartbroken but knew I couldn‚Äôt be with someone capable of acting like that. \nThen the phone calls and texts started. Hundreds a day. My voicemail was flooded with messages about how much she loves me and wants to try again. I never reply and change my number. Then she started showing up wherever I was and creating a scene. I had to quit my job because it was getting to be too much. Then she started showing up to my place all the time and now I‚Äôm getting scared. Being stalked was terrifying. She was telling everyone i beat her all the time and was a monster. How i forced her to have anal sex and that it was rape. Went on for about a month until someone discovered she was seeing someone new. A dude that weirdly looked just like me. \n\nI decided to visit her ‚Äúabusive‚Äù ex because I knew where he worked. He, again, shockingly resembled me, so she had a type. Introduce myself and how I knew of him, and he said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get a beer‚Äù. We started swapping stories and they were almost IDENTICAL. He discovered she had a crystal meth problem. When she vanished on him she was at her ‚Äúuncles‚Äù who was a known trashy redneck drug dealer. She stalked him too until I came along so he was relieved to be free of her but wanted to warn me so much and he was sorry. Me and him are friends to this day and was a groomsman at his wedding. I decided to warn the new guy but he didn‚Äôt believe me and called me a rapist. He apologized months later when the same events happened to him. \n\nIt‚Äôs been a decade now and I still get the occasional facebook friend request and messages from her. Don‚Äôt respond to either.

We went to a couple social events together at a local bar, and each time I had to drive because he didn't have a car (NBD until...), each time I would take him back to his place and he would break into tipsy tears at how he just hasn't felt this way in so long and he felt so close to me.  I was recently divorced and had VERY clearly told him it was going to be a while before I wanted a serious relationship.  We went separately to a fundraiser for the charity we were involved in, and while I was working the event he got drunk and dragged a bunch of people outside to cry about me ignoring him and how he is \"just a burden on everyone\".  I had allowed him to change from his work clothes into his party clothes in my hotel room (I had a female friend staying with me and she was there to keep everything polite), and at the end of the party he interrupted me visiting with friends to demand to be let into my room.  I took him up there and let him gather his things, the whole time he was going on about how I had led him on and lied to him.  \n\nIt was too much for someone I had gone on three dates with.  I told him that he has many qualities but that we aren't compatible, mainly because he wants more from me than I was capable of giving at that time.  \n\nHe apologized the next day, asked if we could be friends and I said of course.  A couple weeks later, he flipped out when I brought a different date to a group event, and said some really horrible things about me betraying him.  I told him the door was closed on us being friends, and he posted ugly things about me on social media for a week or two after.\n\nThe real funny thing is, the charity group we were in was a group of superhero cosplayers who do children's charity events, and this guy, of all heroes, cosplayed as Captain America.  Couldn't be further from it when it came to shared virtues.",

Actually I'm so glad he said it so I could get rid of his toxic ass at once lol (also I got in a super sweet relationship a month after this happened, it's been going for more than a year and things couldn't be better)",

My mom had just had surgery to remove breast cancer the day before and was just agitated with everyone (had like four families together in one house for the holidays, just bad idea all around) so wanted to get a hotel and get some peace. My husband was smashed and we were quietly pissed off at each other all day/weekend, although not sure why he was even mad at me, probably for being mad at him. \nThis is at like midnight, my brother takes my mom to a hotel and I tell her I‚Äôd meet her there to stay with her. My youngest kid (1.5 at the time) was still awake with the ruckus of drunk family so I take her with me to get some sleep at the room, left husband with the rest of my family and sleeping kid. Forgot my bag, call him to ask to bring it out to me, then ask him to drive around and talk so we didn‚Äôt go to bed angry. I tried confiding in him, telling him why I was upset and apologizing (cause that‚Äôs what I always do) and kinda breaking down admitting I was having a really hard time with my moms cancer situation. He interrupted by yelling at me, saying things like, ‚ÄúYOU think YOURE having a hard time!? What about ME!?‚Äù (He literally had nothing going on in life other than not having work, which he was not complaining about, and then I guess being married to me and having kids and no other responsibilities cause his mom paid for whatever he couldn‚Äôt..). I realize he‚Äôs too far gone to have an actual conversation with so I turn around to take him back to the house, this is where he starts beating the shit out of me, while I‚Äôm driving, with our kid in the back. \nI pulled over immediately, he keeps punching, finally gets out of the car (it‚Äôs like 10 degrees out, no jacket) yells some more hurtful shit before slamming the car and running off. I had to tell my family cause I was worried he‚Äôd try taking our other kid or go kill himself or something, they kicked him to the curb but at least tossed a jacket out. He ended up sleeping in a casino back room stall and I found and took him to the airport the next day without saying much other than him telling me he wants a divorce. He disappeared for about a week going back and forth between wanting to die and wanting to get the kids away from me forever and making my life miserable. He still makes my life miserable, but at least it‚Äôs not daily anymore. I put up with a LOT in that relationship, but don‚Äôt you fucking dare put my kids in danger. \nSad part is though, if the kid wasn‚Äôt back there, I‚Äôd probably still try to make things work.

I talked to her and ended up getting her Snapchat and later messeged her. Here's the 1st red flag. After asking her out to an ice cream date she agreed but told me she had to break up with her boyfriend first. This made me anxious at first and told her I don't want to go out with someone that is currently dating someone but she told me she had been trying to dump him for months but he wouldn't leave her alone. Made sense to me so I bought cause I was a dumb 20 year old. \n\nRed flag #2 She refused to ever tell her parents or anyone in her family that we were dating and just told them I was her friend from a play we were both in. Keep in mind I was spending the nights with her and constantly at her house. She would mention her ex boyfriend to her parents as if they were still dating. I brought this up and she hand waved this away saying her parents were super controlling and it was just easier this way. \n\nRed Flag #3 She refused to show any type of PDA like wouldn't even hold my hand or hig me in public ever. I asked her why and she just said she didn't like PDA which made sense to me. Her \"ex boyfriend\" also attended the same college as us. You getting the idea yet?? \n\nRed Flag #4 I had been having some serious mental health issues and the three above mentioned things were really straining my mental health because I felt like she was possibly still with her \"ex boyfriend\" and one night I saw her send message that said \"I love you too, and I'll see you tomorrow\" to him and I kinda lost my cool, I'll admit I freaked out and that wasn't cool and damaged our already fragile relationship. \n\nThe 5th and Final red Flag was that she was going to a concert alone with her ex boyfriend and tried to gaslight me into think she had already told me even tho she hadn't and was trying to hide who she was going with. Queue me booking an emergency appointment with my then therapist who told me that I have two options the one he recommends which is dumping her and the other which is just letting her know that I trust her thru a text message. I chose the later because once again I was a dumb 20 year old. \n\nFlash forward a week where she is talking about going over to a friend's house and seeing two boxers (the dog breed) she hadn't seen in a long time, the only person who had boxer breed for a dog was her ex boyfriend. She then asked me if I trusted her which I replied yes to. I then asked her the same thing and she replied \"IDK sometimes you do really shady things\" keep in mind I only ever went over to my friends house to hangout with who she called \"My bros\" to drink a little beer, maybe play some Mario party and went to school/work/the theatre for rehearsals. \n\nI just replied \"Oh my fucking god, I can't fucking do this anymore.\" At first she was confused and I just explained it as \"THIS, this constant bullshit between us. It's so fucking tiring and I can't do it anymore. I'm done. I'm leaving you.\" \n\nI went to college the next day and sure as shit she was all cuddled up with her ex, holding his hand, all that bullshit. I just solace in the fact that I knew she was fucking playing me and that I finally stood up for myself. \n\nOh and if this helps explain any of her actions, she was massively bipolar and refused to take her meds.",

She was the first person I loved and was devastated when we broke up. We lost contact until after I graduated and left for boot camp in the summer. \n\nI come back from boot camp and training and we reconnected and got back together. I moved from VA to CA and we made it work, eventually marrying a year later. She moved all the way to CA and we were together for a total of 6 years. \n\nI have to say I was happy for a long time. Then she told me she cheated on me while in college back in VA before we were married. For some reason I looked past all of this and continued with the relationship. Then around 4 years in things changed. \n\nShe became abusive and stopped working and going to school. If she did get a job it was only for a few months until she quit. She blamed everything on depression which I accepted and tried to understand and help her deal with. I didn‚Äôt mind at the time that she wasn‚Äôt working since I could support both of us, but then she started getting heavily into drugs and alcohol. I eventually started drinking with her daily since that was the only time we both were tolerable to each other. \n\nOf course I didn‚Äôt realize at the time how detrimental this was and it was like a ticking time bomb waiting to go off. I think it was because I was afraid of being alone or not finding anybody else but who knows.\n\nThen it happens, we argue one night and I get put in the hospital with injuries requiring stitches and she gets arrested. You‚Äôd think this was the end, but alas I was too stupid or naive to change. \n\nI got her out of jail and no charges were filed. We attended counseling which turned out did not help. But things continued for another couple of years. The fighting came back and drinking as well. She sunk more into drugs with the drinking and threatened to kill herself if we broke up. \n\nMy time in the military was coming to an end and I was getting ready to start college while working a full time job with her..... doing nothing. This of course caused more problems which again, I tried to look past.\n\nThen the abuse started again, and I tried every day to be as peaceful as possible in hopes of making it work, that didn‚Äôt happen. But there was an opportunity that presented itself for me to get out.\n\nShe said she was going back across the country to visit her mom which somehow turned into an arguement and I told her I wanted to end things. Her flight wasn‚Äôt for a couple days and those were terrible days. Eventually though, she left, not saying if she was coming back or not.\n\nI was alone for a month with my dog and cat. They were my saviors. They kept me going every day as I spent what little money I had on alcohol. Soon I realized I needed to figure out a way to get out of that place. I called my mom and she flew all the way across the country to pack up whatever we could in my car and drive back to VA. Anything that didn‚Äôt fit, got thrown away. \n\nIn that time, she returned and took her stuff as well as the animals without incident. I was stuck with paying all the fees when breaking my apartment lease but I had just enough to make the trip home.\n\nOnce home, I did all the work to file for divorce and it was finished, I was finally free and I have never felt so great in my life. I was still depressed and completely broke not knowing what to do but at least I was free from a daily torment slowly breaking me. \n\nFast forward to present day and I am with the love of my life that I had cast aside as a friend in high school.

To the point where he would have panic attacks if we weren't together and sometimes while we were trying to hang out with friends, causing us to have to go home so I could take care of him. I realized 3 months later that the relationship was toxic. His paranoia over loosing me was too high and I needed very much to get out of the relationship for my own mental health. After I left him, he threatened to commit suicide and started stalking/harassing me. No amount of explaining my side of things or talking about it changed his behavior. He would beg over and over again for one last meeting and our conversations would go round and round in circles. The last time I agreed to meet with him, he blocked me from leaving, held me down, was screaming and crying, and tried to coerce me into have sex with him, but couldn't get an erection. I slipped away while he was in hysterics, then he threw himself in front of my moving car while I tried to drive away. I went no contact and he continued to stalk me. Eventually showing up to my house after finding my new address online. I had to move, change all my contact information and delete social media. I was told I couldn't get a restraining order because he hadn't actually threatened physical violence or hit/choked me (he did punch a lot of walls though). No contact from me 2-3 years later, but I still get the occasional email from him to my dead account with the same threats of suicide and that he'd always be there if I ever wanted to talk again. I've considered trying to get a no-contact order, but going through the court system means potentially having to see him again, so I'm just waiting it out.

I told him the bathroom (where I was originally going) and he let me go but told me to \"be quick\" \nI grabbed a friend and we left-driving three hours straight to her house. I texted him to never call me or contact me again. He tried for a few months but because our families knew each otyer I think he was afraid to really harass me as I'd told his and my family.\nTen years later and he has been in and out of jail and rehab so many times I stopped paying attention.",

            "text": "This girl (we'll call her Megan) I was seeing started having other guys over to stay the night at her apartment. Most people would draw the line right there, but I've never really been the jealous type. I asked her if she was sleeping with them and she swore she wasn't. At this point I knew her pretty well, but she was odd, so I wasn't sure if she was lying. I stuck with her, because she would always beg me to stay and tell me she loved me if I even hinted at us not working out. Eventually, she became obsessed with me and started to act really strangely, like losing her mind kind of strange. So I suggested we stop drinking, thinking maybe it was an affect of too much alcohol. She was drinking at least 6 IPAs a night (I wasn't much better, so I never judged her for that just wanted her mind to start working again). \n\nAfter about 3 days not drinking, I get a call from her mother yelling at me asking what I did to her. I asked her what she meant and she yelled that she was missing. \n\nHer friend found my number and called to ask if I had heard from Megan. I said no, but said I was trying to find her. Megan's friend said they were supposed to meet for her lunch break but Megan never showed. Then I heard from her work that she never returned to work from her break. \n\nHer mother finally called me, they found her wandering through a very deep ravine (I'm not sure how they tracked her down). She was hospitalized for being incoherent. So, I panicked, left work and fled to the hospital. She was facedown on a hospital bed with a ton of family members surrounding her because she kept asking for specific people to show up to hold her over until I could get there.\n\nHer mother thought I \"did something\" to her, because her strange ramblings all revolved around how great I was and how unlikely it was the universe would bring us together. When I arrived at the hospital she asked everyone to leave but me. She begged me to tell her what was happening. I calmly explained to her that nothing was happening outside, no one was planning anything or pranking her. I said that stress may have just caught up with her. She asked if someone was scratching her foot. I explained that it could be a somatic hallucination and that everything was ok. She asked me if she was losing her mind and I explained that it was pretty unlikely. Well just have to hear from the doctors. She said I could leave because she wanted to talk to her mother. \n\nI left her side went out the nearest exit I could find, hid behind a transformer and cried my eyes out. I was tough in front of her because she needed that, but I was so fucking scared on the inside. I thought having her stop drinking would save her from whatever was happening, then I realized, it could be DTs due to alcohol withdrawal. \n\nWe stayed together for several more months. She asked me to move in with her. I was hesitant, but I did it. We were sober for several months. She was back to her brilliant self and we were a good influence on each other. \n\nThen, she started drinking again. Which was fine, I didn't expect us to be tea totlers forever. But the drinking got a little heavier, which was what she was doing when I met her, so it wasn't something that drove me away even though I still wasn't drinking. \n\nShe started acting a little strange again, but this time instead of being obsessed with me, her weirdness was accompanied with being irritated by me. When an episode would happen, she would get hypercritical about every behavior of mine. That didn't drive me away because I thought, we got through worse than this, way worse, I just don't want her to end up there again. So, I stayed (even though I was starting to feel uncomfortable).\n\nShe started disappearing for hours at a time while we lived together. She wouldn't answer her texts or anything. But no matter how negative she acted,  one thing that always turned her around from negative to positive was to send her shirtless pictures. Sometimes a literal 180. She had a very high labido and I would rather her be fun crazy than sad crazy, so in desperate times I would send her a topless pic and she'd show up within minutes. \n\nShe had been treating me like garbage for over a week, and she had been acting beligerent again (except bad beligerent rather that enthusiastic beligerent). Eventually, I had run out of everything in my bring-her-back-down-to-earth arsenal (calming words, reminding her that I love her, being understanding about basically everything). \n\nThen one night, she never came home from work. I waited, I didn't text, I didn't call. When I would text if she was 3 hours late coming home (even if she and I had explicit plans) she would accuse me of tracking her every move, so I waited. \n\nIt got to be the middle of the night, she and I were supposed to watch a thrift show she liked on Netflix that day, so I texted I tried the last thing that always worked. I was in her room, ready for bed and I sent a shirtless pic with the caption saying, \"if I don't hear from you, just letting you know, I'm ready for bed. ;)\" \n\nHer response was in all caps \"IN ***MY*** BED!!!??\"\n\nAt first I was confused, then I was pissed, then I was confused again. We had been sleeping in her bed together for over 2 months. There was no discussion, reason, indication or even a hint that we would do anything different. \n\nSo, the bed I slept in for more than 60 nights was suddenly off limits to me from a girl who I never set any limits with. She either lost her mind again and didn't remember that we sleep in the same bed every night or she was cheating again and someone near her saw my picture message and recognized her room (because he had been there). So I packed up all of my things and spent the next 2 weeks homeless (sleeping at friends houses so it wasn't so bad, don't feel bad for me, I was more than fine and very lucky). \n\nI should have noped out way earlier, but we had been through so much that I thought I really loved her. I never felt more pain than when she was hospitalized. But when the girl I was dating and living with started behaving like I didn't live in my own home, that was nope time.",

Again, it'd only been a week since we met. Red flag to end things should've been that he asked me to be his gf while he was driving me home through a rural area I wasn't familiar with right after he laughed and mentioned the bag in the backseat was his guns. \n\nThen, I guess he got paranoid about my uncertainty and having a life. Often, I worked and hung with friends/roomates during the day and he would message me so much if I didn't answer. Once in a single hour, he called 5 times, texted a bunch, fb messaged, snap chatted, created a twitter account and DMed me. I should've ended it there, so many red flags, but I know how it feels to like someone more than they like you and it's no fun feeling like you haven't been given a fair shot. I gave him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOn two occasions he pretended his heart failed and had his \"friend\" text me from his number about it. He texted me paragraphs about how he had fallen in love but his life was complicated so he understood if I wanted to leave. Like way to put me in that position. \"I'm dying, but you can end things\". He knew I was too nice to do that. When he would \"pass out\" or \"go into surgery\" or when I took too long to answer, his \"friend\" would text. The \"friend\" was pretty rude and blunt to me to sum that up. And outside of all that, I started to realize he wasn't the kind guy I thought based on some phone calls and him phrasing things as a joke, when he was really just being offensive and demeaning. \n\nI was at his place a couple days after his \"open heart surgery\" and I saw him shirtless and all he had was a strip of duct tape because he doesn't trust hospitals or doctors or whatever and that's also why he was \"discharged before the doctors wanted him to leave\". Real fishy, but I was alone with him at his apartment, an hour away from where I was staying/went to school and for my safety played along, though I was over it all at this point. I knew. I didn't admit it to myself til I was back at my friend's, safe, and away from him.\n\nAlmost 3 weeks after we met, I ended things via phone call. \n\nHe virtually stalked me for over a year and I had nightmares for that entire time every night that I was being chased. And that's why I had no interest in dating my senior year of college. Was just happy that the summer we went out I was couch hopping and he never actually knew where I lived. \n\nIt all escalated so fast and I know in the moment he'd lied pretty well about things, but this all seems so crazy to me now. I mean it did then, but it was hard to process and believe, especially when I was in danger.\n\nHe lived near Syracuse, NY and probably still does, so message me a name if you're worried about someone you dated who's in their mid-/late-20s now and I'll confirm if it's him. His first name starts with C. Stay safe out there.\n\n(Sidenote: he lied about a lot, but I did my research enough to know he wasn't lying about his identity, so before some of these events, I felt safe enough to get into his car and go to his apartment. And my friends always had my location. I prob could've beaten him in a weaponless fight too.)",

He spent a lot if time on her hair and always sent her to school in ruffled dresses that made her look like she was competing in a beauty contest.   He also said that as soon as she was old enough to potty train, he started peeing sitting down to help her learn, but then he just kept doing it that way because he didn't want to confuse her.  I think he probably made her very confused.  Despite these weird habits, he was not the least bit effeminate.  When he visited my apartment, he wanted to see my 4 month old son's room and he was very sweet with my son.  Even though i liked him a lot, I was a little weirded out by all this.  I did not get any creeper vibes from him, so now that I'm older I wonder if these things were probably just a very misguided attempt to impress me with his daddy skills.

She said she still wanted to do the date and so I told her when my ex tells me she's bringing him, I'd have to leave, which she said was fine. I gave her the restaurant address but she insisted on wanting to park at my house and walk up to the restaurant instead of meeting there. Eventually I gave her my street but not my house and we met up. She was nice, she definitely had some old/doctored pics on her account because she was significantly larger than her pictures. But we had clicked and everyone fudges their profile a bit, though this was a good bit more than a bit. Anyhow we went up to eat. \n\nThe whole time is just her talking, I mean she talks over everything and anything I tried to say. Whatever some people are nervous talkers. But then she started being a bitch to the bar tender too. But the kicker was when my phone finally went off so I checked it was my ex saying they were leaving soon. I let my date know and asked for the check. The moment i I sat my phone down on the table, this chick grabs it and SHOVES IT DOWN HER BRA!! This was a brand new Note 2 with a price leather case, the whole of which I'd only had for a week or two. This is a large woman, with large \"frontal equipment\" and we all know how that starts to perspire after some time. \n\nI basically had to tell at this woman in a restaurant to get my fucking phone back. The moment she handed it to me I bolted, literally ran. I told the host I lived down the road and Id come back to pay (they had all seen this happen, and I was a regular so they understood) This chick stood in the middle of of my road SCREAMING my name asking to come in and \"kick my ex's ass\" (idk where the fuck that came from, I was pretty cool with my ex back then) Needless to say I blocked every method of contact I had for her while she still stood in my street screaming. Eventually someone yelled they were gonna call the cops and she bailed. \n\n2 weeks later I got a phone call from a local number that I didn't have saved. Answered if and there she was, begging for a second chance, asking what she did wrong. I told her if she ever called me again I'd file whatever I could to get her to leave me alone.

But over time it got much darker, and more talks about suicide but just like joking around like suicide isn‚Äôt a big fuckin deal. \n\nShe did this so I could give her attention and console her and stress out about her all day and worry if she‚Äôs gonna kill her self. She would send me pictures of a hand full of pills and say how she takes them all at once to feel numb. Send me pictures of her fresh cuts and say it was my fault because I‚Äôm not helping her. I was helping her, I‚Äôd always talk to her when she was down and call her and listen and try to offer advice, I even helped her lose weight and get in shape. (She asked me to help her, I‚Äôd didn‚Äôt force her) spent hours doin research on how she should work out for her body, help her with her goals, make meals plans for her and adjust them for stuff that she liked. I did so much for her, I supported her with everything. And yet still, none of it was enough.\n\n  I broke up with her after a couple months of that her shitting on me and manipulating me with her scares and carving my name in her arm, and her showing up at my work to try and get me fired. \nWe‚Äôd been broken up for about 2-3 weeks and I had to call the cops on her and get a restraining order when she started following me and my friend around saying that she was going to kill her self and she has a gun in the car (it was her moms car and her mom always kept a gun in her car) pulled over to talk to her but like had to pull her out and calm her down while my friend looked in the car for a gun.  All while I‚Äôm absolutely sobbing to her begging her to stop and that I love her still ( I did not, I just didn‚Äôt want her to die because of me) just begging and begging her. All of this happening on some side dirt  road out in a country town at like 10pm. Mind you she was also 2 years older than me at the time. I had to give up because my mom was calling asking where The fuck I was. I told her I loved her then I left , ( I had to be home 2 hours ago. I was never late, I‚Äôm a good boy) called the cops on the way home like a blubbering fool. Got a restraining order. She and her family tried to get me in trouble and try to start shit with my family because of that incident. Because I was trying to save her from herself. I was being her punching bag, I called the cops because I wanted them to take her to a hospital to calm her down. They didn‚Äôt understand. For almost a year after she was stalking me and would pop up on fake accounts or new numbers asking about girls I was talking to. She seriously fucked me up and made me lose a lot of trust in girls. That‚Äôs was years ago. I‚Äôm good now. Now I‚Äôm happy as could be with my lovely girlfriend of two years and we live together. We have our ups and downs but everything is perfect with her.",

(During that time, I was being suspicious that she was cheating on me)\n\nA fast forward a few months later and she was late. Went to the doctor, found out she was pregnant. We were confused, young, that didn't stop her from treating me worst in the process. I literally said that no matter what, if she wants...if we want, we can make it and said that I will be by her side no matter what she decides. (even if there was a very high chance the baby was not mine)\n\nShe decided to give the pregnancy up and despite me not knowing if the baby was mine or not until today even, she treated me horribly until we parted ways in a huge fight, ending up me being humiliated and her hitting me repeatedly on my way out. I said \" Enugh! I am out!\" \n\nI probably ended up with a bit of trauma and a sense of insecurity from back then, but I am working it out...I am better now among many other things I have to deal with.\n\nPS: Later, I found out over the years, randomly, from different sources that she fucked a lot of guys during those night outs with the so called friends, all the time while she was giving me hell about being unfaithful to her (while I was making some pocket change towards the end of my degree) and as I was waiting all those nights for her, home.",

He was older than I was, had no idea he was a father to someone, but given his age and looks I could have assumed if I really thought about it. What really made me Nope about this guy is that he didn't seem to be fond of or used to rejection. Older than I am, but anytime I'd turn down a request to spend the night or come over or yada yada, he'd throw a full out tantrum. Saying I used to be more submissive and that's how he likes his women, to be more yielding to him. It didn't dawn on me until I was older that I dodged a bullet. I am a small and tiny woman. At twenty five I am barely one hundred pounds and not even average height. This guy is the body builder type. The guy that believes he is God's gift to women because he lives in a gym, easily pushing two hundred three hundred pounds of pure muscle. Towering six feet. He may have liked his women to be small because we would be 'weak' against him. Too afraid to say No to him. So glad I got out of that and I do fear for whoever he has ended up with if he hadn't changed. That is my favorite 'Hellllllll No' moment üòÅ",

He also didn't check how I was a single time throughout the next couple of weeks when I met up with my aunt and other cousins, saw the body, went to the funeral etc. He'd been pretty problematic before, but this was the point that I realised I had no energy left to give him.\n\nEdit: To be clear, we were living together at this point.

There were many red flags. One, he‚Äôs the kind of person who exaggerates a story more and more with each telling. Like, I would be there for the dramatic event. The first time he tells the story, it‚Äôs already a little bit different; the other party is a little bit more snide or aggressive, and he‚Äôs a little less so. By the third retelling he‚Äôs super patient, eloquent - a saint, even - and the other is an unreasonable jackass. If you make a mistake he tells everyone he knows about it (and of course something small becomes a huge error in his story) but if he makes a mistake he‚Äôs really self conscious about it and chews the head off of anyone who brings it up. He doesn‚Äôt read people well but he always assumes the worst about others and so he therefore assumes that they are thinking the worst of him, so he will get upset over a totally innocuous interaction. ‚ÄúWell she was clearly being rude! I saw the way she looked at me when she said that!‚Äù ‚ÄúActually she was being very polite and reasonable. They‚Äôre out of breadsticks, she‚Äôs not the Nread Warden, she‚Äôs a teenage girl. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not the first time it‚Äôs happened at an Olive Garden. Calm down.‚Äù\n\n\n\nWe met on a dating site (honestly more of a hookup site) and about six months in I noticed he was getting message notifications from that same dating site. Asked him about it, he says he still talks to friends on there, hasn‚Äôt met up with anyone else, he‚Äôs sorry, I can trust him, he loves me, etc. A couple of years later I come home from work and he‚Äôs left another hookup site up on our laptop, sitting right on the living room table. Like, for real my dude. Confronted him about it, pretty much same answer. He‚Äôs only chatted, hasn‚Äôt met or hooked up with anyone, hasn‚Äôt cheated on me, etc. We were weeks away from a major move to another state at that point, and, like an idiot, I took him at his word and we moved forward with our plans.\n\n\n\nA couple of years ago I hear from a coworker that he‚Äôs been seen on a couple of other dating sites, showed me screen caps, etc. Confronted him about it, have a five hour conversation, decide to try an open relationship with boundaries and rules because he clearly wants to be young and free but still keeps stating he wants to be in this relationship. That was just a bandaid, of course. The rules were you can‚Äôt see the same person twice because, in his words, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs when feelings develop.‚Äù So no FWB‚Äôs, etc. He had his freedom to play, and he definitely took advantage of it at first. I was uncomfortable at first but I told myself it was just sex, that our relationship was what mattered. And I‚Äôll admit, after some time  I kind of warmed up to the idea and I took advantage of it on three occasions. Of course the first time I did he flipped his shit because ‚Äúit was a bad day at work and I didn‚Äôt need you telling me you‚Äôre were going to be with some other guy!‚Äù I just let you know it was happening, I thought being open and honest was part of the rules? \n\n\n\nWell, after about a year and a half, things aren‚Äôt improving, and I hit my limit. Listening to how two-faced he is his stories versus what actually happened, his pettiness, his tantrums - I‚Äôd had enough. I sat him down and we had another long talk into the night - the breakup talk, ofc - and at the end of it he really wants to make it work. Against my better judgment, I relented and said okay. And things weren‚Äôt great but I felt they were improving. They were better than they had been for a long time, and it felt like that old spark was back.\n\n\n\nShould have trusted my gut, because then I found out about Steven and Curtis. Now, this is where things take a bizarre turn.\n\n\n\nI had just gotten myself a new gaming rig, so I let him use my old one and set it up to the living room TV. Well we play an MMO together, and I went to go download the update onto the old computer and noticed that he‚Äôd left his gmail up on one of the browser tabs. That‚Äôs normal and I don‚Äôt usually care, but on this particular occasion it was flashing ‚ÄúSteven Xxxx Says...‚Äù and I click on it to see that he‚Äôs got two conversations going on Google Hangouts. One with a Steven, one with a Curtis. Now, at first glance I can see that these are both scammers. Broken English, saying they‚Äôre American but using football for what we call soccer here in the states (yes, I know, we suck) and other huge, obvious flashing red flags. But my Ex doesn‚Äôt see the flags. In fact, at this point in going through his chats with his best friend and his mom because idgaf anymore, I‚Äôm over this shit. He‚Äôs been planning to break things off with me, he‚Äôs planning a life with ‚ÄúSteven‚Äù, doesn‚Äôt want me touching him, etc. I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúwow, really dude? After begging me to stay and telling me one thing, you‚Äôre telling a completely different story to your best friend and your mom.‚Äù \n\n\n\nBetween the two scammers, they scam him out of not only $100 in Steam cards, not only $200 in Google Playstore cards, but ANOTHER $500 in Google Playstore cards. $800 in one week! It was hilarious at first, because it‚Äôs what he deserved, but then it got sadder as time went by because my Ex was really getting emotionally invested in Steven in particular and was somehow blind to all of the scam signs.\n\n\n\nSo I break it off with him for good, and then he tried to say ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre only focusing on the negative things I said, and none of the good!‚Äù MF‚Äôr I have the transcripts, there was no good in there where I was concerned. ‚ÄúWell I don‚Äôt want to lose you from my life; I still want your friendship and to make memories with you.‚Äù I guess you should have thought about that before having cyber romances behind my back, and planning to break things off with me and leave me in the dust as soon as you and ‚ÄúSteven‚Äù have everything set to go, and telling your best friend - on our anniversary (which was April 30th so this is still pretty fresh for me - that you were planning to break up with me and that the gifts and dinner were too little too late. Nope. Get the $&@! out of here with that noise. Maybe before you had a shot at being friends before, but your true colors are too vivid for me to ever want you in my life.\n\n\n\nI‚Äôve known it was over for a long time, so it‚Äôs not as devastating as it could have been. I just stayed too long. Was really has me upset is that I‚Äôm 32 y.o., and 8 years is 25% of my life. I‚Äôve invested a quarter of my life and efforts into this man with no returns to show for it. So now I‚Äôm just taking it one day at a time and trying to claw my way up from slipping deeper into depression. I know it‚Äôs for the best and everything will work out but I just feel so unwanted and unworthy of anyone else right now.\n\n\n\nTL;DR - there were many ‚ÄúNopes‚Äù but my final ‚ÄúNope‚Äù was when my ex would have rather give $800 to internet scammers than be with me.",

She didn't tell me about this until the day after getting grounded, meaning we had zero contact for over 48 hours despite her having her phone while sleeping over at this dude's house. Due to being grounded she got her phone taken away, so we only chatted once every couple of days (a very drastic change from 2-3 times a day that we'd been doing). She still had her laptop, which had discord on it, but for some reason she didn't want to message me through discord. \n\nWe kept going for about two weeks through that (7-month relationship at that point) and a few days before the end she said that while she was grouded and had her phone taken away she didn't really think of me all that much while I on the other hand was worried out of my mind as the most stable part of my life for 7 months had suddenly disappeared. We had already being seeing each other very rarely due to her work schedule and both our school schedules and on top of all that, she came to a realization that she was asexual. I could have worked with that, but I needed at least some intimacy and affection (non-sexual of course; date nights, regular communication, etc. We had been texting each other good morning/good night and she had just stopped doing that).

When I walked in the room, she stood there on the bed and poured this pomegranate tea on the white down comforter on the bed while looking at me laughing. I took her down off the bed and told her to get dressed so I can bring her home. She got dressed, but hit me in the face, so I continued outside like I was going to the car to bring her home and when she got outside, I went back in and locked the door. I called the cops. She started hitting herself in the face and banging on the door. Luckily I live in a rural area, so I didn‚Äôt have any neighbors for her to wake up. The cops arrived and she was crying that I beat her up. I spoke to the cops and told them what happened. They noticed that she was intoxicated.

I would go to my male friend‚Äôs house to stream video games onto twitch as I did not have a gaming PC at this time, and he would think we were up to something. I worked with him and my male friend, but quit to go to school. One day my friend called in sick and he assumed I had been with him all night.\nHe also tried to track me through Pok√©mon Go. He would check when I caught my most recent Pok√©mon, and assume I was out catching Pok√©mon at night in the winter time. \nWhile I was in school, the building sits between two counties in my city. Sometimes your location reads one county, sometimes the other. I would catch a cool Pok√©mon and show him and it would say the other county and he‚Äôd accuse me of cheating as the other Pok√©mon I showed him said a different county. \nHe would go rogue for 16 hours sometimes. I would go to the gym, and he would claim he went by the gym and did not see my car there. He didn‚Äôt want me to go to the gym at a specific time because a guy I had a fling with would sometimes go during that time. One time we were at the gym, and the guy was there, and he ridiculed me after and claimed I was staring at him and stuff. Then he ridiculed me because he was looking at other women but claimed I was checking women out infront of him. He was extremely manipulative and insecure. \nIt was an absolute mess.",

We've been chatting on OKC for about a week, we get along well and he seems nice. But I don't like the city, especially at night. And parking is insanely expensive. I tell him that, and he makes up some dumb excuse about loving the lights or something and tells me he will pay for parking. I agree.\nI show up and this dude is way too well known at both bars we went to. Like, beyond regular status and not just by the staff. It's a little eerie. But I shrug it off. Maybe he's a popular guy.\n\nHe asks to take a picture of me. Not *with* me (not that it would've been much less creepy, honestly) but *of* me as soon as we sit down. He starts going on about how his friends would never believe he was with someone as hot as I am. Then he starts calling me \"the unicorn\" because I worked as a junior engineer, play video games, and love horror movies. It gets obnoxious fast. Like he doesn't use my name, just refers to me as \"Ms. Unicorn\".\n5 minutes in and he asks to kiss me. We haven't even gotten our drinks yet. I decline.\n\nHe introduces me around the bar, to everyone, as \"Ms. Unicorn\". I wonder if he has forgotten my name.\nHe asks to kiss me several more times. At one point, he goes to get more drinks. He comes back and presses weirdly close to me when he drops my drink off. Instead of setting it down in front of me like a normal human being, he kind of leans around me and presses up against me in a thinly veiled attempt to feel me up. I feel his erection against my leg. I am repulsed.\n\nI try repeatedly to end the night early. He has excuse after excuse. Waiting for someone who owes him money, wants to see the score on the game, blah blah blah. Eventually I shrug and say fine, and just leave.\n\nHe races out and catches up to me on the sidewalk to \"walk me to my car.\"\nWhen we get there, he gets in the passenger seat. I ask what in the actual fuck he thinks he's doing. He explains that he \"can't drive right now\" because \"reasons\" which certainly aren't getting his license suspended for a DUI. He tells me I need to drive him home since he \"didn't get what he paid for\". Stating that he meant the expensive parking, implying he meant me. I grimace, but whatever. I agree to drive him home.\n\nWhen it comes time to pay for parking, he does not have nearly enough cash and no card. I am forced to pay.\nHe lives almost a *fucking hour* away. He most definitely did not tell me that. Too late now.\nOn the ride home, he tells me he's \"in love with me\". Dude has spent a grand total of 2 hours with me, including the awkward car ride. I tell him he needs to stop. He insists. He says he \"just knows\" and that he can \"tell I have a beautiful soul\". I vomit in my mouth a bit, metaphorically speaking.\nEventually we arrive at his creepy, run down house. I pull into the driveway and tell him goodnight. He tries to kiss me. I push him away and tell him to get out of my car. He starts to cry. I repeat, get out of my car. He goes on a sobbing tirade about how \"his heart just gets in the way\" and he \"falls in love too soon.\" He proceeds to start punching himself - hard - in the chest and legs. I tell him again to get out. \nSuddenly the porch light pops on and an older woman comes out. He gasps \"sorry, I live with my mom. I didn't tell you in case you wanted to come in.\" Snot muffles his half assed apologies.\n\n\"Get out! Now!\" He starts begging me to \"give him a chance\".\nI roll down my window as his mother approaches. \"Please get him out of my car.\"\nShe opens the passenger door and tries to pull his arm. He swats her away, then slaps her hard.\n\"Come on, *name*, you can't be doing this to girls all the time. Come on inside now.\" She is undeterred by the slapping. He is still in my car.\n\n\"If you don't get out right the fuck now, I WILL call the police.\"\nThat seems to snap him out of it. Or maybe into it? He stops crying and lets his mother drag him from the car. I pull out at lightning speed and catch a glimpse of him running after my car in the red glow of tail lights.

So 3 years pass and we both decided to do a next step and start a relationship. A few weeks into it and she had an incredibly sudden change in her mood, like drastically, she just went completely from cheerful, optimistic girl to just purely depressed, I was obviously worried and tried to get her to talk with me about what happened, and if I could be any help to her, but she was adamant that we don't talk about it and if I keep insisting she would dump me, she basically told me to pretend everything is okay even though it wasn't. \n\nI was in quite a shock because not only we couldn't talk about that issue, we basically stopped any talking at all because she was depressed all the time and just couldn't say a word, it was such an abrupt change to how we used to interact with each other. Another week of such \"relationship\" passes by and I get a text from my ex's friend saying that she cheated on me with him and he felt really bad about it so he decided to confess. \n\nAs it turned out later it also happened exactly the day we decided to form a relationship with her. I couldn't bring myself to talk about that with my ex because I was just too confused and shocked by that, so I just wanted to leave and cut any contact with her. A week later that guy who texted me, sent me another message saying that my ex invited him a few days after I left, she was all happy and making jokes and shit and she told him how she actually hated me all that time. \n\nAll that happened 2 years ago and to this day I'm still extremely confused as to what fucking happened, so many questions unanswered and I just don't understand why we went through all of this.

We agreed to a second date, but after sleeping on it, I was too weirded out by over-the-top-ness in terms of him asserting his masculinity. So I decided to cancel the second date and he got *pissed*. Tried to guilt me hardcore like I owed him a second date and wasn‚Äôt allowed to change my mind. We never communicated after that, so nothing bad ever happened, but I can only imagine what life looks like with a guy like that a few dates (or years) down the road.

The call went on for ten minutes while I'm sitting there waiting for him to just effing be done so the wait staff could take our order.

I asked how long it would be and if I could just wait for him at his place, which he said he didn't know and sent me away. I was obviously annoyed, but went home.\n\nAfter another hour I get a call from him saying I should come back. I told him no. He said he had something really important to tell me and that I should come back. I said he should just tell me over the phone. He said he couldn't do that and that it was too important and needed to be said in person. After a little while (while smelling some bs) I did decide to drive back to hear what he had to say.\n\nSo I get there and asked him what he wanted to tell me. He said it wasn't important anymore and proceeded to act like normal. I felt manipulated by the whole thing, made to drive 4 hours altogether that day. Before I left I had already decided I was going to break up with him, but wanted an answer before I left. \"Were you actually going to tell me something or did you just say that to make me drive out here?\" He at first says it was to make me drive out there, but then says he was going to ask \"If we could have an open relationship. Not that I have anyone in mind, but if I did, it would be this close friend of mine.\" üôÑ\n\nYeah, that's a big NOPE from me. I officially broke it off with him and left. He then stalked me over social media and through text sporadically for the next two years. I never responded and would just block him, but he made several new accounts to keep reaching out to me saying weird stuff like, \"It's so crazy how the world works and how our paths seem like they're meant to be.\" He finally stopped after those two years though. We were only in a relationship for a month and a half. üëÄ",

He would tell me what to wear and what I could say, what I could and couldn‚Äôt do, where I could go. One day we went to a party at his new job (we were 16) and I was wearing a white crop top with a maxi skirt and some sandals and he made me wear his hoodie and put on his pants because I looked too good. Mind you he was 6‚Äô3 and I am 5 feet Wouldn‚Äôt even let me wear makeup because he said people would hit on me if I wore it. One time I was at the mall with my family and told him to meet me there and he started screaming at me in the middle of the mall when he got there because my pants were too tight and made me buy a sweater to put around my waist. \nThis sounds bad but the last straw was when we were 17 by now and we went to see a rock band play at a local bar. I went after school so I had my uniform polo and my uniform jeans. There were girls at this concert with tiny skirts, fishnets, collars and high heels. He made me put on my sweater and made me wear his hoodie around my waist. Obviously I got super hot and took it off which he got pissed at me for but the vibe was good so I just told him ‚Äústop I‚Äôm literally going to pass out‚Äù and he let it go as long as I just kept his hoodie around my waist. I‚Äôm built with a really small waist and a huge butt and it‚Äôs really not my issue. So we leave the concert and he tells me to put the hoodie back on and I said no dude everyone here is dressed super sultry I‚Äôm not going to feel bad for wearing my school uniform. He said people were only looking at me because of my butt size and all the other girls were skinny and flat so they didn‚Äôt have to cover up. I said well that‚Äôs their problem I‚Äôm hot im not putting a hoodie on and he said ‚Äúwell whatever I warned you.

During said deployment, I was informed of a miscarriage. I reacted poorly, but given the circumstances (being shot at, and mainly just emotionally numb because my every day was sweat, blood, and work) I wasn't even aware I had reacted badly. Then, I get the chance to call from the USO, and I find out there was at the very least a very thorough tonsil licking party with a female in her unit. I let it go, for the aforementioned reason that I'm basically a robot. Few weeks go by, and I get the chance to call again, and I find out that this time, it was a male, and it went much farther. I hang up, because it all.managed yo break through my emotional void. After a few days, the story changes. It wasn't consensual. I urge her to contact the police, talk to her unit, don't let him get away with it, and she says she'll try.\n\nI finally come home and I try to start dealing with tearing down that emotional void, but it turns out that void was hiding anger. A lot of anger. It caused a lot of fights, and by the end of each and every one, I'd end up a sputtering mess because she played her aces in the hole. My lack of reaction over the miscarriage (when I came home, it hit me full on what happened, and is still with me to this day. I'm not sure when it happened exactly, but I recently found out I am most likely sterile) but by then, it was too late. I was constantly reminded of that time, and nothing I said after ever made it better. Then, when I was low after she'd toss that one out, she'd throw out that I hadn't ever done anything when she had been raped. I remember asking her what I could have done more, and her reply was always that I could have just done more. \n\nIt was the final straw when she threw out the miscarriage during a fight and my shoulders just went slack and I sighed, looking down, only to suddenly be rocked by a full arm smack. My body responded before my mind was finished reeling. I grabbed her hand, but she just threw the other one at me, screaming about how that was not how I should react to that. I twisted her arm, and calmly told her she'd never touch me again. I let her go, and she ran and locked the bedroom door. After the cops got done, and with the thankfully timely aid of the neighbor, I left. She and I were separated at this time, due to her getting stationed somewhere else, and this all happened when I came out to see her, and found out she was boning a married dude, over a decade older than us, and I confronted her about it.\n\nTL;DR married too young in the military, and ignored the giant neon \"this is doomed\" sign, and ended up leaving after almost getting arrested for getting attacked.",

He would come and actually tuck me in, then phone to check I was in bed. I was 19 years old and I wasn‚Äôt down for that sort of control, so after a few weeks of complying and telling myself it‚Äôs just because he loves me ,I started to get up and go see friends etc. One night I was in the club, Saturday night, nothing odd and he comes in crying and stressed that I was having fun without him. I told him I was done, didn‚Äôt want to be owned by someone. Later that night at home in bed, I woke up and he was at the end of my bed on his knees praying, begging me to give him another chance. He been throwing stones at my window and woken my brother and convinced him to let him in. He was a mess. I can remember him walking away down the street whilst I peeked through the curtains, he was swaying and staggering a bit and I was convinced it was so I‚Äôd pity him and take him back. Fast forward a few weeks and I‚Äôd been out with friends and got home to find the front door open slightly. I walked in and without walking my parents checked my room and then my brothers, who is younger by a few years, he wasn‚Äôt there. I text him asking where he was and he tells me my x had come round and convinced him to go look for me. I was freaked out that he would go to these lengths, but my brother was starting to get super nervous as he‚Äôd driven up to some cliffs near where we lived and was threatening to drive off them. He had a history of behaviour like that, you leave me, I will kill myself was one of his go to lines! Mum and I had taken him to hospital a few times after he took an overdose and he had his stomach pumped! I managed to get him not to do anything crazy and said come back, we will talk. When he got back I was so upset that he had put my brother in that situation, we had more on the knees begging he‚Äôd change etc, but all I could see was a life of being controlled. I told him we would never be together. He tried to twist it, that it was my fault, as apparently if I‚Äôd just gone to bed when he asked, none of this would have happened. I also would have spent my late teenage years forward being controlled. I know I should have left him earlier, but he made me feel like his life, was in my hands and I was scared he would actually kill himself. He followed me round in his car for a while and would drive past my parents house, we looked into restraining orders, but didn‚Äôt pursue one, mainly because we didn‚Äôt want to ruin his life. Which is ironic, given he‚Äôd ruined mine for years!\nMove forward a few months and I see him out and he tells me his dad has just died. I said how sorry I was, I genuinely got on with them and his response was I left him at the wrong time because he‚Äôd inherited quite a bit of money.

He also has parental controls on my phone so he can see anything and everything i do, for example one time i was texting one of my now, ex boyfriends and he sent me a picture of his new haircut, and because he just got it done, his shirt was off, so he didn't get hair all over it, and i told him it looked nice. A few minutes later my father texts me \"why did your boyfriend send you a picture of him with his shirt off?\" and so i now know he can see the text messages that i send, so i had to passive aggressively tell him that he wasn't sending me a picture of him shirtless, but of his new haircut, and he still didn't believe me. He also yelled at me and my siblings a lot while we were growing up, (him and my mom broke up when i was three so he was the one who raised us basically) so now i have really bad panic attacks when people yell at me, or even raise their voices at me, So good job, dad! and the reason i brought up my pronouns is because my dad would also call gay men, and women f@ggots and Trans people Tr@nnies. so i am actually scared to tall him about my sexuality and gender identity, but my girlfriend is awesome and is helping me through it. ANOTHER THING, he also can control how long i'm on my phone for where my phone turns off when its 10:00pm and the only thing i can see is my lock screen, and i can only get into my phone if i have my dads email and password, which i don't have that info. he also wont let me get the Covid-19 vaccine, because he things ill grow another arm or something... and so now i have been ignoring him and his texts for 3 months now.

            "text": "There were plenty of things that piled up over 5-6 years that should have noped me right out sooner, but I was a 15-year-old girl during a time when Twilight was big who got all googly-eyed when he told me he loved me and wanted to spend his life with me. I was lonely, na√Øve and easily manipulated and he knew it. Nope flags like:\n\n* He was 11 years my senior. Meaning I was 15, he was 26.\n* The very next night after the \"relationship\" was official in our minds, he wanted to fondle me.\n* Claimed to be Christian, but had no problem sneaking into my bedroom at night to ask for a blow job on countless occasions. \n* Tried to pretend our \"relationship\" wasn't all about the physical stuff (which he asked for/forced every chance he got, and his pleasure was always the focus, not mine). He was very good at placating me with flowery words and lies about our blissful future together.\n* The fact that he demanded our relationship be kept secret. He forbade me from texting him when other people were in the room because he was afraid they might look over my shoulder and get wise to what was happening. (AKA call him out for being a child molester and throw his ass in jail.) We even created fake emails with fake names for instant messaging.\n* When our \"relationship\" went long distance, there were very few Skype sessions that didn't end with me pulling off my shirt so he could jerk off and then fall asleep. \n* He was wishy-washy as shit, constantly breaking things off with me because he had an attack of the conscience. But then, like clockwork, not even a week would go by and he'd beg for me (aka my body) back. And like a na√Øve little idiot, I fell for it every time.\n\nOne night while video chatting with him in my college dorm room after about 6 years of this, he pressured me to take my top off (like usual) and I refused (very unusual). He threw a temper tantrum a 2-year-old would be proud of. That, for whatever reason, was the beginning of the rift that finally caused me to cut him loose, which I had never done before.  I finally took off my na√Øve glasses and saw him for what he was: a lonely old pathetic loser of a man who could do no better in the relationship realm than take advantage of an inexperienced girl.\n\nThis guy screwed me up. Almost ten years later and I'm still working through this shit. I've placed an excessive amount of emphasis on my physical appearance in subsequent relationships, thinking very toxically that if I am no longer attractive to this person, they will leave me. If I reject enough sexual advances, they will leave me. He taught me that my worth was mostly in my body and how I used it. If I am not the perfect little submissive sextoy girlfriend, I will be disposed of like trash.\n\nThe good news is I *am* successfully working through all my garbage and have an amazing relationship with the love of my life, my husband of almost four years now. Through many painful conversations, he has helped me understand that attraction is complex and multifaceted, that yes my body is part of the equation but there are plenty of other more important things that he prioritizes for a mate and the future mother of our children. I have been pathologically terrified by the appearance of little wrinkles at the corners of my eyes. I have been terrified of getting old and having my body become less and less attractive (therefore decreasing my overall worth as a human female). I now know this fear is irrational. When my husband says he wants to grow old with me, he has no delusions that my 26-yo body will last until I die. This body that contains \"me\" is only a small piece of my existence that he loves. There is plenty of intangible stuff that is much more important in the long-term.\n\nI don't know where the molester is, nor what his life situation is, and I couldn't give the slightest flippity flip. It's taken a long time for me to be free of him. I hope when he stands before Old Testament God on judgment day that he falls on his knees in futility because he will receive no mercy.\n\nIf you've read this far, thanks for that. I encourage everyone to find someone they trust to talk through traumas. Journaling helps too. Be kind to yourself as you work through stuff. Peace and love to you all <3",

We were on the rocks after he did a bunch of cocaine at an out of town wedding we went to and accused me of flirting with his best friend from college. This all might have been fixable if we weren‚Äôt already in our 30s which is old enough to make better choices or if it hadn‚Äôt been the first time I was meeting any of his friends. So cut to.. I had had a really long shitty day at work because of work and I was also exhausted because a really close friend of mine was suicidal and in crisis and I was trying to talk her through it throughout the day. It was a full plate day to say the least. My boyfriend was supposed to meet me at my house when I got off work but I made it home 45 minutes later than usual. I live 3 minutes away from my job so I was just getting myself up to speed with everything I‚Äôd missed by the time I pulled into my driveway to see that he wasn‚Äôt home. Confused, I‚Äôm now seeing I had several calls, texts, and an angry voicemail explaining that I was so ridiculously unbelievably late that he was leaving. He left my house 15 minutes after I was scheduled to arrive home. He waited 15 minutes. He got that mad in only 15 minutes. He would have had to drive by my work to get to his own house and would have seen I was still stuck there. So now I‚Äôm pissed that he couldn‚Äôt manage to wait 15 minutes one night when his job required that I regularly wait or work around his incredibly loosely scheduled shifts all the time, and I‚Äôve already been put through a bunch of crap with this whole drug binge thing he likes to do that I hadn‚Äôt known about so I drive over to his house to end things face to face. When I go in and tell him the kind of day I‚Äôd had and how awful it was and then how awful it was to get home to this drama after I had been so looking forward to finally relaxing with my dude.. he smirked at me and said ‚Äúyou know, I had a really bad day too, I left my lunch pail at home.‚Äù I told him it was over and I left. It was honestly the lunch pail thing that really did it. I went back a couple days later with my dad to collect my extra furniture I‚Äôd let him use to furnish his big empty farmhouse and there were empty beer cans all over the main floor. It looked like the aftermath of a college frat party. 2 months later he texted me to bitch at me for ending things and I asked him what he had done to his foot as I saw him recently cast in a boot. Turns out he drunkenly slipped at his parent‚Äôs house and severed something in his leg on a broken glass and both his parents were too drunk to drive him to the emergency room so he almost bled out. He dated a girl for over a year after that but they broke up a couple months ago. He tried to connect with me on social media almost immediately after their breakup, as is his MO. ‚ÄúNo thanks but take care‚Äù is all I could muster.",

If this applies to you DNI because i don‚Äôt want to fight. \n\nThere was this boy that i knew in middle school, let‚Äôs call him Alex. He was always super fucking weird and constantly doing guilt trippy stuff to make you feel bad for him. One time I caught him playing games on the school device and, as the dumb little 6th grade tattle tail I was, I started teasing him about it. I wasn‚Äôt friends with him at the time, I would actually have considered him my enemy back then, but he was very lonely and liked to pretend that we were friends based off of the very few positive interactions that we had. Anyways, i was teasing him and he pulled up this drawing online that was one of those angsty tumblr drawings of a girl hanging herself with tons of words like ‚ÄúStupid‚Äù and ‚ÄúBitch‚Äù scribbled all around her. He said ‚ÄúThis is how i‚Äôm feeling right now.‚Äù And got super mopey. At the time i didn‚Äôt really know if this was his true feelings or not, and it may have been, but the way that he showed it off was just super odd. I tried my best to ignore him but he would always try and be friends with me. \n\nI kind of moved on in 7th grade and reconnected with a childhood friend, let‚Äôs call her Green. Green and I hung out a LOT and she was a lot more sympathetic than i was. She became friends with Alex even though i really disliked the pairing. We had other friends as well, who all generally liked Alex. Shit happens and a couple of friends move away, some stay, whatever. All the while Green and Alex were still close friends. I never really voiced my concerns about Alex with my other friends since I thought that I was just blowing his actions way out of proportion or something. He still showed signs of his manipulative guilt trippy behavior, but not a lot anymore since he was usually always given the attention that he wanted and positive feedback that he thrived on. 8th grade came and honestly? I kind of forgot about his whole guilt trippy behavior. My friend group was large and close and we all had a fun year. I tolerated and sort of began to enjoy his presence. Towards the very end of the year, however, his nature began to shine again since I was spending a lot of time with Green in anticipation of high school, where most of us would be split into different schools. I don‚Äôt think he liked being left out, so he would get all mopey and sad to try and get attention. We decided to stay in touch over discord and that‚Äôs where the shit show really began. \n\nI lived close to green so over the summer I would go to a spot and meet up with her so that we could hang out. Things were all cool and good until one day Green just added Alex to the Group chat. I instantly dmed her ‚ÄúListen, i know that you‚Äôre friends with alex, but i am REALLY uncomfortable around him and I don‚Äôt want you to expect me to be friends with him.‚Äù Green met this with annoyance saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not kicking him out.‚Äù I, again, just swallowed my feelings so that i didn‚Äôt have to deal with fights. His activity on the discord chat was very odd  and very creepy. Green, I, and a few other close friends made another chat specifically to talk about arguments that we had with Alex. We were very VERY passive aggressive to Alex as his true colors started to shine on the internet. \n\nIf Alex was efficient in one thing, it was avoidance. He would avoid us every time we tried to bring up his guilt trippy nature. He would say shit like ‚ÄúReal time talk over!‚Äù as if we could just go back to normal on his own whim. His activity online, especially sexual activity, made us all VERY uncomfortable. He would say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go jack off to some loli futa hentia porn‚Äù or other shit about lolis that just made us uncomfortable. Not in a joking way either, or at least we couldn‚Äôt tell that he was joking. He also did some super creepy stuff like sending a NSFW question chart to ask someone, but not himself, no you got to ask it about someone else and they had to answer. Shit like ‚ÄúHow big is your penis‚Äù that was one that he REALLY wanted someone to ask. When none of us wanted to ask the person in question any of those questions, he just asked them himself. This was not really shut down by the person in question, but also not consented to. \n\nHere comes the most important arc in the manga; transphobia. Around this time a lot of my friends were starting to question their gender identity and they started going by new names and pronouns. One of my friends, let‚Äôs call him Zack, was a transgender male. It was well known at this point that he was very uncomfortable about his dead name and did not want anyone to bring it up(that‚Äôs also just common decency.) But somehow alex ‚ÄúAccidentally‚Äù stumbled across Zack‚Äôs dead name. And instead of ignoring it he decided to make one of those ‚ÄòSacred text!‚Äô memes with ZACKS DEAD NAME as the punchline. Zack obviously got REALLY MAD and rightfully so. This was kinda the turning point in the friendship and now tue private group chat was blowing up. Shit was all starting to make sense to us. We all started listing off grievances such as him downplaying the abuse going on in one of my other friend‚Äôs homes by saying ‚ÄúAt least you don‚Äôt live in my house.‚Äù Shit he was doing on other servers, bringing up our past interactions with him, the whole works. From that point forward he had let a lot more transphobia slip, such as saying that trans women were still men until they had surgeries, using the incorrect pronouns purposefully and just crossing them out instead of deleting them such as ‚ÄúZack thinks that ~~she~~ he is so cool.‚Äù Etc. \n\nWe had given him many chances up until the breaking point and we confronted him many times about this behavior and he had either ignored it or shut it down with his patented guilt trip move. When we dropped him we had just confronted him with all of this shit and blocked him. So to be honest? I noped out of that friendship a very long time ago, it just took my friends a while to catch up with me.",

This instantly sounded like a scam to me, so I started doing a little research on how to deal with something like this.  Literally five seconds of googling brought me to a .gov page about these kinds of scams, with advice about how to figure out if you're a victim.  \n\nIt turns out that one way of finding out if the person who's \"interested\" in you is a fake persona is to do a reverse image search on them.  So I took \"her\" image of facebook and did a reverse image search, finding that the image on her facebook page was originally from an adult site, from a post years ago, attributed to someone with a completely different name.\n\nI told my brother, and he wasn't deep enough into the relationship with this fake girlfriend to the point where his emotions would beat out his reasoning.  He unfriended and blocked her the same day I told him.\n\nWhat really clinched his decision to block and unfriend \"her\" was that there was a friend of mine who I went to school with, who currently lives within walking distance of where my brother lives:  this friend of mine was also friends with \"her\" on facebook, and when I told him about my brother's story, he told me that this same fake-persona said the exact same things to him about wanting a relationship with someone around here.  He also unfriended and blocked her, and we reported her, too.\n\nMoral of the story:  vigilance and using your head can save not only your own bacon, but also that of your kith and kin!",

called under saved under my name so just look like I called and blamed me and left mind you I have to fear from in this world hospitals and horses that was on hospital visit one where I was diagnosed and told that I had such bad blood clots in my lungs they didn't know how I was still alive those Hospital trip one I'll give you the highlights the next 5 months I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure was going to kill me also had pneumonia weeping legs edema fell down all well living in the town she wanted to move to and then getting out of prison again I'll paper and everything starting a business she took it all depends on her name every time we had wouldn't give me money to even pay our own bills are brand new car I will show her how she lied and she would say I was tripping or something it was my fault so rewind back little bit we went on a road trip together so during covid-19 in a restaurant drove all the way to Utah from Colorado and she cried to me swore to me she would never do it again this wasn't the first time I worshipped the ground this woman walked on I became father to her three children one who was abused by her ex was leaving comfortable to be around men but the girls better not all the way with you will because years ago but she will be do the love everything that I showed her I wasn't perfect messy and I was one thing I guess and if this is wrong for saying it this way I mean I guess I'm wrong 99.9% of the fights we got into from my end was me asking her to love just me to honor just meet to be with just me to only want me stop lying to me tell me the truth and just be my wife all I wanted it I literally have text messages Rich Homie how much of a loser and piece of shit I am because during covid-19 unemployment in starting a business she's always an excuse for what she's done or has been played down I never cheated on her I was a dog before to my ex but I changed my ways I grew up and became a man and want to just my beautiful loving wife who I'm pretty sure his comment on this also in this thread I guess I don't know but 2018 after having a stroke due to stress and fighting with her after we got home from the hospital being punched in the head being told I was such a loser because instead of fighting and do anything that I you know my anger gets the best out of leave I'll go to think I would leave the perfect know that I use drugs so I think I need to kill the pain when I get to look at the woman I love her anything and she would just lie to me some pictures of her in the man in the phone it was nothing no big deal how's my Fall 2 horn prison I was a insecure piece of shit that she shouldn't even be with because I built it in my bones when we was up and she told me that I was insecure piece of shit because of that she should leave me for it and she had more up on me tell me the reason why I like going to prison when I went to prison to provide for my family ghettos molested as a child and liked in the ass Inwood Li perfect know what I put stuff out there on Facebook so I just wanted to see I know people said before about talking about people say all you leave now, so I try to kill myself I took a handful of pills one night she told me I was a liar about it she I mean it was just one thing after another but I'd love this woman with everything I had it she could do no wrong and I just wanted her and wanted her to do more and every time I would literally be doing the definition of insanity Pistorius would not make sense at all but I was trying to figure out how to put a round peg into a square hole okay open honest with about everything I talk to her about every decision we made we made together and I was still wrong I choose death loves from with everything I have she lied to me again yesterday she told me every time we talk she cries how much she loves me still wants her marriage but I guess you're talking to other dudes on her Facebook but I don't have Facebook if I was told about it home I've never been good enough for anybody my whole life especially with my wife probably just the best but I do just do it on message Holly just do fucking quit taking up a spot in the Earth if some of this doesn't make sense I'm a slow typer so I'm using voice to text the big thing that made me see anything was the people with the bipolar and BPD she would say that she would shoplift and cheat because of her mental illness that's what she did it for but my c-ptsd of years of peanut molested in beat and molested in b as a child and never trust the first time I ever felt safe in my life cuz she was my safe place first time ever that was cut that I wanted sympathy when your grandfather died I was there when am I 16 year old nephew shot himself and killed himself she told me was my fault was part of my agenda I love I had to move out of state and no longer live in Colorado what did I sit on the couch with a 5-4 500 lb of water weight I want my wife I want my wife back I want to finally be good enough there's a lot more but I definitely know about mental illness I know about dealing with it getting with a perfect know that I found flaws my folks did I screw up yeah I own that one her scent and I wish I could take it all back and change it cuz I still believe a woman's my soulmate but what's the point anymore right oh and I don't want him to think I want any type of fucking sympathy and anyway I don't want nothing like that going to be feel bad about me for a fucking thing through a couple of things in there I was wrong for feeding and doing what's right with the kids the last time I saw my son which is my stepson here and I mean cried and she told me what you got to let me in the house because there's another girl in there there's no curling there I was hugging my son everything's were when I first got out of prison I would make sure by the time she got off work cuz I wasn't working right away which I'm a piece of shit for after 10 years in prison you know it's hard to know and Sue's light but I I would have I'm not talkin a little like oh a pizza I mean I'm a cook I can cook I mean the kids do the dishes I've ever feet have sex with her all she wanted one time she asked me to make love to her I did I made it special and swear it was something so different than she's ever had in all I wanted was her living just me and that's all I wanted and myptsd comes into a lot because the lies and being lied to another truck doesn't like what I went through the kid and I'll let them push it like it was hard and I just I don't know I plowed all you do is I got out of toxic relationship all you women that mean they suck especially when you truly love the person you hold on with every little bit you have so I don't know I wanted nothing more than to make her happy but when I found a dating profile with what I had told her on it and she use it as a line for another guy and then I was able to call like a live chat on a dating profile and it was her talking shit to me as somebody else I would lie to me that she never had sex with but when I knew I saw it and when she told me the man who she she said raped her she was having phone sex with that show me red tag but not watch the scene and I didn't I didn't run I pushed everybody away in my family I just don't know that's why I feel like a doormat I was going to grab her and slap in the face and look what you did literally a week before Christmas she laid on the couch with me I haven't seen her all of November almost all of October as I'm laying there with my heart feeling

I liked him a lot but struggled with the fact that he didn't seem to want to hang out as much as I did. I was lucky if I saw him in person 1-2x a week.\n\nThen my brother suddenly passed away. The next two weeks were a flurry of funeral planning, dealing with the hordes of condolence wishers showing up at my parent's doorstep, dealing with my hysterical mom, and struggling through my own grief.\n\nI spent about 3 days with my bf in those two weeks and asked for him to support me at the funeral which all seemed fine. Then my immediate family and I booked a cabin and headed out of town for ten days to decompress and heal from all the madness. Everything seemed normal between us before I left.\n\nThe first evening I was gone, I sent him a text with a picture of the view from the cabin deck. He didn't reply until the next afternoon and gave me a 1-word response. I texted him some more and didn't hear back at all. I tried calling and he wouldn't answer. I gave up trying to reach him after a few days of no reply. So, in the 10 days I was supposed to be healing and decompressing from the most miserable couple weeks of my life... I was stressed out, hurt, and feeling completely abandoned by my bf.\n\nThe day after I got back from the trip, he finally called me back. He sounded chipper and happy as he told me \"that break was good for us, I really needed some space to recover.\" This was the first time I'd been notified we had been \"on a break.\"\n\nAny last remnants of feelings I had left for him dissolved immediately and I dumped him on the spot. He had the nerve to act surprised.\n\nFunny bonus: a few months later I ran into him on public transit as I was heading out on a girls night with a bunch of friends. I looked hot af and went over and said hi briefly, then rejoined the girls. One of them asked if he was my ex and I said yes. Some of the girls looked over at him and giggled. A few days later I got a long ass ranty email from him going on about how I needed to stay away from him because I was a horrible person, and how hurt he was that I had bullied him by apparently mocking him in front of my friends etc...\n\nBullet dodged.",

            "text": "/ tw self-harm ment\n\nI was 15 and got into a dedicated online relationship. We loved each other a ton but my internalized homophobia kept getting to me. I eventually got over it but I often would tell my partner I felt guilty that we were a same-sex couple, etc. they just said ‚Äúscrew that I love you!‚Äù \n\nAnyways, one day I was venting about my self harm and they asked ‚Äúwhen was the last time you did it?‚Äù And I replied ‚Äúlol I‚Äôm doing it right now‚Ä¶‚Äù so as you can imagine we both kinda freaked out. They said ‚Äúif you self harm I‚Äôll self harm!‚Äù (They knew stress was my main trigger so this was an abusive and c*nt move on their part)‚Äî anyways I began to self harm more to calm down, which then triggered me more because I was panicking more. They kept sending me stuff like ‚Äúgetting the blade now‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúputting it to my skin‚Ä¶.‚Äù Etc. Like that would stop me from self harming‚Ä¶ \n\nanyways, long story short, later that week I got seen by a doctor who told me I nearly cut an artery in my leg and had multiple cuts that needed stitches‚Äî and that I‚Äôd need to be sent to the hospital. Sitting in the hospital, talking to my partner I just remember thinking ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt even apologizing‚Ä¶ wow what a c*nt.‚Äù And basically made me question my entire relationship with them. That was the breaking point I think. I broke up with them that day, saying that not only they sent me to the hospital but that I couldn‚Äôt stand them having multiple other partners. \n\nThey recently found my vent post about them and their partners on Wattpad and got their partners to tell me to kms, that they wished I get marred genitalia from bottom surgery, that I was the abusive one in the relationship, etc. let me just say I‚Äôm so glad I left. \n\nMoral of the story: don‚Äôt date a polyamorus person if you‚Äôre not 100% sure about it, and don‚Äôt try to cure someone from self harm from threatening them.",

It was everything I wanted and more. For the first few months, everything was going great. For context, she's pansexual and polyamorous. I of course accepted her being poly and pan but I asked her to not add anyone into the relationship until I know where this relationship was going. Then a few days later I found out she was dating someone else online. At first, I was shocked, hurt, and devastated. I ignored that because I loved her so much and I didn't want to hurt her. I however went online and found the guy she was dating at the same time. I informed him how I was her boyfriend and we talked. We got along great and agreed to be in a poly relationship. I had explained everything to my girlfriend at the time and everything was good again. I had even started to become best friends with her other boyfriend. A few weeks later they broke up because he was super toxic. He started texting me asking to hook them back up. When I told him I couldn't he would fake his suicide/muder/death etc. Pretty much anything type of death you can think of he used against me. I eventually blocked him and ended any ties I had with him. My girlfriend and I ignored that it happened and everything was good for a bit. That was up until I found out she was dating at least six other people. I was yet again devastated. She had started to date six other people at least. It might've been more. She hadn't told me about any of these guys she was seeing. She was also pining over her ex and wanted to date three people in our communications class. I felt... stuck. I didn't was too scared to end things because we share a friend group. I didn't want to lose my friends to this. In the end, she broke up with me. She gave excuse after excuse. She didn't want to admit that she had cheated on me. She wanted me to take the blame for this whole thing. I blocked her account on a site we talked through after school. She moved away this summer and I haven't heard from her since. This relationship did more harm than good. I have since moved on and haven't dated anyone since.\n\nEdit: I think I also forgot to clarify one more thing. She'd also send me the same death threats saying she'd kill herself when I wouldn't feel sorry for her. She did this even after we broke up and this is what always made me feel like I was an awful person. I had stopped believing her after a few times when we were dating. She'd go to school with not a single cut or even scratch on her. She'd also refused to call me by my pronouns. I am a trans man and she would still consider me a woman. The only people at school who would support me was my now best friend. This whole ordeal was just really messy and I'm glad it's over.",
