Heffner concludes that if that bothers you, the inverse should also bother you. Sadly, he neglects to actually demonstrate why that is.\n\nYou and I can see that Heffner is correct, because we know that gay people do not cause harm.

It would be considered offensive and bad form if you decided today to write some alternate history of the antebellum South where Black people had all the power and owned white slaves, because you should be able to care about the actual people who were in the position of enslavement back then, who were Black. The implication that the reader is incapable of caring about Black characters would be insulting to absolutely everyone in this day and age. And if something like this short story were to be printed today, you'd be accused of having a more sinister motivation, like saying people shouldn't give LGBT people rights or attention because we'd just use them to enforce some kind of pro-gay fascist state and would be just as hateful as straight people have been to us. Which some people probably actually believe. (And which is the exact opposite of what we actually want. I mean, we'll make breeder jokes and say stuff like \"The life of the heterosexual is decadent and depraved!\" but we don't actually mean that. Personally, I want every straight person to have good, enthusiastically consensual sex and a loving, equal relationship. I mean, if I even think about what I want to \"happen\" to straight people at all, which I don't.)\n\nBut at the time, when this level of empathy didn't exist, this was certainly a very powerful and provocative work of art. And I'm just saying this to point out that I'm glad we've kind of moved on as a society and can approach readers with \"I *know* you can give people who are different from you your empathy and can learn about our actual experiences without them being framed as personally impacting people who resemble yourself.\"",

Most people, under the right circumstances and causes will have an encounter or a situation where they interact with either gender. Case in point, homosexual people who want children have and will perform a heterosexual act to do so. Also, there is IVF that is available to not only heterosexual couples but homosexual couples as well. \n\nThe thought that if homosexuality will stop producing children is an out and out ~~racist~~ bigoted lie.",

Besides promoting equality for gays, he promoted all clever people that were being oppressed by the mainstream media.\n\nHe would later have problematic interactions with feminism.

There's actually a little bit in there that's kind of offensive. I do think the author was trying to explore this subject from a place of empathy and understanding though. He just didn't always seem to have the language to do so.\n\nBut as a whole it's a really fun read and the sexual stuff is really just a subplot/background info to the main plot (Sub FTL alien battles and a war that lasts so long neither side remembers what we're fighting about. And each battle is so far apart because of interstellar distances that no fight is the same. We bring entirely new technologies to each battle on both sides.)\n\nProbably one of my favorite books.\n\nAlso don't hate me if I got the title wrong.

Given when the book was written, I'm not sure if it was trying to present the absurdity of homophobia, since I don't even know if that word existed in the 70's.      \nAny positive message the book was trying to convey is undercut by the main character almost date raping a doctor after getting her drunk.       \nI think the point of the book in general was how foreign America got for career veterans after they would return from war.     \nAlso the book sees female soldiers as a definite in the 90's.. but the ladies in the army are mostly for satisfying the male troops when off planet.. so there's *that*.      \nI guess my point is that there's the extreme opposite of that article out there too I guess.",
