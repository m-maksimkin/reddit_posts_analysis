Stable enough to be useable, but unstable enough that it can be split up easier. How do you separate the two? Modern day uses centrifuges, but lets go back to 1941, when they weren't really sure yet what the best thing to do would be...\n\nMost of the \"yellowcake\" Uranium oxide came from mines in the Congo, and it was delivered to Union Carbide in Buffalo New York (none of this info is classified). They converted it into Uranium hexafluoride gas for \"reasons\".\n\nIt either went to Oak Ridge Tennessee, or Hanford, Washington. Hydroelectric Dams had been built there during the depression to create jobs, and the local demand had not increased yet, so they had tons of excess electricity.\n\nSomeone figured that one way to separate the U-238 from the U-235 was to shoot it past a strong electromagnet. The slightly lighter variant would be deflected more than the heavier one, so they set up two collectors. Well, making a LOT of large powerful electromagnets was important to do quickly, but that takes a lot of copper wire.\n\nCartridge cases are made from brass, which is roughly 75% copper, and communication systems needed a lot of radios, which also take copper wire. Every tank, plane, and truck needed electric wire. So...someone realized that you could make wire out of silver.\n\nThe Roosevelt administration was already printing a LOT of paper money to pay for the sudden huge war effort, so...they called in all the silver dollars, and most people complied. The Treasury already had tons of the stuff, and they melted down the silver one-ounce coins and had it made into wire for the atomic program. \n\nThe silver dollars we have today from collectors have barely escaped, and very nice examples can be purchased for about $40 each.\n\n https://www.ebay.com/itm/124080419095",

One of the most amazing machinists/mechanics I ever met was a member of the church. \"I machined parts. They'd bring me a drawing, I'd tell them why we couldn't make it and then show them how we could.\" Another was a chemist/mathematician. The day after he graduated from college, the Army came and got him and sent him here after a quick stint at Officer's Training School. He told me that after the war ended, he was released from the Army and came to work the next day in a suit and tie. Worked there for the next 35-40 years. Some brilliant, brilliant people that were there.",
