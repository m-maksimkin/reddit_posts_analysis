It's bad for everyone and everything, the environment suffers, future profits suffer, communities suffer. Whereas once things get going, every X years a section is ready to be logged, which takes X years to complete and replant, and then by the end of that section it's time for the next. \n\nI'm surprised humanity hasn't created giant greenhouses to continually grow valuable woods like mahogany and redwood at a consistent and accelerated rate year round.

We were based in Oregon, and operated under the moniker of Red Cloud Thunder, and also Cascadia Forest Defenders. I was involved and lived in the forest (mostly) from 1998 to 2001. We focused on old growth timber sales on public land however, and aimed to occupy and eventually cancel the entire sale, not just save individual trees. The  main tree village at Fall Creek at one point had 6 treesits occupied full time, with many dozens of trees tied in and accessible to traversal without touching the ground. We also had numerous aerial occupied road blockades, fort like walls, and even a tunnel system designed to stop heavy equipment.\n\nWe grew in number so we started to target other egregious timber sales all over the Northwest. I met so many unforgettable people in those days, inspiring, intense, some brilliant, some total wingnuts. I saw a unit (timber sale term) dropped all around me in a sit we had that was solitary, after I hadn't seen another soul for ten days. I found one of the first Red Tree Vole nests and documented it at Fall Creek which eventually was the tactic that took it off the chopping block (we were stalling for a successful lawsuit which said they didn't do a proper environmental assessment). We endured some crazy weather, sometimes hostile locals, and federal and local investigation and outright siege at times, but we had a hell of a lot of fun too. I remember thinking as I sat a platform 150 ft up between two massive Douglas Firs named Grandma and Yggdrasil that I had to have one of the coolest living situations on the planet at the time. I spent time in newer, more spartan setups, but that treehouse was swanky! It had a small library, generally plenty of food, private \"bathroom\" area, and could sleep 6 comfortably.\n\nThere is so, so much I could say about this if anyone is interested. I thought of doing an AMA years ago but I lurk more than participate here on Reddit. Anyway, all my love and respect for all who fight and have fought in defense of Earth, life, and the wild.",

Once it started getting media attention, then when the story went national, we couldn't believe it. We just thought they were a bunch of hippies but they actually accomplished their goal. I remember her getting interviewed by time magazine or some publication like that, and she dropped his name in the interview. My teacher was so proud.\n\nThat teacher was a great guy. He taught me many life lessons that had nothing to do with his class. He taught me how to be open minded but skeptical at the same time. One day before class started he saw me talking to the prettiest girl in the school. We were friendly but she was way out of my league. He caught me in passing and then started talking to me about dating, and I'll never forget it - he told me if I was going to work up the nerve to ask a girl out, with the fear of being rejected and all that can come with it, that I might as well ask the baddest girl out there. I never forgot that. I did ask that girl out and that started a a crazy 3 year relationship that ended badly but I was thankful happened. From then on, I always shot my shot with the baddest girl no matter who she was with no fear. It paid off so many times and I'm lucky he put that into my head so early in my life, it's helped me go after not just women but everything else in my life and if more people got that lesson early, they could go so much farther than they think they can go in life. \n\nSorry for the long ramble but seeing the name \"julia butterfly\" just made me remember all this.",
