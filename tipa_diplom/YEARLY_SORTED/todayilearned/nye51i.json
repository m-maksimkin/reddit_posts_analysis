Some details: first, Cage came out and didn’t say a word before breaking into the reading of Telltale, which made it that much better. 2 the movies he picked were so damn weird… like, nobody could be more nick cage about choosing movies than him… of all his movies… Bangkok Dangerous? Army of One? Supposedly, He picked Joe because it was filmed in Austin, and he picked Bangkok because he was dating a Vietnamese girl at the time if I recall. Such a weird series of movies to watch. One thing I remember is that he sat through every minute of every movie and in between movies, he didn’t go hide, he just hung out talking to fans.\n\nAnother interesting thing about this festival, is that while it completely worships Cage, in between films it also totally acknowledges is eccentricities in ways, I’m not entirely sure he’s aware of… they do this through assembled compilations of his weirdness in clip segments, sometimes very much making fun of him, and he stayed for those which made it a bit awkward to laugh. \n\nAlso, the draughthouse is just the best moviegoing experience there there is. Big shout out to that venue. Awesome shakes and chips and queso and a super positive vibe of people who just love cinema.",

The professor rang up Roman and called him out. In lieu of a legal tit for tat, Roman offered to come guest lecture for the prof’s students on a set date.\n\nThe day for the lecture arrives and Roman calls up the prof only hours before the class. He’s not only not in town, but has been ‘kidnapped’ by some relatives for a spur of the moment trip to Italy. The prof pushes, Roman pleads, then Nic Cage grabs the phone and offers to come to school with Roman at a later date.\n\nThe later date arrives, and my friends and I head to our easy A for that freshman quarter, “Technothriller Films.” We discover the scheduled film for that day had been scratched and replaced with Face Off. During the boat chase, our prof (not the one whose film was ripped off) paused the movie on a close shot of a SUPER intense Cage, then Nic Cage walked out for a guest lecture, Q&A, and stayed for a meet and greet.",
