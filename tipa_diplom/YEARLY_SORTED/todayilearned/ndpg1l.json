And of course there was the terrible power outage last winter that threatened the lives of several children, especially premature infants that relied on heated incubators, because you had no regulation requiring the power companies to be prepared for climate fluctuations like other states have. The pattern of putting children at risk instead of regulating an industry is longstanding and well-established, but it has never made sense to me.\n\nWhy do Texans value a small increase in profits for the owners of corporations _more_ than you value the safety of your children and your neighbors’ children?",

So now they can be found liable and might have to (gasp) pay money. \n\nSO COINCIDENTALLY I’M SURE, within 72 hours they had contacted me to let me know our neighborhood had just so happened to come up on the list for replacement, and very speedily did they manage to come out and excavate the whole thing.

The connection had allowed gas to leak into the school, and since natural gas is invisible and is odorless, the leak was unnoticed. The sanding machine's switch is believed to have caused a spark that ignited the gas-air mixture. To reduce the damage of future leaks, the Texas Legislature began mandating within weeks of the explosion that thiols (mercaptans) be added to natural gas.[1] The strong odor of many thiols makes leaks quickly detectable. The practice quickly spread worldwide.",
