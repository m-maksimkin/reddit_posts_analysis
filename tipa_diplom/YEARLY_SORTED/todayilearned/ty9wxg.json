The half-shekel was approximately the same coin as the Denarius (the two were not exact matches as the shekel was nominally a measure of weight in silver, where the denarius was a more abstract economic unit).\n\nThe English coin that descended from the Roman denarius was the penny, again typically used as payment for a day's unskilled labor (at least in the 14th century).\n\nThe US coin that fit into that same slot was the quarter dollar in the colonial period, which was about the same as the english penny, though that rose to something more like $1 by the early 1800s.\n\nSometimes I wish we'd go back to that model. It would make a lot of sense and take some of the burden off of individuals to use credit cards if basic, unskilled labor was standardized on a single $100 coin with similar divisions of that coin as we have divisions of a dollar today.",

Will they revolt now?There's no meat or fish affordable to anyone. Now the vegetables, crops have failed two seasons in a row. Now the price of bread. We literally saw the average household food basket get down to bread only. Until bread was unaffordable. There was a super Catholic kid who used to get grumpy at how the clergy ans the king were treated. By the end of the week we went through the worst excess of the first days of the Revolution, bloodshed really. The teacher, in a bit of a cheeky way, asked the Catholic kid \"you ok? Shall we pause for a minute? It's a very violent reaction, but with what we saw the French people going through, what else could have they done really?\" The kid stood silent for a second. \" I don't know miss, if I was a family man back then I would have probably burned down Versailles five months earlier than that..\".",
