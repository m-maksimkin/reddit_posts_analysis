According to the article:\n\n> The 11-book series features female professionals such as a paleontologist, Egyptologist and marine biologist. Cohen‚Äôs first book in 1991, ‚ÄúYou Can Be a Woman Engineer,‚Äù traces her arc from a girl who had never heard of female engineers to a woman who led a team of engineers on the design for NASA‚Äôs Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n> ‚ÄúYou only think about things when you see people doing it. Most girls know now they can be lawyers‚Äù from TV shows like ‚ÄúAlly McBeal‚Äù and female lawyers in the news, Cohen said. ‚ÄúThey know that they can work in an emergency room ‚Äî they‚Äôve seen ‚ÄòER.‚Äô But I don‚Äôt recall that anyone has seen scientists on a large scale, except for a few paleontologists in ‚ÄòJurassic Park.‚Äô‚Äù\n\n> At NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, physicist Barbara Wilson, 50, said she never knew of any female scientists while growing up in the Midwest. At age 10, she started reading science fiction books for inspiration, but none of them featured women. In school, counselors dismissed the idea of her becoming a scientist, saying she should consider jobs that ‚Äúwomen are more likely to be good at.‚Äù Books like Cohen‚Äôs would have provided the validation she sought, said Wilson, JPL‚Äôs chief technologist.\n\n> ‚ÄúIt was really difficult psychologically and emotionally to be better than all the boys in math and science,‚Äù she said. ‚Äú[The books] really would have helped encourage my feeling good about myself, that this was the direction I wanted to go.

The man writing the article actually stated that Jack Black had been in at least 160 acting roles, but that his mother might almost be as impressive as him. Might. Almost.\n\nThe woman helped to design the program that most likely saved the Apollo 13 crew the next year. While she was in labor. She was an engineer and a scientist in the 60s. She was also a ballet dancer with the New York Metropolitan Opera Company, wrote children's books encouraging girls to seek careers in science and engineering, fought for better workplace environments and opportunities for women, raised four kids, including the much-loved Jack Black, and was an all around badass. More impressive indeed!",
