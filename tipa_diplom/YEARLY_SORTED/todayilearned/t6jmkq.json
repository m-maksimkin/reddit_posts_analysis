Forensic examiners visually compare the individual features observed in two examined samples, they do not measure The result of this comparison is a conclusion that is stated in words (nominal terms), not magnitudes (measurements).\n\nGet this - they think PCAST doesn't apply to the techniques they are defending because PCAST is attacking junk science, and what DoJ relies upon for convictions isn't science.

            "text": "Yup! 100% knew it. Also, ‘lie detectors’ are complete bullshit and the FBI have always known. \n\nThe literal inventor (well the main one, because there were several inventors of multiple components that make up the lie detector as a ‘machine’) knew from the beginning that it was a flawed system. It doesn’t detect ‘lies’. It just indicates moments when a person might show signs of anxiety etc. \n\nAnd the ‘idea’ is that if a person reacts with an anxiety indicator then that person must be lying! NO, that just means people get anxious and nervous for a billion variables. There’s no guaranteed way to determine, without a shadow of a doubt, that the reaction recorded is from ‘a lie’ or a normal physical reaction due to nerves or anything really. \n\nBeing anxious does not equate to being a liar. Your eye movements don’t indicate lying. Your sweat has no bearing on lies either. Heart rate, blood pressure, breath rate, electrical impulses or *whatever* other stupid measurement you think is definitive proof of a lie is a god damn lie in of itself. \n\nThey’ve known this but they’ve kept using it. Thankfully in many municipalities have accepted this and removed lie detectors from any law proceedings, however, there are still some dumb states and countries which do use it in a court of law. And it’s ridiculous. \n\nLike I said, the inventor regretted this invention and spent much of the remainder of his life trying to remove the concept from use. Unfortunately, it’s still being used and stupid films and TV shows keep using it in their storylines, which therefore continue to proliferate its ideal. Media is a powerful thing. People watch movies and they believe things seen and discussed in film can be possible. People are stupid after all, of course. \n\nWe need to collectively end this shit once and for all. We need to end it’s use by law enforcement and educate people to finally understand you can’t ‘detect’ lies. \n\nNo machine, no ‘indicators’ of a persons ‘tell’ is accurate enough to send them to prison. Sure, it’s fun to use these things in a game of Poker, but it’s nowhere near good enough to determine a persons life and future based upon it. To convict a person of a crime and send them to prison simply because they got a bit sweaty in a very intense interrogation. And furthermore, these ‘experts’ (mostly cops) who believe in them or think they’re walking lie detectors, themselves.  \n\nI find this to be most troubling. Cops with delusions of grandeur and on a power trip think they can detect whenever a person lies. These cops are the worst. As if to suggest that if eye movements are indicators of lying, is so stupid it’s almost unbelievable. I’m not looking at you because I have general anxiety, from life. Not because I’m lying to you in this moment. \n\nWho the heck still makes eye contact anymore, it’s 2022. All forms of human interaction are just weird games. We all hide behind our masks and getting used to it, it’s almost become like a security blanket of sorts. These are some rapidly changing times and I don’t think we’ll simply bounce back to ‘normal’ afterwards",

(Think it was GEDmatch)\n\nThen GEDmatch changed their policy to where law enforcement was no longer allowed to do that, users of the site would have to opt in to allow law enforcement searches of their profile. I was just wondering if other popular DNA sites did the same. Like if 23andme, Ancestry and those guys banned law enforcement as well and I’m just interested in whether or not solving crimes using those websites came to a halt or if it’s something that LE and the FBI still does.",

Not all at once, families who had a series of babies die suddenly. He'd argue that it couldn't be SIDS, the probability of one family having 3 or 4 babies die if SIDS was just too vanishingly remote.\n\nAsshole just doesn't understand statistics. Probability of later babies dying of SIDS is vastly greater it one baby dies of SIDS. Because SIDS isn't truly random, it's just the catch all for various undiagnosed and unknown genetic and developmental issues, undetected illnesses etc that end up killing babies. You cannot simply multiply probabilities that are not independent.\n\nApparently his idiotic \"a first year uni student should see through it\" argument worked though. Some women are still in prison due to cases like this.\n\nNote that if there was *other evidence* then sure a conviction might be warranted. But convicting based mainly on abuse if really bad stats to claim \"beyond reasonable doubt\" is infuriating.\n\nThere are still lots of people in prison due in part to idiotic pseudoscientitic woo like handwriting analysis, polygraph, etc. Matching of bullet to gun is extremely unreliable too. Hell, even fingerprint analysis is way shakier than major law enforcement agencies want to admit.\n\n... And don't get me started on stupid probability arguments made about DNA. Argh. If there is a 1 in 1 billion chance of a false match between two randomly selected individuals, that does NOT mean there is a 1 in 1 billion chance the blood you found on scene is a false match for the dude you found in a database search of 50 million people. Sigh. Finding a DNA database match is a good start but you then need to have some actual evidence. Or at least test the blood from scene against the suspect's on some other markers than the standard microsatellite suite - if it *still* matches then you can be pretty sure it's a real match.",
