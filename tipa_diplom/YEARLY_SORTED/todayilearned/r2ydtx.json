So when a cat killed a mouse, if it brought the mouse to the people, they would reward the cat with milk or cream or something.\n\nOver time, the cats that were more comfortable around humans and brought the dead mice like that, ended up being the ones that became domesticated.\n\nSo after many generations, the cats that ended up living with humans, are exactly the ones that would present dead mice to them.",

She was just a run of the mill grey medium sized cat with the darker grey stripes we've all seen 100s of.\n\nShe laid around a lot like cats do and I wouldn't say she was overly attached to any of us but she was our house cat and that was good enough for her.\n\nWe had went into town one evening and got back right before dark...walked up to the front door & unlocked it and started in. \n\nOut of the corner of my eye I saw something fly through the doorway & into our still dark living room. I hurried & turned some lights on and started looking for the intruder .\n\nIt was a bat...it had flown straight through to the kitchen. Our cat Cheerio was downstairs..at least I thought she was. The wife and I chased this vermin  around the house for over an hour when it finally made its way downstairs.\n\nIn the time that we had our cat she never showed the slightest interest in catching any critters around our home. Birds, squirrels, chipmunks, field mice, nothing really.\n\nWe knew the bat had gone downstairs so I closed the staircase door and stepped out for a smoke. When I came back in my wife was grinning and I asked her \"what's up?\"\n\nShe said \"look downstairs\". Sure enough there was Cheerio at the bottom of the stairs with the bat firmly in her mouth with its wings pinned by her paws to the floor.\n\nI tried to take it from her but she refused to give it up...growling and running away. After several attempts I decided to let her out with it. She stayed out by our back patio for an hour or two then came back in without it.\n\nI don't know if she ate the thing or if it flew away...we never saw any traces of it after. She lived to be 19 and passed away on her birthday.",

It is important to give them wet food every day just for this reason. You should not see your cat drink more than once or twice a day, If they drink frequently, they need to see a vet.

After a while two cats became one cat (RIP Dynamite), and after some time, she actually wanted a new cat companion for our remaining cat.\n\nWell, the area we lived in at the time had a number of strays and stuff, most wouldn't approach us. One day, a little black cat (younger, maybe a year old? Maybe a bit older), approached our door, my SO opened the door and he walked in like he owned the place.\n\nSo, new cat. My SO's other cats were already pretty well behaved when we moved in together, so this would be my first experience with an untrained cat.\n\nWe did all the things and I was kinda braced for this little boy to be rightly terrible until we taught him some rules.\n\nI could not have been more wrong.\n\nWe set out some litter for him to use, he did. Apart from a few accidents (mainly related to him not being fixed and marking his territory), he has never been trained, nor required any training to know what the litter box is, or what it's for. Apart from some picky eating choices, food and water has never been a problem. And when he was finally cleaned up, de-flea'd and had his shots, we introduced him to our existing cat (they don't really get along, but mainly stay out of each other's way), and after that, he's been perfect.\n\nHe walked in off the street, with all the knowledge and skills I would expect from a house pet. Zero training.\n\nHe's been our fluffy buddy since.\n\nAdopt, don't shop. And in the case of cats, they will adopt you, you just have to let them find you.\n\nTL:DR; cat walks into my home and life from the streets, requires no training, and is a perfect domestic house cat.",

            "text": "Truth. There was once a cat that made herself at home in my neighbor's barn. Our dogs (who had grown up with cats) liked to visit the barn every now and then to find horse hoof shavings to chew on. She noticed their coming and goings and realized food could be found at our place if she ran out of mice to eat. Weeks later, and she had us trained to feed her the same time as our other pets, but she was adamant about being an outside cat until it became far too cold for her to be outside. Even after a taste of the good life, she would still demand to be outside as much as possible. One time she yowled to get my parents' attention and show off the plump mole she had caught. Thinking she was trying to give it to them as a gift, dad went to pick it up to release it later (since it was still alive). She immediately snatched it back up with a growl and proceeded to eat it in front of them. It didn't matter that she was given food earlier in the day. You can give a cat everything they could possibly want and need, but only they can choose if they want to be domesticated. When she got fairly old, one day after letting her out, she never came back. We assume she wanted to die in private.",

If it wasn't open she'd sit there making a racket until we let her in.\n\nIt went on like this for quite some time. We noticed that she was often spending pretty much all her time at our house so we decided to feed her since she obviously wasn't eating elsewhere and she was looking pretty thin.\n\nGradually this turned into her basically living at our house all the time. We decided to take her to the vet and see if they knew anything. She was microchipped and had an owner, but hadn't been to the vets for a couple of years. So we paid for her jabs and a checkup, overall she was in pretty good health though.\n\nShe continued to live with us and about a year or so later we did track down her original owner. It turned out that she'd gone missing several years previously, and the owner had 'assumed she was dead'. Fortunately for us, the previous owner had no interest in taking her back and agreed we could formally adopt her.\n\nSo yeah... Essentially our cat ran away from her previous home and decided she was going to come and live with us instead ü§£ You could say that she used us for food and shelter, but we like to see it a different way.
