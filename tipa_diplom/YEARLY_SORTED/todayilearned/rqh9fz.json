Trust that the restaurant knows what it's doing, and don't modify shit. Especially don't try to modify it to the point where you're creating your own dish. We hate taking these orders, cooks hate making these orders. \n\n-Your jokes are never funny. We also can't tell the difference between genuinely mean people and people who are joking, because we get plenty of both. Don't joke around, let's stay focused and move the process along. \n\n-Don't mumble your order, and be clear and specific about what you want, because when we bring you your food, and something is wrong with it, you're gonna blame us, and it's gonna suck for you and us if we have to remake it, when this could have been avoided by simply speaking up! \n\n-Sometimes people can't help things, but they're still annoying: the dumb looks on people's faces, the shit eating grins for no reason, the way they just stare at us sometimes (do you need something, or are you just staring?)\n\n-If we're walking near you, we move fast. Be aware of us, get the fuck out of the way, or speed up, especially if we render you the right of way, don't just continue waddling at the speed of a turtle. Get. The fuck. Out of the way, you slow, fat dummies. \n\nAnd the whole thing is we're not allowed to express our frustration with 99% of this stuff because it goes against the idea of hospitality. If we could express our frustration every time a customer annoyed us, we would all be soup nazis.",

I used to go there long before he became famous/infamous when I was picking up Film Dailies or Negatives when I was a Production Assistant. The guy was never unfriendly nor friendly. He just seemed to stare at customers and then move them along like a conveyor-belt. And yes, sometimes you got an apple or bread or whatever and sometimes you didn't. I remember asking for bread once and he didn't seem fazed but he just kind of made you feel uncomfortable. It was a typical NYC lunch place pick-up counter, know what you want BEFORE your turn and don't dawdle. Always have a \"back-up\" choice in case he ran out of your first choice. I also worked with Seinfeld on a few Amex Commercials BEFORE the Soup Nazi episodes. I am CONVINCED that the Soup Nazi was partially based on an infamous Caterer who was widely known and never shy about verbally abusing Crew members AND especially actors. He was half hilarious and half cringe-worthy. He was fired off a couple of jobs for offending the Ad Agency folks. I witnessed him tell Seinfeld and Carol Liefer that they were idiots for suggesting he make a waffle out of breakfast cereal. \"Why not?\" asked Jerry, the answer was, \"Because it's stupid\". Both Seinfeld and Liefer laughed uproariously at his insults and expletives. He also once told the Knicks Coach Pat Riley that basketball was not a real sport. He also made Emmitt Smith sign an autograph for a friend before he'd get breakfast. (This was after the Crew was asked NOT to ask for autographs). These celebs took it with good humor but the dude was 95% serious and had no patience with celebs or the \"Above the Line\" types.",

No door to enter where inside there is the counter he stands behind. And when he has lines he needs people to move past the window to the left once they’ve ordered so he can serve the next customer which is completely understandable.\n\nEverybody always got the bread and the chocolate, it was standard. I once asked him for his business card, and he just smiled and shook his head ruefully and said “No”. He was a nice guy who took pride in his food and his business.\n\nHe never wanted to be famous for anything but his food, certainly for nothing with nazi,  and he was constantly being harassed by people quoting Seinfeld and trying to provoke him into saying no soup for you.\n\nSo because of the people harassing him, he closed it down sold his likeness and recipes, and moved out of America.\n\nWhen the chain re-opened his original location I went there. Not the same soup.\n\nFor something like 15 years his 57th St. location was empty dots inside you could see some kitchenware, and outside in the upper right behind the closed glass doors and metal store front what is the sine asking people to step to the left.\n\nFor years every chance I could get I walked by there, because I wanted that little 8 1/2 x 11 piece of white paper.\n\nThen one day the gate was open! But instead of just taking the piece of paper, and also some of the plastic that’s in kitchen where I stepped in to see the trap door to the basement was open and I asked if anyone was there and I heard back will be right there.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes Al and another guy who was probably a realtor came up from the basement and he kind of angrily said to me “I’m not him “.  Which was not true it was obviously him.  And I got sent away.\n\nand then the front was closed again.but months later it was open again and I was not going to miss my chance and I reached up and I started attaching that now kind of stiff and brittle paper with the instructions to move to your left from up in the corner in front of his store trying to be careful.  And a workmen passed me by and entered the store.  Almost immediately the man who I imagine was in charge of renovations came out grabbed the paper that I had almost freed and then was going to run away with from my hands and told me to go away.\n\nI returned a few minutes later and offered him $20 bucks for it which just made him more furious.\n\nI left.
