This would normally result in around $200 to $300 for a band of their stature. After a couple of shows together, he began to have a strong following in Nashville and Nationally, so the last couple appearances his agent and I would agree on a guarenteed payout (no matter how many people showed up). The last guarentee was $1,000. The show I put together (as the promoter I did all the promotion locally, found other bands, local & touring to complete the card, or lineup, etc). At $7 a ticket and over 400 showing up for the show, I easily covered Pokey's guarentee. But, the show could have flopped (In Nashville there are a hundred options a night for live music) and no matter what, he would get his $1,000.\n\nI once jokingly inquired about LCD Soundsystem for a 2 hour show. This was around 2009 I believe. Their agent said $35,000 guarenteed with half up front. I decided to stick to small outlaw country bands. 🥲",

Admittedly, I went to see this movie for Devito not Schwarzenegger. It should **not** have worked. All credit due to the writers and to Ivan Reitman for having Arnie not \"try\" to be funny, because it all fell into place, and it changed the way we all looked at Schwarzenegger as an actor.",

Deals of this sort were not uncommon in those days when launching a film where it wasn’t sure it would make its investment back. Batman was a huge hit but before it’s release it was in serious doubt thanks to the remnants of the 60’s Batman in the zeitgeist and the casting of Michael Keaton who at the time was mainly a comedic actor.",
