I tried it, once, it was dangerous).\n\nThis was right in front of our fire pit, and close to the dock. Beaver and human conflict was inevitable with this location. So, I was instructed to remove this newly built beaver house. Which I did. It was amazing to see the inside, it was quite large, he/she/them were also using our old dock as part of their structure. \n\nI dutifully removed it all, and never had any encounter with the beaver(s) when doing so, so it all seemed rather straightforward. Only to learn today by Maine law maybe I broke the law. OR, maybe this could be described as a \"nuisance beaver\" and not quite as illegal. \n\nI need a forest lawyer.\n\nCODA: This spring this old dock was mysteriously gone as well.

A well defined trail. But it's in the middle of nowhere, it starts from nothing. Very odd. I follow it down the hill, and am further puzzled as there are trees and branches over the trail that I have to step over/around, but the trail is still clear as day.\n\nOnce I reached the bottom (and the Beaver Wasteland), I figured it out. It was a beaver trail, where they went up the hill to get trees they wanted, then dragged them down this trail. To a canal system, also clear as day, that led up stream to the giant beaver dam mentioned previously.\n\nSo they had built a trail and a deep flooded channel in order to cut down, drag from the forest, and float upstream logs to add to their dam. It was an amazingly big operation and opened my eyes to the scale of their efforts out there in the deep forest.",

            "text": "\nDear Mr. (Bureaucrat),\n \nYour certified letter dated 12/17/04 has been handed to me to respond to. I am the legal landowner but not the Contractor. A couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of constructing and maintaining two wood \"debris\" dams across the outlet stream of my Spring Pond.\n \nWhile I did not pay for, authorize, nor supervise their dam project, I think they would be highly offended that you call their skillful use of natures building materials \"debris.\"\n \n\n \nI would like to challenge your department to attempt to emulate their dam project any time and/or any place you choose. I believe I can safely state there is no way you could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity, their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic.\n \nAs to your request, I do not think the beavers are aware that they must first fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity.\n \nMy first dam question to you is:\n(1) Are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers or\n(2) Do you require all beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam request?\n \nIf you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, through the Freedom of Information Act, I request completed copies of all those other applicable beaver dam permits that have been issued.\n \nPerhaps we will see if there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994 being 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, annotated.\n \nI have several concerns. My first concern is, aren't the beavers entitled to legal representation?\n \nThe Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute and are unable to pay for said representation, so the State will have to provide them with a dam lawyer. The Department's dam concern that either one or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event causing flooding is proof that this is a natural occurrence, which the Department is required to protect.\n \n\n \nIn other words, we should leave the Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than harassing them and calling their dam names. If you want the stream \"restored\" to a dam free-flow condition please contact the beavers, but if you are going to arrest them, they obviously did not pay any attention to your dam letter... they being unable to read English.\n \nIn my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green and water flows downstream.\n \nThey have more dam rights than I do to live and enjoy Spring Pond. If the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection lives up to its name, it should protect the natural resources (Beavers) and the environment (Beavers' Dams).\n \nSo, as far as the beavers and I are concerned, this dam case can be referred for more elevated enforcement action right now. Why wait until 1/31/2005? The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then and there will be no way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them.\n \nIn conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention a real environmental quality (health) problem in the area. It is the bears!\n \nBears are actually defecating in our woods. I definitely believe you should be prosecuting the defecating bears and leave the beavers alone. If you are going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step! (The bears are not careful where they dump!)\n \nBeing unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office.\n \nThank You,\nMr. (---) & The Dam Beavers",
