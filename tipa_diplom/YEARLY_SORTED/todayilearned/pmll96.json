It's why have so many visible emotions displaying weakness, and why we have mirror neurons to literally feel that same weakness of others. These are the instincts our ancient ancestors had to keep society intact, why a dominant male fought rivals into submission, not to death, so to speak, and even though we have moved far beyond the instinctive basis of society, that's still in us.\n\nSomething like 9/11, where the disaster happened fast, where the visuals were confusing and desperate, triggers all those emotions - even for non-Americans with no personal connection to the situation. Those instincts force you to act, to do \"something\". For a trained professional, it's to put those rehearsed contingency plans in place. For those not trained, I think we all know the reactions - phoning a friend to turn on the TV, locking up unable to respond, desperately trying to find some way to be connected and take some action. It's why so many of us can vividly remember the exact moment we first saw the news, even though the reality is that 9/11 had very little direct connection to most people in the world. It was a social phenomenon, not just a tragedy.\n\nSadly, this same psychology is why we don't respond to \"slow\" tragedy's that arguably affect far more people than 9/11. Covid, genocides, wars, etc. We aren't primed for attrition as a social instinct, it doesn't trigger us unless some smaller element of those tragedies links to us more directly. \n\nMy hope, is that the remembrance of 9/11 helps people to reflect on how they respond to future disasters, particularly those affecting others. 9/11 was a \"freebie\" in the sense that it triggered the empathy in most of us without us needing to make a conscious effort to try to relate to the affected Americans. We all became \"humans\" on that day. We need to remember to be humans more often now.",

Yet they saw no one.\n\nMeanwhile, in Los Angeles, at UCLA i recalled we were asked to have our pagers on for the following 2 weeks and to be ready to head in if needed in case LA was targeted.  (The plane that crashed into the South Tower was bound for LA.) It was a surreal morning as I was just heading into the VA hospital and one of the vets - who regularly smoked outside - rolled his wheelchair up to me and exclaimed \"A plane just crashed in to the WTC!\" He was occasionally unhinged from reality and initially I thought it was not true. All day, vets and staff  were clustered around the few public TVs in the building. \n\n(In DC, my brother was taking the Metro to work. They stopped right before the Pentagon station and evacuated everyone.  Between him having to find another way to get home and the phone lines being tied in DC, we couldn't reach him until the next morning. He had walked to a friends house nearby and spent the night there. )",
