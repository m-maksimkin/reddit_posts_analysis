But their high standard of living is because they have enormous oil reserves, which they sold and invested in successful stocks, and then redistributed over only 5 million people.\n\nSimilarly, countries like the UK killed millions of people and stole a ton of wealth from places like India. Then they invested it in the country for several hundred years. Then they redistributed it over 66 million people (compared to the 1.36 billion people in India who they stole the wealth from in the first place). I mentioned India as an example, but many other colonized, enslaved, and genocided people around the world are in the same boat. It's no wonder that [Jamaica requested reparations last week.](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/jamaica-plans-seek-reparations-britain-over-slavery-2021-07-12/)\n\nUltimately, there is a weird level of selfishness in Norway which uses enormous oil wealth to fund free healthcare for 5 million people, or the UK, which uses the proceeds of slavery and genocide to fund the NHS for the people of Britain. It's especially the case because there are massive restrictions on immigration so no one else can share in that pot. And to directly criticize most people on Reddit, it's why people in the richest country in the world (the US) demand a $15 minimum wage, when earning $15 an hour puts in you in the top 1% of humanity. Even though most American corporations make most of their revenue from foreign countries, Americans want to tax and redistribute their wealth exclusively to Americans while ignoring everyone else in the world. 50% of humanity lives on less than $3.25 a day. 10% of humans can't even afford a toilet. They have to poop in the street or fields. If you really care about building a better world, you'd tax yourself and billionaires and give to the billions of humans who are far poorer than you due to the violence of your ancestors (whose wealth you inherited), instead of taxing billionaires and giving to yourself.\n\nEdit: The figures I listed are already adjusted for cost of living. So 50% of humans live on the equivalent of $3.25/day in the US.",

They told Big Oil to suck eggs and that if they wanted *any* of the revenue, they'd have to stump up the cash and take like ten percent otherwise Norway would just nationalise the fields, borrow the money and keep the *entirety* of the oil proceeds themselves.

Thus, Norway doesn't pay interest on debt because they have no debt.  And it doesn't actually pay for anything in specific.  Although they also have a separate and much smaller fund specifically to pay all govt. employee pensions.\n\nI found an article in Fortune magazine that explains how Norway planned to withdraw $37B USD from its fund - four times more than ever before - to pay for govt. expenditures and reduced revenue due to Covid.\n\nBear in mind that the population of Norway is only 5.3 million people.  So a sovereign fund of over $1.3T makes each and every citizen worth nearly a quarter million USD.  Revenue is highly volatile, so it's very hard to pin down how much the govt. has to spend per citizen from year to year.  Suffice to say, the record withdrawal last year represented almost $7000 USD per citizen without adding a dime to their taxes or deficit.\n\nFor perspective, in order for the USA to have a similar amount per citizen and an equivalent withdraw last year, it would need a sovereign wealth fund worth nearly $81T USD, with a withdrawal of $2.3T dollars.  The economy of the entire planet is only about $94T USD, according to google.",
