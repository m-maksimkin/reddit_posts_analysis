He lived there for 7 years, alone, living off a diet of seals, fish, and other sea life. I believe it was determined that he left his pack and traveled over 25 miles before swimming to the island\n\nIn 2019 or 2020 he finally decided to leave the island and swam to the mainland of Vancouver Island, where he was captured and relocated to a more appropriate environment up island. \n\nI was always fascinated by him and his story, and I truly regret not taking a trip around Discovery Island via boat in the hopes of seeing him while he was there. Sadly, he was shot and killed by a hunter where he was relocated in 2020, which is just bullshit. \n\nFor anyone interested in this one wolf and his story, it really is quite interesting. [Heres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICiuHibGgr8) a good documentary about him, and the woman who spent her time trying to document him and tell his story.\n\nEdit: His [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takaya_\\(wolf\\)) also has some interesting information about how he survived on the island.",

Bear in mind this hypothesis is largely discredited due to lack of imperial evidence, but it’s something fun to think about regardless. \n\nAlister Hardy, and later Elaine Morgan, both had trouble accepting the idea that humans evolved on land for 100% of human history. We have many characteristics (hairlessness, webbed fingers, bipedalism, fat below the skin) that we share with other aquatic mammals. I believe Morgan also noticed that humans that give birth in water have significantly lowered stress (for both parent and baby), as well as better overall outcomes. \n\nNone of this is proof like I said, but they are interesting thoughts :)",
