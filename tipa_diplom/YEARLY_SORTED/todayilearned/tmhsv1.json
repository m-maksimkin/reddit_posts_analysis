            "text": "That’s disingenuous as fuck. Whether the disease causes depression or whether a person is *naturally sad* because they’ve been told they’re dying in the most excruciating, slow and torturous death where you first lose your dignity before everything else switches off. Of course you’re going to be upset, depressed even. \n\nIt’s got nothing to do with ‘dopamine levels’. \n\nI just had my new oncologist accuse me of having depression a few weeks ago. The bitch doesn’t know me from a bar of soap. I’ve only just seen her because I needed a new oncologist to approve some scans for another health issue I have. We barely talked. \n\nI told her No, I’m not clinically depressed, I’m offended you would suggest I am without any proper accreditation or any assessment done. Of course I’m sad, yes I filled out your form and answered questions such as ‘does your condition affect your sleep, does it affect your daily life, does it affect your ability to socialise’. \n\nYeah, no shit. Doc. I got stage 4 cancer and it’s making my life difficult and I’m in constant pain. Yes, I’m sad there’s no cure and that since I was diagnosed I’m afraid of dying which will probably happen soon. *It doesn’t mean I’m depressed, you dumb cunt* being sad is normal. \n\nHaving your life deeply affected by the pains of cancer is not depression. Some sadness is okay. It’s natural. \n\nIdentically to Mr. Williams’ case, regardless of what they found with his dopamine levels. It’s rude to assume things and paint a person you don’t know, with anecdotal stories of third hand accounts what he was like in person and looking at some blood tests. You don’t know him. None of you know what he went through. \n\nThere’s always been a lot of people who claimed he had depression. Perhaps there’s even instances of him openly talking about it. But was that *before or after* he had his diagnosis and the burdens of his disease began to alter the quality of his life. \n\nWhich caused what first. \n\nWhen I first got diagnosed in 2011 I was still physically capable, was still working full-time being an active member of society and the pain and side effects of my disease were minimal. But as the disease progressed and I couldn’t do physical things anymore, work or see my friends and family. Yes, THAT’S what made me sad. My quality of life plummeted. That’s not depression, that’s being sad about unavoidable circumstances in your life. \n\nThere wasn’t some chemical imbalance that suddenly ‘you’re depressed now, mate’. No, anybody else would feel the same ‘sadness’ if they were in the same chronic pain and all the fun things they do in life are taken from them. Being told by a doctor ‘you will die soon in X years’ is natural to feel sad. Not depression. \n\nNow don’t misinterpret what I’m saying; I’m not hating on people with legitimate depression. That’s a serious disease and it’s very important that you get that treated and I hope all the best for anyone like that. \n\nBut there’s an *enormous* difference between being reasonably sad or upset at your circumstance in life (facing your own mortality in the prime of your life! I was diagnosed at 26 and told I would die soon!) and the difference of actual real *clinical* depression. Not just some kid at school with a bit of anxiety (we all have) feeling sad that the girl he’s got a crush on dumped him. Sorry but that’s not depression; that’s called being a teenager and anxiety is a normal human trait. \n\nBeing sad sometimes is normal. Dealing with a significant trauma event in your life and having difficulties with it, is normal. It’s not always ‘YOURE DEPRESSED!’ \n\nThank you. Goodbye.",

No one really cares if you don't seek help and so many people are in healthcare neglect in this country..  we need healthcare we need funding, most importantly we need brain disease to be treated like any other physical ailment.  \n\nPeople are slaves in this country to their jobs and to our culture of \"work harder and good things will come to you..\". We simply see health as another means of exploits pushed onto the poor..\n\nNothing will change fundamentally, until we all get Healthcare.  \n\nDoctors are only seeing those that can afford treatment.. when they should be seeing everyone.",

Then she forgot her grandchildren (myself and my cousins). Then, she forgot her own children. Then, her husband of 40 years who passed over a decade ago. Then, finally, she forgot her oldest friend and her brothers. Unlike Alzheimer's, at least in her case, there were no \"aha\" moments or \"good\" days. Once the memory was gone, it was gone forever. I didn't get to see her for about three years before her death because seeing someone she was *supposed* to remember, but couldn't, would have greatly distressed her. So I stayed away so that she would stay happily ignorant to all she'd lost.\n\nEvery little thing about her life, even reality itself, was removed from her.

Combine that with the fact he thought his wife(caregiver) was an imposter made it even more difficult. He ended up escaping from his assisted living and went missing for over 24 hours. Ended up being found in someone’s yard on a cold November morning after a night of rain wearing only a T-shirt and shorts. He made it through that ordeal, but I believe it accelerated his decline even more. After passing, his brain was donated to research. They also found CTE so there is belief that is also a contributing factor in LBD.

How am I supposed to if the funniest man alive couldn’t?” I felt… hopeless. And I’m sure many people felt the same way. The month following his death suicide rates went up 10%.\n\nBut in reality he was diagnosed with Parkinsons and autopsy showed signs of LBD. But this misinformation about Robin Williams continues and, to me, its actually quite harmful, at least in my experience, because I still see people… like… romanticizing his death? I  still see edits and videos going around (especially on tiktok) about Robin Williams and depression, like this narrative of “Robin went to therapy for years and tried different medications and rehab and it still didn’t work. There is no cure for depression, check in on your depressed friends 😥😢😢”. And people comment really depressing things on these videos or posts and it just makes me so… angry. Upset. Heartbroken for these people.    \n\nSo many people looked up to him as a source of joy and laughter in their life and now people are looking up to him as “if he couldn’t recover, how can I?” Robin Williams wouldn’t have wanted this. He wouldn’t want people to look up to him and succumb to their mental illness because he “did”. He was suffering from a brain disease. Not depression. And although his diagnosis could have made him “depressed”, along with his brain deteriorating, is that clinical depression, or is that a normal reaction to knowing you have a horrible disease and will be in horrible pain and wont be able to move your body in a year?\n\nPlease, if you see any of these posts romanticizing Robin William’s suicide/depression, please correct them. This issue goes so much deeper and he would’t want people to think if him in that way. There is help. There is hope. Therapy and medications can work for sone people. There are many other celebrities to look up to in regard to handling depression and mental illnesses. But he is not one of them.",

As a woman who was always very self sufficient, to need this much help in itself is a  physiological challenge. She cant work a phone anymore, cant make a meal, can’t remember to take her medicine. To have limited dopamine means that there is no reward system in the body for anything. To do a task, if she can even manage, doesn’t make her feel good after, she just feels relief its finished.

People who get this disease typically survive about 5 to 7 years after they are diagnosed. \n\n(next is a copy/pasta from a website, sorry if it is incorrect) The symptoms of this disease are :\n\n- Visual hallucinations. Hallucinations — seeing things that aren't there — might be one of the first symptoms, and they often recur. People with Lewy body dementia might hallucinate shapes, animals or people. Sound (auditory), smell (olfactory) or touch (tactile) hallucinations are possible.\n\n- Movement disorders. Signs of Parkinson's disease (parkinsonian signs), such as slowed movement, rigid muscles, tremor or a shuffling walk can occur. This can lead to falling.\n\n- Poor regulation of body functions (autonomic nervous system). Blood pressure, pulse, sweating and the digestive process are regulated by a part of the nervous system that is often affected by Lewy body dementia. This can result in sudden drops in blood pressure upon standing (orthostatic hypotension), dizziness, falls, loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence) and bowel issues such as constipation.\n\n- Cognitive problems. You might have thinking (cognitive) problems similar to those of Alzheimer's disease, such as confusion, poor attention, visual-spatial problems and memory loss.\n\n- Sleep difficulties. You might have rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, which can cause you to physically act out your dreams while you're asleep. This might involve behavior such as punching, kicking, yelling and screaming while sleeping.\n\n- Fluctuating attention. Episodes of drowsiness, long periods of staring into space, long naps during the day or disorganized speech are possible.\n\n- Depression. You might develop depression.\n\n- Apathy. You might lose motivation.",

My grandmother faithfully watched over him in the hospital for days until the family and doctor decided it was hopeless.

Just a couple years later, the guy she married was diagnosed with colon cancer and kidney failure. She took care of him like a nurse. Washed him, fed him, did everything for him. She was small, but a very strong woman. In the end, he died in hospice when she just couldn’t handle him anymore.   \nMy grandmother then thought she could have a good life again, free from troubles, hanging with the great-grandkids, living well. It wasn’t meant to be.   \n\n\nWithin weeks of her second husband dying, she was diagnosed with extensive cancer. She died in hospice shortly after. That was very, very painful to watch.

No one knew why. Well, after her sudden death from cancer, it became apparent. Once she wasn’t there to cover for him, Dad’s dementia was out in full force. I mean delusions and hallucinations where he saw his dead wife floating through the ceiling air vents and walls, coming home from “heaven school” with a younger guy in a black Lexus. He would go into the driveway with a bat. He’d lie on the floor at night with cans of food by the door in case he fell asleep, to catch her coming in. After 60 years of faithful marriage. He started driving crazily, so we got the keys away and moved him to a facility. When in assisted living then memory care, he went from suicidal (verbal, no tries) to violent, hitting staff who were trying to help him. He was 6 feet tall and stronger than the young girl carers. Twice they had us take him to a neuropsych hospital in another state to get meds figured out. It was like a cuckoo’s nest place, just scary and bizarre.  It didn’t help for long. His life was a horrible existence.. he was so sad, no joy. His care was probably near $7K/month at the end. He’d saved money his whole life, and needed it for that. \n\nMy kids and husband know I wouldn’t want to live like that. They know how I’d like to go. I know of a woman who used a service called Final Exit to end her life because she was terminal and suffering.\n\nTo people who have family members with dementia, I feel your pain.
