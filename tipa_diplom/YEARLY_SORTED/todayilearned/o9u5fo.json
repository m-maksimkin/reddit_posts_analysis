I make a joke,  no one's made it, it makes sense,  it adds to the conversation. If you don't like it it's a don't upvote situation at best,  downvoters can just go fuck yourself, seriously I've enough negative reinforcement in my life without needing to hate myself more because I try to make someone laugh. Assholes.\nDownvote all you want,  I have a count of now many people here would happily bully a suicidal person. People like you should first look at what downvotes are meant to be used for,  and 2nd stop acting like bullies cos karma will get you, it's not a nice thing to ruin someone's day. You're not going to make me kill myself today but when the guy like you does, I will remember people like you.",
