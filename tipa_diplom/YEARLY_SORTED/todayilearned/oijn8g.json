So, you can say his adminstration was ineffective in the face of major obstacles.\n\nHowever, the work that he has done since then in monitoring elections in burgeoning democracies and with habitat for humanity and on and on has made him without a doubt the most successful former president in history. He used his clout to benefit humanity and (not insignificantly) has shown what it means to live up to Christian ideals of kindness, compassion, and moral actions. (And this is coming from an atheist - if people _must_ be Christians the world would be a better place if they were his kinda Christians.)",

By 1980, road signs all over the country were dual listed in miles and kilometers. For two years, I was versed in the metric system in school.\n\nI’m convinced that if he had won re-election in 1980, the US would be fully on the metric system today, saving the entire world a sh\\*t-ton of headaches.\n\nIn addition, go look up the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980 (which Reagan immediately dismantled just months after taking office) for another example of Carter’s compassion and forward-thinking.\n\nHe was the anti-Nixon in so many ways. At the time we needed it, though it also came with the perception that because he was compassionate, he was also “weak”. As the decades have now shown, nothing could have been further from the truth.",
