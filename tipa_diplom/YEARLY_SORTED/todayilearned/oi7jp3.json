I did actually find some correlation that less seatbelt laws resulted in fewer accidents, which I think was because people drive a little bit safer when there’s more risk. I thought I would find more useful information but I think all I found out was that click it or ticket laws are bullshit and used to make money for police departments.

If 47% were killed while not wearing a seatbelt, then 53% were killed whilst wearing one. It’s either or.\n\nThis breaks the argument by misrepresenting the data and uses a logical fallacy to get there.\n\nEDIT2: so after I looked at the article, it quotes data from two different years:\n>Of the 22,215 passenger vehicle occupants killed in 2019, 47% were not wearing seat belts.\n\n>Seat belts saved an estimated 14,955 lives and could have saved an additional 2,549 people if they had been wearing seat belts, in 2017 alone.\n\nIf we ignore the years the data source from, then 47% of 22,215 is 10,441. If the 2,549 had been wearing a seat belt, the fatalities would have been 7,892, a 24.5% reduction.\n\nSo IMHO, a better title would have been “TIL 9.7% of Americans still don’t wear seat belts while driving. Roughly 1 in 4 fatalities could have been prevented had they done so.”",

Stats taken from my paramedic classes, googling it provided me with a range of stats, where 3 times as likely was the \"lowest\" estimate, some estimating 25 times as likely)\n\nLets assume a frontal crash. Your car hits/gets hit by something. Your body carries a lot of energy and inertia. The car stops, your body doesn't. It travels forwards, hits the seatbelt, which absorbs the energy and transfers it into the car. Sure, it might break a bone or two, make your chest bruise a bit. The forces involved may break your legs.\n\nNow assume there is no seatbelt. All that energy propels your body forwards. Your head impacts the glass (which is dual-layered with special glue between the sheets so it doesn't break as easily and doesn't produce sharp splinters). Both the glass and your cranium shatter. For the glass, it's the end. Your body flies further, hits whatever is in front on you. Your already-fractured skull and body hits the concrete. Your brain becomes smoothie in its cup, bones shatter.

            "text": "Because this is what I do for a living (investigate serious injury/fatal motor vehicle collisions) I'll give you some real time stats from my county (United States).\n\nSo far this year, we have had 17 collisions which resulted in 18 fatalities.\n\n4 of those victims were on motorcycles, one of which wasn't wearing a helmet.\n\n5 were wearing their seatbelts, but still died. \n\n2 suffered  medical emergencies while driving and died (were not killed by trauma).\n\n1 was a pedestrian\n\n6 were not wearing seatbelts. \n\nRoughly half involved drugs and/or alcohol (toxicology results still pending for several cases)\n\nSomething that needs to be understood, is that the safest place to be when you are involved in a crash, is inside your vehicle. Car manufacturers spend millions if not billions of dollars designing, testing, and implementing ways to keep their customers alive. Cars are designed to crush during an impact, which extends the time it takes for your body to go from the speed you were driving to zero. It isn't the speed that kills you, it's the sudden stop, so anything that can slow you down will lessen your injuries.\n\nAbsolutely, there are times that you could be driving the safest vehicle possible and doing everything right, and still be killed in a collision. Normally, something like this is due to direct intrusion into the passenger area (like a t-bone), or there was too much speed involved that seatbelts, airbags, and crush couldn't negate enough. This is why things like speed limits exist. \n\nOn average, all it takes to nearly guarantee death is a change in velocity of around 35mph (meaning your body suddenly either gained an additional 35mph in another direction or stopped going 35mph in a certain direction. Typically what we see at those speeds when we do an autopsy is a transected aorta, and commonly some level of head trauma.\n\nI have definitely seen cases where a person was ejected from their vehicle and survived, but I, as well as my coworkers, have never seen a case where someone was trapped by their seatbelt and killed. It isn't that common for cars to drive into bodies of water (normally we have things like guardrails or concrete barriers near bodies of water to avoid that), and even if you did drive off the road into a lake or river, just unbuckle your seatbelt. I have seen cases where people were stuck inside their vehicle due to severe intrusion, but it wasn't the seatbelt pinning them.\n\nIf you have loved ones who refuse to wear one for any of the above reasons, please shame them into compliance. \n\nFinally, you won't care about this if you're dead, but remember that others, usually a lot of others, are going to have to pull your lifeless body from your car and try to explain to your loved ones how you died. It's not fun for anyone involved.\n\nTl;dr - Just wear your seatbelt, please. And wear it the right way (talking to you, ladies). Please stress this to your kids. I understand they can be total assholes in the car and don't want to stay buckled or want to lay down, move around, ect, but the guilt you will carry with you if they get hurt really sucks.",

The driver side steer tire dug in and then pulled the bumper into the ground. Thus the rolling started.  \n \n\nIt rolled bumper to bumper 19 times.

He got ripped so hard out of his seatbelt, it literally de pants him. His seat belt was still clipped in and his jeans were on the floor. The driver seat was even in the correct seating position.

My entire life has been convincing him to wear his damn seatbelt. He grew up on a farm and \"the work truck then didn't have 'em, so why do I need one now?\" Um, because we're barreling down the interstate going 65 and if we get into an accident the momentum will make sure you keep going? He'll begrudgingly put it on when I or my mother asks him too, complain that it's uncomfortable, then just go back to not wearing it the next time he's in the car. He uses the fact that he hasn't been in an accident as proof that it's not a big deal, which I'm pretty sure is the definition of Survivorship bias.
