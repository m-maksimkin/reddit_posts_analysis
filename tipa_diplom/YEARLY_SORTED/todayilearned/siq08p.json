Harker's adventures in Transylvania were described in an extended Part I, in the journal format known from Dracula, while Part II, set in Hungary, Transylvania, Whitby and London, read like a sketch-like cauda, with only 9,100 words. New characters had been added, such as a mute and deaf housekeeper woman, two detectives (Barrington and Tellet), a dark-eyed Countess Ida Varkony, Prince Koromezzo, the ravenous Mme. Saint-Amand, the hunchback violinist Giuseppe Leonardi, Lucy's uncle Morton and Arthur's sister Mary. Harker's host was named \"Count Drakulitz,\" who engaged in financing and organizing an international conspiracy aiming at overthrowing Western democracy, and vented Social-Darwinist ideas; he also acted as the high priest of a clan of ape-like followers, sacrificing half-nude girls during gruesome rituals in a secret temple underneath the castle. All in all, the Icelandic text showed to be less sentimental and more to the point than Dracula, with a heightened erotic stance.\n\nMore characters. More eroticism.",

From [Smithsonian Magazine](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/icelandic-translation-dracula-actually-different-book-180963346/):\n\n>“The nature of the changes has led de Roos to argue that they could not have been the work of Valdimar alone,” according to Iceland Magazine. “Instead he has speculated that Valdimar and Stoker must have collaborated in some way. Stoker could, for example, have sent Valdimar an older version of his story.”  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Like any good Gothic story, though, the mystery doesn’t end there. Makt Myrkanna was originally published in serial form in an Icelandic newspaper in 1901. Many scholars, including de Roos, believed it was one of the first translations and serializations of Stoker’s 1897 novel. But recent publicity surrounding the Icelandic text, which was published in translation only a month ago, prompted a Swedish scholar to reveal that   \nthere was an 1899 Swedish translation of the book, according to the Iceland Monitor.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The new version, which scholars think was the version that Powers of Darkness was based on, means there’s more digging still to do before the true history of Dracula is revealed. ",
