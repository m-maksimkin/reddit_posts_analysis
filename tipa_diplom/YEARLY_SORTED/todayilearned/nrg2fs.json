All there people wanted to go visit the island so he got insanely busy. He found out all these people were Disney employees and execs. They told him they were filming a puffin movie since there is a huge colony of puffins on the island.\n\nOnce filming started they brought in helicopters and film crews and tons of equipment. They asked him to sign an NDA and eventually revealed the island would be a location in the Star Wars films. He ended up spending a couple seasons ferrying around movie crews, equipment and actors to the island.\n\nSince the filming of the movies he said that tourism in the area was up like 40%!",
