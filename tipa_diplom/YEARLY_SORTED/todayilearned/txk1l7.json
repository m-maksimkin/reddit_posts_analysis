Just a for instance. \n\nGovernment doesn’t like being cheap, they get boxed into it sometimes. Other times, there’s too much money free floating, to the point where those agencies don’t know what to do with it. They aren’t allowed to send it other places, nor can they keep it as a reserve (like in a savings account of sorts). What they don’t use will ‘go on record’ as not being necessary next fiscal year. \n\nThis causes spending to occur ahead of the game IN CASE they need it next year and don’t have it (A military example; things like runway repair or resurfacing budgets take forever to pass because they’re expensive, as one imagines and the allocations are planned way in advance for one-time use on a case-by case more or less petitioned by the section in need. However, if there’s an equipment deficit one year and the funding for it gets allocated for the current year, it’s in your sections interest to keep that money on hand by spending it to keep it in your budget. If you need new training equipment and that falls under the allocation the money is designated for, and you have a training surge where they all need new equipment, it’s nice to have that, isn’t it?).\n\nIRS is the same way, but with a much smaller budget compared to the military. Changing out the mainframe is like a runway. New chairs are like… rather, are equipment.

I guess, it's old in comparison to the majority of programming landscape today, but really... programming is more like math, where things once written don't get old unless proved wrong. Of course, that's an exaggeration... but the point I'm trying to make is completely different.\n\nThe article paints an ominous picture of the programming landscape today and how corporate is treating programmers. And, frankly, this is a lot worse than having outdated software... So, the point the article makes with an example: they tried to automatically port the code to Java, but it would create Java that's not like modern Java, so \"nobody\" would understand it.\n\nWell, here's the problem with this: it's not surprising that Java was chosen as a translation target, as it's still one of the most popular languages in the world. But... programming languages aren't like natural languages, where you may have a dialect you don't understand, or professional slang etc. Programming languages are formal systems. Derived from a very small set of rules. Once you know those rules, *you know the language*. So... what's the problem? What are they afraid of?\n\nIt turns out that there are two things at play. Most programmers who write they know Java on their resume lie. It's not exclusive to Java. This is the state of any modern computer technology. Most people advertising themselves as specialists have only a passing knowledge of it. And, because this is the overwhelming majority, the trend becomes contagious.\n\nBut, this attitude didn't grow all by itself. Corporate sector was pushing towards a world where programmers would become as replaceable and as easily trained as possible. This is why Java existed in the first place. And that's why any language that followed in its footsteps tried even harder to replicate its \"success\". Programming industry, by and large, chose to optimize for quantity over quality. The same corporate desire to see profits as soon as possible, to expand as soon as possible created a programming trend to make things dumb rather than creating better trained specialists. (In medicine, for example, it's mostly the opposite).\n\n---\n\nThe Assembly code used by IRS was written by plain mortals, same mortals that are around today. If anything, we should've expected that present day programmers would look at this code the same way how a radiologist today may look at the X-ray reading from the 50's -- with a smirk on her face, thinking how poorly trained those people in the 50's were. Instead, we have armies of so poorly trained Java programmers, that if faced with the code from the 50's, they'd jump out the window in panic.",

            "text": "> But the nature of assembler is that each line does a lot. \n\nHah, no. The exact opposite of this. One line of assembler almost always corresponds 1:1 with 1 instruction of the processor. One instruction on the processor is a very tiny amount of work, like \"load the number 7 into this memory address\" or \"add this number to the accumulator register.\" Instructions are generally designed to do the smallest amount of usable work so they can be _assembled_ into routines. They're like LEGO bricks, individually they're simple but are expected to be combined into more complex things.\n\nA high level language like C (high level compared to assembler, at least) can compile to as little as 1 instruction, or as many as tens or hundreds of instructions. 200,000 lines of assembly is not a lot. It really isn't. This is roughly equivalent to maybe 50,000 lines of C? 100,000 at the absolute most.\n\nOne argument they're making is that not many programmers know this particular machine anymore. So what? Learn it. Programmers have to learn weird, esoteric shit all the time. Shit, I learned PDP-11 assembly _for fun_, out of idle curiosity. I realize minicomputer architectures can be strange, but it won't be hard to get someone up to speed to reverse engineer this thing. Though I doubt any reverse engineering will be necessary, this was made in the era where fully documented printouts of source code were expected when you contracted for such a program to be written.\n\nThough I do not envy the programmer that has to untangle this code. It won't be a simple process. Assembly language, especially written in that era, doesn't follow any conventions of flow control that are recognizable to a programmer today. If you're familiar with programming at all, imagine programming with no loops of any kind, the only thing you can really use are if statements and goto. If you're really unlucky then routines have multiple entry points, meaning someone can jump to the middle of a routine. If you're _really_ unlucky, it uses self-modifying code where the code modifies itself on the fly, which was necessary for performance reasons on many older systems. The advent of structured programming made digesting code at a glance a given, but this isn't so with assembly, especially of that era. Each routine will have to be analyzed carefully, recreated in a modern language and tested thoroughly. But even given that this doesn't sound like a particularly difficult thing to replace.

We stumbled upon some old training screens which were last updated over 30 years ago, before I was born. Looking back on it, the system was stable and reliable, provided you know what you’re doing. Compare that to my experience at a “cutting edge” green tech company that I work for now, where they’ve built from scratch and scrapped 5 different systems in the last 7 years, each worse than the last. Some software director sells a grand vision for a new system which will fix all the problems with the old, it gets partially built and pushed to production too fast, they declare victory and walk away/leave the company/get fired, and everyone is stuck picking up the pieces. It becomes a massive pain for the business, and the cycle repeats itself. Give me the stable mainframe system again any day, over this mess I’m forced to use now.",

Java code in floating-point will start to truncate and compound errors with each iteration of, say, interest calculation. An easy example is to imagine you could only store 6 digits and wanted to calculate the interest rate for an account worth $1 billion that gained $3 in a second. You truncate at the 1000's place, so you get $1,000,000,000 - $1,000,000,000 and the answer is zero percent. You add another digit of floating point precision, then another, and keep getting the same answer, so you assume it's correct. The correct answer is about 10%/year. Trying to find all of these issues in Java when COBOL does it natively is a nightmare and a major cost.\n\nEdit: Math error ($3/second, not minute)",

They're running them because they're running ancient code designed for the mainframe in the late '90s or early 2000s, when they were close to the only game in town.  Because they haven't been willing to pay to modernize it so that they can interact with directly using modern tools.\n  \nAnd that creates compounding risk.

Sure it takes off and lands funny with it's bicycle wheels, training wheels and need for a chase car, but because of retrofitting when new more reliable and advanced technology comes along, it's still bloody good at what it does\n\nNowadays drones can do a lot of this stuff, but they still can't match the altitudes of the dragon lady. There is still a need, it's still useful but it would be bloody expensive to replace\n\nMainframes are the same. They do exactly what they need to do and have done it right for years. Sure for many IT reqs, you can spin up a Linux VM and create something apt for that purpose and there is far more need for more agile computing in this manner, but for good old number crunching on a grand scale, on something you need to be failsafe, these behemoths are absolutely your best bet\n\nAnd the mentions of security and so on - the AS/400 has some of the best security built in to that system.

While many are still running on old code, there’s been a resurgence in the past few years - incentivizing college grads to learn the older languages as well, since many of the Human Resources with the knowledge are retiring. There’s also a huge push toward modernizing the mainframe and creating native applications that can run on the mainframe so that they are able to use the data that’s stored on the (super secure) mainframe without having to offload it and risk security breaches. It’s a fascinating mixture of new and old. The next few years will be interesting for sure.",

Those floorboards are not only impossible to pry out because they are fundimental to the infrastructure, but public systems are stuck behind some of the tightest budgets and stickiest beurocracy you've ever seen.\n\nAs an example, my team is contracted out as the main IT team for a local county courthouse. There are literal teletypes, tape recorders, and specialized hardware terminals that MUST be kept running for various reasons, but chiefly because no one has manufactured newer versions or updated the software to run on modern architechture. Now, one could change the laws for printing out farming licenses or whatever, but that costs money to find an alternatibe. And this courthouse has only existed since the 90's.
