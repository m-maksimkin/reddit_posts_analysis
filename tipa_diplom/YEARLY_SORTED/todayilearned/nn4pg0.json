A lot of pet people are unstable people in some sense or another.  Not all by any means, but it absolutely exists.  We also see the spectrum of people that come in to our clinics from the nice lady with too many cat, to the controlling alpha who refuses to do anything that we recommend because they did it differently in rural Texas forty years ago like veterinary medicine hasn't advanced even since I started.  I've worked the spectrum from general practice, now to emergency for the last six months or so.  When I was in general practice I'd see maybe 5 or so euthanasia a month for our small practice.  When I moved to emergency that number shot up to in one ten hour shift we had fourteen of euthanasia/DOA.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd the veterinarians have it the worst.  The same stupid questions where people want to hear something specific and the doctor is going to tell them what they know they are going to hear.  But then that makes them the bad guy.  When I was going through early training there was a video I was watching about proper handling of patients in a way to reduce stress so the vet can examine them better.  My medical director walked behind me and saw the video saying very casually \"Oh that vet killed herself last year.  I met her at some conference just earlier that same year.\"  There was no remorse for what was said as it was just some matter of fact. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdministrators have a hard time in this industry as well, which not a lot of people realize.  Let me paint a scene for you.  You have to walk in to a room that a couple has just sent their pet back to treatment to place a catheter for administration of propofol and euthanasia solution.  It's your job to have these clients sign an authorization form allowing your veterinarian to euthanize their pet.  Then you have to have these people pay you to euthanize their pet.  I've had people flat break down in the room.  Others ask me how I do it.  A lot are honestly accepting but that doesn't make it easier.  \"I need you to give me payment to put your animal to sleep.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day we get blamed for being money grabbing, or not sympathetic.  I'll tell you now that everyone who gets in to the industry, EVERYONE, does it because we love our patients and not for the pay.  I've been sworn at, threatened, and the worst; downplayed.  Our management goes through the same thing, but at the end of the day we've got to make it to that point.  My mental health is not the same that it was when I started.  My empathy is both a combination of higher and at the same time calloused.  Yea I feel bad that your dog had a foreign body, or got hit by a car, ingested something toxic, or got heartworms from lack of compliance.  I'm not going to express that empathy in any way because one of us has to be the cool one or we're both going to crack.  It also seeps in to me personal life as there are plenty of nights I get home and want to just be left alone.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur industry is not okay.  With the pandemic more people got pets while they were home more often, and shelters saw an all time low in occupancy.  That translates to more people coming in on less staff with less resources with curbside exams.  SOS please send help.",

No disrespect to hard-working, decent veterinarians but the shifty ones are far more common than this OP would have you believe. I can give you three examples right off the top of my head from my own personal experience.\n\n1) I helped a friend out in an emergency with her dog a couple of years ago. When the dog was overdue to deliver her first litter she took it to a supposed emergency clinic. Mind you this dog had greenish amniotic fluid, obvious puss, dripping out. This clinic quoted an outrageously inflated price just for a few basic services, the kind of price tag that could keep those cash loan for your car title places afloat. Alternatively their advice was that they didn't see any obvious signs that the dog couldn't wait another 24-hours to go somewhere else during normal office hours. The next day I got a quote from a nearby fully equipped veterinary hospital. When we got there I had to carry all ~60 pounds of her in because she was too sick to walk. After I paid a deposit toward the surgery they then kept trying to adjust the price upward to the point where they were demanding triple the price they had quoted when I called. I took the dog to my vet who only has a small operating room. One of the puppies had died in utero and had begun to rot. The other one was alive but just barely, and died within the hour due to its heart giving out. The mother was so sick and shivering so hard with fever from the infection that she almost looked like she was seizing. My vet wasn't happy with me that I could only pay 50% of his fee until the other hospital refunded me. But he didn't blow it out of proportion either. He worked with me to give me a few days until the hold on the funds was released by the other practice.\n\n2) And that wasn't my only experience of being price gouged by that particular veterinary association, the one that tried to scam me on the cost of the dog's surgery. For what another of their affiliated clinics charged me to have my Flemish giant rabbit treated there I could've probably imported a truly \"giant\" one. That clinic didn't used to be that way when they were independently owned and operated, before they became part of the same conglomerate that tried to upsell on the emergency cesarian for the dog.\n\n3) I also knew a lady who took her little teacup dog to a vet, with a clearly broken back. She told them point blank that the dog got stepped on. That place did everything except for an x-ray, charged her over $700 for every other kind of test under the sun despite her ongoing protests, left the dog suffering in pain the whole while they were piddling around trying to run up the bill, and ended up euthanizing the dog anyway when they ran out of tests (i.e. excuses). These places with the ethics of used car dealerships are the reason some people are automatically suspicious of veterinary pricing.",

I guess she’d just received him, and wasn’t aware of his temperaments because when he saw our cats from across the street, she couldn’t control him and he pulled her all the way to my 10 year old cat. He bit into her side and all I really remember is waking up to her screaming and my cat yowling. I won’t go into details, but the injury was bad. \n\nWe were shocked and startled and the only thing that got that damn dog to let go was a fucking taser my boyfriend had on him. We rushed my cat to the vet where they told us it was going to be minimum 8k to do surgery and it still had a low prognosis. \n\nThe vet delivering this information to us was just doing her job, but our anger at the unfairness of it all was taken out on her. Not 30 minutes ago we had been waking up and feeding her, saying hello as she meowed her hello back. It was so sudden and we couldn’t deal with what had happened. So we sat in that exam room at the vet hospital for hours as we tried to figure out how we were going to get 8k together. \n\nEventually we realized we had no choice but to euthanize her. Just before it happened, I looked that vet in the eye and said ‘Your job really fucking sucks, huh?’ \n\nThis poor woman had to deal with the borderline verbal abuse we spat at her, euthanize our pet, and watch me point out how bad her job must be. No one grows up wanting to be a vet thinking of this aspect of the job, and this was really my first time ever actually considering it. \n\nShe took it in stride though. She agreed that her job sucked. She let us say our goodbyes and she stayed in the room with us as my cat passed away.

More and more corporate entities are buying out smaller and privately owned veterinary clinics - shifting to a large volume / higher profit style. The corporate scheme is not dissimilar with how human medical practices are run. The problem is animals are not humans - they are sentiment species and it is up to the veterinarian to parse out what is going on simply because the animal cannot speak for itself. In addition human medicine relies heavily on physicians assistance where is in veterinary medicine the licensed Veterinary support is extremely limited and difficult to come by.So the pressure associated with 15 minute appointments, unlimited walkins and the Expectation the vet will stay well past their shift to complete work outside of what they are getting paid to do is overwhelming. And the majority of veterinarians (myself included) are in the profession to help people help their beloved pets. A very honest sincere and noble endeavor. 90% of the complaints you will see online are related to cost. And one of the reasons telemedicine and veterinary practice is booming is for people to speak to a veterinarian about what the veterinarian they actually see in person diagnosed their pet with. Because their regular vet does not have the time to adequately discuss with them the condition. It’s a disaster. I totally get the veterinarian / suicide link. And in all honesty I do not think any of this would change even if we did not have “access” to lethal drugs. Anybody could kill them selves if they drink excess water. There are many ways to end the pain this profession imparts that don’t require access to drugs. To imply veterinarians can kill them selves readily because of their access to substances that allow for it is completely inappropriate and misguided.",

This is an opinion I formed from working in the dental industry and having a father that was a veterinarian. Also - older physicians of all types are targets for scams due to their accumulated wealth and success in business leading them to believe they can be successful in other areas of business.

More than likely they are having a hard day and a little empathy can go a long way. https://nomv.org/\n\nMy wife is an emergency and critical care vet. \n\nOne of her consistent complaints is about shitty owners. And not abuse and neglect. Just asshole people. \n\nOne that comes to mind is someone who came in on a weekend with a very sick pet to the 24 hour specialty hospital she was working at. She was picking up an extra Sunday shift because, like most vets, she came out of school with over a quarter million in loan debt. \n\nI don't remember the details, but the options for this dog were large bill or euthanasia. Owners said they couldn't afford it. My wife said \"let me see what I can do\".\n\nShe called a charity to see if they had funds. Got the surgeon to agree to waive his fee and have a resident assist as free teaching time. Convinced the clinic manager to drop the exam fee. And was working on a discounted plan to get them the best medicine at the lowest price possible but still ensuring the quality of care. This was all stuff she didn't need to do and which would result in her being at work well past her shift's scheduled end, which was 12 hours to begin with. All because she wanted to help them.\n\nWhile she was on the phone, the receptionist came back and showed her a Facebook post on a local town group. The owners had posted from the waiting room about how my wife was trying to screw them, how the clinic was ridiculously expensive, and how if she really loved animals she would save theirs for free.\n\nNow imagine that type of stuff happening every day.\n\nEdit: People have been asking what happened. She didn't even remember this particular story until I told her. It stuck out to me, but for her it was just another regular occurrence. This is normal behavior that veterinarians deal with every day.\n\nI do remember that she confronted them and called them out. I remember her saying they deleted it and apologized and sheepishly changed their attitude, but neither of us remember what happened with the animal or why it was there.\n\nEdit 2: she read lots of these replies and appreciated the nice ones. She also said the hardest part about being a vet is far and away dealing with the owners. Especially since covid happened and clinics got busier and people seem to have gotten meaner. So be kind and patient with your vets.",

On the flip side, some of the owners that actually care probably felt it safer to go to those better-established corporate pet hospitals.

I worked for a high end specialist vet hospital in Chicago where people could afford to drop 30k on a treatment deposit without blinking and even though I was paid well, never in my life was I more miserable and mentally unwell. You think you will be able to shake it off because you go in knowing how easy it is to have a breakdown and be over emotional over your pet but you really don’t. Clients would lose their fucking minds and threaten/abuse you like you wouldn’t believe. We had one British woman who was never fired as a client who kept English bulldogs that were all at deaths door. We called her the antichrist for a reason. These animals ethically should have been euthanized long before she came to us but she had unlimited funds and was totally delusional. She would come into the ER several times a week screaming and ranting about her dogs failing health and blaming us for lack of progress in their treatment (cancer, advanced age, obese). We would always whisk the dogs to the back and immediately try to work on stabilizing them. She would pace the waiting room and verbally attack the CSRs, demand that we made her cups of tea (we had a beautiful self serve station for coffee and tea) and she often threw them when she lost her temper. When the dogs were admitted, (always) she would call every hour on the hour for updates and we HAD to call the assigned tech to give them. Not every client was like this but honest to god, most were. Some of the best clients we had were personal assistants to celebrities because they came in, did what they were asked to do and left. Left the field permanently and all my old coworkers have as well. One of my Vet friends actually ended up going to human Med school and even though she loves animals and misses that aspect of her job, she is like a new human being. \n\nI think the combination of out of control emotional outbursts and clients who have a crisis they can’t financially overcome is why most people leave the field. Top that off with having at least one daily case of negligence that is entirely preventable with basic pet care and it slowly kills you inside.",

He's probably about 65. Been a vet a long time and hopefully going to retire soon... he's seen a lot of stuff, helped a lot of animals, and of course watched a lot of them pass on. He's our next door neighbor and I feel like he thinks of my wife and I as his pseduo-kids. We're the same age as one of his kids, but they're all scattered around so he doesn't see them a ton.\n\nOur cat had always had a bit of a rough go with health. Never anything insurmountable, but enough to always have us a little on our toes with worry. Well last year some issues came up, we tried out best to figure out how to help the issues with advice from the vet, but couldn't for awhile. Eventually we figured out it was cancer, and she was gone within about 3 months. When it was time for her to go, it was late on a Sunday evening...we called our vet, mostly just for advice at this hour (he's not an ER vet), but he came over to our house, picked us up in his truck, took us to his closed office, unlocked everything, prepared what was needed, and sent her on while giving us as much time as we needed to say goodbye...completely off the clock and entirely outside of any sort of professional expectations.\n\nIt hit us really hard and we were a mess in that office. I feel like he was probably watching his pseudo-kids losing it after he put down what was sort of his pseudo-pet as well and I'm sure he was feeling a lot of weight.\n\nA couple months passed, we had seen him many times in the neighborhood, but one day we were passing by and my wife said \"Hey, we never got a bill in the mail for the night our cat passed.\" He looked straight at us and said \"Oh really? Rats, I wonder what happened...\" and then waved to us and continued on his way. My wife and I looked at each other, astounded and then cried all over again.\n\nIt's just one story, but it's all to say that I hope all the vets out there get all the love and respect they deserve...because I can't imagine anything harder than trying to treat a hundred different species of living beings you can't communicate with, while also dealing with a million different emotions from people you mostly can't figure out either.",

Then they told us abruptly to come and pick him up,  no apology or anything. We had all just been taken on an emotional roller-coaster thinking we were going to loose a family member, only for an unapologetic joke of a vet to just nonchalantly say they misdiagnosed.\n\nNeedless to say, we were all fucking fuming with the vet for doing that to us, for being so utterly incompetent in their diagnosis and for just how rude they were in that they never apologised once.\n\nThose kinds of vets I think should be given a harsh talking to by customers.",

If your pet dies of natural causes, I can guarantee you most of the time your vet did everything they could, death is just, sadly, a part of life. If your pet has to be put to sleep for whatever reason, the vet is sparing your pet further pain and suffering.

Those people often play at our emotions with questions like \"will you let it die then?\" I mean, things /cost money/. We do not get meds for free. We do not get an X-ray machine for free. We will treat your pet, we do not want it to die.  But please at least be aware of costs before coming in.\n\n\nStill, the feeling of guilt doesn't go away.\n\n\nI'd say that most vets - if not all - work in the field thanks to their love for animals. Then they have to deal with said animals' owners, who shouldn't be allowed to take care of an ant, witness dogs bred until they get pyometra, die of ehrlichia, old bite wounds who got infected, and god knows what. At that point it feels like you need to convince the owner to take care of their pet. You wanted to save animals, right? Prepare your human skills. You'll need to read the owner before you even see the animal. Make sure they can administer the meds properly. Make sure they are willing to pay for testing. \n\n\nThere are also the propaganda people who like shitting at vets for recommending spaying and neutering, saying it's all for money and that spaying and neutering is cruel, instead of considering the health benefits.\n\n\nI can talk about this forever, but I'll finish with euthanasias. They wear you down. Some of them are pets you've known for a decade. Yes, it's for their own benefit (we do not accept it any other way), but then the crying owners and relatives is just a depressing sight. We are glad to celebrate the life and mourn the death of your beloved pet, don't get me wrong. It's an honour to be a part of a bond so special. But as a vet you're expected to continue working normally afterwards - you don't get much time to think about it, digest the loss or mourn. No, you have to vaccinate the next patient, and then treat another abscess, and then... \n\n\nFor some people it's worth it. I'm only a tech for two years, but also a future vet, and the little moments of \"miracle\" is what  makes it amazing. The hospitalized cat that tried to kill you and is now happily purring and kneading you, or even just the random friendly dog that gives you a lick and a whole body tail wag. Nothing else comes close. \n\n\nHopefully it doesn't go away.",

As someone working in a vet clinic I will share some of my experiences and thoughts on this matter. \n\nMy boyfriend is a vet who ended up buying his practice because the former doctor committed suicide, and one of the techs’ mothers (who was also a tech) committed suicide as well. This is a matter everyone in the field is acutely aware of.  I agree with a lot of the points brought up by others in this thread: the constant pressure about production, having to euthanize treatable pets, being accused of greediness (meanwhile my boyfriend put in tens of thousands of dollars into keeping the practice a float in the beginning, and it was years until he ever actually received a salary). Other challenges include finding staff and cultivating a healthy work environment for employees (especially if you’re a small practice owner and RELY on only a handful of techs), and needing to take time off practicing medicine to deal with stressors related to running a business (again, especially if you’re a small practice owner). \n\nFinally, there’s the fact that you’re constantly being bombarded on your time off by family, neighbors, friends, friends of friends, and even people you met once 20 years ago, asking questions about their pets. Like with any other profession, sometimes you want to come home and not think about work, plus it puts you in a difficult position because you don’t really want to give medical advice if it’s a pet you’ve never seen, and it also fosters an expectation that you’ll be there to do favors for this person, until one day you can’t and they take it personally and ruins the relationship.\n\nI would like to close with some new and previously-mentioned suggestions for owners: \n1) Instead of berating a vet if you are unhappy with your pet’s care, find another vet who more matches your expectations\n2) Be kind and give the vet the benefit of the doubt, instead of assuming decisions come from a place of greed or ego, first assume they are trying to simultaneously practice the best medicine possible while also doing their best to use your finances as wisely as possible\n3) If a friend/family member/neighbor is a vet, best to wait for them to offer their services before wanting their professional help. If you really want them as their vet, first make sure they are comfortable with that, then ask them what you can do as an owner to make their job as easy as possible\n\nIf more owners follow these suggestions I bet we would see some improvement when it comes to the issue of vet suicides",

Etc, etc, etc.  \n\nVets get horrible reviews for not being able to save an unsaveable pet. They get physically and mentally abused. They see animals in horrifying condition. They are asked to kill perfectly heathy animals because they’ve become a nuisance (they refuse). They see owners decline treatment and they know the animal will silently suffer or worse. They get unrelenting guilt put on them. \n\nWe’re all awful people who drive luxury cars and laugh in our piles of money and mansions. Meanwhile, the staff parking is full of shit cars because the high majority of us live pay cheque to pay cheque. The vet industry is one of the lowest paid in the medical field. \n\nBut here’s the thing. We also get to save animals. We get to help someone be with their bestie even if for just a little while longer. We get to see pets who are close to death bounce back and become happy little animals again. We get to see owners cry in happiness that we saved their beloved pet. We get many gifts and thank you letters for saving owners buddies. \n\nIt’s so rewarding and so hurtful at the same. It’s a really, really hard job.\n\nEdit: grammar",

I know that bit about the feces because we took a radiograph of this cat and I saw all of its organs pressed up against its diaphragm. This cat would just lay in his kennel and stare, unblinking.

She pulls up 5 minutes before we close to pick up her cat. I take her into a room to start the conversation that we need to have. She asks me how it goes. I am trying to not say anything.

Things definitely need to change but there's no feasible way to change quickly or drastically enough. We deal with one of the worst loan to income ratio there is currently.  We are doctors that receive the same amount of training that human doctors do for the same damned cost with such a drastic pay cut due to lack of mandatory insurance and lower cost of medicine in general. We are also responsible for euthanizing animals which is a heavy loss on our souls as we are generally type A people trying to fix every problem and get into the field in the thought of healing everything we touch. People expect so much more from us than human doctors in a good amount of respects in my opinion. I never expect my doctor to call me back immediately with lab results, discuss every little problem, or update me as often as people expect me too for their animals. You'd be lucky to speak with a nurse. When people won't pay for diagnostics or gold standard therapies I'm expected to know exactly what I'm treating and fix an animal. With the current COVID environment we have been slammed with a drastic influx of cases for hell knows why and we are all burnt out from it. Compassion fatigue and decision fatigue are awful to deal with and continuously compound no matter how we handle it. People expect us to have all the answers with minimal database/knowledge and answer all their questions immediately with 100% accuracy. Don't get me wrong, I love treating the animals and I can't see myself doing anything else. It's mainly the clients/people who are the problem. They are exceedingly needy, ask so many unnecessary questions, find problems where there aren't any, complain about every little thing, try to sue us for their own faults, euthanize when so many treatments are available but can't due to financial constraints or straight up unwillingness, and make us feel like a failure when their pets die when they refuse the treatment offered. And when there is a case for an animal that obviously needs to be euthanized but owners won't let go your are forced to attempt therapies to fix a problem you know that won't get better. It hurts man. It tears you apart which is honestly the worst for me. Owner's never know when to let go and I feel like a freaking therapist counseling owners through when to kill their pet. I wasn't trained for this shit. The problem that needs to be fixed is the system that organized vet med and the general public...but good luck with that. If you're in the field and having issues, please seek mental help. You are loved and this field is not worth your life.

            "text": "My wife is a veterinarian, so I've heard many of the issues that vets face on a day-to-day basis (typically over Mexican food).\n\n1. Owners pulling a \"you don't care\" or race card when the vet can't fix or euthanize their animal for free. (The sad part being that many of these animals COULD have been saved, however, the owner waited until they were circling the drain before bringing them in). Vets do care, a lot, and the last thing they want to see is someone taking an animal back home without treatment or at least something to help with the pain.\n\n2. \"You're just in it for the money\" or that the vet is trying to recommend unnecessary services or treatments. Well, yes, they're not a charity and have to pay back a quarter million dollars (or more) of loans.. but, no, most vets would never recommend anything that wasn't necessary. People seem to say this most regarding animal food/product sales (most vets make $0 on product sales) and when their pet needs dental work. The phrase \"it's like pulling teeth\" exists for a reason.. pulling a healthy tooth is VERY difficult and not worth any extra amount of money (some vets refuse to do dentals at all).\n\n3. When a pet has to be put down, it's an emotional decision for the vet almost as much as it is for the owner. When the vet has done everything possible to save a pet and they still end up having to euthanize, it takes a terrible toll on them. Vets have the feeling of failure combined with the condescension and anger from the owner (likely arguing about paying a bill for a pet that was euthanized in the end) and the loss of a life. Vets truly care for the animals that enter their lives, however briefly. That's why they went into this field when they could have become human doctors or anything else.\n\nThere are many other issues, but I'll be needing Mexican food if I keep going..\n\nFor any other vets out there, there's a Facebook group called \"Not One More Vet\" that gives emotional support over these issues and more. My wife has received some great tips, counseling, and motivation from the group, and I would highly recommend joining.",

            "text": "I wanted to be a veterinarian my entire childhood. When I started college, I began working at an animal hospital. Let's just say that after a year of working there, I decided a career in anything else would be better. I worked there for six years and that was more than enough time for me. I don't know how people do it for a lifetime. It's not about the animal care. Sure, putting down animals is depressing, but there's plenty of opportunities to save lives too. It's the people that made me change my mind. People are horrible. There were so many awful people, it's hard to say what was the worst. \n\nPeople abuse animals. The abuse is sickening. I've seen things I didn't know were possible before working at a vet clinic. Some things you just can't unsee no matter how much you wish you could. \n\nPeople think animals are disposable. Too many people get puppies and kittens for their kids and don't consider what happens once the baby becomes an adult. I started off trying to save them all. It didn't take long before I ran out of friends that could take another pet. One friend was evicted because he wasn't supposed to have pets, but he'd taken in 2 dogs that needed homes. The dogs were more important than the apartment to him, so he moved. Too bad the people that dropped off the dogs originally hadn't felt the same. \n\nPeople try to guilt trip staff into free service. You must like animals to work at a veterinary hospital. So, it's difficult to remain upbeat after hearing how a bullet in the head is cheaper than putting an animal down properly. When a procedure is too expensive for someone to afford, it isn't the staff's fault. \n\nPeople think their pets are perfect. I'll never forget the blood- curdling scream of my coworker when she was mauled by a husky. The dog tore her face into pieces. She needed several surgeries to repair all the damage. The owner was angry because we upset his dog. The owner was standing right there while his dog ripped off a woman's face and he was angry at the victim. \n\nPeople think everyone exists to make raising their precious child easier. It's never fun when mommy comes in with sniveling Sally and thrusts a box with an obviously dead animal into your face. The first time this happened, I was confused as to why mommy didn't know the animal was dead. Then, I realized, mommy didn't want to be the one to tell little Sally her precious bunny was dead. It was surprising how often this happened. Veterinary staff do not exist to be the \"bad person\" that explains death to children. \n\nPeople are insane. Deciding a puppy is possessed because it is hyper seems far-fetched; puppies are hyper by nature. Feeding the puppy candy while explaining its satanic possession, makes the story even more far-fetched. The story makes sense once the woman spills the contents of her purse on the counter and out rolls several anti-psycotic medications. Just because you know a person is having some kind of mental health issue doesn't mean you can take the puppy from her. That puppy was dead shortly afterwards. \n\nThe list goes on and on, but I'm too tired to write more. I understand why veterinarians have high suicide rates. Plus, he job doesn't pay like a human doctor.",

            "text": "Hey, small animal general practice and emergency Veterinarian here. \n\nThese are the things I find bring me the most stress in my profession, or make me the most depressed:\n\n1) Ungrateful, disrespectful Pet Owners. It's not the pets fault the owners don't have money. It's not the pets fault that the owners didn't train the puppy. It's not the pets fault the owners don't provide regular care, preventative care, or vaccinate the pet. So when the pet comes in I feel a need to get that pet treatment no matter what. I bend over backwards to provide discounts, multiple treatment options, multiple payment options, or just simply leaving things off the bill. The clients that need this much help are never appreciative and they often immediately try to take advantage of the situation. They seem inconvenienced by how long things are taking. They will complain and write bad reviews.  They will post Go Fund me scams and then they don't even use the money on the dog. It's disheartening, and its insidious how it slowly wears on you. I just wanted to help your dog, you don't have to be mean about it.\n\n2) Corpratization of Veterinary Medicine - Veterinary medicine is being completely overrun by hedge funds, speculative investors, and international corporations. They know veterinarians will work for basicly nothing, they know that the prices are too low, they know they can cut staff down to a brutal minimum number and the veterinarians will still show up to work no matter how bad the corporations have gouged the humanity and the dignity out of the profession. They are buying up practices by the dozens. The older practice owners won't sell their practice to me (tried with 3 different practices), because the corporation is more than willing to pay 20% above what the practice is actually worth, just because they have the capital to do it. The Boomer generation wants to retire in style and many of them are selling out the profession to corporate, inflating veterinary hospital prices. The end result being an entire generation of veterinarians cannot buy into practices that then end up being your retirement plan. Which brings us to part 3.\n\n3) No possible retirement plan - I have done everything right. Paid off college loans. Did instate tuition for undergrad and doctorate. Invested and saved as much as I can. Live in a small house, small car, nothing fancy in my life at all. I will still never make enough money to pay off my student loans AND retire. I have to choose one or the other. Pay off the student loans or save for retirement. Every dollar I save now is going towards a 20 year \"tax bomb\" after loan forgiveness kicks in.  Many of my classmates that don't have rich parents are in the same boat. We will all be 20 years into the profession just barely able to pay off the \"tax bomb\" and only THEN can we start saving for retirement at 20 years into the profession already. An entire generation of veterinarians that will never be able to retire.\n\n4) Animals are sometimes hard to work with. All I want to do is help the animal, all they think is that I am trying to hurt them. As much as I love animals, its very tiring that I can go an entire day and every task like looking in the ears, checking between the toes, and looking in the mouth is a constant battle. Every simple procedure needs sedation in some pets, requiring more time and stress to do even basic things. As much as I practice \"fear free\", premedicate, and help owners to better train their pets for handling at the vet, its still a constant strugle. I am just trying to help you man, just let me look in your mouth!\n\n5) Spread too thin. I feel like I have to be 5 professions in one. Internal medicine specialist, Anesthetist, General Practicioner, Phlebotomist, Surgeon, Receptionist, Psychologist and behavioral specialist.\n\nWhen you go in to see your human doctor for your anual does your doctor draw your blood? Nope. But a veterinarian does. Does your general practice doctor also perform surgery while doing your anesthesia at the same time? Nope. But a veterinarian does. It is absolutely crazy how many things you have to be good at just to be a \"half-decent\" veterinarian. \n\nIt's tough in any profession, I know. There are lots worse struggles to be had in life, I am sure. But these are the ones that prevent me from enjoying my profession and generate those flickers of suicidal thoughts from time to time.",

When she doesn't have availability she redirects them to an emergency vet and then they get pissed at her because emergency vets are too expensive and they call her heartless for not helping their pet.\n\nOr someone will accuse her of money grubbing when she tells them the cost. (And she makes less than 6 figures) or, as the title says, she has been blamed for the death of a pet.\n\nPet medicine uses the same materials as human medicine, and being a vet takes 7+years of schooling plus ongoing training to keep a valid license. My mom does her best to work with her clients for a payment plan that works, but the cost of paying her employees a minimum wage, general business maintenance, and the cost of materials is what it is.\n\nHaving an established relationship with a vet can help ensure that when you do have emergnecies or expensive bills, your vet can fit you, an established client, in on short notice. And your vet can trust they can work a payment plan out with you.\n\nMy mom decided she wanted to be a veterinarian when she was 7 years old. And its because she loves animals. She truly cares about the work she does, she truly wants whats best for peoples pets... but she has to keep the doors open, and vet care isn't cheap.\n\n(Having just spent $2000+ on her own dog, no one is exempt.)",

Part of that comes from living in a country with very good public healthcare, where a lot of medications are mostly covered by government funding - the same medication for their animal costs a huge amount compared to what they would pay. People also seem to forget that it is a business - they do need to pay rent, power and other overheads, as well as purchase/maintain all the diagnostic equipment etc, all of which costs a lot of money. \n\nWages for vet nurses and admin staff are often minimum wage (around $20 an hour here, which is a little below a living wage). Vet salaries rarely get into 3 figures unless you are a specialist or own the clinic.\n\nHours are long and most clinics are understaffed as there is a shortage of vet, techs and nurses. Breaks are often minimal despite a legal requirement to have a certain amount of breaks in a given period - the workload is just too high and few clinics seem prepared to turn people away (not talking emergency stuff but routine things too).\n\nAdd in arsehole clients, clients who think they know more than the vet, who expect a diagnosis without wanting to pay for necessary tests, having to put down animals on a daily basis and you've got all the stress you need for a high suicide rate.\n\nThankfully the majority of clients love their animals and genuinely want to do the best by them. Amazingly some even thank her for putting their pets down - knowing how empathetic she is and how high a standard of care she tries to provide I understand why.

Have to make very hard decisions everyday.\n\nA lot of young vets change their field of career during their first three years of practice and go work in the food industry or pharmaceuticals. Not because they don't like the job but because the pressure from the owners is just too much.\n\nIt's sad how having one appointment with a shi**y owner can just ruin your day even if it was filled with wonderful owners. \n\nThe days can be very exhausting. You start your day with a full program. But have to add a patient you saw the day before that is not doing better, an emergency surgery and some administrative work that cannot wait. You then have 5 minutes to eat your lunch. You're running super late in you're appointments. And still have to stay calm when people tell you you have no heart and the only thing you think about is money because you can't help them for free.\n\nPeople can be so mean on social media. But please people don't hesitate to leave a comment if you're like the service that has been offered.\n\nOne day I had to do a minor surgery procedure on a dog. The general examination and blood test were perfect, the anesthesia procedure was safe using volatile anesthesia for maintenance. Unfortunately the dog did a cardiac arrest during the procedure. I'll skip all the details but we managed to bring him back but the lack of oxygen he had was too important so he had irreversible brain lesions. We finally had to euthanize him. I was very involved in all the process and did my best to support the owner in that very hard moment. In those situations you always try to see what went wrong. Did I do a mistake? What really happened? The owner then said what's still carved in my head \"you killed my dog and you killed me\". And it in those times that you want to stop everything. You ask yourselves is it really worth it?\n\nFor now my answer is yes it's still worth it. There also is a lot of wonderful people in this world. And I'm filled with joy by doing my work. \n\nYou don't know what your vet has just been through before seeing you. Don't hesitate to tell your vet he's a good vet with a good heart if it's the case.

It was the middle of the night and I was the only dr, but against all odds I got access (intraosseus catheter) and freaking got it back. It was in BAD shape and it should’ve been allowed to die, but the owner had demanded CPR. Often after that initial rescue there’s time to talk about the hard reality of the state the pet is in and how low the odds are that the pet will survive, but the owner still had us do it all - we did full labs, abdominal ultrasound, echocardiogram. We found it had severe heard disease/failure and had ovarian tumors that had spread through the body. Based on these findings and the fact that the hamster was doing really poorly, was suffering, and was almost certainly going to die in our ICU, I recommended euthanasia to the owner so she could be with her hamster as she passed. She agreed, came to the hospital, and her hamster passed peacefully.\n\nA few months later I got a certified letter telling me that she had taken me to the board and was petitioning for me to lose my license for forcing her to euthanize her hamster. She also brought the radiologist who did the ultrasound and cardiologist who had done the echo to the board. She spread my name around the internet warning people against letting their pets be seen by me. \n\nIt still haunts me - that experience of doing what I knew was wrong (pulling that hamster back from death) and not “standing up” to the owner right off the bat... and then the worry that I should’ve never offered euthanasia in case that 0.001% chance of (brief) survival to discharge. Also knowing that someone feels so horribly about me despite me putting every bit of my good intention, education, and heart into taking care of the poor hamster the best I knew how... needless to say the board discarded the complaint and the internet eventually pushes “those” search results lower down.

I then remembered when my dad told me he was driving down to the pharmacist to ask them why they didn't fill a prescription etc.  I was like \"you know dad this isn't their fault it is the insurance company or the Dr. for incorrectly requesting the prescription etc\".  There are professions that unfairly take the brunt of people's frustrations and vets are one of them.  People forget that vets go through the same time of training that human Drs. do and yet we think their prices should be lower.  Have you ever looked at a bill from Drs. visit?  $800 for an ultrasound!!  But you have insurance so it gets covered (most of the time) and you move on and don't think about it.  But if you don't have insurance for your pet and you get a bill for $1,000 it feels like they are being crooks.  \n\nThe vets costs aren't all that different from humans, except their patients can't talk so they have to be even more in tune with the pets feelings.  And they get labeled as uncaring and money grubbing when it is simply the standard cost of providing care.  I watched my previous boyfriend debate taking his dog to the vet one weekend because he had taken him 2-3 times before in the last 6 months and each time he came away with a $200-$300 bill and it always turned out to be nothing.  He felt such guilt after waiting those 2 days for the last time he took his dog to the vet because this time it was serious.  \n\nWe make decisions, big and small, for our pets and they should always be for the well being of the pet, but a lot of times there is a financial factor.  And when you have to battle internally whether or not you can afford to save your pet's life....it is heartbreaking and upsetting.  And pet owners take that out on their vets and staff.  The vets and staff cry with you as you put your pet down.  They have also established a bond with the pet if you are going regularly...and to have to do that day in and day out and get yelled at regularly while you are forced to perform economic euthanasia....its soul crushing.  Everyone try and be a little nicer and understanding to your vet staff.  They got into this profession because they love animals.  Also please research a good pet insurance company if you can or make a point to put $25+ away each month in case of an emergency.  Veterinarians charge what they do because that is the cost of care as established by our medical system.  It is hard enough to deal with death and grief as often as they do and the last thing anyone needs is someone then doubling down because they got a bill they don't like.  Support your vet.  Ask them what you can do to help support their community.  There are organizations available to help people, but you can also do little things during interactions with your vet.  Tell the you appreciate them and all that they do.  A kind word or gesture can make a bad day worth it.  Just remember that tomorrow they have to do it all over again.",

            "text": "Another vet here, throwing in personal experience on the subject. I’ve been out of school & in practice for one year now. I have never been a DVM outside of a pandemic. I’ve worked in the field for almost a decade, but wow people are dicks right now. After just one year, I’m feeling incredibly burnt out. Not suicidal, thankfully, but I can see how easy it would be to get there mentally. I apologize for the slightly angry & disorganized tone here, but I have a lot of pent up feelings about this topic. \n\nThe ugly clients are entitled, either have no money or don’t want to spend it and blame ME for this, waited so long their pet is too far gone for God himself to fix them, or think they know better. Owning a pet is luxury, not a right, and therefore a personal financial responsibility. I cannot and will not work for free, no matter how much I love animals. I’ve dedicated my life to animals and owe over $400k in student loans from vet school alone. I will never pay that back. I’ll be making huge monthly payments for the next 30 years until the government forgives the balance. It’s an enormous source of stress and I’m extraordinarily lucky that I have a spouse with a well-paying career to keep us afloat. In my case, I’m also an associate doctor, not an owner. So I don’t have the liberty to give discounts. So, after working my ass off to get this point and giving my heart and soul to help a patient, being accused of being uncaring, money hungry, “not a real doctor”, scam artist, or any other cruel name I’ve been called is a massive slap in the face. I don’t run “unnecessary” tests, I don’t prescribe your pet “poison”, and I’m not “scamming” you. I am trying to do my job and help you and your pet through medicine. The human-animal bond if REAL and a huge part of my job. You don’t get into vet med because you hate people. We are here to help, trust me. \n\nA side note: if you have pets, please please look into pet insurance, or at least set aside an emergency pet fund. This is often called a “GDV fund” in the field. GDV is an acronym for gastric dilatation and volvulus, AKA “bloat”. It’s a common yet usually treatable emergency—a typical bill including diagnostics, stabilization, and corrective surgery is $6k+ depending on your area. So a good rough estimate for an emerg fund is around that figure. \n\nA second side note: I see a lot of people saying that the hardest thing for vets is that they’re dealing with euthanizing animals and suffering patients and similar situations. Yes, absolutely, seeing my patient suffer is gut-wrenching. Not being able to do anything about for medical/financial/any other reason just plain sucks. But, in my personal experience, euthanasia is not a contributing factor in burnout and stress. Sure, there are days I feel like Dr. Death, but generally euthanasia is a weirdly good thing for me. The Greek word euthanasia means “good death”. And it is. I’m not saying I enjoy “killing” your pet as so many angry people might interpret this as, but I DO enjoy giving your beloved pet a peaceful, dignified, painless end to their suffering. It’s an absolute gift that I wish human beings were allowed at the end of their lives.",

He left a very shocking and cruel good bye letter stating that he wasn’t happy and would like to start over his life. To be free. Without wife and kids.
