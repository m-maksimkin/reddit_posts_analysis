In the same town, the SS had a concentration camp where several Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses were imprisoned. The Witnesses were there because they refused to support the Nazis war efforts and ideology and especially refused to salute Hitler, believing this to be a direct blasphemy against God. Himmler went out of his way to boast to them that the Nazi Reich was stronger than their God and his Kingdom, personally ordering the execution of many members of their faith in the camps. \n\nWhen the Nazis were losing the war, an order was put out to execute all the Witnesses in the camp because they knew where the Nazis had hidden a huge stockpile of stolen art and treasure. The SS guards marched them out into the woods and were intending to gun them all down and make it look like the Americans had done it. \n\nAll of a sudden, the SS came under fire from the actual American forces, scattering them in panic. 11 Witnesses ran for cover to the castle and into the North Tower where they were completely protected from the battle outside by the castle‚Äôs 9 foot thick walls. This was the exact place in the castle that Himmler had set up as the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù of his new Aryan religion that he boasted would rule the world for 10,000 years. The SS outside were all killed or captured in the battle and the Witnesses waited until nightfall then escaped to freedom.\n\nEssentially, Himmler had made a bunker that saved the lives of the very people he wanted to exterminate.",
