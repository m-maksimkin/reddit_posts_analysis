He'd grown up around them so he wasn't really afraid. You just had to be confident and most of the time they'd go along.\n\nEven the goats could give you a bruise and the chickens could give a nasty peck if they were upset. Those things didn't bother him at all. There were many ways to get hurt or even killed on the farm. Failing to lock out a machine for maintenance, failure to brace properly, not turning things off when trying to fix them, getting in front of things where people couldn't see you. There were lots of things on the farm that were dangerous.\n\nStill, the thing Tommy was really afraid of, the thing he had nightmares about, was the grain. In addition to the small herds of animals the farm grew wheat. It stretched out for miles around the farm. It would start out green and small in the spring and then grow to waving gold stalks in mid summer.\n\nHe'd watched the wind ripple the stalks his entire life. They always seemed to be moving even when there was little wind. They were like a golden ocean that waved and rolled and hid its true nature beneath the surface.\n\nSometimes he'd stand at the edge of the fields that came up almost to his mother's vegetable garden and watch the wheat. He always felt the wheat was watching him back.\n\nHis uncle had died in a silo. He knew better but when you get in a hurry you forget. There was a clog and he tried to clear it. Before anyone could even yell he was over and in. He disappeared under the grain in seconds almost as if something had pulled him under.\n\nEverything stopped at once and everyone worked to get him out. By the time they got him it was too late. He was pale. Pale like a ghost. Like something had sucked the life force out of him. He just laid there on the dirt with the grain dust drifting down onto his body. Sometimes Tommy dreamed about that as well.\n\nTommy knew who the real killer on the farm was. It was bunched up and angry in the big silver silo right next to his father's big white barn. He could feel it as he walked through the yard to get to his bike. He could feel it as he did his chores. He could feel it towering over him always reminding him it was waiting. Waiting for the day when he would be the one responsible for its imprisonment.\n\nIt haunted his dreams. He'd be alone in the middle of a field and he'd start to get sucked under the stalks. He'd scream but no one would hear. Down he'd go until the stalks were bending to close the little circle of blue above him. They'd hiss and he'd wake up. He had lots of dreams about the wheat. He wished he didn't.\n\nNow summer was in full swing and he knew he'd be helping with the harvest. He liked riding in the combine. It was almost like you were slow flying above the fields. You could imagine you were on an alien planet with a golden surface and you were a space explorer seeing it all for the first time. He always felt safe in the combine.\n\nThen the harvest would be done and that was when the knots in his stomach would start. They'd have the grain stored on the farm and he would feel it angry and resentful pent up in the big aluminum tube.\n\nHe knew it would try to kill someone. Everyone would show up and they'd laugh and talk and start to work never really thinking about the grain. But Tommy knew the grain was watching. He would watch back. The grain would whisper and hiss in the silo. Tommy would be ready.",

My other friend jumped from the top of the fully raised dump truck bed to the ground and lowered the bed fully.  He then hopped back in with a badly sprained ankle and they dug me out in time....

I could go in the grain barns but I knew to never mess with the grain pile or go on it. \n\nCrawling through the ducts in the empty grain barns was fun though.

Silos were another danger. We had fermenting hay and corn silage in our silos. My dad always told me to just stay out of them. Apparently soon after you filled them they put off toxic gases and could kill you if you happened to go in for some reason. The reason you'd go in would typically be to fix the machinery used to get the stuff out of the silo. The reason a 10 year old boy would go in would simply be to play. I have no idea how toxic it actually was but I knew to stay away. Farming is freaking dangerous. I look at a lot of the stuff I did as a kid and compare it to letting my kids do them now and there is no way.

Waited for 8 hours for the man who sent me in there to dig out the lower door to walk by (could hear him walking on the top of the ground level grain auger cover). I was sent in from the top with a shovel. I had to jump the last 15 feet into the grain because the upper ladder only went 1/2 way down in a 65 foot grain bin. The owner forgot to unlock the outer door to let me out once I had dug my way down to it to uncover the inner door. No walkie talkie, pre cell phone..I was just lucky that no one flipped the wrong switch and turned on the over head auger and buried me, or turned on the under floor auger to such me in and spit me out in 12 inch pieces a few hundred yards away...\n\nThat is only one example. Putting us teens in the bins without harnesses, without a safety 2nd watching, ready to pull you out (with the required harness and rope we were definitely not given to wear into the grain bin) if a grain bridge collapsed and buried you. \n\nPutting us in the bin while the under floor auger was going (with a shove to keep the grain flowing I to the auger). Putting us in the bins with sweep augers running to kick then and un stick them every time they hung up. \n\nOperating heavy machinery with no training. Fork lift, front end loaders, moving train cars (acquaintance across road from that job lost his arm moving train grain bins while I was working there).\n\nWalking along 13 inch wide elevated grain augers 70 feed above the concrete with no railing and no harness carrying a bucket of tools in one hand, and a bucket of grease, or vacume, or silicone sealant in the other was a weekly occurrence. \n\nClimbing an uncaged 25 foot ladder with one hand, while the other is holding a 100 lb sweep auger motor to lug it through the lower door of a grain bin.....no safety harness, no ropes attached to the auger motor.... just a \"don't drop that thing kid!\" From the boss.\n\n\nSnatching samples of popcorn grain while the 12 inch auger screw is still running to test its moisture content (because turning the machine off, while it is full, will stall out the drive belt and the then you have to spend hours vacuuming the entire length of the auger out all the way to the grain bin....often hundreds of yards of auger and tons of grain).",

            "text": "My dad was entrapped several years ago while I was in High School. He was completely engulfed by soybeans in a steel bin. He was very lucky to have been trapped near a fan (his only source of oxygen) because he was trapped under the grain for over 2 hours before anyone even knew he was missing. The local fire departments had just been trained on how to attempt a rescue, but they hadn't ever put the training in practice really. They cut the bin open near the base to try and release some grain out, but they cut it the wrong way and it didn't do a whole lot at all.\n\nAlmost the whole adult population of the county was there helping in one way or other; they were in the bin digging for him and listening if they could hear him, or directing traffic (it was near a state highway), or just getting water for everyone because, if that bin was full, it could hold 17 million pounds of grain. I was told at the end of my school day before basketball practice that my dad was trapped, but my aunt (his sister), who told me, also asked me not to go help. I was so mad at her, but now am pretty glad I wasn't there. After another hour and a half, he was found and pulled out of the grain. One farmer told me afterwards he thought for sure when they found him, they would be pulling out a dead body. When you pull someone out of grain, the pressure on them is so high that just pulling them straight out will probably rip off the bottom half of their body. So they made a makeshift coffer dam to ease the pressure, and then pull him out.\n\nHe was immediately life-flighted to the nearest big city hospital, and was lucky to escape with nothing but a really sore foot (they were discussing amputating it, but they didn't and it has mostly healed). Since then, our company has done a lot to minimize risk there, and have paid for the local fire departments' training in grain engulfment hazards. We have our own grain-specific coffer dam on site, and have donated a couple to local fire departments. We also should thank Nationwide Insurance for that because they helped pay for both of those as some local ag insurance thing.\n\nThe first time I was in a grain bin was 3 weeks later with my dad. I always kind of wonder if he had any trouble getting in grain bins after that, but he still does all the time. There are a lot of people who do very dangerous things to help normal people live safe lives. Farming and most agriculture is still dangerous even when you do everything right.

The part that really stuck with me was when we were learning not to mess around or specifically step over the power take-off (PTO), which my dad had literally screamed at me about, making sure I never ever did it. The PTO runs directly from a tractor's engine to another machine hooked up to the tractor that doesn't have its own power source, acting like a power cord. Except this power cord is an exposed metal rod, inches thick and feet long, that spins with all the force of the tractor's engine. To illustrate the point, they had this high school kid come in who had gotten his leg got caught in the PTO. This poor kid had gotten too close and the PTO caught his pant leg, snatched him up, and just kept spinning while his leg was wrapped around it. He showed us his scar and broke down crying telling us how his quick thinking brother had run to shut the tractor off and saved his life. I was already a bit unsettled by the PTO, but I never went near it after that. I will never forget his full leg scars, (incoming description!) with deep, deep gouges, like, between 6 and 12 inches wide, where it had spun against his skin and essentially tore-burned his leg away.

There was no way to accidentally enter a silo, and even if some mechanical part like a door hatch failed there was no way it would fall inward, a mechanical failure would actually prevent entry to the silo. For planned entries or maintenance entries we required 2 people observing at all times, a harness with a lanyard so someone could extract you from the silo at any moment, o2 sensors, and many other safety systems to ensure nobody could die like this.
