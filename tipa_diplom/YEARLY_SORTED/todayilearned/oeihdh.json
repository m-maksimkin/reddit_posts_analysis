On the one hand it seems a bit unappreciative of Vaive to brush the kid off but people are people and have good days and bad, (was Vaive known to be a dick all the time ?). For all you know Vaive might have been rushing to not be late to his Granny's 90th birthday... ?\n  \nThen Shanahan, for him to harbor all this animosity for years over something that as far as the reader can tell lacks context and then to take it out physically on the person when they meet 4 years later seems a bit unhealthy as well...  Maybe I'm off base here but the whole thing is a bit weird, even for an NHL Fairy Tale...\n  \nWhatever... what do I know. Makes for a good story... sort of.",

Asked us to keep it kinda quiet, would come onto the ice and help coach the goalies during practice. He was a parent who was super into his kids playing.

By 14 years old, anyone involved in hockey probably would've recognized him from following the sport as closely as one involved in it probably would. What I'm saying is, it's astronomically dumb to deny him an autograph because he's 100% going to have a platform to spread that story soon. It'd be like LeBron denying Zion an autograph when Zion was 14 lol.",

One summer I chose the week that Rick Vaive was the NHLer. Most of the NHL guys were awesome with us but Vaive spent most of his time at the other end of the rink, practicing by himself and showing off for the 15 or 20 parent spectators. My dad tells the story that Vaive would set-up a bunch of pucks in the high slot, then skate to the net and with his stick tap the 4 corner posts of the net (top left, bottom left, etc...), then skate back out to the pucks and proceed to fire wicked shots towards each of the corners. The sole purpose of skating to the net to tap the corner posts was to show the parent spectators what he was going to do. While his skills were impressive most of the parents just thought he was an a-hole. I mean, they'd paid good money for Vaive, the local NHL hero,  to be with their kids, not to show off for a few parents.\nI missed all this because I was down at the other end of the rink being coached by Walt Tkachuk and the other helpers.",
