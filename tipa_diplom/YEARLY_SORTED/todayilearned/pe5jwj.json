Crossing the Savannah River, seeing the Companion building outside of Columbia, South of the Border billboard and the SOTB sombrero and video billboard; however there was one landmark that also stood out for different reasons. It was a McDonald's billboard somewhere between Camden and Bishopville, SC (details are sketchy). It had Ronald McDonald on it and, during the day, it was just a normal billboard. At night, however, it became to most menacing Ronald McDonald you could imagine. It was something to do with how the light would reflect off the eyebrows that made it look so evil, but I would always be awake to see it.

He did it for 15 years, and as an actor and overall very charismatic and friendly person, it was a perfect job for him that had a very solid pay.\n\nEssentially all it entailed was driving around to various schools, charity events, and fundraisers to put on little shows. Singing, dancing, magic tricks, and overall just making people happy at events focused on doing good. Everybody loved Ronald and outside of the performing, he would just go around and talk to people and make them smile, and try not to break character too much when joking with adults. It's kinda funny to me that my dad also worked as a bartender before, but in hindsight, they're probably very similar jobs. \n\nAt one point, his bosses told him to lose a lot of weight for the job, and he knew it was kind of a bs thing, since he definitely wasn't overweight, but he did it anyway and lost about 40 lbs in a few weeks. As I recall, it was something like a few months later that he was laid off in 2011.\n\n I'll never forget the day he walked in the house and broke down crying saying he was fired. The reason really was just that they were phasing the TOMs out and were laying everyone off slowly. After 15 years of work, they offered him a $15K severance. Apparently the corporate lawyers weren't even told that he worked for that long.\n\nCorporate McDonalds sucks ass",
