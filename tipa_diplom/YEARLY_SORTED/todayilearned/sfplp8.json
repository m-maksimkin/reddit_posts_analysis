Hill's salary, and DiCaprio's acting paycheck, were mandated by a completely different union with different rules and exceptions. \n\nTheres also the issue of the actors agencies. An agent helps manage an actors career and find them roles, in return for a cut of the salary. Even if DiCaprio wanted to do the role for a minimal fee, his agency may not want to that would tell other studios DiCaprio can be bought cheap. That is bad for the agency. I dont know if Hill and DiCaprio have the same agent, but Hill's agent may have seen this movie as a career stepping stone and worth the lower fee than DiCaprios agent. \n\nOn paper this looks like a discrepancy, and to be fair there is still a lot of that that goes on in Hollywood (especially with race and gender), but in this specific case there isn't really anything to fuss over in regards to their paychecks.",
