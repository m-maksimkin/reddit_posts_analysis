Nah, it couldn't be a part of season 9, it couldn't even be considered a special episode, nah man, next season immediately begins after another but it's only one episode.\n\nThere's probably more weird cases like this on Animal planet since I didn't follow much, but seriously what kinda release format is this???

Fish just doing their thing to survive, not monsters. We humans just have the tendency to invade their territory, so accidents happen eventually. And he always emphasised the importance of conservation and sustainability, when it would have been very easy to advocate for fish genocide.

Muskies are pretty difficult fish to catch and that episode didn't even exaggerate the difficulty at all. \n\nI'm impressed he goes around the world and adapts to so many different techniques for different species. True he has local help but one thing that I really admire is his respect for other cultures and his efforts to speak the local languages. True fishermen know that it's impossible to master everything so there's really no place for arrogance.",
