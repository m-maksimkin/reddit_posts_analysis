This could also be why he's stopping traffic. It's not just a massive cry for help, a bid for someone to pay attention but also for a moment he's getting to control those cars. \n\nHe probably should be hospitalised as he's clearly a danger to himself or others - he's going to cause an accident - and he should be helped through some intensive therapy. But instead he's probably going to prison cos a jury decided he's being malicious, a judge sees him as 'insolent' and a psychiatrist doesn't understand how to communicate with someone who is, even temporarily, non verbal.

That goes away when the marijuana wears off...maybe. Returns when that individual partakes again.

Medications for Schizophrenia and other problems have terrible side effects. One of the worst is called anhedonia in which the individual feels no enjoyment or joy at all about anything.

There’s nothing wrong with any of them, no mental/physical ailments that prevents them from speaking or anything like that, they just are that way. Also they’re all varying degrees of quiet, but by far my Grandma is the most silent. She will not speak unless spoken to. Her replies/answers are short and usually one or a few words. She doesn’t do it out of rudeness, her quiet personality is just who she is. I love her nonetheless though, she is the sweetest Grandma 🤍\n\nMy Dad on the other hand, I’ve been told his silence came off as rude. He would literally not speak to anyone at his jobs, or classmates, etc. Rarely made friends, but mostly cause he didn’t care to have any. He would talk to my Mom but that was about it lol.  \n\nAs for me, I’ve been told by a lot of people including friends, teachers, people I’ve dated, etc that I’m also very quiet and soft spoken, but I don’t think I’m as bad as my Dad or Grandma. I actually do like having conversations with people, I’m just usually hesitant to be the first to speak.",
