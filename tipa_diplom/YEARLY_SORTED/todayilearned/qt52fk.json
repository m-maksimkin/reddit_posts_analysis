He now has two young kids (the youngest being only a few months old) and lives in New York, where he does research work with the NY Conservatorium of Music. Which is what he’s most passionate about, researching old music and instruments, and sharing that knowledge with the next generation. That’s been the motivation behind all of his work since ‘Making Mirrors’, with his fourth album essentially a showcase of various obscure instruments, with a different one forming the backbone of each track. At least, that was the plan, but as others have noted, financially, he’s fine, and he has the freedom to explore his passions without the pressure of touring, press, etc. \n\nSo there are two key elements at play. For one, he’s a perfectionist, and there’s a level of pressure following up MM. He does have a range of tracks basically completed, but whether they’ll ever get released is another thing altogether. Which leads to the other point - with a young family and a stable life doing what he loves, does he really need the extra pressure that going public again would bring? I suspect he won’t be releasing anything for at least a few more years, but he does have new stuff, and there is still a chance that it’ll come out at some stage. \n\nAlso, Wal is the most amazing, multi-instrumental, musical genius, as anyone who’s ever seen him live would attest. Skill and capability are not in question, which is why he could always release new stuff, at any time.",
