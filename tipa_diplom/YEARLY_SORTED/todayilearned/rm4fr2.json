Turned out the hairs of a gorilla were way more intricate to use cgi on than the lizard skin of dinos, so they had to cancel that idea and go with old school effects. Good thing they didn’t know about the whole feather thing back then or we might have ended up with guys in suits for the dinos like we did the gorillas. \n\nHowever, as they say, god gives all of us a flaw, otherwise Congo would be perfect. Any movie with Tim Curry, Ernie Hudson, Bruce Campbell, and laser activated 50 cal machine guns on tripods, you can sign me right up for. And that’s before you even get into the rest of the cast like Laura Linnie, that guy who played the evil terrorist in true lies, and cipher from the matrix!\n\nI mean, what other movie will you get lines like “why are they putting on parachutes?” “FIGURE IT OUT” from? Don’t even get me started on “stop eating my sesame cake”. \n\nLong story short, if you don’t like the cgi trend in modern movies, like baller movies with awesome casts and hilarious one liners, a bangin soundtrack, and enough adventure to inspire you to go backpacking through African river basins, give Congo another watch!
