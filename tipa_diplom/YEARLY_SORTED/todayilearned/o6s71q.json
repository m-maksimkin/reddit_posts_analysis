During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.\n\nSchwarzenegger joined a year earlier thanks to his father‚Äôs military connections, and hoped this experience would expand his horizons.\n\nArmy service set well with the young Arnold, because it fed his hunger for strength, power and control. He was underage when he was assigned to be a tank driver, and his love for tanks persists to this day. Schwarzenegger still had a couple of smudges on his record ‚Äì such as crashing a jeep and sneaking out of the base ‚Äì and ended up being honorably discharged in 1965.\n\nArnie wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave the base to compete in bodybuilding competitions, but that was one army rule he simply couldn‚Äôt follow. He went AWOL and hopped on a train to Stuttgart, where he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.\n\n‚ÄúParticipating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn‚Äôt carefully think through the consequences. When I got to Stuttgart, I was all confused. I forgot my posing routine, I had to borrow posing trunks, but I still won!‚Äù Schwarzenegger later recalled.\n\nNeedless to say, his commanding officers weren‚Äôt happy after learning he snuck out of the base. He was stripped of his tank driving duties, and ended up being sentenced to seven days in army jail, but officers changed their tune after seeing his trophy. They let him out two or three days later, and helped him work towards his goals by creating a makeshift gym where he could train.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger contacted the Austrian army in 1991 asking if he could have his M-47 Patton tank back. He got permission to ship the tank to the US, and he cashed out $20.000 in the process.",

I also love the fact that he spent something like $250k converting his enormously gas guzzling military hummer into an electric vehicle back in the 00‚Äôs when EV tech was mad expensive and not great at the time, just so he could continue driving such a vehicle and showing that it can be done.",
