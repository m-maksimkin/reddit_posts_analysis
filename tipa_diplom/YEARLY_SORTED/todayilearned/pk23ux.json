All that is claimed is the comparative of fruit to fruit. Not drink to drink. \n\nEdit* okay I actually bothered to read the article; meh. If they removed the word ‘Ribena’ from their claim; they shouldn’t have had a problem. Otherwise it’s just a fruit V fruit comparison which is factually correct.
