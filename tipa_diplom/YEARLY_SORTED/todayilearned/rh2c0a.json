Also how much more did the recall cost than to just fix the problem, an insane amount of money to be honest. So my guess is either someone high up lost their job or the information never got that far up the decision chain in the first place.\n\nSome engineers may have reported the fault several times but the information never got that far up so nothing could be done as it was individual middle management guys and girls who didnt know what to do with the information in the first place or because they believed some other department was in charge of it and not their job.\n\nso i would say its a structural problem inside the company based on the evidence we have here. That doesnt mean the company is bad or evil by any measure, because it seems like this is a problem which was caused by ignorance of those who could make such a decision before the release.,\n\nIt may even be a problem that is actually no ones fault even if the knowledge was there if you care to think about it for a minute.

            "text": "This is why punitive damages were invented, and why the Supreme Court fucked the pooch when it put a limitation on them based on compensatory damages.\n\nEdit. The case is Campbell v. State Farm. Here is a brief synopsis of why this is so problematic:\n\nAfter a trial, a Utah jury found that State Farm’s documented business model was so outrageous, they awarded the plaintiff $145,000,000 ($145 million) in punitive damages which are intended to punish a defendant for its malicious and/or fraudulent conduct. The question becomes, what did State Farm do that caused a jury to punish it so harshly? The answer is that the jury was able to hear secret information about State Farm’s “national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide. This scheme was referred to as State Farm’s ‘Performance, Planning and Review,’ or PP & R, policy.” Id. at ¶ 11.\n\nThis nationwide “PP & R” program involved numerous strategies used to reduce State Farm’s costs while maximizing its profits. Keep in mind that these strategies were nationwide, meaning the practices State Farm engaged in were not limited to Utah or any other state. Below are a few quotes from the Utah Supreme Court about what State Farm’s PP & R program actually meant for insureds and consumers. Keep in mind that these are quotes from the court and not opinions. Some of the Court’s language will be emphasized.\n\n1. First, State Farm repeatedly and deliberately deceived and cheated its customers via the PP & R scheme. For over two decades, State Farm set monthly payment caps and individually rewarded those insurance adjusters who paid less than the market value for claims.\no Agents changed the contents of files, lied to customers, and committed other dishonest and fraudulent acts in order to meet financial goals.\n§ For example, a State Farm official in the underlying lawsuit in Logan instructed the claim adjuster to change the report in State Farm’s file by writing that Ospital was “speeding to visit his pregnant girlfriend.” There was no evidence at all to support that assertion. Ospital was not speeding, nor did he have a pregnant girlfriend. Id. The only purpose for the change was to distort the assessment of the value of Ospital’s claims against State Farm’s insured.\no State Farm’s fraudulent practices were consistently directed to persons—poor racial or ethnic minorities, women, and elderly individuals—who State Farm believed would be less likely to object or take legal action. Campbell at ¶ 29 (internal citations omitted).\n\n2. Second, State Farm engaged in deliberate concealment and destruction of all documents related to this profit scheme. State Farm’s own witnesses testified that documents were routinely destroyed so as to avoid their potential disclosure through discovery requests.\no Such destruction even occurred while this litigation was pending.\no Additionally, State Farm, as a matter of policy, keeps no corporate records related to lawsuits against it, thus shielding itself from having to disclose information related to the number and scope of bad faith actions in which it has been involved. ¶ 30 (internal citations omitted).\n\n3. Third, State Farm has systematically harassed and intimidated opposing claimants, witnesses, and attorneys.\no For example, State Farm published an instruction manual for its attorneys mandating them to “ask personal questions” as part of the investigation and examination of claimant in order to deter litigation. Several witnesses at trial […] testified that these practices had been used against them..\no Specifically, the record contains an eighty-eight page report prepared by State Farm regarding [one of these witnesses’] personal life, including information obtained by paying a hotel maid to disclose whether DeLong had overnight guests in her room.\no There was also evidence that State Farm actually instructs its attorneys and claim superintendents to employ “mad dog defense tactics”—using the company’s large resources to “wear out” opposing attorneys by prolonging litigation, making meritless objections, claiming false privileges, destroying documents, and abusing the law and motion process. ¶ 31 (internal citations omitted).\n\n4. Taken together, these three examples show that State Farm engaged in a pattern of “trickery and deceit,” “false statements,” and other “acts of affirmative misconduct” targeted at “financially vulnerable” persons … Moreover, State Farm has strategically concealed “evidence of [its] improper motive” to shield itself from liability, which was furthered by State Farm’s treatment of opposing witnesses and counsel … Such conduct is malicious, reprehensible, and wrong. ¶ 32 (internal citations omitted).\n\nHaving this information, the jury decided to punish State Farm for its conduct by awarding the plaintiffs $145 million in punitive damages. The purpose behind punitive damages is to punish a corporation for acting maliciously or fraudulently. Corporations only change their practices if the practices are not profitable, that is the nature of a corporation. So presumably, State Farm would have felt the hit of a $145 million award against it and changed its “malicious, reprehensible, and wrong” behavior to avoid ever being punished so substantially again, right?\n\nNot necessarily. Unfortunately, the story does not end here. While you and I would certainly feel such a huge financial hit and change our behavior (as is the purpose of punitive damages), State Farm is a truly massive corporation. So massive, in fact, that at the time of this case in 2001, “$145 million is only 0.26 of one percent of State Farm’s wealth.” Campbell at ¶ 29. State Farm is so massive, that even a penalty of $145 million is relatively insignificant and constitutes less than 1/4 of 1% of State Farm’s total wealth in 2001. With such massive resources, which have only grown more massive over the last decade and a half, the punitive damages awarded against State Farm were not so massive as to substantially effect the company. They could have easily paid the damages, corrected their behavior to avoid additional suits, and moved on with an emphasis on rehabilitating its image in the public’s eyes.\n\nBut State Farm was not interested in paying the plaintiffs in Campbell $145 million. Worried that the decision inspire others who had suffered similar treatment to that of the Campbells to file similar suits, which would lead to more punitive damages, State Farm appealed the Utah Supreme Court’s decision to reinstate the $145 million punitive damages award against it (note: the jury’s award was initially reduced by the trial court, but after reviewing State Farm’s conduct, Utah’s Supreme Court reinstated the jury’s original punitive award). State Farm appealed to the United States Supreme Court, arguing that the amount of punitive damages violated its right to due process under the Constitution. Amazingly, the United States Supreme Court sided with State Farm and ruled that the size of the award was Constitutionally prohibited.\nThe High Court’s ruling in Campbell has set the standard for what is Constitutionally permissible when a jury awards punitive damages against a corporation. It is important to note that a jury can award anything it wishes, but the Supreme Court’s decision in Campbell requires the trial court judge to reduce large awards of punitive damages to, at the most, 9 times the compensatory damages. Compensatory damages are damages that are intended to compensate an individual for things like medical expenses, emotional distress, lost wages, etc.",

I ended up having to essentially “hot-wire” my car to get it to start for about a year. (Not sure if it’s technically hot wiring but it did the trick). The GM mechanic taught me how to do this because he knew that replacing my ignition wasn’t going to solve anything as it would just break again. \n\nIt was so frustrating knowing that the part was faulty in both of our cars and not being able to do a damn thing against GM, an unethical juggernaut of business. \n\nFast forward to when the recall was forced, and they had to refund all our repair money. Fast forward to last week and we received about $300 in settlements from the class action lawsuit as well. \n\nGM killed people - I hope those families get something big from this.",

Honda did a 10 year extended warranty if it happens to crack in that time frame.  Everyone else is out of luck.  Currently have one immobilized in my driveway waiting for a recall that will probably never come.",

The situation was pretty easy to explain, the ignition barrels if overcharged by, let us say too many keys or a big keychain, would switch the car off and people would literally lose power everything, and this could happen if you hit a pothole or just maneuver the car in a way where your keys would wobble around. \n\nThe coverage from the media was almost diametrically opposed, at Toyota journalists were hacking cars to show unintended acceleration, Toyota's CEO was on the congress floor apologizing profusely, it was pandemonium in the dealerships. Toyota literally had to chop accelerator pedals to avoid them being stuck under carpets and then reprogram the cars to insure that when pressed simultaneously the brakes would override the accelerator.\n\nAt GM, you literally had their CEO, Mary Barra who had been the manager of the Hamtrack plant, literally one of their head engineers for decades, their head of global engineering, I am 100% sure someone who was aware of the ignition barrel issue since the start, laugh her ass off as the Federal government fined GM 900 million$ for 124 deaths\n\nGuess how much they fined Toyota ? 1.2 billion, 89 deaths.\n\nBarra of course at least went in front of her employees and said that they had all collectively let everyone down !

They knew their son was a responsible driver and they kept on fighting the issue and never gave up. With their lawyers I believe they finally found a mechanic to look into the case. He was relentless and finally found an old ignition switch from an older model car just like their son drove. He found the spring in the ignition was a different size that was used in the older models. I believe the spring was slightly larger than the newer models. The issue was any significant weight on the ignition such as multiple keys or key chains would cause the ignition to fail in the on position.  The mechanic compared his findings with other vehicles and he realized he was onto something. \n\nFrom there the family along with the lawyers looked into the engineering behind the ignition with GM and found out they knew about the issue. Engineers from GM sent documents to the higher ups identifying the issue and it was swept under the rug. \n\nVery very sad story. Corporate greed and hiding their issues from the public because it would cost a lot of money to recall all the vehicles to fix the issue. It took over 100 people dying to rectify the problem.",

On most GM vehicles the hole for that key typically extends to both sides, kind of a design choice so there isn't a bunch of stuff binding, maybe a cost saving measure, probably just a massive oversight, ANYWAY;\n\nIt means if you've got a bunch of keys or dead weight added on it gives extra leverage to turn the key when you hit a bump, mainly to the off or ancillary positions. This will engage the steering lock which'd keep you from... Well turning... Yes you valiant keyboard warriors you absolutely can turn the key back and get your steering again but here's the thing. Most of the cars I serviced had about 3 keys, then a Grad pendant, a long lanyard (can go under leg and jerk the ignition... Seriously, ditch those) plus a weed grinder and several jewelery effects. They weighed an absolute ton and the type of driver who does this doesn't have an ounce of skill to pull themselves out of an emergency. \n\nThe recall fix was an outer layer that gets pressed onto the key with a smaller hole for the split ring. We had countless pissed off owners who thought it would be anything from a redesigned steering colum to a brand new car, seriously. But it can happen to a number of cars across all brands if you put enough weight or the ignition is worn out. Always buy a quick release system for your ignition key so you can take the other keys off when your car is running, if anything it keeps the other keys from banging on everything.",

The thing is that after it happens you can't start your car for another hour or 2. There just wouldn't be any power in the car. So I would have to wait. I took my car to a couple mechanics who couldn't figure it out. Finally someone referred me to a mechanic who specialized in electrical work. They had my car for 2 days and said they couldn't reproduce the issue. I told them a couple tricks over the phone to get it to happen and an hour later they call me to tell me they have it figured out and it would be $200 to fix.

Thought I had bought a really reliable car after owning a fucking Nissan that had the classic CVT transmission blow up at a little over 110k stranding us 5 hours from home. Anyway- driving my cool little Subaru for a week and I start noticing the engine sometimes doesn’t seem to respond to pushing the gas pedal- just seems to glide forward but not actually accelerate. Happened a few brief times that quickly resolved. Thought maybe it was me in a new car- then the battery died while parked in the airport. Got a jump even though I knew I left nothing on and it was a brand new battery per the dealer.  Okay- it was -5 degree for the several days it sat there.  Few days later I notice the brake lights on as I walk out of work in the dark to check the battery as it was very cold again. Impossible. Could t get them to turn off so I had to pull the fuse as I was working a 24 at the hospital. Out the fuse back in, starting driving home in the morning in I70 outside of Wheeling WV. same acceleration problem except it just slowly stopped in the middle of the highway and wouldn’t go- car is on but no acceleration. Multiple tractor trailers bearing down on me. Thought I was gonna die- tried one more time and made it yo the shoulder before it stopped again.  Got it towed to the local dealer- they can’t find a thing wrong. Called the original dealer who suggested I was maybe wearing different shoes driving or just didn’t know how to drive it (I’m a woman but fuck man- I’ve been driving for 30 plus years). Finally i mention the brake light- boom. He says welp that engine will cut off acceleration if it thinks the brakes are on so maybe that’s it.  Nope WV dealer can’t agree but does change the brake lights. I called Subaru who told me I should believe the dealer who said it was fine. I drive that car immediately to Mazda and bought a cx5 the same day. What really sucked is that two weeks later- Subaru issued a recall for this exact problem.

If you weren't a flagship-level dealer, you were getting shafted on your orders for the recall parts.   \n\n\nAnyone who dealt with delays, that's almost definitely what was happening. Or you didn't go in when they called and said \"Hey, your parts are here.\"  \n\n\nBecause since you WEREN'T paying out of pocket, those parts weren't really \"yours\". At least at my specific dealership, we'd hold them for a week, and then they were fair game. (We would obviously re-order to replace them, but you basically got shunted to the back of the line.)   \n\n\nThis is S.O.P. for most dealerships on any recall, because people get REALLY, REALLY casual about coming in for their appointments if they have no monetary investment. We regularly would order recall/warranty parts for folks, only to have them ghost us for 2-3 months, then just randomly show up one day and demand we fix the car because \"you told me my parts were in\".  \n\n\n  \n2)There literally was a quick fix, if we didn't have the parts for the recall: -take all the bullshit off of your keychain. Literally, just put the key on a separate ring with nothing else attached. It couldn't get enough force to shut off on its own at that point.  \n\n\nYou know what happened? Fucking people literally had a hissy fit and refused to do it. Like completely melting down because HOW DARE WE SUGGEST THEY NOT HAVE THEIR 88 POUNDS OF BULLSHIT ATTACHED TO THEIR IGNITION KEY. I literally had to step in between a service advisor and a woman who was LIVID that we wouldn't fix her problem (because we literally could not) and we were trying to \"violate her individuality\" (her actual words) by suggesting she simply pull her ignition key off and put it on a separate ring.  \n\n\nObviously, this was a very extreme outlier, but we got an insane amount of pushback for trying to do a workaround when we were out of parts.  \n\n\nThis was one of the key reasons I don't miss the auto industry at all.

It was incredibly shady on a grand scale.\n\nGM knew about the problem and deemed it was cheaper to deal with the potential lawsuits vs. actually fix the problem and save lives. This was occuring as lawsuits were being filed.\n\nWhen GM went bankrupt a few years prior to this massive recall. They knew about this before the government bailouts (as OP has said - In the early stages of the ignition switch design in the 90's iirc). They only issued the recall under immense pressure by the public and the government. GM argued that the fault was with \"Old GM\" and not the \"New and Restructured GM\" and tried to get away with it. They only performed the recall after they had been financially stable and used the government bailouts to pay for the recall.\n\nThe fuckery didnt end there.\n\nWhen new ignition switches were designed for the recall, the part number was the same. This is something you learn in the first few days of CAD design or first month studying Engineering. If you make a change to a part, you give it a different part number or at least a version number tagged on the end. GM did not do this. If you had your car with the recall and it was replaced, there was no way of physically telling if it had been replaced with the redesigned part or just old stock. GM had to redo the recall a 2nd time for a bunch of cars because there was no way of telling the difference.\n\nThis one I dont remember as well. \n\nGM since the 70's (iirc) has had a dollar amount to the value of a human life. Its been updated over the years. It was visible in a leaked PowerPoint presentation shortly after this ignition issue came to public light. It assisted them in figuring out if it was worth fixing the issue or just pay off the lawsuits and let it be.\n\nThis ignition switch was faulty from when they were manufactured. If a heavy keychain was attached to the key and placed in the ignitio and the car drove over a bump or pothole at speed, it would trigger the key in the ignition switch to go from On/Run to Accessory or Off. This would shut off the engine, engage the steering lock if turned too much, and lose the brake booster making it really difficult to press the brake pedal. The engineers knew this early on (during the 90's) and mentioned it to management. It was determined it wasnt worth fixing because who is going to have 1 to 2kg of keys and keychains in the ignition. Middle to upper management was wrong.\n\nThere was a ton more but those are just off the top of my head.\n\nDuring when all this information was coming to light and driving my dad's early 00's GM Minivan during that time, I always have my car keys by itself with maximum 1 keychain (just a hook to hang them). I will always do so too.\n\nSide note: It's always been a pet peeve of mine with people who scratch up the area around the ignition switch because of excessive keys and keychains. But that's me.",

The problem is 2 fold.  The first when GM mentioned keychains, it’s a widespread issue. You should never have more than they key to the car on said chain. It’s bad for any ignition. 99 out of 100 times I’ve seen ignition switch issues, the customer hands me a keychain that looks like they work as a janitor. Once this issue was discovered that should have been something issued to people in a notice. \n\nThe ignition shouldn’t be that easy to turn I agree. That could easily be fixed on cars produced after discovering that problem. This should have been a quick and easy fix. One with the right knowledge could fix the existing issues. I think obviously GM is at fault because they knew about the issue, yet didn’t say anything because of stock prices. \n\nThat being said just as a PSA: please don’t carry a bunch of keys on your car key ring or decorations.  They should be as light as possible (within reason) and your car will thank you no matter which car you drive. If you have a bunch of keys you need to carry for whatever reason put them on a second keychain that you can clip to yourself, not damaging your ignition. Over time it wears things down from the weight bouncing around. My personal car keys are 1 key to start (with built in FOB), 1 tail gate key because people are assholes and steal tail gates, and my house key. That’s it and an aluminum carabiner so I can clip my keys to a belt loop. If you have have 15 keys, 7 key chains, and a big poof ball, make a second set for just the car keys. If you have a new push to start vehicle do whatever you want lol. Use a cinder block as a key chain it won’t matter.",

A few months back I was driving home and there was a loud bang (I thought maybe I'd ran over a 2x4 initially). Engine light came on and began making a knocking sound any time I accelerated.\n\nLuckily, there was a dealership 5 minutes away. I brought it in and as I was explaining the issue to the dude at the front desk, a man got up from behind who had been listening in and asked if he could hear it. As I was walking out with him I asked if he knew what it was. He kinda smiled and said oh I'm almost positive but let me just confirm first.\n\nHe started the truck, said \"yep I knew it\", and called his coworker over to look. It was a bad lifter rod. Turned out mine had been the fourth 2021 chevy to come in with that issue that day alone.\n\nI warned a couple other coworkers who also got the same truck this year and sure enough just a week ago my friend and coworker had the same thing happen to him. He took it to a dealership where he knows a manager and got a little more info. Some one correct me here as the details are a little fuzzy coming second hand but I guess Chevy just changed the part number of the rod and are just installing the new ones as they come in since that works as some type of loop hole preventing them from having to make a recall and getting in the headlines.",

When the engine shuts off you lose stuff like power steering and maybe lights, but the car is very much drivable. Dangerous but not a death sentence.
