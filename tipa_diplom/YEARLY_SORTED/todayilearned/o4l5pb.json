They know, naturally, which chords should follow others that make both theoretic and aural sense with such immediacy. \n\nBeatboxing and singing songs and singing string arrangements is cool, but so far from ‘good composer qualities’ - he was definitely not a virtuoso composer - saying things like this does a massive disservice to the real virtuoso classical composers of old.",

I know, you can say that with other great performing and recording artist too, but there was something real special about Michael Jackson that made him shine above the rest.\n\nMyself being a old school washed up professional musician with a little recording experience from the 70's, remember all the old analog equipment, like tube amps, PA systems, mixing boards, and a 16 track recording studio.\n\nThese days, most everything is digital and a 6 year old kid could write and record a professional album right from home all by themselves, just using a computer, software, and a few odds and ends like headphones, microphones, playback speakers, and a few instruments, but those aren't even necessary.\n\nThe main thing is just the recording software that you can download for free online or buy it that can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars up to a few thousand bucks. All the amps, pa's, mixers, instruments, and effects can be interchangeable and virtual if you want to do it that way. The software can do just about anything like fix or auto-correct any mistakes you made and with having unlimited tracks so you could mix in 100 different kinds of instruments if you actually wanted too.\n\nSo like I say: imagining the all natural talented Michael Jackson being young in this day and age and having access to all the recording technology that we have today. Who knows what he may have created. All I know is it would probably would have sent people to the moon and back.
