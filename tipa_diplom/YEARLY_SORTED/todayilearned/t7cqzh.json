Not an opinion, [it's true](https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/stats.html).  Around the mid-90s there was this giant dump of former Soviet hockey players on the NHL who just so happened to play a very defensive game.  Save percentages went up shots fired went down.  With the current game there's absolutely no way for another Wayne Gretzky to emerge.\n\nIt's the same reason why Babe Ruth's homerun record could never be beat without the assistance of drugs.  Pitchers got better, far more strike outs far less home runs.  Even when it was beaten it wasn't necessarily beaten organically.  The pitchers facing Mark Maguire, Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds were throwing hittable pitches when strategically they could have just walked them.",

Gretsky, as great as he was, was able to score that many goals because he had body guards. Not taking anything away from his ability, but if he had to fight his own battles, he would've scored fewer goals. How many fewer is debatable. That he would've scored fewer isn't at all debatable.\n\nBobby Orr revolutionized how the game is played. Gretsky scored a lot of goals but didn't actually revolutionize the game. You would be hard put to show me how the game is played differently because of Gretsky but I'll listen. Prior to Orr, defensemen stayed 'at home' and didn't score goals. Post-Orr, you have goal scoring defensemen like Coffey, Chelios, Macinnis, Bourque, the list goes on, whose style of play simply didn't exist and would not have existed prior to #4.

The idea here isn't to say \"One goal in hockey is equal to 6 home runs in baseball and 26 points in basketball, etc\" it's to say that Gretzky was so far ahead of his competition that the gap between him and anyone else who would have been considered an all time great is unlike anything seen in virtually any other professional sport. (Except maybe cricket, since that also seems a popular reply. I know next to nothing about the game to have a frame of reference, sadly.)",

            "text": "Everyone likes to talk about the \"Gretzky bothers stat\" being their favorite insane Gretzky stat.\n\nNot me. I much prefer his hat trick stats.\n\nFor those that don't know hockey, getting a hat trick (where a single player scores 3 or more goals in a game) is one of the hardest things for a player in the NHL to do. It's one of the rarest events (something like less than 3% of games feature a hat trick by **ANY** player participating in the game).\n\nCurrently, there are 32 teams in the NHL and they all play 82 games a season. That means there are 2624 games in an NHL season. If 3% of those games feature a hat trick, there are roughly 79 hat tricks a season. \n\nGretzky had 50 career regular season hat tricks in the 20 seasons he played (1487 games), and while I can't find the specific dates for them, I'm fairly certain somewhere in the neighborhood of 25-35 of them were in his first six seasons (approx 480 games). In fact, he had 10 hat tricks in a season *twice* in those first six seasons.\n\nGretzky also had 10 post-season (playoffs) hat tricks during his career, but people who discuss hockey stats don't usually discuss or refer to playoff stats.\n\nCurrently, the active NHL player with the most amount of regular season hat tricks is Alex Ovechkin with 28. He's in his 17th Season and is widely considered one of the best goal-scorers of all time. If he can stay healthy for another four or five seasons and continue to score at the rate he's scored at most of his career he just may surpass Gretzky's goal total (but not his points total as OV doesn't get nearly as many assists as Gretzky did). That said, it's highly unlikely OV will end up with more than 35 regular season hat tricks in his career. Gretzky likely had as many hat tricks in his first six seasons as OV has in 17 seasons.\n\nAnother up-and-coming goal-scoring phenom is Auston Matthews, who is currently in his 6th NHL season. Matthews won the Rocket Richard trophy (awarded to the player who scores the most goals in a season) last season, is on pace to win it this season, and likely would have won it two seasons ago if Covid hadn't caused the season to be cancelled 80% of the way through. That is to say, that of his six season career, Matthews has been the best goal-scoring player (or is on pace/was on pace to be) three times... and yet, despite being the goal-scoring phenom that he is, Matthews has only ever had 5 hat tricks. Again, by the end of his sixth season, Gretzky had 25-35.\n\nGretzky's 50 hat tricks stats are ridiculous!",

            "text": "Gretzky was the fastest player to score 1000 points (after 424 games). He's also the second fastest to score 1000 points (after another 433 games). No other player in NHL history hit 2000 points. \n\nIn terms of point production, the closest comparable is Jaromir Jagr (who's still playing in Europe at 50 years old) who finished with 1921 points (which is about 40 points shy of Gretzky's assist total alone, which is absolutely bonkers). Jagr played 4 more seasons than Gretzky. On top of that, Gretzky hit point #1921 at 28 years old - Jagr was in his 40s. Jagr is the 14th fastest player to hit 1000 points, which he did in 763 games (almost the number of games it took Gretzky to hit 2000 points). Hypothetically, if Gretzky were to continue playing until he hit another 1000 points, at the rate he was producing after point #2000 (approximately 1.36 points per game, which that alone is crazy for a player to do that during their \"worst\" years), he would've likely still been the ninth fastest player to hit 1000 points (at around 735-736 games).\n\nSome other really ridiculous Gretzky stats:\n\n- He won the Art Ross Trophy (for most points in a season) by a margin of 70 points six times. In the NHL today, it's not unusual for players to put up just 70 points and be one of the best on a team. \n\n- Only 5 players ever hit 150 points in a season: Gretzky did it 9 times. \n\n- Gretzky is the only player to hit 200 points in a season: he did it 4 times (3 times consecutively). \n\n- Only around 50 players have scored 23 short handed goals: Gretzky did that in just two seasons.\n\n- If Gretzky continued playing and didn't score a single point the rest of his career, he would've still be a point per game player until the 2017-18 season.\n\n- Only 9* players have scored fifty goals in fifty games. Gretzky did it three times, including once where he scored fifty goals in 39 games. (*if you refer to their fiftieth game and not their team's fiftieth - otherwise it's only 5 players, and Gretzky still has done it 3 times).\n\n- Gretzky has the most goals in a single season at 92. He finished that season with a 9 game goalless streak.\n\n- In 1983-84, Gretzky started the season with a 51 game point streak where he had 153 points. He would've still won the scoring title if he didn't score another point that season.\n\n- Only one team in NHL history kept Gretzky to under a point per game: the Florida Panthers. He played 20 games against Florida in his career and *only* put up 17 points against them. The Panthers did not exist for about 75% of Gretzky's career.\n\n- The team where Gretzky had the most points per game against was the Nashville Predators, where he had 4 points per game against them (he only played two games against Nashville, as they entered the league shortly before his retirement).\n\n- Gretzky has the NHL record for hattricks with 50. There are approximately 6500 players in the NHL.com database, and of those approximately 1700 players have scored 50 career goals. In other words, Wayne Gretzky has more hattricks than 74% of all players who ever played in the NHL have goals.\n\n- An entire family of NHL players, the Sutters (Brian, Darryl, Duane, Brent, Rich, and Ron) have a total of 2936 points (a little over what Gretzky has). Gretzky played approximately one third of the games that they did.\n\n- Speaking of families, Wayne and his brother, Brent, are the highest scoring pair of siblings in NHL history. Brent had 4 points.",

Gretzky had a hat trick less than halfway through the game. He ended up not scoring any more goals after that, but the whole building was buzzing with the feeling that he might score eight or ten. It of course didn’t happen, but it felt to all of us like it really could. \n\nHis third goal was a play so insane that it was hard to believe that it happened. Gretzky chased down a puck that seemed like a fruitless effort, but the goaltender got faked completely out of position and two defenders ran into one another. I know it sounds like a farcical scene from a movie, but I swear that Gretzky made the whole thing happen. No other Kings player was involved in the play. He flipped the puck into an empty net from a very sharp angle. The entire crowd oohed and quivered while it was unfolding and went ballistic when the light went on. Every fan was looking at someone next to them to confirm that they hadn’t been dreaming. It had really happened. When they showed it on the replay afterward, everyone swooned all over again. It was like we had witnessed the hand of God or something. \n\nI’m sure I sound like a crazy person right now, but if anything I’m underselling how amazing it was. It was one of the most incredible things I’ve witnessed in my life.

Had no clue he was my client that day until I saw guys running behind him as he walked towards my way. 👀",
