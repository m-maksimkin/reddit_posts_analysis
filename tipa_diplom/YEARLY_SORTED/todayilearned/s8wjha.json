Let's say we have a circle with a radius of exactly that size (or 25 billion miles in diameter) and we want to calculate the circumference, which is pi times the radius times 2. Using pi rounded to the 15th decimal, as I gave above, that comes out to a little more than 78 billion miles. We don't need to be concerned here with exactly what the value is (you can multiply it out if you like) but rather what the error in the value is by not using more digits of pi. In other words, by cutting pi off at the 15th decimal point, we would calculate a circumference for that circle that is very slightly off. It turns out that our calculated circumference of the 25 billion mile diameter circle would be wrong by 1.5 inches. Think about that. We have a circle more than 78 billion miles around, and our calculation of that distance would be off by perhaps less than the length of your little penis.",

It is not exactly pi. It is, IIRC, 8 or 9 significant digits long. It's not that the more values you use, the more accurate your answer will be. No. This truncated value is what was used to calculate some of the orbital parameters of the satellites' orbits. The satellites are continuously transmitting those orbital parameters to your hand-held GPS receiver (though if you're using a phone, you probably downloaded those same tables of values from the cell phone network because it is faster). To reconstruct the satellite orbits, thereby allowing it to figure out where the satellites are, and thus where YOU are, your GPS receiver must use that same value of pi. \n\nFailure to do this, and doing something like using a value of pi that you would get from wikipedia or any math program will cause your position estimate to be off by hundreds of meters, possibly a few kilometers. The sensitivity of the position fixes to differing precision on pi was large enough that it was determined that a pi-like number that was exact in base-10 was necessary. \n\n\nSo yeah, there is such a thing as unnecessary precision. There's another thing the concept of specified precision. PI_GPS is not pi. It is just a constant that is fairly close to pi. \n\n\nIf any one is curious and wants to read the GPS Signal In Space Interface Control Document (ICD), it is publicly available, and makes for interesting reading. Anyone wanting to know more about the radio signals that travel from 20 million meters above you, down to your handheld receiver should... honestly look for other sources, because the ICD is dry AF.",

(I calculated this all once, but its from memory right now, so please bear with me, im sure some of these are off a bit). At this scale, the Milky Way would be maybe Wisconsin-sized.\n\nVoyager I, a probe we launched into the great unknown 50 years ago into our Wisconsin-sized galaxy at 17 km/s, would be about half an inch away.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. I haven't introduced you to Sammy yet.\n\nMeet Sammy the Snail. Sammy is no ordinary snail, he's an explorer! And today he set out to explore your street. Moving at 1 millimeter per second (sprint mode!), Sammy sets off. About halfway through the day, Sammy looks back, and he can see your house, and its a good half a football field away. Not bad, Sammy, not bad! But Sammy isn't done. By the end of the month, he's gone about a mile. Impressive! Now let's say Sammy wants to explore your ENTIRE street. His left tentacle, to be precise. After heading out a mile, Sammy turns around, moves one millimeter over, and heads back. After returning to your house, he moves another millimeter over, and heads out again. And he does this until his left tentacle has explored your entire street, one square millimeter at a time. That would take a long time, wouldn't it?\n\nBut forget that. Sammy wants to explore the nearest star. (yes, Sammy is omnipotent, except for his speed.) So he starts chasing Voyager I. You know, the probe that's gone half an inch towards a star that's 50 feet away in 50 years? That one. That would take a long time, wouldn't it?\n\nBut forget that. The closest star is only 4 light years away. Sammy wants to explore all the stars. There's at least 10 billion of them in the galaxy, and most of them are tens of thousands of light years away. So that's gonna take awhile, but he's determined.\n\nYou know what? this galaxy aint big enough for Sammy. He wants to explore the nearest galaxy. Its not thousands of light years away, but millions. So this is his biggest trip yet, but he's not intimidated. So he sets off, at 1 millimeter a second, to find the nearest galaxy.\n\nBut forget about that. He wants to explore all the galaxies. there can't be more than a 100 billion galaxies out there, right? that might take a while, but Sammy is immortal, so he has time.\n\nYou know, no one thinks about the spaces in between the stars and the galaxies... but Sammy does! That's why he wants to visit them, too. So Sammy takes off and he literally travels to the end of the universe, 13 billion light years away. And when he gets there, he moves over one millimeter, and heads back. When he gets back, he goes the other way, 13 billion light years, turns around, and heads back. Like a 3D lawn mower, Sammy goes out and comes back, moving over 1 millimeter each time, and sometimes up 1 millimeter, and sometimes down 1 millimeter, until he's visited every single corner of our universe. Now THAT would take a long time.\n\nWhich brings me to the big question that I think you all knew was coming.\n\nHow many seconds would it take Sammy to complete this colossal cosmic journey?\n\nThe answer is about 10^(90) seconds.\n\nSo.... yeah. I can't really explain how big 10^(100,000) is, my teaser was just to throw you off (sorry). But hopefully now you have a feeling for how big 10^(90) is at least.\n\nTL;DR Exponents are powerful.",
