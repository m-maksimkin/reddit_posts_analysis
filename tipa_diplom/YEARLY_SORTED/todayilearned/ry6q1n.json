Poor thing was running around aimlessly in the street around midnight.\n\nI had taken my car to go get some soda at the corner store & put some gas in my car and I saw it running about, so I swerved to avoid it and thought to myself \"that's kinda funny\".\n\nAbout 10 minutes later when I get back home I see it still running around in the street and my mindset changed from \"that's funny\" to \"Something's wrong\". So I text my girlfriend and she mentions I should call animal control to check it out.\n\nI call the animal control for my city and they mention they only have one team around at this time and they probably won't be able to check it out until tomorrow morning, so after I hung up I put on a gas mask and some safety goggles and went back out with a cardboard box (to shield myself in case it tried to spray me) to try and find it myself.\n\nPoor thing was running around in someone's driveway and kept banging into the side of the house/the wheels of the car. Eventually it manages to make it's way back onto the street (I didn't want to approach someone's actual house wearing a gas mask + safety goggles at midnight, that would've been awkward to explain if someone had seen me) and I managed to get ahold of the cup without getting sprayed. I hold it steady and the skunk manages to pop it's head out the other end.\n\nWe stared at each other for a couple seconds - it looked like it was poised to spray for a moment - but then it just bolted in the opposite direction.\n\nTL;DR if you're gonna dispose of a McFlurry cup, obviously put it in an actual trash bin, but please take the stupid lid off before tossing it out.
