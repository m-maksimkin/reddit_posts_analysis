That is because we don't know what the speed of light is when comming from the North Star towards Earth.\n\n\nAt this point, you might be quite confused.\n\nTurns out, we don't know what the speed of light is in *any* particular direction, because *no one actually measured the speed of light in one direction*.\n\n\nAt this point, you're probably even getting a bit angry, because everybody knows that the speed of light is 299792458 m/s, so wtf am I even talking about...\n\n\nWell, turns out, that's actually *the average speed of light* measured in two opposite directions, because it's the only way we can experimentally determine the speed of light.\n\n\nFor all we know, the speed of light could be 98% of average speed of light in one direction, and 102% of C in the other direction. In the most extreme case, it could be half the speed of light in one direction, and *instantaneous* in the opposite direction. **We could not tell.**\n\n\nBut, coming back to our example, this means that the light coming from the North Star could be from 868 years ago (instead of 434), or maybe, it could from 0 years ago. The light coming towards us could be instantaneous, meaning we could actually be seeing the North Star *in real time*. The thing is, even if we managed to comunicate with an intelligent lifeform on the North Star (that somehow survives on a massive star) it would take 868 years for us to hear the answer. Even if we lived forever and had all the time to chat, it would be impossible to understand what the speed of light is in any direction, meaning we (or they) don't know how old are the messages that we (or they) receive. This completely ruins our idea of simultaneity. What is *now* for us could be *now* for them, or it could be *now* for us and *434 years ago* for them, it really depends on the speed of light.\n\n\nIf you have 19 minutes to spend on a very well thought video on this subject by youtuber Veritasium (featuring SmarterEveryDay), [here is the link to the video.](https://youtu.be/pTn6Ewhb27k)",

Instead,stars are \"pointlike\" sources of light, meaning that they're essentially less than a pixel wide, even at the highest magnification. The only reason they're visible at all is that they put out so much light that it essentially fills up the pixel, and even pours over a little bit due to how imperfect our eyes and telescopes are. That's why brighter stars loom bigger.\n\nMost of the stuff we know about stars isn't from directly observing them, but is instead from what we can theorize from the properties and fluctuations of those 1 pixels of light.\n\nWe can tell the composition of stars by looking at the spectrum of light, but the stuff we theorize about structures is mostly from the fluctuations of light. Stuff like pulsars, exoplanets, binary systems, etc are all based on how the light fluctuates between stars.\n\n\nRecently though, we've been able to take *direct* pictures if close stars, and even get picture of pointlike exoplanets, which is a really amazing thing. Here'a a wikipedia article of photos of actually imaged stars:\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_with_resolved_images\n\nGiven all this, it just makes that black hole image from a while ago much more amazing, since it was millions of times farther away than anythjng else we've directlt imaged.",
