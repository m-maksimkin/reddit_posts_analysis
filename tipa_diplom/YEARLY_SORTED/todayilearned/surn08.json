Only the spores can receive nutrients, the sticks ones will sacrifice themselves and die...\nNow this is contrary to the evolution theory right? It is supposed to that each bacterium wants to survive! \nYou might say it is what evolution did, those sticks will perish because of how they evolution, natural selection,  right? NO, THE AMAZING thing is that each bacterium is equally capable to shape as bottom sticks or top spores, same capability. \nNow, how this one cell creature knows how to do that? How does it feel the diminishing of nutrients? How does it understand it needs to take this shape and how does it understand the concept of sacrificing itself for the survival of others? It's just ONE cell!\n\nThere are other examples like that in the world, against the material explanation of the universe, baffling , defying anyone who think we are just matter. \n\nThat fungus example is also amazing when you think about it. \n\nSorry for the typos",

From reading the article and research paper, it looks like we still don't know the exact mechanism the fungal cells use to control the ant's behavior. “She notes that the fungus secretes a wide range of chemicals that could influence the brain from afar.”\n\nIf it worked solely by controlling the muscles, how would the fungus “know” where to direct the ant, how to control and coordinate the muscles, etc. That's why an ant requires a nervous system. So if a bunch of fungal cells are taking over an ant's body and creating it's own de facto nervous system, it would be the first time in the history of neuroscience that such a thing was found. It,seems unlikely, but not impossible, and remains to be seen. Another possibility is that it's triggering certain behaviors by influencing the brain, obviously rather than destroying it as this article has shown.\n\nIn any case, fascinating stuff.

What I think is the most fascinating aspect of this fungus is that it helps regulate populations of insect that otherwise could overpopulate the ecosystem. Ants are terribly efficient and could easily ravage entire ecosystems within rainforests, but this fungus maintains biodiversity by targeting only a single species of ant per species of fungus. Additionally, the more sparse a species of insect is, the less likely the fungus’ spores are to find a new host, meaning it cannot kill an entire colony, it can only reduce its size. It isn’t a blight on the forest, it’s a caretaker. It prevents any one species from becoming too powerful, preserving biodiversity, and maintaining the health of the forest.",
