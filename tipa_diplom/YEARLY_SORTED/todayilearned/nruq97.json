Disney even started copying that and, even to this day, mock their old fairy tale conventions because of Shrek. It pretty much paved the way for other animated films that followed its trends, though that also meant its downsides. This was the film that made Dreamworks decide to use pop culture songs and dance parties at the end, which pretty much most other animation studios followed too. \n\nAs much as the later films felt into the tropes it popularized and his meme status, the first Shrek film has left a lasting impact and the character has evolved in various pop culture statuses.

With this story of a green-skinned, solitude-loving ogre, Shrek, who embarks on a noble quest, alongside his new friend, a lovable donkey, the film manages to be both a send-up of fairy tale tropes and an affectionate tribute to them. Entertaining and emotionally impactful at levels to be appreciated by both children and their adults, \"Shrek\" was a mega-hit upon its release and has been followed by three equally enchanting sequels, a TV holiday special and a Broadway adaption. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz lead the strong voice cast.\n\n~Library of Congress brief description",

He decided on the Scottish accent BC he felt it seemed more medieval European. Farley wasn't gonna do an accent at all. A huge part of Chris Farleys comedic talent was physical comedy, and I don't see how they could possibly capture that with an animated character.
