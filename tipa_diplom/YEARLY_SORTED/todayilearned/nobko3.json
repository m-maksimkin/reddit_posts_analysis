The deal with him making the decree in Latin is, officially, the language of the church is Latin.  All decrees, letters, appointments, laws, rules, etc are all promulgated in Latin and they are translated into different languages.  The WORKING language of the Vatican itself is Italian, but, like I said, all official pronouncements and decrees, etc. are in Latin. \n\nOn a word regarding the Latin the church uses.
