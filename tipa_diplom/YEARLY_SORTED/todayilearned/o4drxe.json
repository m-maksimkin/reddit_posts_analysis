Prior to that it was Feb 2018, but actually that was instantly deleted as well because it was behind a paywall. The most recent time this wasn't instantly deleted was Aug 2017.

As for the rest of the title:\n\n>opting for a gunshot to his chest rather than his head so as to preserve his brain for future research on the neurological disease.

            "text": "From Wikipedia:\n\n>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head. The encephalopathy symptoms can include behavioral problems, mood problems, and problems with thinking. The disease often gets worse over time and can result in dementia. It is unclear if the risk of suicide is altered.  \n>  \n>Most documented cases have occurred in athletes involved in striking-based combat sports, such as boxing, kickboxing, mixed martial arts, and Muay Thai‚Äîhence its original name dementia pugilistica (Latin for \"fistfighter's dementia\")‚Äîand contact sports such as American football, Australian rules football, professional wrestling, ice hockey, rugby, and association football (soccer), but also in semi-contact sports such as baseball and basketball. Other risk factors include being in the military, prior domestic violence, and repeated banging of the head. The exact amount of trauma required for the condition to occur is unknown, and as of 2021 definitive diagnosis can only occur at autopsy. The disease is classified as a tauopathy.\n\n^(beep boop, I'm not actually a bot, I just thought it was important for people to know if they hadn't already.)",

It opens with this paragraph:\n\n>Dave Duerson set the scene with a hangman‚Äôs care before climbing into bed with the revolver. The former Pro Bowl safety for the Super Bowl‚Äìchampion 1985 Chicago Bears drew the curtains of his beachfront Florida condo, laid a shrine of framed medals and an American flag to his father, a World War II vet, and pulled the top sheet up over his naked body, a kindness to whoever found him later. On the dining room table were notes and a typed letter that were alternately intimate and official, telling his former wife where his assets were and whom to get in touch with to settle affairs. He detailed his motives for ending his life, citing the rupture of his family and the collapse of his finances, a five-year cliff dive from multimillionaire to a man who couldn‚Äôt pay his condo fees. Mostly, though, he talked about a raft of ailments that pained and depressed him past all tolerance: starburst headaches and blurred vision, maddening craters in his short-term memory, and his helplessness getting around the towns he knew. Once a man so acute he aced his finals at Notre Dame with little study time, he found himself now having to dash down memos about what he was doing and when. Names, simple words, what he‚Äôd eaten for dinner ‚Äì it was all washing out in one long wave.",

To know your brain will inevitably turn on you. \n\nI played baseball and was a pretty reckless kid and had a few concussions then, but once I began working with students with autism I racked them up.\n\nRecently I received 3 concussions in 4 months, 2 of them within 24 hours. After the 3rd I got the proper treatment and even had a blood clot scare but I'm on the mend. I can estimate I've had 15 total concussions and because of this I need a career change. \n\nI'm pretty worried that the damage is done but am positive about the research.",
