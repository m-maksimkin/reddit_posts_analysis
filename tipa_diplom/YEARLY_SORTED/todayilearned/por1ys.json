It would have been okay if the title was ‚ÄúSeminole Child‚Äù but the ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù is not required to describe our group when you have the tribe name. \n\nSheesh, if there‚Äôs a way you can change the title and remove that word I would love you forever OP.\n\n‚ÄúWe've been called 'Indians' and 'injun' to degrade us into a position of inferiority, and that's what we're reminded of when non-Natives call us Indian,\" ‚Äî from [this article](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/a34485478/native-american-vs-american-indian-meaning/) [Here‚Äôs another](https://hechingerreport.org/student-voice-dont-call-me-indian/), and [this one is really good too](https://www.oklahoman.com/story/special/2021/04/22/what-do-native-people-prefer-called/4831284001/).\n\nI share this to educate you, because people still think we‚Äôre ‚Äúnot here‚Äù, or we‚Äôve been all killed off and kicked out of our lands (this part is true lol). And how modern times such as social media has allowed people like me to express and educate. ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù is derogatory because we have people from India, it‚Äôs derogatory because ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù indicates us Native Americans do not have an origin or place of belonging, as other ethnic groups (German, African, Chinese, Samoan,  Syrian, etc).\n\nI would really appreciate if this was upvoted and seen! I‚Äôm doing my very best every day to carry the legacy and resilience that my beautiful ancestors survived so can be here today, and to learn what was lost and taken away.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget **November is Indigenous People‚Äôs Month** ‚ù§Ô∏è (: \n\nEdit: Linky link & November :)",

I had a friend who would get $100 added to his trust everytime he got an A in school, and guess what? He is an engineer now that works for the tribe in conjunction with the state to preserve the salmon runs, has no college debt and is thriving while giving back to his community. \nOn the flip side I went to school in Montana, where they think native  Americans don't deserve anything. They're incredibly racist towards natives and think the rent the US government pays them, per their treat for taking their land, is a ‚Äúhand out‚Äù and their just lazy natives. Their reservations are far worse off. \nThe casinos are good things. Like for fuck sake. We took everything they had, broke all our treaties with them, killed their families, stole their children and sent them to schools to ‚Äú kill the indian preserve the man‚Äù where they were abused and so children were killed. Oh and then we also forcefully sterilized their women so they couldn't have anymore children and took away their ability to practice their religion. Of course they have generational trauma. Of course they can't just pull up their boot straps. This author sucks and they deserve every dumb casino dollar they've earned to rebuild their community. It is also a testament to their core culture and smarts. To fight that long and finally win government support and then actually build mini empires for their community is amazing and a testament that more socialist societies can succeed. \n\nAnother story to add to some if their genius and kindness, the Navajo nation, who was already struggling at the time, sent money to Ireland during the famine, even though it wasn't much. Recognizing the bullshit the British we're pulling to kill and control the Irish people. The Irish never forget. They still send aid and donate to Native American tribes today and recently sent support during covid when Trump was giving us all nothing. If you travel to Ireland you‚Äôll find people who know obscure tribes and states because native tribes helped them during the famine. Celtic tribes and native America tribes share very similar values. It's a bond I‚Äôll always love. \n\nK rant over. Sorry for any grammar errors, this shit just pisses me off to no end.",

This has made them BILLIONAIRES and the thing is, their band only has 50 members so each member is sort of one of the richest people in Canada.\n\nBut to keep a band at 50 members is tough because people procreate and so they've made rules to artificially limit the size of their bands.\n\nMen can marry outside of the band, women cannot.  If women marry out, they get out.  And thus there are hundreds of ex-Sawridge women across Canada who have no access to their benefits or fortune because they opted to marry out rather than marry a cousin.\n\nWhen tested in court they declared Marry Out Get Out was a protected part of their tradition and no laws on sexism could change that.\n\nThe federal government created a law that stated that if an indigenous group did not provide a proper account of spending that they would be cut off from all federal funding.  The billionaires at Sawridge argued that secrecry is a tradition of theirs protected under treaty rights and thus they're not required to expose their finances to anyone.\n\nToday Sawridge secretly has its money in everything and is secretly one of the largest investment groups in the world.\n\nThe group secretive nature has made them the indigenous boogieman of Canada (in which every indigneous group must be like them).",
