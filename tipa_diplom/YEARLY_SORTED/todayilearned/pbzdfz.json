A good amount of students with their parents attended. \n\nTo summarize, his main point was telling the girls there that their most valuable asset was what was between their legs.\n\nHe rationalized this by saying that, by its placement there and not somewhere like on an elbow, it was something that men had to work for to receive, and that this was to be leveraged. \n\nThe whole thing was weird, not just because of how absurd of a stance and choice of topic it was for a college orientation speech, but because most of these freshman students were with their parents. \n\nI didn’t know there was a negative consensus on the man until seeing this post, but I always tell people about that very strange speech he gave.",

I was out with my Grammie one afternoon with my cousin, shopping getting some new night gowns for my Grammie and other clothes after we had lunch.  I see him, and tell my Grammie, her eyes light up and I wheel her over to him with my cousin.  I told him she's a huge fan and loves his stand up and him on Family Feud, she says the same thing in her cute ole grandma way, either not remembering I just said it or she wanted to say it herself.  He didn't say anything, and then he looked my grandma dead in the eyes and said \"You ain't got much longer DO YA??\" and just bloisterousley laughed and walked away as my Grammie just stared at him in utter confusion sitting in her wheel chair.  I left my Grammie with my cousin and chased him down, I was pissed, I asked him what the fuck his problem was, he laughed again as his bitch ass hid behind I'm guessing was a body guard (like I was going to attack him?  Really?  I wouldn't pick a fight with anyone over words, that's childish, all I wanted was for him to apologise, Come on) and told him he should apologise to my Grammie as she's a huge fan and what he said was fucked up from everything she's been through, this ASSHOLE had the audacity to say \"it's not like she would remember anyway, right?\" as he walked away AGAIN laughing with his body guard right up his ass.  My Grammie was a breast cancer survivor with extreme dementia and she actually loved him as a comedian and on family feud, she was a big fan in that regard, she ended up not remembering this altercation of course, but I do.  My Grammie still continued to watch him on family feud, and when I'd visit it irked me watching him with her, but she still loved it, do I dealt with it for her.  Had she remembered though, I doubt it would be the case, it likely would have hurt her badly, and she was the sweetest person on Earth, I miss her so damn much.  People can like him, that's cool, everyone has opinions, just like I'm sure I like someone others despise, but I will forever fucking hate him.  He's soulless, and just not funny, I've always thought this, but this story definitely makes me a little bias.  If you read this Steve Harvey, Fuck You, I hope all your fake ass teeth fall out.  \n\n\nWow, that was a lot more than I thought it was\n\nTLDR, Steve Harvey made fun of my grandma who was a cancer survivor with severe dementia.
