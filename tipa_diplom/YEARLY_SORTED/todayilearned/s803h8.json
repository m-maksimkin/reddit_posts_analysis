Milk wasn't safe to drink until it was cleaned. \"Raw milk\" as people are now calling it, was just not safe. Hundreds dying because of this incident is quite few in the long-term at this period.\n\nOf course that's very Western-centric. Milk was only really widely consumed in the West. 2/3s of Asians are still lactose intolerant, for example. The lactose intolerant in the West were at a disadvantage and so died earlier and the genes involved weren't reproduced as much. Evolution. Today, those who drink \"raw milk\" are [840x](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2017/05/what-are-the-odds-840-times-more-likely-for-raw-milk-drinkers/) more likely to get a food-borne illness.\n\nThe dairy and meat industries lobbied heavily to \"normalise\" the products which had literally killed thousands on a regular basis before pasteurization and similar techniques... and they gave out free milk to schools and made their own food pyramids with, of course, dairy and meat at the top. The food pyramids taught in schools (esp. USA) were not made by educators but were lobbied by the dairy and meat industries. Of course, schools love free stuff so it went nationwide.\n\nToday, most countries have a maximum allowed amount of pus, bacteria, and blood in parts per billion. All milk will contain a certain amount of all that and it just varies what each country considers \"acceptable\". The largest study involved compared people who drank 3x glasses of milk to 1x. They found more milk led to a lot more bone fractures and [higher risk of death](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8652079/) (all-cause mortality). In short, milk is not healthy and the modern perception of milk as healthy came from very good marketing strategies by the dairy industry. Similar to how tobacco was considered \"healthy\" and they enlisted doctors to say \"more doctors smoke camels\" and such. All techniques inspired by Edward Bernays' propaganda.\n\nIf course, it's good that harmful bacteria can be killed off in pasteurisation and similar things. But it also kills the good bacteria for us. B12, for example, is produced by bacteria (bacteria take cobalt from the soil and turn it into cobalamin, B12). Even animals now require B12 supplements when farmed, because the bacterias are being killed off by modern-farming techniques. Even meat-eaters are essentially getting much of their B12 indirectly through supplements now (and often not enough, pretty much everyone should take a supplement). So it's a big trade-off (pros and cons).\n\nTL;DR: There are much better ways of getting your calcium and protein needs without the bacteria, fats, and other negatives.",

Every bottle had at least a little left over, and there were people who would come by and collect this 'loose milk'. Lots of orphanages consumed this, and a lot of kids died. It took years for people to figure out loose milk that had spoiled could and did kill a lot of kids. I know an old guy who has records from early milk associations as they realized milk that is spoiled enough can have deadly poisons in it. Infant mortality was a thing.

I’m definitely a person who gets annoyed with governmental overreach and nanny state ethics, but there is definitely significant value in having a government ensure safe food supply. That’s not the only thing where a strong federal government benefits the people, but certainly one that often gets overlooked these days.

Sacred Scripture also reveals that the time given to the Church's mission is two days (two thousand years), which end in 2033, since the Church was founded in the year 33.The next facts that will impact the world are:1- The uprising of the world ruler (antichrist). 2- Martyrdom of Christians and the rapture of the Church. 3-The third world war and the greatmassacre of the Jewish nation by Russia. After these three episodes, Christ, THE KING OF JERUSALEM, will descend together with his saints, on the mount of ol!ves, for the implantation of the millennial government (Rev. 19:15). The war and its end will take place according to Zechariah 14: Israel on the brink of extermination, and the annihilation of world military forces. Thus will be the second coming of the one who was killed and revived. In this glorious episode many willdie, but others will be preserved on earth. Being the conqueror of all armies, the world comes to belong to Christ, the King of Jerusalem. {Rev. 11:15). Now, we, incorruptib le disciples, for a thousand years, will reorganize planet earth (the only planet with intelligent life). 1- The Judiciary System will be extinguished. 2- Police and armies from all over the world will have new and unique command. 3- Traffics and militias will be extinguished, now Christianity reigns in the scepter of the Gospel. 4- Nobody else will say my door or my house, everything will be from the conqueror of the valley of Armageddon. 5- The Creator of the coronavlrus, will exterminate all pests, automatically sentencing Science to its end. 6- The world speaks one language again (Gen. 11: 1). 7-We will not eat meat, there will beno blood shedIn the personal kingdom of Jesus Christ. 8-AIIpagan temples, catholics, spirftists, assemblies of god, baptists, and movements called evangelicals will be sealed at the disposal of the Great King of Jerusalem, and no spiritual entity will ever be mentioned again. Truth and justice assume their throne over humanity. Soon, after the coronavirus, we will have hunger, pests, plagues, and a class of self-loving politica l leaders who, like leeches, will not get enough of their robberies and murders, taking advantage of catastrophes to get rich, they have until 2033 to settle accounts. The \n\ncurriculum of the faculties will undergo changes, and my brothers and I will witness In the Universities, where all the Constitutions will be extinguished, and the Glorious Gospel of the Kingdom will be taught to all people, then the end willcome (Matt. 24:14). \n\nGeneration Jesus Christ Pr.
